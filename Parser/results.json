            "Text": "HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Lahore Qalandars became the first-ever team to defend their champions title, when they beat Multan Sultans by just one run at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore on Saturday.\nThe HBL PSL8 final was preponed to Saturday from initially planned Sunday after rain threatened to ruin the fun of the marquee match. Sunday and Monday were then kept as reserve days to ensure completion of the 20-overs-a-side match.\nHowever on Saturday, the match was saturated with drama and nothing else.\nIt all came down to the last ball of the match with Multan needing four to win from one last ball. Khushdil Shah tried to steal three from the deep fielder on the leg side but bowler Zaman Khan used his brains to collect the ball and remove the stumps to help Lahore go past the finish line.\n\u201cShaheen told me to do what I do best, bowl yorkers. However, in between deliveries I planned to throw a slower-one in the mix as well which thankfully paid off,\u201d said Zaman after the match.\nLahore opted to bat first and courtesy captain Shaheen\u2019s ballistics reached 200-6 in their 20 overs. The left-arm pacer, who has improved his batting massively all thanks to former all-rounder Shahid Afridi\u2019s mentorship, hit 44 runs off just 15 balls courtesy five sixes and two fours.\n\u201cIt was a team effort,\u201d said Shaheen when asked about the secret recipe. \u201cWe had belief in ourselves and we won in the end.\u201d\nLahore\u2019s cause was powered by a 65 off 40 balls by Abdullah Shafique too after openers Mirza Baig (30) and Fakhar Zaman (39 off 34) gave Lahore a moderate start.\n\u201cI would like to thank the captain and the management for backing me and every player,\u201d said Shafique.\nFor Multan, leg-spinner Usama Mir was the bowler of the day with 3-24 from his over three overs. Meanwhile, pacers Anwar Ali, Ihsanullah and left-arm spinner Khushdil Shah bagged one wicket each.\nZimbabwe all-rounder Sikandar Raza was delighted that their batting and bowling experiments throughout the tournament paid off in the final.\n\u201cWe received a lot of criticism for changing our batting and bowling orders throughout the event. But we wanted everyone to have wickets and runs under their belt so they could take some confidence into the final,\u201d said Raza.\n\u201cEvery player in our team is a match-winner. The fact that every match had a different player-of-the-match in Lahore\u2019s victories proves that.\u201d\nWith the newly-minted Supernova trophy, Lahore also took home Rs120 million as a reward for their triumph. On the other hand, the second-placed finishers Multan were handed a cheque of Rs48 million as a consolation prize.\n\u2018Great tournament\u2019\nEnglish keeper-batter Sam Billings was all praise for the Lahore crowd after the match, saying the experience of playing in the HBL PLS8 was amazing.\n\u201cThe crowd has been absolute magic. It shows the love the game that people here [in Pakistan] have,\u201d said Billings. \u201cBeing a part of a champion team always feels good. My first experience was great in HBL PSL. I would love to come back to this tournament.\u201d\nAll-rounder David Wiese was also ecstatic after the victory.\n"

            "Text": "The successful return of PTI chief Imran Khan from the Judicial Complex in Islamabad where he appeared for a hearing in the Toshakhana reference has senior lawyers believing that he holds sway over judiciary unlike PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif.\nPolitical analysts believe that the next couple of weeks will be crucial to decide whether the Punjab Assembly elections would be held on time or something would happen out of the box to curtail Imran\u2019s pressure.\nIt is being witnessed that the PTI chief has given directions to his followers to question the authority of the security establishment as he blames it for his current troubles on the political front.\nReportedly, there is severe trust deficit between Imran and the 'powerful circles'. Imran was also among those who made controversies regarding the nominations of army chief before the process even started.\nAlso read: Imran, others booked on terror charges over Islamabad judicial complex clashes\nOn the other hand, the major ruling political parties \u2013 PML-N, PPP and JUI-F) want to obtain advantage from the prevailing political situation. However, their big challenge is not the popularity of Imran but the worsening economic condition of the country.\nThough Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar agreed for a political dialogue with the PTI, the PDM leadership has disassociated itself from the law minister\u2019s offer.\nPolitical analysts say that the major ruling parties are convinced that it is difficult for them to confront Imran in the political field at the present. These parties are more interested in getting him disqualified from the court of law.\nHowever, political analysts did not see these ruling parties gain any advantage if Imran is disqualification before the elections.\nA senior PTI leader is hopeful that their relationship with the establishment will improve and signs in this regard will begin to appear soon.\nDebate has also started on available options for powerful circles in case they fail to curtail Imran.\nOne of the top legal minds of a ruling party expressed his apprehension that if the situation will get out of control then any step can be taken by powerful circles.\nTherefore, the next two weeks are very curicial.\nHowever, role of the superior judiciary will be significant in the prevailing political situation.\nRead more: Who attacked police if Bushra Bibi was alone at Zaman Park, asks Maryam\nThe PTI\u2019s main objective is to linger the Toshakhana case till the general elections of the National Assembly. The role of Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial will be significant in this connection.\nThe chief justice is known as a \u2018balancing judge\u2019 who does not give a free hand to one side to suppress the other since April last year.\nHe is retiring in September this year. His legacy is dependent on holding of the general elections during his tenure. However, the Supreme Court itself is facing a crisis of polarisation wherein judges are questioning each other\u2019s conduct in their judicial orders.\nLikewise, powerful circles are also upset over the suo motu proceedings regarding the holding of general elections of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa assemblies within 90 days. CJP Bandial is among those judges who did not pass coercive orders against the powerful circles.\nThe apex court is still facing a shortage of two judges. The senior judges could not evolve a consensus on the nominees for their elevation to the SC.\nIt is witnessed that after the happenings in the last couple of weeks, it is not just Imran but the judiciary is also facing a trial.\nThe PDM-led government wants Imran disqualified before the general elections.\nIt has been learnt that the PTI\u2019s legal team has decided to approach the superior courts against the PDM leaders, who acquired gifts from the Toshakhana at lower prices.\nPolirisation has increased in every segment of society. Judges as well as bars are also divided.\nSenior lawyers say that if powerful circles take any step to tackle the PTI then the role of judiciary will be significant. Senior lawyers are criticising Imran for using party workers as protective shields in order to avert his possible arrest. They say that Imran is setting a bad precedent which may follow his rivals in case of their possible arrest.\n"

            "Text": "After days of boiling tensions and escalating violence, which culminated in the raid on Zaman Park on Saturday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that if anyone had any doubt, PTI Chairman Imran Khan\u2019s \u201cantics\u201d of the last past few days had \u201claid bare his fascist and militant tendencies\u201d.\nOn his Twitter handle, the premier said, \u201cFrom using people as human shields to throwing petrol bombs at police to leading \u2018jathas\u2019 to intimidate judiciary, he (Imran) has taken a leaf out of the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) book.\u201d\nSeparately, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb, while addressing a press conference, said that all state institutions were responsible for the establishment of the writ of the government.\nAllowing the accused to come to courts with crowds would give a message that the justice system and law in Pakistan were afraid of terrorists, thugs, goons, threats and abuses, she added.\nThe minister claimed that Imran was not afraid of playing with national interests, hatching conspiracies and blatantly violating the law and the Constitution of Pakistan.\nThe federal government also indicated initiating the legal procedure to ban the former ruling party.\nFederal Minister for Interior Rana Sanaullah, while addressing a presser at the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz\u2019s (PML-N) secretariat in Model Town, Lahore, said that enough things have come to light to file a reference against PTI, and PML-N\u2019s legal team is now considering. He added that a party can only be banned through the courts.\nHe said that the Punjab Police acted in a no-go area with the help of other law enforcement agencies. \u201cA so-called political leader had created an atmosphere of fear,\u201d he said, taking a jibe at Imran, and added that he was running a movement to avoid jail \u201cas a woman\u201d.\nHe said that when there was \u201cresistance\u201d to the compliance of the court\u2019s order, the impression was strengthened that there might be a terrorist organisation there. He added that 65 persons had been arrested from outside of the former prime minister\u2019s house, most of whom do not belong to Punjab and their role is \u201csuspicious\u201d, while weapons, grenades, and petrol bomb-making equipment were also recovered from there.\nSanaullah claimed that Imran\u2019s aim is to spread sedition and anarchy in the country, and he had been \u201cpursuing his agenda for the last 10 years\u201d. He added that the PTI chief was \u201cwilling to riot\u201d even when he was in the government.\nThe PML-N leader claimed that Imran reached the court premises with a group of at least 300 to 400 armed men. He added that the police had to use force to remove the people.\nHe alleged that the former premier uses the notion of threat to life as an excuse.\n\u201cThey know they are lying because they want to avoid legal action, so they talk about security threats,\u201d he added.\nMeanwhile, Maryam Nawaz, the chief organiser of PML-N, rejected the PTI chief\u2019s claim that his wife Bushra Bibi was alone at his Zaman Park residence in Lahore when Punjab police conducted a \u2018surprise search operation\u2019 there earlier today.\nReacting to his statement, Maryam in a series of tweets, said that if there was only a woman present inside the house then who was \u201cfiring bullets and throwing petrol bombs at the police from inside?\u201d\nShe also shared a purported video \u2013 which others claimed to be fake \u2013 on her Twitter timeline wherein a man can be seen throwing some explosive from the PTI chief\u2019s Lahore residence.\n\u201cDidn't I say that this [PTI] is a terrorist group whose leader is housing miscreants and trained terrorists in his house to avoid the law and punishment? Previously, such scenes were seen only in matters related to terrorism. Shameful!,\u201d she added.\nIn another tweet, Maryam said brave politicians do not fear arrest and accountability. \u201cOnly thieves, bandits, and terrorists fear arrest and accountability.\u201d\nFurthermore, Federal Minister for Law Azam Nazeer Tarar, while addressing a presser, said that after the former premier appeared outside the courtroom in the Toshalhana case and his arrest warrant was cancelled, the courts should remove the impression that justice is the same for all since \u201cit is not the same\u201d.\nHe said that the court opened in the evening and gave bail in nine cases.\n"

It will be more like a referendum,\u201d he said. It will tell the nation where the public stands and where the cabal of crooks and their handlers stand,\u201d he added.\nPreviously, the PTI had announced that it would hold a public rally at Minar-e-Pakistan on Sunday. However, the Lahore High Court (LHC) had instructed the party to reschedule the rally in consultation with the district administration.\nCondemning Saturday\u2019s police action at his residence, Imran lashed out at the inspector general (IG) of the Punjab police and the officers involved in the raid. He accused the police of breaking down the main gate and exterior wall of his house.\n\u201cAt the time of attack\u201d, Imran said, \u201conly his wife, Bushra Bibi, and a few domestic help were present. I want to ask everyone, police, army, judges and citizens about the respect of \u2018Chadar and Char Dewari\u2019 [privacy of the home] in Islam.\u201d\nThe PTI chief alleged that there was video evidence that officials looted whatever they could find at his residence. \u201cIs the police supposed to loot homes. Do you have a little shame,\u201d he questioned.\n\u201cExactly what is my crime? The nation knows I always abide by the law,\u201d Imran said. \u201cBut this fascist government has registered 96 cases against me. More cases are registered, whenever I leave my house,\u201d he added.\nImran said when he returned to Lahore the other night he was angry at the police action at his residence, therefore, he decided not give his speech. \u201cIt was good that I did not address yesterday \u2026 a person should not speak, when angry,\u201d he maintained.\nThe PTI chairman reiterated that the coalition government of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was behind the attempt on his life in Wazirabad in November last year and added that they had the support of their handlers.\nGiving a recap of the recent events, Imran said after announcement of the election schedule, his party decided to kick-start its election campaign by holding a rally in Lahore on March 8.\n\u201cOn the night of March 7, we finalised every detail with the police as to how the rally would proceed. We got permission. The next day, as we were about to start, the interim government imposed Section 144 and police appeared clad in riot gear,\u201d he said.\n\u201cHow could Section 144 [ban on public gatherings] be imposed after the announcement of election schedule,\u201d Imran asked. He added that when the rally started moving, the police used water cannons and tear gas against PTI workers.\n\u201cSubsequently, I had to cancel [the rally] because I knew that they are trying to make the situation worse to find an excuse to escape the elections,\u201d he continued. He said that there were constant attacks at his home.\nThe police operation at Zaman Park, the former prime minister said, was the reason he asked for shifting of the hearing of the case against him to another place in Islamabad. The F-8 Kachehry was a death trap,\u201d he added.\nAbout the arrest warrants, Imran said, a posse of police officers raided his residence to \u201cimplement the warrants issued by a magistrate\u201d but when warrants for Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah were issued, no action was taken\u201d.\nSpeaking about the turn of events on Saturday during his court appearance, Imran asked if he just had to mark his attendance in a court in Islamabad, why his home was being attacked from three sides.\n\u201cYesterday, when I left my house, I said goodbyes to my wife. I had in mind that I might either be arrested or killed. Then, Rangers arrived in armoured vehicles, jumping over the walls like some commando action was taking place,\u201d he claimed.\nHe added that when he reached the Toll Plaza, police had closed the motorway and only one lane was open. \u201cThey had thought that once my car left, they would close it behind me so that rest of the cars could not follow,\u201d he said.\nBy this, he alleged, the government had either planned to isolate and kill him on his way to the Judicial Complex, or they wanted to arrest him and shift him to Balochistan. However, the people came out to receive and protect him.\n\u201cWhen we got close to the Judicial Complex, police started firing tear gas shells relentlessly. We waited outside the Judicial Complex as the situation deteriorated,\u201d the PTI chief continued.\n"

            "Text": "As the only nuclear-powered Muslim nation nears it\u2019s 999th round of begging for money, it\u2019s worth reflecting what is holding the country back. The nation runs on a weak implementation of tax collection and debt, which results in huge outflow of payments towards interest, pensions, defense, and government expenditures. This leaves little for developmental projects.\nThe combined spending on education, with all provinces combined, is under five billion rupees. Over 20 million children are out of school. This could mean that taxation reforms are at the center of Pakistan\u2019s reform. In a country of 220 million, there are 2.7 million tax filers and just 7 million tax payers. With paying taxes, citizens lack a relationship with the state and it\u2019s future.\n\nTax to GDP should be 13 per cent and it is eight per cent, which is 50 per cent below capacity of resources if utilised ethically. The highest income tax slab is charged 32 per cent and the sales tax is 17 per cent, which are both regressive for the one per cent actually holding up the country and then penalising them for buying local goods. Due to lobbyists in the parliament, agriculture is not taxed and gets subsidies for urea.\n\nDue to subsidies around sugar, crop planning is poor and water is misused, meanwhile the export dependent crop of cotton has drastically fallen in output. There is one school of thought that technological problem solving could improve the productivity of the agricultural sector, which in turn would incentivize the one per cent to invest in similar technologies themselves.\n\nAgriculture represents around 22 per cent of the economy, 34 per cent of the labour force, and has yields that are between 40 to 50 per cent worse than the global average. This is a problem that companies such as Farmdar and Jiye Tech intend to solve, as will others as National Incubation Center (NIC) Faisalabad invited AgriTech companies in its inaugural cohort. There are opportunities for crop planning, inputs, yield enhancement, to eliminate food waste in farm-to-fork.\n\nIn the most realistic scenario, the parlimentarian that depends on low-outputs in order to justify interest free loans, will never sign off anything that brings efficiency and hard work to the table. Representing just one per cent of the problem, this means that there are no incentives for the elite of Pakistan, most of whom inherited wealth through deals with the British Empire, to lobby for reform that saves Pakistan from the annual embarrassment of handouts.\n\n\u201cRegulatory capture, guaranteed returns, subsidised inputs, state-backed cartels, and monopolies are sponsored by chambers of commerce, biz councils, and industry-specific associations,\u201d said Babar Khan Javed, a director of Z2C Limited. \u201cPakistan doesn't need aid, it needs to fix it's own asinine ideas on how to run an economy.\u201d\nHe said that the four men running Pakistan need to develop a framework for a STEM talent-based economy for the next decade. He postulated that in doing so, Pakistan will never have to beg for money ever again, thereby actually acting like an Islamic republic. This is the solution towards increasing the export-led and talent-led GDP for Pakistan.\n\nWhat is the next productive lever to pull?\nIn an interview with a news channel, Systems Limited chief Asif Peer stated that freelancers may be bringing in between $500 million to $1 billion into Pakistan. He said that, in bring freelancers into the official record through incentives, the contributions of the ICT sector would near $3 billion annually.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re currently at an annual growth rate of 40 per cent to 50 per cent, which means in five years we can cross $10 billion worth of ICT export earnings,\u201d said Peer. \u201cWe first need to tackle the issue of talent supply, which is insufficient to reach this goal. Since COVID-19, the demand for freelancers went up faster than the supply of workers was being trained or graduating. You need graduate or train 40,000 programmers annually to add $1 billion to ICT exports in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology in the Government of India, ICT exports during FY 2021 in the the most populous democracy in the world were $172 billion. A 2019 survey by the National Association of Software and Service Companies found that 1.5 million people graduate with engineering degrees every year in India. According to some estimates, Pakistan produces under 3 per cent of India\u2019s output and that too at a questionable quality.\n\nCan this be fixed?\n\nThe Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) graduates co-founders and chief executives of the $75 billon worth InfoSys, $40 billion worth Flipkart, and $5.5 billion worth Zomato. There is not a single equivalent executive graduate from IBA or LUMS.\nGiven that government intervention and reform is a pipe dream, the consensus is that market leaders must partner with educational institutions to ensure courses match the needs of the current and future job market. Multi-million dollar companies such as Systems Limited and Walee have signed MoUs with universities around the country to introduce courses that represent industry-academia collaboration.\n\nTo speed up the process, venture accelerator Z2C Limited launched fast-track courses with various educational institutions around the country. This year, they launched the Creators Academy with Off The School (OTS) in January, the ACE Digital School in February, and the ZEAL Future Enablement Program at Ziauddin University in March.\n\nOTS runs a school within a mosque of Jamshed Town where nearly two thousand indigent students are enrolled out of which majority of them are hailing from lesser developed areas. At a nominal fee of PKR 1,000-1,500 for entire 6\u201312-week programs on various in-demand skillsets that will enable to find job opportunities like English Language, Photoshop, Digital Marketing, Programming etc. all being taught by working professionals.\nThe program recently graduated 12 students out of 25 attendees under a training progran for Google web design, which lasted six weeks. Three of the graduates were hired by Activ8, the largest offshore hub for creative, media, and digital projects under the Publicis Groupe.\n\nGiven that Activ8 works on campaigns for Publicis Groupe clients in the MENA region, the ACE Digital School trains new hires to reach regional benchmarks and partake in on the job training. This is the accelerate hiring at Activ8, which onboards roughly 15 new employees every month, as quality digital marketing talent is scarce in the MENA region.\n\nThe ZEAL Future Enablement Program at Ziauddin University brings together Activ8 and digital agency East River to facilitate 12-week sprint course trainings that cover digital marketing, creative strategy, media optimization, and the use of various planning tools.\nBoth Systems and Z2C would be better off integrating with freelancer networks such as Linkstar to facilitate the demand side of the equation, once supply has been generated.\n\nSimilar to India, which have over 20 campuses nationwide for IIT, the universities of Pakistan will also need to build more physical campuses. To solve for limited seats on campus, they would also need to introduce their own massive open online courses similar to MIT, edX, and Coursera.\nReforms will be required to ensure more children go to school as will support for initiatives such as the Orange Tree Foundation and The Citizens Foundation, which support college-going and pre-college students respectively. In solving the global STEM talent crunch, Pakistan will enable it\u2019s own economic empowerment and uplift the underserved communities.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan is a country with a rich cultural heritage and a diverse population. Despite the progress made in recent years, women in Pakistan continue to face significant challenges, particularly in the workplace. The country has one of the lowest rates of female entrepreneurship in the world, with only one per cent of women owning a business as opposed to 21 per cent of men who are business owners, that too working in informal sector (MSMEs).\nHowever, the recent years have seen a growth in the number of women entrepreneurs in Pakistan who are working to change the narrative. Defying cultural norms and societal pressures these women have created successful businesses that cater to the unique needs of women in Pakistan.\nOne of the key drivers of this movement is the rise of female-led start-ups built for women in Pakistan. These start-ups are founded and run by women, with the primary goal of addressing the specific challenges and needs faced by women in the country.\nThese female-led startups also create employment opportunities and drive economic growth in the country. By providing women with the tools and resources they need to succeed, these businesses are challenging gender norms and empowering women to take charge of their lives and careers.\nA report by Invest2Innovate indicates that there is a significant gender gap in the start-up ecosystem. Only 1.4% of all investments over the past seven years have gone towards women-led startups. This disparity may be partly due to the fact that married women face the challenge of managing both their household responsibilities and their business ventures, causing them to drop out of the workforce and avoid long working hours outside of the home.\nMany women also report a lack of support from their families when it comes to pursuing business opportunities. Additionally, women entrepreneurs often struggle to secure startup capital, receive proper guidance and counseling, open separate bank accounts, access finance for business growth, and obtain financial information related to their business. The distribution of loans by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) also reflects a gender gap, with only three per cent of small-medium business loans and 19% of microfinance loans being awarded to women, while the majority of these loans go to men.\nGiven this backdrop, the rise of female-led startups built for women is a sign of progress and a cause for hope. There are multiple startups that have been created for women by women, including women-specific services which aid and protect them in their daily life.\n\nThe self-defence method\nInsiya Meherally is the founder and CEO of The Method, an award-winning self- defense training organization that is focused on women. After graduating from Canada\u2019s top business school, she spent three years heading the communications department at InsurTech lab, headquartered in downtown Toronto. Since 2021, she has been working to make The Method\u2019s flagship training accessible.\nThe incident at Minar-e-Pakistan in August 2021 inspired Insiya to search for self-defense training that is catered to women's everyday safety issues. However, she found that the existing solutions in Karachi were not entirely accessible or affordable to the average Pakistani woman. This is where Insiya saw an opportunity to make a difference.\nIn 2021, Insiya connected with a trainer in Lahore, Dr Haiqa Nasir, who had spent years perfecting her holistic self-defense workshops. \u201cWe clicked instantly,\" says Insiya. \"Over the past year, we\u2019ve trained 700 plus individuals together at organizations across Pakistan, including Procter & Gamble, Shell, and Engro Corp,\u201d she says.\nThere were several challenges along the way, but passion and determination enabled Insiya to create something truly unique and powerful.\nIn December 2021, Insiya launched The Method's flagship self defense training in collaboration with District 19. Everything was carefully researched and prepared, and they took their time to perfect the event structure before they settled on the date. Insiya says, \"We've been collecting feedback and staying connected to our audience since Day 1, all in an effort to continuously enhance our content and participant experience as we grow.\"\nInsiya believes public events are a great way to immerse their audience in the experience they've designed. Whether they run a workshop at a festival or speak on a panel at a Women's Day event, they are constantly representing their startup and providing a taste of the value they deliver.\n\nInsiya is also grateful to Shell Tameer for its role in the success of her startup. By the time they pitched at Shell Tameer, they were almost a year old and had already trained over 450 individuals. Insiya also found the Shell Tameer Awards 2022 event to be a great opportunity to plug into the greater startup ecosystem and meet other founders doing incredible work in Pakistan.\nInsiya's startup has achieved great success, and she has received humbling feedback from her customers. She said, \"I was recently having coffee with a friend whom I had met through one of our workshops in early 2022. Halfway through the conversation, she began to share how the training had increased her confidence and how she still remembers the content clearly, even a year later. I am often blown away by this type of feedback and I feel so humbled that we\u2019ve been blessed with this degree of impact!\"\nInsiya has managed to balance her personal life and her role as an entrepreneur with the help of her community. She says, \"Behind every successful venture, you\u2019ll often find incredible community support.\"\nSheKab your ride to work\nA ride-hailing service for women in Pakistan, SheKab was founded by Hira Batool Rizvi in 2015, after she witnessed firsthand the difficulties women faced in commuting to work safely. It is providing transportation solutions exclusively for women. The startup aims to empower women by providing them with safe and reliable transportation options, which is a significant challenge for women in Pakistan due to cultural and social norms that limit their mobility.\nSheKab allows women to share rides with other women going to the same destination. The platform ensures that all drivers are verified and trained, and that the vehicles are safe and comfortable. By providing safe and reliable transportation options for women, SheKab is helping to increase women's mobility and independence, which can have a significant impact on their personal and professional lives. Women can now travel to work, attend meetings and events, and pursue their education without having to worry about safety or transportation challenges.\nIn addition to its transportation services, SheKab is also empowering women by providing employment opportunities for female drivers. The startup is working to break gender barriers in a traditionally male-dominated field of driving and is providing training and support to women who want to become professional drivers.\nSmartphones help smart women\nFor many women living in the rural areas of Pakistan, education and personal growth have long been elusive goals. Despite efforts to improve access to schooling and other opportunities, many still face significant barriers that prevent them from reaching their full potential. From limited resources and cultural attitudes to security concerns and inadequate infrastructure, there are numerous factors that contribute to the ongoing challenges these women face. To solve these issues with the use of technology, Maham Wareesha was inspired to create an innovative mobile application that could educate women in rural areas of Pakistan.\nShe realized that women in these areas often lacked the opportunity to learn and grow, and smartphones can be valuable tools for education and personal development. Her app Smart Women provides features such as self-defense techniques, learning-based mini-games, and online educational videos to empower women and promote gender equality. \u201cI am trying to solve the problem of illiteracy and lack of awareness among women in rural areas of Pakistan,\" says Maham. \"I have observed that women in these areas are not allowed to use smartphones. I believe that my startup can raise awareness about the productive and educational use of smartphones and provide equal opportunities for women in rural areas to succeed in modern society,\u201d she explains.\n\nWhile developing her startup, Maham faced several challenges, including lack of funding, technical expertise, cultural barriers, and user adoption. She explored various options, such as crowdfunding, grants, angel investors, and venture capitalists for funding. For technical expertise, she hired developers and also partnered with a tech company. To overcome cultural barriers, she worked with local community leaders to educate them about the benefits of her app and address any objections they may have. For user adoption, she focused on marketing and promotion, building a user-friendly interface, and continually updating and improving her app based on user feedback.\nMaham's startup received a significant boost when she was given a platform by Shell Tameer to present her startup to a panel of industry professionals. This allowed her to gain insightful feedback on her business plan, elevator pitch, and overall strategy. \u201cWith the support of Shell Tameer, I was able to network with other business owners, subject matter experts, and potential investors, which facilitated the formation of alliances and collaborations,\u201d she shares.\nSmart Women differentiates itself from other companies in the market by being the first of its kind mobile-based application that provides an experience to get awareness in a real-time environment. Its solution is entirely smartphone-based and works on augmented reality technology. Maham and her team have developed Smart Women in such a way that it can easily adopt any change in technology and work properly, making it a cost-efficient product.\nMaham shared that, \u201cThis product is based on futuristic technologies such as augmented reality. This technology is in an evolving phase and getting advanced with the passage of time.\u201d\nThe biggest achievement for Smart Women so far has been to create their Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and make it functional. They have tested it with a few users and are now ready to test it with a larger group of users.\nMaham has managed to balance her personal life and her role as an entrepreneur by establishing boundaries between work and personal time. Maham says, \u201cIn order to manage my life, I have set both my working and personal hours. As I am the startup's founder I am constantly under guidance of our senior project team members, I assembled a strong team to handle all the challenges and to make my life easier. To make sure that my team was sincere, I worked as a sincere leader.\u201d\nMaham was fortunate to form her team into her family, and they genuinely assisted her in achieving her aim. She also ensures that her company culture promotes diversity and inclusion by trying her best to have the maximum number of women in the team.\nMaham's advice to other women interested in starting their own businesses is to focus on their mission, build a strong team, and address the challenges that arise. She encourages women to persevere, be creative, and adapt to changing circumstances. Additionally, Maham advises women to maintain a healthy work-life balance, establish boundaries between work and personal time, and seek support from friends, family, or a professional network to manage stress and maintain emotional stability.\nKitchen prep with Kati Katai \nKati Katai, founded by Romesa Aqeel, is a Pakistani startup that is revolutionizing the way women in the country access fresh fruits and vegetables. The startup supplies pre-cut fruits and vegetables through its online platform, making it easier for women to prepare healthy meals for their families while saving time and effort.\nThe idea for Kati Katai came to Romesa when she realized that many women in Pakistan struggle to prepare healthy meals due to the time and effort required to cut and prepare fresh produce. This often leads to unhealthy eating habits and a lack of access to essential vitamins and nutrients. Kati Katai aims to address this problem by making it easier and more convenient for women to access fresh fruits and vegetables.\nThrough its online platform, Kati Katai offers a variety of pre-cut fruits and vegetables, including onions, potatoes, tomatoes, and more. Customers can place their orders online and have them delivered directly to their doorstep, saving them the time and effort required to visit the local market and cut the produce themselves.\nOne of the key benefits of Kati Katai is that it is providing employment opportunities for women in Pakistan. Kati Katai is also promoting healthy eating habits among its customers by making it easier and more convenient for women to access fresh fruits and vegetables. In this way, the startup is helping to address the problem of malnutrition and other health issues that are prevalent in Pakistan.\nKati Katai has already received recognition for its innovative approach to promoting healthy eating and women's empowerment in Pakistan. The success of Kati Katai is a testament to the growing movement of women entrepreneurs in Pakistan who are providing innovative solutions that cater to the needs of women startups and helping to create a more inclusive and equitable society in Pakistan.\n"

Clashes between his supporters and the security forces have brought a new round of political chaos to Pakistan, which is in the midst of a crippling economic crisis.\nPolice in both Lahore and Islamabad confirmed the raids and the arrest of PTI workers they said were involved in clashes with police and arson. \"Police are raiding the houses because seven cases on various charges, including terrorism, have been registered against the leaders and workers,\" Lahore police chief Bilal Kamiana said referring to the clashes with police.\nRead More Crackdown on PTI: Islamabad police raid residence of Shibli Faraz\nHe said 125 activists had been arrested in Lahore, including some last week.

            "Text": "\u00a0\nThe Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday made it clear that if PTI Chairman Imran Khan seeks relief in terrorism cases filed against him, he must appear in court on Tuesday (today).\nA division bench, headed by Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, took up the former prime minister\u2019s plea seeking protective bail in two terrorism cases registered\u00a0against him in Islamabad following clashes at the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC) on Saturday.\nThe first information reports (FIRs) registered at the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) and the Golra Sharif police station stated that the PTI chief and party workers attacked the police and created unrest outside the FJC during the hearing of the Toshakhana case.\nAs proceedings commenced, Justice Rizvi asked Imran\u2019s counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, to confirm whether these were the petitioner\u2019s signatures or scanned ones. The counsel argued that these signatures were scanned and of the petitioner.\nThe counsel argued that two recent FIRs were registered against Imran and others as they reached Islamabad to attend the proceedings in a separate case.\nJustice Rizvi remarked, \u201cWhere is the petitioner?\u201d\nThe counsel replied he was not present but would appear by March 21 (Tuesday) and the case proceedings be adjourned.\nThe counsel said Imran was currently residing at his Zaman Park residence which was \u201csurrounded by police to effect the unlawful arrest\u201d. It was the petitioner\u2019s fundamental right that he be allowed to approach and personally appear before this court and a strict direction be issued to authorities to enable the petitioner to approach \u201cwithout any mischief by the police\u201d.\nJustice Rizvi remarked that if the petitioner wanted relief from the court he must be here in time (2:15pm), adding that any argument about the petitioner\u2019s coming or just reaching the court would not be entertained.\nMeanwhile, the division bench granted protective bails to PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi in two FIRs and Azam Swati in one till March 27. The FIRs were registered against them under different charges, including Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.\nSeparately, Islamabad District and Sessions Judge Zafar Iqbal has again summoned Imran on March 30 in the Toshakhana case. The court will hear arguments on the maintainability of the Election Commission of Pakistan complaint. However, the controversy regarding missing order sheet was resolved by the judge himself.\nOn Saturday, as it was impossible for Imran to enter the courtroom at the FJC due heavy tear-gas shelling, the judge had sent Islamabad Superintendent of Police Muhammad Sami Malik with Barrister Gohar to take \u00a0Imran's signature.\n\u201cI accompanied the counsel for taking Imran\u2019s signature but when I reached near his vehicle, Barrister Gohar Khan went ahead for taking the signature. [There was] heavy shelling of tear gas and stone pelting and I do not know about the missing order sheet,\u201d a statement submitted by the SP in court said.\nHowever, Barrister Gohar said in a statement: \u201cI got the signature of the accused on the gate of court premises when he was sitting in his vehicle and was unable to reach the courtroom due to heavy shelling of tear gas. There is no justification for concealing/missing of the order sheet by me and I handed it over to Dr Muhammad Sami Malik, SP Islamabad Police.\u201d\n"

Providing the salaries of any department on time is the responsibility of the departmental accounts office.\nThe officials in charge of the education office (female) have said that the SDEO (female) of Ghazi was transferred on February 18. \u201cHer post was still vacant and the temporary charge of handling the issues of salaries etc.\nHas not been handed over to anyone yet due to which seven months\u2019 salary cheques of the nine newly appointed primary teachers of Ghazi are still pending,\u201d they explained. \u201cAs soon as an officer is appointed, the checks will be released with her signature,\u201d they said.\nDozens of female teachers have been suffering from severe mental anguish due to the non-issuance of their salaries for the past seven months.\nOn being contacted about this situation, Mumtaz Khan, Budget and Accounts Officer of the Department of Education, said that male and female SDOs in Ghazi were appointed two days ago. \u201cAs per the rules and regulations, only an authorised officer is allowed to sign the released salary cheques. Due to non-placement, there has been a delay in releasing salaries, taking notice of which the required placement has been made in Ghazi. Now all teachers\u2019 salaries will be released soon,\u201d he claimed.\nMeanwhile, political leader Imran Alizai said that due to undue political interference, male and female offices of the education department had become political arenas.\n\u201cIncompetent persons with political backing have been illegally appointed to higher positions which will plague this department like the TMA has been with political vendettas,\u201d he said.\nHe alleged that it was unfortunate for the district that the appointment and transfer of school principals of grades 17 and 18 were being done by the class four secretary of a local politician who was himself a watchman or a driver.\n\u201cDue to this lawlessness, dozens of teachers cannot come forward for fear of reprisals. There are numerous instances where scores of male and female teachers have been targeted in the name of bogus inquiries,\u201d he claimed.\n\u00a0\n"

Provision of 302 (murder case) has also been included in the case filed after the autopsy of Iftikhar Ali\u2019s body, police said.\nThe body of Iftikhar Ali, a resident of Jaranwala, was handed over to the heirs after a post-mortem on Sunday.\nEarlier, the Punjab Human Organ Transplant Authority (PHOTA) and Rawalpindi police raided a private hospital involved in illegal organ transplants of patients and arrested nine suspects including three doctors for their alleged involvement in illegal transplants.\nAccording to police, a 65-year-old man, Iftikhar Ali, died while being operated upon during the illegal transplant while one person was shifted to a hospital in critical condition.\nThe police said that Dr Zahid was arrested in the past for his involvement in illegal organ transplantation and kidney sale.\nPolice also seized Rs20 million in cash from the private hospital and rounded up 15 patients, including a foreigner.\nPHOTA Assistant Director (technical) Faraz Ahmed earlier said that the private hospital was raided on a tip-off that illegal transplants were being carried out there.\nHe said that 15 patients were recovered from the hospital and of them, two were in critical condition. He said that all the patients were transferred to government hospitals.\nThe accused used to carry out kidney transplants illegally and earn millions of rupees. They used to buy kidneys from the poor for Rs0.1 million and sell them for up to Rs5 million.\nEarlier, Rawalpindi police arrested three suspected traffickers including two nurses from the Jand area.\nThe Rawat police arrested a man and two nurses who were allegedly involved in the illegal organ trade and transplantation of kidneys.\nPolice had recovered surgical equipment and a vehicle during a raid on two houses in a private housing society located in the vicinity of Rawat.\nThe two houses in the housing society were being used for the illegal organ trade. Police said that the houses had been by rented the accused for carrying out the illegal organ trade.\nPolice earlier said that the suspected two women had escaped the location leaving behind surgical equipment and other belongings including a vehicle after the police arrested one of their accomplices.\nPolice said that raids were underway for the arrest of the doctor, identified as Imran, who is said to be the ringleader of illegal kidney transplantation. The doctor is said to have fled to Lahore after the police arrested his accomplices.\nPakistan has long been an international hub for the illegal kidney trade, but authorities have been unable to act against the practice due to ineffective enforcement policies and a lack of political will to crack down. In Pakistan, organ donation is legal so long as it is voluntary, given without duress or the exchange of money. The limited supply sees the wealthy routinely exploit thousands of poor with the help of an organ trade mafia.\n"

            "Text": "As the government grapples with burgeoning public expenditure amidst a deepening financial crisis, a delay in funding for dengue prevention risks instigating a health crisis.\nAccording to the Dengue Control Manager, Dr. Qasim Afridi, the government has delayed transferring funds worth Rs350 million for the prevention and awareness campaign for dengue.\nThis comes as a bolt out of the blue for the health authorities who were expecting further assistance from the government following the recent rise in cases of dengue fever.\n\u201cDengue cases usually peak during the months of April and May in K-P, however 10 have already been reported just at the beginning of March,\u201d said a source from the Health Department.\nWhile dengue fever poses a threat to the health and safety of all citizens, those residing in areas like Peshawar, Mardan, Haripur, Khyber and Nowshera face a doubled threat given the topography of the regions where standing bodies of glacial water act as breeding grounds for the larvae of the dengue mosquitos.\nTherefore, in case preventative measures are not taken beforehand for eliminating the larvae in these regions, the virus risks spreading into other nearby areas.\nAs Ali Khan, a local from the Palosai area of Peshawar confirmed, \u201cA majority of the dengue cases reported from K-P originated in our locality. Why does the government not take the matter seriously,\u201d he questioned.\nThe direness of the situation is evident in the fact that up to 23,000 dengue cases including 18 deaths were reported in K-P last year.\nWhile Dr. Afridi asserts that the healthcare system in K-P is equipped to deal with a dengue epidemic, he still stresses the importance of preventing an outbreak in the first place, since once the disease becomes endemic, it can trigger a crisis beyond the countering capabilities of the hospitals.\nTherefore, in order to actualize the preventative goals, the Larva Surveillance campaign had been initiated across the province from January 2023 onwards, with weekly meetings being held involving the Deputy Commissioner and District Health Officer,\u201d said Dr Afridi.\nIn these campaigns locals were educated on the ways in which dengue can be prevented, especially with regards to the usage of mosquito nets and repellants. On a similar note, fogging and spraying was carried out on a large scale to destroy the larva in stagnant water.\nFollowing the government\u2019s inability to deliver funds on time, the Larva Surveillance Campaign had to utilize last year\u2019s funds worth Rs104 million.\n\u201cWhile our teams are educating the general public to the best of our abilities, the government must realize its duties towards the people and must invest in their well-being by transferring the allocated funds in a timely manner,\u201d concluded Dr Afridi.\n"

And now I think we can say that in pursuit of peace, we can look to China,\u201d Wang said, sharing the details of the \u2018seismic\u2019 deal.\nThe Wang\u2019s statement came as a number of countries in the region, including Pakistan, welcomed Iran and Saudi Arabia\u2019s move to re-establish their diplomatic relations under Chinese auspices after a seven-year gap.\nThe two regional heavyweights announced the Chinese-brokered deal on March 10 to restore ties which were severed after Iranian protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in 2016 following the Saudi execution of cleric Nimr al-Nimr.\nUnder the deal Iran and Saudi Arabia would reopen their embassies and missions within two months and implement security and economic cooperation deals signed more than 20 years ago.\nIranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Sunday that the two countries had agreed to hold a meeting between their top diplomats, while President Ebrahim Raisi also received an invitation from King Salman to visit the kingdom.\nThe deal is being seen as a historic strategic agreement, reflecting major changes on the world stage that could potentially change the face of regional politics \u2013 long considered to be the doing of the US, the architect of major geopolitical configurations.\nCommenting on the reactions pouring in from around the world, Wang noted that \u201cthe major good news\u201d had come as a sigh of relief for the people long bearing the brunt of regional chaos and tensions.\nHe added that the d\u00e9tente could only be realised due to the genuine willingness on the part of countries concerned. He acknowledged that all countries, regardless of their geopolitical locations, have hailed the development in unison.\n\u201cWe saw a genuine smile on Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister\u2019s [Bilawal Bhutto Zardari] face while he was welcoming the agreement,\u201d he added, referring to Pakistan\u2019s positive reaction to the news.\n\u2018No selfish interests\u2019\nThe remedying of the long-festering rifts has laid out a pattern for other countries to follow the suit and also hammer out peace agreements through dialogue \u201cbecause many hostilities in the region are intertwined\u201d.\nWhile highlighting China\u2019s emergence as a reliable mediator, Wang dismissed the notion that selfish geopolitical interests underpinned Beijing\u2019s ambitions. \u201cWe do not seek any selfish interests or aim to fulfil the so-called vacuum.\u201d\nHowever, in response to a question, Wang underscored an important caveat: although the resumption of diplomatic ties had opened up many doors and Beijing was willing to play a constructive role, it was not a skeleton key for all problems in a world.\n\u201cMake no mistake. One dialogue cannot solve all problems. We have noted that the sides have expressed their willingness to improve their relations through dialogue and consultation,\u201d he reminded.\nIn the same breath, however, he reiterated that the success of the Beijing dialogue was a milestone as it sought to calm the turbulent waters of the region mired in conflicts. \u201cBoth sides are willing to work step by step as not all problems will see resolution overnight.\u201d\n\u201cIt fully illustrates that no matter how complex the problems and how acute the challenges are, as long as the dialogue is conducted on an equal footing, in the spirit of mutual respect, a mutually acceptable solution can surely be found,\u201d he remarked.\n\u201cThe dialogue sets an example for countries in the Middle East to resolve conflicts and differences and achieve good neighbourliness through dialogue and consultation. It also provides a major piece of good news for the current turbulent world,\u201d he reiterated.\nIn response to another question, Wang explained that the dialogue was also a success due to China\u2019s support for it and hoped that the agreement would sustain despite the fact that hostilities between the two nations were rooted in history.\n\u201cIt is always based on the willingness of the countries, instead of lecturing others,\u201d Wang clarified, emphasising that China was always willing to make efforts but did not interfere. \u201cWe have played our role, set a pattern for them.\u201d\nAsked whether the deal would have an impact on the global energy supply chain as well, Wang said that since both countries were resource-rich and were located at strategically important lands, the resumption of diplomatic would also help the global energy supply.\nExplaining why the US was unable to end the hostility, Wang said that the question should be put to the US itself. However, he emphasised that China established itself as a reliable mediator. \u201cSaudi Arabia should be asked as to why they trusted China.\u201d\nSince the deal brokered, a flurry of diplomatic activity took place between Iran \u2013 which is strongly at odds with Western governments over its nuclear activities \u2013 and the Arab countries on the other side of the Persian Gulf.\nIn Tehran, Mohammad Jamshidi, the Iranian president\u2019s deputy chief of staff for political affairs said in a tweet that President Ebrahim Raisi \u201chas favourably received an invitation\u201d from Saudi Arabia\u2019s King to visit the kingdom.\n\u201cIn a letter to President Raisi... the King of Saudi Arabia welcomed the deal between the two brotherly countries (and) invited him to Riyadh,\u201d he tweeted, adding that \u201cRaisi welcomed the invitation\u201d.\nForeign Minister Amir-Abdollahian told reporters that the two countries had agreed to hold a meeting between their top diplomats, adding that three locations for the talks had been suggested, without specifying which.\nAlso a top Iranian security official, Ali Shamkhani, held talks with United Arab Emirates (UAE) President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi on Thursday in yet another sign of the shifting relations in the region.\n"

            "Text": "PTI chief Imran Khan has accused the ruling Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition of trying to drive a wedge between his party and the armed forces, saying that the government was attempting to turn military against the former ruling party.\nThe former premier\u2019s remarks came during a press conference via video link in the wake of a country-wide crackdown on his party workers who recently clashed with the police during a heated stand-off and protests at the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC).\nImran also claimed that his court appearance in the Toshakhana case had been devised as a trap to bring him into the crosshairs of the same people who took an aim at his life in Wazirabad.\nHe alleged that \u2018unknown\u2019 people were stationed inside the complex who would have killed him had he not left the place on the advice of his companions, and questioned why the people in plain clothes were allowed inside the complex.\nHe called on Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial to take notice.\n\u201cIt was a trap and their presence there only meant to assassinate me; on this occasion, our lawyers were also subjected to torture inside the judicial complex,\u201d he said, adding that the manner in which police resorted to teargas shelling and throwing stones at his convoy, he feared that the \u2018unknown\u2019 people would have killed him.\nHe also pleaded with the CJP to hold hearings of all the cases against him through video link, saying there was a threat to his life and he was deliberately being lured to the courts to expose him in the open and subsequently assassinate him.\nThe PTI chief also asked the CJP if there was any surety for his security. \"Tell me who was there to protect me when I entered the judicial complex, as the three to four guards protecting me would have easily been pushed away\u201d.\nHe also urged the top judge to take notice of what was happening in the country as democracy and the Constitution were being attacked and nobody seemed to care about it.\nContinuing on the judicial complex incident, Imran said that they were collecting evidence and the proof would be sent to the United Nations Human Rights Council and the European Union. He also urged overseas Pakistanis to apprise the international community of how the human rights of his party workers were being violated by the incumbent government.\nThe PTI chief also took a dig at the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), saying that his opponents would not win elections at any cost, adding that seeing election results, their aim was to now kill him. He also accused them of creating polarisation in society by calling his party workers terrorists, saying such allegations will spread hatred and divide the nation.\nHe further accused the coalition rulers of making efforts to create a rift between PTI and the armed forces; they were trying their best to provoke the military against the PTI by highlighting campaigns on social media, but no one could control public reaction on social media. He added that \u201cthis country was mine and the armed forces were also mine\u201d.\nHe further claimed that these people were not interested in holding elections; even if I was sent to jail, these people would assassinate me there as well. \u201cThey were resorting to brutality against him and his party to protect their interests. The country\u2019s history did not witness such brutality as it did in the tenure of this government,\u201d he added.\nReferring to alleged difficulties in running election campaigns in Punjab, he accused the government of spoiling peace in the province and thus creating hurdles to delay the elections despite its date drawing near. \u201cThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had already announced the schedule for polls in the province, which were to be held on April 30,\u201d he said, adding that the authorities were reluctant to allow them to hold a public rally at Minar-e-Pakistan.\nTurning his guns towards Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz, Khan said the \u2018queen of liars\u2019 thinks as if Pakistan was her fiefdom. \u201cShe says that her father (former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif) was Nelson Mandela and he should be forgiven,\u201d he added.\nThe former premier also castigated caretaker Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi, saying they came to power just to ruin the PTI and questioned how he became a millionaire in a short period.\nHe also castigated Finance Minister Ishaq Dar for saying that the country\u2019s missile programme could not be harmed.\n\u201cI think the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was now talking about our nuclear programme. I had warned earlier that if our economy continues to deteriorate, it would compromise our national security and sovereignty since they all were interlinked. Hence, conduct free and transparent elections and the economy would revive automatically,\u201d he added.\n"

No one will accept the results of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u00a0[if held under political governments later this year],\u201d the interior minister said.\u00a0\n\u201cThis will increase uncertainty in the country.\u00a0Is that what you want?\u201d he continued, referring to demands by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan calling for elections in the two provinces.\u00a0\n\"We want elections to be held across the country simultaneously,\u201d the minister said, adding: \u201cWhenever the elections are held, the nation will reject you [PTI] with the power of the vote.\u201d\nRana Sanaullah, however, emphasised that the government would follow the decision of the Supreme Court and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)\u00a0regarding the elections.\nReferring to Saturday\u2019s situation at the Judicial Complex in Islamabad during the hearing of cases against Imran, the interior minister accused the PTI chief of attacking\u00a0the courts with his armed activists.\nRead more: Crackdown on PTI continues as\u00a0Islamabad police raid residence of Shibli Faraz\n\u201cThis was hooliganism. If this tradition is allowed to continue, any person will go to the courts with armed groups and trample the law,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIf Imran\u2019s attendance was to be marked outside the court, it could have easily been done on Canal Road or Toll Plaza,\u201d he remarked.\nIn further criticism of the PTI chairman, Sana said that Imran was constantly trying to mislead the nation with his \u201clies\u201d. He alleged that Imran was promoting a culture of incivility in politics, as he \u201cdoes nothing but blame\u00a0his political opponents\u201d.\nThe minister regretted that Imran uttered foul remarks about Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Chief Organiser Maryam Nawaz, who, he claimed, was \u201cboldly exposing his [Imran's] agenda and false allegations to mislead the masses\u201d.\n\u201cShe will continue to expose PTI's ugly face. Imran should tell the people where are those who incurred Rs50 billion loss to the national kitty. Tell the people\u00a0where Farah Gogi is,\u201d he said.\nHe said that that the signing of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agreement by Imran Khan\u00a0and then its violation by his government was a deep-rooted conspiracy to destabilise Pakistan, which would be foiled with the support of the people.\nHe clarified that, despite having valid search warrants, the police did not enter the family area of Imran's Lahore residence. He alo claimed that a senior police officer was manhandled as he was on official duty to comply with the court orders.\nHe added that illegal weapons\u00a0and petrol bombs had been seized and miscreants arrested from Zaman Park. \u201cImran Khan would have to answer why he had kept 100 armed terrorists at his residence,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\n"

Terming the resolution 'a historic step', he said that the it would be instrumental in forging strong and close relationships between the two sides and would help project soft power of Pakistan and the United States.\n\"The resolution provides a framework and a strong foundation for pursuing mutually-beneficial partnerships, both in public and private domains, in critical areas of trade, investment, education, environment, culture and people-to-people exchanges,\" the Pakistani envoy said.\nDuring his telephonic conversation, he said that the sister-province relations resolution would open up vistas of opportunities of cooperation between Pakistan and the United States in diverse areas.\nMughal said that he was working closely with the business community, industry and academia to forge strong partnerships between the two sides.\nHe said that he would soon be extending an invitation to the political and business leadership of Georgia to visit Pakistan to gain first-hand knowledge and explore business opportunities in the country.\nGeorgia is the 24th-largest in area and 8th most populous of the 50 United States. Inhabited by a population of around 11 million with a GDP of $580 billion, Georgia's trailing five-year GDP growth is ranked as 14th in the United States.

The body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where he was identified as Asif. The deceased received one gunshot in the head which proved fatal, as per doctors.\nAccording to preliminary investigation, personal enmity appears to be the motive behind the deadly shooting, though his relatives claim that Asif had no enmity. Asif, a father of four and resident of Surjani Town, worked as a painter. Police have found the mobile phone and wallet of the victim at the crime scene. Police registered a case and started investigations.\nIn another incident, a 35-year-old man, named Dawood, was fatally shot in the remits of Jackson police station. Chhipa volunteers shifted the body to the Civil Hospital. Jackson police station SHO Babar Hameed said that the victim was a trucker.\nAs per preliminary investigations, two men riding a motorcycle pulled up near Dawood and shot him twice in the chest before speeding away. The SHO speculated that the shooting could be the result of some personal enmity as the suspected killers neither spoke to Dawood nor touched his wallet and cell-phone.\nSabir Khan, 31, was shot dead near the new vegetable market on the highway in the jurisdiction of the SITE Super Highway police station.

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah was the chief guest on the occasion.\nA total of 777 students graduated from AKU's global campuses with diplomas and degrees in 19 fields, bringing the total number of diplomas and degrees awarded by the AKU to more than 19,000, including more than 4,500 in East Africa. In Pakistan, the School of Nursing and Midwifery graduated its 5,000th student. The students graduated in nursing, medicine, education and media and communications.\n\"Graduands, my wish today is that you will know the joy of planting hope in people's lives, of building bridges of understanding, of venturing into the uncharted waters where new knowledge is discovered,\" His Highness the Aga Khan said. \"May your futures be rich in challenges embraced and overcome.\"\nThe AKU dates its inception from the receipt of its charter from the government of Pakistan on March 16, 1983, making this its 40th anniversary week. Founder's Day is a new annual tradition at the AKU. On founder's day, the university reflects on the vision of His Highness the Aga Khan, celebrates AKU's impact and recognizes all those who are making the founding vision a reality: faculty, staff, donors, volunteers, students, alumni and partners.\nPrincess Zahra Aga Khan expressed her gratitude to the global university community for the \"magnificent gift\" of its support for AKU over the past four decades. \"As we mark its inaugural Founder's Day, its 40th anniversary and the graduation of the class of 2022, the AKU has never had more to celebrate,\" she said. \"I am deeply, deeply grateful to everyone who has made its journey possible.\"\nPresident Sulaiman Shahabuddin paid tribute to the prince and \"his vision of a university that reconciles loyalty to international standards with service to those in need, that prepares its students to use knowledge to identify and solve problems, that demonstrates that science is the property of no single culture, but of all humanity.\"\nWhile addressing the ceremony, the chief guest, Chief Minister Shah, said, \"I am glad to be able to take this opportunity to thank the members of the AKU community who came to the aid of their fellow citizens in their hour of need, whether as volunteers or as donors. The fact that so many AKU students participated in the university's flood response speaks highly of them and of the education that they have received here.\"\nAKU's 40th year will see the launch of several new academic programmes. In Pakistan, classes will begin at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. In East Africa, the university will begin offering a six-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery and a four-year Bachelor of Science in Nursing. In Kampala, Uganda, the university is building a new campus that will include a university hospital and academic centre.\nIn his message, the Aga Khan traced AKU's 40-year journey from 1983 to the present, calling the AKU a source of hope and expressing pride in its achievements and confidence in its future.\nIn his valedictory speech, Mian Arsam Haroon urged his classmates to \"transform into action the knowledge you have received in the halls of this university and honor the commitment of the village that raised you\".\n\u00a0\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "Pakistan\u2019s decades-old policies that give preferential access to state resources to a select few sectors and ensure strong government footprints have placed it among nations that have the lowest inclusive growth and low access to education and healthcare, endangering the unparalleled demographic dividends.\nA book of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), \u201cPromoting Inclusive Growth in the Middle East and North Africa: Challenges and Opportunities in a Post-Pandemic World\u201d, outlines the prevailing poor economic conditions in a part of the world to which Pakistan also belongs.\nThe countries that have the lowest inclusive growth scores are Yemen, Mauritania and Pakistan. They lag behind other countries in the private sector and financial inclusion the most.\nIn terms of access to education, Iran, Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Lebanon, and Pakistan rank below average for the rest of the world. Within the region, Mauritania, Pakistan and Yemen are the ones that most seem to struggle to provide basic health services to their residents.\nSo much so, less than 15% of the poorest population have bank accounts and less than 6% have bank loans in Mauritania, Pakistan and Yemen. Just across the border in Iran, about 92% of the poorest 40% of population have bank accounts, 21% borrowing from a financial institution and 84% of the population using internet.\nThese stark contrasts tell how exclusive economic growth has remained in the region, including Pakistan, which has faced many wars and insurgencies and the young unemployed population could become a fodder to these militant groups.\nBesides, the discontent population has tried to oust governments through the Arab Spring, forcing the key stakeholders to review their policies. The IMF, which often faces criticism for causing high unemployment and low economic growth through its fiscal stabilisation policies, has now triggered a debate about the interplay between inclusive and sustainable growth.\nThe global lender is poised to formally unveil its new set of policies in Marrakesh, the economic centre and home to mosques and gardens \u2013 during the October 2023 World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings.\nIn 2018, the IMF had organised a regional conference at the same venue. The participants were of the strong opinion that MENA countries needed to change their economic models, and indeed build a new social contract to create more jobs, lift growth, and ensure that the benefits of economic development accrue more broadly to their citizens.\nThe elite capture is probably more pronounced in Pakistan than many countries in the region, thanks to the rich-centric policies, which have also lately come on the radar of the IMF.\n\u201cThere is fundamentally great potential in Pakistan for raising economic growth and making it more inclusive,\u201d said Nathan Porter, IMF Mission Chief, last week during a seminar organised at the National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST) to discuss the future economic agenda.\nOver the past two decades, Pakistan\u2019s labour force participation has been low, and investment rate has been around 15% of GDP, which is well below the best performers of the region.\nThere is continuing reliance on policies that promote subsidies and preferential treatment to some sectors, which are not the solutions to the low human capital development and low investments in Pakistan, said Porter. \u201cWe need to think about a new approach,\u201d he added.\nMaking growth inclusive and tackling these challenges really comes about bridging Pakistan\u2019s labour force participation and investment rates over the next 10 years, the IMF mission chief said.\nPorter argued that reducing state footprints will create breathing room for the private sector and will also strengthen the business environment. The recent adoption of a new state-owned enterprises (SOE) law will improve governance and should help more efficient use of state resources, said the mission chief.\nHe also emphasised on reducing anti-export biases through tariff policies and export promotion schemes.\nDuring the recent policy dialogue under the $6.5 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF), the IMF pushed Pakistan towards taking steps that are necessary to end the monopoly of a few businesses on the state\u2019s resources.\nIt has minimised the difference between the policy rate and the export refinancing schemes\u2019 rates that once used to be too large to the benefit of a few industrialists.\nThe few business-centric economic policies have led to low inclusive growth and as a result employment in the country is less than 50% of the working-age population.\nSubsidies are not drivers of strong business development as these benefit a few and the limited resources are not going to the most productive sectors of the economy, said Porter. These subsidies are not helping in creating sustainable employment opportunities and sustainable exports, added the mission chief.\nPakistan should tap its female labour force, as there is only one woman and three men in the labour force. Many women are working in the agriculture sector without remuneration, he said.\nGender gap alone is costing Pakistan Rs500 billion annually and closing it can boost GDP by 30%, said Ayesha Javed, Deputy Secretary Budget of the Ministry of Finance. There is a young demographic dividend to be taken in the next couple of decades and the reforms done in the right way can help reduce poverty and inequality, advised the IMF mission chief.\nIn its book, the IMF stated that 10 years after the Arab Spring, the need to ensure more and fairer opportunities for all \u2013 and, in particular, opportunities for the young people, women, and entrepreneurs \u2013 remains a key priority for MENA countries.\nDemographic changes, evolving climate conditions, the impact of automation and artificial intelligence in job markets all pose new challenges to the longstanding issues of high unemployment and deep inequalities in the region.\nInclusive growth is gaining focus in the region but it does not mean that macroeconomic stability is no longer on the agenda, rather the IMF is moving towards inclusive growth in a stable macroeconomic environment, said Dr Ashfaque Hasan Khan, Principal of Social Sciences School and Humanities, NUST.\nKhan argued that there is a need for change in conventional policies of the IMF, as the policies that promote stabilisation today and growth later have to be changed to inclusive growth policies without compromising macroeconomic stability.\nNUST Professor Dr Athar Maqsood sought more clarity in the IMF-World Bank policies, citing examples from the past where the policies increased inefficiencies in the power sector and taxation system of Pakistan.\n\u201cIn a country where average growth rate is 3% and population growth is 2.5%, enough employment opportunities cannot be generated. We have the highest unemployment rate and the demographic dividend has turned into a demographic disaster,\u201d said Maqsood.\nThe writer is a staff correspondent\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 20th, 2023.\n"

The meat meant for birds\u2019 consumption is being sold openly in the areas of Canal Road, some areas along the Ravi, Thokar Niaz Baig and blocks of GT Road.\nNo wonder, then, that these areas become the hub where eagles and crows hover in large numbers in search of food, and when they spot it they land on it, leaving the motorcyclists threatened by their movement.\nThe more the meat is left in these areas the larger the number of eagles and crows that hover in these places and consequently greater the nuisance for the general public and, especially, the motorcyclists.\nAyeza Haider, a wildlife activist, said that the sellers of meat meant for eagles\u2019 consumption put the stuff in red plastic bags.\nThe colour red is especially chosen so that eagles could easily spot these bags.\nAyeza Haider said that this practice not only endangered the birds' lives, but it also increased the number of eagles hovering in those areas.\nA bloodthirsty eagle gliding towards the ground at full thrust could cause accidents involving human lives.\nThe focal person of The National Alliance of Animal Rights, Aneeza Khan Omer Zai, has sent photos and videos of bird sellers in different parts of the city to the district wildlife officer of Lahore.\nKhan has demanded of the government to take serious action against those selling birds after captivating them.\n"

He said that China had never challenged the US interests in the region in the past and had no intention to do so in the future. Since China was not aiming at replacing the US in the region, there would not be a power struggle between the two powers in the future, at least from the Chinese side, he added.\nOn implications of the recent agreement, Dr Khan said that the Saudi-Iran rapprochement would help defuse tensions in the region, particularly in Yemen. Commenting on China\u2019s mediatory role, he said it was not something new as China had centuries-old relations with the countries in the region, and it was just the renewal of old ties, he added.\n"

            "Text": "The caretaker government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) has contacted the Punjab government with a request to remove ban on the delivery of flour and all other obstacles immediately.\nThe caretaker government has also started implementation of the Ramazan package worth Rs19.77 billion for 36.8 million people registered under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) in the province, whereby 5.7 million households would be supplied 30kg flour each.\nApart from the establishment of more than 7,600 sale points, other points have also been set up at 1,600 Utility Stores from where flour can be obtained by showing the card.\nMinister for Food and Irrigation Fazl Elahi and Minister of Information Barrister Feroze Jamal Kakakhel, while addressing\u00a0a press conference at the food department, said that the prime minister announced the provision of free ration in Ramazan, in continuation of which the government is also starting the free ration programme.\n\u201cDue to floods and poverty, people are facing economic difficulties, and despite these difficulties, we are giving packages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe produced 1.3 million tonnes of wheat,\u201d he said.\nFood Minister Elahi said that this year, the government gave a subsidy of Rs35 billion to PASCO and bought wheat.\nDuring the month of Ramazan, from Rs19.77 billion, the government will give flour to 5.7 million families or 36.8 million people under BISP, and 7,600 sale points will be established, alongside 1,600 points at Utility Stores, he added.\nEvery eligible family will need to bring original identity card, those who are not registered in BISP can apply and get registered within 24 hours, he further said.\nThe food minister said that currently the subsidised supply has been stopped and the Ramazan package will be implemented.\nSubsidised flour supply will resume after Ramazan, he added.\nHe also asked philanthropists to help the poor and asked hoarders and those who sell things at expensive rates to change their behaviour. Secretary food said that flour will be given on BISP card.\n\u201cThis is a targeted subsidy. Every household will get it once, we will do full monitoring so that there is no problem,\u201d he added. \u201cThe federal government has provided BISP data and linked us with Utility Stores.\u201d\nThree bags of 10 kg will be given to the beneficiaries in a month, he said.\nThe secretary said that K-P procures 75 percent wheat from Punjab and other sources while it produces 25 percent itself.\nEarlier, there were some issues related to the availability of wheat flour last month. This had prompted Caretaker Minister for Communications and Works (C&W) Muhammad Ali Shah to order redressal of complaints related to flour distribution in the Malakand Division.\n"

Many road crashes involved barrels of oils which caught fire, burning the passengers alive.\nIn a recent meeting of the Apex Committee, chaired by Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo, several special measures were ordered regarding the owners and drivers of the passenger coaches, buses and wagons.\nThe owners and drivers of vehicles on the national highways, especially on the Quetta-Karachi highway, have been directed to ensure installation of trackers to check the speed of the vehicles to protect people\u2019s lives.\nThe Apex Committee also banned carrying petrol, diesel and other inflammable materials on the passenger vehicles. In this regard the district administrations were ordered to ensure strict implementation of these measures.\nActing on the decisions, Balochistan Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz Uqailli directed the commissioners, deputy commissioners and provincial transport authority to check the speed of passenger vehicles and take legal actions in case of any violations.\n"

The USGS said that the tremors were also felt in Afghanistan and India for 30 seconds.\nReports from different parts of the country said tremors were felt in several cities, including Islamabad, Peshawar, Charsadda, Lahore, and Rawalpindi. After the earthquake, frightened people fled their homes and came out in the open.\n\u201cPeople ran out of their houses and were reciting the Quran,\u201d said an AFP correspondent in Rawalpindi. Ikhlaq Kazmi, a retired professor, said his entire house shook. \u201cThe children started shouting that there is an earthquake,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all ran out.\u201d\nAt least 180 people, who suffered minor injuries, were taken to hospitals across the K-P, Shahidullah Khan, a senior government official, told AFP. K-P\u2019s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) confirmed two fatalities in the province.\nPolice officer Shafiullah Gandapur in Swat said that a 13-year-old girl died when a wall of her house collapsed, while 150 people were injured across the district.\nHe added that emergency had been declared at the hospitals in the district.\nOther reports from the province said that at least five members of a family were injured after the roof of their house collapsed in Swabi and 29 people, including women and children, were injured in Malakand divison and other areas.\nThe PDMA in Punjab said that more than 18 districts were jolted but no loss of life was reported. However, a PDMA spokesperson said that cracks had appeared in some high-rise buildings in Rawalpindi.\n\u201cRescue teams have been dispatched to evacuate the affected buildings,\u201d the spokesperson said, adding that orders had been issued to the administrations across Punjab to check other high-rise buildings for any damage.\nTremors were felt in Manjhipur, Dera Allahyar and Jafarabad areas of Balochistan, PDMA said. It put the administrations on alert and directed for taking precautionary measures in all hospitals to deal with any emergency.\nIn the Azad Jammu and Kashmir capital of Muzaffarabad \u2013 the site of a deadly earthquake in 2005 that killed more than 80,000 people \u2013 people ran out of their homes, crying and reciting holy verses, according to a Reuters report.\nA statement from the Prime Minister\u2019s Office said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and other relevant institutions to stay alert to deal with any untoward situation.\nAn emergency has been declared in the hospitals of the federal capital, including the Islamabad Polyclinic and the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Hospital, officials said.\nAccording to the international seismological centre, apart from Pakistan, tremors were also felt in Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, China, Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan. Shaking was also felt as far as the Indian capital, New Delhi.\nThe European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said that the 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck northern Afghanistan, adding that the tremor was very deep, 194 kilometres, and its epicentre was in the Hindu Kush mountain range, near Badakhshan.\nTwo people, including a child, were killed in Laghman province of Afghanistan, Shafiullah Rahimi, spokesman for Afghanistan's Ministry of Natural Disaster Management, told AFP.\nIn Afghanistan, many families were out of their homes celebrating Nowruz, the Persian New Year, when the quake struck. \u201cI heard people screaming and yelling as they came out in the streets,\u201d said Masieh, who was outside with his family when the tremor hit.\n\u201cIt was a terrifying tremor. I had never felt such a tremor before in my life,\u201d Khatera, 50, a resident of Kabul, told AFP. \u201cNobody dares to go inside their homes,\u201d added Noor Mohammad Hanifi, a shopkeeper in the capital.\nAuthorities and aid workers said very strong shaking was felt in Badakhshan, close to the epicentre of the earthquake.

The first case involves two FIRs filed against him on terrorism charges, and the second case relates to two call-up notices issued to him by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) for different inquiries. The protective bails were granted by two division benches of the court, one led by Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and the other by Justice Baqar Ali Najafi.\n\u0686\u0626\u06cc\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0646

petition filed by Imran against breach of the terms of reference (ToRs) during the Zaman Park operation at his residence that the local police, provincial administration and PTI leadership had agreed upon.\nJustice Sheikh, while hearing another plea filed by PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry seeking details of the cases registered against Imran and other party leaders, sought the complete record from the federal law office along with an affidavit by March 22.\nThe judge also restrained authorities from taking any coercive measures against Imran and other leaders until the submission of the details to the court.\nAs the proceedings commenced, Imran\u2019s lawyers Azhar Siddique and Barrister Salman Safdar complained to the court about the police violating the ToRs after giving a commitment to the court.\nThey argued that the police had committed contempt of court by conducting an \u201cillegal\u201d operation at Imran\u2019s Zaman Park residence under the garb of a search warrant.\nThe PTI chief, appearing first before Justice Sheikh\u2019s court, took the rostrum and said he was hiding before reaching the LHC.\n\u0686\u0626\u06cc\u0631\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u062d\u0631\u06cc\u06a9

which was not familiar to anyone.\nImran, who was ousted from the post of the prime minister in April last year, complained that his wife was at home when police forcibly went inside by breaking the main gate and windows.\nHe added that the operation was carried out despite the police high-ups, local administration and PTI reaching an agreement on the ToRs.\nThe PTI chief maintained that the screaming of his family members could be heard on the CCTV cameras installed at his residence.\nHe expressed his astonishment that he was being restrained by police officials from heading towards courts so that he could acquire bail in the cases against him.\nOn a point, Justice Sheikh remarked that he would not spare those who were making a mockery of the judiciary on TV talk shows.\nThe lawyers also told the court that several cases had been registered against the PTI chief and other party leaders, but they were not being provided with their details.\nDuring the proceedings, Justice Sheikh directed Imran\u2019s private guards to leave the court, noting that the police officials present there were enough for his security.\nHowever, the assistant advocate general expressed his lack of trust in the court, requesting the judge to shift the matter to another one.\nThis irked Justice Sheikh, who asked which specific aspect he lacked confidence in, adding that the matter was already proceeding in his court.\nHe warned that he would initiate contempt proceedings if this conduct was repeated.\nJustice Sheikh remarked that the court had been issuing notices, seeking the record of the cases.\n\u201cToday is the era of WhatsApp. You can obtain the record through WhatsApp,\u201d he added.\nAfter that, Imran appeared before a division bench headed by Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, where he was granted protective bail until March 27 in two FIRs registered against him under different charges including Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).\nAs proceedings started, Imran\u2019s lawyer Barrister Salman Safdar told the court that the signatures on the petitions and other documents were scanned, but originally belonged to his client.\nTo this, Justice Rizvi directed the lawyer to acquire his client's original signatures on the petitions, affidavit and other related documents.\nWhen the lawyer told the bench about two protective bails in NAB-related matters, Justice Rizvi observed that this bench was not hearing matters pertaining to the anti-graft body.\nThose matters would be heard by the relevant bench, Justice Rizvi remarked.\nHowever, the bench granted Imran protective bails in two FIRs registered against him in Golra and CTD police stations in Islamabad.\nLater, Imran had to wait in the same court for the fixation of his pleas related to NAB\u2019s call-up notices to him.\nAs the PTI chief left for the other division bench, police officials intercepted his vehicle.\nThey did not allow him to move towards that courtroom along with his vehicle. Imran had to reach there on foot.\nThe PTI chief appeared before another division bench headed by Justice Najafi, where he had filed pleas for two protective bails \u2013 one in a NAB\u2019s call-up notice in response to an inquiry it had initiated for the \u201cmisuse of authority; criminal breach of trust; and illegal gain in selling gifted state assets\u201d and the second\u00a0 call-up notice issued by the anti-graft body in connection with its probe pertaining to \u201cmisuse of authority; financial gains and criminal breach of trust in recovery of crime proceeds received from the UK; and illegal sealing of its record\u201d.\nImran\u2019s lawyer Safdar told the court that an institution was already conducting an investigation and a trial was also underway.\nHowever, he added that all of a sudden, NAB also started an inquiry into the Toshakhana case.\nThe lawyer argued that it had become an uphill task for him to assist his client in the bulk of cases registered against him.\nHe told the court that this time, 97 cases had been registered against Imran and other party leaders.\nTo this, another lawyer representing the PTI chief Azhar Siddique told the court that his client was approaching his \u201cnon-cricketing\u201d century.\nThe lawyers argued that Imran wanted to appear before Islamabad\u2019s relevant court but a NAB team reached his Zaman Park residence every day.\nThe bench granted Imran protective bails till March 31.\nTaking the rostrum, Imran told the court that the elections were scheduled to take place on April 30, but his movement had been confined to the courts instead of him running his poll campaign.\nHe added that by attending court proceedings, there was no time left for him to distribute election tickets.\nThe PTI chief claimed that no FIR was registered against him for 50 years, but now 96 had been filed in the last six months.\nEarlier, as Imran\u2019s vehicle reached near the court of Justice Sheikh, a pistol was seen near it.\nAfter hue and cry, police officials took the pistol into their possession.\nLater, it was stated that perhaps it belonged to a police official and it fell down because of the crowd that had gathered at the scene.\nFurthermore, as Imran was sitting before Justice Rizvi, the lawyers present there suddenly started making noise, saying there was a device behind the doors of the courtroom.\nThe police officials took the device into their possession and confirmed that it was only a wireless set.\nLater, the officials said perhaps it belonged to a police officer.\nSeparately, the Islamabad High Court, while accepting the PTI chairman\u2019s request for exemption from appearance, extended his interim bail in an \u201cattempted murder\u201d case till April 6.\nThe state counsel told the court that Imran had not participated in the investigation yet despite the issuance of two notices.\nImran\u2019s lawyer Faisal Chaudhry told the IHC that his client was busy appearing before courts in Lahore and that was why he could not come to Islamabad.\nHe added that the investigating officer of the case thought that in-person recording of statement was necessary.\nChaudhry further said either the investigating officer could accompany him to Lahore for this purpose or Imran could record his statement when he arrived at the IHC.\nIHC Chief Justice Aamer Farooq directed Imran\u2019s lawyer to coordinate with the investigating officer on how Imran\u2019s statement would be recorded.\nPML-N leader Mohsin Ranjha had registered a case of \u201cattempted murder\u201d against the PTI chairman in October last year.\nHe filed the case against Imran a day after being attacked outside the Election Commission of Pakistan\u2019s (ECP) office in Islamabad, where PTI workers and supporters were protesting against the verdict of the commission, which disqualified the deposed premier in the Toshakhana case.\n"

            "Text": "A high-ranking Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) officer embraced martyrdom while seven others were injured, including two critically, in an encounter with terrorists in the northwestern region of the country on Tuesday.\nThe region has seen a resurgence of terrorist attacks since late last year, including a deadly bombing of a mosque in the city of Peshawar in which nearly 100 people, mostly policemen, were martyred.\nAccording to a statement issued by the military\u2019s media wing, Brigadier Mustafa Kamal Barki encountered hardcore terrorists in the Angoor Adda locality of South Waziristan, a mountainous region that borders Afghanistan and has long been a hotbed of militants.\nThe Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that Brigadier Barki and his team put up a valiant resistance against the terrorists during the encounter and the officer sacrificed his life for peace of the motherland.\n\u201cIntense firing was exchanged with terrorists and two of Brigadier Barki's team members are in critical condition.\u201d\nNo group has claimed responsibility. Most attacks in the region have been claimed by the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).\n\"[The] defence forces of Pakistan and intelligence agencies pledge to reaffirm and demonstrate firm resolve to eliminate the menace of terrorism from every inch of the country,\" it added.\nBrigadier Barki was instrumental in locating and eradicating terrorists responsible for vicious assaults in Pakistan, including the Army Public School (APS) attack in Peshawar.\nHe received his commission in the esteemed Frontier Force Regiment of Pakistan on October 12, 1995. The martyred officer is survived by his spouse, daughter, and son.\nThe nation mourns the loss of their fallen hero, as he is honoured for his bravery and sacrifice.\nPakistan's security forces have conducted numerous operations against terrorism across the country, not only arresting terrorists and their facilitators but also foiling several attacks during the last three months.\nBrigadier Barki is the second most high-ranking ISI official who embraced martyrdom.\nIn January, two ISI officials \u2014 Director Naveed Sadiq Sial and Inspector Nasir Abbas \u2014 were martyred in a gun attack at a roadside restaurant in the Pirowal area of Khanewal.\nA little-known terrorist group calling itself Lashkar-e-Khorasan had immediately claimed responsibility, but the TTP later claimed that the deadly attack was carried out by its \u201csecret squad\u201d.Separately, three soldiers of Pakistan Army embraced martyrdom when terrorists opened fire on a police check post in the general area Khutti in K-P\u2019s Dera Ismail Khan district, the ISPR said in a statement.\nAccording to the ISPR, the security forces immediately cordoned off the area and blocked all possible escape routes.\nIt said that the fleeing terrorists were intercepted in the Saggu area of the district. After an intense exchange of fire, three terrorists were killed, and weapons and ammunition were recovered from them.\nDuring the intense exchange of fire, 42-year-old Havaldar Muhammad Azhar Iqbal from Lodhran, 34-year-old Naik Muhammad Asad from Khanewal, and 22-year-old Sepoy Muhammad Essa from South Waziristan fought bravely but were martyred.\nThe ISPR added that the area is being sanitised to eliminate any remaining terrorists. \"Pakistan Army remains determined to eradicate terrorism, and the sacrifices of our brave soldiers strengthen our resolve,\" the statement said.\nSecurity forces have killed at least 142 terrorists during the last three months as operations to eliminate terrorism from the country continue. At least 1,007 terrorists were arrested during 6,921 operations by security forces across the country in the last three months.\nA total of 1,960 operations were conducted in K-P, of which 1,516 were area-domination operations, 301 were intelligence based operations, and 143 were area-sanitisation operations.\n"

            "Text": "An Afghan Taliban delegation, comprising intelligence and security officials, quietly visited Islamabad recently to discuss a way forward towards addressing Pakistan\u2019s concerns regarding the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), sources said on Monday.\nTaliban ranks in Kabul also confirmed that a mid-level delegation led by Abdullah Ghazanavi, the head of the General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI), travelled to Pakistan for discussion on the TTP and threats to Pakistan.\nThe sources said the visit was a follow-up of last month\u2019s trip to Kabul by a high-powered delegation led by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif.\nThe delegation received a briefing on the steps taken by the Afghan government to deal with the TTP.\nThe Pakistani delegation, however, deemed those steps unsatisfactory and sought concerted actions.\nPakistan also confronted the Afghan Taliban leadership with proofs about the whereabouts of the TTP leadership.\nDuring its stay in Islamabad, the sources said, the Afghan delegation met with the relevant authorities to discuss the security situation and the fate of the TTP and its affiliates.\nA source in Kabul with the knowledge of matter told The Express Tribune on the condition of anonymity that the delegation, comprising 10 members form the Taliban\u2019s GDI, visited Islamabad last week.\nThe delegation was also assisted by GDI official Muhammad Wardak, the source said, adding that the delegation was mandated to deliver a massage from Kabul that the concerns of Pakistan would be addressed.\nBoth sides stayed mum on the visit. The sources in Islamabad said that given the sensitivity of the issue, both sides decided to discuss such matters away from the media glare.\nThe source in Kabul revealed that both sides made progress on various issues, but he was not authorised to make public statements.\nThe TTP has become a thorny issue between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan expected the Afghan Taliban to address its concerns regarding the TTP after its return to power in August 2021. But contrary to the expectations, the TTP attacks only went up.\nThe Afghan Taliban\u2019s reluctance to take on the TTP stemmed from its fears that the group\u2019s fighters might join Da\u2019esh. Second, the Afghan Taliban and the TTP share the same ideology as they fought alongside the US-led foreign forces.\n"

            "Text": "The ruling coalition on Monday hinted at banning the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), as the government claimed the party had become a terrorist outfit after its involvement in attacking state institutions, including the army, the judiciary, and law-enforcement agencies.\nThe coalition government condemned the attacks carried out allegedly on the orders of PTI Chairman Imran Khan on police and Rangers, who were implementing court orders when they went to his Zaman Park residence in Lahore and when Imran came along with his supporters to a court in Islamabad the other day.\nThe Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led ruling alliance held a six-hour-long huddle with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in the chair. The meeting was attended by leaders of the coalition parties and federal ministers.\nAn official statement issued following the meeting stated that a joint session of parliament had been called on March 22 (tomorrow) for taking important decisions to ensure the writ of the state.\nThe meeting also strongly condemned a social media campaign being run from abroad against the state institutions, especially against Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Asim Munir, and asked the overseas Pakistanis not to be a part of this \u201csinister agenda\u201d.\nThe condemnation come hours after Prime Minister Shehbaz, in a tweet, accused Imran of \u201cdamaging the country and undermining our armed forces and their leadership\u201d and stressed the need for rejecting his political rival\u2019s \u201cagenda\u201d.\nShehbaz stressed that the \u201coverseas patriotic Pakistanis should raise their voice against the foreign-funded campaign,\u201d and cautioned them against the \u201cpoisonous politics\u201d in which they were being used as pawns.\n\u201cPTI\u2019s disgusting smear campaign against Chief of the Army Staff General Asim Munir at the behest of Imran Niazi is deserving of the strongest condemnation,\u201d Shehbaz tweeted.\nThe meeting decided that legal action would be taken against those running a dirty campaign from abroad against the martyrs of Lasbela last August. They said that this behaviour was unacceptable in any society and \u201cthis is not freedom of speech\u201d.\nThe alliance leaders expressed concerns over the treatment meted out to the PTI chairman by the courts, saying: \u201cThe treatment of Imran Khan and his colleagues is deepening the impression that the scales of justice are not equal\u201d. The official statement declared that \u201ctwo standards of justice in one country are not acceptable\u201d.\nAlso, the prime minister and other key members of the ruling alliance condemned an audio leak purportedly of a former chief justice of Pakistan and a PTI lawyer, saying that the vulgar conversation about PML-N Senior Vice President Maryam Nawaz Sharif in the leaked audio was alarming.\nIn the meeting, according to the official statement, the overall economic, political, internal and external law and order situation of the country was discussed in detail.\nThe meeting was apprised of the prime minister\u2019s initiates for the economy, restoration of the IMF programme, public relief, including Kisan package, free supply of flour to the poor families in Ramazan, subsidy on petrol price for people with low wages and income.\nIt was also given a briefing about the special discount schemes, conduct of the CSS special examination for the country\u2019s youth, promotion of solar energy, interest-free and subsidised loans for youth, rehabilitation of flood victims and other programmes.\nThe statement said that the meeting appreciated Shehbaz\u2019s efforts for restoring the economy and the IMF programme, while simultaneously providing maximum relief to the people despite the difficult conditions. The allied parties expressed full confidence in Prime Minister Shehbaz.\nWhile condemning the attacks and violence on police and Rangers on the order of Imran Khan, the huddle not only declared that it was unacceptable but said that attacking officers and employees of the state institutions by violent and trained groups with petrol bombs, sticks, guns, arms, was very alarming.\n\u201cThis behaviour is not at all constitutional, legal, democratic and political,\u201d the statement read. \u201cTaking up arms against the state, targeting its officers and men, firing at them, burning vehicles, besieging and ransacking court premises, looting, throwing police vehicles into canals and torturing the on-duty policemen is the height of lawlessness which no state can tolerate,\u201d the meeting declared.\nThe meeting expressed solidarity with the law-enforcement personnel and lauded their services. It declared that strict action should be taken against the law-breaking elements under the law and no leniency should be shown to them, adding: \u201cActions against the state cannot be tolerated.\u201d\nSubsequently, the meeting while referring to PTI workers clashes with the law-enforcers noted that the entire nation had seen that the PTI was not a political party but a group of trained militants of banned organisations. It said that evidences and proofs were available and it had been decided to take action in this regard according to the law.\nLater, talking to The Express Tribune, a senior official denied that the government was planning to file reference in Supreme Court for banning the PTI. He, however, added that only writ of state would be maintained at any cost.\nSenior lawyers believe that the process regarding the banning of a political party was so difficult as the government had to present evidences before the Supreme Court for justifying the ban.\nPM Shehbaz, federal ministers, Ishaq Dar, Khawaja Asif, Rana Sanaullah, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Ayaz Sadiq, Ahsan Iqbal, Naveed Qamar, Sherry Rehman, Chaudhry Salik as well as PML-N\u2019s Ata Tarar and Malik Ahmad Khan, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, PPP\u2019s Qamar Zaman Kaira, MQM-P\u2019s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Qaumi Watan Party\u2019s Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, National Democratic Movement\u2019s Mohsin Dawar, Awami National Party\u2019s Mian Iftikhar Hussain, Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan\u2019s Anas Norani, MNA Aslam Bhootani and others attended the meeting.\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "The chances of finalising the ninth review of the troubled $6.5 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) soon got bleak after the global lender on Monday raised questions over the government\u2019s new fuel subsidy scheme.\nThe development came as the government decided to dole out subsidies worth billions of rupees on petrol as well as Rs73 billion on wheat flour that could potentially lay landmines in the path of the Fund\u2019s programme.\nInstead of putting its house in order, the government announced Rs50 per liter subsidy for owners of up to 800cc cars and motorcyclists while Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab will give Rs73 billion in wheat flour subsidy cumulatively.\nSources in the finance ministry said that the global lender has inquired about the source of financing of the Prime Minister\u2019s petrol scheme. The IMF also asked about the mechanism in implementing the new subsidy programme, they added.\nIn her reaction, Esther Perez, the Resident Representative of the IMF, told The Express Tribune that the Pakistani \u201cauthorities did not consult with the IMF staff ahead of announcing their recent fuel subsidy proposal\u201d.\nShe added that the IMF staff was seeking \u201cgreater details on the scheme in terms of its operation, cost, targeting, protections against fraud and abuse, and offsetting measures, and will carefully discuss these elements with the authorities\u201d.\n\u201cAs a general matter, the IMF sees strengthening support for those eligible for social assistance through the unconditional Kafalat cash transfer scheme (BISP) as the most direct way to help the neediest in Pakistan,\u201d said Esther.\nThe federal government plans to collect Rs50 per liter extra from car owners of above 800cc category and give it to car owners of below 800cc and motorcyclists.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has the audacity to waive taxes of the richest commercial banks last month and also withdrew Rs3,000 per month tax on traders in September last year but wants to penalise middle-income group owning 1,000cc cars to fund his political scheme.\nThe IMF raised queries a day after the Prime Minister\u2019s Office announced to give Rs50 per liter subsidy to the 1.3 million owners of 800cc cars and over 20 million motorcyclists and rickshaw owners.\nThe move may jeopardise the IMF programme, if the government\u2019s explanation remained short of the Fund\u2019s expectations. The chances of an early IMF deal are already thin due to many political moves made by the government and its inability to raise $6 billion additional loans.\nWhile addressing a news conference on Monday, Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik said that the government will charge Rs100 more for petrol from the affluent so that relief could be provided to the low-income segments in fuel tariff.\nThe government considers an owner of 1,000cc car \u201caffluent\u201d but it does not have the guts to slap taxes on the richest landlords and retailers.\nWhile talking to The Express Tribune, Malik said that the owners of above 800cc cars will pay a higher price of Rs50 over and above the normal OGRA-determined petroleum products prices, which will be utilised to reduce the rate for the low-income consumers.\nThe per liter petrol price is Rs273, which will be increased to Rs323 at the current rates for the car owners of using above 800cc to help the PML-N and its allied parties to win the next general elections.\nDue to fears that PTI Chairman Imran Khan will clean sweep, the government is dragging its feet from holding the elections and has now placed its bets on the middle- and upper-middle income groups to lure votes from the lower-middle income groups through such schemes.\nIn the words of a senior PML-N party leader, the cross-fuel subsidy is a double-edged sword for the government.\nThe state minister explained that an escrow account will be opened with the National Bank of Pakistan and the dealers claims of subsidised fuel will be settled on a daily basis.\nHe added that the beneficiaries will be registered against the national identity card numbers who will receive a one-time-password to claim the cheaper fuel.\nA motorcyclist will receive a maximum 21 liter per month cheaper fuel with a daily cap of 3 liter while an 800cc car owner will get a maximum 30 liter per month of petrol, said Malik.\nThe petrol subsidy programme would be implemented within the next six weeks without any provision of subsidies being paid from the budget, said Malik.\nWheat flour subsidy\nOn the instructions of the Prime Minister, the two provinces have also rolled out a free wheat flour scheme in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. The sources said that the cumulative cost of the subsidy will be Rs73 billion per month in the two provinces.\nAn amount of Rs53 billion will be utilised in Punjab and another Rs19 billion will be needed in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa -- a province that is already in the red and cannot afford to give subsidies.\n\u201cThe Rs73 billion spending might jeopardise the recently agreed fiscal framework with the IMF, which requires Rs559 billion provincial cash surpluses,\u201d said the Finance Ministry sources.\nOn the basis of the Rs559 billion cash surplus, Rs465 billion or 0.5% primary budget deficit target had been agreed upon with the IMF just last month.\nThe sources said that K-P had informed the prime minister that it did not have the entire Rs19 billion funds to finance the free wheat flour scheme. The plan is to give free wheat flour to 5.7 million families in the province.\nAn official of the Punjab Finance Department said that the provincial government will honour its commitment given to the IMF. He said that although the maximum estimated cost is Rs53 billion, it may not go that high. He said currently the provincial government bears about Rs30 billion a month wheat flour subsidy.\nRecently, the untargeted subsidy has ended by increasing the released millers prices to the level of support price to end the general subsidy, he added.\nThe provincial government is paying Rs90 billion annual mark-up on the Rs575 billion debt taken for wheat operations in Punjab, which has become unsustainable. He said that the general wheat subsidy was financially unsustainable and will be removed and target subsidy will continue henceforth\n"

He recalled that the cotton farmers of Sindh sustained colossal financial losses last year due to the torrential rains and floods. He argued that a good price for the crop is also necessary to incentivize such farmers.\nHe informed that the provincial government is spending Rs8.5 billion to provide financial support specifically to the wheat farmers who are being paid Rs5,000 per acre support. In the first phase the farmers cultivating up to 12 acres of land will receive the support while in the second phase the farmers growing wheat on 12 to 25 acres will be covered, he added.\nWassan defended the provincial government\u2019s decision of paying Rs4,000 per maund to the wheat farmers for their crop, saying that the move will help to reduce reliance on the imported wheat which cost the country its depleting foreign exchange reserves.\nHe said the government has also increased the buying price of sugarcane to Rs450 while a minimum rate of Rs10,000 per maund for the cotton crop has also been recommended. According to him, 500 farmers are being given laser land levellers through the balloting.\nAgriculture Secretary Aijaz Ahmed Mahesar apprised that some 1,388 teams are collecting the data of the rain and flood affected farmers who will be compensated by the government.\n"

Reportedly, two suspects, Pervaiz Magsi and Abdullah Askani, have been identified as the main accused in this illegal trade.\nThe AVLC obtained records of stolen and snatched vehicles from Karachi, which were reportedly then handed over to Magsi and Askani. \nThe police obtained Close-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage and photos of the accused, who buy stolen cars from Karachi, particularly Toyota Corolla vehicles.\nAccording to details, Magsi is a native of Jhal Magsi and is also wanted for his involvement in buying stolen cars while Askani is from Lasbela district. The local network of the accused operates in Karachi, snatching or stealing vehicles from different areas of the city and delivering them to Balochistan where Magsi and Askani buy them at cheap prices.\nThe AVLC has obtained details of this gang in the past few days and some important arrests are also expected in the case. The police have formed a team to investigate car theft and expropriation groups from Karachi in the past years for identifying groups involved in selling vehicles from Karachi to Balochistan or other districts.\nAccording to the SSP AVLC, the gang sells the vehicles worth Rs 3.5 million for as little as Rs0.8 million to one million or even less to Magsi and Askani. The vehicles are then either used in Balochistan or their parts are taken out and sold in different markets.\nThree held in string of car break-ins \nThe Special Investigation Unit (SIU) claimed to have arrested three members, Naseem Khan, Khaista, Karim and Wazir Muhammad, of a gang who smashed vehicle windows in the parking areas to steal valuable goods. \nSIU police recovered weapons, a car and a laptop from the suspects arrested in a raid conducted on a tip-off provided by an informer.\nOne of the arrested suspects is Uzbek, while two are Afghan nationals, SSP Junaid Sheikh added that the suspects were illegally residing in the city. \n\u201cPolice have lodged 13 charges against the arrested suspect at different police stations as they are habitual criminals,\u201d he added. \nSSP Junaid further said that the arrested suspects would smash the windows of parked cars in lots of shops, restaurants, mosques, and hospitals to steal valuable goods. \nThe arrested suspects are currently under inquiry after being admitted to committing many crimes in different city areas.\n"

            "Text": "The demand for dates surges in the holy month of Ramazan because the faithful prefer to break their fast with dates as per the tradition of the Prophet (PBUH). \nHowever, this year the local dates crop was destroyed by the unprecedented floods in Sindh and Balochistan, while imports have also been hampered by depleting foreign exchange reserves in the country. \nTraders say high freight charges and depreciation of rupee have pushed up the price of imported dates by 30 to 40 per cent. \nThe Khajoor Bazaar in Karachi\u2019s Lea Market is the biggest trading centre of dates in the country, where traders complain about their predicament. They say that this year, the date crops in Khairpur district of Sindh, and Panjgur and Turbat districts of Balochistan were destroyed by the floods, while the available stocks would not suffice the demand. \nLike every year, prices of dates have increased with the advent of the fasting month.\nThe president of the Dates Traders and Retailers Association, Hanif Baloch, told The Express Tribune that Lea Market caters to the demand of not only Sindh, including Karachi, but it also supplies dates to the entire country. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a double whammy this season as the local date crops have been destroyed by the floods, while we cannot import dates due to non-availability of dollars in the market,\u201d he added. \u201cThis year, only Iranian dates are available in the market, which are imported through an arrangement with Iranian traders.\u201d \nHowever, the price of Iranian dates has also doubled. Last year, they were sold for Rs8,000 per 40kg, while this year the price has shot up to Rs15,000 to 17,000 per 40kg. \nDates Merchants Association President Muhammad Sabir added that the Iranian Zahidi dates were being sold for Rs12,000 to 14,000 per 40kg, while Iranian dry dates are available at Rs600 per kg and Panjgur dates are selling at Rs700 per kg at various superstores in Karachi.\nBesides religious importance, dates are one of the most popular fruits with a list of essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals, required for normal growth, development and overall well-being.\nKhajoor Bazaar abuzz with flies, business activity \nWhile traders, wholesalers and retailers squabble over rates, the largest centre for buying and selling dates in Karachi is buzzing with flies and business activity. Khajoor Bazaar in the Lea Market area is considered as one of the oldest markets in Karachi. Some locals say that the bazaar predate British rule. \nIt was close to the ancient jetty of Ghas Bandar (grass port) where seafarers brought dates from Arab countries on sail boats. Traders used to haul the delicacies from Karachi to other part of India.\nThe Ghas Bandar jetty is no more, but the date trade thrives. Dates from Sukkur, Khairpur, Panjgur, Iran, Iraq and Saudi Arabia are available here. Until two decades ago, center consisted of one to two main streets. However, the market has now shifted to new building compounds and shops across the street and wholesale business has taken a different turn. Dates are sold at retail on stalls in the old streets. There are also some wholesale centers in the area. The number of temporary shops increases during Ramazan. An estimated 50 to 60 tons of dates are sold daily in Lea Market\u2019s Khajoor Bazaar a few months before Ramazan, which is also supplied to other parts of the country.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 21st, 2023.\n"

            "Text": "Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that the schedule of by elections for local government released by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is unacceptable, and the Sindh government will immediately challenge the schedule in the Sindh High Court (SHC).\nAddressing the foundation laying ceremony of heart disease medical facility Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Cardiovascular Disease in Korangi, Bilawal said that the schedule of LG by-polls by the ECP is a joke.\nHe said that for the first time in history, the PPP had a clean sweep in local government elections in Hyderabad, while also emerging as the largest party in Karachi.\nBilawal questioned as to why PPP was not given its rightful chance to have its mayor in Karachi and Hyderabad. \u201cSome elements are finding it hard to digest that the mayor of Karachi will be of PPP,\u201d he said, adding that he was surprised that local bodies elections have been held in Sindh but the people are deprived of representation deliberately.\nHe brushed aside fears of adversaries and said PPP have stood up to people running the Thunder Squad in the city and the goons of the terrorist sitting outside the country.\nBilawal said that the medical facilities run under PPP-led government treats patients on the basis of humanity. \nThe National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD) should become a model for the entire nation in every province and if other provinces want it, Nadeem Qamar is ready to give it to them. People say that NICVD is the answer to what happened to devolution of departments to provinces under the 18th Amendment of the Constitution, he said.\nNICVD branches will be opened in other cities too, \u201cwe will provide free heart treatment facilities in other cities as well,\u201d Bilawal said adding that NICVD\u00a0 can compete with Europe or\u00a0 with any hospital in India.\nThe PPP chairman said that for the last 10 to 15 years, opposition forces have been engaged in character assassination of the party, but the performance of NICVD is an answer to all.\nWithout naming anyone, Bilawal said the \u2018opponents\u2019 should show an institution like NICVD in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. He urged the \u2018opponents\u2019 to leave the politics of extremism, bullying, hatred and division. If you are running your hateful politics today, you are doing yourself a disservice, he said.\nEarlier, PPP chairman performed the groundbreaking ceremony of the 1,200-bed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases at Korangi. \nThe ceremony was attended by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, Federal Health Minister Qadir Patel, Provincial Health Minister Dr. Azra Fazal Pechuho, Senator Nisar Khuhro, NICVD Executive Director Dr Nadeem Qamar, all the provincial ministers, diplomats, MPAs and PPP leaders and workers in a large number. \nThe new ZAB institute of cardiovascular disease stretches over an area of 40 acres, located just north of the intersection of Main Korangi Road with Shah Faisal Korangi Road. \nSpeaking on the occasion, the chief minister apprised the chairman about the new ZAB institute. \u201cThis state-of-the-art complex will comprise seven buildings, occupying a total area of 2.4 million square feet, will be equipped with the most advanced medical technology,\u201d he said.\nMurad said the institute would offer specialised cardiac medical services, including 16 major and minor operating rooms, 18 cardiac-cath labs, two MRI labs, four CT labs, and a range of imaging procedures. \nThe CM said that the hospital would boast the country\u2019s largest clinical and animal research facility, among other services. \nThe Pakistan Peoples Party prides itself on always recognizing healthcare as one of its major priorities, the chief minister said and added that\u00a0 Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto always urged the party to focus on education and on health. \u201cTaking her words as our mission, we have concentrated our efforts on these two sectors - health and education, and I am happy to say that our hard work is showing great results,\u201d he said.\n"

The Iranian side agreed to keep the tariffs unchanged for the existing Jakigur-Mand interconnection line until December 2024 and also agreed to bring the new tariffs for the Polan-Gabd electricity transmission line down to the range of Cents 8.4 to 12.4 per unit, which is in Pakistan\u2019s favour.\nAnalysts argue that the settlement of tariffs is a positive development that will make possible the operationalisation of the 220-kV Polan-Gabd transmission line.\nThe additional 100MW electricity will be supplied to the region via the line and will account for addressing the electricity issues of Gwadar for the next 5-10 years. \nBoth countries have completed transmission lines within their respective areas, with Pakistan completing a 29-kilometer transmission line within its territory.\nSources said that the Power Division has sought out federal cabinet\u2019s approval of the MoU signed between Pakistan and Iran. Presently, Pakistan is importing 104MW of electricity to Balochistan\u2019s bordering areas. With the addition of the 100MW, the total import of electricity will reach 204MW. Sources said Iran has also sought an update on an earlier understanding with Pakistan, according to which Iran will supply 5,000MW of electricity to Pakistan.\nThe article originally appeared on the China Economic Net\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 21st, 2023.\n"

If anyone engages in any activity against the police, they will receive a response that will make them remember it. Enough is enough; the state will enforce its order,\u201d he added.\nThe caretaker chief minister announced that the police had been given a free hand to maintain law and order in the province and the inspector general had been given complete authority to take decisions after reviewing the situation. \n\"The police and Rangers had arrived at the Zaman Park gate twice, but we were informed about the presence of weapons, so I sent both forces back. We do not want to disturb the situation, nor do we want any loss of life,\" he said. \nHe regretted that policemen had been beaten up while leaving after duty at night. \n\"I had been consoling the policemen for many days, exhorting them to be patient to avoid casualties. The Elite Force\u2019s vehicle was stopped at 1:30 am, weapons were taken away and the van was smashed and pushed into the canal. There are fences on the sides of the canal and it is not an easy task to push a van into the canal. It cannot be done by ordinary people. Some people are involved in terrorism there, and their pictures have been collected. People from outside Punjab are involved in these activities,\" he added. \nNaqvi stated that political parties did not engage in such actions, nor was vandalism a political activity. \u201cOrdinary political workers do not carry out such attacks. How long will the police endure, do their duty, be abused and even be thrashed? Imran Khan threatened the police even yesterday, and the IG and CCPO were named. The police cannot be allowed to be threatened openly,\u201d he said. \nThe caretaker chief minister said if someone did not trust the police, then the personnel providing security to him should be sent back. \u201cIt is not possible to provide security and then be abused. Security is not possible while beating the police every day. It will not happen that you abuse the police and they protect you.\u201d\nHe asserted that the personnel had stated that they had search warrants and related messages, but they did not receive a response. He said the police had not entered the residence. \n\u201cWe are not ready to pick up dead bodies and we do not want the situation to worsen,\u201d he said.\n"

            "Text": "Several rare valuable animals have reportedly died in a fire that broke out in the Changa Manga forest near Lahore.\nSources said hunters started a fire on Sunday in an attempt to flush out deer hiding in the forest, resulting in the death of at least five deer. The Punjab Wildlife department has denied any knowledge of the incident, while the office of the Punjab Forest and Wildlife secretary has ordered an inquiry under the PEDA Act.\nChanga Manga forest is a protected area where hunting is strictly prohibited, and many species of animals and birds are kept in enclosures or released into the open environment. However, the lack of new appointments to important administrative posts in Punjab Wildlife has led to a decrease in wildlife care, and incidents of illegal hunting are on the rise. Currently, the positions of Deputy Director Lahore, Assistant Director Lahore, and Sheikhupura are vacant, with the Deputy Director\u2019s seat having been vacant since March 10.\n"

He also expressed indignation over giving the beneficiaries later dates to collect the flour.\nHe warned that such behaviour was not acceptable. \nHe directed the officials concerned to provide flour to the eligible beneficiaries present in the centre during the same day.\nThe caretaker CM inspected the CNIC verification counters and assured the citizens of immediate solution to their problems. \u201cI am personally monitoring the package and the whole provincial administration has been activated to serve the beneficiaries,\u201d he said and added that there had been some problems in the beginning but he had issued orders to solve them.\nThe Punjab Information Technology Board and NADRA have been asked to improve the CNIC verification process, he said and added that the provincial ministers had also been directed to submit reports after visiting the distribution centres.\nAddressing a news conference separately, the caretaker chief minister said the supply of free flour had begun throughout Punjab and thousands of centres had been set up for the purpose.\nHe said about 100 million people from 15.8 million families would be given 30 kilogrammes of wheat flour free of charge during Ramazan in the province. Around 474 million flour bags will be distributed under the scheme.\n\u201cI appeal to people to show patience in case of a rush. All efforts are being made to provide flour to all the eligible citizens who come to the centres and in the next few days the rush will reduce and everyone will get flour as this package will continue throughout the holy month,\u201d he added.\n\u00a0\n"

The PTI has filed a contempt petition against him.\nHowever, uncertainty still remains as whether or not elections in Punjab will be held on April 30 as scheduled.\nThe executive authorities are reluctant to hold elections in both the provinces.\nThe federal government is giving excuses not to set aside nearly Rs60 billion needed for holding the elections -- and it is actually facing a shortage of funds in the current year.\nA government official said in case of a supplementary grant, parliament has to pass a bill -- an unlikely development in the prevailing situation.\nNow all eyes are on CJP Bandial as to whether or not he will compel the government to arrange the funds for the elections as well as provide them with security.\nThe PTI is willing to talk with political parties to hold the elections for the National and provincial assemblies on one date.\nRecently, PTI chief and deposed premier Imran Khan wrote two letters to CJP Bandial for taking notice of the issues related to civil liberties faced by him and other party leaders.\nWith the PTI leaders facing a tough time at the hands of the \u2018powerful circles\u2019, a debate has started whether or not CJP Bandial would give relief to the party in the next couple of months.\nJustice Bandial is himself facing internal challenges within the institution.\nFirst, the Supreme Court judges are divided on ideological lines.\nSecondly, audio leaks are being released to indulge a few SC judges.\nIt is witnessed that one section of the judiciary is facing immense pressure from both inside and outside after the release of their video and audio recordings.\nSuperior bars, wherein the Independent Lawyers Group is in majority, are also accusing the CJP of protecting one SC judge, who is facing allegations of \u201cfavouring\u201d the PTI.\nThe Professional Lawyers Group is silent in the prevailing situation. Although a few representatives of this group are backing the SC judge.\nAll matters related to the eligibility of Imran will ultimately land in the IHC.\nA debate has also started as how IHC CJ Farooq would deal with these matters.\nIn comparison with former IHC CJ Athar Minallah, the PTI is unable to acquire relief in matters related to civil liberties during Justice Farooq's tenure as the chief justice of the high court.\nHowever, a PTI lawyer said the party had managed to obtain some relief from the IHC in the last couple of weeks.\n\u201cThis is a positive development for the PTI,\u201d he added.\nThe PTI is also facing a difficult time because of the caretaker government of Punjab.\nThe party has so far to managed to acquire some relief from the LHC since the last one year.\n"

            "Text": "The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has rejected the Federal Investigation Agency\u2019s (FIA) plea to cancel the bail of PTI chief Imran Khan in the prohibited funding case.\nA two-member bench comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri conducted the hearing on the plea on Wednesday, reported Express News.\nThe court also rejected the request to cancel the bail of co-accused Tariq Shafi.\nThe FIA had filed an application in the IHC on Feb 28 against the banking court\u2019s decision to grant bail to the PTI chief and appealed the court to annul the decision as it was \u201cagainst the law\u201d.\nDuring the course of hearing, FIA Special Prosecutor Rizwan Abbasi argued that Imran Khan has not yet been interrogated by the agency in the case, asking the court to cancel his bail.\nIHC Chief Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani asked if money laundering allegations in the FIR were against Arif Naqvi and Imran Khan or Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was the recipients of the funds.\nThe FIA counsel said that Imran Khan in a recent interview admitted that he received funds for charity purposes but used them for political activities.\nJustice Kayani inquired that if the money was used by a political party then how it became personal belonging. The FIA lawyer said it was a crime to send charity money through someone else's foreign account.\nJustice Kayani asked the FIA counsel to submit the letter of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) that the investigation agency received during the investigation. \u201cYou did not include the employee of the State Bank in the investigation. Changing the name of a bank account is not a crime. Has State Bank taken any action to change the name or nature of account?\u201d the judge inquired.\nThe FIA lawyer replied that the relevant record of UBL bank is missing and a written response was sought from the SBP, which they have provided.\nThe court remarked that keeping records are the responsibility of the bank and PTI did not take them. \u201cDid Imran Khan sign the nature of account change form?\u201d the judge asked.\nThe FIA lawyer said that Younis Ali, Tariq Shafi and Sardar Azhar Tariq signed the form to change the nature of the account.\n\u201cThis is a white collar crime. We have to investigate a lot of things,\u201d he added.\nHowever, Justice Kayani pointed that nature of account had not been changed and added that the entire case comes under the ambit of the SBP.\n\u201cWhat is Imran Khan's relationship with Tariq Shafi? What money has Imran Khan been withdrawing? Who is the signatory of this account? This account belongs to Tehreek-e-Insaf, so the Committee of Tehreek-e-Insaf has to run it. How did Imran Khan become beneficiary?\u201d the judge inquired.\nFIA prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi replied that Imran Khan is the chairman of the party, hence he is the beneficiary.\nContempt case\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday directed concerned authorities to submit a security report over the law and order situation created during Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan's visit to the Federal Judicial Complex (FJC) last week.\nChief Justice (CJ) IHC Justice Aamer Farooq was presiding over a hearing in relation to a contempt of court petition filed against Imran Assistant Commissioner (AC) Abdullah Khan through his lawyer Rizwan Abbasi.\nIn his petition, AC Khan has maintained that Imran had been ordered by the court not to create a law and order situation, \"but he breached those orders\".\nThe AC said that the police had made security arrangements in accordance with court orders while PTI workers pelted stones at the police deployed outside the FJC, owing to which several law enforcement personnel sustained injuries.\nDuring the proceedings at the IHC today, the court ordered IG Islamabad and concerned authorities of the local administration to submit a report on the events of March 18.\nThe court adjourned proceedings until April 7 and also consolidated the case with an ongoing case being heard by the IHC probing into the missing Toshakhana case file.\nLast week, as the PTI chief had made his way to Justice Zafar Iqbal's court, police and Imran's supporters clashed for several hours.\nAmidst the chaos, Imran was allowed by the court to sign his documents from his vehicle parked outside the courtroom where his indictment was to be decided.\nThe ex-premier's chief of staff Shibli Faraz had taken the order sheet to get Imran's signature alongside SP Malik, however, upon his return, the file had been reported missing.\n"

These men would kill four to five policemen to provide a justification to the Punjab Police for retaliation. Subsequently, I would be killed in an encounter amid the mayhem,\u201d he said.\nHowever, he appealed to his workers and supporters to show restraint in case of a police crackdown. \u201cYou should not respond to police brutality and remain peaceful at all costs. \"The police would prompt you to become violent and use it as a pretext to come hard on us, but all the PTI supporters should not respond and allow the police to enter my home if they arrive with a new arrest warrant against me.\"\n\u00a0\u201cI am ready to be arrested, but I would not let my people die. I am not concerned about my possible arrest, but I am concerned about my workers. The judiciary should protect our rights,\u201d he said.\nHe reiterated that he was lucky to escape the assassination attempt in Islamabad during his visit to the Judicial Complex to attend a court hearing. He averred that the police tried to entice their supporter by throwing stones at them to create mayhem and set the stage to kill him. He claimed that he received information from inside the police that \u2018unknown\u2019 people disguised in uniforms of the Counter Terrorism Department were deputed at the place and they also told him about what was about to happen against him.\nRead\u00a0At least 316 PTI workers arrested as crackdown over FJC chaos continues\n\u201cAll the footage of close circuit TV was mysteriously removed from the Judicial Complex while the IG scolded the policemen for allowing me to leave the complex,\u201d he said, claiming that the IG was involved in the assassination attempt on him in Islamabad.\nKhan alleged that the government attacked his residence as if a terrorist was hiding there. He further claimed that his party workers were separated from the rally and were being arrested while the police pelted stones from the roof outside the court during his appearance at the Islamabad court. \u201cI was mentally prepared to be arrested in Islamabad,\u201d he added.\nKhan also accused the ruling coalition of trying to oust his PTI party from the elections, as they feared that their interests would be compromised if he returns the power. \u201cThe money they (the rulers) have stashed abroad was more than the money they were asking from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),\u201d he added.\nThe former premier said that the inept rulers were destabilising the country and were the least concerned about what happens in the country, as their interests lie abroad. Their only concern right now was looting the national wealth and hence, they want to remove him, he added.\nHe urged the people not to abandon the struggle for their rights even if he was killed; \u201cthe rulers would make all efforts to make you their slaves, treat you like animals and thus deny you of your right to freedom. Break the shackle of fear and reclaim your right to freedom. If the incumbent rulers continue to stay at the helm, then the masses would have no future in this country,\u201d he added.\n"

            "Text": "More than 10 million people, including children, living in flood-affected areas remained deprived of safe drinking water, the United Nation\u2019s agency for children warned on Tuesday, six months after the devastating floods ravaged parts of Pakistan.\nOn the eve of World Water Day, Unicef said in a new release that the floods damaged most of water systems in affected areas, forcing more than 5.4 million people, including 2.5 million children, to solely rely on contaminated water from ponds and wells.\n\u201cSix months after catastrophic floods \u2026 more than 10 million people, including children, living in flood-affected areas remain deprived of safe drinking water, leaving families with no alternative but to drink and use potentially disease-ridden water,\u201d it said.\nEven before the floods, the news release said, despite the country\u2019s drinking water supply system covering 92% of the population, only 36% of the water was considered safe for consumption.\n\u201cSafe drinking water is not a privilege, it is a basic human right,\u201d said Abdullah Fadil, the Unicef representative in Pakistan. \u201cYet, every day, millions of girls and boys in Pakistan are fighting a losing battle against preventable waterborne diseases and the consequential malnutrition,\u201d he continued.\n\u201cWe need the continued support of our donors to provide safe water, build toilets and deliver vital sanitation services to these children and families who need them the most,\u201d Fadil added.\nThe prolonged lack of safe drinking water and toilets, along with the continued proximity of vulnerable families to bodies of stagnant water are contributing to the widespread outbreaks of waterborne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, dengue, and malaria.\nAt the same time, open defecation has increased by more than 14% in the flood-affected regions. To make matters worse, the lack of proper toilets is disproportionally affecting children, adolescent girls and women who are at added risk of shame and harm.\nBesides, unsafe water and poor sanitation are key underlying causes of malnutrition. The associated diseases, such as diarrhoea, prevent children from getting the vital nutrients they need.\n\u201cMalnourished children are more susceptible to waterborne diseases due to already weakened immune system, which simply perpetuates a vicious cycle of malnutrition and infection,\u201d the news release warned.\nTragically, it added, one-third of all child deaths globally are attributable to malnutrition and half of all undernutrition cases were linked to infections caused by a lack of access to safe water, adequate sanitation and good hygiene.\n\u201cIn Pakistan, malnutrition is associated with half of all child deaths. In flood affected areas, more than 1.5 million boys and girls are already severely malnourished, and the numbers will only rise in the absence of safe water and proper sanitation.\u201d\nUnicef has been on the ground with partners since the first day of the climate-induced floods hit Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces. After the floods, Unicef has installed numerous hand-pumps and water storage facilities.\nIn the past six months, Unicef has also distributed hygiene kits to more than 1.3 million people besides supporting the rehabilitation and rebuilding of water supply facilities, benefiting over 450,000 people.\nAhead of World Water Day, Unicef called upon the government, donors and partners to urgently allocate resources to restore access to safe drinking water and toilets and invest in climate-resilient safe drinking water supply facilities.\n\u201cIt is imperative that the voices and the needs of children in Pakistan are prioritised at all costs and that children are placed at the heart of all post-flood recovery and resilience plans,\u201d said Fadil.\n"

However, the current Rawalpindi administration decided against the order of the high court and allowed the CDA to dump the capital\u2019s waste at the current dumping site.\nAfter the local administration allowed the CDA to dump the waste at Losar, around 120,000 residents of the area announced to file a contempt plea in the high court against the Rawalpindi deputy commissioner.\nThey announced to challenge the deputy commissioner\u2019s notification allowing the CDA to dump the capita\u2019s waste. Thoba, Bada Meera, Chhota Meera, Hari, Bhambli Meera and other villages are also located in the area.\nDue to the dumping of garbage at Losar, citizens were already suffering from cancer, skin diseases, tuberculosis, and throat, stomach, and eye irritation.\nThey said that the dumping of the capital\u2019s waste will further exacerbate ailments and put the locals at higher risk of catching diseases.\nThe construction of the new dumping ground for Islamabad will also lead to the shutting down of 15 brick kilns in Losar and nearby villages. Zigzag technology had been installed in these brick kilns at a cost of millions of rupees a year ago. The closure of these brick kilns will increase the prices of bricks and render thousands of workers jobless.\nMohammad Asif advocate and Imran Aziz said that on their petition, the high court had decided to remove the dumping ground from Losar and shift it to Mandra Road. They said that Islamabad is a separate district, so how can the garbage of the federal capital be dumped in Punjab?\nThey said that the deputy commissioner has illegally allowed the garbage of Islamabad to be dumped in Rawalpindi. They said that they have decided to challenge the decision in the high court.\n"

            "Text": "On the occasion of World Water Day keeping in view Pakistan ranking 23rd among the countries suffering from severe water shortage in the next decade and its fast-depleting water reserves, it has become inevitable to adopt austerity at the national level.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) has also declared the availability of water in accordance with the principles of hygiene and securing water reserves as extremely significant because every year more than five million people in the world suffer from diseases due to the use of contaminated water.\nGiven the rapid decline of the underground water levels in Pakistan and the increase in the need for water due to its growing population, it has become extremely necessary to protect the reservoirs, but also to use the seawater as well as the water from the rivers, which gets wasted by falling into the sea, for drinking after treatment.\nFurther, rainwater harvesting can be used for proper and economical use of water for bathing, and ablution in mosques and the same water can also be used for irrigation purposes.\nCurrently, water is being used through the wash basin to commode link in an awareness campaign for the correct and economical use of water in Japan, through which the water used in the wash basin can be reused in the commode.\nIn this regard, it is also important not to have leakages in the water supply network, not to overflow the overhead tank and to shut down the electric motor after running it to obtain water so that the electric motor does not keep running more than the requirement and the waste of electricity and water due to overflowing can be avoided.\nOn the occasion of World Water Day on March 22 [today], the WHO is convincing citizens and governments to use water carefully and economically.\nIn this context, it is very important to use underground water with a plan and to use sea and river water after treatment for drinking and other needs. The WHO has indicated that Pakistan is in 23rd place among those countries which will have a severe shortage of water in the next decade.\nAccording to the WHO, the countries in which there is a severe shortage of water include Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Arab Emirates, Palestine, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Oman, Kyrgyzstan and Iran.\nIn the awareness campaign regarding the lack of water reservoirs in these countries, citizens and responsible institutions are being convinced about the economical use of water, its importance and utility and preventing wastage.\nLike any other country, if the water situation is examined in the country\u2019s capital, where the central offices of the federal government and all related institutions are located, there is no long-term plan for water availability in Islamabad its twin city of Rawalpindi despite the increasing need for water among the growing population.\nAt present, apart from Rawal Dam and Khanpur Dam, which depend on rainwater, water supply through tube wells is feasible while the most important water supply project for Islamabad and Rawalpindi districts for over 100 years, the Ghazi Barotha Water Supply Project is still pending after being considered by many governments in the past.\nThe cost of the Ghazi Barotha project, which has suffered the longest delay, has now reached Rs90 billion. Its project concept-1 (PC-1) has been sent to the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), the executing agency of the project.\nIn the first phase of the project, 200 million gallons of water will be available per day of which 100 million gallons per day (MGD) of water is to be provided to the CDA, 50 MGD to the WASA and 50 MGD to the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board.\nThe cost of the project has been divided among the three institutions according to their water supply share, under which the CDA will be responsible to pay Rs45 billion and the WASA and RCB will pay Rs22.50 billion each. In the second and third phases of the project, the daily supply is to reach 300 million gallons per day, but the project is still pending.\n\u00a0\n"

foul language in speeches; disrespect for parliament; and long marches and protests from 2013-18 were aimed at creating anarchy in the country,\u201d he added.\nSanaullah alleged that elections were rigged and managed to bring Imran\u00a0 into power in 2018.\nHe claimed that Imran tried to sideline the opposition.\nThe minister maintained that Imran had rejected the offers of PML-N President (and now prime minister) Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, also the incumbent foreign minister, for cooperation to steer the country out of the challenges it was facing.\nHe claimed that Imran had used abusive language against opposition leaders during his term as the prime minister and victimised them.\nSanaullah recalled that the leadership of the PML-N including Shehbaz, Khawaja Asif, Saad Rafique, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and PPP Co-Chairperson Asif Ali Zardari and his sister Faryal Talpur were detained in jail.\nHe added that Mirza Shahzad Akbar, then premier Imran\u2019s aide, was launched to target the opposition leaders and cases were filed against them.\nThe minister said the incumbent government had accepted the difficult conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as it was asked to fulfill them first to proceed ahead with the loan programme.\nSanaullah maintained that during the tenure of the PML-N government between 2013 and 2018, the country was on the way to progress, terrorism had come to an end and the GDP growth remained around 6.2%.\nLater, he added that a \u201cpropagandist\u201d, in a reference to Imran, was brought into power with a thin majority.\nHe continued that the propagandist was later ousted in a constitutional manner.\nThe minister claimed Imran had spread propaganda about the US cipher and tried to destabilise the constitutional government through protest calls on May 25 as well as November 26 when an important appointment was about to be announced.\nHe added that the Wazirabad attack \u2013 in which Imran suffered bullet wounds to his foot -- was also exploited and allegations were levelled against political opponents.\nSanaullah maintained that the people had rejected Imran\u2019s politics, which stood exposed in his long march which culminated in Rawalpindi.\nAfter this \u201cdefeat\u201d on the political front, the minister said a \u201cfrustrated\u201d Imran then announced the dissolution of assemblies in two provinces.\nSanaullah noted that the Constitution made it mandatory to holding elections in 90 days but it also asked for free and fair polls.\nHe said elections had been announced in Punjab on April 30, but this date was not as per the constitutional deadline of 90 days.\nThe minister also questioned the transparency of elections if held in phases.\nHe continued that allegations would be levelled if the polls for National Assembly seats were held in two provinces in the presence of elected governments.\nSanaullah maintained Imran had no answers in the cases against him including Toshakahana, prohibited funding and Tyrian White ones.\nAbout the remarks of Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial about the elections, the minister said the top judge's directions were already being followed and the PML-N's preparations were underway to participate in the provincial polls.\nSanaullah demanded that a reference should be fixed against a sitting judge of the apex court for hearing in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC).\nHe added that a reference had been filed against that judge by the Pakistan Bar Council.\nThe minister also condemned the remarks of former CJP Saqib Nisar against a female political leader in a leaked audio.\nHe said that charges of embezzlement against the judiciary should be investigated as two sons of a sitting judge allegedly remained involved in managing cases.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "In a surprising development, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday delayed the election in Punjab until October 8 on the grounds that it could not conduct transparent and peaceful polls on the scheduled date of April 30.\nIn an eight-page order, the ECP said that it could not hold the election \u201chonestly, justly and fairly in a peaceful manner due to security threats [and] in the absence of funds\u201d and being unable to provide \u201clevel-playing field\u201d to all political parties.\nIt said that the elections could not be held in Punjab under the circumstances conveyed to it by the law-enforcement agencies, finance, defence and interior ministries, Punjab chief secretary and others, who all opposed the polls on various grounds.\nSubsequently, the ECP withdrew its notification regarding the elections in Punjab and postponed the voting for the provincial assembly until October 8, 2023, adding that fresh election schedule would be announced in due course.\n\u201cThe Commission hereby withdraws the election programme issued vide Notification No. F. 2(3)/2023/Cord dated 8th March, 2023 and fresh schedule will be issued in due course of time with poll date on 08th October, 2023,\u201d the ECP order stated.\nAfter considering reports of different stakeholders, such as the interior and the defence ministries, the ECP said, it reached the conclusion that \u201cit is not possible to hold and organise elections \u2026 in accordance with the Constitution and law\u201d.\nChief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja and the ECP members, Shah Muhammad Jatoi, Nisar Ahmed Durrani, Babar Hassan Bharwana and Justice (retd) Ikramullah Khan, while referring to the briefings given by the officials concerned noted that 252 incidents of terrorism had taken place since January 2023 and they were intensifying with each passing day, particularly the cross-border incursion.\nThe ECP order comes at a time when it has increasingly become clear that the polls in Punjab may not take place on the stipulated date, while the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) governor has yet to give the timeframe for the assembly polls due in the province.\nSurprising as it may seem, when all eyes were on the joint session of parliament and a meeting of the federal cabinet on Wednesday, the ECP released its order, carrying its decision of delaying the elections in Punjab.\nIn the federal cabinet meeting, the ministers opined that general elections should be held simultaneously across the country as neither holding polls in two provinces only was possible nor security and monetary situation favoured them.\nSources said that the cabinet decided that it would convey its response to the ECP after considering all aspects of the situation.\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court ordered that President Arif Alvi should announce the date of the Punjab Assembly election, while the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) governor would set the election date for the K-P assembly in consultation with the ECP.\nA five-judge larger bench of the apex court on March 1 gave a 3-2 split verdict on a suo motu case about the election date for the two provincial assemblies after holding hearing for two days.\nThe Punjab Assembly was dissolved by then chief minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi in January on the instructions of PTI Chairman Imran Khan. Imran had also ordered the dissolution of the K-P Assembly, which was also dissolved in the same month.\nThe PTI chief has been holding rallies and protests in different cities to force the federal government for calling early election in the country. The dissolution of the Punjab and K-P assemblies was also part of his efforts for early elections.\nThe federal government has been opposing the early elections. It says that elections should be held on the same day once the incumbent government completes it constitutional term.\n"

            "Text": "The parliament is all set to discuss eight key issues being faced by the country as well as take important decisions to enforce the state\u2019s writ in connection with an ongoing anti-government campaign by former premier Imran Khan\u2019s party when the country is battling to avert default and elections are just around the corner.\nThe precarious security situation is on top of the agenda. Though the word election is missing from the agenda issued for the joint sitting of parliament, the upcoming elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and the question whether the country should go for polls in the two provinces first or opt for general elections across the country is expected to dominate the debate.\nThe government decided to summon the joint sitting of parliament after the ruling PML-N and its allied parties met at the Prime Minister House on March 20 to deliberate on the ongoing political and economic situation in the midst of prolonged anti-government defiance by Imran Khan and his party.\nIn the six-hour long huddle on Monday, the ruling coalition vowed to get tough on the PTI, claiming that the former ruling party had become a terrorist outfit over its involvement in attacking the state institutions, including the army, judiciary, and law-enforcement agencies.\nIt not only condemned the attacks carried out on the police and Rangers allegedly on the orders of the PTI chairman, when they went to Imran's Zaman Park residence in Lahore and when Imran came with his supporters to a court in Islamabad the other day, but announced that the joint session of parliament on March 22 (today) would take important decisions to ensure the writ of the state. The joint session will begin at 4pm.\nAccording to the agenda, the joint sitting of the parliament will take up eight key issues: law and order and terrorism; economic policy; Jammu and Kashmir issue; respect for national institutions; China-Pakistan Economic Corridor; population explosion; climate change impacts; and foreign policy.\nThe agenda states that the parliamentarians will discuss the national issues in order to create awareness and build consensus on the eight major issues.\nAmid alarming rise in terrorism, the parliamentarians are likely to discuss the mistakes committed in the recent past and give a way forward on how to equip law enforcers with modern equipment to counter the threats.\nThey would also take up the issue of smear campaigns run against the institutions every now and then.\nThe parliament would also examine the causes of delay in CPEC projects, especially, during the PTI rule.\nIn addition, it would contemplate on the Kashmir issue since India stripped the valley of its special status.\nThe devastating floods and havoc caused by them across the country would also be discussed in detail.\nApart from the domestic political environment, the joint sitting would envisage where the country\u2019s interests converge amid the changing geopolitical environment.\nThough elections and national census is not listed as the agenda items, it is expected that the House would deliberate on legal and constitutional hindrances if the elections are separately held in the country.\nThe PTI chief has been demanding snap polls and holding rallies and protests in different cities to force elections on the federal government since his ouster through a vote of no-confidence in April last year.\nHe had even dissolved the Punjab and K-P assemblies for the purpose.\nIn response, the government has been opposing the demand and the authorities concerned have booked Imran and PTI leadership in dozens of cases.\nAlso, the ruling coalition is trying to build consensus that elections should be held simultaneously once the incumbent government completes the constitutional term.\nThe deadlock has led to political instability and deteriorated economic situation.\nTerrorism has reared its ugly head again as the country recently saw a surge in violent attacks.\nTo add insult to injury, neither the International Monetary Fund (IMF) nor any friendly country or any other state has so far provided cash-strapped Pakistan with funds.\nInflation has broken several decades\u2019 record, petroleum products are at the highest level, currency devaluation is at its peak and, amid all this, the country\u2019s political leadership has failed to develop consensus on key issues, including the date for the general elections.\nRecently, the Supreme Court ruled that elections must be held in Punjab and K-P within 90 days of their dissolution.\nThe ECP has already fixed April 30 as the date for polls in Punjab but the federal government as well as Sindh and Balochistan governments have expressed their concern over the holding of polls in only two provinces.\nThey demanded that elections in all the provinces and Centre be held at the same time.\nThe government has been arguing that if elections in Punjab are held now, the new provincial government will have influence on polls to the National Assembly.\n"

The Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Cardiovascular Disease is set to be the world\u2019s largest cardiac hospital with a 1,200-bed facility.\nAseefa said that treatments that cost thousands of dollars abroad have been made free and accessible due to the hard work of PPP and under the leadership of Bilawal Bhutto.\nShe reminded that in the past five years, approximately over 100,000 primary angioplasties and over 25,000 cardiac surgeries have been conducted in NICVDs across Sindh. Taking exception to the criticism of distractors, Aseefa said, despite the malicious allegations being circulated against the PPP and its leadership, the reality of the situation is that the PPP is the only party to have established such revolutionary treatment centers in Pakistan. \nWhether it is Gambat Institute of Medical Science in Khairpur, providing free liver, kidney, bone marrow and cancer treatment, or the Child Life Hospitals across Sindh, or JPMC CyberKnife robotic radio-surgery targeting cancer ranging from; brain, head, neck and spine, that could cost $60,000-$90,000 abroad is available for free in Karachi.\n"

The counsel contended that housing society members have neither the ownership rights nor any legal documents, hence their title is questionable.\nThe housing society's lawyer said that the Supreme Court had ordered that no village could be established in urban areas, but 65 acres of land belonging to the Post Office Society had been encroached upon on pretext of Goth Abad scheme.\nThe lawyer for the East district assistant commissioner said the society had purchased land which was adjacent to the rural area.\nThe court adjourned the case till April 18 due to lack of time.\nAfghan woman's citizenship plea \nThe SHC issued notices to the Home secretary and National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) officials regarding the petition of an Afghan woman seeking Pakistani citizenship. \nThe counsel stated Zainab Bibi married a Pakistani citizen in 2008. She and her spouse have been residing in the Defence Housing Authority area of Karachi since 2008. \nThe authorities concerned are not processing Zainab's application for domicile although she has been living at her current address for the several years, the counsel said.\nThe Sindh chief justice remarked whether all immigrants living in Pakistan for a long time were liable to get citizenship.\n"

            "Text": "With the arrival of the holy month of Ramazan, the inflation-battered people of Karachi are now anticipating a cooking crisis with gas shortage expected to continue.\nWhere most would expect the arrival of Ramazan to be a source of peace for the practising majority, the concurrent shortage of gas has triggered immense worry among the people, who are now frantically searching for alternative options.\n\u201cRamazan holds great significance for us Muslims. How can we observe the holy month when we cannot cook food to keep our fasts and break them,\u201d complained Nishat Farooqui, a family head. Farooqui said that she had instructed her sons to look for alternative cooking fuel options to prevent a possible crisis at the times of sunrise and sunset meals of suhoor and iftar.\nAgreeing with Farooqui, a local, Faisal Ali revealed that he had already purchased a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinder to mitigate gas shortage and to have a peaceful Ramazan.\nIt seems that Ali might not be the only one as, according to Athar, a shopkeeper selling LPG cylinders and stoves. The demand for cylinders has increased manifold in the past couple of weeks since families prefer stocking up on the paraphernalia, in case shops run out by the time Ramazan begins, he said. \u201cOur cylinders are selling fast nowadays,\u201d said Athar, with cylinder cost ranging from Rs2000 to Rs3000.\nWhile some like Farooqui and Ali can afford to invest in expensive cooking gas alternatives, others like Razia Bano, a homemaker, shudder at the possibility of an added expenditure.\n\u201cInflation has already left many of us broke,\u201d said Bano. \u201cWith food in itself becoming increasingly unaffordable, we cannot even imagine spending extra money on cooking fuel,\u201d she retorted.\nMany shared strategic cooking tips and dining plans to avoid a food crisis due to shortage of gas during the holy month.nts \nHomemaker Mehak Tariq advised those involved in meal preparation to work in the kitchen during the earlier hours of the day so that cooked food is available for iftar and sehri. \u201cIn case this is not possible, people could try eating out,\u201d she suggested.\nWhile the prospect of dining might seem appealing to affluent families, the reality on-ground is that it is elusive, to say the least, for the average salaried citizen.\n\u201cMany people turn to tea stalls after Iftar, when gas is not available. But in the past one year, inflation has caused a cup of tea to cost twice as much,\u201d said Sufyan, another local. \u201cIf the gas crisis continues, it is highly unlikely that we would be able to rejuvenate ourselves by consuming tea after breaking our fast,\u201d he said.\nWhile citizens resent the need to turn to costly restaurants for basic beverages, the owners of such establishments see this as an opportunity to capitalise on the inability of people to prepare these items in their own homes. Many hotels have already started investing heavily in LPG cylinders. \n\u201cDespite LPG raising our total costs drastically, we have made the compromise since demand for our items would increase in case a gas shortage happens,\u201d said Khalid, a shopkeeper.\nAccording to sources privy to information, gas load-shedding has been taking place since the preceding winter months from 10 PM to 6 PM in Karachi, despite the arrival of the summer season.\n\u201cSince summer is here and the demand for gas has gone down, why do we still have a gas shortage is hard for me to fathom,\u201d protested Farzana Bibi.\nAs the outcry of the citizens continues, officials from the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) however, report that no updates about the availability of gas during Ramazan have been conveyed to them from the higher authorities.\n"

            "Text": "The Sindh cabinet on Tuesday approved a multibillion-rupee Ramazan package for the low-income families for the purchase of subsidised wheat flour. \nUnder the whopping Rs15.6 billion package, Rs2,000 each will be transferred to more than 7.8 million families for the purchase of 30kg wheat flour at the rate of Rs65 per kg. \nThe provincial cabinet, which met with Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah in the chair, also amended a law to increase the penalty on retailers who fail to display the official rate list of commodities and charge exorbitant prices. \n\u201cThe cash transfer to the targeted low-income families would be made through Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) for which eligible families would receive a message on their cell phones and those who do not receive such a message and their average income is less than Rs50,000 per month can send a message/CNIC number on Toll-Free 8171 Facility for inquiring about eligibility for the subsidy,\u201d CM Shah said and added that approximately 7,810,482 families with BISP\u2019s Proxy Means Test (PMT) score in the range of 1 to 60, for cash transfer of Rs2,000/family under the relief scheme.\nAccording to Shah, the total outlay of subsidy, taking 30kg wheat flour per family at Rs130/kg as a base, would translate to Rs15.62 billion. The Food Department, while briefing the cabinet, said that out of a total of 7,810,482 eligible families, Hyderabad region has 2,185,122 families, Karachi 2,296,998, Sukkur 831,975, Larkana 1,202,984 and Shaheed-Benazirabad 773,163. \nPrice control law \nIn order to control prices, particularly the price hike during the month of Ramazan, the cabinet approved amendments to the Sindh Essential Commodities Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act-2005. \nThe fine for failure to display price list has been increased from Rs50,000 to Rs100,000 for producers or dealers, Rs20,000 for retailers other than pushcart vendors, and Rs10,000 to Rs20,000 for pushcart vendors. \nSimilarly, the fine for retailers\u2019 failure to declare stocks of essential commodities has been increased from Rs50,000 to Rs100,000 and the fine for sale of commodities at a higher than officially notified price has been increased from 50,000 to Rs100,000.\nBachat Bazaars\nThe chief minister directed the chief secretary to ensure the establishment of Bachat Bazaars, one in each taluka, where provision of wheat flour, sugar, ghee, and other essential edible items at subsidised rates would be ensured. The cabinet decided to launch a drive against profiteering and hoarding. \nThe Industries Department was directed to ensure availability of stocks of sugar, vegetable oil, and other items, and the district administration, Bureau of Supply and Prices to ensure availability at the notified rates. The Utility Stores Corporation (USC) has 113 outlets in the division, and they will provide 19 items at subsidised rates.\nRescue 1122\nThe Sindh cabinet decided to establish Sindh Emergency Service Rescue 1122 for which a draft bill was presented. The cabinet was told that Sindh did not have a dedicated emergency response service and only relies on charitable organisations/NGOs. The functions of Rescue 1122 include ambulance service, water rescue, firefighting, urban search & rescue, building safety, motorbike rescue service, community safety, training of community/govt institutions/schools etc, certification for basic life support (CPR, fire drills, safety standards, etc). The cabinet approved the draft bill \u201cSindh Emergency Rescue Service-1122\u201d and referred it to the assembly. \nInstitute of mother and\nchild health\nThe cabinet also approved a draft bill for the establishment of an \u201cInstitute of Mother and Child Health\u201d at Shaheed Benazirabad. It would be as an autonomous body to be made functional through its independent board of governors. It also green-lighted the Sindh Resettlement and Rehabilitation (P&R) Policy 2023.\n"

As a result, both the industry\u2019s ability to meet local market demand and volume of exports are declining.\nThe LCCI president also said that the lack of availability of raw material is forcing businesses to lay off employees and shop owners to stop employing new employees, doubling the rate of unemployment.\nHe warned that the already strained economy will suffer further if the raw material shortfall issue is not addressed urgently.\n\u201cCurrently, it seems the government has no specific policy for the import of raw material. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar should publish a policy declaration to address the pressing problem,\u201d suggested Chaudhry.\nHe further claimed that the shortage of wheat was causing \u2018mayhem\u2019 with workers choosing to stand in line for free flour bags instead of going to work.\n\u201cLCCI has repeatedly asked the government to address the LCs problem without success. As the month of Ramzan approaches, a shortage of various items will become apparent as a result of this problem,\u201d he warned, urging the government to look into the matter immediately and find a solution.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 22nd, 2023.\n"

            "Text": "Karachi business leaders are advocating for a strong intellectual property rights (IPR) system in Pakistan, supported by technology, to harness the country\u2019s resources and expand its wealth.\nPresident of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Mohammed Tariq Yousuf, welcomed Chairman of the Intellectual Property Organisation (IPO), Farrukh Amil, stating that due to global integration, a competitive environment and technological advancements, the role of the IPO is critical for the country\u2019s economic development but there is a need to ensure strict enforcement of IPR laws at the grass root levels. \u201cA strong foundation for a vibrant IP system is needed to increase national wealth,\u201d he said.\nThe IPO chairman expressed his commitment to simplifying IP procedures through digitalisation under the IPO\u2019s long-term strategy. He emphasised the need to simplify cumbersome IP procedures to allow individuals and companies to register their products, services, and other exclusive material using their smartphones, as is done in developed countries worldwide.\nAccording to Arif Habib Commodities CEO Ahsan Mehanti, \u201cIPR rules are less effective in Pakistan due to lax punishments and incompetent law enforcement agencies.\u201d He added that implementing stronger IPR laws will benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and multinational enterprises (MNEs) by attracting talent and promoting a long-term business mindset. Mehanti also noted that well-known brands like Pepsi and Coke and prescription medications have been violated in the past, but implementing IPR rules will reduce pressure from citizens and civil rights organisations and increase foreign direct investment (FDI).\nLasbela Chamber of Commerce and Industry EFP President, Ismail Suttar suggested that Pakistan learn from other countries\u2019 IPR systems, particularly South Korea, which excels in all spheres of society. He cited a delegation\u2019s visit to South Korea 19 years ago to learn about the IPO\u2019s wonderful system, which he believes will benefit Pakistan.\nRecently, President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Irfan Iqbal Sheikh, demanded that the government establish a world-class and central intellectual property house to better protect the intellectual property rights (IPRs) of the R&D fraternity, manufacturers, and exporters. He also highlighted the importance of Trade-related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to penetrate deeper into the EU, UK, Australian, Japanese, South Korean, and North American export markets.\nThe IPO chairman acknowledged that intellectual property is a neglected subject in Pakistan as many people are unaware of the significance of trademarks, copyrights, and patents. He believes that introducing an IP-related curriculum in schools is necessary, as is done in many other countries. Currently, only Pakistani university students who choose to pursue specialised courses or degrees and the legal fraternity are aware of the importance of intellectual property, while the general public remains unaware.\nHe further emphasised the critical need for strict enforcement of IPR laws, including heavier fines and stricter punishments to protect producers\u2019 interests and save the public from counterfeit products. He noted that even fake medicines and foodstuff are widely produced, putting the lives of poor citizens at risk. Heavier fines and dire consequences for breaking the law will act as a huge deterrent to counterfeiting.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 22nd, 2023.\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the st conversation.\n"

            "Text": "The decisions of different governments to divert expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the residential consumers in winter in a bid to address gas shortages have resulted in piling up of huge consumer bills of Rs200 billion.\nIn the absence of a legal framework, the two public gas utilities running in the country have failed to recover the LNG bills from domestic consumers.\nPakistan State Oil (PSO) imports around eight to nine LNG cargoes per month from Qatar. Under the term contracts, the delivered cost of each cargo for February 2023, at the rate of $12.7148 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), comes to $41 million. The cumulative financial impact of nine cargoes imported in a month will be $369 million.\nSui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), which has not been able to recover the LNG cost from domestic consumers, has to pay Rs492 billion to PSO on account of LNG supplies. This has sparked fears of disruption to LNG imports.\nAccording to officials, LNG diversion to the domestic sector in winter always carries some tariff differential, which accumulated to a total of Rs200 billion up to February 2023. However, the budgetary subsidy to cover the differential is only Rs25 billion for the current fiscal year.\nThe Petroleum Division has so far released Rs12.50 billion after approval of the Finance Division.\nOn average, the power sector consumes up to 70% of re-gasified LNG whereas the remaining is supplied to the exporting and non-exporting industry, fertiliser manufacturers, commercial consumers, compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations, cement firms and domestic consumers.\nSNGPL provides RLNG to the exporting industry and fertiliser manufacturers at subsidised rates and their recovery is contingent upon the budgetary subsidy.\nIn the case of exporting industry, Rs40 billion has been allocated for subsidy in FY23, which is sufficient to meet the SNGPL\u2019s requirement.\nThere were pending claims of Rs26.059 billion for the subsidised RLNG supply to two fertiliser plants, ie Fatima Fertiliser and Agritech Limited, till January 3, 2023, when the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) decided to discontinue the subsidised supplies.\nFor the provision of RLNG to the power sector, payments to SNGPL were also overdue, which were not being fully realised timely.\nIn a recent meeting, the Petroleum Division informed the ECC that PSO had given an SOS call for releasing funds as the company\u2019s liquidity position was under severe stress.\nIts receivables had soared to an all-time high of Rs773 billion, most of which were owed by SNGPL, which had to pay Rs498 billion.\nOn the other hand, PSO\u2019s borrowing had reached Rs411 billion, leading to a higher finance cost of Rs43 billion in the current fiscal year and the projected Rs73 billion for next year, which would completely erode the company\u2019s profit.\nAs per contracts with LNG suppliers, PSO is required to clear an invoice on the 15th day after completion of cargo unloading and/or the 10th banking day after receipt of invoice from the supplier, whichever is later.\nThe release of budgetary subsidy is being delayed by the Finance Division owing to the constrained fiscal space and the limit on expenditures. This has led to the accumulation of subsidies of Rs14.45 billion for the exporting sector and the diversion of RLNG.\nIt may be recalled that the ECC, in its meeting held on January 3, 2023, considered and approved a summary of the Petroleum Division on the borrowing of Rs50 billion in favour of PSO backed by sovereign guarantee.\nPSO was in the process of borrowing funds as the Letter of Comfort was lately issued by the Finance Division on February 16, 2023.\nHowever, the company was of the view that even after the recent arrangement, there was not much improvement in its liquidity requirement, which may result in default on the international payment obligations.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 22nd, 2023.\n"

            "Text": "History remains alive as long as its remembrance continues. Museums serve as a gateway to a different time, and the relics preserved therein reveal stories of a distant past. Together, these relics contribute to the cultural capital. Institutions of various scales play a crucial role in preserving culture. Although their preferences may differ from one another, they ultimately contribute to the preservation of history in various forms.\nFor many people, a city is merely a place they live in, until they head out. For others, it is a place that resides within them, rather than the other way around. However, for some people, a city can take the form of a beloved, whose remembrance they long to preserve. Lahore, a city with an enchanting history, has such a place in the lives of those who love it to the core of their hearts.\nIn the heart of the city, there is a house that boasts a private collection comprising some of Lahore\u2019s finest relics. To a casual onlooker, the collection may seem like a compilation of random historical artefacts, but to careful observers, each artefact represents a different stage in the city\u2019s timeline. This place is not a museum and is not open to the public, but it still attracts visitors who want to catch a glimpse of the city that Lahore was.\nThe brainchild of Tahir Yazdani Malik, the Lahore Heritage Club, as the place came to be known, continues to be the city\u2019s best kept secret. Mr Yazdani, who passed away in 2019, did not set out to be a collector, rather he was an admirer of culture and was deeply in love with the city\u2019s heritage.\n\u201cTaking keen interest in Lahore's diverse and rich history and culture, he started collecting artifacts and antiques, which soon took up a portion of his house,\u201d his daughter, Zarafshaan Tahir, tells The Express Tribune.\n\u201cExploring Lahore's nooks and corners was like a pilgrimage to him; he loved meeting new people, establishing roots everywhere, learning about each and every person's ancestral past, and deepening his understanding of the unique traditions of diverse families along the way,\u201d she adds\nAccording to his daughter, it was his passion and deep fascination for the multifaceted city led him to preserve Pakistan's heritage and cultural crafts via this project, primarily via social media.\n\u201cHe wanted to display the cultures and the history of a city that was slowly being turned into a concrete jungle,\u201d she says.\nMr Yazdani\u2019s efforts precede the formation of the Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA). While he was still collecting relics in the early 2000s, he created an active community for the preservation of the city\u2019s history and for the dissemination of its cultural knowledge across the globe.\nToday, the Lahore Heritage Club serves as an institution and a community of like-minded people who come together for various events to celebrate the city\u2019s culture. Its artefacts are displayed on an entire floor of Mr. Yazdani\u2019s sprawling house. Many visitors have likened the place to a maze, as they navigate through its corridors looking for the crown jewels that are subtly placed here and there.\nMr Yazdani\u2019s children, Zarafshaan, Zareen and Alisher Tahir, run the institute together. They receive hundreds of requests for visits regularly, but due to logistical limitations, only open it to a limited number of guests.\nAlisher continues the guided tours the way his father once did. He eagerly welcomes visitors interested in hearing Lahore\u2019s story and guides them through the various sections of the collection. Zarafshaan lead the institute\u2019s efforts to encourage thought-provoking exchanges between people from all walks of life. Zareen, the youngest of the three siblings, is the primary influence behind poetry nights and open mics aimed at young adults.\nMr Yazdani\u2019s legacy continues with his children as the Lahore Heritage Club now explores new avenues to cater to different audiences in the city.\n"

UAF Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan congratulated the team and hoped that it would be a milestone for sugarcane production. \nPakistan is the 11th largest producer of sugarcane in the world and between 2021 and 2022, sugarcane production increased to 88.65 million tons from 81.009 million tons. Average sugarcane production in the country is 45-50 metric tons/ha, which is very low compared to the average global yield which is around 60 metric tons/ha. Two serious yield-limiting agents are weeds and pests.\nThe most damaging insect-pests of sugarcane are top borer, stem borer, gurdaspur borer, root borer, which may cause up to 50 percent of yield losses.\n"

But only 900 centres could be built.\nDue to shortage of funds, the project has been delayed since June last year.\nThe second phase of the project will cover more than 1,000 villages across the province.\nAccording to sources, work to build 110 Marakaz-e-Aab at a cost of Rs5 billion has also been delayed till next year.\nHowever, the Aab-e-Pak Authority\u2019s former chief executive officer Zahid Aziz, said the work on phased projects to provide clean drinking water to the people was also being pursued under the local government department, Punjab city programmes, Punjab Rural Aab Rasani Programme and intermediate cities programme. \nSpeaking to The Express Tribune, he said water should be used with care, so that the reservoirs could be protected for future generations.\nLahore Water a d Sanitation Agency (WASA) Managing Director Ghufran Ahmed said the World Health Organisation (WHO) had set a standard of 95 per cent of water samples collected from a city to be found safe in tests.\n\u201cOur water testing laboratory is approved under the ISO 1725 standards,\u201d he added.\nThe official said chlorinators were also being used at tube wells to provide clean water to the people after eliminating germs. He said the complaints of contaminated water were also resulting from citizens using rotten pipelines and dirty tanks. \nWith the cooperation of the Punjab government, the old decayed pipelines are being replaced in a phased manner, which will improve the water quality.\nHe also appealed to the citizens to avoid wasting water.\nAccording to sources, WASA is providing water to a population of eight million, while more than 4.4 million residents of the provincial capital are getting water from other sources.\nAbout 6,000 kilometres of water supply lines in the city have completed their viability period, of which about 40 per cent have been replaced.\nThe rest of the damaged pipelines could not be replaced due to non-availability of funds. The contamination of water in the damaged pipelines is posing a health risk to the citizens of the affected areas.\n"

            "Text": "The Peshawar High Court (PHC) issued stay order on Wednesday against making changes in the seniority list of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) police officials on 110 petitions filed by the affected cops.\nA two-member bench, comprising Justice SM Ateeq Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmed, issued the injunction order and sought replies from the inspector general (IG) of the police and the provincial chief secretary.\nDuring the hearing, Barrister Dr Adnan Khan appeared on behalf of the petitioners and raised two points in his arguments. He pointed out that there was out-of-turn promotions of mostly those who earned honours during the performance of their duties.\nThis rule, he said, was applicable in all police forces but now those cadets were being demoted to bring them on the merit of other officials. He added that a larger PHC bench had already directed the provincial government to review the relevant laws.\nAlso, the lawyer pointed out that in the 1980s, the then IG had issued a standing order that if someone spent three years as an instructor in Hangu, he would be given an out-of-turn promotion. Therefore, those policemen could not be brought at par with others.\nBarrister Adnan Khan said that there were two separate decisions of the Supreme Court in 2013 and 2017 regarding ending the out-of-turn promotion policy, but added that both the decisions were related to the police forces of Punjab and Sindh.\nNow, the K-P police were demoting their decorated officers and those who promoted in the 1980s on the basis of these decisions. He pleaded with the court that once a policy was framed and someone benefited, it could not be withdrawn.\nLater, the court issued the injunction order in this matter, staying any change in the seniority list of police officers. The bench sought replies from the IG and the chief secretary and adjourned further hearing of the case till April 4.\nCCI asked to include regional languages in census\nA two-member bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC), comprising Justice SM Atiq Shah and Justice Shakeel Ahmed, while hearing a petition filed to include some languages spoken in different regions of the country in the census, sent the matter to the Council of Common Interests (CCI).\nIt also issued instructions to the council that after reviewing all the issues, the council should take steps to include these languages in the census form.\nDuring the hearing, Shahid Ali Yeftali, the counsel for the petitioners, told the court that a new census is currently being conducted across the country.\nThree regional languages are not included in the census form, thus depriving their speakers of the opportunity of being counted, so the court should issue an order to include them in the census form.\nAfter the arguments were completed, the bench issued an order to refer the matter to the CCI and issued instructions to the council\nIt directed that after reviewing all the issues, steps should be taken to include these languages in the census form.\nOrderly distribution of free flour stressed\nKhyber-Pakhtunkhwa Caretaker Chief Minister Azam Khan on Wednesday took notice of mismanagement in the distribution of free government flour in some parts of the province. \nHe has directed the Food Department and all district administrations to take necessary steps for the orderly distribution of flour, ensuring that there are no complaints of maladministration. \nWith the month of Ramazan upon us, the chief minister emphasised the need to make the distribution of flour easy for people across the province. \nHe also directed for making every effort to ensure that people do not face any problems in obtaining flour. \nTo ensure transparency in the distribution process, he stressed the need for the strict implementation of laid-down procedures. \n"

            "Text": "\u00a0\nPTI Chairman and former premier Imran Khan on Wednesday said that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had violated the Constitution by putting off the Punjab Assembly elections till October, asking everyone to stand behind the legal community \u201cwith expectation that they will protect the Constitution\u201d.\n\u201cBy postponing Punjab elections till Oct ECP has violated the Constitution. Today everyone must stand behind the legal community - the judiciary & lawyers - with expectation that they will protect Constitution. For if this is accepted today then it is the end of Rule of Law in Pak,\u201d the PTI chief wrote on his official Twitter handle.\nHis tweet came shortly after ECP withdrew its notification regarding polls in Punjab scheduled for April 30, postponing elections for the provincial assembly until October 8.\nIn another tweet, the former premier maintained that they had not dissolved the Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa assemblies to \u201callow a bunch of fascists to impose a reign of terror\u201d.\n\u201cWe dissolved our 2 provincial legislatures with expectation that elections would be held in 90 days as clearly given in our Constitution. We did not take this action to allow a bunch of fascists to impose a reign of terror, violating the Constitution & Rule of Law.\u201d\nReacting over the commission's decision, PTI leaders said the commission had violated the Constitution and disobeyed the apex court order to hold elections in Punjab as per the constitutional obligation.\nPTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry said the ECP had violated the Constitution, noting that all its members who signed the notification to postpone elections in the province were guilty under Article 6 of the Constitution.\n\"Judges and lawyers, it's now your movement before anyone [else\u2019s]. If you fail State will call people of Pakistan will stand behind Supreme Court and the Constitution,\" he tweeted.\nIn another tweet, the PTI leader lamented that after the ECP\u2019s decision the Constitution and the apex court had virtually been \u201cabolished\u201d and the country was now without a Constitution.\n\u201cThe Constitution and the Supreme Court have been effectively abolished, Pakistan is now without a constitution.\u201d\nPTI leader Andleeb Abbas said all institutions and parties which assisted the commission to take the decision should be punished under Article 6 of the Constitution.\nWithout naming any party of the coalition government, she said, \u201cno matter what you do you cannot run away from elections\u201d.\nPTI leader Musarrat Jamshed Cheema termed the ECP\u2019s decision \u201cgross violation\u201d of the Constitution that would not go unpunished.\nThe party will not allow anyone to snatch the fundamental right of the people of Pakistan, she said.\nMeanwhile, the PML-N hailed the ECP\u2019s decision to delay elections, saying elections in Punjab and K-P could not have been held separately.\nTalking to The Express Tribune, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb observed that the election commission had taken the decision in view of the financial and security situation of the country.\nShe said elections in two provinces could not have been held separately, stressing that polls in the entire country should be held at the same time.\nWhen asked that holding polls within 90 days was a constitutional requirement and the delay was seemingly unconstitutional, Marriyum said the ECP had taken the decision in the light of the Constitution.\nShe said Constitution did not allow holding elections separately in the country, without specifying the article as the Constitution explicitly states that polls upon dissolution of provincial assembly should be held within 90 days.\nThe information minister noted that the spirit of Constitution demanded that elections are held in a peaceful atmosphere, when the country has \u201csufficient funds\u201d.\nOn being questioned whether delaying of elections would provide credence to PTI\u2019s allegations that the ECP was working on the whims of PML-N, Marriyum stated that until recently the former ruling party had been appreciating the election supervisor for taking the \u201cright decision\u201d to announce polls in Punjab on April 30.\nShe said PTI stood by an institution when a decision by them came in the party\u2019s favour and opposed them when the contrary happened.\nPPP\u2019s senior leader Hassan Murtaza, who seemed a bit taken aback by the ECP\u2019s decision, talking to The Express Tribune said that he was not aware of the details.\nHowever, he said PPP had never supported abrogation of law.\nWe cannot even think of supporting any violation of Constitution, he said, adding that his party gave Pakistan Constitution.\n"

            "Text": "All eyes are set on Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial in the wake of the Election Commission of Pakistan\u2019s (ECP) surprising volte-face on Wednesday to postpone the Punjab elections, originally scheduled for April 30, till October 8.\nCJP Bandial \u2013 who has already made it clear that the Supreme Court would interfere in case the polls were delayed \u2013\u00a0 had earlier invoked suo motu jurisdiction to hold general elections of both provincial assemblies within 90 days.\nNow, the electoral watchdog\u2019s announcement has potentially thrown the ball back to the SC\u2019s court, renewing debate whether the top court \u2013 which was divided over ideological lines \u2013 would compel the ECP and executive authorities to hold elections of two provincial assemblies immediately.\nThe twist comes at a time when a section of SC judges is being accused of \u2018tilting the scales\u2019 in PTI\u2019s favour is purportedly revealed in an alleged video leak of Muhammad Khan Bhatti, former principal secretary to ex-chief minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, in which he accused some judicial figures of supporting the PTI.\nOn the other hand, another group of SC judges was not in favour of invoking suo motu jurisdiction in this matter.\nSenior lawyers believe that in order to end controversies, CJP Bandial should constitute a full court to hear the matter regarding the delay of elections.\nPTI\u2019s lawyer Chaudhry Faisal Hussain also agreed with the assertion that a full court should take up the matter and decide whether the constitution or the \u201claw of the jungle\u201d would prevail in the country.\nEchoing Hussain, another PTI lawyer protested that it was high time that the jurists of the apex court raised above their egos and decided the matter. He pointed out that now the caretaker government\u2019s ability to perform would also be called into question, recalling that the five-member larger bench had held that the caretaker government had no authority to spend public money beyond 120 days of its tenure.\n\u201cNow it remains to be seen as to how the Punjab government works in light of the constitution as well as SC ruling,\u201d he wondered.\nMoreover, senior lawyers agree that SC should have adjudicated Justice Athar Minallah's questions examining the constitutionality regarding the dissolution of provincial assemblies.\nIt is pertinent to note that the court in its order had said that Justice Minallah's questions would be considered at any other stage.\nAccording to a senior lawyer, the questions were still relevant.\nThe legal fraternity is of the view that it would have been better for the PTI if the assemblies had been restored, allowing it to control the largest province till the general election. However, one section of lawyers termed it a \u201cconstitutional conundrum\u201d\nThey said that the SC should stay away and for a change compel the political parties to sort out this mess. Nonetheless, they agreed that now it will be impossible for the SC to be seen as an 'impartial arbiter'\nThe lawyers further opined that the top court\u2019s contempt proceeding in this matter will risk further eroding public confidence as it had now turned into a political question.\n\"SC has put itself in a difficult position. The sou moto should not have been taken and LHC allowed to conclude its proceedings. But the five members were in a hurry and in the process, they damaged the institution,\u201d said a lawyer.\nThey said that if the apex court stayed away, all political parties might sit for a political solution to the matter.\n\u2018Blatant mockery of constitution\u2019\nReacting to the development, ex-senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that delaying the elections by the ECP was a blatant mockery of the constitution and alleged that the body had surely decided this on the wishes of the government and the establishment which are terrified of the polls.\n\"With already a tarnished reputation sadly ECP now has no credibility left,\u201d he said.\n\u2018Constitutional overreach\u2019\nLawyer Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar while commenting on the present situation said that in the presence of clear provisions of Article 112 read with 224 (2) of the Constitution as well as in view of SC judgement, such postponement and rescheduling could legally be considered to be constitutional overreach on the part of the commission, and totally against the spirit and beyond to their mandate given under the constitution.\nHe further said that the rescheduling of the election schedule in Punjab was beyond the mandate of the ECP both in view of the constitutional provisions and of the Election Act 2017.\nIf there was any need to change or reschedule the election under any circumstances, it could only be amended or changed or extended by the commission with the prior concurrence of the president, and not otherwise as clearly mentioned in the language of section 58 of the Election Act 2017.\nThe lawyer said that there was a strong chance that the ECP\u2019s order would be struck down by the Supreme Court once challenged or brought to the notice of it with regard to the court\u2019s continuation of earlier proceedings.\n"

            "Text": "The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday rejected Pakistan\u2019s claim that its programme conditions were one of the reasons for delaying polls in Punjab, saying Islamabad had the right to reprioritise expenses or raise additional taxes to meet constitutional obligations.\n\u201cThere is no requirement under Pakistan\u2019s EFF [Extended Fund Facility]-supported programme, which could interfere with Pakistan\u2019s ability to undertake constitutional activities\u201d, said Esther Perez Ruiz, the resident representative of the IMF.\nThe statement came a day after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) postponed elections in Punjab\u00a0 till October 8, citing lack of security and finances to hold elections in the\u00a0 province.\nIt also suggests that the trust deficit is deepening between Pakistan and the IMF because of Islamabad\u2019s inability to meet its international as well as domestic constitutional obligations and blaming the global lender for its own failures.\nIt is for the second time in the past four days that the IMF has rebuked Pakistan\u2019s claim about interfering in matters that did not fall in the domain of the $6.5 billion bailout package, setting the record straight and refusing to offer its backing to the politics of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).\nEarlier, Ruiz had said he wanted to be categoric that there was absolutely no truth to any insinuated link between the past as well as the current IMF-supported programmes and the decision by the Pakistani government over its nuclear programme.\nIn the statement issued on Thursday, Ruiz elaborated: \u201cThe IMF sets aggregate general government targets [aggregating across federal and provincial government levels] and within these there is fiscal space to allocate or reprioritise spending or raise additional revenues to ensure constitutional activities can take place as required.\u201d\nThe ECP requires Rs20.5 billion for holding elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\nIt needs another Rs5 billion for conducting by-elections for 93 vacant seats of the National Assembly.\nIn total, the ECP requires Rs25.5 billion, which is not much compared to Rs11.2 trillion revised annual budget for this fiscal year.\nThe needed funds are equal to just 0.18% of the annual budget of the federal government.\nThe IMF resident representative further stated that decisions about the constitutionality, feasibility, and timing of the provincial and general elections vested solely with Pakistan\u2019s institutions.\nJust this week, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet approved a Rs27 billion supplementary grant to avoid default on diesel payment to Kuwait.\nTwo days ago, the planning minister launched politically-oriented development projects for the youth of the country costing Rs150 billion.\nIn its elections postponement notification, the ECP narrated a statement by the federal finance secretary.\n\u201c[The] secretary finance while briefing the commission stated that due to the paucity of funds and financial crunch, the country is facing an unprecedented economic crisis and it was under compulsion by the IMF programme which has set targets for maintenance of fiscal discipline and deficit,\u201d it read.\n\u201c[The finance secretary said] it would be difficult for [the] government to release funds now for general elections [for] the provincial assemblies of Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and later for [the] general elections [for the] National Assembly, [and the] provincial assemblies of Sindh and Balochistan,\u201d it added.\nThe ECP further stated that the federal government had conveyed that because of the critical economic situation of the country, it would be very difficult to provide funds for the elections at the moment and additional money for the staggered polls.\nThe details showed that in case of segregated elections, the additional cost was Rs9.3 billion.\nLast month, the federal cabinet had revised the budget estimates to Rs11.2 trillion -- an increase of Rs1.3 trillion or 17% over the one passed just eight months ago.\nThe government has also revised the estimate of provincial surpluses downwards to Rs559 billion, compared with the budgetary figure of Rs750 billion.\nAs a result, the overall deficit has been projected at Rs5.7 trillion, or 6.8% of the GDP.\nFor its programme purposes, the government has set the primary deficit target at Rs465 billion, or 0.5% of GDP, compared with the previous target of Rs153 billion in surplus.\nThis month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also announced free wheat flour schemes worth Rs73 billion in the two provinces where the elections were due under the Constitution.\nThe cost of these schemes, funded by provincial governments, is almost three times more than the funds needed for holding the elections in the two provinces.\nThe Rs73 billion spending on wheat flour subsidy might jeopardise the recently agreed fiscal framework with the IMF that requires Rs559 billion provincial cash surpluses.\nThe sources said that K-P had informed the prime minister that it did not have the entire Rs19 billion funds to finance the free wheat flour scheme.\nThe plan is to give free wheat flour to 5.7 million families in the province.\nThe IMF\u2019s country head said the programme discussions had exclusively focused on economic policies to solve Pakistan\u2019s economic as well as balance of payments problems, in line with the the global lender\u2019s mandate for promoting macroeconomic and financial stability.\n"

            "Text": "Another religious scholar, Maulana Salim Khatri of Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat (AWJ), was gunned down in the metropolitan city on Wednesday, a day after Maulana Abdul Qayyum Sufi Naqshbandi of the Sunni Ulema Council was killed in a targeted attack.\nFour gunmen riding on two motorcycles shot and killed Maulana Khatri in Sector 5-E of New Karachi in the remits of Bilal Colony police station, according to police and witnesses. The 58-year-old cleric was sitting at a pan-shop at 3pm near his house when he was targeted. \nActing SP for New Karachi Kunwar Asif told the media that Maulana Khatri was pronounced dead on arrival at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital where he was shifted after the shooting. He was shot five times, while police have found seven empties of 9mm pistols at the crime scene, SP Asif said. \u201cWe are obtaining footage from the CCTV cameras installed in the area,\u201d he added.\nBilal Colony police station SHO Aftab Abbasi confirmed that the assailants were four in number but only two of them opened fire on Maulana Khatri. He added that the incident appeared to be a targeted attack.\nFootage from one CCTV camera that has been shared on social media shows two men, who are believed to be attackers, running out of the area. Witnesses say that the attackers crossed the road where two motorcycles with their riders were waiting for them.\nA large number of ASWJ leaders and workers arrived at the hospital after the news of the attack broke. They said \u201canti-state elements\u201d were ruining Karachi's peace while the rulers were unable to maintain law and order. ASWJ's General Secretary Taj Muhammad Hanfi said that the funeral of the slain leader would be held at 10pm.\nMeanwhile, protesters blocked the highway near the Edhi morgue in Sohrab Goth where Maulana Khatri's body was taken from the hospital after medico-legal formalities. The protest, which disrupted the traffic flow for some time, was ended after police assured the protesters that those responsible would be brought to justice. \nThe targeted shooting came a day after Maulana Abdul Qayyum Sufi Naqshbandi of the Sunni Ulema Council was shot dead while walking back home from mosque after Fajr prayers in Gulistan-e-Jauhar. \nMufti Muneebur Rehman, while speaking at Maulana Sufi's funeral, said that the \u201cconstruction mafia\u201d could be possibly involved in the murder.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "Organised criminal gangs are illegally selling lands belonging to the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) in Surjani Town Block 8, the Sindh High Court (SHC) was informed during the hearing of a petition regarding alleged land grabbing in the town.\nThe KDA officials, through their counsel, submitted a report stating that plots are being sold in the name of fake societies under different names. Advertisements have been published in national newspapers regarding the illegal sale of lands, the report further states. The operation to evict squatters from encroached KDA land could not be completed due to a lack of manpower and resources.\nThe court ordered removal of encroachments and illegal constructions and submission of a compliance report on March 30. The court also ordered that help should be sought from the Rangers and police for retrieval of KDA land from squatters.\nMeanwhile, a two-judge SHC bench on Wednesday accepted a request for urgent hearing of a petition regarding non-implementation of a ban order on carcinogenic tobacco chew, such as gutka and main puri, by police, and issued notices to the Sindh chief secretary, home secretary, IGP Sindh and additional IGP Karachi.\nAppearing before the bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro, the petitioner's lawyer Muzzammil Mumtaz Meo Advocate stated that the provincial police, including IGP, were not implementing the court ban orders on gutka and main puri. Two officers in the SSP Malir office, namely Moin and Asghar, are patronising the gutka mafia, as per the petitioner. Despite a ban, the sale of gutka and main puri continues. \nAccording to a report by the doctors at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, the number of mouth cancer patients has gone up. People from the poor class are falling victim to different diseases due to the use of gutka and main puri. \nThe petitioner claimed that the SHOs of police stations were involved in the sale of gutka and main puri. Only in Malir district, 30 to 35 gutka and main puri factories are being operated. The SHOs are receiving Rs3 million per week from these factories. The head muharrir of every police station receives Rs35,000 per month from each cabin selling gutka and main puri. \nThe petitioner sought a court direction to the provincial police chief to take action against these policemen. The court accepted the request for an urgent hearing of the application and issued notices to the chief secretary, home secretary, IG Sindh and AIG Karachi.\nM9 corruption scam\nThe Sindh High Court (SHC) has nullified a banking court decision on the bail petition of Mukhtiar Ali Chandio, manager of a bank in Naushahro Feroze, and Saud ul Haq in alleged Rs3 billion embezzlement in acquisition of land for the Hyderabad Sukkur Motorway, M9, while ordering the trial court to decide the petition within 10 days.\nAppearing before a two-member SHC bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro, on Wednesday, public prosecutor GM Bhutto stated that government officials and private individuals were involved in the M9 corruption scandal. Four suspects, including a former deputy commissioner of Naushahro Feroze, have fled the country. \u201cThe scam, which involves Rs.3.4 billion, is huge and hence should be transferred to NAB,\u201d he further stated.\nJustice Kalhoro observed that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) was mainly involved in all such inquiries these days. \u201cLaws should be implemented to catch culprits in the white-collar crimes,\u201d he observed while regretting that in major cases, even challan was not presented for four to five months.\nThe court asked the public prosecutor to implement the law or change it.\n"

            "Text": "While the state of educational institutions in the entire country is nothing to boast about, one institution in Sindh can be singled out for being so miserably run that it is on the brink of closing down for good. \nThe Benazir Bhutto Shaheed University Lyari, has been functioning without a permanent Vice Chancellor (VC) for the past year and is presently being looked after by ad hoc appointments, which seemingly have no interest in running the daily affairs of the institute. Furthermore, the university neither has a permanent Registrar nor does it have a Director Finance. \nIt is pertinent to mention that the university got to the brink of closure it is at right now after its VC, Professor Dr Akhtar Baloch, was sent on leave in February of 2022 due to allegations of misconduct with a female Member of Provincial Assembly (MPA). Allegedly Dr Baloch had sent a provocative emoji to the MPA and the case was referred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). However, even though the FIA\u2019s inquiry did not prove the allegation against the VC, the Secretary of Universities and Boards Department, Mureed Rahimoon, saw it fit to remove Dr Baloch, and sent a summary in this regard to the Chief Minister. \nWhen asked about the inordinate delay in deciding the VC\u2019s fate, Rahimoon replied: \u201cThe summary has been sent to the Chief Minister and he will decide on the matter soon.\u201d\nWhile it remains to be seen how soon the Chief Minister decides Dr Baloch\u2019s fate, the ad hoc system that is running the institute has failed miserably, as per sources privy to the information. The Express Tribune learnt that there is no Dean for any of the 9 departments of the university; there are only 4 associate professors working; and a whopping 60 per cent of the academic load has gone to part-time teachers or visiting faculty. Moreover, the institute\u2019s finances are also in poor shape, as it recently had to pay salaries through its reserve funds. \nInterim VC of the Benazir Bhutto Shaheed University Lyari, Dr Amjad Siraj Memon, who is the permanent VC of Jinnah Sindh Medical University, when asked about the university being in disarray, conceded that the institute had seen better days. \u201cThe financial situation is dire evidenced by the budget deficit as we have to pay different allowances on top of the salaries to the teachers,\u201d informed Dr Memon, adding that a cut in allowances meant that teachers would start protesting. \u201cThe university is marred by multiple issues, one of which is my life constantly being threatened by the gangs in Lyari. Another is the lack of funds to hire new teachers,\u201d regretted Dr Memon while talking to The Express Tribune.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "The government has finalised a panel for the appointment of new deputy governor of the central bank and also notified a new senior adviser to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as the vacation of both positions in the past few months was proving costly for Pakistan.\nThe government notified Saifullah Dogar as senior adviser to the executive director of the IMF after the global lender endorsed Pakistan\u2019s nomination. Dogar is currently serving as a joint secretary in the external finance wing and is dealing with IMF affairs.\nThe position of the senior adviser had been vacant for over three months after Dr Saeed Ahmad completed his term. Ahmad is likely to be appointed as the new deputy governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), as his name tops a three-candidate panel for the post.\nAccording to sources, the finance ministry on Tuesday dispatched a summary to the Cabinet Division for placement before the cabinet for its decision. The other two candidates are Ashraf Khan and Qasim Nawaz, who are currently serving in the central bank.\nDogar was interviewed by the IMF a few days ago and after that his three-year appointment notification was issued by Pakistan. He will take charge of his responsibilities later next month. A finance ministry official confirmed the new appointment at the IMF.\nThe appointment of the senior adviser is being made at a time when Pakistan\u2019s relations with the IMF are seemingly strained. After meeting many harsh conditions like increasing electricity, gas and fuel prices, and jacking up interest rate, the government suddenly made an irrational move by announcing a petrol subsidy of Rs50 per litre. IMF\u2019s Resident Representative Esther Perez told The Express Tribune that Pakistan did not consult it in advance before announcing the subsidy and the IMF had sought details, which included \u201cprotections against fraud and abuse\u201d.\nSources said that the government\u2019s subsidy decision had further increased difficulties for the finance ministry, which was already struggling to convince the IMF to announce a staff-level agreement.\nDogar will not only have to deal with these difficulties brought about by the derailed programme, but will also have to lay the groundwork for a new IMF programme.\nPakistan\u2019s continued erratic and fiscally irresponsible decisions have created a wide gulf between Islamabad and the IMF staff, management and executive board. Nobody is ready to trust Pakistan anymore, according to Washington-based sources.\nSome informal pressure groups were also working to further widen the trust deficit. Dogar has to work hard to bridge this gulf through background contacts.\nDealing with Pak-IMF relations is a small but important part of the senior adviser\u2019s job. The senior adviser also assists the IMF executive director, who represents eight countries on the IMF executive board.\nIn addition to this, the senior adviser is also required to assist the executive director in dealing with financing requests from member countries, submit Article-IV reports of members and handle policy papers.\nSources said that under such circumstances, Pakistan needed its representative in the IMF to convince its board members about the dire need for a bailout programme and mend its relationship with the lender.\nFinance ministry sources said that a summary had been moved for the consideration of federal cabinet for the appointment of third deputy governor of the SBP. The post has been vacant since January 26 in violation of the SBP Act that demands filling such posts within one month.\nFinance ministry sources said that Dr Saeed Ahmad was the favourite candidate due to his experience in monetary policy. The central bank faces issues of lack of human resources on the monetary policy side after its experienced people either left the bank or went on leave.\nThe summary has been moved two weeks before a scheduled meeting of the Monetary Policy Committee that is again set to increase the interest rate in the range of 2% to 3%.\nEarlier this month, the central bank increased the rate by 3% but it was below expectations of the IMF, which wanted a major hike to contain a 50-year high inflation.\nDr Saeed Ahmed and Ashraf Khan had also been considered for the post of SBP governor last year.\nThe amended SBP Act states that deputy governors shall be appointed by the federal government after consultation between the minister of finance and the governor, from amongst a panel of three candidates recommended by the governor for each vacant position, in order of merit.\nIn the order of merit, Ahmed is on top of the panel. He has experience in monetary policy, economics and central banking with 35 years of management practice, and substantive experience in international finance and development, monetary policy formulation, financial inclusion, and development finance policy.\nHe is a PhD in Economics from the University of Cambridge and did MSc in Economics from the University of Warwick, the UK.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 23rd, 2023.\n"

Four Brothers Group Chairman Engineer Jawed Salim Qureshi highlighted the role of private sector in introducing biotechnology. He noted that it was high time to take ambitious and bold decisions to improve the national economy and agricultural production.\nQureshi was of the view that the agriculture sector alone had the ability to boost the economy through timely interventions. \u201cThere is an urgent need to start the use of modern technology, early warning and best scientific practices, emphasised Tara Group Chairman Dr Khalid Hameed.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 23rd, 2023.\n"

            "Text": "Export-oriented industries are under extreme financial crunch and are facing losses of billions of rupees as their liquidity remains stuck due to delay in release of sales tax refunds.\n\u201cThe government has stopped releasing all the sales tax refund claims whereby exporters\u2019 precious liquidity worth billions of rupees have been stuck,\u201d Value-Added Textile Forum Coordinator Muhammad Jawed Bilwani said at a joint press conference of value-added textile associations held at the Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers & Exporters Association (PHMA) House.\n\u201cThe prime minister, finance minister and their economic team have completely ignored the export sector, mainly the value-added textile sector, which is on the verge of collapse owing to the government\u2019s anti-business and anti-export mindset,\u201d he lamented.\nThe Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has issued Sales Tax General Orders (STGO), which have caused further disruption in the processing of sales tax claims, without consultation with the stakeholder associations, Bilwani said.\nEarlier, the exporters were happy with the functioning of the FBR\u2019s FASTER system, which was processing claims electronically as per law and rules without any delay.\nThe FASTER system was introduced to end human intervention and process the sales tax claims electronically, while the new parameters introduced in the STGO involving FBR officials will defer the sales tax claims and again open the floodgates to corruption, Bilwani remarked.\nAccording to an estimate, approximately 60% of exporters\u2019 liquidity is lying frozen with the FBR. As a result, the textile export industry has become unviable and is on the verge of collapse.\nBesides, a sharp decline in exports and foreign exchange earnings is hindering production while the country\u2019s economic managers are not giving any heed to the repeated distress calls to save the export industries facing the most difficult times in history.\nIndustries continue to suffer due unavailability of gas and uninterrupted power supply, shortage of industrial inputs/ raw materials caused by restrictions on opening of Letter of Credits (LC), discontinuation of DLTL and Regionally Competitive Energy Tariff.\n\u201cThe Prime Minister has no time to meet the exporters as four scheduled meetings during last four months have been postponed in a row,\u201d he regretted.\nPakistan\u2019s textile exports dropped significantly by 11% in February 2023 to $1.18 billion, Topline Securities textile sector analyst Nasheed Malik stated.\n\u201cThe decline was primarily due to a decrease in the value-added textile exports, such as ready-made garments and knitwear that went down 13% and 18% respectively,\u201d he added.\nIn terms of volume, exports of knitwear, towels, and bed-wear exports fell by 16%, 10%, and 9% respectively, whereas exports of ready-made garments increased by 15%. This decline indicates a wider deterioration in global textile demand as major textile exporting countries such as Bangladesh, China, and Vietnam have experienced similar declines.\nDuring 8MFY23, textile exports in Pakistan amounted to $11.22 billion, indicating a YoY decline of 11.\n\u201cThe major exports markets, such as the USA and Europe continue to be a concern for Pakistan\u2019s textile sector as demand from those markets is on decline,\u201d Malik cited.\nFor FY2023, we expect textile exports to be in a range of $16-17 billion as compared to the target of $25 billion.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 23rd, 2023.\n"

The police officers, usually showing\u00a0laxity, would not go the extra mile to fetch their identity. Police would face trouble in dealing with underage suspects.\nDIG Information and Technology (DIG IT) Ahsan Younis has asked field officers to take special measures in this regard and has shared the improved Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) with them.\nYounis on behalf of IG Punjab had asked the field officers to reform the suspects' arrest entry registration system. The police will also contact the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA) to verify the CNICs of suspects above the age of 18. Additionally, efforts will be made to obtain the B-Form of suspects under the age of 18.\n"

The app was supposed to provide the basis for evaluating the performance of the officials involved in the campaign.\nHe said the teachers were already coping with heavy workload because of preparing for the annual exams and also performing census duties. Now they also have to participate in tree plantation. \"Still we have written to the department concerned to solve the problems being facing in using the app,\" he added.\nThe official said complaints of errors in the app had been received from across the province. He expressed hope that the issue would be resolved.\nHe said a large number of trees had to be planted in about 48,000 government schools in the province.\n\"All users are facing issues in logging in, which is preventing them from using the app. The issue needs to be addressed urgently. Unless the login issues are resolved, the app will remain inaccessible to users,\" the Punjab School Education Department stated in the letter.\nThe Plant for Prosperity app has been launched for government departments of Punjab for plantation under an urban and peri-urban forest policy. \nAn official of the forestry and fisheries department said all government departments had been contacted for the tree plantation.\nHe said the role of the school education department was important for the success of the plantation initiative in the province.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 23rd, 2023.\n"

They eventually managed to locate them. \nAccording to the victim\u2019s brother, Salim had killed his sister due to alleged doubts about her character. \nThe Sadar Samundri police have registered a case against Salim under Sections 302 and 311 of the PPC and are attempting to apprehend him. \nFollowing the investigation, Irum\u2019s body was handed over to her relatives, and the authorities are working to ensure that justice is served in the case. \nLess than a week ago, a man had killed his daughter-in-law and injured his grandchildren, police said. \nIn a separate incident, a man had strangled his wife on suspicion over her character, they said.\nPolice seized the bodies, registered cases and arrested the suspects.\nEighty-year-old Mohammad Ali, a resident of Chak No. 215 RB Nethari area of Saddar Police Station, had had an argument with his daughter-in-law, Nasira Bibi, 45, over children taking milk.\nAs a result of this quarrel, Mohammad Ali allegedly stabbed his daughter-in-law Nasira Bibi and her children, 16-year-old Usman, eight-year-old Noman, 12-year-old Maryam and five-year-old Khadija, while they had been asleep, police said. \nThe injured were shifted to the Civil Hospital.\nAs soon as information about the incident was received, the Saddar Police reached the spot and seized the body of the slain woman. The police arrested the suspect along with the murder weapon and opened their investigation.\nIn another incident, Ijaz Ahmad, a resident of Chak No. 86 Tehsil, District Sargodha, told the police that his sister had married Mohammad Ali 12 years ago. \nThe couple had three children, Bilal, Rabia and Usman.\nIjaz Ahmed told the police that suspect Mohammad Ali strangled his sister while she had been asleep. \nThe suspect later surrendered before the police. \nPolice seized the body of the deceased and handed it over to her heirs after postmortem.\nIn Chichawatni, a 55-year-old woman and her 24-year-old adopted daughter had been strangled this month.\nPolice said that the 24-year-old deceased had married Abu Sufyan five years ago against the wishes of her maternal uncles. \nPolice said that the other deceased, Rashidan Bibi, 55, a working woman, had been a widow who had had no children of her own so she had adopted Rabia Bibi, who was a daughter of one of Rashidan\u2019s relatives. \nRashidan Bibi had also adopted a boy who had now become a grown up man with a wife. Rashidan Bibi had been living with her adopted son and his wife.\n"

            "Text": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Friday called out Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan for his \"hypocrisy\" in seeking help from the US.\nThe PML-N leader made the remarks while addressing a foreign media news conference in Islamabad along with Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb.\nAsif claimed that the series of events that have taken place after the vote of no-confidence last year \u201cshows the total sum of Imran\u2019s journey \u2014 his dismissal from the government and now his SOS to the US for help\u201d.\n\u201cHis political journey started with a cipher \u2014 in which he had accused the US of conspiring against the PTI government,\" said Asif.\n\u201cAnd today, Shireen Mazari has written a letter to the US for him [\u2026] the country he once accused of conspiracy \u2026 he is now seeking help from them,\u201d he added.\nThe defence minister claimed that on one hand, Imran had accused former army chief General (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa of conspiring against him while in office and on the other the then premier had offered Gen Bajwa an extension for life.\nHe further reiterated that Imran had accused the US of conspiring against him and is now \"flirting with the American government\" for some sort of aid due to the \"victimisation of PTI\" in Pakistan.\n\"He [Imran] will tell you one thing today and say the opposite tomorrow. His utterances are completely irrational,\" said Asif.\nHe added that Imran's followers may believe him but most people have lost track of all that the PTI chief has said over the past year.\nCommenting on Imran's behaviour, Asif said \"nowhere in the world has an accused ever refused to appear in court\". He added that the deposed PM has been giving excuses related to his security for not appearing in court.\n\"His [Imran's] appearance in court is accepted while he sits in a car,\" said Asif.\nHe also accused Imran of attacking courts as they are \"mobbed by his supporters\" when he appears, adding that courts are intimidated and come under pressure as they face threats from PTI supports.\n\"When the police were sent to his residence to arrest him, they were also attacked,\" said the defence minister. He stated that at least 70-80 police officers, including senior officials, were injured trying to arrest the PTI chief.\nAsif said that this has never happened in Pakistan in the past, adding that former leaders have \"surrendered in a dignified manner\" and \"never physically contested their arrest or abused and maligned the courts\".\nHe noted that when Imran was in power, \"almost all of PML-N\u2019s top leadership was arrested, including Nawaz Sharif who came back from the UK to surrender,\" adding that there was never any resistance from their side.\nSharing a video of the clashes between PTI supporters and the police, Aurangzeb said that when police went to arrest Imran as per court orders, the PTI chief \"defied orders, violated the law, attacked policemen and used women and children as a human shield\".\n\"Imran Khan is a desperate man,\" said Asif, accusing the PTI chief of demonstrating a type of violence that \"has never happened in Pakistan\".\nThe defence minister noted that political governments have never resorted to violence against their opponents. \"Such organised violence against state machinery is unprecedented in our history despite the problems we\u2019ve had over the past 75 years,\" he said.\nGovt 'willing' to talk to Imran\nWhen asked about the possibility of talks with Imran, the defence minister said that in the past year, the present government has been willing to talk on many occasions.\nHowever, he added, Imran has only been interested in talks with the military but \"never the political leadership\". He said that the PTI chief met with Gen (retd) Bajwa many times when he was the army chief and made attempts to negotiate with him.\nThe minister said that the government is \"ready to talk for the sake of peace in our country,\" and that there must be a consensus on major issues Pakistan has faced for decades.\n\"We don\u2019t want a transactional dialogue, we want something comprehensive,\" he added.\nAnswering a question regarding elections in the country, Asif said that general elections are due in October and will be held on time.\nRegarding the Punjab Assembly elections, the PML-N leader said that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has made its decision and according to the constitution, the ECP is the body empowered to hold elections.\n'Cult following'\nResponding to a question regarding Imran's allegations against Punjab police for conspiring to murder him, Asif said that the PTI chief is making \"scandalous\" claims.\nHe added that Imran's followers are \"ready to believe anything he says,\" claiming that his following is like \"a cult\" where the ousted premier's supporters follow him blindly, believing everything the PTI chief says.\n\"Imran has a cult following but it will fizzle out,\" said the defence minister, adding that the alleged conspiracies to murder the ex-PM are \"fabricated lies\".\nAsif said that the coalition government is governing the country under exceptionally difficult circumstances, administratively, financially and politically.\n"

In compliance with requirements of Section 5 (3) of the SJC Procedure of Enquiry Rules 2005, I am directed to require you to file your affidavit in support of the allegations made in the complaint.\"\nIt is learnt that the complainant will submit the affidavit in the current week.\nMeanwhile, the SJC also sought a certified copy of the resolution from the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) wherein it was resolved that the complaint would be filed against the SC judge.\nAll provincial bars had also resolved to move a complaint of misconduct against the SC judge.\nHowever, it was learnt that the bars, wherein Professional Lawyers Group was dominant, were reluctant to file complaints. The same group was also close to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). On the other hand, the bars, wherein Independent Lawyers Group was in majority, were filing complaints against the SC judge. This group was supporting the incumbent PDM government since April last year.\nOne member of the SJC, Lahore High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid, was retiring on March 30. The new LHC Chief Justice, Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, will replace him as member of the council.\nAccording to Section 7 of the SJC Inquiry of SJC Procedure of Enquiry Rules 2005, \u201conce any information in respect of enquiry into the conduct of a judge is received by any member or the council, it shall be presented to the chairman of the council, who; shall (a) refer the same to any member of the council to look into the said information; and to express his opinion in relation to sufficiency or otherwise of the information; (b) if the council is satisfied that the information prima facie discloses sufficient material for an enquiry, it shall proceed to consider the same\u201d.\nIt added, \u201c(2) The member, to whom the chairman has referred the information, will examine the same and ascertain if the information so received discloses specific particulars of misconduct, and provides factual details necessary to form prima facie opinion in respect of the guilt of the judge.\n\u201c(3) If the member forms an opinion that the information does reveal sufficient material to commence enquiry, he shall inform the council accordingly and the information shall be placed before the council.\n\u201c(4) If the member comes to a conclusion that the information is false, frivolous, concocted or untrue, he shall inform the council accordingly and may recommend action against the person who initiated the information.\u201d\nChief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial being chairman of the SJC might seek an opinion from Justice Qazi Faez Isa or Justice Sardar Tariq Masood over these complaints against the SC judge. So far four complaints had been filed in the SJC against the SC judge. However, CJP Bandial expressed displeasure over the audio/video leaks related to judges.\nThe SJC initiated the process regarding verification of the complaint against the SC judge.\n"

I only have to serve the people for their betterment,\u201d he added.\nNaqvi said only the cost of setting up a Ramazan Bazaar this year was coming to Rs5 billion.\nHe further noted that earlier, even those who owned land cruisers bought flour at subsidised rates, but only the deserving people would receive it free of charge this time.\nHe added that the deserving people could have themselves registered for free flour through the Benazir Income Support Programme.\nHe informed reporters that those without a CNIC were being listed in registers and the process of providing them with free flour had already been kicked off.\n"

The investigating officer said that the co-accused has been identified while Hasan Niazi\u2019s arms and vehicle were to be recovered.\nThe PTI lawyers said that more than 72 hours have passed since his arrest but the police could not recover the (said) weapon.\nThe PTI counsel raised the question that if the arms and vehicle were not in possession of the police, then why have they detained Hassan Niazi?\nLawyer Faisal Chaudhry said that the police failed to trace the vehicle and its owner in the last 72 hours. He said that Hassan Niazi is a professional lawyer and he obtained three bails on the day of his arrest.\nHe said that cases were being registered against PTI leaders on political grounds. He said that a lawyer was detained for three days and given a message that he would be arrested and tortured. He said that Islamabad police were humiliating a professional lawyer.\nPTI\u2019s lawyer Ali Bukhari pleaded to discharge Hassan Niazi from the case, saying that his arrest was illegal.\nLawyer Qaiser Imam said that according to the police, the co-accused ran away while waving the weapon. He asked what kind of friendship is this.? \u201cBeing the president of the Islamabad Bar Association, I am very ashamed,\u201d he added.\nAfter hearing the arguments of the parties, Duty Magistrate Mureed Abbas reserved the verdict on the plea for the extension in the physical remand of Hassan Niazi.\nLater, the court announced the reserved verdict, rejecting the police plea for further physical remand of Hassan Niazi. The court issued an order to send him to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.\nThe duty magistrate wrote in a two-page verdict that \u201caccording to the registered case, Hassan Niazi interfered in government affairs. According to the case, Hassan Niazi threatened the police and broke the barriers and the co-accused ran away from the crime scene.\n"

            "Text": "While academic activities continue to remain suspended at the Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) after two student groups clashed on the campus last month, the top-ranking higher education institution has announced it will start on-campus classes for MPhil and PhD programmes from Monday (March 27).\nAccording to a notification issued by the QAU registrar, MPhil and PhD students should report to their respective departments immediately.\nOn the other hand, classes of BS programmes have been made online during Ramazan.\nThe QAU administration has asked BS students to get themselves registered for online classes during Ramazan.\nThe hostel allotment to the students could not be finalised yet, which continues to take a toll on the students including females who had been evicted from hostels.\nAccording to a notification issued earlier by the QAU registrar, the rules of hostel allotments have been amended in the new policy. According to the new policy, all previous hostel allotments had been cancelled and students will have to apply for hostel rooms under the new policy.\nSources said that the university administration was facing many difficulties in starting on-campus classes and opening hostels, which are being renovated and repaired.\nThe sources claimed that the on-campus classes for BS programmes will be started after Eidul Fitr as the administration thinks a large number of students for BS programmes will have to come to the campus to use labs and other facilities.\nThe sources said that the hostels\u2019 administrations will decide on seats keeping in mind the number of students in each department. The chairperson or director of the department will recommend the names of the students for these seats and will be bound to follow the merit list strictly. After the first merit list, a fresh merit list will be prepared after every two semesters.\nThe allotment for MPhil students will be made for four semesters and the allotment for PhD students will be made for the first four years and there will be no extension of allotment. First-semester students of BS programmes will be given priority in hostel allotments.\nUnder the new hostel policy, the merit list of the previous semester will be taken into consideration in the current situation or later when a seat becomes vacant in the hostel. It will be mandatory for the students to show their hostel cards while entering the hostels. \nThe chairperson or director of any department will be responsible for the supervision of the students during their stay in the hostels. In case of violation of the rules, the allotment will be canceled immediately. The notification further states that no guest of the students will be allowed to stay in the hostels.\nSimilarly, no attachment of students will be allowed. Hostel timings will be strictly followed for undergraduate students; however, some flexibility will be extended to MPhil and PhD students. Gates of all hostels will be closed at 10 pm. According to the notification, the hostels\u2019 administrations will also ensure that mess bills are paid every month and no exemption will be given without the permission of the administrations. A penalty will be imposed in case of non-payment of the mess bill for two months and allotment can also be cancelled.\nThere will be no hostel facility for the students studying in centres. If the centres provide funds to the university, their students can be accommodated in the future.\nThe committee members have also suggested that merit should be ensured for admissions to MPhil and PhD programmes as merit was ignored in the past while giving admissions to doctoral programmes.\nThe sources said that the committee has recommended strict legal action against those involved in creating law and order and harming peace on the campus.\nA proposal has also been made that the university administration with the support of the Islamabad Capital Territory Administration and Islamabad police should form a committee to hold a monthly meeting to evaluate the already taken measures to maintain the law and order and further make it more sustainable.\nEarlier, the QAU administration, with the help of police, dislodged hundreds of students including females from various hostels and closed down the campus for two weeks. The move came after two student groups clashed on the campus, which left several students injured.\nThe QAU administration also cancelled the allotment of rooms and formed a 21-member committee to review the criteria for the reallocation of rooms to the students.\nOn February 27, the university administration suspended and expelled 79 students for vandalism on the campus and their degrees had also been cancelled.\nThe sources said that the revised policy will also be applicable to girls' hostels in the autumn session for the year 2023.\nMeanwhile, the QAU students have demanded that Vice-Chancellor Dr Niaz Ahmed Akhtar conduct an audit of the appointments made in the university in the last four years. \nThey also said that the Higher Education Commission should thrash out a mechanism for monitoring the financial affairs of universities across the country, including the QAU.\n\u00a0\n"

The nation thus stood divided on the matter.\nHowever, in 2021, Maulana Azad took over the position and held a meeting on April 14. The date he announced was observed across the country. In 2022, he once again held a meeting in Peshawar on April 3 and ensured the same day of fasting across the country.\nThis year as well, the central committee meeting was held in Peshawar on Wednesday, and the start of the holy month was announced from Thursday.\nWhile the controversy surrounding the start of Ramazan seems to have been sorted out, there has been a lack of consensus over Eidul Fitr for the past two years.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "President Dr Arif Alvi on Friday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif emphasising that he should direct all the executive authorities concerned with federal and provincial governments to assist the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in holding the elections in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa within the constitutional timeframe.\nThrough the letter, the president conveyed to the premier that holding elections in the two provinces was necessary to comply with an order of the Supreme Court issued on March 1, saying the order should be abided by to avoid further complications, including contempt of court proceedings.\nWithout mincing any words, Dr Alvi underlined that in his opinion \u201cflagrant violation of the Constitution had been committed by the executive authorities and government departments\u201d.\nHe added that the ECP had not implemented the announcement of holding elections in Punjab on April 30, 2023, and also \u201cblatantly violated the Supreme Court\u2019s order dated March 1, 2023\u201d.\nAlso, President Alvi alleged, \u201cIt appeared that federal and caretaker governments in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa advised the heads of departments concerned to indicate their inability to provide the necessary support for holding general elections.\u201d\nHe referred to Article 220 of the Constitution which stated: \u201cIt shall be the duty of all executive authorities in the federation and in the provinces to assist the commissioner and the Election Commission in the discharge of his or their functions.\u201d\nThe president\u2019s letter came after the ECP on March 22 announced delay in the election in Punjab until Oct 8 on the grounds that it could not conduct transparent and peaceful polls on the scheduled date of April 30.\nIn an eight-page order, the ECP said that it could not hold the election \u201chonestly, justly, and fairly in a peaceful manner due to security threats [and] in the absence of funds\u201d and being unable to provide \u201clevel-playing field\u201d to all political parties.\nThe ECP said that the elections could not be held in Punjab under the circumstances conveyed to it by the law enforcement agencies, finance, defence and interior ministries, Punjab chief secretary and others, who all opposed the polls on various grounds.\nMeanwhile, President Alvi accused PM Shehbaz of holding \u201cno meaningful consultation with the President on policy issues\u201d, saying it was the responsibility of the prime minister to furnish information relating to the administration of affairs of the federation and proposals for legislation.\nIn the letter, President Alvi stated, \u201cIt was a matter of concern that no meaningful consultation with the President on policy issues had been undertaken by the Prime Minister in line with Article 46 of the Constitution.\u201d\nAlvi reminded Shehbaz that the article says that the prime minister shall keep the president informed on all matters of internal and foreign policy and on all legislative proposals the federal government intends to bring before parliament.\nHe added that Rule 15(5) of Rules of Business, 1973, also highlighted the responsibility of the prime minister, inter-alia, to furnish such information relating to the administration of affairs of the federation and proposals for legislation as the president may call for.\nThe president stated in the letter that elections of provincial assemblies, in case of their dissolution under Article 105 or Article 112, were required to be held within 90 days under Article 224 (2) of the Constitution.\nHe added that the Supreme Court had directed the ECP to propose date(s) to the president for holding the poll within 90 days or on a date that deviated to the barest minimum from the aforesaid deadline.\nHe said that the K-P governor was also directed by the Supreme Court to appoint a date for holding the general election for the provincial assembly of K-P as per above timeframe.\nSubsequently, the ECP had proposed holding of general elections between April 30 and May 7, 2023, and general elections for the Punjab Assembly on April 30, 2023, and the same was notified by the ECP.\nHuman right violations\nAdditionally, the president drew the PM\u2019s attention towards the human rights violation, saying events had taken place in the recent past that were highlighted by the print, electronic, and social media about glaring violations of fundamental and human rights that needed to be brought to the PM\u2019s notice to ensure remedial measures and preventive action.\nIn his letter, the president also drew the attention of the premier towards \u201cthe seriousness of incidents of human rights violations, atrocities of police and law enforcement agencies, and grossly disproportionate use of force against the citizens of Pakistan\u201d.\nHe said that multiple fake and frivolous cases had been registered against politicians, workers, journalists and media persons; houses of political workers had been raided, and citizens had been abducted without warrants and lawful justification.\nThe president termed the incidents of human rights violations and oppression by state machinery against innocent citizens as \u201cclear breach and violations of fundamental rights\u201d guaranteed by Article 4 of the Constitution, which provided for, and guaranteed citizens to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with the law.\nHe also referred to Article 9 on \u2018security of person\u2019, Article 10 on \u2018safeguards as to arrest and detention\u2019, Article 10-A on \u2018right to fair trial\u2019, Article 14 on \u2018inviolability of dignity of man etc\u2019, Article 15 on \u2018freedom of movement etc\u2019, Article 16 on \u2018freedom of assembly\u2019, Article 17 on \u2018freedom of association\u2019 and Article 19 on \u2018freedom of speech\u2019, saying that the spirit and mandate of these articles were being clearly transgressed.\n\u201cThis has tarnished the image of Pakistan in the international community and is casting negative repercussions on the future of democracy and state of human rights in Pakistan,\u201d he said, highlighting that Pakistan\u2019s ranking dropped 12 points downwards in the World Press Freedom Index, 2022.\nPakistan ranked 145 out of 180 countries, he said, which reflected the sorry state of affairs and this year\u2019s actions and images would further exacerbate Pakistan\u2019s already dismal ranking.\nECP apprises president\nThe Election Commission wrote a letter to President Alvi, in which he has taken into confidence over the postponement of the Punjab Assembly elections.\n"

Instead, she was murdered due to 'karo kari' and buried in secrecy.\nThatta SSP Adeel Chandio taking notice of the news ordered Sakro police station SHO Gul Hasan Kachar to investigate the matter.\nSubsequently, police claimed that Sahiba was killed by her two relatives Muhammad Chandio and Jan Muhammad Chandio. They had choked her to death and buried her at Shah Ismail Graveyard.\nPolice have arrested Muhamamd and Jan Muhammad under murder charges with the state as complainant. Despite efforts to root it out, the primitive practice of karo kari remains widespread in Sindh as well as other parts of the country.

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "Over a decade ago, getting around in Karachi in the dead of the night was considerably easy as multiple bus services would ply the port city\u2019s roads but not anymore.\nDuring the last 15 years, owing to factors like the rise of illegal rickshaws, high cost of diesel, and an increase in street crime, around 380 public transport routes have been closed in the city, as per a survey conducted by The Express Tribune. Among the routes that were discontinued, a significant number were used by public transport vehicles which would operate until 3am. At that time, the vehicles on the popular W-11 route would run round the clock.\nPresently, only one or two buses operate until 2am on the D-7 route. Vehicles on the popular W-11 route offer their services until 11pm.\nAmir Raza, who drives a bus on the W-11 route, when asked about route closures and the lack of public transport at night, replied: \u201cSome 280 vehicles used to ply the W-11 route round the clock until 2005. After that the public transport system went downhill.\u201d \nWhen asked about the reasons for the decline, Raza said that sky-high diesel prices, illegal Qingqi (pronounced chinchi locally) rickshaws operating on the same route, and a string of robberies in the buses resulted in transporters of the route going out of business.\nConsequently, the W-11 route\u2019s reputation as a reliable night-time route was ruined and now only about 80 vehicles operate on it, Raza continued.\nThe lower number of vehicles and operations closing early means that night shift workers like Najma Ahmed struggle to find a ride home. \u201cMy shift ends at 3am. In the past, I would use the buses which operated on the W-11 route. But now, I either have to take an expensive cab or wait for other nurses to get free so we can carpool,\u201d lamented Ahmed, who works as a nurse at the Civil Hospital in downtown Karachi.\nIt warrants mention that The Express Tribune\u2019s survey implies that the closure of routes and subsequent decline in number of transporters impacts many more like Ahmed. The survey reveals that for a city, whose headcount is upward of 17 million, the number of public transport vehicles is incredibly low. \nPrivate transporters operate about 3,000 to 4,000 buses, minibuses, and coaches. The government owned People\u2019s Bus Service operates 200 vehicles. Eighty buses operate under the Green Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and 20 buses are run on the Orange Line BRT.\nCommenting on the dearth of public transport vehicles and routes for one of the most populated cities in the world, an emphatic Irshad Bukhari, the president of Karachi Transport Ittehad, held the Sindh government responsible. \u201cThis governance failure is evidenced by the traffic police\u2019s failure to get illegal rickshaws off the roads. Moreover, the incompetence of the government in building infrastructure has also dented the public transport system,\u201d remarked Bukhari.\nAbdul Haleem Shaikh, the secretary at the transport department, does not agree with Bukhari\u2019s assessment. \u201cThe government is currently running the cheapest bus service in the province,\u201d he claimed.\nWhen quizzed about the lack of night-time routes, Shaikh retorted that the number of passengers late in the night was minimal. \u201cHence operating the buses at that time is not feasible,\u201d he justified. \nThe Express Tribune also questioned the secretary about the dearth of buses for the city\u2019s ever-increasing population. \u201cThe Red Line BRT project is under construction and will be a game changer for the city\u2019s people,\u201d he promised.\n"

Following a two-month training last October and November, a Chinese company donated a self-propelled corn harvester to MNSUAM and more modern machinery are yet to be introduced to Pakistan,\u201d Zhang told CEN.\nAnnually, an average of 512 local teachers, students, and users with bachelor\u2019s degree or above receive agricultural training, promoting mechanisation and technological innovation in Pakistan\u2019s agriculture sector.\nIn Pakistan, about three million young people enter the job market each year. But lack of access to technical training and the outdated training agenda are hindering them from landing a job and obstructing the agricultural and industrial modernisation.\nLuban Workshop is an international vocational education project initiated by China. Up to now, colleges in Tianjin have set up dozens of such workshops in 19 countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe, empowering local youth to learn state-of-the-art technologies and contribute to their country\u2019s development.\nThe article originally appeared on the China Economic Net\n\u00a0\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 24th, 2023.\n"

        },
        "Details": {
            "Text": "Pakistan is facing a sharp decline in cotton production as its per-acre yield has contracted to just half of the cotton productivity in regional countries.\nOwing to thin profit margins for cotton planting, farmers have switched over to other crops like rice, maize and sugarcane. Economic policymakers have expressed serious concern over the constant decline in cotton production over the years.\nIn a recent meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC), the policymakers and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar observed that the cotton sowing area was shrinking, which was a cause of concern for the government. Dar, who chairs the ECC meetings, pointed out that the per-acre cotton production in regional countries was double the per-acre harvest in Pakistan.\nIt was emphasised that the Ministry of National Food Security and Research would look into developing a support price mechanism in consultation with the Ministry of Industries and Production.\nThe ECC noted that for the cotton support price, the wheat and sugarcane model might be considered.\nCommerce Division secretary underlined the need for adopting international principles as well as undertaking a study on the comparative advantages of crops.\nThe Ministry of National Food Security recalled that the production of cotton, being the key crop in Pakistan\u2019s agricultural economy, reached the high of 14.1 million bales in the 2004-05 season. However, in later years, its harvest averaged around 12 million bales while in the last four years, the output dropped to 7 million bales in 2020-21 and about 9.45 million bales in 2021-22.\nMoreover, the unprecedented floods in 2022 significantly damaged the standing cotton crop, slashing overall production to a mere 4.76 million bales (according to cotton arrivals till March 3, 2023) against the target of 9 million bales.\nThe ministry stated that cotton production was decreasing and at the same time planting area was also shrinking. To meet the demand of textile industry, Pakistan has the potential to ramp up cotton production to 15 million bales in a short time span.\nIt was stated that the cotton price intervention policy during 2021-22 had resulted in price stability in the domestic market and higher investment in crop management, increasing production by 2 million bales despite a 7% decline in the cultivated area.\nSimilarly, the policy adopted in 2022-23 also ensured price stability in the domestic market. However, the unprecedented floods significantly damaged the standing crop.\nThe Ministry of National Food Security informed the ECC that in order to draw up a cotton intervention price proposal, consultations were held with all stakeholders including the provincial governments, growers and cotton associations in January and February 2023.\nGrowers proposed an intervention price of Rs7,000-8,000 per 40 kg.\nSince the last consultation on February 10, 2023, the cost of inputs had further increased. The revised average cost of production \u201cis now approximately Rs7,000 per 40 kg\u201d, the food ministry said.\nStakeholders, including the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, called for pegging the cotton intervention price with the import parity price in line with the policy adopted over the past two years. In a meeting convened at the Prime Minister\u2019s Office on March 13, 2023, the ministry said that it was decided to submit a summary, proposing cotton intervention price of Rs8,500 per 40 kg, for ECC\u2019s consideration.\nIt was emphasised that the announcement of intervention price ahead of the main sowing season would help growers decide on the planting area and investment in crop management. The proposed price was expected to help enhance yield and sowing area by 10-15%. The Ministry of National Food Security submitted following proposals for the ECC\u2019s consideration and approval.\nFix cotton (phutti) intervention price at Rs8,500 per 40 kg.\nConstitute a cotton price review committee with the mandate to review market prices and propose intervention on a fortnightly basis.\nProvinces or the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) should procure cotton lint (base grade-III with staple length of 1-1/32\u201d) from the pre-selected ginning factories.\nECC should advise TCP or provinces when to sell the procured cotton after assessing the local and international markets. Regularly monitor cotton prices in the main markets of Punjab and Sindh as well as in the international market and issue a brief price report at weekly intervals.\nWhen domestic prices of cotton (phutti) drop below the threshold of Rs8,500 per 40 kg, trigger the intervention price at a 10% discount to the estimated import parity price.\nThe ECC considered the summary titled \u201cCotton Intervention Price for 2023-24 Crop\u201d, submitted by the Ministry of National Food Security, and decided to set cotton (phutti) intervention price at Rs8,500 per 40 kg for the current crop.\nIt also constituted a cotton price review committee with the mandate to review market prices and propose intervention on a fortnightly basis.\nThe committee will regularly monitor cotton prices in the main markets of Punjab and Sindh as well as in the international market and issue a brief report at weekly intervals.\nThe ECC directed the Ministry of National Food Security to present a report on the deliberations held by the price review committee at the end of each month.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 24th, 2023.\n"

            "Text": "A woman sustained burn injuries after she came under an acid attack, police said.\nAccording to the police report, Mohammad Rizwan, a resident of Ward No. 12, Nankana, lodged a report with the police stating that suspects Arshad, a resident of Chak No. 70 GB, and Nazia Bibi, resident of Chak No. 225 RB, Ghaffari Town, allegedly armed with a pistol and carrying a bottle of acid arrived at the house of his sister, Farwa, and knocked at the door.\nHe said that his sister lived on the upper floor of the house with her nine-month-old son, Ibrahim, while Farwa\u2019s sister-in-law, Iqra Bibi, lived on the ground floor. \nMohammad Rizwan told the police that when his sister Iqra opened the door, the suspects hurtled towards his sister\u2019s room where Nazia allegedly threatened to kill his sister unless she gave them her gold ornaments. \nOut of fear, his sister handed the gold ornaments over to Nazia Bibi.\nNevertheless, Nazia Bibi threw acid on his sister\u2019s right cheek and lips, injuring her. \nHe told the police that when his sister raised an alarm, the suspects escaped.\nMohammad Rizwan said that his sister called 15, and police arrived at her house. \nThe complainant alleged that the sister-in-law of his sister had colluded with the suspects.\nThe D Type Colony Police Station registered a case against the suspects and mounted a search for them.\nIn June 2021, a young girl, who worked as a domestic help, was reportedly attacked with acid over refusal of a marriage proposal at Johar Town in Lahore.\nPolice had said that 27-year-old M, a permanent resident of Pakpattan, had moved to Lahore for work. She had been staying in Feroziyanwala Johar Town and worked a few miles away in Chungi Amar Sadu as a maid.\nOn the day of the incident, she was on her way to work in the Sui Gas Society in Chungi Amar Sadhu. Reportedly, two suspects, one of them identified as Ahmad Liaquat, a resident of Depalpur, Okara, intercepted her near Jagawar Chowk on a motorcycle. He approached her and forcefully insisted to drop her at her workplace. The victim refused the offer. The suspect carrying acid in a steel vessel poured it in her face.\nShe suffered burns on her hands, face and neck. She informed her family who took her to Lahore Jinnah Hospital for treatment.\nThe victim told the police that the suspect had been forcing her to marry him. However, she had refused. \u201c\u2019I will not leave you worthy of anything,\u2019 he had intimidated me,\u201d she told the police.\nThe brother of the victim, Waqar, had told The Express Tribune that the suspects had been harassing his sister for quite some time.

He announced financial assistance of Rs1 million for them. \nMeanwhile, Caretaker Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi felicitated the nation on Pakistan Day.\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, he said the day served as a solemn reminder of the unrelenting struggle and selfless sacrifices made by Muslims of the subcontinent towards attaining a separate homeland.\nThe nation had consistently displayed remarkable unity in the face of adversity and had emerged stronger from difficult situations, he added.

            "Text": "As the populace continues to grapple with the debilitating effects of inflation, political discontent and unemployment, a mental health crisis takes the only psychiatric facility in the province by storm.\nThe Punjab Institute of Mental Health (PIMH), which is one of the oldest and most prestigious psychiatric and rehabilitation facility in the country, in recent times has fallen under extreme stress given a paucity of resources and trained staff available for dealing with the rising number of mentally ill patients.\nAccording to sources, the passing years have witnessed a 30 to 50 per cent spike in the number of people requiring psychiatric attention, leading to an overburdening of the single psychiatric facility, which now receives a daily influx of up to 1,000 patients each day.\n\u201cThe Punjab Institute of Mental Health (PIMH) is the only public psychiatric hospital in the province, and it is severely lacking doctors, paramedics, and other medical paraphernalia,\u201d said Dr. Shakeel Ahmed Monga, executive director of PIMH. He further added, \u201cCurrently, half of the total 838 positions available for doctors, nurses and paramedics, remain vacant.\u201d\nThe fact that the under resourced facility is catering such a large flow of patients both in the out-patient department (OPD) and for hospitalization, is exacerbated by the revelation that many of the patients admitted into the hospital do not leave the premises even after completion of their treatment since most of them have been abandoned by their families. \nAccording to Dr. Monga, the low discharge rate of the hospital can be attributed to the fact that almost 300 patients are unable to provide any family contacts or address information, and thereby are accommodated in the facility, until any further details about their possible next of kin can be obtained.\n\u201cI have requested the government to assist us in searching for the family members and acquaintances of the abandoned patients, so that they can return to their homes and some of the burden on our facility can be relieved,\u201d informed Dr.Monga.\nThe fact that these neglected patients are overburdening the already exhausted medical resources is however, not the only dilemma, since keeping these patients in the premises of the hospital also means providing three to four meals a day to each of them, which is big blow to the budget. As Dr. Monga highlighted, \u201cThe total cost of serving breakfast, tea, lunch and dinner to each patient is Rs.300 daily, which is a lot, given our strained finances.\u201d\nWhile the presence of such a large number of patients does overburden the budget, Psychiatrist and Consultant at the Mental Hospital, Dr. Muhammad Waseem, highlights the dire need for these patients to be treated at the hospital instead of being sent back home.\n\u201cPatients with mental illnesses require constant care and attention, otherwise they risk harming themselves or others around. Therefore, we urge people to bring such patients immediately to the hospital, where we have a purpose built facility for dealing with them \u201crevealed Dr. Waseem.\nIndeed, the Mental Hospital acts as pseudo home for patients who occupy themselves by spending time in the in-built zoo, gym, and other recreational spaces.\nDr. Waseem concluded by emphasizing the need for more facilities to be dedicated to serving the mentally ill. \u201cToday, so many people are struggling with family issues, finances, jobs and many other problems. As a result, now more than ever, we need to invest in building an adequate number of mental health facilities,\u201d he said.\n"

He added those who had not yet received the coronavirus vaccine, could also submit the application.\n\u201cHowever, they will have the full dose of the vaccine and submit the certificate to the banks before their departure to Saudi Arabia. Apart from NADRA [National Database and Registration Authority], a foreign vaccine certificate would also be acceptable,\u201d he maintained.\nButt made it clear that it was not necessary for the person sending sponsorship to have a blood relation with the pilgrim. But, he added, it was essential to send the name, Computerised National Identity Card number, and contact number of the pilgrim along with the money, he added.\n"

Regarding that unfortunate development last week, we have expressed our concerns with the SCO and our point has been well registered with the entire organisation,\u201d she said while referring to the India cancelling the Pakistani invitation for a meeting of military experts on \u2018healthcare and pandemics\u2019.\n\u201cRegarding future meetings, I cannot predict how things would develop, but I can share with you that yesterday [Thursday] a delegation of Pakistan from the Joint Staff Headquarters attended the 16th meeting of the expert working group under the Council of the Ministers of Defence of SCO member states. It was a working level delegation that attended in-person,\u201d she added.\nThis was the first SCO meeting, where Pakistan attended the huddle in person.\nIt earlier attended the chief justices conference as well as the energy ministers meeting via video link.\nAlthough the final decision on the participation of Pakistan in the SCO defence and foreign ministers meetings has not been taken yet, Islamabad is actively considering the invitation.\nAs the SCO is a regional forum having China and Russia as its members too, one view within the Foreign Office is that Pakistan must not leave such key forums, allowing India an opportunity to score points.\nIndia is also scheduled to host a summit meeting in June.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is likely to be invited.\nIt is believed some friendly countries are making fresh efforts to open a channel of communications between Pakistan and India.\nHowever, because of the uncertain political situation in Pakistan, matters are not proceeding forward.\n"

            "Text": "A district and sessions court in Islamabad on Friday approved a one-day transit remand of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan\u2019s nephew and focal person Hassaan Khan Niazi to the Quetta police.\nAfter the transit remand was approved, Quetta police took Niazi to Balochistan.\nSources said that a case had been registered against Hassan Niazi at the Airport police station in Quetta for inciting violence and interfering in government affairs.\nQuetta police reached the district and session courts in Islamabad to arrest Hassan Niazi. Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah issued a warrant for Hassan Niazi's arrest. Later, Hassan Niazi was presented in court. Quetta police requested a one-day physical remand of Hassan Niazi, which the judicial magistrate accepted. After which, he was handed over to Quetta police.\nThe court told the Quetta police's investigation officer to present Hassan Niazi in the relevant court on March 25.\nOn March 18, a case was filed against Hassan Niazi at the Quetta Airport police station on charges of inciting violence and interfering with police affairs on a complaint of Inspector Abdulllah of the Airport police station in Quetta.\nThe case stated that while on patrol, the sub-inspector got the information that 150 people had blocked Chaman Road in Quetta, including Inayatullah Kakar and others. \nThe demonstrators blocked the road for one hour despite police\u2019s attempt to disperse them. It should be noted that Hassan Niazi was not nominated in the FIR by the Quetta police.\nQuetta police took custody of Hassan Khan Niazi and left for Balochistan after the judicial magistrate in Islamabad approved a one-day transit remand.\nNiazi was taken into custody by police outside the Judicial Complex in Islamabad on Monday for his involvement in attacking law enforcement personnel and causing chaos in the federal capital. The arrest is part of an ongoing crackdown on PTI activists and supporters who police claim assaulted law enforcers while they were performing their duties in Islamabad.\nOn Thursday, the district and sessions court in Islamabad sent Hassan Niazi to jail on a 14-day judicial remand in a case related to clashes between PTI workers and Islamabad police outside the Federal Judicial Complex during the court appearance of the former prime minister in the Toshakhana case.\nThe local court had rejected the police\u2019s plea seeking further physical remand of Hassan Niazi as the police failed to recover anything from the suspect during the investigation after taking him into custody.\nHassan Niazi was arrested in a separate case as he was leaving the Federal Judicial Complex after obtaining pre-arrest bail in three cases.\nOn Thursday, Hassan Niazi was produced in the court of Duty Magistrate Mureed Abbas in District and Sessions Court Islamabad after the expiry of his two-day physical remand.\nThe investigating officer pleaded to the court to grant a further five-day physical remand of Hassan Niazi. The investigating officer said that the co-accused has been identified while Hasan Niazi's arms and vehicle were to be recovered.\nThe PTI lawyers said that more than 72 hours had passed since his arrest but the police could not recover the (said) weapon.\nThe PTI counsel raised the question that if the arms and vehicle were not in possession of the police, then why have they detained Hassan Niazi?\nLawyer Faisal Chaudhry said that the police failed to trace the vehicle and its owner in the last 72 hours. He said that Hassan Niazi is a professional lawyer and he obtained three bails on the day of his arrest.\nAfter hearing the arguments of the parties, Duty Magistrate Mureed Abbas reserved the verdict on the plea for the extension in the physical remand of Hassan Niazi. Later, the court announced the reserved verdict, rejecting the police plea for further physical remand of Hassan Niazi. The court issued an order to send him to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.\n"

They said the distribution team fled the scene after the situation got worse. Eyewitnesses further said the police failed to show up on time.\nMeanwhile, the Saddar Beroni police said in a statement that they have launched an investigation into the incident and that culprits would be held to account soon. They said a preliminary investigation is being conducted using the mobile footage of the incident.\nAccording to SP Saddar Nabeel Khokhar, police personnel have been deployed at every location where free flour is being distributed. The police are ensuring the security of the freights.\nOn the other hand, the Punjab Food Authority (PFA) has said that it will launch a massive operation against people involved in adulterating milk, beverages, spices, ghee, cooking oil, and bakery items.\nAccording to sources, the police will collaborate with food safety teams to conduct the raids.\nThey said food safety teams have gathered information about bootleggers based in the garrison city.

The event could not be held after the outbreak of the coronavirus in 2020.\nSources confirmed that the festival was to be inaugurated on March 19 at 7 pm as per the schedule, but on March 18, the New Town Police Station Aizaz Azeem and his team raided the event on March 18, forcing the contractor to wrap up his belongings including equipment and the \u201cwell of death\u201d and flee.\n\u00a0Later, the PHA administration attempted to reopen the mela on March 21 but the contractor refused to come back with the entertainment equipment.\nAfter the contractor\u2019s refusal, the festival was cancelled and folk singers, who had been invited to the festival, were informed not to show up for the event. A Sufi night and a flower exhibition were also scheduled to be held but they had to be cancelled, the sources said.\nAccording to the sources, the New Town police registered a case and arrested around 18 employees working at the \u201cwell of death\u201d on charges of spreading nudity and obscenity.\nConfirming the cancellation of the mela, PHA spokesperson Naina Asharq said that the termination was a sad thing that it would provide good entertainment to the citizens and the best arrangements had been made.\nShe said that the contractor had made a lot of investment for the festival. The spokesperson denied that any obscenity was being spread saying it was pure entertainment.\nThe spokesperson also said that the rain also spoiled the event. She said that they will try to arrange the festival after Eid-ul-Fitr.\nShe said that earlier the coronavirus stopped them from holding the event and last year, the political situation of the city affected the festival.\n\u201cThis time around, the police raided and the rain did not allow the fair to take place. Preparations for this fair had been going on for a month-and-a-half,\u201d the PHA spokesperson said.\nMeanwhile, New Town SHO Aizaz Azeem said that the police duty officer was informed that gambling was under way at the well of death. He claimed that the gambling was going on despite a ban.\nHe said that Jashn-e-Baharan Mela should be held according to rules and a no-objection certificate should be obtained from all authorities concerned.\n\u201cHow can transgenders\u2019 dance and display of weapons be allowed in the name of Jashn-e-Baharan Mela,\u201d he said.\nWith the abrupt end of the festival, the citizens of Rawalpindi were once again deprived of entertainment.\nThe PHA had organised the festival at the Allama Iqbal Park Rawalpindi, where private companies had installed stalls of food and drink items.\n"

            "Text": "While most would expect classical educational institutions to act as torch bearers for the advancement of the nation, the deplorable state of affairs at the Islamia Colleges in the provincial capital, presents a gloomy picture.\nEstablished in the 20th century in Peshawar, the Islamia College, had historically played a key role in advancing the Independence movement in the subcontinent and had also nurtured the political ethos of various ruling elites in the early years of Pakistan. Concurrently, its daughter institution, the Jamia Usmania, known popularly as the \u201cmother of knowledge\u201d, was also widely revered for having produced many accomplished alumni, who dutifully served the nation.\nIn recent times however, the two institutions have caught the public eye for all the wrong reasons. With regular student and faculty protests, frequent robberies and occasional murders, the colleges have lost their appeal to prospective students and have, in no time, turned into sites of widespread social chaos.\n\u201cThe good reputation of the Islamia College has long gone\u201d, resented Izhar Ullah, a senior alumni. \u201cGiven daily protests, student clashes and crime occurrences, regular classes no longer take place. If the current situation persists, soon enough no parent would want to send their child for studying here,\u201d he added.\nAccording to the President of the Peshawar University Teachers Association, Dr Muhammad Uzair, poor administrative structures and inadequate vigilance are paramount factors behind the worsening law and order atmosphere on the campuses. \u201cThe administration does not monitor the conduct of classes nor does it guarantee the availability of the 350 members of the teaching faculty,\u201d said Uzair. \u201cNor does the vigilance invest in installing modern surveillance equipment, like security cameras, in order to keep check on student activity and curb the crime rate,\u201d he added.\nApart from this, Uzair also cited meagre salaries of the teaching faculty as being a major factor behind regular faculty-led protests.\nWhile some blame the administration for the deteriorating state of affairs, others cite nepotism in the government as being another major cause. As Shah Nawaz, a teacher at the Islamia College and member of the Islamia College Teachers Association, told The Express Tribune, \u201cThe government appoints the Vice Chancellor of the Islamia College based on its preferences and personal favorites and seldom takes into account the qualifying credentials of the appointee.\u201d\nFurthermore, Nawaz, revealed that majority of the appointed administration is from far flung areas and is ill-prepared for dealing with the local realities on campus. He also highlighted the recent murders on campus as being another factor contributing to the rising notoriety of the institution.\nIndeed, the recent ironic murder of a professor by a security guard at the Islamia College and the murder of a security personnel at the Jamia Usmania, were moments of immense agitation among the student body and the alumni, who urged the government to take swift action against the perpetrators of the mayhem.\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune on the matter, Khan Zaman, the President of the Islamia College Senior Alumni Association, nostalgically recalled times which were much more peaceful and prosperous, and simultaneously urged the relevant stakeholders to play their part in reinstating order. \u201cThe government, administration, faculty and students, must collectively work towards restoring the prestige and repute of these historical institutions,\u201d concluded Zaman.\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 25th, 2023.\n"

            "Text": "The Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) and the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Peshawar have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in a bid to further improve industry-academia linkages.\nAccording to a statement issued here on Friday, a signing ceremony was held at the chamber\u2019s house in which SCCI President Muhammad Ishaq and Director Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialisation (ORIC) UET Peshawar Dr Nasru Minallah inked the MoU.\nSenior SCCI Advisory Committee member Dr Khalid Khan, Manager University Industry Linkage, UET Dr Tariq Khalil, Office Manager Dr Jawad Ali Shah and others were present.\nIshaq termed the signing of the MoU with UET a milestone step towards strengthening industry-academia linkages, saying the SCCI started a series of MoUs with public and private sector universities.\nHe elaborated that the MoU aimed at equipping graduates and young students with technical skills besides the completion of their academic pursuits so that it would enable them to get instant employment opportunities.\nThe SCCI president apprised the meeting that the chamber had recently inked a memorandum of corporation (MoC) with the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Tevta) under German Organisation (GIZ) Tevta Support Programme.\nUnder the GIZ Tevta Support Programme, he said, the SCCI and Tevta would jointly conduct capacity building and job training sessions to bring improvement in youths/graduates skills and ensure their job placement in various trade organisations and industries.\nTalking about the SCCI 2.0 programme, Ishaq informed that the chamber was going to launch this programme very shortly, which was the first-ever initiative taken by the SCCI in Pakistan under which the chamber would be developed on modern lines by equipping it with complete digitisation and bringing it up to modern standards.\nThe SCCI chief said there was a lack of entrepreneurship in the province, saying: \u201cOur youth is highly skillful and capable to excel in every field.\u201d\nHe, however, said there was a need to provide youth with a proper platform to utilise their abilities efficiently and continue playing a role in the country\u2019s economic prosperity and progress.\nOn the current state of Pakistan\u2019s economy, Ishaq said the industries and businesses were in severe crisis owing to multiple reasons and inconsistent policies.\nThe SCCI president informed that currently industries were working 10 to 20 per cent of their installed capacity under the prevailing circumstances.\nIshaq remarked immense natural and mineral reserves existed in K-P, in which gemstone, mining, and marble were at the top.\nHe added that the SCCI had taken initiatives for promotion of the gemstone sector. The SCCI chief called for tapping natural reserves and resources in an efficient manner to bring economic stability and improvement.\nEarlier, ORIC UET Peshawar Director Minallah and Manager University Industry Linkage, UET Peshawar Khalil briefed the chamber president regarding various projects that were initiated by their department.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "The construction of the Koto Power Plant in Lower Dir district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) has entered the final stages of completion.\nAfter successful completion at the end of this year, the project will start producing 40.8 megawatts of cheap electricity, which will bring more than Rs2 billion to the provincial exchequer annually and create new employment opportunities in the province.\nIt will help overcome the energy crisis too in the province.\nThis was stated by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization (PEDO) Engr Naeem Khan during his surprise visit to the project site on Friday.\nHe was accompanied by Deputy Commissioner Lower Dir Iftikhar Khan Marwat. He reviewed progress of work on the dam and various parts of the project.\nAbout the ongoing construction work, Deputy Director Engineer Muqeemuddin said that due to security reasons, several workers of the team of Chinese engineers working on the project had left their work and went back to their home country, while during the Covid-19 emergency, it proved very difficult to bring machinery for the project as there was a global lockdown.\nDue to these reasons, the project work was slightly delayed but they were trying their level best to catch up.\n\u201cAfter the security situation improved, now the Chinese staff is back and work has been once again in progress with full pace and the required heavy machinery had also been brought to the site,\u201d he maintained, adding that there were some difficulties in acquiring land for the project and it was another cause of delay, on which Deputy Commissioner Iftikhar Khan assured the project officials that discussions were in progress with the local people regarding the purchase of land and payments to the landowners would be made soon.\nEng Naeem Khan, while expressing satisfaction over the pace of work on the project, directed the field staff that the pace of work on the project should be increased so that the people can benefit from the project soon.\nIt is worth mentioning here that Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to restart construction work on the Lawi Hydropower Project in Chitral district that had been stopped due to some security and financial issues.\nA financial package has also been announced and security issues have been resolved to ensure speedy work on the project.\nSimilarly, the World Bank (WB) will fund two hydropower projects of 245 megawatts in Swat this year, the completion of which will bring an annual income of more than Rs13 billion to the province.\nThe WB will lend money to the K-P government for this purpose.\nIn October last year, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of Secretary Energy and Power Nisar Ahmad Khan, with the project directors of WB regarding progress on both the projects.\nThe WB will fund the projects as part of the development energy sector including the 157 MW Madyan Hydropower Project and 88 MW Gabral Kalam Hydropower Project.\nIn this regard, a $450 million agreement has been signed between the WB and the provincial government.\n\u00a0\n"

            "Text": "The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Saturday approached the Supreme Court against the Election Commission of Pakistan\u2019s decision to delay election in Punjab.\nThe party maintained that the ECP\u2019s move \u201cis in violation of the Constitution as well as the apex court order\u201d.\nThe Supreme Court registrar office allotted a number to the PTI petition, without raising any objection.\nThe PTI petition added that the party has approached the SC as \u201cthe matter involved in the petition is of public importance with reference to enforcement of fundamental rights of the millions of people of Pakistan, particularly the people of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P)\u201d.\nThe move came after the electoral watchdog in a surprising development delayed the election in Punjab till Oct 8 on the grounds that it could not conduct transparent and peaceful polls on the scheduled date of April 30.\nIt said that the elections could not be held in Punjab under the circumstances conveyed to it by the law enforcement agencies, finance, defence, and interior ministries as well as Punjab chief secretary and others, who all opposed the polls on various grounds.\nSubsequently, the ECP withdrew its notification regarding the elections in Punjab, postponing the voting for the provincial assembly until Oct 8, adding that a fresh election schedule would be announced in due course.\nMeanwhile, in a separate constitutional petition, former Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Zafar Ali Shah asserted that the Election Commission's notification of March 22 was illegal and unconstitutional. Zafar requested the apex court to take action under Article 6 against those who had violated the court's decision, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Rana Sanaullah and caretaker Punjab Chief Minister Mohsin Naqvi.\nAdditionally, Zafar urged that the chief election commissioner be removed from office while directing the Election Commission to hold the election according to the original April 30 schedule.\nFurther, Advocate GM Chaudhry submitted a third contempt of court petition in the SC, arguing that Prime Minister Shehbaz, the CEC, and the caretaker CM had failed to discharge their duties.\nChaudhry claimed that the prime minister and CM Naqvi were releasing funds for vested interests, while funds were also being allocated for development projects.\nThe petitioner also drew attention towards the statements made by the prime minister and federal ministers indicating an intention to delay elections.\nChaudhry requested that strict action should be taken against those who had violated the SC orders.\nFinally, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid's lawyer Azhar Siddique submitted the fourth contempt of court petition in the top court on behalf of his client.\nA constitutional petition was filed with the SC, bringing to light the pressing issue of delay in elections of the Punjab and K-P assemblies, as well as the recent announcement by the ECP of holding the elections on Oct 8.\nThe petitioners were Punjab Assembly Speaker Muhammad Sibtain Khan, K-P Assembly Speaker Mushtaq Ahmed Ghani, and PTI Secretary General Asad Umar, who sought intervention of the court in this critical matter.\nThe petition cites the SC orders, which were issued on March 1, 2023, to the president and K-P governor to announce the date for the elections of the Punjab and K-P assemblies.\nAccording to the Constitution, the elections were to be held within 90 days after the dissolution of these assemblies. However, the petitioners pointed out that the Punjab Assembly was dissolved on January 14, 2023, while the K-P Assembly on January 18, and thus, this 90-day window had lapsed.\n"

        "Details": {
            "Text": "Despite it having hopes of forming an independent government at the centre, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) has not made any effort to attract voters in provinces other than Punjab; even when its popularity has been dented by a resurgent Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). \nFor the past decade, the PML-N\u2019s laser focus on Punjab has resulted in it ceding valuable political space to other political parties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Balochistan, Sindh, Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B), and Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK). While the party may still have a political presence in the other provinces, in Sindh it has next to no political clout left - evidenced by the fact that it has no national or provincial assembly representatives from the province and only managed to bag 7 Union Council seats from Karachi in the recently held local bodies elections. However, senior journalist and political analyst, Mazhar Abbas, feels that the PML-N\u2019s focus on Punjab at the expense of becoming irrelevant in other provinces is a carefully thought out party policy. \u201cPunjab is mini-Pakistan, so parties like the PML-N and now the PTI know they only have to carve out big wins in the province to form a government in the centre,\u201d he opined. \u201cAs far as the PML-N is concerned, ever since Maryam Nawaz has been appointed Chief Organiser, she has not come out of Punjab, which means that the PML-N is content with being a provincial party.\u201d \nAbbas feels that the strategy adopted by Maryam Nawaz, wherein she is fixated on one province, is against the spirit of politics. \u201cThere is a huge political vacuum in Sindh as a vast majority of the populace is not happy with the performance of the incumbent Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government. Hence, the PML-N leadership should focus on re-organising their party in Sindh, so they can pick up valuable national or provincial assembly seats,\u201d the veteran journalist suggested. \nHowever, the infighting in the PML-N\u2019s Sindh chapter, which resulted in an attack by some party workers on the Muslim League House at Karsaz, makes it unlikely that the party will heed to the political analyst\u2019s advice. \u201cKarachi based party leaders are not happy with the appointment of Shah Mohammad Shah as the Sindh chapter\u2019s President,\u201d informed a senior PML-N leader, on the condition of anonymity. \u201cEven though Shah was elected unopposed back in 2018; after his election it has been hard to convene the provincial chapter\u2019s meetings and to evolve consensus on political activities,\u201d the PML-N leader added. \nWhen asked about the infighting in the party\u2019s Sindh chapter, Sorath Thebo, Additional Joint Secretary of PML-N Sindh, did not acknowledge that there were any differences. She was of the view that the party\u2019s suppression during the General Musharraf era was to blame for its current lack of political clout in Sindh. \u201cOur leadership has been dealing with politically motivated cases for years now. If our entire energy is invested in defending ourselves in court, how will we spare time for political activism in the province?\u201d retorted Thebo, while talking to The Express Tribune.\n\u00a0\n"

However, police shifted the body to the Dr Ruth KM Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for medico-legal formalities.\nAbdul Samad\u2019s parents told the police that the children were involved in a role-playing game where the boy played a cow while his younger sister used a dupatta as rope to lead him around. The two played the game during the sunrise meal of sehri during Ramazan.\nPolice sources said that the family wasn\u2019t forthcoming regarding details as to why none of the elders came to the rescue of the child or why the younger sister didn\u2019t alert the rest of the family. \nThe sources claimed that the Brigade police station SHO Agha Mushtaq Ali had tried to stop the post-mortem from taking place. However, Jamshed Town SP Zubair Tanoli and Ferozabad DSP Ahsan Zulfiqar ordered a full investigation and autopsy.\n"

            "Text": "The Sindh High Court (SHC) instructed the Sindh police chief to take action against police highhandedness with citizens while hearing a petition of Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh.\nA two-member bench headed by Justice Muhammad Iqbal Kalhoro heard the case related to the provision of security to Sheikh as opposition leader.\nDuring the hearing, Justice Kalhoro observed that police and private guards misbehave with citizens on the roads. Is this a security state or a welfare state, the jurist remarked. \nJustice Kalhoro verbally instructed the IGP to conduct an awareness campaign and adopt measures to bring an end to this culture. Karachi is notorious for menacing guards or policemen sitting in the backseat of a vehicle flinging their weapons asking drivers to either make way or steer clear. \nJustice Kalhoro, in a conversation with SSP Security, said that the squad accompanying police officers also misbehaved with citizens. Civilians are rudely ordered to move aside, he remarked.\nHe then added that the security provided to judges was inadequate, remarking that some of those don't even know how to use a gun. The court remarked that the policemen provided to judges for security were often those nearing retirement. \nAll the commandos are in the squad of police officers, Justice Kalhoro remarked. \nHe observed that landlords (waderas) had private security, who also made gestures like policemen. Who will stop all these actions, he inquired. \nOpposition leader\nWhile hearing about Sheikh's counsel about his concerns over security, the judge remarked that he could afford to hire guards.\nThe lawyer argued that security was the right of the opposition leader in law. He added that 31 cases were registered against his client. \nJustice Kalhoro told the lawyer not to waste the court's time with such details and tell it what the law states on the issue. \nThe SSP told the court that there was shortage of police personnel and they could not provide security to Sheikh, who is a member of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. \nThe court told the two parties to find a solution while hiring private guards in the interim. Shaikh told the court that the rules of the Sindh Assembly have a provision on security. The court instructed Shaikh's lawyers to provide details while adjourning the hearing till March 30. \nThe application states that opposition leader is the most important position after that of chief minister. It contends that Shaikh has not been provided adequate security. It adds that Shaikh's life in danger while seeking increasing security.\n"
