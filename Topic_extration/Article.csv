"LAHORE: The Punjab prosecution department on Saturday filed a state appeal before the Supreme Court’s Lahore registry, challenging the acquittal of the sole convict in the murder case of social media sensation Qandeel Baloch.
The Lahore High Court’s Multan bench had on Feb 14 acquitted Mohammad Waseem, the brother of Qandeel, of the charges, setting aside his life imprisonment handed down by a trial court in 2019 under Section 311 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The state appeal filed by Additional Prosecutor General Khurram Khan argues that the LHC did not appreciate the law and the facts of the case in its true perspective while allowing the appeal of the convict.
It says the acquittal of the convict in the case is a miscarriage of justice.
The appeal argues that the confessional statement of the convict under Section 164 CrPC was quite convincing, but the LHC discarded it on the basis of mere technicalities and assumptions.
It states that the observations made by the court in the impugned judgement with respect to the confession are against the law of the land and not sustainable in the eye of law.
The appeal contends that in this era of scientific evidence, the bench ignored the matching DNA reports of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) which establish the case of the prosecution from all corners.
It says the death of Qandeel occurred in the house of her parents and according to Section 122 of the Qanoon-i-Shahadat Order, 1984, the burden is shifted on the accused to establish his non-involvement in the crime.
It argues that the reports of the items of DNA collected from near the body of the deceased confirmed the presence of the convict on the crime scene and his involvement in the murder of his sister.
The appeal argues that a bare perusal of the evidence produced in the court and circumstances of the case make it a classic case of “honour killing” which falls within the ambit of Section 311 PPC (Fasad-fil-Arz).
It further argues that the appellate court did not consider the polygraph test which was very strong evidence against the accused.
The prosecution states that the LHC acted against the law by acquitting the convict on the basis of compromise without summoning the list of legal heirs of the deceased.
It says the deceased had a minor son and the court, while allowing the appeal of the convict, did not safeguard the rights of the minor in the case.
The appeal asks the apex court to set aside the judgement of the LHC and restore the sentence of the convict awarded by the trial court.
Justice Sohail Nasir of the LHC had allowed the appeal of Waseem after finding grave illegalities made by the judicial magistrate concerned while recording the judicial confession.
The judge, in his judgement, observed, “Once the evidence of confession is discarded, there is no other material at all with the prosecution to establish that it was a case of honour killing”.
The judge observed, “I am conscious of the fact that a famous celebrity of the country lost her life without any sin but this fact alone is not relevant to sustain the conviction of appellant for the reasons that the courts have to decide cases in accordance with law”.

"ISLAMABAD: The Sup­reme Court on Saturday sought assistance from six political parties including the proponents of the no-trust motion in the National Assembly against Prime Minister Imran Khan and ordered the Islamabad police chief to come up with a comprehensive report regarding Friday’s breaching of Sindh House by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists. 
In an unusual sitting, a two-judge SC bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Muneeb Akhtar issued notices to the ruling PTI, Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl), Balochistan National Party (Mengal) and the Awami National Party through their respective secretary generals, though they will be represented by their legal counsel. 
The court also issued notices to the respondents for their assistance in ensuring a smooth, lawful and peaceful completion of the process under Article 95 of the constitution. 
The federal government through interior and defence secretaries, the prime minister, leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, National Assembly speaker and secretary, Islamabad chief commissioner and deputy commissioner and Inspector General of Police are respondents in the case. 

Reference under Article 63-A to be taken up alongside SCBA plea

Earlier, the case was fixed for Monday, March 21. But the court preferred to take up the matter on Saturday — a day when usually benches don’t sit to hear cases, though former CJP Saqib Nisar used to hear cases on weekends too. 
CJP Bandial emphasised that political activities should be held within the confines of the law and the Constitution instead of creating ‘anarchic’ situation. Hurling threats to state institutions or damaging public properties was not acceptable, he observed. 
Referring to Article 95 of the Constitution, which deals with the no-confidence motion, the SC described it as a non-legal matter that did not relate to the jurisdiction of the apex court.
“With respect to the proceedings under Article 95 being conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the law, except the incident of the Friday last — when a group of charged PTI activists breached the Sindh House twice — presently there is nothing before us that invites our attention either in the public interest or on account of the violation of the constitutional principles,” the CJP remarked while dictating the orders after the hearing. 
The Supreme Court had taken up a petition moved by the Supreme Court Bar Association – an apex legal forum – instituted to seek a restraining order against government’s “intentions” of preventing the parliamentarians from taking part in the no-trust motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, Additional Interior Secretary Mohammad Ayub, IGP Ahsan Younus, Additional Advocate General for Sindh Rafiq Rajorvi were present in the courtroom No 1. 
While pointing towards senior counsel for SCBA Mansoor Usman Awan, the bench explained that the SC was hearing the petition of the bar and did not take any suo motu notice on the matter. Mr Awan sought a direction from the apex court to all the state functionaries to act strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the law by restraining them from acting in any manner detrimental to and unwarranted by the Constitution and the law. 
Reference under Article 63-A
Also, the attorney general apprised the apex court that the federal government was filing a reference under Article 186 of the Constitution, seeking delineation of the scope and meaning of certain provisions contained in Article 63-A of the Constitution. 
The CJP, however, observed that the court would take up matter only when it came before the court, but regretted whatever happened on Friday was “beyond the right of freedom of expression and lawful protest”. 
The AGP also tried to explain factors behind the violent protest, recalled how some lawmakers had been “placed” at Sindh House, and alleged that this reflected a return to the old menace of horse trading.  
The bench, however, observed that the SCBA had approached the court in aid of public interest to assure that the rights of the parliamentarians were exercised in accordance with the Constitution and the law. 
The AGP then assured the court about federal government’s commitment to the process under Article 95 of the Constitution to be followed strictly in accordance with the law. He expressed deep regret on behalf of the federal government about the events that took place on Friday evening and affirmed government’s resolve for the law to take its course with respect to the offences that were committed during the incident. 
The court then postponed further proceedings for Monday with the observation that if any reference was filed, it would also be taken along with the SCBA plea.

JEN Psaki

 
WASHINGTON: The Biden administration has indicated its desire to continue a careful engagement with Pakistan without committing to either improving or degrading ties with a country that was once a close ally.
The indication came at a Friday afternoon news briefing at the White House when Press Secretary Jen Psaki ignored two provocative questions that she could have used to either criticise Pakistan’s current policies or to underline the US desire to repair ties with Islamabad.
A Pakistani journalist reminded her that many, many months ago Prime Minister Imran Khan had “requested a telephone conversation” with US President Joe Biden. “We haven’t heard anything about that. Is there a specific reason for not communicating with the Pakistani leadership?” the journalist asked.
“I don’t have any update on a planned call or engagement. Obviously, we engage with Pakistan and a range of leaders at a number of levels through the State Department, through our national security team,” the White House press secretary replied. “But in terms of a call or engagement with the president, I don’t have anything to predict on that front.”

When asked about Biden-Imran phone call, White House says it has no knowledge of that

The journalist then reminded Ms Psaki that Prime Minister Khan said at recent a public gathering that “he will not be a slave of America like other (Pakistani) politicians”.
“Would you like to comment on that?” he asked.
“We have a long relationship with Pakistan, and that is a relationship we’ll continue through diplomatic channels. So, I don’t have any more comments on that,” Ms Psaki responded.
Last month, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing that the United States still considered Pakistan a strategic partner and Islamabad does not need to strain its relations with Beijing to maintain ties with Washington.
“Pakistan is a strategic partner of the United States. We have an important relationship with the government in Islamabad, and it’s a relationship that we value across a number of fronts,” he said.
Pakistan was a close US ally during the cold war and remained so till the collapse of the Soviet Union. Pakistan played a key role in the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan and partnered with the United States in the war against terrorism as well.
The relationship started to sour when Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found in Abbottabad and the Obama administration took him out without informing Islamabad.
In July 2019, Prime Minister Khan made an “official working” visit to Washington where he met the then president Donald Trump at the White House. He had another meeting with Mr Trump in New York during the UN General Assembly in September 2019.
Since then, there has been no face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the two countries and President Biden is yet to make a courtesy call to the Pakistani prime minister.

"ISLAMABAD: Hours after threatening to take the extreme step of disrupting the all-important meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) in case National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser did not put the no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan on the day’s agenda by Monday (tomorrow), the joint opposition toned down its stance by stressing that Pakistan’s political turmoil will not be allowed to affect the event in any way.
Though the opposition did not make a categorical announcement withdrawing its threat to stage a sit-in inside the National Assembly, the venue of the OIC event, it assured the foreign ministers of the Muslim countries that upon their arrival and during their stay in Islamabad, “a conducive atmosphere in accordance with the traditional spirit of hospitality, respect and zeal would be ensured”.
The assurance was given by the joint opposition through a statement released to the media on Saturday night by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb, around five hours after the opposition leaders’ press conference where they had announced staging a sit-in inside the National Assembly hall ahead of the OIC meeting, if the speaker did not include the resolution on the agenda of the sitting to be called on Monday (tomorrow).
The threat had been hurled by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and was immediately endorsed by PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif. Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) president Maulana Fazlur Rehman and chief of his own faction of Balochistan National Party (BNP), Akhtar Mengal, were also present.

Leaders had warned of sit-in in NA if no-trust move not placed on agenda

The joint opposition, however, in its statement later said it would warmly welcome the foreign ministers, delegates and other dignitaries of the Islamic world to Pakistan on the occasion of the 48th meeting of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers, adding “the arrival of distinguished guests is a source of joy and pride for us”.
“The opposition pledges to do its utmost to create an atmosphere in which the distinguished guests will be able to carry out their activities with full attention, dedication and determination,” said the statement.
Bilawal’s clarification
Later, Zulfikar Ali Bader, the spokesperson for Bilawal, also issued a clarification of sorts, declaring the PPP chairman was not against the OIC meeting, “but against the government’s escape from the no-confidence motion”.
“If the NA speaker delays the no-confidence motion under the guise of the OIC meeting, then there will be a reaction,” he said.
Mr Bader said PM Khan wanted to postpone the no-confidence motion till April under the garb of the OIC conference “but we will not allow Imran Khan to do so”.
Sources in the opposition told Dawn that after their news conference, their leadership met again and reviewed their announcement after receiving a reaction, not only from the government, but also from some public and other circles, as there was a general view that any attempts to disrupt the OIC event would bring a bad name to the country.
Earlier, during the news conference, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had stated that if the speaker did not introduce the no-confidence resolution in the assembly immediately after offering fateha (for a deceased PTI MNA) on Monday (tomorrow) then “my plea to my own party and the opposition parties will be that we will not leave the hall”.
“We will see how you will organise the OIC meeting,” he had stated about the gathering for which even the corps commanders in their last meeting had declared that it would be provided complete security and protection.
The PPP chairman’s remarks were endorsed by Mr Sharif, who said if the speaker did not run the house after offering prayers, “we will be compelled to stage a sit-in inside the assembly hall”.
The threats from the opposition had come amid reports that the government was planning to call the assembly session on Monday afternoon (tomorrow) on the requisition of the opposition, and that the speaker would adjourn it for three to four days due to Pakistan Day and OIC meetings after offering fateha for the departed soul of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) MNA from Hangu Khayal Zaman.
Parliamentary tradition
As per parliamentary tradition, the House does not take up any agenda on the first sitting held after the death of any member. Since this will be the first sitting after Mr Zaman’s death, it is expected the speaker may announce a prolonged adjournment after offering fateha.
Moreover, there are reports the government is planning to file a reference before the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday morning seeking interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution regarding disqualification of MNAs, and that the speaker may give a ruling during the sitting that since the matter is pending before the apex court, he could not put the no-trust resolution to vote.
Under Article 95 of the Constitution, the speaker cannot put a no-confidence resolution for a vote before three days and after seven days of its presentation before the House. The speaker, however, is bound to convene the assembly session by Monday, as the opposition had submitted the requisition notice to the National Assembly Secretariat on March 8, and he could not delay calling the session beyond 14 days.
Parliamentary history showed that the Lower House of parliament had on a number of occasions ignored the tradition of adjourning a sitting without taking up any agenda item due to the death of an MNA when something important was on the day’s plan. One such occasion came up on June 22, 2012 during the PPP government, when the National Assembly session had been convened for the election of a new prime minister after disqualification of Yousuf Raza Gilani. It was the first sitting of the House after the death of PPP MNA Fauzia Wahab, who had died on June 17.
The then speaker, Dr Fehmida Mirza -- now an ally of the PTI government -- had ignored the calls of the opposition to adjourn the sitting, and allowed the members to continue the election process after PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar argued that since it was not a regular session, therefore, the tradition should be ignored and voting allowed.
Interestingly, the plea to adjourn the sitting had been made by Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
During the presser on Saturday, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had said they also wanted the OIC meeting to take place. But, he said, “the only way for it to happen without any problems is that the speaker plays his due role”.
“He (the speaker) should think about the country, democracy and the OIC,” Bilawal stressed.
“If he begins the no-confidence proceedings on Monday, there would be no issues in the way of the OIC and we, too, will not have any objections,” he added.
Shehbaz Sharif said those coming to attend the OIC meeting were the guests of the nation. “But we will not allow you to go against the law and Constitution under the garb of this [OIC conference]. We will stage a sit-in then,” he had declared.

It argues that the reports of the items of DNA collected from near the body of the deceased confirmed the presence of the convict on the crime scene and his involvement in the murder of his sister.
The appeal argues that a bare perusal of the evidence produced in the court and circumstances of the case make it a classic case of “honour killing” which falls within the ambit of Section 311 PPC (Fasad-fil-Arz).
It further argues that the appellate court did not consider the polygraph test which was very strong evidence against the accused.
The prosecution states that the LHC acted against the law by acquitting the convict on the basis of compromise without summoning the list of legal heirs of the deceased.
It says the deceased had a minor son and the court, while allowing the appeal of the convict, did not safeguard the rights of the minor in the case.
The appeal asks the apex court to set aside the judgement of the LHC and restore the sentence of the convict awarded by the trial court.
Justice Sohail Nasir of the LHC had allowed the appeal of Waseem after finding grave illegalities made by the judicial magistrate concerned while recording the judicial confession.
The judge, in his judgement, observed, “Once the evidence of confession is discarded, there is no other material at all with the prosecution to establish that it was a case of honour killing”.
The judge observed, “I am conscious of the fact that a famous celebrity of the country lost her life without any sin but this fact alone is not relevant to sustain the conviction of appellant for the reasons that the courts have to decide cases in accordance with law”.

 questions need to call Sindh police for Sindh House protection...
"ISLAMABAD: The Sup­reme Court on Saturday sought assistance from six political parties including the proponents of the no-trust motion in the National Assembly against Prime Minister Imran Khan and ordered the Islamabad police chief to come up with a comprehensive report regarding Friday’s breaching of Sindh House by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists. 
In an unusual sitting, a two-judge SC bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Muneeb Akhtar issued notices to the ruling PTI, Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl), Balochistan National Party (Mengal) and the Awami National Party through their respective secretary generals, though they will be represented by their legal counsel. 
The court also issued notices to the respondents for their assistance in ensuring a smooth, lawful and peaceful completion of the process under Article 95 of the constitution. 
The federal government through interior and defence secretaries, the prime minister, leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, National Assembly speaker and secretary, Islamabad chief commissioner and deputy commissioner and Inspector General of Police are respondents in the case. 

Reference under Article 63-A to be taken up alongside SCBA plea

Earlier, the case was fixed for Monday, March 21. But the court preferred to take up the matter on Saturday — a day when usually benches don’t sit to hear cases, though former CJP Saqib Nisar used to hear cases on weekends too. 
CJP Bandial emphasised that political activities should be held within the confines of the law and the Constitution instead of creating ‘anarchic’ situation. Hurling threats to state institutions or damaging public properties was not acceptable, he observed. 
Referring to Article 95 of the Constitution, which deals with the no-confidence motion, the SC described it as a non-legal matter that did not relate to the jurisdiction of the apex court.
“With respect to the proceedings under Article 95 being conducted in accordance with the Constitution and the law, except the incident of the Friday last — when a group of charged PTI activists breached the Sindh House twice — presently there is nothing before us that invites our attention either in the public interest or on account of the violation of the constitutional principles,” the CJP remarked while dictating the orders after the hearing. 
The Supreme Court had taken up a petition moved by the Supreme Court Bar Association – an apex legal forum – instituted to seek a restraining order against government’s “intentions” of preventing the parliamentarians from taking part in the no-trust motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, Additional Interior Secretary Mohammad Ayub, IGP Ahsan Younus, Additional Advocate General for Sindh Rafiq Rajorvi were present in the courtroom No 1. 
While pointing towards senior counsel for SCBA Mansoor Usman Awan, the bench explained that the SC was hearing the petition of the bar and did not take any suo motu notice on the matter. Mr Awan sought a direction from the apex court to all the state functionaries to act strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the law by restraining them from acting in any manner detrimental to and unwarranted by the Constitution and the law. 
Reference under Article 63-A
Also, the attorney general apprised the apex court that the federal government was filing a reference under Article 186 of the Constitution, seeking delineation of the scope and meaning of certain provisions contained in Article 63-A of the Constitution. 
The CJP, however, observed that the court would take up matter only when it came before the court, but regretted whatever happened on Friday was “beyond the right of freedom of expression and lawful protest”. 
The AGP also tried to explain factors behind the violent protest, recalled how some lawmakers had been “placed” at Sindh House, and alleged that this reflected a return to the old menace of horse trading.  
The bench, however, observed that the SCBA had approached the court in aid of public interest to assure that the rights of the parliamentarians were exercised in accordance with the Constitution and the law. 
The AGP then assured the court about federal government’s commitment to the process under Article 95 of the Constitution to be followed strictly in accordance with the law. He expressed deep regret on behalf of the federal government about the events that took place on Friday evening and affirmed government’s resolve for the law to take its course with respect to the offences that were committed during the incident. 
The court then postponed further proceedings for Monday with the observation that if any reference was filed, it would also be taken along with the SCBA plea.

JEN Psaki

 
WASHINGTON: The Biden administration has indicated its desire to continue a careful engagement with Pakistan without committing to either improving or degrading ties with a country that was once a close ally.
The indication came at a Friday afternoon news briefing at the White House when Press Secretary Jen Psaki ignored two provocative questions that she could have used to either criticise Pakistan’s current policies or to underline the US desire to repair ties with Islamabad.
A Pakistani journalist reminded her that many, many months ago Prime Minister Imran Khan had “requested a telephone conversation” with US President Joe Biden. “We haven’t heard anything about that. Is there a specific reason for not communicating with the Pakistani leadership?” the journalist asked.
“I don’t have any update on a planned call or engagement. Obviously, we engage with Pakistan and a range of leaders at a number of levels through the State Department, through our national security team,” the White House press secretary replied. “But in terms of a call or engagement with the president, I don’t have anything to predict on that front.”

When asked about Biden-Imran phone call, White House says it has no knowledge of that

The journalist then reminded Ms Psaki that Prime Minister Khan said at recent a public gathering that “he will not be a slave of America like other (Pakistani) politicians”.
“Would you like to comment on that?” he asked.
“We have a long relationship with Pakistan, and that is a relationship we’ll continue through diplomatic channels. So, I don’t have any more comments on that,” Ms Psaki responded.
Last month, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing that the United States still considered Pakistan a strategic partner and Islamabad does not need to strain its relations with Beijing to maintain ties with Washington.
“Pakistan is a strategic partner of the United States. We have an important relationship with the government in Islamabad, and it’s a relationship that we value across a number of fronts,” he said.
Pakistan was a close US ally during the cold war and remained so till the collapse of the Soviet Union. Pakistan played a key role in the anti-Soviet war in Afghanistan and partnered with the United States in the war against terrorism as well.
The relationship started to sour when Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was found in Abbottabad and the Obama administration took him out without informing Islamabad.
In July 2019, Prime Minister Khan made an “official working” visit to Washington where he met the then president Donald Trump at the White House. He had another meeting with Mr Trump in New York during the UN General Assembly in September 2019.
Since then, there has been no face-to-face meeting between the leaders of the two countries and President Biden is yet to make a courtesy call to the Pakistani prime minister.

"ISLAMABAD: Hours after threatening to take the extreme step of disrupting the all-important meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Conference (OIC) in case National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser did not put the no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan on the day’s agenda by Monday (tomorrow), the joint opposition toned down its stance by stressing that Pakistan’s political turmoil will not be allowed to affect the event in any way.
Though the opposition did not make a categorical announcement withdrawing its threat to stage a sit-in inside the National Assembly, the venue of the OIC event, it assured the foreign ministers of the Muslim countries that upon their arrival and during their stay in Islamabad, “a conducive atmosphere in accordance with the traditional spirit of hospitality, respect and zeal would be ensured”.
The assurance was given by the joint opposition through a statement released to the media on Saturday night by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb, around five hours after the opposition leaders’ press conference where they had announced staging a sit-in inside the National Assembly hall ahead of the OIC meeting, if the speaker did not include the resolution on the agenda of the sitting to be called on Monday (tomorrow).
The threat had been hurled by Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and was immediately endorsed by PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif. Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) president Maulana Fazlur Rehman and chief of his own faction of Balochistan National Party (BNP), Akhtar Mengal, were also present.

Leaders had warned of sit-in in NA if no-trust move not placed on agenda

The joint opposition, however, in its statement later said it would warmly welcome the foreign ministers, delegates and other dignitaries of the Islamic world to Pakistan on the occasion of the 48th meeting of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers, adding “the arrival of distinguished guests is a source of joy and pride for us”.
“The opposition pledges to do its utmost to create an atmosphere in which the distinguished guests will be able to carry out their activities with full attention, dedication and determination,” said the statement.
Bilawal’s clarification
Later, Zulfikar Ali Bader, the spokesperson for Bilawal, also issued a clarification of sorts, declaring the PPP chairman was not against the OIC meeting, “but against the government’s escape from the no-confidence motion”.
“If the NA speaker delays the no-confidence motion under the guise of the OIC meeting, then there will be a reaction,” he said.
Mr Bader said PM Khan wanted to postpone the no-confidence motion till April under the garb of the OIC conference “but we will not allow Imran Khan to do so”.
Sources in the opposition told Dawn that after their news conference, their leadership met again and reviewed their announcement after receiving a reaction, not only from the government, but also from some public and other circles, as there was a general view that any attempts to disrupt the OIC event would bring a bad name to the country.
Earlier, during the news conference, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had stated that if the speaker did not introduce the no-confidence resolution in the assembly immediately after offering fateha (for a deceased PTI MNA) on Monday (tomorrow) then “my plea to my own party and the opposition parties will be that we will not leave the hall”.
“We will see how you will organise the OIC meeting,” he had stated about the gathering for which even the corps commanders in their last meeting had declared that it would be provided complete security and protection.
The PPP chairman’s remarks were endorsed by Mr Sharif, who said if the speaker did not run the house after offering prayers, “we will be compelled to stage a sit-in inside the assembly hall”.
The threats from the opposition had come amid reports that the government was planning to call the assembly session on Monday afternoon (tomorrow) on the requisition of the opposition, and that the speaker would adjourn it for three to four days due to Pakistan Day and OIC meetings after offering fateha for the departed soul of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) MNA from Hangu Khayal Zaman.
Parliamentary tradition
As per parliamentary tradition, the House does not take up any agenda on the first sitting held after the death of any member. Since this will be the first sitting after Mr Zaman’s death, it is expected the speaker may announce a prolonged adjournment after offering fateha.
Moreover, there are reports the government is planning to file a reference before the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday morning seeking interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution regarding disqualification of MNAs, and that the speaker may give a ruling during the sitting that since the matter is pending before the apex court, he could not put the no-trust resolution to vote.
Under Article 95 of the Constitution, the speaker cannot put a no-confidence resolution for a vote before three days and after seven days of its presentation before the House. The speaker, however, is bound to convene the assembly session by Monday, as the opposition had submitted the requisition notice to the National Assembly Secretariat on March 8, and he could not delay calling the session beyond 14 days.
Parliamentary history showed that the Lower House of parliament had on a number of occasions ignored the tradition of adjourning a sitting without taking up any agenda item due to the death of an MNA when something important was on the day’s plan. One such occasion came up on June 22, 2012 during the PPP government, when the National Assembly session had been convened for the election of a new prime minister after disqualification of Yousuf Raza Gilani. It was the first sitting of the House after the death of PPP MNA Fauzia Wahab, who had died on June 17.
The then speaker, Dr Fehmida Mirza -- now an ally of the PTI government -- had ignored the calls of the opposition to adjourn the sitting, and allowed the members to continue the election process after PPP’s Syed Naveed Qamar argued that since it was not a regular session, therefore, the tradition should be ignored and voting allowed.
Interestingly, the plea to adjourn the sitting had been made by Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
During the presser on Saturday, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had said they also wanted the OIC meeting to take place. But, he said, “the only way for it to happen without any problems is that the speaker plays his due role”.
“He (the speaker) should think about the country, democracy and the OIC,” Bilawal stressed.
“If he begins the no-confidence proceedings on Monday, there would be no issues in the way of the OIC and we, too, will not have any objections,” he added.
Shehbaz Sharif said those coming to attend the OIC meeting were the guests of the nation. “But we will not allow you to go against the law and Constitution under the garb of this [OIC conference]. We will stage a sit-in then,” he had declared.

"LAHORE: The Punjab prosecution department on Saturday filed a state appeal before the Supreme Court’s Lahore registry, challenging the acquittal of the sole convict in the murder case of social media sensation Qandeel Baloch.
The Lahore High Court’s Multan bench had on Feb 14 acquitted Mohammad Waseem, the brother of Qandeel, of the charges, setting aside his life imprisonment handed down by a trial court in 2019 under Section 311 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The state appeal filed by Additional Prosecutor General Khurram Khan argues that the LHC did not appreciate the law and the facts of the case in its true perspective while allowing the appeal of the convict.
It says the acquittal of the convict in the case is a miscarriage of justice.
The appeal argues that the confessional statement of the convict under Section 164 CrPC was quite convincing, but the LHC discarded it on the basis of mere technicalities and assumptions.
It states that the observations made by the court in the impugned judgement with respect to the confession are against the law of the land and not sustainable in the eye of law.
The appeal contends that in this era of scientific evidence, the bench ignored the matching DNA reports of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) which establish the case of the prosecution from all corners.
It says the death of Qandeel occurred in the house of her parents and according to Section 122 of the Qanoon-i-Shahadat Order, 1984, the burden is shifted on the accused to establish his non-involvement in the crime.
It argues that the reports of the items of DNA collected from near the body of the deceased confirmed the presence of the convict on the crime scene and his involvement in the murder of his sister.
