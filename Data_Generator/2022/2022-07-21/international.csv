0,Turkiye denies shelling Zakho after Iraqi PM’s condemnation,"PM Kadhemi warns Iraq reserves the “right to retaliate,” calling the artillery fire a “flagrant violation” of sovereignty.","ZAKHO: Nine civilians, including at least two children, were killed in a park in Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region on Wednesday by artillery fire Baghdad blamed on neighbouring Turkiye, a country engaged in a cross-border offensive.
In an unusually strong rebuke, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi warned Turkiye that Iraq reserves the  “right to retaliate,” calling the artillery fire a  “flagrant violation” of sovereignty.
But Turkey refuted Iraqi claims that it had carried out the  strike, saying the attack was a terror act.
The foreign ministry said Ankara was saddened to hear of the casualties in the attack, and added that Turkiye took maximum care to avoid civilian casualties or damaging historic, cultural sites in its counter-terrorism operations against the Kurdistan Workers Party and others.
“Turkiye is ready to take every step for the truth to come out,” the ministry said in its statement, adding that Turkish military operations were in line with international laws.
“We call on the Iraqi government to not make remarks influenced by the heinous terrorist organisation’s rhetoric and propaganda, and to engage in cooperation to uncover the perpetrators of this cruel act,” it said, referring to the PKK.
Turkey launched an offensive in northern Iraq in April dubbed  “Operation Claw-Lock”, which it said targets fighters from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
The victims included Iraqi tourists who had come to the hill village of Parakh in Zakho district to escape sweltering temperatures further south in the country, according to Mushir Bashir, the head of Zakho region. “Turkey hit the village twice today,” Bashir said.
A source in Turkey’s defence ministry said that he had  “no information reporting or confirming artillery fire in this area”.
The artillery strikes killed nine and wounded 23, Zakho health official Amir Ali told reporters. He had earlier put the toll at eight dead, including two children.
‘Bodies in the water’
In front of a hospital in Zakho, Hassan Tahsin Ali spoke to this news agency wearing a bandage around his head. He said he was lucky to survive the deluge of fire that fell on the park and its water features, where visitors had been relaxing. “We come from the province of Babylon,” the young man said in a slow voice.
“There were indiscriminate strikes on us, there were bodies in the water,” he added.  “Our young people are dead, our children are dead, who should we turn to? We have only God.” Iraq’s prime minister dispatched the country’s foreign minister and top security officials to the site.
“Turkish forces have perpetrated once more a flagrant violation of Iraqi sovereignty,” Kadhemi said on Twitter, condemning the harm caused to  “the life and security of Iraqi citizens.”  “Iraq reserves the right to retaliate against these aggressions and take all necessary measures to protect our people,” Kadhemi added.

1,Draghi on last legs as bid to save Italy govt fails,ROME: Italy’s popular Prime Minister Mario Draghi looked out of time on Wednesday after three political parties...,"ROME: Italy’s popular Prime Minister Mario Draghi looked out of time on Wednesday after three political parties refused to take part in a confidence vote, foiling efforts to resolve a crisis now expected to lead to his resignation and snap elections.
Draghi had made the support of parties across the political spectrum key to ending an impasse that risked destabilising the eurozone’s third largest economy just as it struggled with pressing domestic and geopolitical woes.
The decision by three parties — Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia, the anti-immigrant League and populist Five Star Movement — to sit out the vote meant Draghi’s bid to revive his beleaguered coalition had failed.
Draghi technically won the vote, but was not expected to declare a victory after the parties’ snub.
The stand by  “irresponsible” parties risked  “creating a perfect storm,” EU Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said on Twitter, adding that Italy faced  “difficult months ahead”.
“The centre-right will go down in history as the ones who got rid of Mario Draghi,” Francesco Galietti, Policy Sonar analyst, said.
Draghi had warned the Senate that now was not the time for uncertainty, amid a myriad of challenges, from a struggling economy to the Ukraine war.
He called for  “courage, selflessness, credibility” from parliamentarians, asking them:  “Are you ready?” 
‘Day of madness’
In a stern speech given on Wednesday morning by a usually softly-spoken Draghi, the former leader of the European Central Bank, who offered his resignation last week, had said he was prepared to stay — but on one condition: if the wildly disparate parties pledged anew to a common agenda.
But the League and Forza Italia said it was impossible to recover trust lost after a crisis sparked by Five Star’s decision to opt out of a confidence vote last week.
Draghi had been persuaded by Italy’s president not to resign immediately, but to reach out to parties first. That attempt Wednesday failed.
“On this day of madness, parliament decided to turn against Italy,” Enrico Letta, head of the centre-left Democratic Party, said on Twitter.
“Italians will show in the ballot box that they are wiser than their representatives,” he said, as speculation mounted that Draghi would once again hand in his resignation.
Polls in the lead up to Wednesday’s drama suggested most Italians wanted Draghi, 74, to stay at the helm until the scheduled general election in May next year.
His departure could force the president to dissolve parliament and call elections for September or October.
“Draghi did not compromise. He was very tough,” Galietti said.  “The entire speech was stick and carrot -- though much more stick than carrot”.
There is much at stake: a government collapse could worsen social ills in a period of rampant inflation, delay the budget, threaten EU post-pandemic recovery funds and send jittery markets into a tailspin.

2,Nasa to launch moon rocket on Aug 29,Artemis-1 is the first in a series of missions as the United States seeks to return humans to the Moon.,"WASHINGTON: Mark your calendars: Nasa’s Artemis programme to return to the Moon could launch its first uncrewed test flight as soon as August 29, the agency said on Wednesday.
Artemis-1 is the first in a series of missions as the United States seeks to return humans to the Moon, build a sustained presence there, and use the lessons gained to plan a trip to Mars sometime in the 2030s.
Nasa associate administrator Jim Free told reporters the first window of possible launch dates for the giant Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion crew capsule were August 29, September 2, and September 5.
The decision follows final checks on the ground at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida known as  “wet dress rehearsals.” The last of these tests, carried out in June, met 90 percent of the team’s goals, and on Wednesday Cliff Lanham, senior vehicle operations manager, said engineers have now replaced faulty seals that had caused a hydrogen leak on SLS during the final trial.
Artemis-1 is set to journey around the far side of the Moon in a mission lasting four to six weeks — longer than any ship for astronauts has done without docking, before returning home faster and hotter than every vessel before.
It will also deploy a number of small satellites called CubeSats to perform experiments in space.
Artemis mission manager Mike Sarafin told reporters:  “Our first and our primary objective is to demonstrate Orion’s heat shield in lunar reentry conditions.” When the capsule returns from the Moon, it will be traveling about 24,500 miles an hour (39,400 kilometers per hour) and experience temperatures half as hot as the Sun outside its heat shield.
The second objective is to demonstrate the flight worthiness of the rocket and crew capsule as they perform all their maneuvers over the course of the mission.
Finally, Nasa will look to successfully retrieve Orion after splashdown, and thoroughly inspect it.
Artemis-2 will be the first crewed test, flying around the Moon but not landing, while Artemis-3 will see the first woman and first person of color touch down on the lunar south pole.

3,Iran clarifies nuclear policy unchanged after ‘bomb’ remark,"Foreign ministry says Iran has ""fatwa"" that prohibits manufacture of such weapons.","TEHRAN: Tehran gave assurances on Wednesday that its nuclear policy was unchanged and that it still adhered to a fatwa banning weapons of mass destruction, after an Iranian official said the country was able to make atomic bombs.
It is the second time in the past 18 months that Iran has reiterated its opposition to nuclear weapons following comments by an official.
“In regard to the topic of weapons of mass destruction, we have the fatwa”, or religious edict, by Iran’s supreme leader that prohibits the manufacture of such weapons, said foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani.
The fatwa declares the use of atomic bombs and other weapons of mass destruction to be  “haram”, or forbidden by Islam, and it is often cited by Iranian authorities as a guarantee of Tehran’s good intentions.
“It seems that there has been no change in the view and position of the Islamic Republic of Iran” regarding the nuclear policy, Kanani told a news conference.
His comments came in response to a question about remarks made by Kamal Kharazi, head of Iran’s strategic council of foreign relations to Al Jazeera on Sunday about Iran’s capability to manufacture nuclear weapons.
“It is no secret to anyone that we have the technical capability to make atomic bombs, but we have not made a decision in this regard,” Kharazi said, before reiterating Iran’s position that it does not want to make a nuclear bomb.
Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Kanani said:  “Iran’s nuclear capacities are great, but, as it has mentioned many times, Iran’s nuclear technology is completely peaceful and under continued monitoring of the (UN’s) International Atomic Energy Agency.” The remarks came amid heightened tensions between Iran and Western powers as talks in Vienna to revive a 2015 nuclear deal have been stalled since March.
Vienna talks
Qatar hosted indirect talks last month between the United States and Iran in a bid to get the process back on track, but those discussions broke up after two days without any breakthrough.
The Vienna talks, which began in April last year, aim to return the US to the nuclear deal, including through the lifting of sanctions on Iran, and to return Tehran to full compliance with its commitments.
The 2015 agreement gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its atomic programme to guarantee that Tehran could not develop a nuclear weapon — something it has always denied wanting to do.
But the US unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump and the reimpositon of biting economic sanctions prompted Iran to begin rolling back on its own commitments.
On Tuesday, State Department spokesman Ned Price said US President Joe Biden  “has made a commitment that Iran will not acquire a nuclear weapon”.
“We continue to believe that diplomacy is the most effective, durable, and sustainable means by which to achieve that,” he added.
In February 2021, Iran reiterated its opposition to nuclear weapons after then intelligence minister, Mahmoud Alavi, said it would not be the Islamic republic’s fault if it was ever  “pushed” towards developing a nuclear bomb.
Iran had claimed the existence of the fatwa for years before making the text public for the first time in 2010, at a time of crisis over its nuclear programme.
Tehran was at the time accused by the international community, especially the West and Israel, of seeking to secretly acquire the atomic bomb.

4,Putin kept waiting for Erdogan before talks,Turkiye’s T24 website asked in a headline: “Was it revenge?”,"ISTANBUL: Russian President Vladimir Putin was left waiting and fidgeting for 50 seconds by Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan before talks in Tehran on Tuesday, prompting Turkish media to draw parallels with Putin making him and other leaders stand by in the past. 
The meeting in Iran was Putin’s first with a Nato alliance leader since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. 
A video released by the Turkish presidency showed Putin standing in front of his chair and the nations’ two flags, his hands clasped, mouth twitching and his stance shifting before Erdogan appears. Putin then raises his hands to his sides. 
“Hello, how are you, good?” Erdogan said as they then smiled at each other and shook hands. 
Media reports compared the incident with others of Putin letting world leaders cool their heels in the past, notably in Moscow in 2020 when Erdogan was left waiting for about two minutes by the Russian leader ahead of a meeting.

5,UN records hundreds of killings and rights violations by Taliban,"Says violations targeted at groups, including those associated with the ousted government, human rights defenders and journalists.","KABUL: The United Nations mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said on Wednesday that the ruling Taliban were responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests, and inhumane punishments in the 10 months since they seized power.
An UNAMA report said the violations were targeted at a number of groups, including those associated with the ousted government, human rights defenders and journalists. Women’s rights had also been eroded, it said.
“UNAMA is concerned about the impunity with which members of the de facto authorities appear to have carried out human rights violations,” it said in a statement.
The term “de facto authorities” refers to the Taliban administration which took over Afghanistan in August last year after foreign forces withdrew and the elected government collapsed.
A spokesman for the Taliban government rejected the report’s findings, calling them baseless.
“Arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killing are not allowed,” Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter. Anyone found guilty of such violations will be considered a criminal and will be dealt with according to Sharia law, he said.
Taliban officials have in the past said retribution attacks were not happening with their leadership’s consent and that they had barred fighters from such actions. They also said they had began a process of purging their ranks of elements that did not fully follow instructions.
While the statement acknowledged steps taken by Taliban authorities apparently aimed at protecting human rights, as well as a  “significant reduction in armed violence”, it said authorities also bear responsibility.
UNAMA particularly mentioned the role of two bodies in violations — the Ministry of Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice as well as the General Directorate of Intelligence.
The report said the hardest hit victims were those associated with the former government and its security forces.
It listed 160 extrajudicial killings, 178 arbitrary arrests, and 56 instances of torture and ill-treatment of former government employees.
Human rights violations also affected 173 journalists and media workers, 163 of which were attributed to Taliban authorities, including 122 arbitrary arrests and 33 instances of threats. UNAMA also stressed the erosion of womens rights.
“Women and girls have progressively had their rights to fully participate in education, the workplace and other aspects of public and daily life restricted and in many cases completely taken away.”  UNAMA recorded 2,106 civilian casualties — 700 killed, 1,406 wounded — since the Taliban takeover. 
A majority were attributed to a local affiliate of the militant Islamic State group.

6,Russia says its military aims now go beyond Ukraine’s east,"Russian, Ukrainian delegations are expected in Istanbul in coming days for talks on unblocking Ukraine’s grain exports.","KYIV: Russia said on Wednesday that its military aims in Ukraine have expanded beyond the industrial Donbas region as its forces launched deadly barrages over the east and the south of the country.
The warning came as the European Commission called on EU countries to slash demand for natural gas to relieve dependence on Russian energy and the bloc agreed an embargo on Russian gold imports.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in an interview that Moscow’s military was no longer  “only” focused on wresting control of the east Ukraine regions of Lugansk and Donetsk, which have been partially controlled by pro-Moscow rebels for years.
“The geography is different now. It is not only about the DNR and LNR, but also the Kherson region, the Zaporizhzhia region and a number of other territories” he explained to state media.
Russian forces, since invading on Feb 24, have steadily advanced into each of those regions, wreaking destruction as they captured key cities and met fierce Ukrainian resistance.
Ukrainian Foreign Mini­ster Dmytro Kuleba, respo­nded to Lavrov’s remarks by calling on allies of his country to ramp up sanctions on Moscow and speed arms deliveries to Kyiv.
“By confessing dreams to grab more Ukrainian land, Russian Foreign Minister (Sergei Lavrov) proves that Russia rejects diplomacy and focuses on war and terror,” he said.
Emergency energy plans 
Announcing an emergency plan on Wednesday, the European Commission  asked EU countries to reduce demand for natural gas by 15 percent to  secure sufficient storage ahead of winter.
EU commissioners have  also asked member states to give Brussels special powers to impose  compulsory energy rationing if Russia cuts off Europe’s gas lifeline.Lavrov also dismissed the idea of further peace talks with Ukraine, claiming that earlier rounds showed Kyiv was unwilling to negotiate in  “earnest”. “It doesn’t make any sense in the current situation,” he told state media.
Russian and Ukrainian delegations are nevertheless expected in Istanbul in the coming days for more talks on unblocking Ukraine’s Black Sea grain exports.
Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday he hoped an agreement could be formulated  “this week”.
Mykolaiv, the largest city under Ukrainian control near Russian-occupied Kherson and the southern front, has been shelled persistently since the beginning of the invasion.
The regional governor on Wednesday announced the city would be closed  “for a day or two” in several weeks to process information on people believed to have been collaborating with Russian troops.
The announcement comes after Zelensky in Kyiv fired several senior law enforcement officials — including the head of the security services — accusing their departments of having failed to crack down on spies and Kremlin sympathisers.
The West has responded to Russia’s invasion with several packages of damaging sanctions, which in turn has seen Russia cut natural gas supplies to the bloc, spurring a supply and cost crisis.
In its latest package of penalties, the EU targeted gold exports and froze assets at Russia’s largest bank Sberbank.

7,Climate activists block UK’s busiest motorway after deadly heatwave,US heatwave tightens its grip from coast to coast,"LONDON: Climate demonstrators on Wednesday triggered a lengthy tailback on Britain’s busiest motorway, warning that a record-breaking heatwave was a dire reminder for urgent action.
Members of the group Just Stop Oil climbed gantries over the M25 encircling London, causing police to intervene and vehicles to back up for several miles (kilometres) in one direction. Surrey Police later said a 22-year-old woman who had climbed a gantry was arrested on suspicion of causing a danger to road users, causing a public nuisance and for being a pedestrian on the motorway. Three lanes that were shut as she was brought down were later reopened, the force added.
Temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in southern and eastern England for the first time on Tuesday, with a new record set at 40.3C.
The extreme heat caused huge transport disruption and sparked the same kind of wildfires seen in Europe in recent years. Government minister Kit Malthouse told parliament that 34 places saw temperatures in excess of the previous record of 38.7C in 2019.

9,Kaleemullah Khan: India’s father of 300 mango varieties,"Khan has named some of his varieties after Aishwarya Rai, Sachin Tendulkar and PM Modi.","MALIHABAD: Every day, Indian octogenarian Kaleemullah Khan wakes at dawn, prays, then ambles about a mile to his 120-year-old mango tree, which he has coaxed into producing more than 300 varieties of the beloved fruit over the years.
His footsteps quicken as he draws nearer and his eyes light up as he peers closely at the branches through his spectacles, caressing the leaves and sniffing the fruits to see if they are ripe. “This is my prize of toiling hard in the scorching sun for decades,” the 82-year-old said in his orchard in the small town of Malihabad.
“For the naked eye, it’s just a tree. But if you see through your mind, it’s a tree, an orchard, and the biggest mango college in the world.” The school dropout was just a teenager when he conducted his first experiment in grafting, or joining plant parts to create new mango varieties.
He nurtured a tree to produce seven new kinds of fruit, but it blew down in a storm.

Khan has named some of his varieties after Aishwarya Rai, Sachin Tendulkar and PM Modi

But since 1987, his pride and joy has been the 120-year-old specimen, source of more than 300 different types of mango, each with their own taste, texture, colour and size, he says. One of the earliest varieties he named  “Aishwarya” after Bollywood star and 1994 Miss World beauty pageant winner Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. To this day, it remains one of his  “best creations”.
“The mango is as beautiful as the actress. One mango weighs more than a kilogram (two pounds), has a tinge of crimson to its outer skin and it tastes very sweet,” Khan said.
Others he named in honour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and cricket hero Sachin Tendulkar. Another is  “Anarkali”, or pomegranate blossom, and has two layers of different skin and two different pulps, each with a distinctive aroma.
“People will come and go, but the mangoes will remain forever, and years after, whenever this Sachin mango will be eaten, people will remember the cricketing hero,” said the father of eight.
Famed fruit
Standing nine metres (30 feet) tall, his treasured tree has a stout trunk with wide-spreading, thick branches that yield a pleasant shade against the Indian summer sun.
The leaves are a patchwork of different textures and smells. In some places, they are yellow and glossy, and in others, a dark, dull green. “No two fingerprints are the same, and no two mango varieties are similar. Nature has gifted mangoes with traits like humans,” Khan said.

10,Mammals became warm-blooded later than thought: study,PARIS: The ancestors of mammals started to become warm-blooded around 20 million years later than previously ...,"PARIS: The ancestors of mammals started to become warm-blooded around 20 million years later than previously thought, researchers suggested on Wednesday, after analysing inner-ear fossils hoping to solve  “one of the great unsolved mysteries of palaeontology”.
Warm-bloodedness is one of the quintessential characteristics of mammals, along with fur, but exactly when they first evolved the feature has long been a subject of debate.
Previous research has indicated that the ancestors of mammals began evolving warm-bloodedness, or endothermy, around 252 million years ago — around the time of the Permian extinction, known as the  “Great Dying”. However figuring out the timeline has proved difficult.
“The problem is that you cannot stick thermometers in your fossils, so you cannot measure their body temperature,” said Ricardo Araujo of the University of Lisbon, one of the authors of a new study in the journal Nature. He was part of an international team of researchers that found a new way to determine how body heat changed throughout time, by examining the semicircular canals in the inner ears of 56 extinct species of mammal ancestors. Fluid runs through the tiny ear canals, which help animals keep their balance.
The researchers realised that as body temperatures warmed up, so did the ear fluid. Araujo gave the example of oil used to fry hot chips. Before you warm the oil up, it is  “very viscous, very dense,” he said.
“But then when you heat it up, you’ll see that the oil is much runnier, it flows much more easily.” The runnier ear fluid led to animals evolving narrower canals — which can be measured in fossils, allowing the researchers to track body temperature over time.
Unlike previous research on this subject, the team developed a model that not only works on extinct mammal ancestors, but also living mammals, including humans.
