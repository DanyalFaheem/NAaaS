0,Yasmin Rashid demands ECP notify Punjab by-poll winners,"In application to commission, demands action against alleged horse-trading by PM Shehbaz, Rana Sanaullah.","LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Central Punjab President Dr Yasmin Rashid on Wednesday urged the Election Commission of Pakistan to notify the party’s winning candidates of the results of the by-election for 20 seats – vacated after the disqualification of turncoats. 
In her application to the commission, Dr Rashid also demanded that it should take action on horse trading by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah. 
Dr Rashid through her counsel Rana Mudassar Umer stated that four days had already passed since the by-election, but the commission had yet to issue the notifications of elected members from the respective constituencies without any excuse or legal justification. She stated that any delay would not only be illegal but also contemptuous to the Supreme Court’s July 1 order in the case titled as “Mohammad Sibtain Khan and other versus the Province of Punjab through its chief secretary and others”. 
Dr Rashid stated that the winning candidates had yet to take the oath and then participate in the next session of the Punjab Assembly scheduled and notified for July 22 (Friday) in the Punjab Assembly building. 
She stated that the delay in announcement/declaration of the result of the by-election without any justification would strengthen the element of corrupt and illegal practises by the prime minister and the interior minister, who are not only misusing their authority to influence the independent institution, but both of them also illegally unlawfully using the government machinery for horse trading that needed to be dealt with iron hands and required immediate and strict action. 
The PTI central Punjab president demanded that the election commission notify the elected candidates so that they could take an oath and participate in the next scheduled session. 
She demanded that strict action should be taken on the factors of undue influence, unlawful use of government machinery and misuse of authority by the prime minister and the interior minister.

2,Replies sought on plea against harassment to PTI members,Petition says there are apprehensions that Rana Sanaullah will use state machinery to sabotage Punjab CM election.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Wednesday sought replies from the federal and provincial governments on the petition of a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) MPA against alleged harassment to the members of the party and to ensure a fair and transparent election of the chief minister of Punjab taking place on July 22. 
At the outset of the hearing, Justice Aalia Neelum asked Advocate Azhar Siddique, the petitioner’s counsel, as to who harassed his client MPA Zainab Umair. 
The lawyer alleged that the petitioner faced harassment at the hands of Federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan.
“Where is she now?” the judge asked the counsel about his client.
The counsel said the petitioner was in the Punjab Assembly to attend a session. 
The judge asked the counsel whether the petitioner faced any harassment at the assembly or someone restrained her from attending the session.
Advocate Siddique said MPAs of the PTI received threatening messages from police on their Whatsapp.
Justice Neelum directed the counsel to affix the record of the alleged threatening messages with the petition. The judge also advised the counsel to avoid drafting unnecessarily lengthy petitions. 
A provincial law officer questioned the maintainability of the petition and asked the court to dismiss the same.
The judge, however, turned down the request and sought replies form the respondents by Thursday (today).
Petitioner Ms Umair contended in her petition that there were apprehensions that Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan would use the state machinery to sabotage the election of the chief minister. 
She said after the victory of PTI in the by-election, the government could harass the members of her party. She said there was a possibility that the government would resort to coercive measures to keep the PTI MPAs away from the polling for the chief minister. 
Ms Umair asked the court to order the authorities to ensure a fair and transparent election on July 22 and free participation of all candidates and members of the assembly in it. 
‘HORSE TRADING’: PTI MPA Zainab Umair also approached the Supreme Court with a request to take action against the alleged ‘horse trading’ in the upcoming election of the chief minister of Punjab. 
The MPA filed a petition at the Lahore registry of the SC pleading that the government did not make legislation to curb ‘horse trading’ despite a direction by the court. She alleged that the coalition government was alluring PTI MPAs against huge money. 
She asked the court to take notice of the situation and order the government to make legislation so that the menace of ‘horse trading’ could be rooted out from the politics of the country.

As per police sources, Daulat Nagar Station House officer (SHO) Sub-Inspector Aslam Hunjra had arrested three suspects, including a woman, in connection with two different cases -- one of illicit weapons and the other of drug peddling -- on Monday the last. 
As per the standard operating procedure (SOPs), a police raiding team involved in the arrest of suspects in a criminal case gets photographed with them, and if there is any woman among those arrested, the presence of a lady constable is a must in such pictures.   
However, the Daulata Nagar SHO became ‘innovative’ when he was told that no lady constable was available for the picture with the suspects, who included a woman, and reportedly directed a male official to “play the role” by wearing hijab to complete the formality. 
Unfortunately, the policeman assigned the female role happened to be tall enough to get noticed in the picture issued to the local media and later went viral on social media, drawing taunts from netizens.  
Following the social media uproar, the matter was taken up by senior police officers, including Gujrat district police officer (DPO), who suspended the SHO concerned from service and ordered an inquiry into the matter. 
Gujrat Sadar circle deputy superintendent of police (DSP) has been assigned the inquiry with instructions to complete it within 24 hours and submit a report. 
Giving background of the episode, a senior official of Gujrat police said that in fact most of the woman police staffers had been sent to Sargodha range for security duty during the by-polls held in Bhakkar and Khushab on Saturday the last, causing a shortage of female officials. 
He said the old-school SHO might have taken the issue lightly, casting one of his male subordinates in the lady constable’s role, ignoring his height and ultimately causing embarrassment to the department.

6,Rape complainant ‘in utter shock’,"“I’m not sure if I can ever recover from mental scars. I hope that there will be justice for me in the case,” she says.","DERA GHAZI KHAN: The foreigner complainant of rape by her tour host is in trauma. She says she is in utter shock after the horrible act.
Talking to Dawn, the female vlogger, allegedly raped by her tour guide, said on Wednesday she felt deeply disturbed by the fact that a friend she knew and trusted him for a long time betrayed her. 
“He raped me who is portraying the positive image of this beautiful country to foreign travellers,” she sobbed. 
“I’m not sure if I can ever recover from mental scars. I hope that there will be justice for me in the case.” 
The woman was allegedly raped by her “guide” at the tribal area tourist resort,  Fort Munro, in Dera Ghazi Khan district on July 16 where she was on a trip. Acting on her complaint, the Border Military Police arrested the prime suspect, ‘M’ (21), also said to be an American citizen.
The suspect, who is a software engineer and works as an online tourist guide, and the complainant woman were brought to the teaching hospital of the Ghazi Medical College for medical examination. Hospital sources confirmed that the woman was raped. 
The suspect told Dawn that he and the vlogger exchanged love threads in Uch Sharif and established a love bond. Later, she also shared her private time with another local social media activist (who had already been acquaintances with her) on July 16.

7,Jail head given high-profile post a day after inmate’s ‘murder’ in Faisalabad,Home dept move raises eyebrows; committee set up to probe the alleged murder.,"LAHORE: The transfer and appointment of Faisalabad Central Jail head against a high-profile post, a day after the alleged murder of an inmate in his jurisdiction, that too without waiting for the findings of a probe ordered into the matter by prisons inspector general, puts a big question mark on the accountability mechanism of the Punjab home department.  
Instead of holding accountable the Faisalabad jail superintendent for the incident taking place in his jurisdiction, the home department transferred and posted him as superintendent of high-profile Central Jail, Rawalpindi (also known as Adyala jail). 
An official told Dawn that appointment as superintendent of Adyala jail is considered a “prized posting” in the prisons department. 
Usually under-trial prisoners from Islamabad and Rawalpindi division are housed in Adyala jail that is also know for holding high-profile political figures, including former premiers Nawaz Sahirf and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was later hanged following a sham trial. Presently, Adyala jail was housing 4,337 prisoners against its authorised capacity of 1,994, the official record shows. 

Home dept move raises eyebrows  

Faisalabad Central Jail Superintendent Chaudhry Asghar was posted against the top slot of Adyala jail, Rawalpindi, a day after a young prisoner, Imran Musthaq (28), was allegedly tortured to death in the [Faisalabad] jail he was heading. 
When father of the deceased inmate, Imran, reached the hospital following a phone call by an official, informing him that his son was admitted there for “treatment of some ailment”,  he found his son lying dead there with several torture marks on various parts of his body. 
The allegations of torture later proved true and the police lodged a murder case against 10 officials of the Central Jail, Faisalabad, on the complaint of Imran’s father. 
Usually, following such serious crimes committed inside a prison, the superintendent of the jail concerned, is also questioned for any negligence, being the supervisory officer, and, in many cases, made an official on special duty (OSD) as a punishment, to ensure a fair departmental inquiry, the official says, adding that Mr Chaudhry’s case seems to be an exception.  
Punjab home department issued a notification on Wednesday, appointing BS-18 officer Chaudhry Asghar as new superintendent of Adyala jail, Rawalpindi. Mr Ashgar replaced Sajid Baig as superintendent of Central Jail Rawalpindi, who was appointed there just a day back (on Tuesday). 
The appointment of Mr Chaudhry against the high-profile post a day after posting of Mr Baig there raised many eyebrows in the prisons department. 
Following the alleged murder of Imran in Faisalabad Central Jail, the Punjab inspector general of prisons had constituted a committee to probe into the incident and to determine the role of superintendent and other officials.  
According to a notification issued on Tuesday in this respect, Punjab prisons DIG Kamran Anjum was made convener of the five-member inquiry committee. The other members included Faisalabad District Jail Superintendent Ali Akbar, Okara District Jail Superintendent Mian Umair and two medical officers (of Faisalabad District Jail) -- Dr Mohammad Arshad and Dr Mohammad Usman.  
“The committee comprising five officers is hereby constituted to  conduct a detailed fact-finding inquiry into the death of under-trial  prisoner Imran in Central Jail Faisalabad”, reads the notification (a  copy is available with Dawn). 
It says the committee will  immediately proceed to the Central Jail Faisalabad to record the  statements of all the concerned officers, officials and prisoners and  submit a detailed report,  
while also fixing responsibility  on delinquent officers/officials, prisoners (if any) regarding alleged  torture of the deceased prisoner within next 24 hours. 
The official wondered why home department didn’t even bother to wait for the findings of the inquiry committee in the prisoner’s murder case and posted Chaudhry Asghar against a high-profile slot in such a haste. This puts a big question mark on the home department’s accountability mechanism, he adds.

8,Punjab PA adopts resolution apprehending mischief in CM election,"It's alleged in resolution that Rana Sanaullah, Punjab home minister are pressurising opposition MPAs through IB, police.","LAHORE: The ongoing controversial Punjab Assembly session on Wednesday adopted a resolution expressing concerns at alleged efforts to sabotage the election for the office of the Punjab chief minister. 
The resolution was tabled by opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Mian Aslam Iqbal and was unanimously adopted by the house as the ruling coalition has been boycotting proceedings of the session, calling it illegal. 
It was alleged in the resolution that the federal interior minister and Punjab home minister were pressurising [the opposition MPAs] through the Intelligence Bureau and police, while [former president] Asif Ali Zardari is in Lahore to buy loyalties of the people through his wealth. 
All these steps were in violation of the Supreme Court orders, it said, adding that the names of those sabotaging our mandate would be written in black words in history. 
Sibtain Khan, another PTI leader, said the ‘illegal’ and ‘imported’ government had created a constitutional crisis during the last three months. He said the incumbent government took every step that was unheard of in the last 70 years as it did nothing except abolishing the national accountability law during the three months. 
MPA Sajida Begum said the constitutional crisis in the provincial house was unprecedented. She said whatever the PML-N did in the house [during the April 16 vote for the CM’s office] would be observed as a black day. 
MPAs Ayesha Iqbal and Firdaus Rana also spoke as the proceedings were put off for Thursday (today).  
Meanwhile, Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi says the PTI and PML-Q have the  majority and every attempt to kidnap or harass MPAs will be thwarted and  after the statement of interior minister Rana Sanaullah, the matter has  already been taken to the Supreme Court.  
Mr Elahi was speaking  to PTI vice-chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi, who called on him at the Punjab Assembly chambers on Wednesday.  
Former Governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, MNA Hussain Elahi, MPAs Mian  Mahmood-ur-Rasheed, Mian Aslam Iqbal, Sajid Ahmed Khan Bhatti, Murad  Ras, Waseem Badozai, Hafiz Amar Yasir, Mohsin Leghari and newly elected  MPAs Zain Qureshi, Amir Iqbal Shah.

The PML-Q president said the solution to country’s problems lied in getting out of the giddiness of counting and paying attention to the problems of the poor man. He said only those would be counted in real sense who would be successful in solving problems of the poor. He said those elected should serve people and stop worrying to let down each other.  
Mr Hussain said the “elected government should get a chance to rule for one and a half years, if not, then go for immediate elections, immediate elections means immediate, not in months.”

Earlier, the same magistrate sent Zahra to Darul Aman as she cited threats to her life at the hands of her parents.
Syed Mehdi Ali Kazmi, the father, contended through his counsel Fahad Ahmad Siddiqui that an application filed by the girl wanting to go to Darul Aman was a result of another malicious scheme hatched by Zaheer Ahmad, the alleged husband of the girl.
He said Ahmad hatched the scheme after the courts ordered the police of Sindh and Punjab courts to arrest him and recover the minor girl from his illegal custody.
The applicant asked the magistrate to grant interim custody of her daughter to the child protection bureau instead of keeping her at the Darul Aman.
Magistrate Rizwan Ahmad would take up the application on Thursday.
The girl appeared before the magistrate along with her counsel seeking direction to send her to the government shelter.
Zahra said her relationship with her husband became strained and her life was also in danger at the hands of her parents and other relatives.
The applicant said she left the house of her husband and spent the previous night at the house of a relative. The girl said she had no place to live and wanted the court to send her to Darul Aman for her better security.
Magistrate Rizwan Ahmad allowed the application and directed a state prosecutor to ensure the shifting of the girl to Darul Aman of the city district government till further orders.

13,"Four-hour rain spell submerges Shakargarh roads, streets",Rainwater enters city police station,"NAROWAL: The four-hour heavy rain spell on Wednesday submerged most of the roads and streets of Shakargarh city, besides low-lying areas and buildings, including that of city police station.  
Citizens blamed the administration for not taking timely measures to avoid accumulation of rainwater by improving sewerage and drainage system.  
Following the four-hour heavy rain spell, around two-feet rainwater accumulated on the roads in Shakargarh city, while it was up to four feet in some low-lying streets.  
Around two to three feet rainwater got accumulated in the Shakargarh city police station, submerging its courtyard, investigation rooms, lock-up, record room and the police barracks.  

Rainwater enters city police station

The police officials, with the help of locals, immediately shifted the record files, computer equipment and even the suspects detained in the lock-up to a nearby under-construction building.  
Azmat Ali, a local, regretted that he had been witnessing such scenes at the city police station during every rainy season at least for the past five years, but no measures had been taken by the authorities concerned to improve the situation. 
Meanwhile, locals, including Abdul Ghafoor and Mujahid Ali. blamed incompetence of the district administration and local municipal authorities for accumulation of rainwater and poor sewerage and drainage system in Shakargarh city.  
He said as there was no proper sewerage system in Shakargarh, the sewage had been accumulating on Antuwali-Norkot Road for the last two years, causing problems for the people.  
Municipal Committee (MC) Services Officer Muhammad Afzal said that drains were being constructed to improve the sewerage system. He said that disposal pumps have also been made functional to remove rainwater from the city. He blamed the lack of cooperation by local roads department for accumulation of sewage and rainwater on Norkot Road. 
Assistant Commissioner (AC) Maria Javed, who is also administrator of Shakargarh MC, admitted the sewerage system of the city has become dilapidated, resulting in poor drainage of sewage and rainwater, especially during monsoon rains. She said de-watering pumps were working round the clock to flush out the rainwater from the city areas, while the work to improve sewerage system has also been started.  
The AC said meetings have been held with the roads department for construction of sewer culvert on Norkot Road by raising it, but the department was delaying its construction.  
District police spokesperson Aitzaz Bashir said the old building of Shakargarh City Police Station was below the road level, resulting in accumulation of rainwater every monsoon. 
He said because of timely removal of record and computer equipment from the police station, any serious damage was avoided despite accumulation of rainwater in its building. 
Mr Bashir said new building for the city police station was under construction, that would solve the problem.
