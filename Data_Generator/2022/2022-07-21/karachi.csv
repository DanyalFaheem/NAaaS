1,Plea against law for transgender persons dismissed,SHC bench observes that the matter fall within court’s jurisdiction as it will come within domain of Federal Shariat Court.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has dismissed a petition challenging the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2018.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Arshad Hussain Khan observed that the matter did not fall within the court’s jurisdiction under Article 199 as it would come within the domain of the Federal Shariat Court.
The bench in its order said that petitioner Samira Mahamadi had invoked the jurisdiction of SHC while describing herself to be a public interest litigant and self-educated in religion and pleaded to declare the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act ultra vires to the Constitution and Islamic ideology.
“A perusal of the act reflects that the same was enacted for providing protection, relief and rehabilitation of the rights of transgender persons and its substantive sections thus provide for the recognition of their identity, prohibition against discrimination and harassment as well as further protection of the right of inheritance, education, holding of public office, access to public places and ownership and holding of property,” it added.
However, the bench said that the contention of the petitioner was that in recognising the gender identity of such persons, the act was contrary to social and cultural norms and violated Article 14 of the Constitution as doing so offended the dignity of man.
“Having examined the matter we are unable to discern any valid ground, and the entire crux of the matter as argued by the petitioner even otherwise revolves around the assertion that the Act is contrary to Quranic injunctions and Islamic values, hence the legislature was not competent to pass such a law,” it added.
The bench in its order stated: “Needless to say such a ground does not fall within the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 and would, if at all, fall within the domain of Federal Shariat Court under Article 203-D of the Constitution. That being so, the petition stands dismissed in limine.”
Meanwhile, another bench of SHC issued notices to the Sindh home secretary, director general of Rangers, inspector general of police and other respondents on a petition seeking whereabouts of a missing girl.
Petitioner Tahira approached the SHC stating that on June 26, her 14-year-old daughter Misbah Hussain had gone missing from Malir and so far her whereabouts were not known.

2,Sepa chief signs ‘fresh’ EIA report of Malir Expressway to avoid legal troubles,"Malir residents, environmentalists challenged EIA approval given in April by a deputy director.","KARACHI: The director general of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) has signed the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report of the Malir Expressway in what appears to be an attempt to save him and the controversial project from legal troubles, it emerged on Wednesday.
It was transpired during the hearing of appeals against Malir Expressway before the Sindh Environmental Tribunal when a lawyer also produced a copy of the ‘fresh’ EIA report dated June 10 and signed by Sepa DG Muhammad Naeem Mughal.
The EIA approval was earlier in April granted by a Sepa deputy director and environmentalist challenged this act stating that an official grant of the approval was required to be signed by the director general. In this respect, they cited the order of the environmental tribunal in the Seaview commercialisation case in which it clearly stated that approval was an appealable order and needed to be signed by the director general himself.
When the hearing began before the tribunal headed by retired Justice Nisar Ahmed Sheikh, an official appeared on behalf of Sepa and submitted the record of proceedings related to the process of EIA approval for the proposed project in compliance with the earlier directives of the tribunal.

Malir residents, environmentalists challenged EIA approval given in April by a deputy director

Advocate Ravi Pinjani, who represented M/s Malir Expressway Limited, also produced a copy of the ‘fresh’ EIA report dated June 10 and signed by Sepa director general removing the appellants’ objection that the earlier EIA report was signed by a deputy director who got no legal authority to issue such an approval under the law.
Regarding the merits of the appeals, the counsel argued that the appellants never raised any environmental concerns with regard to the environment of the metropolis.
He argued that since the tribunal’s domain was environmental concerns and the appeals should be dismissed for lacking merit since the appellants did not highlight any environmental adversity in the proposed project.
The counsel challenged the appellants’ locus standi, arguing that they were not directly aggrieved by the proposed project, while they did not highlight any adversity by the proposed cutting of trees or air pollution, etc, in their appeals.
He maintained that with the construction of the Malir Expressway “we will have primary advantage that Western portion of the metropolis is connected through bypasses, but there is no such bypasses connectivity in the Eastern corridor. Therefore, this project will connect the city with far-flung parts including Korangi Industrial Area, the Defence Housing Authority and other areas on the outskirts”.
Advocate Pinjani argued that at present the average daily commuting time in the Eastern corridor was 90 minutes, adding that with the construction of the Malir Expressway this commuting time would be reduced to 30 minutes on average day. 
“The overall impact is positive for the metropolis, since this is not any commercial or residential project, but a highway,” he added.
The company’s lawyer further highlighted that around 1,800 trees coming in the way of the expressway were to be cut down, but Sepa had advised to grow 19,000 trees — three rows of trees cover on either side of the expressway — to maintain environmental balance in the area.
Lastly, the counsel submitted that the project currently costing Rs27 billion, out of which 72 per cent is publically funded since it’s a consortium of banks and the Sindh government.
He opposed the appellants’ requests for granting an interim stay order against any construction activity at the site, and cautioned that if due to any technical reasons the project was stayed the costs would spiral up given the growing rate of inflation.
He pleaded the tribunal not to consider any technicalities while considering the project overall to the environment. He pleaded to dismiss the appeals for being devoid of merits.
However, the appellants’ counsel, Kazim Hussain Mahesar and Muhammad Imran Kalmati, once again made a request to the tribunal to pass an interim stay order, restraining the respondent firm from carrying out construction work on the river bed, saying it was causing serious hazardous to the environment. 
They requested that any sort of construction in the area might be stayed till the final disposal of the appeals.
However, the tribunal did not pass any order on the stay application and directed Sepa counsel to advance final arguments on the next date.
The location of the project, as per the EIA approval, is starting from right before the Jam Sadiq bridge on Korangi Road and run along the right bank of the Malir river through the Korangi and Malir districts, terminating on M-9 near DHA City outside Karachi.

4,Major opposition parties want army deployed at polling stations for Sindh local govt elections,"Accuse ECP of staying silent on order of deploying police from interior areas of Sindh in Karachi, Hyderabad on polling day.","KARACHI/HYDERABAD: Fearing violence and attempts of rigging in the upcoming local bodies’ elections in Karachi and Hyderabad the key contesting parties on Wednesday shared their reservations with state institutions and demanded deployment of Pakistan Army and Rangers at polling stations.  
They also questioned the role of Election Commission of Pakistan and accused it of staying silent on the order of deploying police officials from the interior areas of Sindh in Karachi and Hyderabad on the polling day and described the decision as a move from the ruling Pakistan Peoples’ Party to “execute its evil agenda”.  
Addressing a press conference in Hyderabad, Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf Sindh chapter president Syed Ali Zaidi demanded deployment of paramilitary troops in local bodies’ elections and called for declaring all polling stations ‘sensitive’ in the Hyderabad division.
He also claimed to have sent a letter to Provincial Election Commissioner (PEC) Sindh in this regard.  
“The Election Commission is unable to hold elections in a peaceful manner in first phase and conditions in by-poll of NA-240 were before everyone. Only eight per cent turnout of voting was recorded in NA-240. Violence marred that by-election leading to deaths of two people. Now LG elections would be held in nine districts of the Hyderabad division and seven districts of the Karachi division. Fears are high again,” he said.  
He accused PPP’s Asif Ali Zardari of trying to bargain over people’s conscience in Lahore. He alleged that after “stealing money from Sindh”, the same was being used in Lahore to buy loyalties of people. He said the Sindh government remained absent during rain devastations and destruction was thrust upon Karachi. 
JI rejects private security guards 
Rejecting the idea of deploying private security guards, Jamaat-i-Islami Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman in a press at Idara Noor-i-Haq in Karachi called for deployment of Army and Rangers at polling stations under Article 245 of the Constitution.  
He also expressed concerns over the attitude of the PPP government in Sindh and said that the private security guards and “politically corrupt recruitments in the Sindh police department” might be used by the PPP to get results of their own choice.  
“We demand the Election Commission to rectify the polling lists and appoint impartial returning officers. The Election Commission’s silence over the sheer violation of the code of conduct, including the political administrator, flawed voter lists and development work to show off and lure voters is a matter of serious concern for us,” added Hafiz Naeem.  
PSP sees test case for ECP 
In his press conference, former Karachi mayor and chairman of Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) Mustafa Kamal said after the Punjab by-polls, the Karachi local bodies’ elections had become a test case for the ECP.  
“Now it’s the primary duty of the Election Commission to ensure free and fair elections in Karachi and Hyderabad,” he said.  
“But unfortunately the Election Commission is so influenced by the PPP here. How the ECP can treat Sindh and Punjab differently? Here we see the police personnel from rural Sindh have been called for security and everyone knows that the Sindh police are actually a security wing of PPP,” he said.  
“I ask the state institutions how long PPP will be given clean chit in the name of reconciliation?”

5,Final part of Anwar Maqsood’s Aug 14 ready to entertain theatre lovers,"KARACHI: A decade ago, it came as a pleasant surprise to know that popular satirist Anwar Maqsood had penned a play...","KARACHI: A decade ago, it came as a pleasant surprise to know that popular satirist Anwar Maqsood had penned a play for the extremely demanding world of theatre. It was called Pawney 14 August, directed by Dawar Mehmood of Kopykats Productions. This was the time when theatre had begun to take root in Karachi with the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) putting up dramas produced by its faculty and students. 
Since Maqsood was exploring a hitherto unchartered territory for him (at least on a larger scale) the public went in droves to see the play. It was a resounding success, primarily because of the rib-tickling, no-holds-barred one-liners that the writer specialises in. 
As can be gauged from the title, the story drew on the chequered political history of Pakistan. The project was followed by Sawa 14 August and now the third and final part of the series, Saadhay 14 August, will be staged next month from, no points for guessing, Aug 14.
Produced to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Pakistan, the makers of the play have no qualms in giving away to the media the storyline of Saadhay 14 August: “The plot of the live-action performance revolves around two characters Jinnah and Gandhi who get the people’s views on the great divide between Pakistan and India. Jinnah and Gandhi visit four places (Kashmir, Lahore, Delhi and London) to gather people’s reactions and fight a case against the allegations of whether the divide was a good decision or not. In the past, Jinnah and Gandhi never wanted a divide but simply desired freedom from the British. The two leaders agreed on the Muslim Government in Muslim majority regions, but Nehru didn’t agree and eventually, the solution was a subcontinent divide into two countries, India and Pakistan.”
Surely, it can’t be that straightforward a tale. 
Talking to Dawn on Wednesday, Anwar Maqsood explained, “Yes, it primarily focuses on Jinnah and Gandhi but there is in the story, for a short while, W Churchill as well. He is miffed and wonders since he wasn’t prime minister at the time of partition, why people in the subcontinent blame him for it. He says people abuse him in Urdu [not knowing] he is familiar with the Urdu language. One thing leads to another and the characters reach a court of law where the judge asks Jinnah and Gandhi to go to four places and seek people’s opinion on the matter.”
The reason Maqsood has been writing these pieces moving one quarter, or half way, around the date Aug 14 is that for him Aug 14, the day, is yet to come. 
Another point that he makes about it is that our younger generations aren’t aware of the events that led to the partition of India.
The promo for Saadhay 14 August was released on July 16 generating a fair amount of interest in the play directed by Dawar Mehmood, which will be staged at the Arts Council of Pakistan Karachi.

6,"Over 37,000 policemen, 3,000 private guards to be deployed for Karachi LG polls",City police chief unveils security arrangements for local govt elections,"KARACHI: Additional Insp­ector General of Police Javed Odho on Wednesday said that a contingency plan had been prepared for the local government elections in Karachi, under which, a total of 37,861 policemen would perform election duty.  
Speaking at a press conference at his office, the city police chief added that out of total election duty force, 24,968 would be posted at polling stations and 5,010 would work as quick response force while 4,438 personnel would be deployed as anti-riots reserve force.  
At the start of his press conference, Mr Odho touched upon the issue of recent ethnic tensions in Karachi and Hyderabad and expressed the view that the police had controlled this ‘atmosphere of ethnicity’ with better policing and engaging leaders of both the communities while dealing with miscreants with iron hand.  
He said the Election Comm­ission of Pakistan had established a total of 4,996 polling stations in Karachi and none of them was ‘normal’.  

City police chief unveils security arrangements for local govt elections

A total of 1,246 polling stations have been described as highly sensitive while 3,750 termed as sensitive where eight and four policemen, respectively, would be deployed at each PS.  
He said during elections, law and order problem used to emerge on account of various reasons and for this purpose, over 500 teams of policemen had been set up, which would reach at any disturbed place within five to 10 minutes to meet any eventuality.  
In addition to the policemen, 3,000 private guards/scouts would also be deployed.  
As many as 2,000 police mobiles would be patrolling during the polls.  
Responding to a question about violence during recently held by-election on NA-240 in Korangi, the city police chief said out of total 309 polling stations, law and order problem was reported from three PS only.
He admitted that at present, there was a ‘tension’ between certain political parties and they would resolve those issues to ensure peaceful LG polls.
He said there was an ethnic issue, which had been dealt in a better way with use of force and engaging ‘peaceful’ elements of both the communities. “There is no outstanding issue in this regard,” claimed the Karachi police head.
He pointed out that a total of eight cases pertaining to violence and riots, etc, had been registered under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and around 100 ‘miscreants’ had been arrested and efforts were under way to arrest absconders. “We are in touch with peaceful leaders of both the communities while we are chasing the miscreants.”  
Mr Odho said that there was a wrong ‘perception’ that crimes in the metropolis had increased and claimed that the data of CPLC showed that street crimes, particularly snatching and lifting of motorbikes had decreased around eight per cent recently. 
Ban on display of arms 
The city police chief said that Section 144 of the criminal procedure code had been imposed under which display of arms would be banned during the polling and party leaders facing ‘real’ threats would be provided police guards, but they would not be allowed to carry private guards.  
Mr Odho said that Rangers would help them in maintaining law and order while Pakistan Army would remain as a standby.

The JI leader said that everyone, all people including the transgender community, should benefit under him.
“The transgender community should not be seen as separate segment of the society, but rather as human beings and as citizens of Pakistan. They have the same rights as any other person here. So we will also work for them as we did during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic when JI workers distributed food rations among them,” he pointed out.
Reminding of the biggest JI women sit-in at Hassan Square in January, he said that it should tell the people how important the party felt about the role of women for this city and this country.

Hafiz Naeem shares election manifesto with women journalists

“The issues faced by the city such as waste removal, water scarcity, transport, etc, equally affect women. The JI has a charter, which includes women. We want to empower women. We don’t want women workers here working for third party contractual companies. We want them to get equal pay as men. JI will be their voice,” he said.
Hafiz Naeem also said that they wanted to have dedicated recreational parks for women. He said that they already worked on skill development programmes for women. “We teach women in jail. We teach them English. We teach them Chinese,” he said.
He also said that the JI had a clear-cut agenda regarding transport facilities for women. “We need safe and reliable transport for women in Karachi. Today, it is a pain watching women travel in crowded buses. They are pushed, they are harassed. The JI will have nothing of it. There is a need for separate transport for women with women drivers and women conductors, which we will get for them,” he said.
He said there were 800 to 900 Karachi Metropolitan Corporation schools that came under the mayor of Karachi. “We will make them model schools. No one may remember it now, but there used to be a time when people used to line up outside government schools for their children’s admissions. We want our children to have a level playing field. Why should the rich only have a good education system?” He questioned.

He said this while addressing the passing-out parade of 561 assistant sub-inspectors at the Police Training Centre, Shahdadpur.
He also hinted at establishing anti-terrorism units at Shahdadpur and Razzakabad so that selected policemen could be given specialised anti-terrorism training. 
“Once these trained policemen are on the ground, we will be able to handle terrorists on different fronts such as espionage and operation,” he added.

Passing-out parade of 561 ASIs held

“We have commandoes, anti-riot and anti-dacoits specialised training units at our police training centres but we do not have anti-terrorism training units, which are the need of the hour. Therefore, such units must be established so that anti-state elements are dealt by the police professionally,” he said.
The programme was hosted by Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon and PTC principal Munir Khuhro. MPA Shahid Thahim and other notables as well as family members of ASIs attended the programme in a large number.
Mr Shah addressing the ASIs being passed said that the policing was a sacred profession because the policemen protect life and property of the people.
The chief minister said that the 561 male and female ASIs would now wear uniform to perform their duties in the field. “You have to maintain the sanctity of your uniform and you have to enhance the dignity of the police service through your professional approach in handling different kinds of cases,” he urged.
He said that his government had introduced most modern and latest methods of police trainings by employing highly professional trainers of army.
“We have enhanced the salaries, allowance and compensation for martyrs’ families and in the new budget we have upgraded pay scales of the police. On top of that, selection of policemen is made purely on merit, therefore the newly recruited/trained policemen have to prove themselves as an asset of the department and the society,” he said.
Earlier, the chief minister inspected the passing-out parade of the ASIs and distributed medals, certificates and anno­unced one basic pay to the position holders in the training. 
The newly trained ASIs demonstrated their professionalism by conducting a mock police encounter with dacoits and protesters.
Speaking on the occasion, IGP Memon said that in 1994 then chief minister Syed Abdullah Shah, the father of the incumbent CM, had visited the Shahdadpur PTC and upgraded it to the level of a training college. 
He added that the then CM Abdullah Shah had established a firing range at the PTC, which was in shambles now. At this, the chief minister said that it would be reconstructed.
At the conclusion of the passing out parade programme, the chief minister visited MPAs Shahid Thahim at his residence where he held a meeting with party leaders and workers.
Speaking on the occasion, the chief minister said that the party workers were assets of the party.
