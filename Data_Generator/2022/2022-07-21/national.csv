0,Punjab ‘takes precedence’ as Imran puts off Karachi visit,"PTI MNA from Sindh says ex-PM’s absence ""definitely hurts momentum"" of party campaign; Imran to reach Lahore today.","KARACHI: Expecting it as a major and final push to their campaign for the upcoming local government elections in the city, local leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) faced a setback to know that party chairman Imran Khan postponed his Karachi visit ahead of Punjab’s chief minister election tomorrow even before the ECP announced postponement of polls owing to Muharram and rainy weather.
Before the postponement of polls in Sindh, a PTI spokesman insisted that it was the party’s consensus decision that Mr Khan should focus more on Punjab and because of this he couldn’t spare two days — July 21 and 22 — for Karachi and Hyderabad.
He claimed that the PTI was already in quite a strong position in the two cities and key party leaders, including Asad Umar, Murad Saeed, Ali Muhammad Khan and Qasim Khan Suri, were already here to energise workers and build up the momentum.
Though PTI’s leaders and legislators in Karachi stayed firm with the reason given by the party for Mr Khan’s shelved visit, they sounded deeply disappointed and unconvin­ced with the explanation given by the party.

PTI MNA from Sindh says ex-PM’s absence ‘definitely hurts momentum’ of party campaign

“It definitely hurts the momentum,” said a PTI MNA from Sindh. “It obviously dents the campaign. It’s not only about workers and leaders at Karachi level. It’s more about millions of people who were expecting him to be here among them just days before the voting. We were expecting that back-to-back rallies and addresses by the chairman would turn this momentum into votes and bring an easy win for the party.”
Another legislator avoided expressing any disappointment directly, but agreed that the campaign for the local government elections would not get that “last sixer”, which could have multiplied the turnout and pulled PTI voters out of their homes on the polling day.
“As a sketchy plan, on the night of July 21, Mr Khan had to address a rally in (Karachi’s) District Central, followed by fireworks, and then the next day [on July 22], he had to stroll around the city to make speeches at least at three major points,” he said. “Grassroots workers were pumped up and every young voter was excited. They don’t deserve this.”
Critics say that the decision from the PTI — which emerged as the single largest party to win the heaviest mandate in Karachi with 14 MNAs and over 20 MPAs after the 2018 general elections — to put off Mr Khan’s visit vindicated their stance that “he is indifferent to Karachi” and “least cares about the business capital”.
“This is exactly what I have been saying for a while and Imran Khan keeps proving me correct. Lahore and the rest of Punjab are more important to him than Karachi,” tweeted a PTI opponent and social media activist, sharing the party’s announcement about postponement of Mr Khan’s visit.
Imran to reach Lahore today
As the fate of the Punjab government is set to be decided on Friday, PTI Chairman Imran Khan is likely to reach Lahore today (Thursday). MNA Ali Nawaz Awan, while talking to Dawn, said the party chief had decided to remain in the Punjab capital during the CM’s run-off election.
“However, soon after the poll, Mr Khan will leave for Karachi as he wants to address at least one public meeting there,” he announced.
Meanwhile, after a clean sweep in Punjab, the PTI has hammered out a well-planned strategy to trounce its opponents in the local government elections in Sindh.
According to the PTI Central Media Department here on Wednesday, the party has given finishing touches to its preparations and public gatherings for the electoral battle in Karachi and Hyderabad.
A schedule of PTI central leaders’ visit to Sindh had been finalised, and former minister Asad Umar would lead the election campaign in Keamari, Nazimabad, Ayesha Man­zil Central and Korangi areas of Karachi.

1,Businesses decry massive jump in power rates,Nepra head at public hearing says he ‘can only sympathise’ at this stage; consumers may have to bear additional burden of Rs4-5.,"ISLAMABAD: As the government plans to increase the average national uniform power rates by almost 50 per cent to about Rs42-45 per unit in certain cases, including taxes and surcharges, the power regulator has expressed its inability to be of any help except to sympathise with consumers.
At a public hearing presided over by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) Chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui, trade and industrial bodies, mostly from Karachi, protested over such a massive price hike, saying it would lead to the closure of businesses, make exports uncompetitive and create job losses.
Mr Farooqui, however, said that while he understood the challenges to various consumer groups, he “can only sympathise” and could not extend any help at this stage.
He said the government was still providing about Rs220 billion subsidy to protect the poor segments but the demands from the business community “is beyond our pay grade” and should be lobbied at political level.

Nepra head at public hearing says ‘he can only sympathise’ at this stage

The Nepra chief said the public hearing was kind of a formality given the fact that the regulator had itself approved Rs7.91 per unit increase in average national tariff “based on ground realities”.
Instead, he warned that while determining the average tariff, the regulator had assumed the exchange rate at Rs200 to the dollar, which has already jumped to Rs225.
The regulator, he said, had expected that based on tariff rebasing, the quarterly and monthly tariff adjustments would turn negative, but all these estimates were then upside down.
Consumers may now have to bear an additional burden of Rs4-5 per unit in the shape of quarterly tariff adjustments and fuel charge adjustments in the coming months as well.
Interestingly, despite repeated questions from consumers and Nepra members about the all-inclusive rate of current and upcoming tariffs, the power division team could not confirm the average power rate after taking into account taxes, quarterly and monthly adjustments and surcharges.
Nepra tariff case officers said the average rate was slightly above Rs40 per unit while Nepra’s Sindh member Rafique Shaikh said his estimates suggested it at about Rs44-45 but lamented the power division officials were not blank on such a key thing.
Nepra was hearing the motion filed by the federal government for consumer-end tariff adjustment for K-Electric and power distribution companies previously managed by Wapda, and notification of a uniform schedule of tariff for power consumers, by incorporating targeted subsidy and inter-distribution companies’ tariff rationalisation.

2,Courts disposed of 2.25m cases since January,"The Supreme Court has alone decided 11,233 cases against an institution of 8,508 cases during January-June.","KARACHI: The country’s superior and lower judiciaries decided 4.1 million cases against an institution of 4.06m cases last year and has already disposed of around 2.25m cases against the filing of around 2.13m new cases during the first six months of this year, the Law and Justice Commis­sion of Pakistan (LJCP) said.
According to an LJCP statement shared with Dawn, the Supreme Court of Pakistan has alone decided 11,233 cases against an institution of 8,508 cases during January-June.
“A reclining trend in the backlog of cases is evident currently, reducing the backlog to 2.1m cases (2,080,601) till June 2022 from 2.2m cases (2,162,042) in January 2021,” it said.
It stressed that Pakistan was not alone in dealing with the ballooning backlog of cases, as the issue existed across the region.
“If one looks at the statistics of neighbouring countries, it comes to light that the pendency of cases has increased manifolds [in regional countries],” it said.
The LJCP said that according to Bangladesh’s law ministry, pending cases had exceeded the 3.9m mark on Dec 31, 2020 (previously reported as 2.8m in 2014). A similarly consistent increase in pending cases has been observed in India, where, according to the National Judicial Data Grid of India, the number of pending cases has surpassed 48m.
“Considering the situation in the South Asia region, Pakistan’s situation is much better comparatively,” it said.

4,Pakistani passport remains ‘fourth-worst in world’,‘Passport Fee Asaan’ app launched to facilitate e-payment,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistani passport continues to be the fourth-worst in the world, not changing its position from a year ago and providing access to only 32 destinations, according to the Henley Passport Index for 2022.
The Henley Passport Index is a ranking of all the world’s 199 passports according to the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa, Dawn.com reported on Wednesday.
The ranking is based on data from the International Air Transport As­­s­ociation, which maintains the wor­ld’s largest database of travel information, and it is enhanced by extensive, ongoing research by the Henley & Partners Research Department.
In the newly-unveiled ranking, Pak­istan is ranked only higher than conflict-ravaged Syria, Iraq and Afgha­nis­tan, which occupies the bottom spot.

‘Passport Fee Asaan’ app launched to facilitate e-payment

The top spot has been taken by Japan, with the country’s passport providing its holders access to 193 destinations. Next in line are Singapore and South Korea, whose passports provide access to 192 countries, followed by Germany and Spain, with their passports having a visa-free score of 190.
Among other countries from Asia, India, along with Mauritius and Tajikistan, has been ranked 87th, with its passport providing access to 67 countries. China ties with Bolivia for the 69th spot, with each of their passports allowing access to 80 destinations.
As for Bangladesh, it occupies the 104th position — five spots higher than Pakistan — with its passport holders having access to 41 countries.
App for passport fee
Meanwhile, the interior ministry has launched the ‘Passport Fee Asa­an’ — an online application to help users in the calculation and payment of passport fees. The application would allow users among other things to generate a challan for the payment of the fee which could be paid through ATM, online banking, or 1-link member bank branches. The app also contains a complaint resolution mechanism to facilitate users in case of reservations.
Currently, the e-payment facility for the calculation and payment of passport fees is in a testing phase and available in Islamabad only. The nationwide services would be exte­nded within a period of six months.
Initially, the application was meant for phone users but in the final presentation, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah directed the department concerned to add the website feature to it as well.
The app was developed after PM’s Strategic Reforms Unit head Salman Sufi pointed out that a large number of applicants have to queue in banks to deposit the fee for the passport.
“We are working on adding more features to help different-abled citizens as it is difficult for them to visit the respective offices for renewal of their passports,” Salman Sufi told Dawn.
He said that the reforms unit was also working on the integration of the app to digitise immigration checks at airports and added that around 30,000 citizens will be able to take advantage of this application.

6,Five killed in operation belonged to terrorist group: Langove,"BNP-Mengal claims five ""militants"" killed in the operation were actually missing persons.","QUETTA: Adviser to Balochistan Chief Minister on Home and Provincial Disaster Management Authority Mir Ziaullah Langove claimed on Wednesday that five of the nine killed in a recent operation conducted by security forces in Ziarat belonged to a terrorist organisation. However, he said, their names were included in the missing persons’ list prepared by the Voice of Baloch Missing Persons organisation.
The operation was carried out near Ziarat last week against the killers of Lt Col Laiq Baig Mirza and his cousin.
Mr Langove’s remarks come against the backdrop of a claim by the BNP-Mengal, National Party and some Baloch nationalist groups that five ‘militants’ killed in the operation were actually missing persons and that they had gone missing after having been picked up allegedly by security forces. Expressing concern, these parties called for an investigation into the killings.
Speaking at a press conference here, Mr Langove said that on July 12, Lt Col Laiq and his cousin Umar Javed had been kidnapped and later martyred by the banned BLA militants in Ziarat. The adviser descri­bed the act as against Balo­­ch and Islamic traditions.
He said members of Levies Force and police officers were being targeted by the banned organisation and their poor families were severely affected by such incidents.
The adviser said a major operation had been conducted in Ziarat area by security forces after Col Laiq’s murder.
During the operation, he said, an officer of an intelligence agency had been martyred. He said that of the nine terrorists, five had been identified because their names was included in the missing persons’ list.
He said the state’s position was clear on the issue as many of the missing persons were fighting against the state, adding that those who had attacked the Karachi Stock Exchange and those involved in attacks in Nushki and Panjgur were also on the list of missing persons.

• Fawad Chaudhry demands arrest of Asif Ali Zardari, Rana Sanaullah and Attaullah Tarar over ‘horse trading’
ISLAMABAD: Confident that the party will rule Punjab after the July 22 election for the chief minister, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Wednesday constituted a committee to identify police and administrative officers who it claims committed “criminal” offences against its leaders and workers, to initiate legal proceedings against them once the party takes over the reins of the province.
The five-member committee, headed by senior leader Shafqat Mehmood, will identify officers responsible for allegedly torturing PTI workers on May 25 and lodging cases against them and the leadership during the party’s long march on Islamabad that it suddenly wrapped up before reaching its destination. Other members of the committee are Aamir Mehmood Kiani, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Aon Abbas Buppi and Raja Basharat.
PTI central secretary general Asad Umar issued a notification for the anti-victimisation and accountability committee — formed as per a decision of the PTI core committee — which was tasked with investigating “fake” cases registered against party leaders in Punjab and working towards countering them.
The committee would also identify the officers who committed “criminal” offences against the PTI leaders and workers in order to initiate legal proceedings against them.
Asad Umar, in a post on social media and a press statement, asserted the PTI had not forgotten the incidents of May 25. “We have not forgotten, and will not let anyone else forget,” he added.
He said those responsible for the “torture and harassment” of PTI workers and leaders would be dealt with as per the law, adding they had filed a contempt petition with the Supreme Court against Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and the Punjab government.
The former minister claimed the blatant attempts to “interfere” in the CM’s election process, use of police and Special Branch and open threats by the interior minister were a clear contempt of the SC’s July 1 verdict.
Fawad demands arrest of Zardari, Rana, Tarar
PTI senior vice president Fawad Chaudhry on Wednesday lashed out at PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari for resorting to the “dirty practice” of horse trading, and called for the arrest of the former president, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Punjab minister Attaullah Tarar for allegedly offering Rs400 million to the opposition party’s MPAs to buy their votes.
Addressing a press conference on Wednesday along with senior PTI leaders Aamir Kiani, Usman Dar and Zulfi Bukhari, Mr Chaudhry said horse-trading had started ahead of the Punjab chief minister’s election on Friday, which was a bad omen for democracy.
He claimed the loyalty of their MPAs was being bought for over Rs400m each.
He said though the PTI had the support of 188 lawmakers in the Punjab Assembly, the count could reach 190 as the court had ordered a recount of votes in Rawalpindi and Muzaffargarh constituencies.
He added the PTI and PML-Q were confident their candidate, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, would become the CM comfortably.
The former minister apprehended that Mr Zardari had flown PTI MPA Masood Majeed to Turkiye after paying the lawmaker Rs400m, alleging the former president was using the Sindh government’s resources for horse-trading, but the Election Commission was doing nothing about it.
He went on to claim that Atta Tarar was also attempting to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs and had offered them Rs250 to Rs300m each. Rana Sanaullah had also hinted at creating hurdles in the PTI’s way to form the Punjab government, he added.
“We are moving the Supreme Court, which is the only institution to ensure transparency,” Mr Chaudhry said, adding he would submit a petition in the court on Thursday (today), demanding Zardari, Tarar and Rana Sana be arrested and the apex court conduct an immediate inquiry into the matter.
Fawad claimed the rate to buy a lawmaker’s loyalty had increased from Rs350m to Rs450m after PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain announced his support for Parvez Elahi, adding the PTI MPAs who had been offered money had instantly informed the parliamentary party.

8,IO gets to submit final charge sheet in Dua ‘kidnap’ case,Investigating officer says Karachi police team has already left for the arrest of purported groom Zaheer.,"KARACHI: A local court on Wednesday allowed time to an investigating officer (IO) to submit a final challan in Dua Zehra case, after fresh investigation revealed that the teenage girl was kidnapped from Karachi and got illegally married to Zaheer Ahmed in Punjab.
Dua’s purported husband Zaheer, his mother and 20 other relatives, and cleric Hafiz Ghulam Mustafa have been accused of allegedly kidnapping the underage girl from Karachi, shifting her to Punjab and solemnising her illegal child marriage.
On Wednesday, when the matter came up before Judicial Magistrate (East) Aftab Bhugio, IO DSP Shaukat Ali Shahani was supposed to file the final challan against the detained and absconding suspects.
On the last date, while rejecting a “C” class investigation report filed by the IO seeking cancellation of the case, the magistrate had told him to further investigate the matter, besides directing the provincial health secretary to ensure fresh ‘age estimation test’ of Dua Zehra to determine her actual age.
At the outset, IO Shahani moved an application stating that a Karachi police team had already left for Lahore to arrest the purported groom, Zaheer, and other suspects, who had allegedly facilitated and arranged the child marriage and sheltered the couple afterwards.
He further submitted that Zaheer and other fleeing suspects could not be arrested so far and requested for a 10-day time to enable the police to arrest and bring them to Karachi to complete the investigation and subsequently file the final challan.
On the other hand, the state prosecutor informed the court that a sessions’ judge had on July 20 ordered the additional IG (investigation) to change incumbent investigating officer Shahani. However, he said, such order of the court had not been received by the police high-ups.
He undertook that the investigation into the case would be transferred from IO Shahani to any other honest and competent officer in compliance with the court’s order, once the same is received by the police’s investigation department’s chief. Until then, the court should adjourn the hearing, he pleaded.
Granting requests by the prosecutor as well as IO Shahani, the magistrate allowed time to the police high-ups to submit a final challan on the next date and adjourned the hearing till August 1.
Contrary to its previous claim that the case pertaining to Dua’s kidnapping and child marriage was false, IO Shahani had told a sessions court on July 16 that the teenage girl was not only kidnapped from Karachi, but also shifted to Lahore, where Zaheer solemnised illegal child marriage with her.
A day ago, the sessions judge had ordered the AIG (investigation) to transfer the case’s investigation from IO Shahani for being “unprofessional and incompetent” and entrust the same to a competent and trained police officer of DSP rank who has the experience of investigating such cases.

11,Pakistan removed from child soldiers list,Pakistan was placed on the list for providing “material support to non-state armed groups that recruited and used child soldiers”.,"WASHINGTON: The United States has also removed Pakistan from a list of countries that allow the recruitment of child soldiers.
On Tuesday, the US State Department upgraded Pakistan on another list of states that do not take adequate steps to curb human trafficking — removing it from a watch list of potential violators.
Pakistan was placed on the Child Soldiers Prevention List (CSPA) in 2021.
The 2021 report accused Pakistan of providing “material support to non-state armed groups that recruited and used child soldiers”.
The previous report also claimed that the Pakistani government did not report investigating, prosecuting, or convicting individuals of child soldiering offences in 2021.
It urged Pakistan to “cease support to non-state armed groups that recruit and/or use child soldiers”.
The State Department also noted that in April 2019, the Pakistani military announced it would bring more than 30,000 religious schools under the government’s control, some of which non-state armed groups used to forcibly recruit child soldiers.
The 2022 CSPA List includes governments of the following countries: Afghanistan, Myanmar, Central African Republic, Congo, Iran, Mali, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen.
The CSPA prohibits assistance to governments that are identified in the list under the following authorities: International Military Education and Training, Foreign Military Financing, Excess Defence Articles, and Peacekeeping Operations, with exceptions for some programmes undertaken pursuant to the Peacekeeping Operations Authority. The CSPA also prohibits the issuance of licences for direct commercial sales of military equipment to such governments.

“PML-N is suffering because it is following the advice of Zardari,” he said, claiming that Punjab during the rule of PTI’s Usman Buzdar “outperformed” Sindh being ruled by Mr Zardari’s PPP.
The comments came at a time when he is present in Lahore holding meetings to woo lawmakers ahead of the crucial election for the post of the Punjab chief minister on July 22.
Mr Qureshi alleged the government was using money to buy loyalties of PTI MPAs ahead of the CM election as incumbent CM Hamza Shehbaz had lost the majority following the defeat of the PML-N in by-polls.
“Maryam said they accepted defeat with open heart … [then] why are they using money and why institutions like IB [Intelligence Bureau] are active [against PTI leaders],” he asked.
About the numbers game, he said the PTI had enough lawmakers to get Mr Elahi elected as the new CM. “If our numbers are less, then why is the government making offers [to PTI MPAs],” he said.

14,Kidney institute to get funds for free medication to transplant patients,KP health secretary says all issues of IKD will be resolved,"PESHAWAR: Health department is going to resolve the longstanding issue of shortage of funds for free provision of medicines to patients after renal transplants at Institute of Kidney Diseases (IKD), Hayatabad Medical Complex.
“We have convened a meeting to resolve the issue of funds for the subsequent medication of post-transplant patients today. The meeting will be attended by officials of finance and health departments besides the present and former directors of IKD,” Health Secretary Amir Sultan Tareen told Dawn.
According to him, the government has been providing funds for free medication to all patients after transplantation but the finance department wants that the medication should be given to only those people, who undergo procedures at IKD.
“We will set criteria for free medication to resolve the issue. IKD is part of HMC, a medical teaching institution but the government wants to help the patients, who deserve free medicines,” he said.

KP health secretary says all issues of IKD will be resolved

The health secretary said that a proper mechanism was being devised to help the poor patients and save the money from being wasted. 
“Additionally, the meeting will also hold detailed discussion regarding resumption of renal transplants at IKD and extra funds for the purpose,” he said.
The institute had stopped renal transplants two years ago and now wants to re-start the procedures to facilities patients.
In February this year, IKD told the health department through a letter that it had 1,200 registered patients, who received medicines after transplants on monthly basis and on average 50 to 60 patients visited the nephrology OPD on daily basis where they weren’t only given free anti-rejection drugs after a long process of their clinical evaluation.
The letter said that patients were also subjected to battery of tests and were given drugs as per investigation. It said that the patients were checked by consultants. It added that the cost of investigation was about Rs10,000 per patient that was burden on the institute.
It said that in future, the cost of investigation should be addressed. In case of rejection, the cost of treatment was beyond Rs500, 000. Each year, 120 new patients were registered. Therefore, the provision of funds should be made on sustainable basis not on ad hoc basis, it added.
The letter also said that free medication to only poor patients from Zakat fund should be allowed and only the people undergoing transplants at IKD should be made entitled to the free services as it was huge constraint on health budget to facilities all the patients undergoing transplants anywhere.
Sources in IKD said that in response to many letters for provision of funds, Rs30 million was released in December last year by the government against the demand of Rs122 million. 
The process of providing free medicines to kidney transplant patients was resumed on February 4, 2022 that lasted for two months, they added.
They said that since April 11, the patients were not getting free drugs. The patients, who underwent renal transplants in the past and required subsequent medication, were at the receiving end due to non-availability of medicines and the life-saving drugs were expensive and not affordable for most of the people, they added.
The patients needing dialysis on monthly, fortnightly or weekly basis continue to suffer for want of drugs. IKD has been providing free medicines to patients since launching renal transplants and they receive cashless medication on monthly basis.
Sources said that in the past two years, the programme of free medicine had been suspended several times due to insufficient funds.
However, the health secretary said that all the issues of IKD would be resolved. 
“The government wants to ensure free medication to post-transplant patients as well as resume transplants at the institute,” he added.

15,PHC stays work on Bannu water schemes as contract challenged,Notices issued as petitioner claims rules violated,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has issued a stay order suspending work on two water schemes in Bannu district and directed the local deputy commissioner and the relevant Kaki tehsil municipal administration to respond to a petition, which challenged the contract over the alleged violation of rules.
A bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim issued notices to the Bannu DC and Kaki TMA for response and directed them to maintain status quo on the matter until next hearing.
Pir Hameedullah Shah, lawyer for petitioner Shafiullah, a contractor, contended that the Kaki TMA had sought bids for water schemes through newspaper advertisements.
He said that his client had submitted a bid for two of the schemes in which the ratewas 10 per cent lower than the cost of schemes, while the bid of another contractor, Mohammad Younas, was 11 per cent lower than his client’s.

Notices issued as petitioner claims rules violated

The lawyer said that under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules, a bidder had to deposit two per cent bid security for participating in the auction.
He added that under the rules, if a bidder submits a bid, which was less than 10 per cent of the total cost, then he had to deposit additional eight per cent as bid security.
The counsel argued that contractor Mohammad Younas had to deposit eight per centcall securityunder the rules but he didn’t do so.
He added that the rules declared that if a contractor failed to deposit that bid security, then his two per cent security deposit had to be confiscated by the government, whereas the contract had to be awarded to the next lowest bidder.
The lawyer contended that the TMA had violated those rules and awarded the contract to Mohammad Younas. He said the cost of both schemes was Rs50 million. The counsel requested the court to declare that contract illegal and order its award to his client.
CONVICTED: A local court has convicted a man on the charge of possessing crystal meth (ice drug) and awarded him 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs500,000.
It also declared that in case of the non-payment of fine, the convict should serve one- year more jail term.
Additional district and sessions judge Mohammad Faisal pronounced that the prosecution had proved its case against the accused, Faheem, a resident of Takhtbhai area in Mardan district, while the evidence on record connected him with the commission of the offence.
The accused was arrested by officials of the Paharipura police station on Aug 10, 2021, and was charged under Section 11-B of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substance Act.
The state prosecutor contended that the police had recovered a shopping bag with 220 grammes of crystal meth (ice drug) from the possession of the accused.
He argued that the chemical examination report and the statements of prosecution witnesses clearly proved the guilt of the accused.
