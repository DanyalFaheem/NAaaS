0,Court clips Public Accounts Committee's wings in probe against NAB DG,PAC power to order reopening of cases challenged in IHC; Tayyaba Gul’s lawyer allowed to argue on plea to become party in case.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday restrained the most powerful parliamentary committee — Public Accounts Committee — from probing serious allegations against the director general of National Accountability Bureau (NAB) about strip searching and filming a female suspect.
After preliminary hearing of a petition filed by NAB DG Saleem Shahzad, Justice Aamer Farooq issued notice to the PAC secretariat and stopped it from taking any adverse action against him.
In a related development, the NAB DG appeared before the PAC and informed the member parliamentarians that despite having a court order in his favour he appeared before the committee to prove his bona fide and his respect for the committee.
While defending the accusations against him, the official claimed he was unnecessarily dragged into the harassment case on an application moved by the woman, who he alleged was involved in immoral activities and booked in around 40 cases in different districts. He blamed the woman, Tayyaba Gul, for harassing him.

PAC power to order reopening of cases challenged before IHC; Gul’s lawyer allowed to argue on plea to become party in case

In her application before the same court, Gul requested the acting chief justice to implead her as necessary party in the petition filed by the NAB DG. The court asked her counsel to advance the arguments on the next date.
Earlier on July 7, complainant Gul while appearing before the PAC alleged she had been treated inhumanly not only by NAB chairman Javed Iqbal and NAB DG Saleem Shahzad but also by the Prime Minister Office that had secured personal gains by blackmailing the NAB hierarchy by misusing a high-profile compromised video.
Gul alleged that the NAB DG retired major Saleem Shahzad arrested her from Islamabad and took her to Lahore where she was subjected to strip search and was also filmed. She accused the PM Office of using an indecent video secretly recorded to pressure NAB chairman to shut certain inquiries.
The PAC subsequently summoned the DG and directed the NAB chairman to suspend him and his staff, besides issuing a direction to the anti-graft watchdog to reopen the inquiries that had been closed due to the alleged blackmailing.
However, the DG moved the IHC against the PAC direction and Justice Farooq after preliminary hearing retrained the PAC from taking any adverse action against him.
Interestingly, acting NAB chairman Zahir Shah also moved the IHC challenging the PAC jurisdiction to issue direction of revival of the closed cases.
Since the registrar office of the court had administrative objections to the petition, Justice Farooq asked counsel for the NAB to remove the objection within a couple of days.
In the petition, the acting chairman of NAB had claimed that the PAC had exceeded from its jurisdiction and requested the court to declare the PAC’s directives of July 7, 2022 as void.
While appearing before the PAC on Wednesday, Mr Shah later claimed NAB’s prosecution wing had opined to file a petition before the court to seek guidance on reopening of closed inquiries.
The PAC members expressed displeasure over filing of petitions to ‘avoid accountability’.
PAC chairman Noor Alam Khan said he could present himself before the anti-graft watchdog for “ruthless accountability” and the NAB should also be willing to face accountability. He asked why NAB was avoiding accountability of a person who not only misused his authority but also sexually harassed a woman.
Mr Khan was of the opinion that NAB, its chairman and officials were well respected, but the PAC could not tolerate the alleged ‘misuse of authority’ and ‘woman’s harassment’ by them.

In a statement following the meeting, the election watchdog said the local government polls will be held on August 28 instead of July 24 whereas the election on the NA-245 seat will be held on August 21 instead of July 27 due to possible rainy weather and Muharram which is expected to start later this month.

2,Indian top court grants bail to Alt News’ Zubair,NEW DELHI: India’s Supreme Court on Wednes­day ordered the release on bail of a prominent journalist arrested ...,"NEW DELHI: India’s Supreme Court on Wednes­day ordered the release on bail of a prominent journalist arrested last month over what police said was a “highly provocative” 2018 tweet aimed at straining ties between majority Hindus and minority Muslims.
Mohammed Zubair, a co-founder of fact-checking web­site Alt News and vocal critic of Indian Prime Minis­ter Narendra Modi, was arrested after an anonymous Twitter user lodged a complaint over the four-year-old post.
While granting Zubair bail, the judges stated that “power of arrests must be pursued sparingly”.
The court stated that while investigations can continue, there was no justification for keeping Zubair in custody.
Zubair’s lawyer had earlier said the case bordered on the absurd, because Zubair had used satire from a Hindi-language movie in his 2018 tweet and there was no evidence that he had hurt religious sentiments of Hindus.
Zubair and his colleagues accused the federal government of using the police to silence the voice of journalists and other critics.
Earlier this year, Zubair had drawn attention to an incendiary remark about the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) made on TV by a spokesperson for Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
Zubair’s lawyer said the government was using the 2018 case to punish him after this year’s tweet went viral.
India is ranked 150th on the 180-country World Press Freedom Index, compiled annually by Reporters Without Borders.

3,Crisis-hit Sri Lanka gets new president,"‘Our divisions are now over’, Wickremesinghe says in brief acceptance speech before parliament","COLOMBO: Six-time prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was elected as crisis-wracked Sri Lanka’s new president in a parliamentary vote on Wednesday, with the backing of the disgraced former leader’s SLPP party.
Official results gave the veteran politician 134 votes, an absolute majority in the 225-member parliament, after Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country and resigned in the wake of protesters overrunning his palace.
Wickremesinghe’s main opponent in the vote was SLPP dissident and former education minister Alahapperuma, 63, a former journalist who was supported by the opposition and received 82 votes.
The third candidate, leftist Anura Dissanayake, 53, was embarrassed when the final tally showed that the pile of rejected votes was one more than the three he polled.

‘Our divisions are now over’, Wickremesinghe says in brief acceptance speech before parliament

But 72-year-old Zarook, a retired seaman who gave only one name and lives in Slave Island, an impoverished area of the capital, was indifferent to the result.
“If Ranil comes, if another man comes, we have to do our daily jobs. So we don’t care,” he said. “Our divisions are now over,” Wickremesinghe said in a brief acceptance speech in parliament, urging his defeated rivals “to join me and work together to bring the country out of the crisis we are facing”.
Wickremesinghe takes charge of a bankrupt nation that is in bailout talks with the IMF, with its 22 million people enduring severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine. But he was backed by the Rajapaksas’ SLPP party — still the largest in parliament — and is despised as a proxy for the former leader by the protesters who forced him from his palace after months of demonstrations over the unprecedented economic crisis.
They have also been demanding the departure of Wickremesinghe, who has pledged to crack down hard if protesters take to the streets.
Hundreds of heavily armed troops and police stood guard outside the parliament, but there were no signs of demonstrators.
Outside the presidential secretariat, where protesters camped for months to demand Rajapaksa step down, actress Damitha Abeyrathne, 45, said: “We lost. The whole country lost.” The struggle would continue, she said.
“The politicians are fighting for their power. They are not fighting for the people. They have no feeling for people who are suffering.”

4,Sunak or Truss set for battle to be Britain’s next PM,"‘Hasta la vista, baby’, says Boris as he bows out of parliament","

PRIME Minister Boris Johnson leaves from 10 Downing Street on Wednesday to head to the Houses of Parliament for the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions session.—AFP

 
LONDON: Conservative rivals Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, offering competing answers to Britain’s multiple crises, will duel in the coming weeks to become the next prime minister after the party’s lawmakers held a concluding vote on Wednesday.
Former finance minister Sunak, a centrist offering fiscal rectitude alongside promises of renewed integrity following outgoing leader Boris Johnson’s scandal-tarred tenure, again led the field with 137 votes in Tory MPs’ fifth and final ballot. The crucial race for second place was narrowly won by Foreign Secretary Truss, on 113 votes, against 105 for trade minister Penny Mordaunt.

‘Hasta la vista, baby’, says Boris as he bows out of parliament

Sunak and Truss now take their case to Conservative party members, who will decide the new leader and prime minister after a dozen nationwide hustings and several televised debates over the next six weeks.
At his last Prime Minister’s Questions session in parliament earlier, Johnson bowed out by saying “Hasta la vista, baby!”. In a hint of support for Truss’s Thatcherite platform, he urged his successor to “cut taxes and deregulate where you can to make this the greatest place to live and invest”.

5,Israel distances itself from TV report on Makkah,"Minister denounces report by journalist who entered Makkah despite ban on non-Muslim visits as ""harmful"" to Israel-Gulf ties.","JERUSALEM: An Israeli minister on Wednesday denounced as ‘stupid and harmful’ to Israel-Gulf ties a TV report by a journalist who entered the holy city of Makkah despite a ban on non-Muslim visits and who apologised for the event after an online backlash.
Israel’s Channel 13 News aired a 10-minute report from Saudi Arabia by its journalist Gil Tamary on Monday, in which he was travelling in a car by holy sites.
Tamary was accompanied by a person who appears to be a local guide.
“I’m sorry (but) it was a stupid thing to do and take pride in,” Israel’s regional cooperation minister Esawi Freij, who is Muslim, told public broadcaster Kan. “It was irresponsible and damaging to air this report just for the sake of ratings.”
Freij said the report hurt US-encouraged efforts to gradually move Israel and Saudi Arabia towards more normal ties, similar to the 2020 diplomatic deals with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
Riyadh does not recognise Israel, saying this would require addressing Pales­tinian statehood goals first.



 
Tamary’s visit also trended on Twitter after the report was aired.
One Twitter user wrote, “Shame on you Channel 13, for hurting the religion of Islam like that. You are rude”.
Saudi media did not cover the story and officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Tamary was in Jeddah covering US President Joe Biden’s visit on Friday. It was unclear how Tamary entered the holy city despite a ban. Tamary later apologised for his act, saying he had not intended to offend Muslims.
“If anyone takes offence to this video, I deeply apologise,” he wrote in English on Twitter.

6,"Al Qaeda, IS gaining strength in Afghanistan: UNSC report","Says both groups can attempt to strike in region’s non-conflict areas; Al-Qaeda chief living, communicating freely in Afghanistan.","• Both groups can attempt to strike in region’s non-conflict areas
• Al-Qaeda chief Zawahiri living, communicating freely in Afghanistan
• With around 4,000 foreign fighters, TTP presents a greater threat to the region
• IS seeks expansion in region beyond Afghanistan for realisation of its ‘great caliphate’ project
ISLAMABAD: Transnational terrorist groups Al Qaeda and the self-proclaimed Islamic State are growing in strength in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and could potentially pose threat for the outside world, a recently launched United Nations report warned.
The 30th report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, set up under UNSC Resolutions 1526 and 2253, has taken a look at the activities of Al Qaeda, the militant Islamic State (IS) group and other terrorist groups in Afghanistan and the wider region and concluded that Al Qaeda and IS’s threat remains high in conflict-hit regions and the neighbouring countries though both of these terrorist groups could attempt to strike in non-conflict areas.
Though the report covered the activities of the terrorist groups in different parts of the world, but Afghanistan, which hosts one of IS’s most thriving networks and Al Qaeda, has been of special interest especially in view of Taliban takeover, whose first anniversary will be observed next month.
“The situation in Afghanistan remains complex,” the report noted, adding that terrorist groups based in Afghanistan view Taliban’s military success as a “motivating factor” for propaganda in neighbouring countries and other parts of the world.
Read: Growing terrorism threat
Al Qaeda and IS pose varying level of threats to international peace. IS-Khorasan, the group’s Afghanistan-based chapter, is being seen as a bigger threat in the short and medium term, while Al Qaeda is a danger over the long term.
Sanaullah Ghafari alias Shahab al-Muhajir, an Afghan national, has been leading IS-K chapter since June 2020.
However, IS core has set up a separate structure called Al-Siddiq office under Sheikh Tamim al-Kurdi alias Abu Ahmed al-Madani for pursuing the group’s regional agenda.
The report says IS views Afghanistan as a base for expansion in the wider region for the realisation of its “great caliphate” project and is trying to recruit fighters from other terrorist groups, besides luring disaffected Taliban fighters and dissatisfied local ethnic minorities. The group, moreover, attracts fighters by offering higher wages than other militant groups operating there.
IS-K, the report points out, has increased its presence in northern and eastern Afghanistan. The group that initially started by recruiting members of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan and Afghan Taliban now has in its ranks fighters from Central Asia, who have increased activities in the north, which borders Central Asian states of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.
In April, IS-K claimed to have fired rockets into Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Both countries denied having been hit by those rockets, but the report cautions that risk of such attacks remain.
Read: The frontiers of conflict
Citing an unnamed member state, the report further warns that if IS-K expands towards east, which borders Pakistan, then it could acquire a “global threat capability” from Afghanistan.
Al Qaeda, meanwhile, is enjoying a comfortable stay in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime and some of its senior cadres are providing advisory services to the de facto government there.
“Al Qaeda leadership reportedly plays an advisory role with the Taliban, and the groups remain close,” the report states.
Aiman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan
It, moreover, confirms that Al Qaeda chief Aiman al-Zawahiri is living in Afghanistan and communicating freely.
The proof that Al-Zawahiri was alive comes from the video messages issued by the group. “Al-Zawahiri’s apparent increased comfort and ability to communicate has coincided with the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan and the consolidation of power of key Al Qaeda allies within their de facto administration,” it maintains.
Al Qaeda’s traditional strongholds in Afghanistan have been in the south and east of the war-ravaged country, but recently it appeared to be expanding its footprint to the west to the Farah and Herat provinces and possibly to the north.
The report underscores that Al Qaeda is not an immediate international threat from its safe haven in Afghanistan because it lacks an external operational capability and does not currently wish to cause the Taliban international difficulty or embarrassment.
TTP, which is currently holding peace talks with Pakistan government, is said to be the largest grouping of foreign terrorist fighters in Afghanistan, with a strength of 3,000 to 4,000 fighters. In one of the member state’s assessment, TTP is now more cohesive and presents a greater threat to the region.
