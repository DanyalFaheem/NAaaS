Warholm may have been behind one of the most iconic moments in Olympic history when he smashed the 29-year-old world record to win the 400m hurdles at the Tokyo Games in a time of 45.94sec.
But the 26-year-old came to Eugene on the back of a hamstring injury which ultimately put paid to his medal attempt here.
Instead, Dos Santos ran the third fastest time of all time and a championship record of 46.29sec to win gold ahead of Americans Rai Benjamin and Trevor Bassitt.
“It’s pretty awesome to win the world title on this track. I didn’t care about the time because this is the first time I win a world title,” said Dos Santos.
Warholm led coming into the home straight but seized up badly and eventually came in seventh (48.42), breaking a winning streak of 22 races, including 18 finals, dating back to September 2018.
“It was a very tough race,” Warholm said.  “I had an injury but to me it’s always your fight and giving your all and leaving it all on the track.
“I felt I did that. I hope looking back I’ll feel proud of that even though I prefer to take a medal.”
Whilst everyone knew Warholm was coming back from injury, serious hopes were pinned on Olympic champion Jakob Ingebrigtsen in the men’s 1500m.
But Wightman had not read the script, playing the Norwegian at his own game by kicking with 200 metres to run and holding his form through to the line.
Wightman sealed victory in 3min 29.23sec, Ingebrigtsen taking silver in 3:29.47, with Spaniard Mohamed Katir claiming bronze (3:29.90).
In a bizarre twist, Wightman’s father Geoff is in Eugene doing the in-stadium commentary.
Geoff, also his son’s coach, was reduced to a cracked voice as he announced to Hayward Field:  “That’s my son and he’s world champion.”  “For him to be part of my journey to get to this point, and actually part of the the actual race itself is so unique,” Wightman said of his father.
“I talked to him and he’s very happy. I’m glad he showed some emotion.” Following on from Norway’s Olympic gold medallists in failing to nail a world title was 2019 champion Daniel Stahl, the Swede eventually finishing fourth in the discus.
Australian Eleanor Patterson won high jump gold in the fourth final of the night with 2.02m on countback from Ukraine’s Yaroslava Mahuchikh, Italian Elena Vallortigara taking bronze.
“I’m honestly speechless right now,” Patterson said afterwards.  “I’m already starting to get sore cheeks from smiling.”
Day five of action at the world champs also saw newly-crowned 100m champion Fred Kerley fail to advance from the semi-finals of the 200m.
Kerley set off smoothly from the blocks but was left grimacing as he hit the home straight at Eugene’s Hayward Field, eventually finishing sixth in 20.68 seconds.
Kerley later said he had cramped up in the later stages of the race, but insisted he would be fit to race in the relays.
“Bit of cramp, but it’s all good,” Kerley said.  “I’m not in pain, I’ll be good.”
While Kerley was left digesting a disappointing early exit, there were no such worries for defending 200m world champion Noah Lyles, who romped home in his semi-final with a blistering 19.62sec.
The main threat to Lyles’ hopes of retaining his 200m world title may well come from teenage team-mate and emerging rival Erriyon Knighton. The 18-year-old prodigy blazed home to win his semi-final in 19.77sec.
In the women’s 200m, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce kept her bid for a sprint double on track as she sailed into the final.
Fresh from winning a record fifth world 100m title, Fraser-Pryce timed a season’s best of 21.83 seconds in the third of three semi-finals.
Joining the 35-year-old, a world 200m champion in 2013, in Thursday’s final will be her two teammates who helped snatch an unprecedented cleansweep of the 100m podium for Jamaica on Sunday, Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah.
Alongside the trio of Jamaicans in the final will be Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith, the reigning world 200m champion who was fourth in the 100m, Americans Abby Steiner and Tamara Clark, Niger’s Aminatou Seyni and Switzerland’s Mujinga Kambundji.

The snooker activities at the global level, that were halted due to Covid-19 pandemic, are in full bloom whereas home cueists have been waiting for competitive events since long.
It is disappointing that the domestic circuit for men was slashed to mere one competition from four long ago and no sincere effort has been made by the Pakistan Billiards and Snooker Federation (PBSF) to consolidate the base by staging more events.
Apart from the country’s premier national snooker championship, the PBSF used to organise three national ranking events for men that kept the players competitive. Unfortunately, except for a ranking contest patronised by the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), other three were shelved for want of sponsors.
Thanks to the hard work of cueists who have kept snooker a medal-winning sport but unfortunately, the PBSF has not marketed it properly.
The NBP came to the rescue of PBSF by converting its ranking event into the national snooker championship last year and doled out Rs3 million in this regard.
It is pertinent to mention that a tobacco company incurred millions of rupees and played a vital role to promote the game when it was in its infancy stage while an insurance firm filled the gap following the global decision to ban tobacco companies from patronising sports.
The four provincial bodies and Islamabad remain inactive for most part of the year and mainly organise provincial cups which serve as qualifiers for the nationals. However, for the last few years, the PBSF has been organising national junior events in Islamabad.
The PBSF has not yet included Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan in its fold, a stance which has denied players of these regions the opportunities to demonstrate their talent.
Prize monies and allowances of players also need to be enhanced considerably following inflation which will help in attracting more talent towards the sport.

Speaking during a press conference here at the media centre of the Pakistan Sports Complex, Yaqoob informed that the league, besides providing volleyball players with better earning which would help improve their performance, would see two foreign players in each participating team.
The PVF chief further said the league comprising six franchises was likely to be held in Sialkot and Islamabad.
According to Yaqoob, the PVF had chalked out a comprehensive players’ development programme aimed at qualification for the 2028 Olympic Games.
“We have signed a three-year agreement with Engro, which besides being title sponsors for the league, will also help us promote the game in the country,” he said.
Currently, the PVF head said, the national Under-20 team was attending a training camp in Wah for its participation in upcoming events.
“Next month, Pakistan is due to participate in three mega events — the Asian Junior Volleyball Championship in Bahrain, the AVC Cup in Thailand and the Islamic Solidarity Games in Turkey,” Yaqoob stated.
He said the PVF had also decided to hold competitions at grossroots — at club and regional levels, adding that there was no dearth of raw talent in Pakistan.
The PVF chairman added that the federation was also planning to host an international event featuring eight Central Asian countries from Nov 20 to 27 in Islamabad.
“The PVF has also decided to take part in the bidding process for holding the Asian Volleyball Championship next year,” Yaqoob said.

Reliance Industries Limited, which owns IPL’s most successful team Mumbai Indians, bought the Newlands franchise of the league which is scheduled to get underway in January next year.
The owners of IPL heavyweight Chennai Super Kings purchased the Johannesburg franchise while JSW Sports, which owns Delhi Capitals, bagged Pretoria.
The owners of IPL’s Lucknow Super Giants, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals successfully bid for the Durban, Gqeberha (formerly Port Elizabeth) and Paarl franchises respectively. 
“This is truly an exciting time for South African cricket; the overwhelming interest shows that the country remains valued in the global cricketing eco-system,” league commissioner Graeme Smith said in a statement. 
“The strong sports background of the respective owners and the global brands they manage ensures that South African cricket and the broader industry will benefit from their expertise and resources, as they bring stability and experience to the league.   
“We have already contracted a number of leading international players who will be announced shortly,” added the former South Africa captain.
Three IPL franchise owners — of Kolkata, Rajasthan and Punjab — also own teams in the Caribbean Premier League.
The Kolkata franchise is also involved in the franchise-based Major League Cricket in the United States.
NBA player Chris Paul and NFL duo Larry Fitzgerald and Kelvin Beachum invested in the Rajasthan franchise earlier this year.
IPL’s media rights for the next five years sold for a staggering $6.2 billion last month.

4,Nida’s all-round show hands Pakistan victory over Ireland,Her sparkling 15-ball 26 helped Pakistan post 92-5 in 14 overs.,"BREADY (Northern Ireland): Nida Dar’s all-round performance led Pakistan women to a 13-run win over Ireland women on Duckworth-Lewis (DLS) method in the rain-interrupted match of the tri-nation series here at the Bready Cricket Club on Tuesday.
Chasing a revised 97-run target in 14 overs, Ireland’s openers gave their team a 55-run start in 7.4 overs. After the departure of opener Rebecca Stokell (19 off 24 balls, three fours), the Pakistan bowlers applied breaks on the run-chase. With three overs remaining, the hosts needed 31 from three overs.
Ireland scored seven runs from the 12th over while losing Orla Prendergast (10 off 12) to off-spinner Nida, caught by Iram Javed. Nida ended up with match figures of 3-0-17-1. In the next over, left-arm spinner Anam Amin gave away only five runs and Pakistan got the wicket of Laura Delany (1) who was run out.
With 18 runs required in the final over, Fatima Sana conceded only four runs as three three wickets fell – two of them run-outs. Mary Waldron was dismissed lbw for nought by Fatima, while Gaby Lewis (47, 41 balls, five fours) and Arlene Kelly (1) ran themselves out.
Earlier after winning the toss, Bismah opted to bat first. Nida’s sparkling 15-ball 26 helped Pakistan post 92-5 in 14 overs.
The target was revised to 97 after Pakistan lost six overs due to rain interruption which stopped play after the sixth over. When the match resumed it was curtailed to 14 overs per innings. The start of the match was also delayed by 60 minutes because of rain.
Player of the match Nida smashed three fours and one six while knitting a 40-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Ayesha Naseem (14 off 17, one six). Opener Muneeba Ali top-scored (29 off 24, four fours). Ayesha and Nida were dismissed by Jane Maguire, who ended up with match figures of 3-0-14-2.
Scores in brief:
PAKISTAN 92-5 in 14 overs (Muneeba Ali 29, Nida Dar 26; Jane Maguire 2-14, Laura Delany 2-25); IRELAND 83-6 in 14 overs (Gaby Lewis 47; Tuba Hassan 1-10, Fatima Sana 1-12, Nida Dar 1-17).

Dybala, who was linked with a transfer to Serie A side Inter Milan after his deal with Juventus expired, has signed a three-year contract with Roma.
The deal is worth 6 million euros ($6.14 million), Italian news agency ANSA said.
The 28-year-old won five league titles and four Coppa Italia trophies with Juventus after joining them from Palermo in 2015, scoring 115 goals in 293 appearances across all competitions.
However, his last two seasons with the Turin-based club were hampered by a string of injuries.
Dybala, who has earned 34 caps for Argentina since his senior debut in 2015, will become Roma’s fourth signing of the transfer window after the arrivals of midfielder Nemanja Matic, goalkeeper Mile Svilar and defender Zeki Celik.

6,Van der Dussen-inspired Proteas deny Stokes farewell ODI win,CHESTER LE STREET: Rassie van der Dussen scored a classy century as South Africa secured a 62-run victory in...,"CHESTER LE STREET: Rassie van der Dussen scored a classy century as South Africa secured a 62-run victory in sweltering heat in the first One-day International to spoil England all-rounder Ben Stokes’ farewell party at Chester-le-Street on Tuesday.
After electing to bat, the tourists amassed 333 for five in their 50 overs, boosted by a career-best 134 from Van der Dussen as he put on 151 with Aiden Markram (77).
The home side made a strong start to their reply but South Africa kept chipping away at the wickets through the middle overs. Despite an eye-catching 86 from 77 balls from Joe Root, England fell well short of their target as they were bowled out for 271.
It was not the send-off Stokes would have wanted on his retirement from ODIs, returning bowling figures of 0-44 in five overs and scoring just five with the bat at what is his home county venue.
“We are used to the heat but it was quite dry and windy as well today,” Van der Dussen said at the post-match presentation.
“We batted well and our bowlers executed beautifully. We knew we had to play smart cricket, we are happy with the performance but we will see where we can improve.”
Van der Dussen was the anchor for South Africa’s innings as he read the conditions perfectly on a wicket that became harder to bat on as sun baked it.
England made a strong start to their reply as Jason Roy (43) and Jonny Bairstow (63) put on 102 for the first wicket but the tourists spinners put on the brakes on the wearing pitch and fast bowler Anrich Nortje (4-53) returned late in the innings to remove Root in the 45th over, signalling the game was up.
Stokes could not perform the heroics that have been his trademark through a glittering career as he was trapped leg before wicket by part-time spinner Markram (2-25).
The second of three matches in the series will be played at Old Trafford on Friday.
“It was a tough day, but the effort from the guys was outstanding to field in that heat. It was a good toss [for South Africa] to win,” England captain Joss Buttler said.
“You need to take wickets to stem the flow of runs in this format. We never managed to impose ourselves with the bat as the wicket got lower and slower. South Africa read the conditions well.”
There was more bad news for England on Tuesday as fast bowler Mark Wood told Sky Sports he will need another surgery on his injured elbow, raising doubts about his participation in the T20 World Cup in Australia that begins in October.

7,Pakistan ace record Galle chase after Abdullah masterclass,GALLE: Abdullah Shafique struck an epic 160 not out in a fourth innings masterclass to anchor Pakistan’s record...,"GALLE: Abdullah Shafique struck an epic 160 not out in a fourth innings masterclass to anchor Pakistan’s record chase of 342 at Galle as the tourists won a thrilling opening Test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday. 
Pakistan began an intriguing final day needing 120 runs with seven wickets in hand to go 1-0 ahead in the two-Test series. They went on to accomplish their second highest successful chase riding Abdullah‘s career-best knock, which included seven fours and a six. 
The opener capped his marathon display with the winning runs in the final session on day five, jumping for joy and pumping his fist as Pakistan triumphed by four wickets. 
“As a youngster, he showed his class and temperament,” Pakistan captain Babar Azam said of Abdullah whose 480-ball vigil earned him the man-of-the-match award. 
Pakistan also jumped ahead of Sri Lanka in the World Test Championship standings with only South Africa (71.43%) and Australia (70%) above them. 
Left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya took a match haul of nine wickets but his efforts were in vain as the visitors battled past the previous best chase in Galle of 268 by Sri Lanka against New Zealand in 2019. 
The 22-year-old Abdullah excelled with his second Test ton. He built crucial partnerships including a 101-run third-wicket stand with Babar, who made 55 after his 119 in the first innings on a tricky pitch to bat on.  
“We know how to play spin so we believed,” Babar said after the tense win. “When I was batting with Abdullah Shafique we were just trying to build a partnership. He has shown his class.” 
Abdullah, who was named man of the match, said: “It was difficult but with time it was easier. Babar is one of the best in the world. We have learnt so much from him. I enjoyed batting with him in the middle.” 
Abdullah did get some reprieves. He was lucky to survive an lbw appeal when he was on four. He was dropped on 135 when Dhananjaya de Silva missed a return catch and again on 151 but deserved his luck and played the anchor’s role to perfection as he surpassed his previous Test best of 136 not out. 
A rain delay after lunch slowed down Pakistan’s push for victory with 11 runs still required, but it really was only a matter of time. 
Abdullah finally combined with Mohammad Nawaz, 19 not out, to take the visitors home. The teams had taken early tea before returning for the third session of play. 
Pakistan had a few anxious moments after Jayasuriya, who sent back talisman Babar before the close on day four, struck at the stroke of lunch to get debutant Salman Ali Agha caught behind for 12.  
Hasan Ali fell for five in the second over of the second session after being promoted up the order to hit out the remaining runs. 
Jayasuriya, who took 12 wickets on debut in a series-levelling Test win over Australia last week at the same venue, six in each innings, kept up the pressure but Abdullah stood firm. 
Jayasuriya was Sri Lanka’s best bet on a worn-out pitch and the left-arm spinner, who claimed 5-82 in the first innings, began the proceedings for the hosts on the final day.  
He nearly struck with the first delivery of the day which breached Mohammad Rizwan’s (40) defence but somehow missed the stumps.  
The spinner repeatedly beat the bat but had to wait for success.  
Sri Lanka wasted both remaining reviews challenging not-out decisions against Abdullah and Rizwan off Jayasuriya’s bowling. 
Rizwan opened his day’s account with a boundary off Ramesh Mendis and kept up his positive intent by taking singles and twos before Jayasuriya (4-135) finally broke the 71-run stand, dismissing Rizwan lbw with a ball that kept low and went straight. 
A review did not save Rizwan, a wicketkeeper-batsman who has come into the two-match series after a successful stint with English county Sussex. 
Salman and Hasan fell cheaply but Sri Lanka’s faint hopes of an unlikely victory evaporated when Kasun Rajitha dropped Abdullah at deep square leg. 
After rain intervened, Shafique sealed Pakistan’s victory with a boundary when play resumed. 
“As a bowling unit, we need to give more support to Prabath,” Sri Lanka captain Dimuth Karunaratne said of his lead spinner, who toiled for 95.2 overs in the two innings combined. “He did a really good job... he bowled in the good areas and didn’t give any loose balls.” 
The second Test starts Sunday, also in Galle, after it was moved from Colombo due to the political unrest in Sri Lanka.

8,Inam gunning for more  CWG glory but Olympic  gold remains ultimate dream,Pakistan’s star wrestler has never been to the Olympics.,"KARACHI: For all that he’s achieved in his storied career, Inam Butt doesn’t make any attempt to hide what Olympic glory would mean to him. 
Having risen from the dusty ‘akharas’ of Gujranwala to become a two-time Commonwealth Games gold medallist, Pakistan’s star wrestler has never been to the Olympics. 
There was heartbreak last time out for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, postponed by a year due to Covid-19, where Inam couldn’t qualify after training setbacks and a loss in the Asian qualifiers in Kazakhstan. 
For that, he’d also moved up in the weight class to 97kg instead of the 86kg category in which he’d won the Commonwealth Games gold in 2018. 
With the next Olympics in 2024, Inam’s immediate aim is to defend his Commonwealth crown in Birmingham next month. That, he believes, will be his first step towards making his Olympic bow at the Paris Games in two years. 
“The first target is the Commonwealth Games,” Inam told Dawn in a telephone interview on Tuesday night. “Right now I’m just setting small targets. We have the Islamic Solidarity Games immediately after the Commonwealths. Then there are the world championships, the Asian and World Beach Games as well as the Asian Games next year. 
“The Olympics come after that and good performances in the preceding events will set the tone for Paris. The ultimate aim is to win an Olympic gold. It’s a dream for any athlete and I’m no different.” 
Inam is due to compete at the Commonwealth Games on Aug 5, when the preliminary rounds all the way to the final are scheduled. There is a short turnaround from that as the Pakistan contingent will head to the Turkish city of Konya for the Islamic Solidarity Games which are set to begin from Aug 9.
“It’s a challenge for us as the Islamic Solidarity Games are coming immediately after the Commonwealth Games,” Inam, who won his maiden Commonwealth Games gold in 2010, said. “We have to maintain our weight class for the Birmingham Games and then do the same for the Konya so there is no time to step back and relax.” 
There have been better training arrangements for the twin events than for the Olympic qualifiers but Inam stressed that more needs to be done. 
“With the pandemic raging, we were too slow in setting up a bio-secure bubble to continue with the training,” rued Inam as he looked back at missing out on the Olympics. “Other nations were quick in ensuring that training for the Olympics didn’t suffer but we couldn’t do anything. 
“We were lagging behind and that’s what made Olympic qualification difficult for us. When we got to Kazakhstan, we’d missed several events and were naturally far behind. 
“This time, the Pakistan Sports Board has organised a training camp for the last three months and the Pakistan Olympic Association as well as the Pakistan Wrestling Federation has been generously supporting us. 
“We have an internationally qualified coach in Farid Ali training us. However, what we’re missing this time around — unlike the last Commonwealth Games — is international training and competitions. 
“Last time, we trained in Iran for the Commonwealths where we had the opportunities to go up against wrestlers there. Just like any other sport, there is a lot of innovation in wrestling. There are new techniques that you get to learn in international competitions. But nonetheless, I and the other wrestlers are willing to give our best.” 
The Commonwealth Games will also offer Inam — who won the World Beach Games gold in 2019 — a chance to test how far or how close he is to Olympic qualification. 
“There are wrestlers from India who are recent Olympic medalists,” Inam informed. “There are also some good wrestlers from Canada, Nigeria, South Africa and Australia so it’s a good opportunity for me to see where I stand.” 
While Pakistan has had several Commonwealth Games wrestling gold medallists, it has never produced an Olympic gold medallist in the discipline. Its solitary Olympic medal is a bronze won by Mohammad Bashir at the 1960 Games in Rome. 
Inam, however, remains keen on changing that. He will be 35 by the time Paris Olympics come around but he says “age is just a number”. 
“If I keep myself fit, I don’t see why I can’t have a crack at the 2028 Olympics [in Los Angeles],” he said. “All we [the wrestlers] need are good facilities and sparring partners.” 
If he fails to deliver that elusive gold in his career, Inam vows he will work on producing an Olympic wrestling gold medallist from Pakistan. 
“You have to realise that one day my time will be over,” he said. “That’s why I’ve set up an academy to train up-and-coming wrestlers. If I can’t do it myself, the aim is to raise someone who can deliver that gold.”

9,Babar Azam says Abdullah Shafique headed for the top,Abdullah hit an unbeaten 160 to steer Pakistan home in a record chase of 342.,"GALLE: Pakistan skipper Babar Azam on Wednesday said that Abdullah Shafique can become one of the world’s best Test openers after his epic century against Sri Lanka in Galle.  
Abdullah hit an unbeaten 160 to steer Pakistan home in a record chase of 342 at the picturesque venue as Pakistan won a tense opening Test in the final session on day five.  
The 22-year-old batted for just under nine hours and five sessions against a spin attack led by the in-form Prabath Jayasuriya, who took a match tally of nine wickets. 
“As a youngster, when you prove yourself and perform in tough conditions and difficult tracks, then it’s good,” Babar told reporters. “His confidence was high after performing against Australia so he was on a different level. And to perform against quality bowling, your confidence goes up higher.” 
Abdullah, who made 136 not out against Australia in Rawalpindi in March, recorded his second Test ton in just his sixth match since making his debut last year.  
The right-handed batsman blocked, defended, drove and attacked in his 408-ball stay laced with seven fours and one six to win rich praise from the captain. 
“The way he plays, so clean and with his focus, he will get many, many more such knocks,” said Babar, who was involved in a key third-wicket stand of 101 with Abdullah to set up the chase. 
“I hope that he becomes one of the best openers in the world.” 
Abdullah, who now averages 80 in 11 Test innings, put on 71 runs with wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Rizwan (40) and then an unbeaten final stand of 41 with Mohammad Nawaz, who made 19 not out.
The 27-year-old Babar also kept up his prolific run-scoring with a defiant 119 in the first innings and then 55 in the second to push Sri Lanka on the backfoot. 
Azam rated his century as “special” among the eight Test hundreds he has hit in 41 matches. 
“It was kind of special because the team needed it,” said Azam, who batted with the tailenders in the first innings to help the team recover from 85-7 to 218. 
“It was one of the best hundreds in Test matches [for me] because it was difficult. To play with tailenders you need double concentration to guide them and watch yourself as well. And I am happy that I did that.” 
Azam also lauded opposition spinner Jayasuriya for being their “main weapon” in just his second Test for Sri Lanka.

10,"Serena, Djokovic included in US Open entry list",Djokovic will not be able to compete due to his refusal to be vaccinated against Covid-19.,"NEW YORK: Serena Williams was included on the entry list for the US Open on Wednesday along with fellow former champion Novak Djokovic, who will not be able to compete due to his refusal to be vaccinated against Covid-19.
Serena, who returned to competition last month after a year-long absence, was added to the entry list for the Aug. 29-Sept. 11 Grand Slam in New York having been named in the draw for tune-up events in Toronto and Cincinnati.
The 23-times Grand Slam champion fell in the first round at Wimbledon and last appeared in the US Open in 2020 when the six-time winner reached the semi-finals.
Eligible players are automatically entered into the main draw but that does little to help Djokovic, who retained his Wimbledon crown last month and is one back of Rafa Nadal’s record of 22 Grand Slam titles.
Djokovic will not be able to participate in the year’s final Grand Slam due to current rules under which travellers seeking to enter the United States have to be fully vaccinated and provide proof before boarding flights. 
“The US Open does not have a vaccination mandate in place for players, but it will respect the US government’s position regarding travel into the country for unvaccinated non-US citizens,” the United States Tennis Association (USTA) said in a news release.
Almost 12,000 people have signed an online petition calling for the USTA to work with the country’s government to allow Djokovic to compete in the US Open despite his refusal to take the Covid-19 vaccine.
Djokovic won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles in 2021 but was unable to defend his Melbourne Park crown this year after being deported from Australia over his vaccination status in January.
He later said he was prepared to miss Grand Slam tournaments rather than take the Covid-19 vaccine.

11,Pogacar takes Tour stage 17 as Vingegaard stays in control,PEYRAGUDES: Tadej Pogacar claimed victory in the 17th stage of the Tour de France but it was Jonas Vingegaard who...,"PEYRAGUDES: Tadej Pogacar claimed victory in the 17th stage of the Tour de France but it was Jonas Vingegaard who came a step closer to the title as he finished on the defending champion’s wheel to retain the overall leader’s yellow jersey on Wednesday.
Pogacar’s late acceleration at the top of the final climb, a 8km effort at 7.8%, earned him his third win in this year’s Tour and gave him a 10-second time bonus.
Vingegaard, however, picked up six seconds with his second place, meaning he still leads the Slovenian by a comfortable two minutes and 18 seconds going into Thursday final mountain stage, a gruelling Pyrenean trek to Hautacam.
Geraint Thomas, the 2018 champion, again limited the damage to finish fourth behind Pogacar’s UAE Emirates team-mate Brandon McNulty and cement his third place in the general classification as the final podium took shape.
Thomas, who crossed the line 2 minutes and seven seconds behind Pogacar, lags four minute and 56 seconds off Vingegaard’s pace in the overall standings.
Thursday’s stage was yet another opportunity for Pogacar to make the Danish rider crack, but last year’s runner-up Vingegaard looked unflappable through the three category-one ascents peppering the second part of the 129.7-km ride from Saint Gaudens.
It was only in the final metres that Pogacar took a slight advantage on a ramp at 13% to take the day’s laurels but he now faces a seemingly insurmountable task with only Thursday’s stage and Saturday’s final time trial to overturn the situation.
In the early kilometres, Thibaut Pinot surged ahead, followed by Kazakhstan’s Alexei Lutsenko, in the ascent to the Col d’Aspin (12km at 6.5%) as the Groupama-FDJ rider hoped to give France their first stage win of this Tour.
They were chased by a dozen riders who were hovering 30 seconds behind and were joined by Romain Bardet after the Frenchman jumped away from the peloton near the top of the climb.
Mikkel Bjerg’s acceleration at the front of the main bunch in the Hourquette Ancizan set up a potential attack by Pogacar as riders popped out of the back like corn.
Among the casualties featured Adam Yates while Pinot and Lutsenko’s lead was slashed down to 1:20 from two minutes at the top.
The leading duo were caught by the chasing group in the early slopes of the Col de Val Louron-Azet (10.7km at 6.8%).
McNulty’s devilish pace in that penultimate climb was too much to handle for France’s David Gaudu, and then Colombian Nairo Quintana before they caught and dropped all the breakaway riders.
Sepp Kuss, the only team-mate left with Vingegaard, cracked as Pogacar’s lieutenant McNulty continued his demolition work, which ejected Thomas from the back.
Pogacar attacked near the top but Vingegaard covered easily and the duo started the final climb with McNulty one minute and 20 seconds ahead of Thomas and Bardet.
The Briton dropped Bardet in the final part of the ascent and he now leads fourth-placed Quintana by a massive two minutes and 57 seconds and fifth-placed Gaudu by three minutes and one second.
