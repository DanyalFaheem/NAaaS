0,Miftah sees economy stabilising with inflows ‘on cards’,Premier has called a federal cabinet meeting today to discuss economic and political situation.,"• Attributes slide of rupee to ‘political turmoil’
• Economic fundamentals on trade front in ‘ideal situation’
• PM briefed on financial situation as economy ‘goes south’
• Economic, political situation tops agenda as cabinet meets today
ISLAMABAD: Blaming political factors for the latest downturn in currency and share markets, Pakis­tan’s economic managers tried on Wednesday to reassure that macroeconomic fundamentals were stabilising and $8.5-10 billion inflows have been lined up from friendly countries against a financing gap of $4bn estimated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Simultaneously, econo­mic managers of both incu­mbent and former PTI governments appeared to hint at the continuation of a staff-level agreement with the IMF under an interim set-up.
While Finance Minister Miftah Ismail and senior State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) officials said the IMF had no problem working with an interim set-up, former finance minister Shau­kat Tarin also offered cooperating with a “credible int­erim government” on the continuation of the IMF programme.
Mr Ismail announced at a news conference that economic fundamentals on the trade front had been corrected to an “ideal situation”, in which exports and remittances were now financing imports, as evident from the latest numbers for the first 18 days of the current month.
He said the country had a trade deficit of $48bn and a current account deficit of $17bn last fiscal year ending June 30, but the measures taken by the current government had started showing results as imports flattened to $2.6bn in the first 18 days of July against $7.2bn in June. This means the government would be able to have about $2bn in import savings this month.
The minister said the staff-level agreement had been achieved on the IMF programme and there was no disruption to it and no chance of derailment as the government was committed to the implementation of all agreed prior actions and measures in letter and spirit before the Fund’s executive board’s approval.
With this, the inflows from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank (AIIB) have been revived.
He said the IMF estimated that despite the World Bank, ADB and AIIB support, there would be a financing gap of $4bn during the current fiscal year for which an agreement would be reached in a day or two with a friendly nation for about $1.2bn worth of oil supplies at the rate of $100 million per month.
Another friendly country would be investing $1-2bn in the stock market under a government-to-government (G2G) mechanism that had been approved by the cabinet and sent to its committee on disposal of legislative cases for vetting.
Moreover, another friendly country was expected to provide $2.4bn worth of natural gas on deferred payment and another country had promised a $2bn bank deposit.
All these supports in the form of oil, gas and deposits put together worked out at $6.6bn and would materialise in a few days and maybe some of them be announced in a couple of days during the foreign visits of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
A fourth country had offered 2bn in special drawing rights (SDR) deposits (around $2.63bn), Mr Ismail said, adding that this country had already talked to the IMF, which was currently examining the proposal for which past precedents were available in the IMF history.
The government was also considering privatising two LNG power plants at Balloki and Haveli Bahadur Shah in Punjab at about $2bn on a G2G basis, but that might take some time to materialise, he said. “So, our funding requirements are comfortably complete.”
Rupee’s slide
He said the local currency’s depreciation this week “originated from the political situation and had nothing to do with the economic situation”.
The rupee fell 2pc on Monday and 3pc on Tuesday despite last week’s staff-level agreement with the IMF. On Wednesday, the rupee further slid 1.3pc to 224.92 per dollar, having ended Tuesday at 221.99.
Mr Ismail said all currencies had depreciated against the greenback because of a “once-in-a-generation strengthening of dollar owing to US Fed’s monetary tightening”.
While the minister claimed that the political situation would stabilise over the next couple of days, he parried repeated questions over the basis of his optimism.
‘Economic shock worse than Covid’
Separately, a senior SBP official told journalists the current economic shock was worse than the Covid-19 as many things were happening simultaneously and US central bank’s monetary tightening was always painful for emerging economies and resultantly even large economies were struggling.
The SBP official said Pakistan’s trust pattern had turned very low after the Feb 28 policy reversals after international commitments and the international community was not ready this time to bail out the country before it showed results on grounds.
He dispelled the impression that the central bank was a silent spectator to the rupee’s depreciation, saying it was intervening in disorderly movement and was working with banks and taking other steps as well. “The country needs a bridge between now and until we start receiving funds” from abroad, he said.
He said a better indicator of the rupee’s strength was the real effective exchange rate — which takes into account the currencies in which Pakistan trades in inflation-adjusted terms — according to which the Pakistani currency had depreciated only 3pc since December.
PM briefed on economy
Meanwhile, the country’s economic team briefed Prime Minister Sharif as the dollar’s sharp rise had become a source of deep concern for the government.
The premier called an emergency meeting on the economic situation of the country, Prime Minister Office said Wednesday.
The meeting — held in Islamabad and attended by the economic team and top officials related to the economy — evaluated the factors for the recent hike in the dollar’s value and the measures to address it. Mr Sharif, presently in Lahore, chaired the meeting via a video link.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn the prime minister said the country’s uncertain political situation was the main reason behind the dollar’s flight.
The meeting discussed ways and means how to stabilise the rupee and expressed concern that the local currency continued sliding against the dollar despite a ban on the import of hundreds of items.
Cabinet meeting today
Mr Sharif has also called a meeting of the federal cabinet on Thursday (today) to discuss the economic and political situation. He will chair the meeting from Lahore via a video link.
According to the agenda, the meeting will discuss the multimodal air-road corridor for Afghan Transit Trade and will also make a decision on the “trade in goods” agreement with Turkiye.
The meeting will also make a decision on the transfer of amount to the government of Afghanistan for functioning/maintenance/equipment/salaries of three Pakistani hospitals.
The appointment Federal Land Commission’s chairman is also on the agenda.

1,Ministers’ alleged threats to PTI lawmakers on SC radar,Apex court to take up contempt plea against Hamza today.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court will take up on Thursday a contempt of court petition against Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz, federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb for allegedly threatening to make PTI MPAs disappear before the July 22 election for a new CM.
The petitioner — Punjab Assembly Speaker Parvez Elahi — recalled a press conference addressed by the two ministers on Monday (July 18) in which Rana Sanaullah said: “We will not let Elahi become the CM easily. If five to seven PTI lawmakers don’t come to the (Punjab) assembly on the voting day (July 22), how will the PTI have its chief minister.”
The petition was taken up by a two-judge Supreme Court bench, consisting of Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Munib Akhtar on Wednesday. Soon after the hearing started, the court asked Babar Awan, Mr Elahi’s counsel, to furnish a transcript of the press conference.
After the counsel complied with the SC order, the apex court decided to begin hearing the petition on Thursday (today).

Apex court to take up contempt plea against Hamza today

Parvez Elahi, the petitioner, accused the respondents of violating the July 1 Supreme Court order that Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz must remain within the confines of the Constitution and the law “without incidence of harassment of political opponents or witch-hunting” in the run-up to the election for next head of the provincial government on July 22.
The petitioner argued the PTI and its allies had secured a comfortable majority in Punjab Assembly after the July 17 by-elections for 20 seats and were in a position to form the provincial government.
The results have unnerved the PML-N and its cadres “are now resorting to unconstitutional and unlawful actions”.
“They (Rana Sanaullah and other PML-N officials) are hreatening to `disappear’ members (Punjab MPAs) belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and its allies,” the petition said.
The statement of Rana Sanaullah in his press conference of July 18 anounts to “obstructing implementation of the court’s order” and threatens to “deprive the people of Punjab of representation in governance”, Parvez Elahi observed in his petition.
“The threatening statements by the incumbent interior minister have instilled fear in the ranks of PTI and its allies.”

2,By-poll result on hold as ECP takes up plea for PP-7 recount today,LHC restrains returning officer from consolidating results.,"ISLAMABAD: In a significant development, the Lahore High Court (Rawalpindi bench) on Wednesday restrained the returning officer (RO) from consolidation of result of PP-7 (Rawalpindi-II) by-election, converting a petition challenging the RO’s decision to reject plea for recount into an application to be taken up by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for hearing today (Thursday).
The order was passed by the court on a petition filed by PTI candidate Shabbir Awan assailing the RO’s ‘illegal decision’ of rejecting plea for recount in PP-7 where he lost to PML-N’s Raja Sagheer Ahmed with a razor-thin margin of 49 votes amidst a controversy over rejection of more than 1,500 votes.
The petition filed by Mr Awan through Barrister Raja Jibran Tariq Ali said an application under Sec­tion 95(5) of the Elections Act had immediately been filed before the RO for recounting of votes but the same was illegally rejected by him for extraneous reasons.
It said an application under Section 95(6) of the Act had also been filed with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), which did not entertain it.
His counsel submitted that the RO had no jurisdiction or authority to reject the application of the petitioner and that he was ‘bound to recount’ the votes as per mandate of Section 95(1) of the Act. He also said that the RO did not follow the process requirements envisaged by Section 95(2) and necessary notice of consolidation of the result was not given to the petitioner.
The court order said that without going into the merits of the decision rendered by the RO, it was clear that an application filed before the ECP was not being entertained. The court issued direction to the ECP to treat the writ petition by the PTI candidate as his application under Section 95 (6) of the Elections Act and shall pass a decision thereon after granting hearing to the petitioner. “In order to streamline the process, the petitioner is directed to appear before the respondent [ECP] on July 21 at 10am when the needful shall be done,” read the order passed by Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
Till the time the ECP passed an order, the RO was restrained from consolidating the result.
Mr Awan in his petition filed with the ECP claimed the result of PP-7 had been delayed though all the presiding officers had reached the RO in time. “….the result, despite all presiding officers reaching in time, was announced late at 1:40am on 18-07-2022 whereas the results for other constituencies were announced well before 8:00pm 17-07-2022, [that] also raises questions on the counting of votes [in] the said constituency”, the petition reads.
The petitioner further claimed when the results of 265 out of 266 polling stations was uploaded on the RTS, he was in the lead of 312 votes and at the climax of the results of the PP-7 Rawalpindi-II, RTS system broke down. “After considerable time when the RTS system was restored, polling station number 63, the 266th station, was already uploaded and PML(N) candidate won by a small margin of 49 votes,” he argued.
He also narrated the story of proceedings before the RO who he said instead of issuing notice under Section 95(1) of the Act took up for hearing the plea for recount. He said the contesting candidates were asked to await result to be announced at 6:30pm but then at around 9:30pm, they were told to leave and that they would be informed of the order over the phone. The RO in the late hours then rejected the application and simultaneously issued a notice for the consolidation of result.
While talking to Dawn, PTI senior vice president and ex-minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said the RO overstepped his authority by rejecting the plea for recount though Section 95 of the Elections Act was very clear.
Terming the LHC’s decision historic, he said it was probably the eighth or ninth decision of the ECP reversed by court. “This reflects consistent malaise on part of ECP,” he added.
While claiming that a transparent recount would show PTI candidate in lead of 200-300 votes, Mr Fawad said at the very beginning of the consolidation of result proceedings, before being stayed by court, a difference of 15 votes had come to light. He was of the opinion that rejection of votes on the basis of stamps affixed by the polling staff on the back of ballot paper was incomprehensible. “How can you punish the voters and the candidates for incompetence of the polling staff?” he questioned.

3,Bureaucrats to move IHC against allowance for ‘select few’,At least 400 officers of planning and development ministry left out of notification regarding ‘executive allowance’.,"ISLAMABAD: At least 400 officers of the Ministry of Planning Development and Special Initiatives, who were left out of the notification regarding an ‘executive allowance’, announced by the federal government on Tuesday night, have decided to challenge the decision in the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The officers said the allowance was “discriminatory” in nature and against the decisions of the federal cabinet as they urged the chief justice of the Islam­abad High Court (IHC) to take notice of the notification that approved up to 150 per cent raise in the basic salaries of the officers working in the federal secretariat and the field administration of the Islamabad Capital Terri­tory. A petition, which is in the works, will be filed in the high court soon. They have also threatened to observe a pen-down strike if the issue remained unresolved.
Out of the 400 planning ministry officers who were denied the incentive, at least 150 belonged to the technical cadre and 250 to the economist cadre. Expressing reservations over the decision, they claimed they have made significant contributions to the ministry but were still ignored in the incentive package.
It may be noted here that the Ministry of Planning Development and Special Initiatives consists of several technical and economist sections which failed to meet the supposed criteria for the executive allowance.
Executive allowance
According to a notification issued by the Finance Division on Tuesday night, there will be 150 per cent (1.5 times) raise in the running basic salaries of all the government officers in grades 17 to 22 with effect from July 1, 2022. However, the ‘discriminatory’ notification excluded several officers from the technical and economist cadre of the planning ministry serving under the same roof.
After ap­proval of this allowance, the top bureaucrats are expected to get a raise between Rs150,000 and Rs200,000. This increase is in addition to the 15pc pay raise announced by the government in the federal budget passed by the National Assembly, only three weeks ago.

4,Efforts on to coax opposition MPs into abstaining from vote,PTI MPA tenders resignation; party claims lawmaker offered Rs400m.,"• PTI MPA tenders resignation; party claims lawmaker offered Rs400m
• Three opposition lawmakers claim Atta Tarar offered Rs250m each to abstain from voting; Tarar denies horse trading allegations
• Shujaat reiterates support for cousin Elahi as party candidate for Punjab top office
• Imran alleges Zardari indulging in repeat of Sindh House horse trading ‘with looted wealth’
LAHORE: The PML-N and PPP have intensified their efforts to inflict a surprising defeat on former premier Imran Khan in Punjab by making at least 10 opposition MPAs switch their loyalties for the survival of the Hamza Shehbaz-led government in the province.
In this scenario, the PTI-PML-Q MPAs from south Punjab have come under the spotlight once again amid reports of attempts to purchase lawmakers’ loyalties for hefty amounts ahead of the contest between PML-N’s Hamza and the PTI-PML-Q’s Chaudhry Parvez Elahi on Friday. Earlier, out of the 25 PTI lawmakers who defected in the favour of Hamza and were de-seated, eight belonged to the southern part of the province.
The ruling PML-N-PPP alliance on Wednesday managed to create the first dent in the PTI ranks, as an opposition MPA tendered his resignation to Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari. The PTI leadership reacted swiftly and alleged that MPA Chaudhry Masood Ahmed from Rahim Yar Khan’s loyalty had been purchased for a whopping Rs400 million. Moreover, PTI workers holding lotas in their hands reached the residence of the MPA and chanted slogans against the PML-N and PPP leadership.
“Ahmed’s resignation is just the beginning. More birds from the PTI camp will fly out and by the time the CM’s election takes place on Friday, the PTI-PML-Q alliance may not have the required strength in the assembly to install its chief minister,” a PML-N insider told Dawn.
He said since the leadership of the nine-party ruling coalition, especially PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, unanimously put their weight behind Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a huddle in Lahore on Tuesday in making ‘concrete efforts and exploring all possible ways’ to save his son Hamza’s office of the Punjab chief minister from Parvez Elahi, efforts to woo at least 10 PTI lawmakers had been intensified.
“Using all its resources, the ruling alliance will manage to get the required opposition MPAs on its side. The rulers believe since they had paid the price for taking harsh economic decisions in the form of a crushing defeat in the Punjab by-polls, they are ready to go to any extent to maintain their rule in the province. Their position will be completely compromised if they are reduced to Islamabad only,” the insider said.
On the other hand, Punjab Home Minister Attaullah Tarar has said: “In the number game in the Punjab Assembly, we are seven votes behind the PTI alliance. Politics is an art of possibilities and any surprise may come in the chief minister’s election (on Friday).”
Speaking at a press conference in Lahore, Tarar refuted the allegations of ‘buying over’ the PTI MPA against Rs400m. He claimed Mr Ahmed had resigned on April 3 for being dissatisfied with the PTI government in Punjab.
“I swear on the holy Quran that no money was offered to Ahmed,” he maintained, terming PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry’s allegation baseless. He questioned whether PML-N MPA Jalil Sharaqpuri was also bribed for resigning from the Punjab Assembly, while saying his party could take back Sharaqpuri if he decided to return.
Meanwhile, the Ghazanfar Abbas Chheena group of the PTI that had been under the party’s watch filed an affidavit with the leadership on Wednesday, saying three MPAs – Mr Chheena, Shahabuddin and Amir Inayat from south Punjab – had been approached by Atta Tarar and offered Rs250m each to abstain from voting for Mr Elahi in the CM election. Tarar denied the allegation.
As Asif Zardari extended his stay in Lahore after attending the coalition government’s meeting in Model Town on Tuesday, speculations were rife that he was using his ‘political connections’ to help the Sharifs poach PTI MPAs. Sources believe PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif had ‘endorsed’ the coalition’s move to save the PML-N’s Punjab government by causing further defections within the PTI.
The Punjab Assembly currently stands at 369 members: the PTI has 178 lawmakers and its ally PML-Q 10. The PML-N has 167 members in the house, while its coalition partners PPP seven, five independents and one Rah-i-Haq Party. Disgruntled PML-N stalwart, MPA Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, has reportedly refused to cast his vote in favour of either candidate for the CM’s post. Two seats fell vacant following resignations of PML-N MPAs – Jalil Sharaqpuri and Faisal Niazi – days before the recent by-polls in which the PTI grabbed 15 of the 20 seats.
As per the Supreme Court’s directions, a candidate for the CM office needs the support of a majority of lawmakers present during the voting session on Friday.
Former federal minister Moonis Elahi of the PML-Q said that in the parliamentary party meeting of the PML-N and its allies, 144 members were present. “Instead of keeping an eye on the PTI and PML-Q MPAs, the police and Intelligence Bureau should be tasked with taking care of the ruling coalition’s lawmakers,” Moonis suggested in a tweet.
Moreover, dispelling the reports that Mr Zardari was making efforts to convince Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain to ask his party MPAs not to support Elahi, the PML-Q president reiterated his support for his cousin as the party’s candidate for the top office of the province. “I do not need to clarify. The solution to the country’s problems lies in not getting involved in cycles of counting [votes],” he said in a statement while referring to the election for the chief minister.
Imran furious over ‘attempts to buy MPAs’
Ousted premier and PTI chairman Imran Khan on Wednesday castigated the ruling coalition for its alleged horse trading. “Today, Lahore is seeing a repeat of the Sindh House horse trading that happened in Islamabad with up to Rs50 crores being offered to buy MPAs. The main architect behind this is Asif Zardari who gets NRO for his corruption & purchases people with looted wealth. He should be jailed,” Mr Khan said in a series of tweets.
He further said: “After Fed govt toppled with stolen money from Sindh & NRO2 achieved, Certified Criminal Asif Zardari in cahoots with Sharif mafia now seeking to steal Punjab ppl’s mandate by trying to purchase MPAs. Want to ask Honourable SC are they not cognisant of the damage being wrecked? Isn’t the destruction of our democracy, Constitution & nation’s morality a fit case for Suo Moto action? Are the ‘Neutrals’ not realising how our beloved country is literally being destroyed on all fronts by the Imported govt brought in through US regime change conspiracy?”
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah told a private TV channel that if the incoming (PTI-PML-Q) government in Punjab imposed a ban on his entry to the province, he would bar PTI leaders from entering Islamabad, and no one would be able to go to Banigala (the residence of Imran Khan). PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had hinted at banning Sanaullah and Tarar in Punjab after coming to power in the province.
