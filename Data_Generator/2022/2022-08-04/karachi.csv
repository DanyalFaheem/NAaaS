1,Karachi Press Club ready to settle row with civil society activist,KPC president says action taken against Nasir over members' complaints.,"KARACHI: The Karachi Press Club (KPC) was willing to resolve the controversy emanating from a dispute with a lawyer and civil society activist that resulted in imposition of a ban on his entry into the club, provided those representing the lawyer approach the KPC officials rather than using pressure tactics. 
This was stated by KPC President Fazil Jamili about the outcry in civil society circles on the ban imposed on the lawyer, Jibran Nasir.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Jamili said: “The issue with Jibran Nasir could have been resolved earlier had Mr Nasir approached the KPC or just me, its president, to explain his side. We have our own grievances with him that he should also have had the patience to listen to just like I would have heard him out patiently.” 
“The action taken by KPC over Jibran Nasir was done after listening to our members’ complaints regarding him. It was an issue that had to be addressed,” he said, adding: “We are also not happy about what happened. But instead of sitting down to resolve the matter, Mr Nasir has made it more complicated by dragging in the civil society, etc. If we had wanted, we could also have taken this issue to journalists’ unions to form our own pressure group, but things don’t get resolved like this.”  
He recalled that the KPC had many times imposed restrictions on people including its own senior members, but those restrictions had also been reconsidered and lifted after the person in question apologised and explained his or her side.
Meanwhile, in a statement, civil society organisations stated that Advocate Nasir was a person of “strong integrity who has always upheld principles of truth and justice”.
“Press clubs are sites for democratic expression and debate for rightful causes. By gate keeping and excluding progressive voices of spokespeople for the disenfranchised, the KPC is turning into a ghetto of censorship and silencing of civil rights. The [KPC] president must revisit the principles of freedom and extend respect to citizens such as Jibran Nasir,” it said.
Also on Wednesday, the Sindh High Court Bar Association called upon the KPC to ask some of its members to confine themselves to “responsible reporting” and “desist from threatening advocates acting in the discharge of their professional duties”.

5,Murad inaugurates 330MW coal-fired power plant in Thar,"MITHI: Sindh Chief Minister (CM) Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that with the launching of a 330 MW Hubco power plant,...","MITHI: Sindh Chief Minister (CM) Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that with the launching of a 330 MW Hubco power plant, the provincial government has successfully added 990 MW coal-fired power to the national grid. 
He said that it was not only a great success, but also realisation of Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto’s dream of producing coal-fired energy to empower Pakistan with low cost and indigenous sources of energy. 
The CM was speaking at the inaugural ceremony of 330 MW coal-fired power project of Hub Power Company Ltd (Hubco) and its partners at Thar Coal Block-II. The ceremony was attended by Sindh Minister Energy Imtiaz Shaikh besides representatives of the partners in the project. 
Mr Shah said that he was proud to participate in the ceremony to celebrate transmission of electricity from Thar Energy Limited utilising Thar coal. He congratulated Hubco and its partners Fauji Fertilizer Company Ltd (FFC), China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and also the project team on its completion despite multiple challenges. 
Murad Ali Shah said his government had always considered Thar to be cornerstone of the energy security for Pakistan and had taken all necessary steps to ensure that the dream of Shaheed Muhtarma Benazir Bhutto was implemented. “Her vision has been vindicated as Thar coal prices are two to three times lower against the imported lignite while saving billions of dollars in foreign exchange,” the CM said and added that the Sindh government became a major shareholder in the first Thar coal mining company — Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) — and also provided financial guarantee required by Chinese lenders to achieve financial close of the mine. 
Mr Shah said his government had provided continuous support to the independent power producers (IPPs) using Thar coal as well as mining companies, besides provision of necessary infrastructure, including roads, bridges and on top of it Mai Bakhtawar airport so that those projects could function smoothly. “We are also aware of the water requirements for Thar power projects and have made arrangements to ensure uninterrupted water supply for power generation,” Murad Shah said and added the key driver for development of Thar was the welfare of local population.  
Mr Shah said the development of Thar coal had also brought positive changes in the life of local people as substantial activities related to corporate social responsibilities (CSR) were being carried out in the fields of employment, education besides medical facilities by mining and power generation companies through the Thar Foundation. 
The CM said he was also working to ensure ramp up of mine quickly and utilization of Thar coal for energy needs of other industrial sectors, including those of cement, fertilizer and others. “We are also working closely with the federal government to develop a rail link for mass transportation of Thar coal,” he said and added that the rail link project would start soon. 
Mr Shah said the Thar Energy Ltd was a 330 MW coal-fired power project based on Thar coal. It was part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he added. 
The project is a joint venture among Hubco, FFC, CMEC and had been completed at a cost of $520 million It may be noted that foreign financing for the project was arranged from a Chinese syndicate led by the China Development Bank whereas local financing has been arranged via a syndicate led by Habib Bank Ltd (HBL). 
The project started construction in May 2018 from sponsors’ equity without waiting for financial close to ensure earliest utilisation of indigenous Thar Coal. The financial close of the project was achieved in January 2020. The plan experienced delays due to slow speed in loan disbursement from Chinese lenders and later due to Covid-19 pandemic. 
The project is now in commissioning phase and the chief minister formally switched it on to synchronise it with national grid today, August 3, whereas its commercial operation date is expected between Aug 20 and 28. 
On the occasion, Hubco chairman Habibullah and CEO Kamra Kamal also spoke and highlighted the issues they faced in launching the project. 
Earlier, the chief minister visited the power plant and its control room where he clicked the computerised-controlled power plant to synchronise it power generation with the national grid.  
With a click of mouse, the CM sent 40 MW in the national grid and by the end of August, total 330 MW power would be added to the national system.

He was presiding over a meeting of deans, administrative officers and principals of affiliated colleges of Hyderabad held to discuss different issues, including educational standards, in affiliated colleges on Wednesday.
He said initially 10 people were appointed in the SU examination department and the staff increased subsequently due to increase in the number of colleges and enrolments there. Over 200 employees were working in those departments, he said.
He said those talking about the transfer of colleges affiliated with the SU were not ready to transfer those employees from the university. “Due to non-receipt of grant from the Higher Education Commission, salaries and pensions were not paid even by Aug 3,” he said. “If teachers continue to be transferred from colleges and posted elsewhere these programmes may be affected,” he said. He said teachers should be posted on a permanent basis in colleges to run BS programmes.
He said 80,000 students were enrolled in the SU affiliated colleges of which 30,000 were studying in the colleges of Hyderabad only. But the SU press release did not explain whether 30,000 were studying in Hyderabad district or division. The VC asked what would be left with the SU if the colleges of Hyderabad were given to other university. 
He said the university interested in getting colleges of Hyderabad would have to receive 109 employees working for those colleges in the SU. 
He said the World Bank gave Rs70bn to the HEC, saying that the degrees of BA, BSc, MA, MSc and MPhil should be abolished and replaced by AD, BS and MS. He said Rs 4.5bn were spent annually on salaries and pensions of 1900 individuals. The VC said that due to increase in salaries and pensions, financial burden upon the university had increased to Rs600m annually while the provincial government increased grant by Rs200m.
Principals of different colleges of Hyderabad, Yaqoob Chandio, Prof Altaf Memon, Haq Nawaz Abbasi, Prof Saeeda Parveen, Syed Sohail A. Tahiri and others said that neither the Government College University (GCU) Hyderabad had permanent faculty members and infrastructure nor academic disciplines to grant affiliation to the colleges. 
They said the SU was the oldest university which would not be allowed to be pushed towards financial crisis by assigning the colleges to the GCU.
Deans faculties of Natural Sciences, Engineering and Technology, Education Pharmacy, Islamic Culture, Social Sciences and others were also present. They said that no academic atmosphere and faculties were there in the GCU Hyderabad.
GCU VC
GCU Vice Chancellor Prof Tayyeba Zareef told Dawn that the jurisdiction of GCU Hyderabad was established under The Government College University, Hyderabad Act 2018 which said that the jurisdiction would be notified by the government. “I have approached the Sindh government for notifying the jurisdiction of the GCU Hyderabad and it is up to government to notify the jurisdiction accordingly,” she said.
She added that the university had around 70-member faculty inclusive of 33 PhD scholars and M. Phil scholars. “It is a huge figure for any newly established university,” she said. She added that colleges could only be affiliated with the GCU once its jurisdiction was notified by the government. “We are currently running BS programme on the campus,” she said.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah had announced upgradation of the 100-year old Government College Kali Mori Hyderabad as GCU Hyderabad on Oct 9, 2017, to mark its centennial celebrations. The act was passed a year later in 2018.

13,Two cops die as grenade goes off outside armoury in police headquarters,BDS says Russian-made grenade exploded due to mishandling; CTD rules out terrorism but raises questions,"KARACHI: A grenade explosion inside the heavily guarded Garden Police Headquarters killed two policemen and wounded as many under controversial circumstances on Wednesday.
While the police termed the incident an “accidental explosion” in which another grenade did not explode, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) raised questions as to why the grenades were kept in a police armoury and why these were taken outside the armoury.
Officials said that the grenade exploded “during inspection/cleaning” of the armoury of the South police in the Garden Police Headquarters.
South-SSP (Investigation) Dr Mohammed Imran Khan said that the grenade explosion took place when the officer in charge and his assistant were examining the armoury to assess any damage caused by torrential rains.

BDS says Russian-made grenade exploded due to mishandling; CTD rules out terrorism but raises questions

The grenade exploded outside the armoury killing Muhammed Shahzad and Sabir Husain and wounding armoury in charge Sub-Inspector Saeed and Constable Ali Gohar.
After receiving information about the incident, South-DIG Sharjeel Kharal and CTD DIG Asif Aijaz Shaikh and other officers rushed to the spot.
The bomb disposal squad and crime scene unit were also called in to collect evidence.
DIG Kharal said that the ongoing torrential rains caused damages to the police armouries in the metropolis. 
He said the officials were inspecting the armoury and when they tried to ‘defuse’ two grenades, one exploded in the hand of a policeman at around 11:15am. 
While the DIG claimed that the grenades were ‘case property’, he did not explain as to why the grenades were kept at the armoury and not at the malkhana.
He said an initial probe suggested that it was an ‘accidental’ case and not related to terrorism or sabotage.
However, the CTD and BDS teams were conducting inquiry into it. 
The DIG said as per their standard operating procedures (SOPs) the armouries were being inspected after defusing all explosive devices. 
He said that an FIR would be lodged after the report of the incident and inquiry by SP-Headquarters and City SSP who would fix responsibility.
Unanswered questions
Senior CTD official Raja Umer Khattab, who also inspected the scene, told Dawn that one of the policemen had brought the grenades from the armoury. He said one grenade exploded outside the in charge’s office and it was a miracle that the other one did not explode.
“It appeared to be a case of ‘mishandling’ rather than a terrorism incident,” he opined. 
He said it was not possible for an outsider to enter the police headquarters and carry out a terror or sabotage activity.
However, the CTD official raised several questions as to why the grenades were kept at the armoury and why the officials removed the explosive devices from there when there was no trained team for proper handling. 
He said that these questions might be addressed after a proper inquiry. 
Meanwhile, Karachi police chief Javed Odho took notice of the incident and ordered an inquiry.
In their report, BDS officials said that during their post-blast investigation, they found that the Russian-made hand grenade, RGD-1, went off due to ‘mishandling’ by police officials.
“Another hand grenade, also RGD-I, in misfire/dangerous condition was also recovered at the crime scene, which made safe at the spot by the Bomb Disposal Unit team,” the report stated.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that Shehzad Khan, 23, and Mohammad Sabir, 51, were brought dead to the Civil Hospital Karachi. The condition of the wounded policeman was said to be stable.
Meanwhile,the funeral prayers for the two policemen were held at the Garden Police Headquarters in the evening.

He said that according to a report as many as 363 drug and narcotics dens were operating in the city with active connivance of police. “The drugs are not being sold at any secret or hidden places, but in open places,” he said, asking what hindered the authorities to take action against them.
In a separate call attention notice, PTI’s Shahnawaz Jadoon said that his constituency PS-113 in Keamari district had become a breeding ground for the prevalence, sale and consumption of various kinds of drugs and gutka.
He said that drug dens were openly selling heroin and ‘ice’ in parts of his constituency such as Sultanabad, Masang Road and Machhar Colony.
The PTI member said that young boys including students of ninth and tenth classes had become drug addict. “There has been a surge in thefts and house robberies due to this menace,” he lamented.
Replying to his call attention notice, Excise Taxation and Narcotics Control Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla said that three gutka manufacturing factories had been seized while 245 people were arrested.
“It is the duty of all of us to stop the use of drugs,” he said, asking the opposition members to keep pointing out the areas where the gutka and drugs were being sold.
The excise minister assured that that the provincial government would take strict action against it.
Dilapidated roads in metropolis
Mr Memon, who also holds the portfolio of the transport department, informed the lawmakers that the provincial government had released Rs1.5 billion to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and Karachi Development Authority with a time frame for repair and rehabilitation of the roads on the route of the Peoples Bus Service in the city.
Replying to a call attention notice given by Rabia Khatoon of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, the minister said the repair work on the bus routes would start from Thursday (today). 
“Funds of billions of rupees have also been allocated for the repair of other roads in the city,” he added.
In her call attention notice, the MQM-P lawmaker asked the local government department as to what steps were being taken for the repair of the roads and streets damaged by the recent spells of the monsoon rains.
She said that the roads and streets were in a dilapidated condition across the city, which was also littered with the heaps of garbage and filth. Besides, she said, there were ponds and puddles of rainwater in the city, while the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board had miserably failed to remove garbage in every part of the metropolis.
Ms Khatoon said that 90 per cent roads in the city had been affected due to recent monsoon spell, causing severe traffic jams and other issues.
She said that the new buses of Peoples Bus Service were plying on the same roads and they might turn miserable like previous buses, if keep plying on the dilapidated roads.
“The KMC and KDA have been directed to make these roads motorable in minimum possible time,” Mr Memon said.
Meanwhile, the house also passed ‘The Sindh Textbook Board (Amendment) Bill, 2022’ and ‘The Provincial Motor Vehicles (Second Amendment) Bill, 2021’. 
The sitting was adjourned to Thursday (today) at 2pm.

18,Artificial Sensations under way,"KARACHI: It needs to be researched with a great deal of sincerity, and not just to garner fame or acquire assistance...","KARACHI: It needs to be researched with a great deal of sincerity, and not just to garner fame or acquire assistance from any kind, as to why Karachi has become such a close-to-heart topic for the creative lot. This becomes all the more interesting when one realises that the city’s documented history (repeat: documented history) goes back a touch less than 200 years. Perhaps it’s the sea which invokes so many feelings at the same time.
An exhibition of the super talented young artist Jovita Alvares’s artworks titled Artificial Sensations that can be seen at the Chawkandi Art Gallery is not entirely about the city by the sea but has it as a strong reference point.
How does one know that? Well, the beginning of a write-up by art curator Haseeb Ullah Zafar provided by Alvares as an introduction to the show reveals the following: “Within Karachi’s arid urbanscape with its mishmash of colonial era residences and an ever growing number of towering concrete grey structures, there exists a unique and oft-overlooked language of form and function; of prickly thorns and slick razor wires; of an urban metropolis and its green-thumbed residents.
“Alongside urban aspirations of security, endures a desire for floral facades to beautify and obscure these reminders of our mortality. If a home is a castle, what does it say if the walls are built unusually high, if razor wire coils overwhelm them, and if grilles bar every opening? 
“These are some of the questions that Jovita Alvares addresses through her investigations into the abundance of bougainvillea blossoms she finds dotting the bleak and rigid urban planning on her daily commutes,” it said. 
These are some of the questions indeed, but there’s more to it than meets the eye. 
By coming up with exhibits such as the ‘Obscure’ series (paper cutting and digital montage on acid free paper), the young artist is not just talking about the tangible issues of security, she is also making an intelligent comment on a significant change that has occurred within those who live in this urban setting: they allow the powers that be to pull the wool over their eyes, ignoring tender aspects of life. Tender like flowers…     
The exhibition concludes on Thursday (today).

19,Minister seeks assistance to strengthen family planning services,KARACHI: The provincial health minister at a meeting held with the representatives of Bill and Melinda Gates...,"KARACHI: The provincial health minister at a meeting held with the representatives of Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) the other day sought assistance for strengthening family planning and reproductive health services in the province. 
The meeting chaired by Health and Population Welfare Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho was attended by Dr Yasmeen Qazi, BMGF’s senior country advisor on family planning and maternal and newborn child health, Parliamentary Secretary Health Qasim Soomro, Secretary Health Zulfiqar Shah and focal person on family planning Dr Talib Lashari, among others.
During the meeting, Dr Pechuho sought assistance from BMGF for making effective communication strategy and infection prevention, urging all stakeholders to stay in regular communication to avoid any overlap in services and regions. 
Sharing developments in the sector, Dr Pechuho said there had been successful partnerships with the private sector and there had been willing distributors of contraceptives, which were provided to the private sector free of cost, and should be provided to people for free.
The minister also informed the meeting that the Reproductive Health Bill had been amended to include self-care, communication strategy for the community as well as service providers, and a registry for maternal deaths, largely blamed on delayed referrals.
She emphasised the need for focusing on preventative healthcare, which included creating awareness among adolescent girls about their reproductive rights, health, nutrition and hygiene so they could make informed decisions in the future. It also involved, she said, easy access to service providers and counselling, especially male family members.
Highlighting steps to address the high number of maternal deaths in the province, health department officials informed the meeting that birthing stations were being made available at dispensaries across Sindh, and there was a plan to set up more such dispensaries in underserved areas of the province.
Currently, 93 of these dispensaries were functioning successfully under pilot projects in five districts; Tharparkar, Sujawal, Thatta, Jamshoro and Qambar Shahdadkot.
