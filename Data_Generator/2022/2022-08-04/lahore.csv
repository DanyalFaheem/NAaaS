The protest resulted in long queues of cars and a few buses, whose owners did not join the agitation, causing problems for commuters.
Hundreds of transport owners from Bund Road and Badami Bagh bus terminals participated in the protest at the M-II interchange.  
The district administration and police were holding talks with the protesters to get the interchange cleared for the stranded commuters till the filing of this story at 10pm.
The transport owners say the government imposed Rs8,000 per seat tax on them from this year, hiking it four times from Rs200 of last year. They say the enhanced rate of tax, coupled with an increase in token tax and the exorbitant hike in diesel prices, has made it difficult for them to continue their business.  
They vowed to continue their protest till the acceptance of their demands.
The inter-city passengers, particularly those who have to visit towns not accessible by train, have to face problems due to unavailability of the public transport.
City railway station also witnessed an increased rush of passengers because of transport strike. Passengers problems were compounded as trains were already running behind their schedules because of rains and shortage of locomotives.

Although the Punjab government has given Rs800,000 to each family, they say their scars are too deep to heal. Twenty-one people including six children have died in the flash floods.

Other victims included Sameena Bibi, daughter of Bilal, Arif, 3, son of Munir Ahmad, and Bashiran Mai, daughter of Allah Wasaya, her son Imran, and Ramzan, son of Allah Divaya, who drowned while trying to rescue his uncle in Sanghar. He has left behind two wives and three children to mourn. Unfortunately, one of his brothers, Javed, also died.

The petition sought an early decision on the reference under Article 63(2), 62 and 63 of the Constitution, which had been pending before the electoral watchdog since February 2022.
Petitioner’s counsel Advocate Azhar Siddique objected to issuing notice to the attorney general for Pakistan (AG) and said they did not make the federal government a party to the case and why the attorney general was appearing in the court.
He said the ECP had delisted the case several times.
He said they also had filed a disqualification reference with the Senate chairman but he did not give any decision after a lapse of one month and they had to approach the ECP.
Mr Siddique said the ECP was not giving any decision on the disqualification of Senator Ishaq Dar and the hearing was adjourned every time.
He further claimed that the ECP’s alleged act of joining hands with the federal government not only “ruined its image” but also raised questions about its neutrality.
He said a three-member judge bench headed by ex-chief justice Saqib Nisar had declared the former finance minister a defaulter in appointment of PTV chief Attaul Haq Qasmi case.
He further stated that as per the judgment, over Rs190 million were spent in the form of salaries and perks granted to Qasmi.
Ordering that the amount spent on the former MD and chairman of PTV be returned by those involved in the illegal appointment, the bench had said, “Qasmi will pay 50 per cent of the amount, while former ministers Pervaiz Rasheed and Ishaq Dar will pay 20pc each and the former principal secretary to the premier will have to submit 10pc of the Rs190.78m”.
“Qasmi’s attitude was unacceptable and he should not be appointed to any such post in the future,” the judgment further said.
He said the Supreme Court also had ordered to recover Rs40m from Ishaq Dar in Attaul Haq Qasmi case.
He pleaded the court to direct the ECP to announce the early decision in Ishaq Dar disqualification case.
Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabbir was hearing the case. The court issued notices to ECP and attorney general and sought reply on Ishaq Dar disqualification case on next hearing.

3,Three dists to be part of new division,CM to make announcement during Gujrat visit...,"GUJRAT: At least three districts of Gujranwala division are likely to be included in the proposed new administrative division of Gujrat since it (Gujranwala) has been the largest division of Punjab with six districts. Most of the divisions in Punjab comprise four districts.
The Punjab Board of Revenue through its senior member revenue has already sought a detailed report from the Gujranwala Commissioner Mansoor Qadir and Gujrat Deputy Commissioner Amer Shahzad Kang by engaging land revenue and other departments concerned.
A senior official told Dawn here on Wednesday that as per the proposal the districts of Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad would be included in the new administrative division after bifurcation of the existing Gujranwala division whereas Wazirabad tehsil of Gujranwala district might also be upgraded as a new district to make it a part of Gujrat division -- may be now or at a later stage.

CM to make announcement during Gujrat visit

Moreover, he said that work was also underway to prepare a proposal for the creation of at least two new tehsils by bifurcating the Gujrat tehsil as Jalalpur Jattan and Kunjah tehsils. Nevertheless, chances of tehsil status for Jalalpur Jattan town are bright as the homework for the creation of this tehsil has basically been done in 2017 but it was delayed due to the start of delimitation of constituencies.
Sources said Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi would announce the creation of Gujrat division during his first visit to his hometown after becoming CM and efforts were being made to complete required process in this regard within a week or so.
In fact, the process for the creation of Gujrat division had started in 2021 when senior PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi approached then Punjab chief minister Usman Buzdar who accepted the proposal.  
With 16.3 million population, Gujranwala division faces a huge workload in administrative offices. 
In case of creation of Gujrat division, the districts of Gujranwala, Sialkot and Narowal will remain intact in the existing Gujranwala division.

The courses include drawing, painting, calligraphy, performing arts (acting/drama), fresco painting, Indo-Persian miniature painting, sculpture, write shoot edit (short film), fashion illustration, animation, graphic design, digital photography, pop singing and guitar to be offered by experts of each field/area. These courses are designed to be offered at a very nominal fee so those, who suffer from financial constraints, can have access to art and design education.
The programme inspires people from diverse backgrounds to make art and design a part of their lives.
The community outreach programme provides students, teachers and communities with undeviating hands-on arts experiences through personal interaction with artists and lecturers.

The ECP on Tuesday ruled that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) received millions of dollars of funds from 351 foreign companies and 34 foreign nationals and ordered a show cause notice to the party seeking an explanation as to why the prohibited funds it received should not be forfeited.
“Imran Khan will go home for receiving money from the prohibited funds. Khan received $5.1million from 265 companies and he can not save himself from disqualification,” Ms Bokhari told a press conference here on Wednesday.
She said the PML-N had no objection if the ECP carried out the security of its funds on the pattern of the PTI. She said Imran had been proved a “certified thief and lair” and now after the ECP’s verdict, the Supreme Court’s stamp was left to declare him so.
She alleged that Khan collected money in the name of her mother, Shaukat Khanum. She said Khan would now reap what had sown.
She said Imran Khan was calling the federal government ‘imported’ but the fact was that his funds, children and friends all were imported.

Mr Iqbal had challenged the establishment of an inquiry commission to probe into harassment allegations leveled against him by a woman, Tayyaba Gull, in the LHC three days ago.
Mr Iqbal had filed a petition with the court and made the federal government a party to it.
Ms Gull had lodged a harassment case with an accountability court in Lahore and also before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in the National Assembly.

The PTI had won 15 out of 20 general seats in the by-elections and succeeded in having Parvez Elahi as Punjab chief minister in the second election for the top slot in the province.  
Chohan had filed a bail application in a case registered under sections 324, 353, 186, 506-B, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 at the Chuhng police station on Aug 1 last for attacking a raiding team.

13,Valmikis converge on Lahore temple ‘after 20 years’,"The temple is said to be around 1,200 years old.","LAHORE: The recently re-acquired historic Valmiki temple in the Neela Gumbad area here was formally inaugurated on Wednesday at an event organised under the auspices of the Pakistan Hindu Mandir Management Committee (PHMMC) and the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB).
The event was attended by over 100 Valmiki Hindus from across the country, as well as various Sikh, Christian and Muslim leaders. The Hindu participants held apuja, distributed langar among the participants and presented specialsaropay (a scarf presented in Sikhism to felicitate and honour someone) and gifts to the guests.
The temple is said to be around 1,200 years old and possessed by a converted Hindu family that, claiming to be the property owner, filed a case in the civil court in 2010-2011. In the first week of July, the court admitted the ETPB was the sole owner of the property after which the board retrieved its possession.
The PHMMC members surveyed the renovation and construction work and appreciated the ETPB’s efforts for the purpose, said Mr Amir Hashmi, the ETPB spokesman.
Additional Secretary (Shrines) Rana Shahid was the chief guest at the event, which was also attended by ETPB Deputy Secretary Faraz Abbas and other officials as well as PHMMC President Krishan Sharma, General Secretary Diwan Chand Chawla and committee member Amarnath Randhawa and others from across the country. Christian community leader Jacqueline Tressler and Minhajul Quran’s Sohail Rana were also present on the occasion.
Earlier, a meeting of the temple management committee was held under the chairmanship of ETPB Chairman Habibur Rehman Gilani at the board’s office, where all the members through a unanimous resolution lauded the ETPB chairman and the shrines administration, courts and judges for retrieving possession of the historic Valmiki temple and initiating renovation and other administrative measures. They said they had got the opportunity to come here and pray after 20 years.
Mr Gilani assured the committee members of protecting Hindu temples and taking appropriate measures for the welfare of the Hindu community. In light of the directions of the federal government, the ETPB is making utmost efforts to protect, rehabilitate and renovate religious sites of Hindus and Sikhs.
Talking to Dawn, PHMMC President Sharma said it was a goodwill gesture and also a step towards mainstreaming the community and should be applauded. “As a Pakistani Hindu, two things that Hindus and the insulated community fear here: freedom of faith or belief regarding which there were questions socially, politically, administratively, and secondly social protection. In India mosques are getting deserted, people are being harassed, whether they are Dalits or Hindus. While in a country created in the name of Islam, temples are reopening every other day.”
The Valmiki sect of Hindus are a poor segment of society who have no say or access, Mr Sharma explained, adding they had regained access to this temple now. “The role of Valmikis is very significant in Hindu mythology; had they not written the Ramayan, no one would know Ram. Earlier, this temple was not being used for worshipping, those possessing it didn’t allow anyone to enter. But now, every Hindu can come in and pray,” he added. 
Mr Sharma further said the historic Prahlad temple in Multan that was destroyed in the early 90s after the Babri Mosque incident was being rehabilitated and renovated; it is crucial to the Hindu festival of Holi. “We’re making efforts to promote religious tourism and rehabilitate many other temples and religious sites across the country. There are issues everywhere in the world, which are exploited by inimical forces in the region. So, such steps could silence them and counter their narrative.”

The city sewerage system has choked owing to encroachments and illegal buildings.  
A team of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) visited Muzaffargarh  three times in the last four years and expressed their desire to build a new sewerage system but they did not follow up on it.  
A source said the ADB officials came here only for photo sessions.  
The worst-hit areas of city are Qayyumnagar, Jhang Mor, Bukhariwala, Mithuwala, Zaffar Colony, Purani Chungi and Yadgar Colony.
