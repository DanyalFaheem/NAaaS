• Demonstrators free to hold protest at F-9 park or Parade Ground
ISLAMABAD: Fearing that Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) ‘miscreants’ may attack the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday (today) during protests outside its offices announced by party chief Imran Khan, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah declared on Wednesday the government would not allow any protester to enter the Red Zone.
Speaking at a press conference with Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Mr Sanaullah claimed the government had received information that the PTI plans to create an anarchic situation outside the ECP, warning of stern action in case of any violence or attempt to cross the red line.
“The PTI wants to spread chaos in the name of protest,” the minister said, claiming the coalition government has “received reports” and learned about statements of PTI chief Mr Khan and senior leader Fawad Chaudhry regarding their plans of creating an anarchic situation.
The warning came a day ahead of the PTI’s planned protests outside the ECP offices in Islamabad, Lahore and Peshawar announced by PTI senior leader Asad Umer in a tweet.
A day before the ECP’s announcement of its reserved judgement in the PTI prohibited funding case, party chairman Imran Khan had also called on his supporters to rally outside the electoral body’s headquarters to demand Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja’s resignation.
The interior minister said the demonstrators were free to hold a protest at the nearby F-9 park or the Parade Ground, where he assured them they will be fully facilitated. “Staging a peaceful protest is the right of every political party,” he remarked. He further said the PTI had announced a protest soon after going through the ECP judgement.
Referring to the party’s ‘Azadi March’ back in May, Mr Sanaullah alleged it had brought along armed activists and ministers in the protest. “If this time they undertake any adventure, they will be tackled with force,” he warned.
He said the ECP’s verdict had proved that Imran Khan was a “foreign agent” and PTI a “foreign-aided political party”.
“He took money to pollute Pakistan’s politics and infused it with hatred,” he alleged, adding the ECP verdict had identified some criminal activities by the PTI, including money laundering, fake accounts and forgery. “The ECP has drawn conclusions on the basis of concrete material evidence.”  
The minister said the federal cabinet will take important decisions on Thursday (today), including considering whether to declare PTI a foreign-aided party and filing a reference against it with the Supreme Court, while the Federal Investigation Agency will proceed on the criminal side. He ruled out proceeding against four PTI paid employees who received party funds in their personal accounts, saying these poor people had only been used.
Answering a question, the PML-N leader said under the law, any political party that received funds from a foreign government, company or individual was a foreign-aided party.
Asked if Imran Khan’s name was being placed on the Exit Control List, he said nothing would be rushed through and requisite time would be taken to decide. He also said PTI leaders tried to “build a narrative” that the ECP decision was in their favour.
“Fawad Chaudhry is trying to manoeuvre a point that there is no mention of foreign funds. But the verdict shows that [PTI] is foreign-aided. Now there is no room for them to get out of this.”
The minister added the government would fulfil its legal responsibilities and not on the basis of personal grudges. However, the PML-N remained a victim of witch-hunt throughout the PTI’s days in power, he commented.

3,ECP verdict has exposed PTI’s ‘clean party’ narrative: JI chief Siraj,"Says his party has already made it clear that PTI, PML-N and PPP are sides of the same coin","QUETTA: Jamaat-i-Islami emir Sirajul Haq on Wednesday said the ECP verdict had exposed the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s so-called “clean party” narrative. 
Speaking at the Quetta Press Club’s programme ‘Meet the Press’, he said his party had already made it clear that the PTI, PML-N and PPP were sides of the same coin. He said it was beyond understanding why the verdict in the foreign funding case was delayed for eight years. Had the verdict been announced before 2018, the PTI would have stayed out of power, he said. 
“The point I understand is that political parties are not held accountable while in power,” the JI chief said. 
He expressed grief over martyrdom of army officers and jawans in a helicopter crash in Balochistan and termed it a national tragedy. He also expressed grief over the loss of human lives and property in flood-hit areas of the country and appealed to the people to donate generously in relief activities launched by JI volunteers and Al-Khidmat Foundation. 
He rejected the government’s decision to put on sale national institutions and entities and announced that his party would challenge the privatisation law in court. The government, he said, was bent upon selling national assets at throwaway prices on IMF’s pressure. 
Instead of handing over national assets to foreign companies and private individuals, the rulers must bring back their own wealth from their overseas companies and foreign banks in the best interest of the nation, he said. 
Mr Haq said decisions about the fate of the country were being made behind closed-doors and ruling parties had destroyed the economy and virtually handed it over to global lenders. 
The JI leader said the rulers were still engaged in power politics, abandoning even the people marooned by the devastated floods across the country.
