The AFC on Monday announced a new format for joint-qualification to the two tournaments, which will allow teams like Pakistan — who have fallen at the initial stage on each of the last two occasions since qualifying for both the World Cup and the Asian Cup was merged — to stay in the running for a spot at the Asian Cup if they lose the first home-and-away tie. 
“The AFC’s Vision underlines our desire to ensure the success of our teams through world-class competitions and the new qualification format has been specifically designed to achieve those ambitions,” AFC general secretary Datuk Seri Windsor John told Dawn in a statement on Wednesday. 
“As we have seen in the recently concluded campaign, the AFC Asian Qualifiers — Road to Qatar [2022] broke all digital engagement records, and we are confident that the new qualification format will continue to inspire our participating teams to scale even greater heights and excite and enthuse passionate fans of Asian football like never before.” 
Pakistan will hope its football team seeks inspiration from the new format. 
The national team hasn’t won a World Cup qualifier in its history and having fallen to Syria and Cambodia in the first round of qualifying for the 2018 and 2022 editions respectively, it has faced eight years without much competitive action. 
Add to that to the institutional crisis in the Pakistan Football Federation, which has resulted in Pakistan being suspended twice by FIFA — the latest 14-month ban only being lifted in June this year, players haven’t played much either internationally or domestically. 
It means that with the Asian qualifying cycle for the expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup in the United States. Mexico and Canada starting from October next year, Pakistan — currently 196th in the FIFA rankings — will likely be among the continent’s bottom 22 teams which will start in the first stage. 
PAKISTAN LOOK TO IMPROVE RANKING 
The groundwork to ensure Pakistan end their dismal record World Cup qualifying record will be done by the FIFA-appointed PFF Normalisation Committee and its recently-appointed coaching consultant Shahzad Anwar said the first aim was to advance from the first stage. 
“That will not only see us go directly into the group stage of the Asian Cup qualifying but also give us the opportunity to compete against Asia’s top teams in the second round of World Cup qualifying,” Shahzad told Dawn on Wednesday.  
“There is a second chance to play in the Asian Cup qualifying playoffs if there is a first-stage loss but right now, the focus is to win the first stage.” 
Shahzad believes the key to crossing the first hurdle is to improving the team’s ranking. 
“We will try to be amongst the seeded teams in the first round by being at least among top 10 in the bottom 22,” he said. “That will help us get an easier draw. In order to improve the ranking, we will try to arrange as many friendly matches during the international weeks.” 
Getting past the first round still remains a tall order for Pakistan. 
The PFF crisis has meant the domestic league hasn’t been held regularly. The uncertainty whether the departmental sports system will be revived has also meant that the Pakistan Premier Football League cannot be planned. 
PFF NC member Shahid Khokhar, however, said on Wednesday that other aspects to rebuild the national team are also under consideration. 
“We are looking to gather a player pool which will have both established and emerging players,” Shahid told Dawn. “We can then work on them for the next 14 months to work on their fitness and game temperament.  
“We are also looking at forming a panel of coaches for the team. It’s a tough road for us but we’re hoping to do our best.”

1,Yadav blitz restores series lead for India,BASSETERRE: Suryakumar Yadav epitomised his team’s new all-out attacking approach with a blazing 76 at the top of...,"BASSETERRE: Suryakumar Yadav epitomised his team’s new all-out attacking approach with a blazing 76 at the top of the order as India romped to a seven-wicket victory over the West Indies in the third T20 International in St Kitts on Tuesday.
After his Caribbean counterpart, Kyle Mayers, anchored the home side’s total of 164 for five with a boisterous 73 off 50 balls batting first, Yadav’s effort off 44 deliveries with eight fours and four sixes ensured the visitors cantered to the target with an over to spare to take a 2-1 lead in the series ahead of the final two matches at the weekend in Florida.
Beaten in the final over of the second match a day earlier when their batting failed to fire consistently, India looked focused and purposeful from the start of their innings with the only concern being over the fitness of the captain.
Rohit Sharma was forced to retire in the second over after it appeared that he hurt his lower back attempting a violent swing to the on-side.
However Yadav, given free reign to play his shots from ball one, then dominated an 86-run stand with Shreyas Iyer (24) which effectively ended the match as a contest.
An unbeaten 33 from Rishabh Pant then formalised the win.
“When Rohit went inside it was important for someone to bat through to the 17th over but I was still able to be myself and express myself,” said Yadav.
“I really loved it because I have done it in the IPL (Indian Premier League) as well. I just backed myself and enjoyed it.” Sharma subsequently indicated that the injury was not as serious as it first looked and he expects to be fit for the last two matches.
West Indies’ quest to challenge the Indian batting line-up hinged on Mayers’ aggression at the start of the match with the left-hander, belting eight fours and four sixes before becoming the second wicket for Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the 17th over.
However no-one else in the batting order managed any meaningful contribution as Indian bowlers picked up wickets at important stages to thwart the home side’s best effort at posting a formidable total.
“We had to get early wickets but it didn’t happen,” explained West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran.  “I was still happy with our total though and felt we were in the game at the halfway stage.”

The system, which uses special cameras that will track body points on players, will be used for the Super Cup in Helsinki and then from the Champions League group stage.
“UEFA is constantly looking for new technological solutions to improve the game and support the work of the referees,” UEFA Chief Refereeing Officer Roberto Rosetti said in a statement.
“This innovative system will allow Video Assistant Referee (VAR) teams to determine offside situations quickly and more accurately, enhancing the flow of the game and the consistency of the decisions.”  UEFA said the new system will operate with special cameras that track 29 different body points per player, with a total of 188 tests performed since 2020, including all games from last season’s Champions League, the knockout stage of the Women’s Champions League and the women’s Euros.
“The system is ready to be used in official matches and implemented at each Champions League venue,” Rosetti said.
The Super Cup game takes place on Aug 10, with English referee Michael Oliver appo­inted as the on-field official.
FIFA said last month that SAOT would be used at this year’s World Cup in Qatar, promising decisions that are more accurate and a lot quicker.
Using cameras strategically positioned around the stadiums, and a chip in the match ball, FIFA said the technology will go a long way to cutting down on VAR decisions on marginal offside calls and reduce the time needed to check.
Spectators will also be able to see some of the 3D animation when VAR decisions are explained on a stadium’s screen.

3,Premier League clubs to stop taking knee before every match,LONDON: English Premier League football players said Wednesday they will no longer take the knee before every match...,"LONDON: English Premier League football players said Wednesday they will no longer take the knee before every match in the upcoming season, following criticism that the anti-racism gesture was losing its impact.
In a Premier League statement, club captains said that instead, they would bend before selected games,  “and in so doing we continue to show solidarity for a common cause”.
The league said it supported the captains’ decision, and would elevate anti-racism messaging as part of its  “No Room for Racism” campaign — words that already feature on players’ sleeves.
Premier League players began taking the knee at the start of every game in June 2020, when the season resumed following a Covid shutdown, a month after the killing in the United States of George Floyd.
Ex-NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling to protest against racial injustice in 2016, and the gesture has become a familiar sight across a range of sports since Floyd’s murder by a US police officer.
But several Premier League players queried its continuing relevance — and some right-wing politicians in Britain have criticised its identification with the Black Lives Matter protest movement.
Wilfried Zaha, a black striker for Crystal Palace, was an early dissident, labelling the gesture  “degrading” and opting to stand instead.
Last season, Chelsea’s white defender Marcos Alonso decided to stand and point instead to the anti-racism badge on his shirt sleeve.
Alonso’s then team-mate Romelu Lukaku said football had to take  “stronger” action in the fight against racism, with abuse still rife against black footballers on social media.
“Yeah, we are taking the knee... but sometimes after the game, you see another insult,” Lukaku told CNN Sport in September last year.
Rather than every match, Premier League players now intend to take the knee at this weekend’s opening round of the season, and before dedicated  “No Room for Racism” match rounds in October and March.
The captains said they will also observe it before Boxing Day fixtures, on the final day of the season, and before the FA Cup and League Cup finals.
“We remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice, and to bring about an inclusive society with respect and equal opportunities for all,” they said in the statement.
Sales of  “No Room For Racism” sleeve badges on replica shirts last season raised 119,000 ($145,000) in royalties for the clubs.
They are donating that sum to designated youth teams, with the Premier League matching the amount, according to the statement.

French-born Maltese International Teddy Teuma gave the Belgians the lead just before the half-hour mark, and Union Saint-Gilloise got a potentially crucial second goal in controversial fashion with 14 minutes left.
Connor Goldson was penalised for a handball in the area following a VAR review and Dante Vanzeir stepped up to score the resulting penalty.
It is a remarkable result for the Brussels club, who returned to the Belgian top flight last season after an absence of almost half a century and promptly finished second under the ownership of English entrepreneur Tony Bloom.
Unable to host Rangers in their own stadium, the match was played in the nearby city of Leuven, but that did not prove a handicap for Union.
Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s Rangers now face an uphill struggle in the return leg next Tuesday.
“It is very disappointing, especially when our performance was not at the level we normally are and the level you need to compete at this level,” Van Bronckhorst told the BBC.
Of the penalty, he added:  “You are playing in the biggest competition in Europe, with so much at stake, and to give a penalty like this is very hard.” Last season’s beaten Europa League finalists, Rangers are looking to return to the Champions League group stage for the first time in over a decade.
The winners of the third qualifying round tie will go on to a play-off later this month against either Monaco or PSV Eindhoven, with the winners of that advancing to the group stage.
Monaco needed a late equaliser from centre-back Axel Disasi to draw 1-1 with Ruud van Nistelrooy’s PSV at the Stade Louis II on Tuesday.
Disasi prodded home from close range when an Ismail Jakobs free-kick fell to him in the penalty area 10 minutes from time.
That cancelled out Joey Veerman’s first-half opener for PSV and ensured the tie is finely poised ahead of next week’s return leg in the Netherlands.
Monaco missed out on direct qualification for the group stage when they conceded a stoppage-time goal on the final day of the last Ligue 1 season and dropped from second to third in the table as a result, behind Marseille.
Benfica, who reached the quarter-finals last season before losing to Liverpool, crushed Midtjylland of Denmark 4-1 in Lisbon with Goncalo Ramos scoring a hat-trick.
Enzo Fernandez also scored for the Portuguese side with Pione Sisto netting a late consolation from the penalty spot.
Earlier there were 2-1 away wins for Viktoria Plzen of the Czech Republic, and Croatia’s Dinamo Zagreb, against Sheriff Tiraspol of Moldova and Ludogorets of Bulgaria respectively.

The 27-year-old Australian fired 12 aces and saved the lone break point he faced to oust Giron in 59 minutes for a triumphant return at the US Open hardcourt tune-up.
After a 3-3 start, Kyrgios won nine of the last 11 games for the victory despite memories of a poor effort in a first-round exit last year during  “a dark time in my life.”
“I just really wanted to force myself to have high energy and pull out a performance,” Kyrgios said.  “My confidence was a bit low coming out just because being on that court again. I got disgraced last year first round, and it was tough to stomach.
“I’m proud of my performance today. It wasn’t easy.” World number 63 Kyrgios, whose most recent title came at Washington in 2019, booked a second-round match against US 14th seed Tommy Paul.
Kyrgios said he has struggled to move on after his Wimbledon final loss to Novak Djokovic last month.
“It was hard. I feel like a Grand Slam final doesn’t come around so often for us normal players. That was like the golden opportunity.
“I’m doing all the right things to put myself in that position again. I don’t think we thought it was possible to contend for Grand Slams, but now it’s a genuine thing.” A hearing in Australia on common assault charges against Kyrgios from a January 2021 incident had originally been scheduled for Tuesday but last month was moved to Aug 23, six days before the start of the US Open.
“I’ve got people in my corner and my team dealing with those things. They are out of my control,” Kyrgios said.  “All I can do is just continue to work and keep my head down and do what I love to do every day.” Top seed Andrey Rublev advanced to the third round by defeating Britain’s Jack Draper 6-4, 6-2.
World number eight Rublev dispatched the 81st-ranked English left-hander in 83 minutes without surrendering a break.
Rublev will play for a quarter-final berth Thursday against an American, either Jack Sock or Maxime Cressy.
Rublev, 24, seeks his fourth ATP title of the year and the 12th of his career after crowns at Marseille and Dubai in February and Belgrade in April.
Rublev, who wrote  “No War Please” on a camera lens at Dubai, was among Russian players banned from Wimbledon because of his homeland’s military invasion of Ukraine.
Reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu, the 19-year-old British second seed, reached the second round by defeating American Louisa Chirico 6-4, 6-2.
World number 10 Raducanu won her first match since a second-round Wimbledon exit to book a last-16 match against Colombia’s Mara Camila Osorio.
Former world number one Victoria Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion and three-time US Open runner-up, beat Ukraine’s Dayana Yastremska 6-4, 6-0.
American Mackenzie McDonald, the 2021 Washington runner-up, lost his opener 1-6, 6-4, 6-4 to Finland’s Emil Ruusuvuori, who meets Polish second seed Hubert Hurkacz next.

Right-arm pacer Naseem Shah replaced experienced campaigner Hasan while Salman Ali Agha, who played in the recently-held two-Test series in Sri Lanka, was also recalled for the series against the Netherlands, as the national selection committee announced the two teams in a press release, again avoiding a press conference, despite instructions from PCB chairman Ramiz Raja in this regard.
At his last press conference held in Lahore, Ramiz to a question had instructed the PCB media department to arrange a news conference for announcing the national side.
The 22-year-old Shaheen after suffering a knee injury during the first Test which the tourists won against Sri Lanka in Galle last month, missed the second Test at the same venue where the hosts thrashed Pakistan by 246 runs to square the series. Rather than resting the lanky left-armer who will be required for the all-important T20 World Cup scheduled for October-November in Australia, the selectors in a surprising move decided to retain him in the ODI as well as T20 squad while the trainer will continue the player’s rehab during the Netherlands tour starting with the first ODI of the three-game series in Rotterdam on Aug 16. These ODIs are part of the ICC Men’s World Cup Super League.
“Shaheen Shah Afridi has been retained in the ODI and T20I squads, and his rehabilitation programme will be overseen by the team trainer and physiotherapist, who will also decide on his return to international cricket,” a PCB press release stated on Wednesday.
The 28-year-old Hasan, who has been struggling to regain form for several months amid back pain due to which he missed a number of matches in the recent past, was finally shown the door by the selectors.
“Fast bowler Naseem Shah has been named in both the squads in place of Hasan Ali, while Salman Ali Agha, who toured England in 2021 for the ODIs, has been recalled,” added the PCB statement.
According to the PCB, the series against the Netherlands will be staged from Aug 16 to 21 in Rotterdam followed by the ACC T20 Asia Cup being held from Aug 27 to Sept 11.
“There will be five changes from the Netherlands ODI squad to the T20 Asia Cup side. Abdullah Shafique, Imam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Haris, Salman Ali Agha and Zahid Mehmood will be replaced by Asif Ali, Haider Ali, Iftikhar Ahmed and Usman Qadir,” read the PCB statement.
Meanwhile, chief selector Mohammad Wasim justified the changes made to the squad.
“We have only made changes that were necessary. Both the competitions [ODI series in the Netherlands and the T20 Asia Cup] are important for us and, as such, we have picked our best available players in consultation with the captain and head coach,” Wasim said in a statement.
“Hasan has been given a break from international cricket and he has been replaced by Naseem Shah. He is express fast and can give further impetus to the fast bowling department, which already boasts Haris Rauf, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Shahnawaz Dahani.
“Naseem has not played any international white-ball cricket, but he has demonstrated with the red-ball that he is an attacking option with good pace and controlled swing.
“Salman Ali Agha has been recalled to the ODI side after he performed well in the past two Pakistan Cup tournaments, averaging 40.33 and 48.8, respectively. He also gives Babar Azam an additional bowling option.”
A strong 14-member supporting staff will accompany the players to the Netherlands and the UAE.
A training camp for the selected team will be held in Lahore from Aug 6 to 11 during which they will play two 50-over-a-side warm-up matches. The national squad leaves for Amsterdam in the wee hours of Aug 12. The T20 players will join the national squad in Dubai for the Asia Cup on Aug 22.
Squads:
For Netherlands ODIs: Babar Azam (captain), Shadab Khan (vice-captain), Abdullah Shafique, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Imam-ul-Haq, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Naseem Shah, Salman Ali Agha, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shahnawaz Dahani, Zahid Mehmood
For T20 Asia Cup: Babar (captain), Shadab (vice-captain), Asif Ali, Fakhar, Haider Ali, Haris, Iftikhar Ahmed, Khushdil, Nawaz, Rizwan, Wasim Jr, Naseem, Shaheen, Dahani, Usman Qadir

McKeon pulled one ahead of shooters Michael Gault and Phil Adams and fellow swim star Chad le Clos, who has endured a nightmare Games in Birmingham.
The 30-year-old South African had looked set to take the record himself when he came to Birmingham but so far he has just a silver medal to show for his efforts.
On another dramatic night of action in the pool, Adam Peaty showed the mentality that has brought him three Olympic titles.
The 27-year-old Englishman admitted to being at the  “bottom of the bottom” after his shock defeat in the 100m but bounced back on Tuesday to take gold in the 50m.
“I had two options this morning I either fight or don’t fight,” he told the BBC.  “Everyone who knows me, knows I fight.”
Prince William, his wife Kate and their seven-year-old daughter Charlotte attended the morning session of the swimming events.
The evening again belonged to dominant Australia, who have now won 22 golds at the Sandwell Aquatics Centre out of a total of 43 on offer.
Uganda’s Jacob Kiplimo made light of the absence of two-time world 10,000m champion Joseph Cheptegei by destroying his compatriot’s Commonwealth Games record at the Alexander Stadium.
Kiplimo, who took bronze at the recent world championships, celebrated with a dance on crossing the line after finishing in 27min 09.19sec, ahead of Kenyan pair Daniel Ebenyo and Kibiwott Kandie.
“I think for me for winning this Commonwealth Games title was everything, the most important thing for me this season,” said the 21-year-old Olympic bronze medallist.
“But I still have a lot of things to do in the future at the Olympics and world championships.”
There were golds too for Australia’s Nina Kennedy, who built on her bronze in the world championships to take the pole vault title with a best of 4.60 metres, and Chioma Onyekwere of Nigeria in the discus (61.70m).
England’s Jake Jarman claimed a fourth gold medal on the final day of gymnastics while compatriot Joe Fraser grabbed his third with victory in the parallel bars.
“I’m going to find somewhere in my house to store them [the medals] — maybe a glass cabinet or something like that, if there’s space,” said the 20-year-old Jarman.
On another stellar day for the home nation, Alice Kinsella won the women’s floor while Australia’s Kate McDonald won gold in the women’s balance beam.
Cypriot Ilias Georgiou won the men’s horizontal bar.
England finished with 10 gold medals out of a total of 14 in the artistic gymnastics.
In the more genteel world of lawn bowls, India triumphed in the women’s fours final, beating 2018 silver medallists South Africa 17-10, while Wales beat England in the men’s pairs final.
“We woke up with the mindset that this is a new day, a new beginning, and that we have the opportunity to do something very special,” said India’s Rupa Rani Tirkey. “We are glad we been able to achieve that.”

10,Pakistan end CWG campaign with third straight loss,Fall to a 44-run defeat against Australia at Edgbaston.,"BIRMINGHAM: A third straight loss ended a dismal campaign for the Pakistan cricket team in the women’s Twenty20 competition at the Commonwealth Games on Wednesday. 
Having lost to Barbados and arch-rivals India in their opening two Group ‘A’ games, Pakistan fell to a 44-run defeat against Australia at Edgbaston to wrap up their participation in the sport’s Games debut. 
Unbeaten half-centuries by Beth Mooney and Tahlia McGrath powered Australia to 160-2 and Pakistan could only make 116-8 in their reply. 
Australia, who will face either New Zealand or England in the semi-finals on Friday, elected to bat after winning the toss but were soon in a spot of bother as they were reduced to 19-2 after Alyssa Healy (four) and Meg Lanning (four) fell cheaply. 
Healy was dropped at slip on the fourth ball of the game but could not capitalise on the life, as an in-swinging delivery from Fatima Sana caught her inside edge and rocketed into leg stump an over later. 
Pakistan were celebrating again when left-arm spinner Sadia Iqbal’s delivery spun past Australian skipper Lanning’s bat and hit the top of her off-stump. 
That, however, was as good as it got for Pakistan as McGrath (78 not out) and Mooney (70) pulverised the bowling to help Australia to a strong total. 
Pakistan lost their first two wickets inside two overs and couldn’t recover. 
Megan Schutt had Muneeba Ali Siddiqui (duck) caught at backward point with her third delivery, before Iram Javed (six) skied a shorter delivery from Darcie Brown nine balls later. 
Pakistan captain Bismah Maroof and Omaima Sohail tried to resurrect the innings with a promising partnership, but it did not last long. 
Omaima was cleaned up by Alana King and Aliya Riaz was dismissed soon after, running herself out after a misjudged second run. 
Bismah held the innings together for a while, but once she was dismissed by McGrath, getting to the three-figure mark itself appeared challenging for Pakistan.

Fatima Sana provided some fireworks in a late cameo of 35 off 26 but the target proved well beyond Pakistan. 
HANZALA FALTERS 
In action elsewhere at the Games on Wednesday, Pakistan enjoyed victories in badminton and squash but there were defeats in judo while weightlifter Hanzala Dastagir Butt was left in tears. 
In the 109kg weightlifting final at the NEC Hall, Hanzala started off with a lift of 135kg in the scratch and went on to improve it with a best attempt of 142kg.  
Ninth among 10 competitors at the halfway stage, Hanzala couldn’t improve further. He lifted 173kg in his first attempt at clean and jerk but failed in his subsequent attempts at 180kg with tears filling up his eyes as he left the arena with a combined lift of 315kg. 
Junior Periclex Ngadja Nyabeyeu of Cameroon won gold in the event with a combined lift of 361kg, edging Samoa’s Jack Hitila Opeloge by just three kilogrammes. India’s Lovepreet Singh clinched bronze with a total of 355kg. 
SHUTTLERS ADVANCE 
Pakistan had a good day in the badminton court with Irfan Saeed Bhatti and Ghazala Siddique progressing to the second rounds of their respective categories. 
Irfan reached the men’s singles round of 32 after overwhelming Zambia’s Chongo Mulenga 21-6, 21-19 in 32 minutes while Ghazala Siddique booked her berth in the women’s singles round of 32 after cruising past Falklands’ Vicky Chater 21-4, 21-3. 
Ghazala teamed up with compatriot Mahoor Shahzad for the women’s doubles event but they were overpowered Australians Gronya Somerville and Hsuan –Yu Wendy Chen 21-10, 21-13. 
DOUBLES WIN 
Pakistan, however, did savour a doubles win on Tuesday — in squash. 
Nasir Iqbal and Faiza 
Zafar reached the mixed doubles round-of-16 after overcoming Sri Lankans Sinaly Chanithma and Wakeel Shamil 11-10, 11-5. 
The country’s other mixed doubles team of Amna Fayyaz and Tayyab Aslam, however, fell to a 11-6, 11-6 defeat against Meagan Best and Cumberbatch Khamal of Barbados. 
In the pool, Pakistan’s Jahanara Nabi finished third in her heat of the women’s 400m freestyle in a time of 4:36.87 but couldn’t advance to the semi-finals.

In a letter written to retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar as chairman of the four-member committee on Aug 3, the instructions read, “Furthermore, a summary to the Prime Minister/Patron-in-Chief PHF has been submitted by the Ministry of Inter-provincial Coordination (IPC) regarding PHF affairs. Therefore, till response from the PM Office, the elections may be withheld.”
Interestingly, so far Brig Khokhar has not accepted the four-member committee as he is working as PHF president.
Moreover, when the PSB formed the said committee on July 21 Brig Khokhar was mentioned as a member of the committee. However, in the letter issued on Aug 3, he was addressed as the chairman of the committee.
In a recent interview with Dawn, Brig Khokhar had vowed that he would only follow the PHF constitution that empowers him to hold fresh elections. But if he accepts the PSB-appointed committee, it would be against the PHF constitution as the body was formed to hold the elections within the next 30 days.
On Saturday, PHF’s media department issued a press release announcing the schedule of the elections to be held from Aug 5 to 19 from club to national level. It was announced by Nasir, one of the members of the four-member committee, without the consent of the other three members — Khalid, Rehan Butt and Arshad.
According to the latest PSB letter, “It has been learnt that an elective meeting of PHF office-bearers has been convened on Aug 5, 2022 in Lahore. It is worth mentioning here that the representative of the PSB was also part of the said committee. However, he was not taken on board while calling such a meeting. Moreover, no legal and constitutional formalities were fulfilled such as no election schedule was announced, no voter list was conveyed for inviting objections, if any, no schedule/deadline for submission of nomination papers of the office bearers to contest the elections of the PHF was circulated.
“Holding elections of the PHF by ignoring the lawful modus operandi shall have no legal sanctity in the eyes of law and shall lead to initiation of legal proceedings by different factions of hockey, ultimately culminating at having an adverse effect on Pakistan Hockey,” the letter added.
It may be mentioned here that PSB’s interference in the PHF affairs could persuade the International Hockey Federation (FIH) to take action against Pakistan including suspending its membership, as the FIFA had done in the case of the Pakistan Football Federation and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in the case of the POA.
