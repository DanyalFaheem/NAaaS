0,Gold outplays all other assets in 2022,Naya Pakistan Certificates and US currency offer second and third best returns; PSX investors remain losers.,"KARACHI: Gold outperformed all major invest­ment avenues by a significant margin in 2022, a research note issued by Topline Securities showed on Tuesday.
It was followed by one-year (dollar-based) Naya Pakistan Certificates and the US currency as the best-performing assets in the outgoing year.
These three asset classes provided returns that were higher than the estimated average inflation of around 20 per cent in 2022.

 





 
Gold posted a gain of 41pc as its rate rose from Rs108,200 per 10 grams to Rs152,700. Its rate increased 11pc in 2021.
In the local bullion market, gold has rallied in line with the rising dollar rate in the black market. Currently, the precious metal is mainly valued at the black market parity rather than the official rate, which is 10pc lower, it said. In contrast, gold remained “more or less stable” in 2022 in the international 
market.

Naya Pakistan Certificates and US currency offer second- and third-best returns; PSX investors remain losers

Investors holding dollar-based Naya Pakistan Certi­ficates — a scheme under the Roshan Digital         Acc­ounts (RDAs) — also made a gain of 36pc in rupee terms. That was mainly because of a falling value of the national currency.
Similarly, people who held onto dollar bills registered a gain of 28pc in 2022. The official bank rate of the dollar rose from 177 at the end of 2021 to Rs226 as of today.
The brokerage house noted that many investors transferred their capital to fixed-income instruments in 2022 owing to rising interest rates. The policy rate in Pakistan increased from 9.75pc to 16pc in the outgoing year. As a result, the average gain on a three-month treasury bill remained 14pc. Similarly, local money market funds also generated a 14pc average return in 2022.
The average return on bank deposits, excluding current accounts, and Special Saving Certificates issued by the government was 11pc each in 2022.
The property sector, which is a popular investment avenue among Pakistanis, took a hit in 2022 on macroeconomic concerns. Indices tracking the prices of houses, plots and the residential property went up 12-14pc in 2022, it said.
Pakistan’s weak external account situation, rising interest rates and political uncertainty led to a lower level of enthusiasm among investors for equities and bonds.
The prices of government bonds fell owing to a rising policy rate. The benchmark 10-year Pakistan Investment Bond posted a negative return of 2pc.
The stock market along with equity-based mutual funds underperformed all major asset classes in 2022 with the benchmark KSE-100 index falling 10pc.

1,Pakistan lacks infrastructure to import Russian gas,Analysts say renewed discussion around gas imports from Russia won’t amount to much.,"KARACHI: The import of gas from Russia is still a distant dream for Pakistan despite the two countries’ willingness to play ball.
Analysts say the renewed discussion around gas imports from Russia won’t amount to much — at least in the short term — for two reasons. One, lack of infrastructure to handle gas imports; and two, inadequate capacity in the existing pipeline system to transport gas from one point to another.
“Gas wouldn’t start flowing anytime soon even if we bought it today. The infrastructure isn’t there. The issue has to be addressed on a long-term basis,” said Tahir Abbas, head of research at brokerage Arif Habib Ltd, while speaking to Dawn on Tuesday.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak told the press on Monday Russia was willing to sell natural gas to Pakistan through the “infrastructure of Central Asia or in a swap from the territory of Iran”.
Russia has been trying to diversify its energy buyers as it faces increasing global isolation following the invasion of Ukraine in February. One of the largest energy producers, Russia’s share in the global gas export market is around one-fifth.
A Russian delegation headed by its energy minister is due in Islamabad next month. Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik recently told journalists that Pakistan was already in talks with private and state-owned Russian firms for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
But the current LNG import infrastructure has excess capacity to handle only a few odd cargoes carrying gas of “200-300 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd)”, said Mr Abbas.
Pakistan has made little progress to expedite the construction of two long-overdue LNG terminals — Qatar-backed Energas LNG and Mitsubishi-backed Tabeer LNG. Each of the two terminals will have capacities of 750-1,000mmcfd.
Given the capacities of the two already operational terminals — Engro Elengy (690mmcfd) and GasPort LNG (750mmcfd) — the addition of the two “merchant” sites is supposed to more than double the country’s LNG import capacity.
Despite vociferous protests by the two terminal sponsors, there’s been little tangible progress from the 
state-owned gas utility companies on the allocation of 300mmcfd of pipeline capacity to each of them.
As for gas imports through Central Asian infrastructure (i.e. pipelines) that the Russian deputy prime minister referred to a day ago, analysts believe the proposal can only be pursued once Pakistan shows seriousness in developing the long-pending 683-mile pipeline from Karachi to Lahore with Russian help.
“The government should offer the Russians an attractive equity stake in the proposed pipeline and expedite its construction to realise sufficient gas imports from Russia,” he said.

2,"Lenders, bureaucrats blamed for power crisis","Pide study asks for a forensic audit of power firms, a complete halt on sovereign guarantees.","ISLAMABAD: The power sector default now stands at Rs2.5 trillion in addition to Rs2.6tr of circular debt despite over Rs3.4tr of subsidies paid since 2007 and total power sector losses of Rs5.7tr, a direct outcome of bad policies pursued by successive governments on the advice of the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and USAID.
The poor governance structure controlled by the federal bureaucracy without taming the independent power producers (IPPs) —the elephant in the room — has equally responsible for aggravating the power sector crisis.
Moreover, the sovereign guarantees provided by the government to borrow from commercial banks to finance the power sector deficit had crossed Rs2.055tr in September 2021 while crowding out the private sector borrowing. 

Pide study asks for a forensic audit of power firms, a complete halt on sovereign guarantees 

Power sector default (Rs2.5tr) refers to receivables of the electricity companies against various consumers including federal and provincial governments and private consumers.
Concluding this based on a fresh study, the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (Pide) — a state-run think tank — and the government differed publicly on the proposed induction of 10,000MW of renewable energy (RE) plants and proposed advanced metering infrastructure (AMIs) through the private sector. 
Launching “Power Sector: An Enigma with No Easy Solution,” Power Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan said the government was set to hold an auction for 600MW of RE plants in the first half of February and ramp this up to 10,000MW for fossil fuel replacement and give “massive push” for AMIs for loss reduction-starting with heavy users, followed by bulk consumers and eventually all consumers would have AMIs.
The study, co-authored by Pide Vice-Chancellor and former deputy chairman Planning Commission Nadeem-Ul-Haq and leading energy expert Tahir Basharat Cheema, on the other hand, among other things proposed “a moratorium on IPPs, including the proposed solar projects of 10,000MW” in the short term. 
The study was completed by “Pide Power Commission led by Mr Cheema and comprising incumbent and former public sector electricity experts including NTDC General Manager Planning Engr Salis Usman, former CEO of Faisalabad Electric Supply Company Engr Mujahid Islam Billah, CFO Pakistan Electric Power Company Basharat Ali,  Deputy Manager NTDC Engr Sajad Haider Syed, former GM National Power Control Centre (NPCC) Engr Masood Akhtar, PEPCO Director Finance Engr Azhar Iqbal,  GM Monitoring Power Planning & Monitoring Company Engr Adnan Riaz Mir and former GM NPCC Engr Abdul Qadeer Khan.
Mr Cheema said the study found startling results that all IPPs — from thermal to hydro to RES — earned exorbitant profits mainly through three means, including over-invoicing in power purchase agreements (PPAs), wrongful interpretation of various clauses of PPA or outright fraud — hence it could be safely concluded that “elephant in the room is the IPPs and we have not been able to take it out”.
He said most people keep bad-mouthing IPPs and yet have not been able to address the problem and hence it was imperative to conduct a forensic audit of the IPPs by the Auditor General of Pakistan assisted by the private sector financial experts and correct it where unfair earnings are found or stop criticising them.
The study suggests a forensic audit of both public and private generation companies immediately, followed by recoveries without any relaxation for any IPPs, and asks for a complete halt on sovereign guarantees to investors in the future. 
It also calls for a complete revamp of tariff design and to start the market with bilateral contracts keeping transmission constraints and participants’ capacities in mind.
“The root of this (power sector) challenge” comes from long-term and unviable contracts with private investors on the advice of the World Bank without analysing their impact and the mistake was repeated again and again, trapping the economy. 
The study says the sectoral managers and decision-makers, mostly non-professional bureaucrats could not tackle the circular debt and the power sector default because “they rely on WB, ADB, USAID advice, who don’t understand ground realities. The lenders and our bureaucracy are responsible for this prolonged menace” as structural issues remain untouched.
Former member PC Syed Akhtar Ali, however, cautioned against bashing IPPs, particularly Chinese investors and reminded that Reko Diq episode should be a guide and argued that the country would have earned $2bn by now with the implementation of the original Reko Diq agreement but instead we had to pay $1bn out of pocket for nothing.

3,SBP lifts curbs on import of essential items,"Allows opening of LCs for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides.","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan has eased imports of several essential items required as raw material and some basic needs of the exporters. 
A circular issued by the SBP on Tuesday stated that the central bank had decided to withdraw its instructions with effect from Jan 2, 2023, paving the way for acceptance of requests for import transactions already submitted to the SBP. 
Earlier, under circulars issued in May and July this year, the authorised dealers (banks) were required to seek permission from the SBP’s Foreign Exchange Operations Department before initiating any import transaction. 
Though the main hurdle in the way of imports is the country’s poor foreign exchange that still persists, the State Bank came out to facilitate the economy heading fast to hit rock bottom. 

Allows opening of LCs for seeds, fertilisers and pesticides

These restrictions were removed on Tuesday, but the central bank asked banks to prioritise items for imports under a list given by the SBP. Import of essential items such as food (wheat, edible oil, etc.), and pharmaceutical (raw material, life-saving/essential medicines), surgical instruments (stents, etc.) were allowed under the new circular. These sectors are under serious stress and shortage of medicines like life-saving drugs is common. 
Energy, agriculture imports 
The circular said that items related to petroleum group (oil and gas) and coal (for power projects based on merit order of the Ministry of Energy) could be imported without prior permission from the State Bank. 
According to analysts, Pakistan cannot put restrictions on import of energy as industries across the country are facing serious crisis. 
The State Bank also allowed imports by the export-oriented industry. It was a vital decision since the industry has come under pressure due to shortage of material and a decline in orders from the international market. Imports, especially of raw material, input goods and spare parts, by the export-oriented industries were allowed under the new circular. 
Imports of agriculture inputs were allowed to improve the falling output and yields on crops in the country. The State Bank allowed the import of items required as input for agriculture (seeds, fertilisers and pesticides). 
Due to the recent devastating floods, a large area of lands, particularly in Sindh, requires fertilisers and pesticides on a large scale. Pakistan needs to import about four million tonnes of wheat this year which could be met through improvement in yields per acre. 
The State Bank also allowed imports on a deferred payment basis, preferably from the parents or sisters concerned of the importers, beyond 365 days, from shipment date. 
Imports funded by foreign exchange available with the importers and raised through equity or project loan/import loan from abroad, in accordance with the applicable Foreign Exchange Regulations, have also been allowed. 
The import for export-oriented projects nearing completion has also been allowed. The import of plants and machinery (at least 75 per cent already imported) has been allowed for export-oriented projects under the latest circular. 
The State Bank said banks may actively engage with all their customers to process their requests, keeping in view the customers’ risk profile and liquidity conditions prevailing in the foreign exchange market.

5,KE consumers get Rs7.43 per unit relief,Nepra has increased KE's base tariff for three months by Rs3.30 per unit.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Tuesday decided to reduce fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for the consumers of K-Electric by Rs7.43 per unit for one month, but increased its base tariff for three months by Rs3.30 per unit to reduce government subsidy. 
On the other hand, the regulator allowed an increase of about 19 paise per unit for the consumers of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) under monthly fuel price adjustment and notified Rs3.60 per unit discount for farmers under the government’s Kissan package. 
During a public hearing, Nepra said the Central Power Purchasing Agency had sought an increase of Rs0.1938 per unit under monthly fuel cost adjustment for the month of November. However, after scrutiny of data and evidence, the regulator allowed an increase of Rs0.1857 per unit. 
In a separate hearing, the regulator said K-Electric had sought a reduction of Rs7 per unit in tariff under FCA, but based on evidence it calculated the reduction of 7.43 per unit, resulting in Rs10 billion relief for KE consumers on account of fuel cost adjustment for the month of November 2022. 
It was reported that lower FCAs had resulted because of a decline in prices of gas by six per cent, RLNG by 22pc and furnace oil by 16pc compared to the rates in September. KE officials said they did not utilise furnace oil for power generation in November in order to stabilise the system. 
It was reported that two units of KE’s Bin Qasim plant were currently generating 750MW and the generation would touch 900MW in a few days and hence there would be no shortage of electricity in the upcoming summer after full commissioning of the plant. 
The regulator directed KE to submit plan for reducing electricity generation cost within a week’s time. Both FCAs for KE and Discos would be made part of the coming billing month — January. 
Kissan package 
Nepra notified a Rs3.60 per unit reduction in power supply rates to private agricultural consumers under the Kissan package. It said the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet had on Nov 29 approved this reduction which was duly ratified by the federal cabinet on Nov 30. 
Under the decision, private agricultural consumers of all Discos and K-Electric would be provided a relief of Rs3.60/kWh in their current base rate of Rs16.80/kWh applicable under the July 25, 2022 notification. However, FCAs, QTAs and taxes and duties would be paid by the consumers as usual. 
The ECC also approved additional supplementary grant of Rs28bn with effect from Nov 1, 2022 and its release to the power division for implementation of the PM’s Kissan package.
