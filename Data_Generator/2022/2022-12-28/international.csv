0,Israel thanks Morocco for protecting Jews during Holocaust,JERUSALEM: Israeli President Isaac Herzog thanked Morocco’s King Mohammed VI for his country’s provision of...,"JERUSALEM: Israeli President Isaac Herzog thanked Morocco’s King Mohammed VI for his country’s provision of  “safe haven” for Jews during the Holocaust, in a missive seen by this news agency on Tuesday.
The letter — marking two years since Morocco normalised ties with Israel — was the first occasion an Israeli state official has paid tribute to the Holocaust-era actions of Morocco’s monarch at the time, according to the presidency.
Herzog expressed Israel’s gratitude to the king  “and the people of Morocco who, for generations, have acted to protect the security, welfare and cultural heritage of the kingdom’s Jewish community”.
Herzog mentioned Jews settling in Morocco following their expulsion from Spain in the late 15th century, before noting the North African country’s protection of Jews during World War II.
“When millions of Jews faced the horrors of the Holocaust in the 20th century, King Mohammed V provided a safe haven for his Jewish subjects,” Herzog said in the letter, dated December 22.
“Moroccan Jews recall with pride and affection the memory of your grandfather, His Majesty King Mohammed V, who is remembered as the protector and guardian of Jews in his realm,” Herzog added.
Mohammad V is famous for his refusal to apply anti-Jewish laws prescribed by France’s pro-German Vichy government during World War II.
Herzog praised the current king’s moves to support his country’s Jewish community, noting the decision to include Holocaust education in Moroccan schools.
Such a move would not only deepen  “your people’s commitment to tolerance and understanding but send a powerful message about these essential values to countries from the Atlantic to the Gulf”, Herzog wrote.
The presidency said the letter was coordinated with Israel’s foreign ministry and the state’s Yad Vashem Holocaust centre.
Rabat cut relations with Israel in 2000 following the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada. But in December 2020, the two countries formalised ties, following similar agreements earlier that year between Israel and Gulf countries the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
Before then, Israel had reached peace treaties with neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, in 1979 and 1994 respectively.
Morocco’s Jewish community dates to antiquity and grew in the 15th century with the expulsion of Spain’s Jews.
By the 1940s its number had grown to 250,000, representing 10 percent of the country’s population, but mass emigration followed Israel’s founding in 1948.
The kingdom’s Jewish community is now estimated to number some 3,000 people, the largest in North Africa. Approximately 700,000 Israelis claim Moroccan descent and maintain strong ties with their country of origin.

1,India inspects drug factories after Gambia deaths,An Indian company’s cough and cold syrups have been linked to deaths in Gambia.,"MUMBAI: India’s pharmaceuticals regulator has begun inspecting some drug factories across the country, the health ministry said on Tuesday, as it tries to ensure high standards after an Indian company’s cough and cold syrups were linked to deaths in Gambia.
India is known as the  “pharmacy of the world” and its pharmaceuticals exports have more than doubled over the past decade to $24.5 billion in the past fiscal year.
The deaths of at least 70 children in Gambia has dented the industry’s image, though India says the drugs made by New Delhi-based Maiden Pharmaceuticals Ltd were not at fault.
“Joint inspections are being conducted all over the country as per standard operating procedures,” the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in a statement.  “This will ensure high standards of quality compliance with respect to drugs manufactured in the country.”  The ministry said it was inspecting  “drug manufacturing units” that were at risk of making non-standard, adulterated, or spurious drugs but did not name any company.
Some health experts say India’s drug regulations are lax, especially at the level of states where thousands of factories operate. The government in October suspended all of Maiden’s production, based in the state of Haryana, for violation of manufacturing standards. But India’s main drugs officer told WHO this month that tests of samples from the same batches of syrups that Maiden sent to Gambia were compliant with government specifications.  A Gambian parliamentary committee said last week that Maiden was responsible for the deaths of 70 children from acute kidney injury and called on the government to pursue legal action.

2,Israeli ambassador to Turkiye presents credentials to Erdogan,Ceremony marks latest step in warming ties between Israel and Turkiye.,"JERUSALEM: Israel’s ambassador to Turkiye Irit Lillian on Tuesday presented her credentials to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the foreign ministry said, marking a new era after four years with the position unstaffed.
“A very emotional moment this afternoon as I presented my letter of credentials to the President,” Lillian, who had been serving as Israel’s charge d’affaires in Ankara, wrote on her Twitter account.
“Looking forward to many more positive developments in the bilateral relations”.

 





 
The ceremony at Erdogan’s presidential complex in Ankara marks the latest step in warming ties between Israel and Turkiye. Bilateral relations began to fray in 2008 following an Israeli military operation in Gaza.
Relations then froze in 2010 after the deaths of 10 civilians following an Israeli raid on the Turkish Mavi Marmara ship, part of a flotilla trying to breach a blockade by carrying aid into the Gaza enclave.
A brief reconciliation lasted from 2016 until 2018, when Turkiye withdrew its ambassador and expelled Israel’s over the killing of Palestinians during a conflict with Gaza.

3,Republican lawmaker-elect admits fabricating resume,NEW YORK: A Republican elected to Congress in November was facing a growing clamor for his resignation on Tuesday...,"NEW YORK: A Republican elected to Congress in November was facing a growing clamor for his resignation on Tuesday after admitting that he made up large parts of his biography — but refusing to give up his seat.
George Santos’s victory in a New York district helped his party secure a narrow majority in the House of Representatives — Congress’s lower chamber. But a New York Times investigation cast doubt on key parts of his education and work history that he touted during the campaign.
Santos admitted in two separate interviews on Monday to significant fabrications of his resume, confessing that he’d neither worked at Goldman Sachs and Citigroup nor graduated from college, despite his claims to the contrary.
The Republican refused to give up his seat in Congress, however, telling the New York Post,  “I’m not a criminal” — inviting comparisons with disgraced president Richard Nixon’s infamous 1973 declaration that  “I am not a crook.” Santos apologised for what he called  “embellishing my resume” but some of his justifications for his dishonesty bordered on the absurd, particularly his defence of his false claim that he was Jewish.
“I am Catholic. Because I learned my maternal family had a Jewish background I said I was ‘Jew-ish,’” he told the Post. Questions remain over Santos’s finances and Democrats have raised the possibility that he may have broken the law by lying in campaign disclosures.
Several members of President Joe Biden’s party have demanded that House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy call a vote to expel Santos if he does not quit. “His pitiful confession should not distract us from concerns about possible criminality and corruption,” New York congressman Ritchie Torres tweeted.
“The Ethics Committee MUST investigate how he made his money. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.” California congressman Eric Swalwell accused Santos of  “defrauding the voters of Long Island about his ENTIRE resume” while Democratic strategist Kurt Bardella urged McCarthy to  “demand his resignation.”  “If he refuses, Santos should not be seated by the new Congress,” Bardella added.
Santos, who beat Democrat Robert Zimmerman in a newly-drawn district straddling Queens and Long Island, was at the vanguard of a Republican  “wave” in New York that powered the party to a 222-212 House majority.
He initially posted a statement from his lawyer accusing the Times of  “attempting to smear his good name with these defamatory allegations.” McCarthy has been questioned by reporters in Congress over the allegations but has so far avoided responding.

4,Ship carrying 113 migrants allowed to dock in Italy,MARSEILLE: Italy will allow the Ocean Viking humanitarian ship to dock at an Italian port and disembark 113 people...,"MARSEILLE: Italy will allow the Ocean Viking humanitarian ship to dock at an Italian port and disembark 113 people rescued from the waters of the Mediterranean, a French NGO said on Tuesday.
The humanitarian vessel, run by SOS Mediterranee, was at the centre of a standoff between France and Italy in November, when Italy’s new far-right government under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni blocked access to its ports.
The 230 migrants on board at the time were eventually allowed to disembark in France after spending weeks at sea — heightening tensions between the two countries.
On Tuesday, SOS Mediterranee said the ship had been given permission to dock at the port of Ravenna in northeastern Italy, although it said it would take  “four long days of navigation” to reach it.
The migrants on board were rescued overnight Monday in international waters close to Libya, as the boat carried out its first rescue operation since docking in France last month.
Among those who had been rescued were 23 women including some who were pregnant, according to the NGO, plus around 30 unaccompanied minors and three babies. The youngest baby rescued is only three weeks old.
Every year many people fleeing Africa and the Middle East seek to enter Greece, Italy and Spain in hope of better lives in the European Union.
The International Organisation for Migration has recorded nearly 2,000 migrants as dead or missing in the Mediterranean Sea this year.

5,"Sushant’s death was murder,says mortuary staff",KARACHI: New developments in the Sushant Singh  Rajput case suggest that his death is not as simply conclusive as ...,"

Sushant Singh Rajput

 
KARACHI: New developments in the Sushant Singh  Rajput case suggest that his death is not as simply conclusive as it  seemed. It was ruled as a suicide but there are people ready to  challenge that even after two years, Dawn.com reported. 
A mortuary worker  said the autopsy revealed evidence of inflicted violence and the bodily  state matched that of a murder case. The Bollywood actor’s lawyer  reasserted that it was not a “simple suicide” and his sister Shweta  Singh Kirti has demanded the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)  investigate fairly.
In an interview with TV9 Marathi, Roopkumar  Shah, who was present when Sushant’s body was brought in for postmortem,  said, “After Sushant’s death, five bodies were brought for postmortem.  We were told that there is a VIP body in it, but it was not known  earlier. When I saw Sushant’s body, I told the seniors that I think it  is not suicide but murder. That’s why we should work in the same way.  But I was told that you do your work and I will do mine. My job was to  cut and sew the body, which I did. That entire postmortem should have  been videographed but sir said he wanted to work on the photographs and  hand over the body as soon as possible. That’s how we did the postmortem  at night.
“When the clothes were removed, there were beating  marks on the body. There were injury marks at two or three places on the  neck. It seemed as if the hands and legs were broken due to beating…  There were deep injury marks on the body. The video shoot was to happen  but whether it happened or not… Seniors were also asked to work on the  photos only. So we worked on it,” he added, according to Hindustan  Times.
Sushant’s lawyer Vikas Singh reacted to the reports and  told Etimes that though he does not have any direct information about  the injuries on the actor’s body as claimed by the alleged eyewitness,  he knows something bigger was at play. “I will not be able to comment on  the same as the sisters have not told me about it. But I maintain that  Sushant Singh Rajput’s death was not a simple suicide as there was a  conspiracy behind it. And only the CBI will be able to unravel the  conspiracy behind his death.”
Shweta took to Instagram and re-shared a photo of Sushant with a headline talking about the mortuary worker’s account. 
“If  there is an ounce of truth to this evidence, we urge [the] CBI to  really look into it diligently. We have always believed that you guys  will do a fair investigation and let us know the truth. Our heart aches  to find no closure as yet,” she added. The late actor’s sister has been  very active on social media in her fight for justice for his death.
Sushant  was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai. While there was no note, the  Mumbai Police ruled it a suicide. The 34-year-old’s death is being  investigated by the CBI. His girlfriend Rhea Chakraborty was arrested in  2020 and 2021 for purchasing and financing narcotics for her late  boyfriend. Though the murder angle was ruled out, no closure report has  been filed so far by the agency.

6,UN urges countries to help Rohingya at sea as hundreds land in Indonesia,UNHCR says nearly 500 Rohingya have reached Indonesia in the past six weeks.,"

A ROHINGYA refugee feeds a child at a temporary shelter in Indonesia’s Aceh province on Tuesday.—Reuters

 
PIDIE: The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) urged countries on Tuesday to help Rohingya Muslims stranded at sea as at least 20 reportedly died and hundreds more landed in Indonesia after weeks adrift in the Indian Ocean.
Nearly 500 Rohingya have reached Indonesia in the past six weeks while  “many others did not act despite numerous pleas and appeals for help”, the UNHCR said in a statement.
It said on Monday said 2022 could be one of the deadliest years at sea in almost a decade for the Rohingya with a growing number of them fleeing desperate conditions in refugee camps in Bangladesh. One boat carrying 180 people is believed to have sunk in early December, with all on board presumed dead, according to rights groups.
The Rohingya have long been persecuted in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, which borders Bangladesh. For years many have fled to neighbouring states like Thailand and Bangladesh, and to Muslim-majority Malaysia and Indonesia between November and April when seas are calmer.
Nearly 1 million live in crowded conditions in Bangladesh, including many of the hundreds of thousands who fled a deadly crackdown in 2017 by Myanmar’s military, which denies committing crimes against humanity.
Rights groups have recorded a significant increase in the number leaving the camps, from about 500 last year to an estimated 2,400 this year. It is not clear what is driving the larger exodus. Some activists believe the lifting of Covid restrictions around Southeast Asia, a favoured destination for the Rohingya, could be a factor.
’Dangerous voyages’
A boat washed ashore in Aceh province on the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Monday carrying 174 Rohingya, most of them dehydrated, fatigued and in need of urgent medical care after weeks at sea, local disaster agency officials said. Some survivors recounted stories of hunger and desperation, saying more than 20 of the passengers died on the way.
“We came here from the largest Bangladesh refugee camp with the hope that the Indonesian people would give us the opportunity of education,” said Umar Farukh, who spoke in a shelter crowded with Rohingya men, women and children receiving care from Indonesian medics.
Thai authorities said after rescuing six people found clinging to a water tank floating in the Andaman Sea that the survivors reported their boat being denied access to Malaysia and turning back towards Bangladesh. Malaysia’s Maritime Enforcement Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Monday’s landing in Indonesia was the latest in a series of Rohingya boat landings and rescues around the region in recent weeks, prompting Bangladesh authorities to try and stop people from risking their lives on boats to Southeast Asia.
“We’re doing everything possible to stop them from taking the dangerous voyages,” Bangladeshi Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Mohammad Mizanur Rahman said on Monday.

7,South Korea’s military apologises for not downing North’s drones,SEOUL: South Korea’s military apologised on Tuesday for failing to shoot down five North Korean drones that ...,"SEOUL: South Korea’s military apologised on Tuesday for failing to shoot down five North Korean drones that crossed their shared border after facing wide criticism over its lack of readiness.
Monday’s incursion prompted Seoul to fire warning shots and deploy fighter jets and attack helicopters to shoot down the drones, one of which flew close to the capital.
“Yesterday, five enemy drones invaded South Korean airspace, and our military detected and tracked them, but we apologise for not being able to shoot them down,” the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement. All of the drones appeared to have returned to the North despite an operation to hunt them down that lasted five hours.
The JCS acknowledged that, while the military can counter  “attack drones that pose a real threat”, there is a limit to their ability to detect and strike smaller spy drones.
“As a result, the military’s lack of readiness has caused a lot of concern to the public,” it said.
South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday the incident showed that the military’s readiness was  “greatly lacking”. Yoon ordered an acceleration of a plan to launch a drone unit to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance operations on North Korea’s key military facilities. The plan includes introducing advanced stealth drones.
The incursion was the first time in years that North Korean drones had entered the South’s airspace and closely followed a recent flurry of sanctions-busting weapons tests by Pyongyang.

8,AI sees big improvements in stroke treatment,LONDON: Artificial intelligence technology has tripled the number of UK stroke patients recovering to a point where...,"LONDON: Artificial intelligence technology has tripled the number of UK stroke patients recovering to a point where they can perform daily activities, according to new research released on Tuesday.
Early stage analysis of over 111,000 suspected stroke patients whose care included use of the technology found it reduced the time between being seen by a doctor and treatment beginning by over 60 minutes, leading to improved results.
The proportion who were able to resume day-to-day activities increased from 16 to 48 per cent, the analysis of the Brainomix e-Stroke imaging platform found.
The technology, developed by the UK’s med-tech solution firm Brainomix, is being used across 11 stroke treatment networks in the UK’s state-funded National Health Service (NHS) to diagnose strokes and determine the best treatment.
The platform helps doctors in the interpretation of brain scans and allows them to share the images with specialists worldwide who can access them remotely.
“AI has the potential to transform our NHS — delivering faster, more accurate diagnoses and making sure patients can get the treatment they need, when they need it,” the UK’s health secretary Steve Barclay said in a statement.

9,Taiwan extends mandatory army service over China threat,"China’s ""intimidation and threats against Taiwan are getting more obvious,"" President Tsai Ing-wen says.","TAIPEI: Taiwan on Tuesday announced an extension in mandatory military service from four months to one year, citing the threat from an increasingly hostile China.
Beijing considers self-ruled, democratic Taiwan a part of its territory, to be taken one day, by force if necessary, and the island lives under the constant fear of a Chinese invasion.
China’s sabre-rattling has intensified in recent years under President Xi Jinping, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has further deepened worries in Taiwan that Beijing might move similarly to annex the island.
China’s  “intimidation and threats against Taiwan are getting more obvious”, President Tsai Ing-wen told a press conference after a high-level government meeting on national security.
“No one wants war... but my fellow countrymen, peace will not fall from the sky.”  “The current four-month military service is not enough to meet the fast and ever-changing situation,” she said.  “We have decided to restore the one-year military service from 2024.” The extended requirement will apply to men born after January 1, 2005, Tsai added.
Mandatory service used to be deeply unpopular in Taiwan, and its previous government had reduced it from one year to four months with the aim of creating a mainly volunteer force. But recent polling showed more than three-quarters of the Taiwanese public now believes that is too short.
Tsai described the extension as  “an extremely difficult decision... to ensure the democratic way of life for our future generations”.
“We can only avoid a war by preparing for a war and we can only stop a war by being capable of fighting a war.” 
The prospect of a Chinese invasion has increasingly worried Western nations and many of China’s neighbours. Xi has made clear that what he calls the  “reunification” of Taiwan cannot be passed on to future generations. Taiwan and China split at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, and Tsai has said becoming a part of China is not acceptable to the people of the island.
Taiwan is a mountainous island and would present a formidable challenge to an invading force, but it is massively outgunned with 89,000 ground forces compared with China’s one million, according to a Pentagon estimate released last month.

10,Armageddon to wet lettuce: the phrases that defined 2022,"PARIS: In a year of extraordinary upheaval, from the war in Ukraine to catastrophic natural disasters, this news...","PARIS: In a year of extraordinary upheaval, from the war in Ukraine to catastrophic natural disasters, this news agency looks at some of the words and phrases that have defined 2022.
Armageddon 
With the war in Ukraine and increasingly strident threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin, the spectre of nuclear warfare is stalking the globe for the first time in decades. “We have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban missile crisis” in 1962, US President Joe Biden said in October.
Experts warned of the most dangerous situation they can remember, with fears not limited to Russia: North Korean nuclear sabre-rattling has reached new heights, with the world bracing for a first nuclear test since 2017.
London Bridge
At 6:30 pm on Sept 8, Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II had died, bringing to an end the longest reign in British history and sending shockwaves around the world. For 10 days, Britons paid respects to the only monarch most had known, following a carefully choreographed series of ceremonies.
The programme of events, famously codenamed  “London Bridge”, set out in minute detail every aspect of the protocol — down to BBC presenters wearing black ties.
In the event, she died in Scotland, meaning special provisions came into force — Operation Unicorn.
Loss and damage 
World leaders and negotiators descended on the Egyptian Red Sea port of Sharm el-Sheikh for the latest United Nations summit (COP27) on tackling climate change.
After a fractious summit, widely seen as poorly organised, a deal was clinched on a fund for  “loss and damage” to help vulnerable countries cope with the devastating impacts of climate change. Behind the institutional-sounding name lies destruction for millions in the developing world.
The summit was hailed as historic but many voiced anger over a lack of ambition on cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
Woman. Life. Freedom 
The chant screamed by protesters in Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman arrested by the Tehran morality police. 
Protesters have burned posters of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and women have appeared in public without headscarves, in scenes scarcely imaginable before the uprising.
The demonstrations have lasted more than three months and appear to pose an existential challenge to the 43-year rule of the clerical regime.
Blue tick 
The tiny blue tick (it’s actually white on a blue background), which certifies users on Twitter, became a symbol of the chaos engulfing the social media platform in the wake of its $44 billion takeover by Elon Musk. The mercurial Tesla boss announced that anyone wanting the coveted blue tick would have to stump up eight dollars, only to scrap the plan hours later — and then reintroduce a more complicated system several weeks afterwards.
Nearly two months on from the takeover, Twitter’s future remains up in the air, with thousands of staff laid off, advertisers leaving, and Musk himself vowing to step down as CEO as soon as he finds someone  “foolish” enough to take over, after an online poll found a majority wanted him gone.
Roe v. Wade 
In an historic ruling, the conservative-dominated US Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973  “Roe v. Wade” decision that enshrined a woman’s right to an abortion.
The Supreme Court ruled that individual states could restrict or ban the procedure — a decision seized upon by several right-leaning states. Protests erupted instantly in Washington and elsewhere, showing how divisive the topic remains in the United States. The overturning of  “Roe v. Wade” became a critical battle in the US mid-terms, in which candidates in favour of abortion rights won several victories.
Wet lettuce 
As Liz Truss approached the end of her chaotic and short-lived tenure as British prime minister, the Economist weekly mused that her effective period in office had been  “roughly the shelf-life of a lettuce”.
The tabloid Daily Star leapt on the idea, launching a live web cam featuring the said vegetable — complete with googly eyes — next to a picture of the hapless Truss.
Her premiership lasted just 44 days and featured a mini-budget that collapsed the markets and generated extraordinary political upheaval. In the end, the lettuce won.
Tomato soup 
Environmental protesters seeking to draw attention to the role of fossil fuel consumption in the climate crisis hurled tomato soup at Vincent Van Gogh’s  “Sunflowers” painting at London’s National Gallery in October, touching off a series of similar stunts.
Since then, activists have smothered mashed potato on Claude Monet and glued themselves to works by Andy Warhol, Francisco Goya and Johannes Vermeer. For some, the campaigners are heroes bravely drawing attention to the climate emergency. For others, the attacks are counterproductive and lose force by becoming commonplace.

11,Fly away home: Rare Eastern Sarus cranes released in Thailand,The move is the latest effort to revive the almost-extinct species in the kingdom.,"BURIRAM: As the sun came up, 13 Thai Eastern Sarus cranes were released over a rippling reservoir in northeast Thailand, the latest effort to revive the almost-extinct species in the kingdom.
More commonly known as Thai cranes, the birds nearly disappeared from the country roughly 50 years ago — they were last spotted in the wild in 1968 — before a collaboration between the Thai government, Nakhon Ratchasima Zoo and United Nations to save them.
A breeding programme, using fowl donated by Cambodia, began in 1989, with the first reintroduction in 2011.
Sarus cranes are classed by the ICNC as  “vulnerable”, with an estimated 15,000 remaining in the wild — with the Thai sub-species having been thought to have disappeared from Thailand’s wild wetlands. But since 2011, more than 150 captively-bred birds — which can grow to up to six feet and weigh almost seven kilograms — have been released in Buriram province. “It is the only place where the Thai cranes are able to live and reproduce on their own,” said Governor Chaiwat Chuntirapong.
The birds were transported in large, specially adapted boxes — their red-feathered heads watching through mesh windows — from the Wetland and Eastern Sarus Crane Conservation Centre where they were bred to the Huai Chorakhe Mak Reservoir.
The latest flock of 13 cranes were released all at once on Christmas Day.
The tall birds loudly honked and clumsily flapped as they unsteadily took to the skies accompanied by cheering children and spectators.

12,Iranian woman competes at chess tournament without hijab,Sara Khadem is ranked 804 in the world.,"DUBAI: An Iranian chess player has taken part in an international tournament without a hijab, according to media reports, the latest of several Iranian sportswomen to appear at competitions without one since anti-government protests began.
Iran has been swept by demonstrations against the country’s clerical leadership since mid-September, when 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini died in the custody of morality police who detained her for  “inappropriate attire”.
Iranian news outlets Khabarvarzeshi and Etemad, in reports on Monday, said Sara Khadem had competed at the FIDE World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in Almaty, Kazakhstan, without the hijab — a headscarf mandatory under Iran’s strict dress codes.
Photos posted by both outlets appeared to show her with no headscarf during the tournament. Khabarvarzeshi also posted a photo of her wearing a headscarf but without saying if it was taken at the same event. There was no comment on Khadem’s Instagram page about the tournament or the reports.
Khadem, born in 1997 and also known as Sarasadat Khademalsharieh, is ranked 804 in the world, according to the International Chess Federation website. The website for the Dec 25-30 event listed her as a participant in both the Rapid and Blitz competitions. 
The protests mark one of the boldest challenges to Iran’s leadership since its 1979 revolution and have drawn in Iranians from all walks of life. Women have played a prominent role, removing and in some cases burning headscarves, while protesters have taken heart from what they have seen as shows of support from both female and male Iranian athletes.
In October, Iranian climber Elnaz Rekabi competed in South Korea without a headscarf, later saying she had done so unintentionally.
In November, an Iranian archer said she did not notice her hijab falling during an awards ceremony in Tehran, after a video appeared to show her allowing the headscarf to drop in what was also widely assumed to be a show of support for protesters.
In comments reported by state media in November, Iran’s deputy sports minister, Maryam Kazemipour, said some Iranian female athletes had acted against Islamic norms and then apologised for their actions.
Several national sports teams have refrained from singing the national anthem, notably before Iran’s opening match at the soccer World Cup. The team sang ahead of their second and third games. Iranian authorities have cracked down hard on the protests, which they have declared riots fomented by foreign adversaries.
According to the activist HRANA news agency, 507 protesters had been killed as of Thursday, including 69 minors. Sixty-six members of the security forces have also been killed. State officials have said up to 300 have been killed, including members of the security forces.

Medvedev,  deputy head of President Putin’s advisory security council, served as  president during a four-year spell when Putin held the office of prime  minister. He appears to have seen his fortune rise in the Kremlin, which  said on Monday he would now serve as Putin’s deputy on a body  overseeing the military industry.  
In his list of predictions for  2023, published on his personal Telegram and Twitter accounts, he also  foresaw Britain rejoining the EU, which would in turn collapse.  
Musk,  the Tesla boss who now owns Twitter, responded to the suggestion he  would emerge as US president by tweeting back “Epic thread!!”, although  he also criticised some of Medvedev’s predictions.  
Medvedev has praised Musk in the past for proposing Ukraine cede territory to Russia in a peace deal.  
Since  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Medvedev has reinvented himself as an  arch-hawk, framing the conflict in apocalyptic, religious terms and  referring to Ukrainians as  “cockroaches” in language Kyiv says is  openly genocidal.  
Last week he made a rare foreign visit to China, holding talks on foreign policy with President Xi Jinping.  
Political  scientist Vladimir Pastukhov said Medvedev’s newly outspoken public  persona appeared to have found favour with his boss.  
“Medvedev’s  Telegram posts have found at least one reader, and indeed an admirer:  Putin,” Pastukhov, a  political science professor at London’s University  College, wrote on his own Telegram.

14,Ringleader in plot to kidnap US governor gets 16 years’ jail,WASHINGTON: The leader of a foiled plot by members of right-wing militia groups to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen...,"WASHINGTON: The leader of a foiled plot by members of right-wing militia groups to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer was sentenced to 16 years in prison on Tuesday in a US District Court, prosecutors said.
Adam Fox, 39, was found guilty in August by a federal court jury in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on one count each of conspiring to abduct Whitmer, a Democrat, and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction in a scheme prosecutors said was intended to spark a  “second American Revolution.” 
Co-defendant Barry Croft Jr., 47, like Fox a member of the Three Percenters militia group, was convicted of the same charges at the same trial and was scheduled for sentencing on Wednesday.
Prosecutors described Fox as the mastermind behind a plot to break into Whitmer’s vacation home, kidnap her at gunpoint, and take her to stand  “trial” on bogus treason charges and face execution.
US District Court Judge Richard Jonker said he did not think a life sentence, as asked for by prose
cutors, was appropriate, but that the crimes required a “significant sentence,” the Detroit 
News reported. Fox declined to speak during the sentencing and had no reaction to the sentence, the report added.
The judge also imposed five years of supervised release beyond the sentence of 192 months in prison, prosecutors said.
Fox’s attorney had said prosecutors overstated his role. The attorney added that Fox and Croft never used explosives and the group would never have been able to actually kidnap the governor.
Prosecutors said the plot, precipitated by the group’s opposition to public health measures Whitmer imposed during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, was aimed at pushing the country into armed conflict as a contentious presidential race approached in November 2020.
The weapon of mass destruction involved was a bomb that prosecutors said the conspirators planned to detonate to hinder law enforcement’s response to the abduction.
Whitmer, co-chairman of Joe Biden’s White House campaign that year, had clashed publicly with 
then-president Donald Trump over her Covid-19 policies.
She accused Trump of fomenting political extremism by repeatedly directing heated rhetoric on the issue, including a campaign rally in Michigan where his criticism of Whitmer drew chants of  “Lock her up” from the crowd. Fox and Croft were among 13 men arrested in October 2020 in the kidnapping conspiracy.
Two others put on trial with them in federal court were found not guilty in April 2022. The same jury failed to reach a verdict for Fox and Croft, resulting in a mistrial for them. 
Two other men who pleaded guilty to kidnapping conspiracy charges testified for the prosecution at the first federal trial and during the retrial of Fox and Croft about four months later.
The two cooperating witnesses, Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, were sentenced to 2 1/2 years and four years in prison, respectively. 
Three other men tried together in state court and convicted in October 2022 of playing supporting roles in the plot as members of the Wolverine Watchmen militia were sentenced recently to minimum 
sentences of 10, 12 and 7 years in prison, respectively.
