• PTI MNAs to meet NA speaker upon latter’s return
GARHI KHUDA BUKHSH / ISLAMABAD: The leaders of two major political parties on Tuesday urged Imran Khan to return to parliament, saying that his and his party’s salvation lay in representing the citizens who had elected them.
But in the same breath, both Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Chaudhry Shujaat Huss­ain warned Mr Khan that if he persisted on his current course, they would neither be able to save him, nor would it benefit the country.
In separate statements on Tuesday, both leaders stressed the need for all parties to work together to rescue Pakistan from the economic and political dire straits that the country finds itself in.
“You are a stranger to the house. Come back and play your role in the parliament. Let’s talk about reforms, whether it is the National Accountability Bureau or elections,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari said during an address at Garhi Khuda Bukhsh, adding that otherwise, the government would not be able to stop those who wanted to “victimise you”.
“If he calls himself a politician and a democrat, he has to sit in parliament and do his job.”

Meanwhile, speaking at an event in Islamabad, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain said that the constituents who had elected Mr Khan and his party were observing the actions of their representatives, adding that not coming to the assembly and collecting salaries and perks would not accomplish anything.
Verification attempts
The remarks from both leaders came as Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers attempted to gain an audience with the National Assembly speaker for the personal verification of their resignations from the lower house of parliament.
However, since Raja Pervaiz Ashraf was in Garhi Khuda Buksh to participate in the event held to mark the 15th death anniversary of slain PPP leader and former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, it was resolved that a delegation of senior PTI leaders would call on the speaker soon after his return.
A spokesperson for the NA Secretariat confirmed that former PTI chief whip Malik Amir Dogar contacted the speaker via telephone on Tuesday, a move that was hailed by the speaker, who welcomed the gesture and said that “the dialogue process should continue”.
 






The spokesperson said Mr Dogar requested a formal meeting to deliberate upon the issue of confirmation of resignations of 124 PTI members of the National Assembly.
Mr Dogar told the NA speaker that a delegation of PTI leaders consisting of Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Pervez Khattak and others wanted to meet him.
But PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry told journalists in Lahore that when party leaders called on Mr Ashraf today, he was “nowhere to be found”.
“[We were] told that the speaker has gone to Larkana,” Fawad claimed. “We’re getting information that he’s going to Australia afterwards.”
“I want to tell the speaker that tendering resignations is our constitutional right,” the PTI leader said, adding that Mr Ashraf should “accept the resignations and hold countrywide elections”.
‘PPP, not US, ousted Imran’
In a wide ranging speech delivered at an event held to mark his mother’s death anniversary, Mr Bhutto-Zardari touched on a host of political issues.
He refuted Mr Khan’s ‘foreign conspiracy’ mantra, saying that it was his party, not Washington, that had engineered his ouster through democratic means.
“We sent Imran home through the Constitution […] and this was the first time the parliament ousted a prime minister. The ‘conspiracy against the selected’ was not hatched behind closed doors, rather it happened on the streets and in the parliament in plain sight.”
He went on to say that the military had made its position clear, i.e. they were staying out of politics clear. “It is now time to ensure that they fulfil their promise,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari said, adding that this was the reason why “we are hearing screams from Bani Gala”.
Saying that his party had played its part in the legislature for four years, the PPP leader said this was the PTI chief’s “last warning” to play his role. “We will negotiate with you on electoral and NAB reforms,” he said, adding that they did not want Mr Khan to go jail or face the accountability body.
He also pointed towards the arrest of Mayam Nawaz and Faryal Talpur during Mr Khan’s time in power, saying: “If you tamper with the Constitution, something will happen”.
Separately, in his remarks at a dinner in Islamabad, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain extolled the need to work “not for the interests of parties, rather the interests of Pakistan”.
He said that political and economic stability are crucial for the country and the general elections should be held on time.
“Only if we all come together for the sake of Pakistan can we save it. In case we cannot set aside our differences, all will be lost,” he said.
Chaudhry Shujaat also pointed to the economic crisis plaguing the country, saying that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would only extend its support if political parties could set aside their differences.
“We will act sternly against those who are just trying to raise their importance in the eyes of enemy nations,” he said, without elaborating.

1,Policeman shot dead as Gwadar protest rages on,Balochistan govt to register case against Haq Do Tehreek leader; protesters accuse govt of fomenting violence.,"

Constable Yasir Saeed

 
QUETTA / GWADAR: Balo­chistan Home Minister Ziaullah Langove has directed the province’s police to register a case against Haq Do Tehreek leader Maulana Hidayatur Rehman after a policeman was shot dead by unidentified assailants during a demonstration in Gwadar.
The killing of the policeman came a day after dozens of HDT protesters were rounded up by the police after talks between the protesters and the government failed to end the two-month-long sit-in led by Mr Rehman. 
The situation in the city remained tense on Tuesday as well. Roads linking the port city with other parts of the province remained blocked as protesters continued to agitate for their demands. 
According to sources, the protesters demanding the release of their comrades arrested by police on Monday tried to enter the office of the DIG Makran Range, located near Syed Hashmi Chowk, but they were pushed back by police.

Balochistan govt to register case against HDT leader; protesters accuse govt of fomenting violence

Sources claimed when the protesters reached Syed Has­hmi Chowk, shots fired by unknown individuals injured a police constable, identified as Yasir Saeed. A doctor at Gwadar Development Autho­rity Hospital, after examining the body of the policeman who had succumbed to injuries, said Constable Yasir received one bullet in the neck. It proved fatal.
Yasir Saeed Ari, 21, a resident of Nasirabad, had joined the police force only a year ago and was posted in the port city of Gwadar. Police officials said that Constable Yasir was deployed for the protection of the protestors when he was shot in the neck. The body of the police constable would be brought to Dera Murad Jamali on Wednesday and would be buried in his native village.
Volatile situation
In view of the volatile situation in the port city, the provincial government deployed extra contingents of police in and around the port and other sensitive areas. Meanwhile, the HDT leader blamed the government for the violence in the port city. In a tweet, he said that the HDT movement had remained peaceful for two months. He claimed the government was resorting to violence after caving into the demands of the “mafia”.
It may be noted here that HDT chief Maulana Hidayatur Rehman has refused to call off the protest till the acceptance of their demands. Among the protestors’ demands are stopping illegal fishing by trawlers in Balochistan’s maritime boundaries, recovery of missing persons, maximum concessions in border trade with Iran, end to narcotics, and other Gwadar-related issues.
Condemnation
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo and Home Minister Ziaullah Langove condemned the killing of the policeman and vowed action against miscreants. They claimed that despite the efforts of the provincial government to resolve issues through negotiations, the HDT leader “provoked the people to take the law into their hands”.
“The elements involved in firing and killing of police constable would not be spared and soon would be brought to justice,” they said and added that the government would not tolerate violence.
Inspector General Police Abdul Khaliq Sheikh also took notice of the firing on police and ordered the arrest of elements involved in the attack.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Balochistan police said that the HDT leader was “resorting to violence” to achieve his political goals. In a statement issued late evening, the spokesperson said police were making all-out efforts to protect the lives and property of the general public.

2,Schools to stay shut till Jan 9 in smog-hit Lahore,Average AQI reading touches 191,"LAHORE: As Punjab’s capital still stands among the cities with worst air quality levels despite a state of environmental emergency in place since Dec 6, the Lahore High Court directed the education department on Tuesday to extend winter vacation in public and private schools across the city for another week.
After the court order, the vacation will continue till Jan 9 due to smog.
Justice Shahid Karim passed the order while hearing public interest petitions by Haroon Farooq and others on different environmental issues. The judge observed that the government was responsible for controlling smog, and summoned the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) director general at the next hearing.
Previously, the judge also ordered the administration to ensure closure of markets and restaurants at 10pm as a measure to control smog.
On Tuesday, the average reading of Lah­ore on the Air Quality Index was measured 191 while Karachi ranked fifth on the list of cities having the worst air quality in the world.

Average AQI reading touches 191

The AQI is calculated on the basis of five categories of pollution: ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. An AQI rating as high as 151-200 is considered unhealthy, while one bet­ween 201 and 300 is more harmful and AQI over 300 is extremely hazardous.
According to experts, an increase in air pollution used to be recorded in the winter. A change in the wind speed, wind direction and sliding minimum temperature increases air pollution. Air becomes heavier in winter as compared to summer, causing poisonous particles in the atmosphere to move downwards and making the atmosphere polluted. As a result, a layer of polluted particles, including large amounts of carbon and smoke, covers an area.
The smoke produced by burning crop remnants, factories and burning coal, garbage, oil or tyres enters the atmosphere and the impact of this appears at the onset of winter and remains till the season’s end, experts said. The government had banned crop residue burning, shifting brick kilns to zigzag technology, raising anti-smog squads to check vehicular and industrial emissions and closing educational institutions, yet desired results are awaited.
The state of emergency declared by the authorities three weeks ago also could not do much good for the residents because almost all areas of the city remained under smog cover most of the time.
Smog towers
Punjab University Environmental Sciences Department Principal Prof Dr Sajid Rashid told Dawn that the government had imposed an environmental emergency in the city but failed to implement it. People were still burning waste in Lahore and setting fire to crops residue around the city whereas no measures were taken to stop them even after a ban had been imposed by the government, he added.
He said China had installed smog towers in the most polluted cities but Pakistan did not have equipment and money to install costly smog towers.
Mr Rashid explained that smog tower would clean the air and remove all the hazardous particles from it. 
However, he said, due to paucity of fund, people in Punjab could only wait for rain to clear the air. He advised public to take precautionary measures on its own as they did not have any other resource to avoid smog.
Talking to Dawn, Punjab Environment Protection Department Director Nasimur Reman said R2 billion interest-free loans were proposed for the industry to install emission control systems in their factories, especially steel mills and furnace mills. Around 60 per cent of the brick kiln were shifted to ZigZag technology and the remaining would also be shifted in a year or two, he claimed.
He also claimed the air quality of the city had improved if one compared 2021 and 2022 air quality index. He said smog situation was controlled this year and it would be better next year.

4,ECP postpones Islamabad LG polls at eleventh hour,"• Officials say fresh delimitation process, issuance of new schedule could take up to four months • Islamabad High Court issu...","• Officials say fresh delimitation process, issuance of new schedule could take up to four months
• Islamabad High Court issues notices to election watchdog, govt on PTI’s appeal
ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday put an end to the uncertainty surrounding the local government elections in Islamabad as it postponed the polls “for the time being” at the last minute, frustrating thousands of contestants and their supporters.  
The decision was announced by the election watchdog after a five-member bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, conducted a hearing on the issue in the light of the Islamabad High Court’s directives.
“Keeping in view the legal provisions and the judgement of the Honourable High Court, Islamabad dated Dec 23, 2022, regarding the subject matter. Local Government Elections in ICT scheduled to be held on Dec 31, 2022, is hereby postponed for the time being,” the short order by the ECP said. 
Though the ECP did not give any timeframe for the next election date, after conversations with officials concerned, it would be safe to assume that local bodies polls would be held after April because of the new delimitation process.
After a new bill passed by parliament — yet to be signed by the president — the number of union councils increased from 101 to 125. According to officials, if elections are to be held in 125 councils, fresh delimitation will be required, which could take up to two months. Following the delimitation process, the ECP would issue a new schedule encompassing two months at least. All this would take four months at least, the officials said. 
ECP hearing
During a hearing at the ECP, former attorney general Ashtar Ausaf, who represented the government, argued that the Islamabad High Court had given a decision regarding the local body elections while the Islamabad administration recommended an increase in the number of union councils. He urged the ECP to consider the government’s request in view of an increase in the city’s population to make the election process ‘transparent and inclusive’. 
PTI counsel Babar Awan pointed out that the aforementioned bill has not been signed by President Arif Alvi as yet. He remarked that it was the responsibility of the Election Commission to conduct elections as per the Constitution. Since the government was also contesting elections just like the PTI, it cannot dictate the terms, he added.
Jamaat-i-Islami’s lawyer Hassan Javed argued that it was the responsibility of the Election Commission to conduct the elections and added that the interference of the federal government was tantamount to limiting the powers of the commission.
just like the PTI, it cannot dictate the terms, he added.
Jamaat-i-Islami’s lawyer Hassan Javed argued that it was the responsibility of the ECP to conduct the elections and added that the interference of the federal government was tantamount to limiting the powers of the commission.
The CEC said that the high court asked the election watchdog to review the number of union councils. The JI counsel responded that the court had not limited the authority of the commission. During the hearing, CEC Raja said the government had put the election watchdog into an awkward spot by increasing the number of union councils at the last minute. 
After the completion of the arguments, the ECP issued a short ruling and postponed the local body elections.
Notices to ECP
Earlier in the day, the Islamabad High Court (IHC), while hearing a petition filed by PTI challenging the single bench’s decision, issued notices to the commission and the federal government. 
A division bench, comprising Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, took up the petition filed by PTI leader Ali Nawaz Awan. 
PTI lawyer Sardar Taimoor Aslam argued that earlier this year the IHC decided the pleas pertaining to the local bodies polls in the federal capital.
He argued that earlier the LG elections were delayed in June as the government after the announcement of the schedule increased the number of Union Councils from 50 to 101. 
He said that while the ECP has announced the schedule for holding elections on Dec 31 in 101 UCs, 
the government again increased their numbers from 101 to 125.
He said that the government took this decision when the ECP had made the arrangements to conduct polls, the contesting candidates were winding up election campaigns and the polling staff had already been notified for various polling stations.
Justice Kayani remarked that earlier, the previous government of PTI was not interested in holding the elections and now the incumbent government seemed reluctant to hold the polls.
The counsel said that the government had given an undertaking to the court to hold the elections in 101 UCs. He added that the PTI filed a petition seeking contempt of court proceedings against the government for flouting the court orders.
The counsel requested the court to restrain the ECP from announcing an order on the LG elections. However, the court refused to issue such directions and adjourned the hearing till Wednesday (today).
