0,ECP’s move to defer Islamabad local govt polls draws candidates’ ire,"PTI, JI to move court; PML-N, PPP candidates unhappy with postponement.","ISLAMABAD: The decision to postpone local government (LG) elections in the capital has irked contestants across the political divide, who expressed resentment against the government and election watchdog for calling off polls at the eleventh hour, costing them a lot of money.
The elections were scheduled to be held on Dec 31 in the federal capital but the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), in an order earlier in the day, deferred the elections. The decision came days after a bill increasing the number of union councils in Islamabad was passed by parliament.
A large majority of contesting candidates were likely to hold protests against the decision of the Election Commission to postpone the LG elections.
Pattan, a local organisation, claimed that even Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) candidates, whose parties are in power at the Centre, resented their leadership for postponing elections just four days before the day of polling.
According to Pattan, it interviewed at least 25 candidates who belonged to union councils 75, 76, 78, 97 and 101. A majority of these nominees expressed “complete distrust in the election watchdog which failed to abide by its early decision and rules”.

PTI, JI to move court, PML-N, PPP candidates unhappy with postponement

The candidates said they suffered “serious financial damage” as a lot of money had already been spent on the electioneering. The ruling coalition’s nominees said they would record protests with the party leadership and hold protest meetings in reaction to the ECP’s decision. 
A number of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) candidates hinted they would approach courts against the decision as well as hold demonstrations demanding timely elections.
“This is the murder of citizens’ democratic rights and prevalence of poor governance,” a PPP nominee said. A JI candidate said “Islamabad is becoming like Karachi” with respect to the local government elections.
Two PML-N candidates said: “We strongly condemn and oppose the decision of our party because most of the party leaders do not want the local level leadership to reach the provincial and national level.”
A PTI candidate said the “government was afraid of its defeat and they will also sabotage the local government elections in Sindh.”
Some candidates of the PPP termed this decision “anti-democracy” while a few PML-N nominees said their party had called an “emergency meeting and we will decide our course of action”.
A PPP candidate from UC-48 said the “decision has made him very angry” whereas an independent candidate from UC-42 termed it a “bad decision because we had incurred a lot of expenses on the election campaign”.
PTI lashes out at Election Commission
The PTI lashed out at the ECP and accused it of being in cahoots with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government. It said the Islamabad High Court (IHC) would be moved to provide relief to the former ruling party.
It claimed that all surveys and intelligence reports were showing that the PTI was going to give PML-N a good thumping in the polls which prompted the government to postpone polls.
Speaking at a press conference, PTI Secretary General Asad Umar said the decision was not “unexpected because ECP was not functioning as an independent institution”.
“It was not unexpected as Imran Khan is the most popular leader in Pakistan and PTI was going to get the majority seats in polls. We will continue our struggle for the local bodies election,” he added.
He alleged that the reason given for the postponement of the election was irrelevant as PTI had already filed an appeal against the government’s decision to increase the number of union councils.
Mr Umar hoped that his party would get relief from the court and asked party workers to continue their election campaign regarding the Islamabad local polls despite the postponement.
Asad Umar alleged that last week the ECP had announced that it would hold elections in Islamabad but the election watchdog abruptly changed its decision just because the PDM was not ready to contest elections.
He said the residents of Islamabad should have the right to elect their representatives so that an independent local government could be established. Replying to another question, he said efforts were being made by the government to buy the loyalties of MPAs in Punjab.
JI to observe black day
Separately, Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) announced that it would observe a black day today against the postponement of local bodies elections.
JI Naib Emir Mian Mohammad Aslam told reporters that his party would take out rallies on Dec 31 and hold a public referendum on the day of the election. He said the institutions have been acting as “tools of the government” and vowed to challenge the ECP’s decision in the high court.

RAWALPINDI: More than 70 works created by internationally-renowned calligraphers were displayed at the Rawalpindi Arts Council (RAC).
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Qasim Khan Suri inaugurated the exhibition. RAC Director Waqar Ahmad was also present on the occasion.
Works that were exhibited were made by Mohammad Ashraf Heera, Waseem Ashraf, Aslam Dogar and Mohammad Younis Rumi.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Suri said calligraphy was both our great religious and cultural heritage.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to protect and promote it,” he said, adding that calligraphy was the legacy of Muslims.
The tradition of calligraphy was centuries old and our calligraphers were the trustees of this tradition who had kept this art form alive, he said, adding that calligraphy had a prominent and unique place in our civilisation and culture.
“Today’s young people are stepping into the field of painting with a fresh perspective. The arts council is in the true sense, the guardian of the culture of Punjab province and lost crafts, customs and traditions have been taken care of by it,” he said.
He said the government was working hard to improve the working environment for artists, adding that the PTI-led former federal government had done a lot for the promotion of arts and culture.
The arts council director, Waqar Ahmad, said calligraphy was one of the oldest art forms in the world and the council was taking substantial steps to promote it.
Calligraphy classes are a link in this chain, he said, adding that the work of artists was good and it was an effort to promote Islamic culture.
He said the council was the biggest institution for promoting art, culture, literature and performing arts in Punjab.
“The establishment of arts councils in nine divisions and four districts in Punjab shows the importance that the government gives to the promotion of culture in the province,” he added.

The FIR said the FIA office in Hyderabad was also investigating a fake college case, adding that the suspect started to adopt an objectionable attitude towards her and later got her repatriated to her parent department through political influence.
Minister of National Health Services Abdul Qadir Patel then heard her in person and cancelled her repatriation order, the FIR said, adding that he spoke many a time against her character and conduct.
In October, the assistant registrar came to her office and shouted at her in the presence of her junior colleagues and hurled threats at her.

7,CDA may earn Rs20bn from plots’ auction next month,ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) expects that the next month auction of commercial and residential...,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) expects that the next month auction of commercial and residential plots will generate money enough for smoothly executing ongoing mega development project.
The CDA board on Tuesday approved putting 58 commercial and residential plots for auction on Jan 24, 25 and 26 at Jinnah Convention Centre. 
The civic agency is expected to fetch over Rs 20 billion from these three-day auction.
For this auction, the CDA announced incentive for investors as for the first time, time for constructing building has been enhanced for large size of plots. Earlier, there was a three-year time for all size of plots.
However, this time round, the CDA has decided that three year time will be given for construction of building on plots up to 1,000 square yards, four year for 1001 to 3000 sq yard and five-year time will be given for plot from 3001 and above.  
Similarly, the CDA board also decided to give five percent rebate to Overseas Pakistani, who will make payments through foreign remittance/official banking channels with proof within 30 days of the provisional bid acceptance letter.  
“This is in recognition of the remittances that provide a much-needed inflow of dollars to boost foreign exchange reserves,” said a CDA director.
The CDA board, which met here at civic agency’s headquarters with Chairman Mohammad Usman in the chair, approved the auction plan for next month.  
Sources said that out of 58 plots, 12 are residential of Park Enclave I and II. Commercial plots are located in various sectors including Blue Area and sector I-8. This time CDA also decided to auction few plots for schools and hospitals. For the first time, the CDA also decided to put five commercial plots of various sizes located on northern strip of E-11 on auction.
Speaking to Dawn, CDA officials said that this auction is much needed for civic agency as its various mega development projects are in progress that include construction of Margalla Road, Bhara Kahu bypass, Expansion of expressway and IJP road, etc.
The officials said that CDA’s current financial position is alarming. 
During the last few years, various directorates of the CDA without calling tenders spent around Rs20 billion on development works including what many officials say some unnecessary ones.  
Under quotation system, only work wroth Rs500,000 can be carried out that too in highly emergency basis.  However, in CDA a group of few officers illegally got carried out work worth Rs20 billion, by splitting in pieces, through quotations.
Surprisingly, this mega alleged fraud case, could not get attention of Auditor General of Pakistan, as not a single audit para was made in this regard.  
However, a few months ago, the CDA Chairman ordered an inquiry into this mega scam, which has been facing delay in completion.
“Since, we are facing shortage of funds, we are pining high hope on this auction, we are expecting to fetch over 20 billion from it,” said a board member.
