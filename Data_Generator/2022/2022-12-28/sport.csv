0,Gritty Salman cracks maiden ton before  New Zealand respond strongly,"KARACHI: Salman Ali Agha had been showing promise, but he would have known deep down within that a big contribution...","KARACHI: Salman Ali Agha had been showing promise, but he would have known deep down within that a big contribution was due on him. 
It did come, finally, that too in the form of a maiden hundred. And it was good enough for the batter to prove his mettle as a Test material for Pakistan, who piled up a mammoth first-innings total of 438 against New Zealand on the second day of the first Test here at the National Stadium on Tuesday. 
The visitors, however, responded strongly, ending the day at 165 without losing a wicket as openers Tom Latham and Devon Conway neared centuries. 
Salman’s innings was about grit, shrewdness and most importantly bravery. The right-hander was playing at four when he saw captain Babar Azam depart in the day’s first over, without adding to his overnight score of 161. By the end of Pakistan’s innings, Salman had battered the Kiwis’ bowlers for 103 off just 155 balls. 
“Scoring your first international hundred is a feeling you can’t describe in words,” Salman said in the post-day press conference. 
New Zealand would have thought they were on the front foot when their skipper Tim Southee forced Babar into playing a loose drive, only to get caught by wicket-keeper Tom Blundell four deliveries into the day. 
At that point, Salman was just 17-balls-young at the crease, but what followed was a show of maturity and leadership by the batter. He opened his day’s account with a paddle sweep for four off left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel as Nauman Ali looked on from the other end. 
Nauman would go onto spend most of his time on the crease at the non-striker’s end as Salman took all responsibility on his own shoulders. On the rare occasions when he got the chance to bat, the left-hander blocked solidly. 
Salman, meanwhile, kept the attack on as he slashed Southee through backward point for his second boundary before heaving through long-on for a third off Patel. He brought up his half-century with a straight drive for four off Neil Wagner, three deliveries before Nauman fell to the pacer. 
Nauman could add only seven, but he negotiated 75 deliveries. Salman’s contribution to the 54-run partnership was 47 runs off 82 balls. 
Playing only his sixth Test, Salman then combined with Mir Hamza for an eighth-wicket knock of 39 off 48 balls — after Mohammad Wasim depar­ted early — with the tailender playing 15 deliveries for just one run. 
On the other end during the partnership, Salman added 37 off just 33, most of it coming after tea — with Pakistan’s scorecard reading 377-8 at the break. The first delivery of the final session — from Wagner — was dispatched for four by Salman. 
He plundered three more boundaries off the pacer four overs later, after hitting another off Ish Sodhi before Hamza was trapped lbw by the leg-spinner. 
The Lahore-born player lofted Southee over mid-on for his 15th boundary and drilled Sodhi for two more in the next to bring up his hundred. 
“When Babar got out, the responsibility was on me and I looked to score as many runs as possible” said Salman. “I have to appreciate Nomi Bhai [Nauman], he played around 80 balls during a period when staying at the wicket was more important.” 
Pakistan’s dominance with the bat was also due to the National Stadium pitch not responding to spin bowling the way it did on the first day. The nature of the surface didn’t change much when New Zealand came in to bat and the visitors ensured they go into the third day with runs on the board. 
Latham and Conway looked focused and composed as they got themselves settled on the pitch before playing safe shots to get boundaries off pacers as well as spinners. 
Mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed, who was Pakistan’s main strike option during the recent home series against England, was nullified by the two left-handers, who were challenged only by occasional low bounce. 
Pakistan’s attempt to utilise reverse swing through Wasim was also a failure after Hamza, who was playing his first Test in four years, proved ineffective with the new ball. 
Pakistan could have had a breakthrough had they opted for a DRS review after umpire Aleem Dar ruled Conway not out despite inside edging Nauman to wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed’s gloves. Television replays went on to show the batter had clearly edged the ball. 
By the close of play, Latham had scored 78 while Conway had added 82 as they smashed eight and 12 boundaries, respectively. 
The pitch, Sodhi said, would eventually start providing help to the spinners. 
“After watching the first 10 overs of Pakistan’s inn­ings, I thought it’s going to spin a lot more than it has perhaps throughout the day,” he noted. “There are a lot of footmarks down there, specially going around the wic­k­et for me and hopefully we can utilise that as the game progresses but there’s still a job to do with the bat.”

1,Warner retires in pain after smashing double century in 100th Test as SA toil,"Warner, 36, snapped a near-three-year century drought in typically aggressive and gritty fashion.","MELBOURNE: David Warner battled through searing heat to hit an epic unbeaten 200 in his 100th Test on Tuesday before retiring in pain as Australia consolidated their advantage against South Africa here at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
On a scorching day, the hosts were 386-3 at stumps on day two of the second Test, leading by 197 after the Proteas were dismissed in their first innings for 189.
Travis Head was not out 48 with Alex Carey on nine.
Steve Smith (85) and Marnus Labuschagne (14) were the only wickets to fall.
But worryingly for Australia, Cameron Green, who took 5-27 in South Africa’s first innings, also retired hurt after a nasty rap on the finger from Anrich Nortje.
Smith and Warner’s 239-run partnership took the game further away from South Africa, whose bowlers toiled in temperatures touching 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit).
Opener Warner, 36, snapped a near-three-year century drought in typically aggressive and gritty fashion, reaching three figures for a 25th time after coming into the game under pressure on a lean run.
It was his first Test hundred since January 2020 and as the opposition bowlers tired, he battled the elements and converted it to 200 for only the third time.
His wife Candice told host broadcaster Fox: “You’d think by now people would know writing David Warner off is the wrong thing to do.” But it was an exhausting effort, as he passed 8,000 Test runs en route.
Chairs had to be brought out for Warner and Smith to rest on in the drinks breaks, with towels draped over their heads and ice-packs on their shoulders.
Warner needed treatment for cramp several times and retired in pain after reaching 200 and dropping to his knees, eventually helped from the field by support staff.
“The boys were cramping left, right and centre,” Smith told reporters. “So, difficult [conditions] but nice to get us to the position where we are now. I think we’re in a nice spot.”
Australia resumed on 45-1, having lost Usman Khawaja late Monday after taking charge of the opening day, with Green’s heroics helping dismiss the visitors for under 200 again.
They were all out for 152 and 99 in the first Test in Brisbane, which they lost by six wickets inside two days.
Warner began on 32 and showed his aggressive intent with an early boundary off Kagiso Rabada.
Nortje was routinely sending down 150kph (93mph) rockets, smacking Warner on the head when he was on 47. The batter was given the all-clear after a mandatory concussion test on the field, with a lengthy delay as a new helmet was found.
But disaster struck two balls after play resumed.
Warner pushed Nortje for a single and came back for a second, but Labuschagne hesitated and was run out despite a lunging dive.
“It looked like a good wicket in general if you bowled good areas, over time you would get rewarded. But they batted really well,” said Nortje.
“I felt the boys bowled really well... unfortunately it didn’t go our way.”
Warner put his head down to motor to 100, punching the air when he got there after a near-flawless knock characterised by his trademark strong running between the wicket.
Smith was not as comfortable, escaping on nine when he was dropped by wicket-keeper Kyle Verreynne and then on 39 when he was given out caught behind only for it to be called a no-ball.
But he persevered to reach a 37th Test fifty with a four off Marco Jansen.
Warner upped the ante after his century and raced to 200 off 254 balls before calling it quits.
Smith departed shortly before his partner reached the milestone, with Nortje getting his reward for a hard day’s work, with Theunis de Bruyn taking a catch at gully.

2,"Arafat, Basit and Zeeshan included in Test squad for ‘international exposure, experience’","Shahid Afridi, the head of the interim selection committee, says they are eyeing the future.","LAHORE: In an abrupt move that apparently shows indecisiveness, the interim selection committee on Tuesday included three teenaged cricketers namely all-rounder Arafat Minhas, batter Basit Ali and fast bowler Mohammad Zeeshan in the Pakistan Test squad for the ongoing home series against New Zealand in Karachi.
“As part of its strategy and vision to develop, grow and incentivise high-performing talented youngsters, the Men’s Interim Selection Committee has added three top-performers from age-group cricket to the Pakistan Test squad with the objective of providing them international exposure and experience,” stated a PCB press release issued on Tuesday.
Arafat was adjudged best all-rounder of the Pakistan Junior League where he scored 178 runs and took nine wickets for Gwadar Sharks, while Bahawalpur Royals’ Basit was named player and best batter of the PJL after finishing as the top-scorer with 379 runs.
He also featured in the U-19 series against Bangladesh in Multan in November.
Zeeshan, Basit’s team-mate at PJL, was declared the best bowler of the tournament with 14 wickets.
Last Saturday also, the interim selection committee had made three additions to the Test squad, announced for the above-mentioned series by the previous selection committee headed by Mohammad Wasim. The players were pacers Mir Hamza and Shah­nawaz Dahani, and off-spinner Sajid Khan.
However, after just one day, the interim committee excluded two of them — Shahnawaz and Sajid — to let them compete in the ongoingPakistan Cup, which somehow signals the selectors have no clarity in their plan.
Shahid Afridi, the head of the interim selection committee, said they were eyeing the future.
“We are not only looking at the present, but also have an eye on the future. In this relation, we have added three top performers from our age-group cricket so that they can spend time with their stars in the national side and learn how to plan and prepare for high pressure matches,” the former Pakistan captain stated.
“Although the three players will not be available for selection, this initiative will fast track their progress and provide them better awareness, understanding and knowledge about the rigours and demands of top-grade cricket.”

3,England to play white-ball series in Bangladesh,LONDON: England’s preparations to defend their men’s ODI world title next year will include a three-match series...,"LONDON: England’s preparations to defend their men’s ODI world title next year will include a three-match series in Bangladesh in March, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced on Tuesday.
Jos Buttler’s side, who added the world T20 crown this year to the ODI title they won in 2019, will also play three T20 Internationals on the tour.
The matches were originally due to be played in September-October 2021 but were postponed because of pressures related to the Covid-19 pandemic.
England and Bangladesh have both qualified for the 2023 ODI World Cup which takes place in India in October-November, with the full schedule still to be decided.
It will be England’s first visit to Bangladesh since 2016, when they won an ODI series 2-1.
“It is exciting that the England men’s white-ball squad will return to Bangladesh,” said ECB interim chief executive Clare Connor.
“The atmosphere generated in Dhaka and Chittagong for this eag­erly-anticipated tour will be fantastic.
“There is a great passion for cricket across Bangladesh, and we expect a tough challenge against a side who have an excellent record in home conditions.”
The tour will start with the first ODI on March 1 at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka with the second at the same venue two days later. The third will be played at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium in Chittagong on March 6.
Chittagong will then stage the first T20 on March 9 with two further games back in Dhaka on March 12 and 14.

4,Djokovic back in Australia a year after being deported,Djokovic was initially banned from the country for three years after losing a high-stakes legal battle over his vaccine status.,"SYDNEY: Former world number one Novak Djokovic arrived in Australia on Tuesday almost one year after he was deported for refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19, tennis officials said.
The nine-time Australian Open champion was initially banned from the country for three years after losing a high-stakes legal battle in January over his vaccine status.
Australia has since lifted its requirement for visitors to show proof of vaccination against Covid.
The government confirmed in November that the unvaccinated Serb was no longer barred and had been granted a visa allowing him to play in the opening Grand Slam of the year, which starts next month.
Tennis Australia chief executive Craig Tiley said he hoped local fans would embrace Djokovic’s return.
“We welcome him back to Australia,” he told reporters.
“I think as we speak he’s landing in Adelaide and I think that he is going to be again the player to beat.
“I have a great deal of confidence in the Australian public. I have a lot of confidence that the fans will react how we hope they will react.” Tennis Australia confirmed that Djokovic had touched down.
Djokovic, who has won 21 Grand Slams, has been criticised for his part in the saga, which played out as rolling anti-vaccination protests took place in Australia’s major cities.
He is scheduled to play in the Adelaide International, beginning on Sunday, as he warms up for the Open in Melbourne.
“Over the years I’ve been really fortunate to start very strong in Australia and I love playing there,” the world number five said in Dubai last week after ending 2022 with a record-equalling sixth ATP Tour Finals crown.
“After obviously what happened earlier this year, hopefully I can have a decent reception there and hopefully that can help me play some good tennis.”
Djokovic last set foot in Australia nearly a year ago, claiming he had obtained a medical exemption to enter the country without being vaccinated because he had recently recovered from Covid-19.
However, Australian border officials said he did not meet the requirements to be exempted from strict vaccination rules and he was detained for five days while pursuing an ultimately fruitless legal appeal.

The Argentine forward, scored two goals to lead his country to victory over Fra­nce on penalties in the World Cup final nine days ago.
The 35-year-old Messi will miss PSG’s home league game against Strasbourg on Wednesday and the trip to Lens on Sunday.
“He (Messi) had to return to Argentina for the celebrations, and we decided he was going to be off until Jan 1,” Galtier told reporters. “So he will come and join us, eit­her on the 2nd or the 3rd, to be able to resume competition, when he will have had betw­een 13-14 days of recovery.”
Galtier said all other players returned as per the schedule and will be available for Wednesday’s game, including France striker Kylian Mbappe.
Galtier played down suggestions of a rift between Messi and team-mate Mba­p­pe after the World Cup.
“There is no reason to mix everything up in the relationship between Kylian and Leo.  Kylian has a very good attitude having lost the World Cup.”

6,Arsenal stretch lead to seven points as Liverpool make flying start,"LONDON: With Arsene Wenger watching from the stands, Arsenal came from behind to see off West Ham United 3-1 at home...","LONDON: With Arsene Wenger watching from the stands, Arsenal came from behind to see off West Ham United 3-1 at home on Monday and move seven points clear at the top of the Premier League while Liverpool got back up and running with a 3-1 victory at Aston  Villa with teenager Stefan Bajcetic joining Mohamed Salah and Virgil van  Dijk on the scoresheet.
Wenger was back at the Emirates Stadium for the first time since leaving the club in 2018 after 22 years in charge and saw Bukayo Saka, Gab­riel Martinelli and Eddie Nketiah score in a rousing second-half comeback after a Said Benr­ahma penalty had given West Ham the lead.
The victory maintained Arsenal’s 100% home record in the league this season and lifted them to 40 points from 15 games, seven clear of second-placed Newcastle United, who have played 16 matches. They are eight ahead of third-placed Manchester City, who have played 14.
Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said he was pleased Wenger was able to return and witness such a convincing comeback.
“He picked the right moment. I thought the performance today was at the level he deserved,” said the manager. “We  showed a lot of composure and quality. We didn’t start to play the game  they wanted to play, we kept pushing, believing and deserved the win.” 
Benrahma sent Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale the wrong way from the spot to put West Ham in front in the 27th minute after a foul by William Saliba on Jarrod Bowen.West Ham, who have not won away in the league since August, had done well to keep Mikel Arteta’s side largely out of the area in the first half but their defence gave way once Arsenal found their groove after the break.
The hosts were awarded a spot-kick at the end of the first half for handball against Aaron Creswell before referee Michael Oliver overturned his decision after a VAR review, ruling that the ball had struck the defender in the face.
Saka equalised from close range in the 53rd minute while Martinelli smashed the ball inside the near post six minutes later to put Arsenal in front.
Striker Nketiah, making his first league start of the season in the place of injured Gabriel Jesus, added a third in the 69th and Arsenal kept pushing to score again.
Watkins had the ball in the net within three minutes of the restart  but had just strayed offside before firing into the far corner.
Meanwhile, Jurgen Klopp’s men had to endure some nervy moments in the second half  after Ollie Watkins pulled a goal back for Villa before teenager Bajcetic came off the bench to secure the three points with his first  senior goal.
Liverpool struggled to match their standards of recent seasons during  the first part of the season, but looked refreshed to inflict Unai  Emery’s first league defeat since taking charge of Villa.
Salah is  one of a number of Klopp’s key players who was not involved in Qatar  and took just five minutes to net his 15th goal of the season.
The Egyptian swept home Andy Roberson’s pass after Trent Alexander-Arnold’s through ball had opened up the Villa defence.
Emery’s  men were left to rue a host of big chances to get immediately back on  level terms as Liverpool showed no sign of remedying their defensive  issues so far this season.
John  McGinn also fluffed his lines with just goalkeeper Alisson Becker to beat  before the home side got the goal their start to the second half  deserve.

KARACHI: Central Punjab sealed their spot in the Pakistan Cup semi-finals after thrashed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa by 113 runs here at the National Bank Sports Complex on Tuesday.
The remaining three spots for semis are still up for grabs with the final round of matches of the league stage to be played on Thursday.
The defeat against Central Punjab left Khyber Pakhtunkhwa third in the Cup standings, equal on points with Balochistan, who were second after beating Northern by 110 runs at the UBL Sports Complex.
Northern and Sindh, who fell to Southern Punjab by four wickets, are equal on points with eight but the latter is placed fourth, right above the former.
Central Punjab’s convincing victory was down to Usama Mir’s all-round show. After Ahmed Shehzad (71 off 91 balls, nine fours) and Qasim Akram (58 off 62 balls, five fours and a six) lead the side to 315-8, Usama Mir took five wickets, giving away only 45 runs to bowl Khyber Pakhtunkhwa out for 202 with more than 10 overs to spare. 
For the former champions, Iftikhar Ahmed’s 66 and Fakhar Zaman’s 52 were the best contributions with the bat. Usama had earlier scored a 15-ball cameo for 29 with the help of a boundary and three sixes.
Balochistan’s victory, too, was boosted by a big first-innings score. The defending champions posted 387-7 before bowling out Northern for 277.
Haris Sohail slapped six fours and four sixes in a 61-ball 92 while Abdul Wahid Bangalzai scored a 70-ball 88 with six fours and five sixes, Imran Butt struck 11 fours in his 83 and Haseebullah smashed 59 off 55 to put Balochistan in a strong position.
Northern failed to maintain the required run-rate of 7.76 and eventually collapsed in 47.3 overs despite half-centuries by Umair Masood (51) and Umar Akmal (51). Kashif Bhatti was the pick of Balochistan bowlers with 4-48, while Amad Butt and Mohammad Junaid took two wickets apiece.
Southern Punjab faced little challenge in disposing off Sindh. Batting first, Sindh were dismissed for 171 in 47.2 overs with Mohammad Suleman (62) and Danish Aziz (36) being their notable scorers.
Southern Punjab opener Mohammad Shehzad led their run-chase, belting five fours and four sixes in his 96-ball knock for 85, assisting his team in crossing the finish line with nearly 15 overs and four wickets to spare.
Summarised scores:
Southern Punjab beat Sindh by four wickets at State Bank Stadium 
SINDH 171 in 47.2 overs (Mohammad Suleman 62, Danish Aziz 36; Mohammad Ilyas 2-18); SOUTHERN PUNJAB 172-6 in 35.1 overs (Mohammad Shehzad 85, Usman Salahuddin 34; Shahnawaz Dahani 3-66)

9,Andoo Comanche on course for victory in Sydney-Hobart race,SYDNEY: Australian supermaxi Andoo Comanche was barrelling towards a line honours victory in the Sydney-Hobart yacht...,"SYDNEY: Australian supermaxi Andoo Comanche was barrelling towards a line honours victory in the Sydney-Hobart yacht race Tuesday, but its hopes of smashing the course record have faded.
The boat, skippered by owner John Winning, pulled clear of its competitors in fast downwind conditions in the blue water classic.
Andoo Comanche was more than 20 nautical miles ahead of second-placed LawConnect on Tuesday evening, 30 hours after the 109-strong fleet set sail from Sydney Harbour.
Just seven nautical miles separated the other 100-foot supermaxis — LawConnect, Black Jack and Wild Oats — in a tight scramble for second place.
With less than 100 nautical miles remaining, Andoo Comanche was poised to reach the Tasmanian sta­te capital late on Tuesday evening.
“We always think we’re going to be the best boat out there and do as well as we can,” Winning said ahead of the race. “We’ll just try and outsail the others and win it on that.”
The gruelling Sydney-Hobart course has been a happy hunting ground for the Comanche boat, which set the current race record under a different skipper in 2017.
Favourable weather early in the race raised the prospect of toppling that mark, which sits at one day, 9 hours, 15min and 24sec.
While north-to-northeasterly gusts pushed the fleet quickly through treacherous Bass Strait, it was unlikely to be enough for any boat to go under the best time for the 628-nautical mile event.
Although there are only four yachts in the supermaxi class this year, the competition for line honours is fierce.
Black Jack is the defending champion, and Wild Oats is a perennial favourite that has won the race nine times.
While the supermaxis can hit high downwind speeds, they must balance it with the need to avoid breakages and sail damage.
Bass Strait, which separates Tasmania from the mainland, can unleash perilous conditions.
A deep depression proved catastrophic for the fleet in 1998, when six sailors were killed and 55 more were rescued after five boats sank.
Depending on weather patterns, it will likely take about two to three more days for the smaller boats in the fleet to finish.
Race officials said only three of the original starting line-up had been forced to retire to date.
One of them, 40-foot yacht Yeah Baby, was forced to withdraw less than four hours into the race after reportedly colliding with a sunfish.
Overseas entrants come from Germany (Orione), Hong Kong (Antipodes), Hungary (Cassiopeia 68), New Caledonia (Eye Candy and Poulpito), New Zealand (Caro), Britain (Sunrise) and the United States (Warrior Won).
However, it was another Australian boat, Chutzpah, that was best placed to win the race handicap prize, which takes into account the yachts’ sizes.

13,"Quitting Juventus top job wasn’t easy, says Agnelli",TURIN: Outgoing Juventus Chair­man Andrea Agnelli on Tuesday defended his tenure at the helm of the Serie A club ...,"TURIN: Outgoing Juventus Chair­man Andrea Agnelli on Tuesday defended his tenure at the helm of the Serie A club and said the decision to step down had been a hard one to take.
“On top of loving Juventus, in recent years I have given my best to achieving results on and off the pitch,” Agnelli told shareholders gathered in Turin’s Juventus Stadium.
Investors approved results for the fiscal year ended in June which showed a 238 million euro ($255 million) loss.
Juventus, Italy’s most successful team, is under scrutiny by prosecutors and the country’s market watchdog for alleged false accounting, leading its board to resign last month.
Prosecutors have requested Agnelli, 11 other people and the club itself stand trial.
Agnelli, a member of the family which controls Juventus and the team’s chairman for over a decade, said that by stepping down he had wanted to avoid any risk that people might think his personal situation could affect the club’s decisions.
“Juventus comes before everything and everyone,” he said.  “I am strongly convinced I have acted properly in recent years, and that accusations raised against us were not founded.”
Italy’s football prosecutors last week sought the partial cancellation of a ruling that cleared Juventus and other clubs and their executives following the accounting investigation focused on capital gains.
A hearing on the case is scheduled  on Jan 20  , Juventus CEO Maurizio Arrivabene said on Tuesday.
On Monday Exor — led by the scion of the Agnelli family John Elkann and the largest investor in Juventus with around 64% of shares and 78% of voting rights — presented its slate for the club’s new board, which 
will be appointed at a shareholder meeting on Jan 18.
It includes accountant Gianluca Ferrero for the role of chairman and Maurizio Scanavino for CEO. Scanavino is the CEO of publisher GEDI, also controlled by Exor, and was recently appointed as Juventus general manager.
The new board, made up of accounting, auditing and legal professionals, will shrink to five members from 10 previously.
