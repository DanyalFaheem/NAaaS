0,"In a first, KPC panel returns unopposed",KARACHI: There will be no polling for the annual election of the Karachi Press Club this year after all candidates ...,"KARACHI: There will be no polling for the annual election of the Karachi Press Club this year after all candidates of The Democrats returned unopposed for the year 2023 on Tuesday.
According to the KPC, Saeed Sarbazi of Business Recorder and Shoaib Ahmed of News One have been elected unopposed president and secretary, respectively.
Mushtaq Sohail of Daily Kawish has been elected Vice President, Muhammad Aslam Khan of Samaa News Joint Secretary and Ehtisham Saeed Qureshi of Daily Ummat as Treasurer. Kulsoom Jahan, Farooq Sami, Rameez Vohra, Rafique Bashir, Shams Keerio, Zulfiqar Ali Rajper and Zulfiqar Ali Wahoocho elected as members of the Governing Body. 
They were elected unopposed after all opposing groups and members withdrew their nomination papers the day the panels were to be announced. 
It is said to be the first time ever that an entire KPC panel has been elected unopposed. 
Senior journalist Ghazi Salahuddin was the last president of KPC to have been elected unopposed (although his entire panel went through the election process). 
Speaking to Dawn on Tuesday, he said: “There is an entire panel coming unopposed which has two aspects to it,” he said. “The positive aspect is that there will be no bitterness during the elections because there will be no elections. But the other aspect is that the Press Club is for journalists and there is always room for difference of opinion in journalism. So I would have welcomed the elections at KPC. You also need to accept dissent or deal with descent in journalism,” he concluded. 
Former KPC president Mazhar Abbas said an entire panel coming in unopposed shows the people’s confidence in that panel but it also points to some trouble among the opposing groups.
“The KPC elections have always brought up a healthy competition. Getting elected unopposed here should not become a new tradition, hopefully. It is also true that not all the KPC members or KPC voters visit the club often. They are approached by the candidates and their groups to request for votes, which involve them in the process, too,” he pointed out. 
“Still, even though there are going to be no elections on this year’s last Saturday like there used to be every year, I would like to see members attending the general body meeting to discuss the affairs of the Club that still need attention,” he said.

KARACHI: A young man was shot dead by police after a chase as he allegedly refused to stop his motorbike during snap-checking and tried to speed away in Gulistan-i-Jauhar on Tuesday, officials and hospital sources said.
The manner with which two policemen of Shaheen Force shot the man twice not on any road but inside an apartment complex cast doubts over their side of story and put a big question mark over their training.
The incident sparked a public outcry on social media that prompted Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to take notice of it. 
DIG-East Muquddus Haider told Dawn that an inquiry conducted by senior police officers proved that the “policemen killed an innocent person”. 
He added that three policemen were arrested on charges of killing the citizen. An FIR under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code was being registered against them. 
Earlier, SSP-East Syed Abdul Rahim Shirazi told Dawn that three policemen of Shaheen Force, which was recently formed to counter street criminals in the city, were arrested for shooting to death 26-year-old Amir Hussain.
In their initial statement, the held policemen said they signalled the motorcyclist to stop during snap-checking. He did not stop upon which they chased him, started firing that led to his death, the SSP said.
The victim is said to be a son of an official of the Sindh excise department.
His relatives told the media that the policemen chased Amir and shot him on the stairs of Noman Avenue, a multi-storey apartment complex, in Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Block-20. He suffered critical bullet wounds and was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival. 
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said that the man suffered two firearm injuries in the chest and foot. 
She said both bullets stuck in the body and were retrieved by doctors during a post-mortem examination. The same had been handed over to police for further investigation, she said.
Meanwhile, Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and directed the Karachi police chief to submit a detailed report about the incident.
Robbers shoot man over resistance
A citizen was shot and wounded by two armed robbers when he put up resistance in North Karachi, police said on Tuesday.

4,"PTI, JI ask ECP to hold LG polls on time",KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Jamaat-i-Islami called upon the Election Commission of Pakistan to fulfil...,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Jamaat-i-Islami called upon the Election Commission of Pakistan to fulfil its constitutional responsibility by holding local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad on time.
Both the parties expressed their expectations from the ECP at their separate press conferences here on Tuesday. 
Speaking at a press conference,  former federal minister and PTI-Sindh president Ali  Zaidi said that the PTI would resist any move from the  ruling parties and would make every effort using all legal and  democratic forums for timely elections.
“Like other parts of the  country, chairman Imran Khan is also clear about this and confident that  this bandit rule in Sindh should end,” he said. “And for that, the PTI  Sindh is going to be a major force for a massive movement going on true  freedom. 
“These bandits know the that they can’t hold any ground if the  fair and free elections are held. So they are running away from the  elections. But we wouldn’t let them get away with that.”
He said that the PPP did not want to lose Karachi from its provincial administration’s  control mainly for the financial reasons.
“Years of bad  governance, corruption and violation of law are on PPP’s credit.  They have nothing to win votes in Karachi and today they have conceded  defeat. The people of Karachi wouldn’t forgive the PPP and we expect the  ECP that it would fulfill its responsibility for free, fair and timely  LG polls,” added Mr Zaidi.
Recalling former prime  minister Benazir Bhutto on his 15th death anniversary, he said that she  would have been deeply disappointed seeing the current state of affairs  at her party which had been “hijacked by his husband Asif Ali Zardari  for exploitation and vested interests”.
JI urges CJP to take suo motu notice
The Jamaat-i-Islami on Tuesday appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan to take suo motu notice of the “unconstitutional measures” on part of the PPP and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan against the local government elections in Karachi. 
Speaking at a press conference here, JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman spoke at length about the upcoming local government elections and demanded that the Election Commission of Pakistan hold the LG polls as per the announced schedule on Jan 15, 2023. 
He called it anti-democratic attempt being made by the Sindh government to resuscitate the dead political horses in the country. 
He said the PPP had written a letter to the ECP against holding the polls in the city for the fourth time. This time, he maintained, the PPP was using the pretext of a demand made by the MQM-P for fresh delimitation of union committees in the city. 
“The PPP has been ruling the province for over 14 years and the MQM is fully cooperating with the PPP. The two parties could have opted for delimitation, reforms or whatever they name, but they didn’t and now they are using every possible excuse to get rid of the local government elections in Karachi,” he added.

5,Call to expand SC law clerkship programme to high courts,"Legal experts say practice can help to expedite disposal of cases, groom young lawyers.","KARACHI: Lauding the Supreme Court law clerkship programme, legal experts have suggested that such practice may also be adopted at high courts and subordinate judiciary of the country to expedite disposal of cases and professional grooming of young lawyers.  
They are of the view that the country’s judiciary has been overburdened and it is humanly not possible for judges to go through the files of all cases fixed before them on daily basis and the assistance of law clerks will be very useful to speed up the trial and proceedings.  
The concept of law clerkship has already been recognised and practised across the globe and has not only been constructive for capacity building of young lawyers and fresh law graduates, but also supportive for judges in timely disposal of the cases, the experts maintained.  
A law clerk, also called judicial law clerk or judicial associate, is a lawyer usually a fresh law graduate who provides direct assistance to a judge.  

Interns provide direct assistance to apex court judges and play helpful role in speedy disposal of cases

The law clerkship programme can be traced back to 1882, when the first law clerk was appointed at the US Supreme Court and the practice was later adopted by other countries, including the UK, Australia, Singapore, Mexico, and South Korea.  
In Pakistan, this practice was introduced at the apex court in 2010 by the then judge of Supreme Court Justice Jawwad S. Khawaja, who later became the chief justice of Pakistan, and now this programme is in its 12th year providing opportunity for over a hundred young lawyers to work on complex and historic cases before the apex court and learn from the guidance of their respective judges and go on to excel.  
Recently, the law clerkship program has also been introduced at the Islamabad High Court (IHC).  
In May, the IHC had invited applications from eligible candidates for the position of law clerk on one year contract basis to primarily conduct legal and academic research.  
Haider Imam Rizvi, a member of judicial commission of Pakistan and former vice chairman of the Sindh Bar Council, said, “We are in a midst of an era when the law is rapidly evolving and required to be developed in a right path while the courts are overburdened with cases and pending decisions.”  
While appreciating the initiative of the IHC to start the law clerkship programme in line with the apex court, he maintained that currently, the burden of cases on courts was far beyond the strength of judges as a judge could not be humanly expected to go through all the cases fixed in a day, thus research on the same with the assistance of law clerks would be very useful to pass judgments in a nick of time as every litigant seeking quick decision.  
Therefore, he suggested that the law clerkship might also be introduced to other high courts and sessions judges of the country so the process of justice can be expedited.  
He was of the view that this concept had already been in place in many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, the Philippines, Ireland, Singapore and India.  
Mr Rizvi further said that in 2018, when he was the president of the Karachi Bar Association, he gave a proposal to the chief justice of the Sindh High Court to introduce such a programme at the SHC. However, it could not be materialised, he added.  
He recommended that funds to pay stipend to such law interns could be generated by a pool in a separate account from the amount of costs being imposed by the judges in case of adjournments and frivolous litigation while donations could also be additional source of funds from lawyers and bar associations.  
The incumbent vice chairman of SBC Zulfiqar Ali Jalbani said that the programme might also be extended to the high courts, Federal Shariat Court, tribunals, special courts and subordinate judiciary of the country.  
“This will not only support the professionalism and performance as well as capacity building of young lawyers, but also be very helpful for the overburdened judiciary for speedy disposal of cases and to clear the huge backlog,” he added.  
He stated that this concept had been in place in several other countries since long and highly useful for their judicial system.  
A spokesman for the apex court told Dawn that law clerkship programme had been in place at the apex court since 2010 and the Supreme Court had been inviting applications for law clerkship programme almost every year across the country and the period of this internship was one year, which was extendable.  
According a statement of apex court, today most supreme courts across the world employ some version of a law clerkship programme, whereby exceptionally talented recent law graduates are employed to work directly with the judges of the supreme courts. The practice has grown over the centuries since its inception and today, former law clerks make up the majority of sitting Supreme Court Justices in the US.  
This year apex court has received the highest number of applications for its law clerkship programme since its inception as over 850 young lawyers applied across the country for 11 positions, it added.  
Forty six of them were shortlisted on the basis of merit and they were interviewed by two judges of apex court and eventually, 11 candidates were finalised while five were kept on reserve list since additional law clerks may be required by the apex court from time to time.

6,SHC sets aside life term of man in murder case,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has overturned a life imprisonment handed down to a man in a case pertaining to the...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has overturned a life imprisonment handed down to a man in a case pertaining to the murder of his neighbour.  
The SHC observed that the wife of an appellant, Qurat-ul-Ain, who had became an approver and deposed against her husband before the trial court, was a dishonest witness and should not have been treated as an approver since her testimony was inadmissible evidence.  
A sessions court had sentenced Mehboob Ali alias Bobby to life in prison in February 2015 for killing his neighbour Aliya during a robbery at her house in a Nazimabad locality in November 2009.  
The prosecution said that husband of the victim, Naveed Qureshi, came to know through the newspaper that an unidentified body of a woman had been found in the Nazimabad area in a gunny bag and identified the same as the dead body of his wife Aliya.  
The convict through his counsel had filed an appeal against his conviction.  
After hearing arguments and examining record and proceedings, the single-judge bench of SHC headed by Justice Omar Sial allowed the appeal and exonerated the appellant.  
The bench in its order observed that Qurat-ul-Ain was arrested around five months after the incident and a couple of days later things took a turn when the woman had recorded what was termed as a “confession statement” before a magistrate.  
“The entire case hinges on the fact that Qurat-ul Ain, who was Mehboob’s accomplice in the crime, made a confession, was tendered pardon, made an approver, recorded her testimony at trial and whatever she said was used to convict and sentence Mehboob,” it added.  
The bench further said the prosecution alleged that jewellery stolen from the victim was also recovered on a lead provided by the appellant, but the recovery was doubtful as the story narrated by Qurat-ul-Ain as to how victim’s jewellery reached Mehboob did not sound realistic while the deceased’s husband could not realise till five months that jewellery had been taken off was odd in itself.  
It also questioned that whether Qurat-ul-Ain statement recorded under Section 164 of the criminal procedure code could be termed a confession as she did not make an admission of guilt, but has taken the plea that she herself was a victim of the appellant’s aggression and cruelty and not once did she say that she had aided, abetted or helped Mehboob in any manner whatsoever.  
An approver is always an accomplice and an accomplice is a person who knowingly, voluntarily, and intentionally unites with the principal offender in committing a crime while an accused can only be pardoned if the legal heirs of the victim give their consent, it added.  
The bench further said that apparently district public prosecutor as well as the learned trial court judge erred in approving the tender of pardon to Qurat-ul-Ain as DPP in his capacity as in-charge of the prosecution in the district tendered the pardon to Qurat-ul-Ain.  
The procedure followed to give her a tender of pardon was flawed, recovery of the jewellery was highly doubtful and the place of incident and the identity of the dead body also remained suspicious, it concluded.  
During the arguments, the lawyer for the appellant claimed that Mehboob was innocent and in fact after death of Aliya, Qurat-ul-Ain had married Naveed Qureshi, complainant and husband of deceased, and it was the bait given to her by the complainant to falsely implicate her own husband.

Chairing a meeting of his party’s central committee here on Tuesday, STP chairman Dr Qadir Magsi said that economic conditions in the country were worsening but the ruling and opposition parties were busy in leg pulling in the parliament. The masses were unable to have two squares meal a day, he added. 
He deplored that since the inception of Pakistan to date, experiments were being done here. Successive dictatorial regimes, establishment, sponsored civilian governments and so called democratic governments have pushed the country backward. Racialism and racialist forces were being promoted deliberately and religious extremism is gaining grounds. On the other hand, he said, the country’s wealth was being looted to fill personal accounts and make the country economically bankrupt.
He said that the entire country was facing instability and uncertainty for which rulers were squarely responsible. They had brought this country to the verge of economic collapse, he noted.
The STP chief said that Sindh was also badly affected under the prevailing conditions because outsiders were being settled here under a planned manner.
He regretted that Sindh’s lands were being given away to builders in the name of mega housing projects to bring in and settle outsiders. The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) is playing a dominant role in this regard, according to him. He alleged that the PPP government was bargaining over collective rights of Sindh in lieu of its lust for powers.
Dr Magsi said that until and unless federation of Pakistan was reconstituted to make it a people’s republic to ensure parity among all federating units, the country would not become strong, rather it would keep facing crises. He said that the establishment must act responsibly.
He said that Sindh was also facing geographical threats due to the present conditions confronting the country. He said people of Sindh would have to demonstrate awareness. “They would not withdraw from an inch of their province and would even lay down their lives to protect its territory,” he said. 
The STP chief said that all friendly and nationalist forces of Sindh would have to give up their personal differences to forge unity. He urged them to form a united forum on the parliamentary front to defeat Sindh’s ‘jagirdars and waderas’ (feudal lords). He said the STP was already waging a struggle in this regard.
Jam Abdul Fatah Samejo, Gulzar Soomro, Hyder Mallah and Hyder Shahani were among those who attended the meeting.

12,Dead Indus dolphin found floating in Dadu Canal,"DADU: A carcass of endangered Indus Blind Dolphin was found in Dadu Canal near airport area, about six kilometers...","DADU: A carcass of endangered Indus Blind Dolphin was found in Dadu Canal near airport area, about six kilometers from main Sukkur barrage, on Tuesday. 
The area people took out the carcass from the canal and handed it over to officials of the wildlife department, who shifted it to conservation centre for the Indus Blind Dolphins in Sukkur.  
The officials said the carcass of the female mammal was four feet and three inches long and it must be around five year of age. The mammal was at great risk due to drop in water level in the Indus river, they said, adding no mark of injury was found on the carcass, still investigation was under way to find real cause of her death.  
”The dolphins move in river creeks frequently during flood season in search of prey and get trapped after reduction in water level, hence they often get entangled in fishing nets or stranded into canals and distributaries and meet their eventual death,” said Sukkur region’s deputy conservator Adnan Hamid Khan. 
He said that locals considered the mammal dangerous and often attacked it with sticks and guns. The department had taken legal action against such people, he said.   
“Dolphins have almost gone extinct due to shortage of water between Sukkur and Kotri reach and the few that remained live at greater peril to their lives,” said Dr Ali Asghar Mahesar, an environmentalist.  
World Bank’s senior environmental specialist, Takeaki Sato, urged the Sindh wildlife department to conduct at least one survey on dolphins in a year. The WB had started work on the conservation of the endangered species by releasing funds to the department, he said.  
Ghulam Mohiuddin Mughal, project director of Sindh Barrages Improvement Project, said that WB had approved Rs196.5 million for the rescue and population survey of dolphins. 
Imran Aziz Tunio, water resources expert, said that the water deficit between Guddu and Sukkur and Sukkur and Kotri reaches was killing the dolphins. The Indus River System Authority, therefore, should release minimal environment flows for the survival of the mammal, else, the indigenous species would disappear, he warned.

13,Jiyalas brave severe cold amid threat alert to throng Garhi Khuda Bukhsh,"Organisers, police maintain discipline, take due care of Benazir’s death anniversary participants","LARKANA: Garhi Khuda Bukhsh Bhutto, the venue where Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto’s death anniversary is held since her assassination in 2007, reverberated with slogans of Jeay Bhutto and Jeay Banazir with jiyalas dancing to the tunes of thrilling party songs like Bijan Teer Bijan playing on sound systems all along the route to the Bhuttos’ mausoleum as dawn broke on Tuesday.
Caravans of jiyalas started arriving in the pindal on foot after passing through walkthrough gates and happily offering frisking to police personnel and PPP’s security squad. None of the several hundred thousand participants appeared fearful or panicked although the country has been facing a fresh wave of terrorism and a threat alert also been issued by the United States and Britain for their citizens specifying that public places and large gatherings may be the target of terrorists.  
Even a senior PPP leader in his speech referred to the wave of terrorism and asked the party leadership to get the masses rid of terrorism. 
The party’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa president Mr Najmuddin recalled that Benazir Bhutto had visited Swat when a similar wave of terrorism had gripped the area. She established her government’s writ and hoisted Pakistan flag there. Later, Asif Ali Zardari also unfurled Pakistani flag in Swat declaring that peace had returned to the entire province, he said. “Now the situation is upside down as no one feels secure,” he said, and blamed the PTI-led government in KPK for the situation. 

Organisers, police maintain discipline, take due care of Benazir’s death anniversary participants

Sindh police had made arrangements for foolproof security during the event attended by PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and a host of senior PPP leaders coming from across the country, beside the huge number of party workers and supporters who included many women and children.  
Sindh Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon himself supervised the security arrangements. 
The Mazar Committee and district administration had jointly made arrangements to provide all essential facilities to the participants.
Tents were pitched for PPP’s divisional chapter leaders. 
Since morning, PPP leaders, including Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, his cabinet colleagues and their counterparts from other provinces, kept visiting the mausoleum to lay wreaths on Bhuttos’ graves and offer fateha. 
The jiyalas wearing party badges, caps, mufflers were carrying a waving party flags and Bhuttos’ portraits while raising slogans. 
Elaborate arrangements were made to ensure a smooth flow of vehicular traffic while medical camps were set up to provide emergency health cover to the participants. A vast area on the left side of the mausoleum was spared for parking of vehicles. 
All speakers at the anniversary programme renewed their pledge to carry forward the mission of Benazir Bhutto. A mushaira was also a key feature of the event.
PPP Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro paid homage to Benazir Bhutto for her sustained struggle for the restoration of democracy in the country and finally laying down her life for the cause. He also lauded the struggle by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and other PPP leaders for democracy and people’s rights.
PPP AJK president Chaudhri Yaseen said Asif Ali Zardari, after Benazir Bhutto, advocated the cause of Kashmir. He said leaders of no other party had taken such a strong stand. 
PPP’s parliamentary party leader in the Punjab Assembly and general secretary PPP Southern Punjab said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was serving as a bridge to continue the services rendered by Benazir Bhutto. “Now Punjab is facing peculiar situation but jiyals stand with Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari,” he said. 
On the occasion senior renowned photographer Zahid Hussain’s book, Baby Say Bibi Tak, was jointly launched by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Sanam Bhutto and Bibi Aseefa Bhutto.

The minister said after inaugurating Sukkur Arts Council at Sukkur Cultural Complex congratulated the participants and said that it was his dream to build a cultural arts council on the pattern of Karachi Arts Council in Sukkur.
He said that several cultural complexes were under-construction in different cities whose work had been suspended due to issues of funds availability but now he would make efforts to complete the construction of the buildings soon.
He said that an arts council should be built at division level to promote all languages because whoever lived in Sindh was Sindhi. Ideology of extremism and bigotry could be defeated through the construction of arts councils, said the minister.
