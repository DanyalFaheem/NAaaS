0,Magistrate orders IO to produce Dua Zehra in court on Aug 1,SHC issues notices on Zaheer’s plea for protection.,"KARACHI: A court on Friday directed the investigating officer to produce teenage Dua Zehra from the Darul Aman in Lahore, where she took shelter.
On July 19, a judicial magistrate in Lahore had sent the teenage girl to a shelter home on her request after a fresh investigation had revealed that Zaheer Ahmed had allegedly kidnapped her from Karachi and later illegally solemnised child marriage with her in Punjab.
On Friday, the girl’s mother, Saima Kazmi, moved an application before Judicial Magistrate (East) Aftab Ahmed Bughio pleading to order the police to recover her minor daughter from the Lahore’s shelter home and put under the protection of any child protection institute.
While allowing the application, the judge directed the IO to produce the girl duly accompanied by a child protection officer on Aug 1 “without fail”.

SHC issues notices on Zaheer’s plea for protection

The IO was also told to submit a final charge sheet on the next date so that the matter pertaining to her alleged abduction and underage marriage could be proceeded accordingly.
“It is very much clear that in the case when confidential information is brought by any person acting in benefit of the minor that an offence with regard to the Child Marriage Restraint Act is committed, the court has to ensure her or his production for protecting her/him from being victimised,” the order said.
The magistrate mentioned that the Sindh High Court had in this regard clearly issued directions to the IO for shifting the victim/witness from Lahore to Karachi and the production of the minor before the court for further orders for custody and protection of minor/victim and disposal of the case.
Earlier, the applicant’s counsel argued that under Rule 9 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Rules, 2016 the incumbent court having jurisdiction of the police station where the minor’s kidnapping was reported on the application of a person, who is acting in the interest of the child, may pass an order for production of the minor in case where it appears to the court that the offence under the Child Marriage Protection Act, 2013 is committed or is likely to be committed.
He pleaded the court to issue the writ for production of the victim/minor Dua Zehra under this Rule.
The counsel claimed that strange people were seeking permission to meet Dua in Darul Aman at Lahore, which, he apprehended, may prejudice and create the possibility of her being pressurised.
Notices issued on Zaheer’s plea for protection
The Sindh High Court on Friday issued notices to the federal interior and finance secretaries, provincial home secretary, police and other respondents on petitions of Zaheer Ahmed and his brother seeking protection and unfreezing of their bank accounts.
Zaheer Ahmed, the alleged husband of Dua Zehra, through his lawyer petitioned the SHC stating that he had contracted free-will marriage with Dua on April 17 but he had recently been nominated as an accused in a supplementary statement by Syed Mehdi Ali Kazmi, father of Dua and complainant of the case, since she tied the knot without consent of her parents.
He stated that Mr Kazmi and his relatives had developed severe grudge and enmity and trying to break the scared marriage. Dua had given several statements before the courts as well as police about her free-will marriage and also refused to go to Karachi due to threat to her life, he added.
He alleged that during re-investigation of the case, police booked the petitioner due to “political and sectarian influence as the petitioner and complainant belong to two different sects”.
The counsel further stated that police were trying to affect arrest of the petitioner and adamant to “kill him in a fake encounter at the behest of local political interference” while the petitioner was ready to face the trial before relevant court.
The petitioner sought directives for respondents not to arrest him unlawfully as he was on interim pre-arrest bail and to provide safety and protection to him from the complainant of the case.
After preliminary hearing, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro issued notices to the respondents as well as federal and provincial law officers for July 29.

1,In mint condition,Works of 18 emerging artists on display,"KARACHI: In the last few decades, arguably, the fearless manner in which fine art has flourished and progressed in Pakistan no other form of expression has — not even poetry or fiction. One knows that it’s a tall claim. The fact of the matter is anyone who has been to art displays in the 21st century, especially in Karachi, they would realise that the courage that the artists have shown in picking their subjects — from bigotry to politicians’ venality to spiritual quests — is astounding. 
There is new-found confidence in the art community, which allows them to be intrepid, playful or experimental whenever they feel like it — sometimes all three at the same time. A recent example is a group show interestingly titled Fresh Mint that can be seen at the Full Circle Gallery. 
To get the hang of the exhibition, and understand the crux of the minty name, its curator Irfan Gul Dahri’s following statement might help: “The ways of creative expression are infinite. By the time a visual settles in a viewer’s mind, it includes the references of its ancient origin, the vibrancy of various cultures, the critique of thinkers, the pain of its maker, and a moment of the viewer’s own life. 
“Such combinations can never be exactly the same, yet the ‘new’ may just be a variation of something that existed before. And that is precisely the beauty of it all… Fresh Mint is the new harvest of such ideas by 18 exceptional emerging artists,” it said. 

Works of 18 emerging artists on display

One can infer that the reference here is to the phrase, ‘a breath of fresh air’. These artists are indeed exceptional not only in terms of the content that they have chosen to focus on but their versatility of technique is no less impressive. Yes, they are emerging, so along the way in their creative journeys they are going to learn a lot more. 
The artists taking part in the exhibition are: Abbas Ali, Alizeh Ijaz, Ameema Saleem, Amerzish Khalid, Arfa Shan, Fizza Aslam, Hadiqa Asad, Hafsa Jamshed, Hamza Bin Faisal, Hifza Khan, Javaid Joya, Khadija Tariq, Maria Aamir, Nabiha Gillani, Ramsha Haider, Riaz Ali, Rizwan Channa and Sajjad Roy. 
The exhibition will conclude on July 28.

2,400 people die of stroke daily in Pakistan: experts,"‘Hypertension, diabetes, tobacco consumption are main risk factors’","KARACHI: Expressing concern over the growing number of stroke cases in Pakistan, experts at a press conference held on Thursday stated that the situation in the country was so worrisome that the government should immediately initiate a national health programme for stroke prevention and set up facilities at all tertiary care hospitals for its care and management. 
The event was organised in connection with World Brain Day, which is observed every year on July 22. 
The theme of this year’s campaign is ‘brain health for all’. 
“An estimated 400 people die of stroke every day in Pakistan while another 1,000 suffer from paralysis. Yet, this serious life-threatening condition fails to attract due state attention,” seasoned neurologist Dr Muhammad Wasay told the gathering. 
Highlighting its risk factors, he said it included high blood pressure, diabetes, tobacco consumption and high cholesterol. “We come across many patients that have all the four major risk factors. Unfortunately, in our society, people don’t value health. They think that it’s a given thing and make no effort to improve their quality of life.”
According to Dr Wasay, one third of our 40 per cent population has high blood pressure while 10m people live with diabetes. 
The diseases often go undiagnosed as people generally don’t get their blood pressure and sugar levels tested even once in a year. 
“It is highly recommended that people must have their blood pressure and sugar levels checked at least once in a year when they hit 40 years of age,” he suggested, adding that consumption of tobacco and gutka were all hazardous for health. 
Speakers at the event regretted that disease prevention was neither in the government list of priorities nor a popular concept with citizens. 
Dr Abdul Malik pointed to an acute shortage of neurologists in the country and said presently there was one neurologist available for a population of one million while the WHO guidelines suggested one neurologist for 1,000 people. 
Prevention 
Simple diet, regular walk and exercise, tobacco avoidance, they pointed out, could help prevent stroke. 
In this respect, they referred to WHO’s 10-year programme for advocacy and inter-sectoral intervention for promotion of brain health which was being actively pursued by member countries and needed to be implemented in Pakistan. 
Air pollution factor
Speaking about the connection between air pollution and brain health, Dr Nadir Ali of Pakistan Parkinson’s Society said air pollution had become a major source of concern across the world and studies had also linked it with several neurological illnesses. 
“But, the government seems to be oblivious of this situation as we see that no effective measures are being taken to address the problem,” he said.

The judge issued the directive on an application filed by the MPA’s relative Malik Waheed under Sections 22-A & B of CrPC through Mir Mangrio advocate, who sought registration of FIR against Malik Asad. 
The applicant cited superintendent of Jamshoro police complaint cell and SHO of Thana Bula Khan police station as respondents and proposed to the court to make Malik Pahar Khan and Asad Sikandar as accused in the FIR.
He said that he and his brother Malik Changez Khan were associated with Jamshoro Ittehad, a local electoral alliance formed in Jamshoro to contest the second phase of local government election. 
He said that candidates supported by the applicant and his brother were contesting LG election, which had annoyed the respondents and they issued threats to them to withdraw from the contest or face consequences.
He said that on July 21, the applicant was present at his house as well as watchmen Daud Ali and Akhtar. At around 8.15am, Malik Pahar arrived in a vehicle along with some unknown men.

Sources said that the firing that continued for around an hour was so intense that people remained indoors out of fear for their lives. After the firing came to an end, a large number of members of Mirbahar community and supporters of the independent candidate Juman Mirbahar gathered at his residence and staged a protest, accusing the ruling party candidate Juman Malkani of orchestrating the entire episode. 
Mirbahar told local journalists that his opponents had been victimising him since the day he had taken the field against them to force him to withdraw in their favour but he would never do so because people had put their trust in him. 
He said that his rivals wanted an open field for themselves but people had now become aware of their rights and they would no more support such thugs. The area police were hand and glove with influential politicians of the area and in a shameless example of sheer tyranny the DSP along with a heavy contingent of police stormed their houses instead of going after the suspects involved in the firing incident, he said. 
PPP’s Juman Malkani rejected Mirbahar’s allegations and said the opposition candidate had hatched a conspiracy to entrap him and his fellow tribesmen who commanded great support in the area for the past four decades. The day of election would decide who was in the right, he said. 
Jati SHO claimed that the situation was under control but sources revealed fear ruled the small coastal town the entire day as people were confined to their houses. 
Police have not lodged any FIR of the incident.
JI protests postponement of polls
Activists of Jamaat-i-Islami staged a demonstration in Hyderabad on Friday in protest against Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for postponing the second phase of local government election, which was earlier scheduled for July 24.
JI leaders Aqeel Ahmed Khan, Abdul Waheed Qureshi, Dr Saifur Rehman and others demanded the LG election be held in Sindh. The ECP had served the purpose of undemocratic forces by postponing election, they said.
They said that postponement of election was in fact a robbery on people’s rights. The ECP had postponed election at the behest of Sindh government and its allies, which did not want election at this time, they said.
They said that controversial delimitations, anomalies in voter lists and postponement of LG polls constituted pre-poll rigging. The Sindh government wanted to get favourable results in collaboration with ECP and for this purpose millions of rupees had been spent from public exchequer.
They said that despite arrangements polls were postponed. The first phase of LG election was held in scorching heat but the second phase was being put off on the pretext of monsoon rains, they said.

A police officer, however, shared another version of the incident saying that the alleged robber was a local resident and due to a ‘personal matter’ he killed the boy and wounded another youth, upon which the mob beat him to death.
According to Baldia SP Faizan Ali, “An incident of gunshot injury has been reported in Machhar Colony in which two boys were wounded by firing from a dacoit while he was running away. Local police arrived at the place of incident and cordoned off the area and started investigation. Meanwhile it was reported that a local mob gathered around the area, identified the dacoit, captured and killed him,” the SP said.
He added that on further investigation it was transpired that the suspect and the wounded boys lived on a same street and the incident appeared to be a ‘personal issue’.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the Docks police had brought two boys at the Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi with serious bullet wounds.
She said one of them, identified as Nabi Alam, died during treatment while the condition of second injured teenager, Noor Afsar, 17, was critical.

12,Parties take to streets against ECP decision to delay Sindh LG polls,TLP sit-in continues; JI holds citywide rallies; Murad says his govt was against postponement.,"KARACHI: Describing the decision of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) of delaying the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad as ‘blow to democracy’, the opposition parties continued their protest on Friday against the ECP decision and vowed to raise their voice against “injustice and a conspiracy of ruling parties” hatched to escape from an imminent defeat in the crucial polls.  
The Jamaat-i-Islami took out a number of rallies from parts of the city after Friday prayers. The workers of the right-wing party gathered outside the Sindh High Court building in Saddar where they staged a protest demonstration.  
Carrying party flags, placards and banners, the protesters chanted slogans against the ECP decision and raised slogans against the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, accusing it of conspiring behind the constitutional body’s move.  
Addressing the demonstration, JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman alleged that the ECP was playing “dubious and rather dirty game”.  

TLP sit-in continues; JI holds citywide rallies; Murad says his govt was against postponement

On one hand, he said, it failed to remove a political administrator during the campaign for local bodies’ polls and on the other, it played the role of a “B team” for the PPP government in Sindh by delaying the crucial polls on the pretext of rains. 
“If the rain was the issue, why doesn’t the ECP delay the local bodies’ polls for a few days,” he asked. 
He claimed that the delay for one month showed that the ECP was hand in glove with the PPP and Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P).  
TLP demands review of decision 
The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) continued its protest sit-in outside the ECP regional office and demanded that the commission review its decision.  
The leaders of the party in their addresses also accused the PPP and the ruling alliance in the Centre of deliberately delaying the electoral process in Karachi and Hyderabad.  
SUP to move court 
Sindh United Party president Syed Jalal Mehmood in a statement “condemned” the decision and announced that they would move the court to challenge the fresh schedule of the local bodies’ polls in Sindh.  
He called it a conspiracy “from the top” to favour the PPP and MQM-P as the decision of the ECP would ultimately strengthen the position of the ruling party over municipal affairs through “its political administrators” and save its partner from “devastating defeat from the province’s urban centres”.  
GDA demands re-election in all four divisions 
In a press conference, Sardar Abdul Raheem of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) — an umbrella organisation of five political parties — while rejecting the delay in the second phase of local bodies’ elections in Karachi and Hyderabad, made a different demand and called for re-election in all four divisions — Sukkur, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad and Mirpurkhas — of Sindh where the PPP won the majority through “rigging and state power”.  
He said that with fresh decision to delay the polls in Karachi and Hyderabad, the conspiracy hatched by the PPP and the ECP had been exposed as the ruling party after finding it hard to rig the elections in urban centres had used its influence in the constitutional body to delay the process.  
He asked the state institutions and judiciary to take notice of ‘sheer violation’ of electoral procedures in Sindh.  
Sindh govt ‘also against delay’ 
On the other hand, despite criticism from opposition parties, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah sounded confident that it was not his government and the party which pushed for the delay in the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad.  
“Frankly speaking, we [Sindh government] were against any delay in the second phase of local government elections,” he said while talking to journalists just after participating in the concluding ceremony of Urs of Abdullah Shah Ghazi.  
“We had even told the Election Commission that the provincial government would work to ensure the elections if any of the district receives heavy downpour. I believe that the parties which are staging demonstrations are in fact protesting against the decision of the Election Commission, not the government.”
