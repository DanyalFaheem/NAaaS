According to complainant,  Muhammad Kamran, a local factory worker, the gangsters stopped him at  gunpoint and snatched cash and cell phone from him. He also told police  that the robbers roped his arms and threw him in a field where  some victims were already lying with their hands and mouths tied.

Such a government would reflect their aspirations and hopes to ensure political and economic stability needed for promoting business, trade and investment in the country, the president said while addressing the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s (ICCI) fifth Business Excellence Awards ceremony at Aiwan-i-Sadr.
Pakistan could rise within a decade if it strengthened its democracy and its leadership made the right decisions, curbed corruption, upheld justice and promoted human rights, he said and stressed that consultative institutions, trade and investment and passion were key ingredients that helped nations prosper. At the same time, Pakistan needed to maintain cordial relations with all global partners and avoid becoming a party to divisive politics in international relations, President Alvi said. 
Urging the business community to invest in developing intellectual avenues, he said upgrading human resources in different sectors of the economy, especially the IT sector, could help Pakistan achieve high economic growth rates.
The president also highlighted that polarisation in Indian society was on the rise and the situation of its minorities, especially Muslims, was alarming.
The religious minorities in India were facing intimidation, harassment and discrimination at the hands of the Hindu majority, he said.
When India’s business interests took a hit, the country was forced to take action against those who hurt the religious sentiments of Muslims, President Alvi said, but stressed that high moral and ethical standards should be the basis of global order instead of vested interests.

The training was held from July 18 to July 22 at the Levies headquarters in Quetta. The training for the first batch was held from June 27 to July 1 for 34 investigation officers.
The UNODC will commence training of the same investigation officers on advanced investigation skills to build on their initial knowledge and skills.

Speaking at a podcast, she deplored that most people were unfamiliar with e-commerce due to a lack of basic awareness and training opportunities in the province.
“The government has increased the e-commerce transaction limit from $5,000 to $25,000 per month,” she said, adding that the initiative had helped increase the foreign exchange in the sector from $214 million to $396m.
Dr Rubaba noted that about one million freelancers in the country were not registered anywhere, though the Ministry of Information Technology had recently started their registration.

6,MNA ceases to hold office as he takes oath of MPA: ECP,Commission cites Article 223 in response to objections to PTI leader Zain Qureshi’s right to vote in Punjab CM’s poll.,"ISLAMABAD: Respon­ding to objections raised against PTI leader Zain Qu­­reshi’s membership of the Punjab Assembly that he won in the recent by-elections, the Election Com­mis­sion of Pakistan (ECP) main­­tained that it held no water, as Mr Qureshi ceased to be a member of the Natio­nal Assembly the moment he took oath as an MPA.
An ECP official told Dawn that under the Constitution no individual could concurrently hold seats in two separate houses of parliament or a provincial assembly, but added it was the discretion of the individual to decide which seat to keep, after winning another seat.
The commission was commenting on the situation that arose at the outset of Friday’s Punjab Assembly session to elect a chief minister, when PML-N MPA Khalil Tahir Sandhu, speaking on a point of order, claimed newly minted PTI MPA Zain Qureshi was still an MNA as his resignation (along with those of all PTI lawmakers in the lower house) had yet to be accepted by the NA speaker, and that he could not cast his vote in the CM’s election.
PA Deputy Speaker Dost Mazari replied that under Article 223(4) of the Constitution, a member ceased to be an MNA after he became an MPA. Subsequently, he allowed Mr Qureshi to cast his vote.

Commission cites Article 223 in response to objections to PTI leader Zain Qureshi’s right to vote in Punjab CM’s poll

Mr Sandhu also raised an objection against the right to vote of PTI MPA Shabbir Gujjar, saying the latter had a case pending in the ECP. At this, PTI’s former law minister Raja Basharat said the election commission had granted Gujjar permission to vote. Subsequently, Mazari turned down the objection.
Explaining Article 223(1) of the Constitution, the ECP official said “no person shall, at the same time, be a member of both Houses, or a House and a provincial assembly; or the Assemblies of two or more Provinces; or a House or a Provincial Assembly in respect of more than one seat”.
He further said Article 223(2) of the Constitution reads: “Nothing in clause (1) shall prevent a person from being a candidate for two or more seats at the same time, whether in the same body or in different bodies, but if he is elected to more than one seat he shall, within a period of thirty days after the declaration of the result for the last such seat, resign all but one of his seats, and if he does not so resign, all the seats to which he has been elected shall become vacant at the expiration of the said period of thirty days except the seat to which he has been elected last or, if he has been elected to more than one seat on the same day, the seat for election to which his nomination was filed last.”
Zain Qureshi, the son of former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, had won from Multan’s PP-217 constituency in last Sunday’s by-polls, defeating his opponent, PML-N’s Muhammad Salman Naeem, with a wide margin.
Previously, he was elected as a member of the National Assembly from NA-157 Multan in August 2018 and was among the 131 PTI MNAs to have tendered their resignations from the lower house in May after former premier Imran Khan was ousted through a no-confidence vote.

7,Newly merged KP districts get first-ever policing plans,"Plans to lead transition from local policing to formal policing; new police stations, training for Levies, Khasadar part of plans.","ISLAMABAD: The seven newly merged districts (NMD) of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa will have their first-ever policing plans to transition from local policing to formal policing and justice system. 
The ‘Policing Plans for the Merged Areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’ launched on Friday were jointly developed by the KP Police and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with funding from the Japanese government. 
The plans, which will be implemented in Bajaur, Mohmand, Khyber, Orakzai, North Waziristan, South Waziristan and Kurram, present a framework for “people-centric policing services in partnership with the local communities and other agencies of the criminal justice system”. 
The plans were developed under the auspices of the project ‘Strengthening Rule of Law for Peacebuilding in the NMDs of Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa’. 

Plans to lead transition from local policing to formal policing; new police stations, training for Levies, Khasadar part of plans

Under the project, five new police stations would be built in Bajaur, Mohmand, North Waziristan and Kurram, along with the training of 278 former Levies and Khasadar forces who were recently integrated into the KP Police. 
The policing plans also propose recommendations to address resource and capacity gaps. 
Speaking on the occasion, Japan’s Ambassador to Pakistan Wada Mitsuhiro said that improving police service in the NMDs would ensure a smooth transition to equitable public security and justice delivery. This plan is a crucial milestone in achieving this essential objective, he added. 
UNDP Pakistan Resident Representative Knut Ostby said that the plans would lead to better policing that is people-centred and responsive to the needs of local communities. 
KP Inspector-General of Police Moazzam Jah Ansari said that the policing plans present a road map to guide the post-merger transition in policing and better service delivery to the people. 
The next phase will be the successful implementation of this plan across the NMDs, he added.

8,Senate panel calls for provision of foolproof security to Sarfaraz Bugti,He recently escaped unhurt after a roadside bomb was detonated close to his convoy in Balochistan’s Rojhanpur area.,"ISLAMABAD: A Senate committee on Friday dem­a­nded provision of foolproof security to former provincial home minister and Balo­ch­is­tan Awami Party (BAP) Sen­a­tor Sarfaraz Ahmad Bugti, who recently escaped unhurt after a roadside bomb was detonated close to his convoy in Balochistan’s Rojhanpur area. 
The Senate Standing Committee on Interior, which met with Senator Mohsin Aziz in the chair, asked the special secretary of the Ministry of Interior to deploy both Fron­tier Corps and police officials for the security of Senator Bugti within three days. 
The committee expressed resentment over the absence of the inspectors general of Balochistan and Khyber Pa­­khtunkhwa as they had been summoned to brief the panel on the recent incidents of attack on the convoy of Sena­tor Bugti and on the house of Senator Haji Hidayatullah Khan in Din Bihar Colony, Peshawar. 
“If this is the attitude towards parliamentarians, let alone the security and safety of the general public,” Senator Moula Bux Chandio of the PPP remarked. 
The committee said the abs­ence of the IGs of Baloch­istan, KP and Islamabad is unacceptable. “The absence of the IGs has been observed 16 times now,” pointed out Senator Shahadat Awan. The interior secretary and the KP chief secretary were also absent. 
Senator Bugti said that so far no organisation has clai­med responsibility for the att­ack. “Forty-nine target killings have been reported in the area so far; we need a se­­cure environment,” he noted. 
The committee chairman deferred the matter with a directive for the special interior secretary to provide security to Senators Bugti and Hidayatullah. The committee sought progress report on the attack on the convoy of Senator Bugti and of all such incidents, including target killings in the area, and act­ions taken against the attackers. The committee also poin­ted out that further absence of the officials will entail disciplinary action against them. 
The progress report submitted by the senior superintendent of police in Sarfaraz Bugti case stated that apparently a roadside timer or remote-controlled IED was used in the incident. However, on receipt of report from PFSA, the exact details of the explosive used in the incident shall be available. 
No weapon was recovered from the site of occurrence. The report also said that no casualty was reported. One gunmen of Senator Bugti sustained injuries. The officials ensured that all efforts are being made to arrest the people involved in the attack. 
On the matter of bomb attack on the house of Senator Hidayatullah Khan, the Peshawar SSP apprised the committee that no lead in the case has been found so far. “There is no Peshawar safe city project which can aid such cases,” the SSP added.

9,ECP notifies PML-N victory in PP-7,Raja Sagheer secures 12 more votes; Shireen Mazari says commission clearly biased against PTI.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday notified PML-N’s Raja Sagheer Ahmed as the winner after his victory in recently held by-polls in Punjab was challenged by the rival PTI. 
A day after the July 17 elections, Mr Ahmed emerged as the winning candidate in Rawalpindi’s PP-7 constituency with a margin of just 49 votes, bagging 68,906 votes compared to 68,857 secured by the PTI candidate, Mohammad Shabbir Awan. 
The PTI challenged the razor-thin victory margin, besides the delayed announcement of results and a high number of rejected votes, and sought a recount of votes rejected by the returning officer and the ECP. 
Mr Ahmed was notified hours before the crucial election for Punjab’s chief minister on Friday and the development followed the overnight consolidation of results by the returning officer (RO), who was earlier restrained from doing so until the election commission passed an order on the recount plea. 

Raja Sagheer secures 12 more votes; Shireen says commission clearly biased against PTI

The notification was issued after the scrutiny of rejected votes cast was hurriedly carried out and surprisingly led to a further increase in the votes of PML-N’s candidate by 12, from 68,906 to 68,918. The number of PTI candidate’s votes also increased by six to 68,863. 
The ECP “has decided to leave no space for any doubt about its bias against PTI,” PTI leader Shireen Mazari tweeted after the notification. “The law requires a recount if the margin of win is 5pc or less than 5pc. In case of PP-7 that is the case. Critical also is the deliberate damage to ballots by RO staff’s wrong stamping.”
Earlier, in his petition filed with the ECP, PTI candidate Mr Awan listed alleged irregularities at 21 polling stations and claimed that even votes of deceased individuals had been polled in the constituency.

10,Military huddle discusses ‘peace talks’ with TTP,"Decides to pursue matter in accordance with ""comprehensive security strategy"".","ISLAMABAD: A high-level military huddle on Friday discussed ‘peace talks’ with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and decided to pursue the matter in accordance with “comprehensive security strategy”. 
The national security meeting, chaired by Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Nadeem Raza, was attended by all three services chiefs — Chief of Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Muhammad Amjad Khan Niazi and Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu —, ISI Director General Lt Gen Nadeem Anjum, Peshawar Corps Commander Lt Gen Faiz Hamid, and other senior officials. 
Though the meeting carried the impression of a Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee session, it wasn’t one. A JCSC meeting would normally include the director general of Strategic Plans Division, and secretaries of ministries of defence and defence production, but none of them were there. 
It was the first of such meetings, involving all the armed services, since the army-led talks with the militants in Afghanistan assumed a public profile with briefings for political leaders and the Parliamentary Committee on National Security on the issue by the army top brass. 

Decides to pursue matter in accordance with ‘comprehensive security strategy’

“The forum was given a detailed briefing on review of national security situation specific to Western Border, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan,” the ISPR said about the meeting. It added that “fast-paced developments in the realm of strategic and conventional policies, the importance of peace in Afghanistan for sustainable development in the region and the operational preparedness of the armed forces” were also discussed. 
The participants, the ISPR said, resolved to respond to “entire spectrum of threats” in accordance with the “comprehensive security strategy”. 
It apparently means that the approach would go beyond the usual ‘kinetic strategy’ — an apparent reference to the peace talks. 
The military leadership had told the political leadership at the earlier briefings that it wanted to give peace a chance, but would respond with full force if the TTP did not abide by the agreement that may be eventually concluded. 
The meeting noted its “complete satisfaction” and “full confidence” in the readiness of all the three services. 
The participants, the ISPR said, while reaffirming the resolve of the armed forces to befittingly respond to the threats, “lauded the sacrifices of security agencies in the fight against terrorism”.

11,"Govt welcomes, opposition rejects Hamza’s election as CM",KARACHI: The last-minute drama that turned the tables on the opposition PTI-PML-Q alliance in the Punjab Assembly on...,"KARACHI: The last-minute drama that turned the tables on the opposition PTI-PML-Q alliance in the Punjab Assembly on Friday, leading to the surprise election of PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz as chief minister drew mixed reaction, with the coalition government welcoming it and the opposition rejecting it as against the norms of democracy. 
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took to Twitter to celebrate the victory of his son. He showered praise on PML-Q chief Shujaat Hus­sain, the main character behind the turnaround, for maintaining the democratic traditions that his great family has upheld all along. 
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb thanked Allah for the success of PML-N’s candidate in the election for Punjab CM. In a thinly-veiled reference to the PTI leadership, they said Allah did not like arrogance.   
They said the decision made by Chaudhry Shujaat would serve to keep the country from “Imrani fitna”. Taking potshots at Imran Khan, they accused the PTI chairman of trying to plunge the country into chaos.
They said PML-N and its allied parties welcomed “the great decision made by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain”.
Rana Sana warned Imran Khan against hurling threats and said the government would tackle the matter strictly if the PTI tried to disrupt law and order. There will be no compromise on the rule of law, he said.
Referring to the Supreme Court’s verdict in the presidential reference, the ministers said it was made abundantly clear by the court that no legislator could vote against the directives issued by their party heads. It was in light of this judgement that 25 members of the Punjab Assembly were deseated. 
The interior minister condemned hurling threats on government officials. 
In his comment, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari wrote on Twitter: “Aik Zardari Sab Pe Bhaari.”
In a statement, Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Shazia Marri said PPP leader Asif Zardari and Chaudhry Shujaat had again strengthened the politics of tolerance. 
Criticising the PTI, she said the Imran-led party had introduced the politics of name-calling and threats in the country.
While ridiculing the manner in which the election for CM was conducted, PTI leader and former deputy speaker Qasim Suri tweeted: “Constitution Article 63A(b): Direction to vote for or against a candidate is issued to party legislators by parliamentary party in a legislature & not by party head. 
“So it is PMLQ parliamentary party in Punjab Assembly which directs its members & not Ch. Shujaat.”
In another tweet while ref­erring to Chaudhry Shujaat’s letter, he wrote in Urdu, “Khat party kay 10 parliamani arakeen soobai assembly ko aana thha lekin kabutar deputy speaker ki table par rakh aaya.”
In his tweet, another PTI leader Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said that a “greedy and elite class” had taken over the country and they least bothered about the rule of law, logic and ethics. 
“We must snatch our country from them and force them out of the country. There is no other solution”, he wrote. “Imported Hukumat namanzoor”.




 
PML-Q chief Shujaat Hussain has maintained the democratic traditions that his great family has upheld all along. The role played by Chaudhry Shujaat ensured victory of constitutional values.” 
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 
How crucial this election had become can be gauged from the fact that the house of the Chaudhrys of Gujrat that remained united throughout all political changes spanning over decades fell apart on Friday. In the contest, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi got 186 votes against Hamza Shehbaz’s 179. However, Hamza emerged as winner as PML-Q’s 10 votes were not counted on the basis of Chaudhry Shujaat’ letter asking the party’s MPAs not to vote for the candidate backed by PTI chairman Imran Khan.



 
We reject Punjab Assembly deputy  speaker’s decision. Article 63A(b) says direction to vote is issued to party legislators by parliamentary party in a legislature & not by party head.” Former NA deputy speaker Qasim Suri PM Sharif said the role played by Chaudhry Shujaat was in fact victory of constitutional values. 
He also paid tribute to PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari for the “historic role” that he played for upholding the Constitution, democracy and the interests of masses. 



 
PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari and PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat have again strengthened the politics of tolerance. Imran-led party had introduced the politics of name-calling and threats.”  Federal Minister Shazia Marri
