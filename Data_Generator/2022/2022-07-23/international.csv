A lawyer acting for an exiled Iranian opposition group said the Brussels appeal court had ordered that the Belgian government not hand over Assadollah Assadi to Iran without allowing the decision to be legally challenged and confirmed by a judge.
Georges-Henri Beauthier, a lawyer acting for the exiled opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), said the court had granted an order that the government’s case for any proposed release of Assadi be subject to “cross-examination before a judge”.
“Before this hearing, the Belgian state cannot proceed to a prisoner transfer,” he said.
The court order, according to the Belga news agency, stipulated that “it is provisionally forbidden to the state of Belgium, under penalty of 500,000 euros, to attempt by any means to transfer Mr Assadollah”.
On Wednesday, after two days of rowdy debate, the Belgian parliament ratified an agreement with Iran to allow prisoner swaps, raising the prospect that Assadi’s 20-year sentence might be cut short and he be sent back to Tehran.
Prime Minister Alexander De Croo’s government wants to win the release of 41-year-old detained aid worker Olivier Vandecasteele, and ministers say they fear for the safety of some 200 Belgian citizens living and working in Iran.
But many in the opposition and the NCRI, which has held street protests against the prisoner deal, say the agreement would grant impunity to Iranian agents like Assadi, convicted last year of masterminding a plot to bomb a political rally near Paris.

1,Aviation nurses nasty headache as travel recovers from Covid,Industry faces mounting worries over supply chains and reminders that its future hinges on decarbonisation.,"FARNBOROUGH (United Kingdom): Aerospace has turned the page on an unprecedented pandemic demand shock with dozens of new orders at its largest air show in three years _ only to face mounting worries over supply chains and reminders that its future hinges on decarbonisation.
From rural Farnborough to nearby Heathrow, this week brought stark evidence of the supply crunch now entangling manufacturers and airlines alike, with shortages of both labour and parts.
It comes as airlines _ whose expansion had propelled the industry to record profits in the past decade, only to collapse during the pandemic _ are desperate to cash in on a nascent recovery in international travel.
Even the Farnborough Airshow struggled to find enough hospitality staff despite downsizing from a seven-day aviation festival to a five-day trade show with no weekend aerobatics.
“We have to accept that a lot of people left the aviation industry and the aerospace industry during 2020 and it is difficult to bring them back,” Emirates president Tim Clark told delegates after clashing with Heathrow over capacity curbs.
Departing Farnborough attendees got a personal taste of the resulting travel chaos after discussing their own shortages of labour, parts and materials at the July 18-22 aerospace event.
Long lines formed at Britain’s airports, Eurostar train terminal and the port of Dover on Friday - the start of the busiest travel weekend since 2019.
For years, the alternating Farnborough and Paris air shows fed a fast-growing ecosystem as airlines lavished new orders on manufacturers, who served that demand in part by encouraging their supply chains to set up facilities in purchasing nations.
Posters this week continued that theme of a connected, cleaner world as suppliers defended emissions targets, but campaigners said they did not go far enough.
Now, global supply chains need fixing and Western factories and the airlines they serve are also beset by problems. Longer term, analysts say supply chains are likely to get shorter.
“This is not a great year to say ‘you need a new supplier, have you thought about setting up here’,” a senior aerospace executive said.  “The industry is hunkering down this week; there are not a lot of discussions with edge players or new entrants.”  Airbus in particular is wrestling with delays as it tries to increase output in anticipation of higher demand. In part that is down to engine shortages, which in some cases have been traced to glitches at tiny suppliers, executives said.
‘Strong Fundamentals’ 
Despite the summer rebound — outbound airline bookings from the UK for example are at 88% of pre-pandemic levels, according to ForwardKeys - there were warnings that inflation could slow the rebound in air traffic that ultimately supports jet demand.
Boeing cut jet demand forecasts this week, while saying they remained stable after adjusting for war-sanctioned Russia. “Population growth says travel is going to continue strong, so production rates have strong fundamentals behind them,” said Stephen Timm, president of Collins Aerospace.
“The question is, are the near term economics going to change the slope of the curve? That’s the question we’re all asking,” he told Reuters, while adding the Raytheon unit would work to support planemakers’ ramp-up plans.
Boeing sought to answer that question, and lift concerns over the future of its 737 MAX cash-cow, with a flurry of announcements that translated into gains in its share price.
The future of the MAX, in the wake of two fatal crashes, a two-year grounding and ongoing regulatory issues, is key for the aerospace industry and airlines that have invested hundreds of billions of dollars in making or buying the medium-haul planes.
“Airlines want to support Boeing because they recognise that if they don’t, the competitive balance is irreparably damaged and with it any attempt to get discounts,” Agency Partners analyst Sash Tusa said.
Airline industry boss Willie Walsh this week also reiterated warnings of becoming too dependent on Europe’s Airbus in the $150 billion jet market’s transatlantic duopoly.
Sitting on a hefty order backlog, Airbus had a quiet week after a massive recent order from China, allowing it to focus instead on setting out decarbonisation plans in Britain’s record heat, while leaving the Farnborough stage to rival Boeing.
“It doesn’t mean we are less committed to taking orders and growing the company,” Chief Executive Guillaume Faury told Reuters.  “It’s probably just that the demand is less synchronised (with the air show) and that the supply chain issues are more (pressing) than in the past.”

2,Iran says Saudis ready to make talks more meaningful,Since April last year Iraq has hosted five rounds of talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran.,"TEHRAN: Iran and Saudi Arabia are ready to move reconciliation talks to a higher level, more than a year after they began and six years after the two rivals severed relations, Iran’s foreign minister said on Thursday.
Since April last year Iraq has hosted five rounds of talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which support opposing sides in various conflicts around the region.
“Progress has been made in these negotiations,” Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in an interview with Iran’s state broadcaster.
He added that last week Iran had received a message from Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein who said “the Saudi side is ready to move the talks to the political and public level”. 
Iran’s top diplomat noted that previous rounds had mainly been at the level of security officials.
“We announced our readiness for the talks to enter the political stage,” he said.
In 2016, protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran after the kingdom executed Shia cleric Nimr al Nimr. Riyadh responded by cutting ties with Tehran.
Amir-Abdollahian said he hoped that the negotiations with Riyadh would lead to “normal diplomatic ties between Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran”. Officials in Tehran have previously said that holding talks on a political level could yield better and faster results.
After the last round of negotiations in April, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Kadhemi said he believed that  “reconciliation is near” between Riyadh and Tehran, a further reflection of shifting political alignments across the region.
Following the severance of ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi downgraded diplomatic relations with Tehran and Kuwait recalled its ambassador. Last week the United Arab Emirates said it was  “considering” appointing an ambassador in Tehran.

3,US citizen detained in Myanmar,"YANGON: An American citizen is being wrongfully detained in junta-ruled Myanmar, a US embassy spokesperson said on...","YANGON: An American citizen is being wrongfully detained in junta-ruled Myanmar, a US embassy spokesperson said on Friday.
“We are aware of the wrongful detention of a US citizen in Burma,” the spokesperson said, using the country’s former name.
The US has led Western criticism of the coup that ousted Aung San Suu Kyi’s government last year and slapped sanctions on top-ranking members of the junta and military-linked companies. Several foreigners have since been arrested in the junta’s crackdown on dissent.
On Tuesday, President Joe Biden opened the way for sanctions against governments that unjustly imprison Americans and ordered more detailed travel warnings after a series of high-profile detentions.
The move came after wide media coverage of the detention in Russia on drug charges of basketball star Brittney Griner, whose wife initially said Biden was not doing enough.
The US State Department, in its travel advisories for Americans, now highlights in which nations there is an elevated risk of unjust detention.
Myanmar has been included in the initial group of nations that will bear a “D” mark for detention risk, along with China, Iran, North Korea, Russia and Venezuela.
In an updated travel advisory, the State Department said it had determined that “at least one US national” was wrongfully detained in Myanmar.
Polish photojournalist Robert Bociaga and Japanese journalist Yuki Kitazumi were both detained during the early protests against the coup.
US citizen Nathan Maung was arrested in March last year during a police raid on the media outlet he ran and charged with encouraging dissent against the military.
He was released months later.

The Turkish army has maintained dozens of outposts over the past 25 years across northern Iraq’s autonomous Kurdish region as part of its campaign against rebels.
“Two bomb-laden drones that attacked the Turkish base in the village of Bamerne this morning were shot down without causing any casualties,” the village’s mayor, Miran Ismail, said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, but a pro-Iran Telegram channel popular among pro-Tehran armed factions in Iraq praised an action of “the Iraqi resistance”. On Wednesday, artillery strikes on a recreation area in Kurdistan killed nine civilians, including women and children, and wounded another 23.

5,"UN court rejects Myanmar’s pleas, rules genocide case can go ahead",Decision paves way for full hearings at court on allegations over majority-Buddhist Myanmar’s bloody 2017 crackdown on Rohingya.,"THE HAGUE: The UN’s highest court ruled on Friday that a landmark case accusing the Myanmar government of genocide against Rohingya Muslims can go ahead.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague threw out all of Myanmar’s objections to a case filed by the west African nation of Gambia in 2019.
The decision paves the way for full hearings at the court on allegations over majority-Buddhist Myanmar’s bloody 2017 crackdown on the Rohingya.
Joan Donoghue, the ICJ president, said the tribunal  “finds that it has jurisdiction... to entertain the application filed by the Gambia, and that the said application is admissible”.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled the south-east Asian country during the operation five years ago, bringing with them harrowing reports of murder, rape and arson.
Around 850,000 Rohingya are languishing in camps in  Bangladesh while another 600,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar’s south-western Rakhine state.
Myanmar was originally represented at the ICJ by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, but she 
was ousted as civilian leader in a coup last year and is now in detention.
Mainly-Muslim Gambia filed the case in November 2019 alleging that Myanmar’s treatment of the Rohingya breached the 1948 UN Genocide Convention.
Myanmar’s arguments rejected 
Myanmar had argued on several grounds that the court had no jurisdiction in the matter, and should dismiss the case while it is still in its preliminary stages.
But judges unanimously rejected Myanmar’s argument that Gambia was acting as a “proxy” of the 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation in the case.
Only states, and not organisations, are allowed to file cases at the ICJ, which has ruled on disputes between countries since just after World War II.
They also unanimously dismissed Myanmar’s assertions that Gambia could not file the case because it was not a direct party to the alleged genocide, and that Myanmar had opted out of a relevant part of the genocide convention.
Finally they threw out by 15-1 Myanmar’s claim that there was no formal dispute at the time Gambia filed the case, and that the court therefore had no jurisdiction.
It could take years for full hearings and a final judgement in the case.
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken declared in March that the Myanmar military’s violence against the Rohingya amounted to genocide.
The International Criminal Court, a war crimes tribunal based in The Hague, has also launched an investigation into the violence against the Rohingya.

The journalist, Gil Tam­ary of Israel’s Channel 13, on Monday posted to Twitter video of himself sneaking into Makkah in defiance of a ban on non-Muslims.
Saudi police have “referred a citizen” to prosecutors for alleged complicity in “transferring and facilitating the entry of a (non-Muslim) journalist”, a police spokesperson said in comments reported by the official Saudi Press Agency.
The agency did not name the journalist, but said he is an American citizen, whose case has been referred to prosecutors “to take the necessary procedures against him in accordance with the applied laws”.
Despite growing behind-the-scenes business and security contacts, Saudi Arabia does not recognise Israel and did not join the 2020 US-brokered Abraham Accords that saw the Jewish state establish ties with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
In his roughly 10-minute clip, Tamary visits Mount Arafat, where Muslim pilgrims gather to pray during the climax of the Haj.
He makes clear he knows that what he’s doing is outlawed, but says he wanted to showcase “a place that is so important to our Muslim brothers and sisters”.
Tamary’s justification, and subsequent apology, did little to quiet angry Saudi social media responses.
The controversy followed US President Joe Biden’s visit to both Israel and Saudi Arabia last week.

7,Thousands flee feuding Taliban in Afghanistan’s north,"Ethnicity, religious sectarianism, and a battle for a lump of lucrative coal resources are at the heart of the fighting.","DUZDANCHISMA: When fighting erupted between Taliban and a breakaway group led by one of their former commanders in northern Afghanistan last month, Zahra and her family fled to the mountains.
For days they walked across the rocky terrain, unsure what lay ahead or when they might return to their home in Sar-i-Pol province’s Balkhab district, where the clashes erupted.
“We didn’t want to get trapped... we all might have been killed,” said Zahra, 35, asking to use a pseudonym for security reasons.
Zahra’s family is among thousands that fled conflict between the Taliban and fighters loyal to Mahdi Mujahid, the group’s former intelligence chief for Bamiyan.
Ethnicity, religious sectarianism, and a battle for a lump of Balkhab’s lucrative coal resources are at the heart of the fighting.
“All these factors are working together in driving the conflict,” Australia-based political analyst Nematullah Bizhan said.
Mujahid, a Shia Hazara, joined the mostly Sunni and Pashtun Taliban in 2019, and was appointed to his post soon after the hardline group seized power in August last year.
Afghanistan’s Hazaras have faced persecution for decades, with the Taliban accused of abuses against the community when they first ruled from 1996 to 2001.
They are also the target of attacks by the militant Islamic State group, which considers them heretics.
Mujahid’s appointment was initially seen as supporting the Taliban’s claim of being more inclusive to non-Pashtuns, but he soon fell foul of the leadership.
The group routinely denies reports of infighting in its ranks, but last month media said Mujahid split with the Taliban leadership when Kabul sought greater control over the coal business.
History of resistance 
Balkhab is home to several coal mines and demand has soared in recent months with Pakistan stepping up imports to fuel power plants.
Local Taliban commanders were known to “tax” trucks on their way to Pakistan -- as officials in the previous government did before them -- but when Mujahid resisted Kabul’s efforts to rein in the practice, they sacked him.
“Balkhab has a long history of resisting the government,” analyst Bizhan said, adding the region also fought strongly against the Taliban during their first reign.
While the June fighting lasted only a few days, the United Nations says it displaced at least 27,000 people -- almost all of them Hazara.
The result is a humanitarian crisis that aid agencies are now struggling to deal with.
“We used to sleep thirsty on empty stomachs and wake up in the morning and start walking again,” said Zahra, whose family walked for nearly a fortnight before finding shelter in a village mosque in Bamiyan.
“Everyone was sick.” 
The family of Barat Ali Subhani, another resident of Balkhab, has taken refuge in the same mosque.
“We didn’t have anything with us. We just left in clothes we were wearing,” Subhani said.
His seven-member family walked for four days before a shepherd led them to the mosque.
“He saved us,” Subhani said.
“We had nothing. We thought that we will probably die.”

“Heat kills. Over the past decades, hundreds of thousands of people have died as a result of extreme heat during extended heatwaves, often with simultaneous wildfires,” WHO regional director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement.
“This year, we have already witnessed more than 1,700 needless deaths in the present heatwave in Spain and Portugal alone,” Kluge added.
The regional director stressed that exposure to extreme heat “often exacerbates pre-existing health conditions” and noted that “individuals at either end of life’s spectrum - infants and older people - are at particular risk”.
Responding to a query, WHO Europe explained that the figure is a preliminary estimate based on reports by national authorities, and that the toll had “already increased and will increase further over the coming days”.
The true number of deaths linked to the heatwave won’t be known for weeks, he said, adding “this scorching summer season is barely halfway done”.
“Ultimately, this week’s events point yet again to the desperate need for pan-European action to effectively tackle climate change,” Kluge said.

9,Ex-Trump aide found guilty of contempt over Capitol assault hearing,Federal jury finds Steve Bannon guilty of contempt of Congress for defying subpoena to testify before lawmakers probing assault.,"WASHINGTON: A federal jury found ex-US president Donald Trump’s former aide Steve Bannon guilty of contempt of Congress on Friday for defying a subpoena to testify before lawmakers investigating the assault on the US Capitol.
Bannon, who led Trump’s 2016 presidential election campaign, was among hundreds of people called by a House of Representatives committee to testify about the storming of Congress by Trump supporters on January 6, 2021.
The 68-year-old Republican strategist did not appear on the summons date or provide requested documents, and was indicted on two charges of contempt of Congress.
The 12-person jury deliberated for less than three hours before finding Bannon guilty of both misdemeanor charges.
Bannon, who served as Trump’s strategy chief at the White House before being sacked in 2017, faces a minimum of 30 days in jail and a maximum sentence of a year for each count.
Sentencing was set for October.
Presenting the government’s case, prosecutor Amanda Vaughn told the jury that Bannon was  “not above the law” and had made a  “deliberate decision” not to obey the subpoena.
Bannon’s attorneys did not call any witnesses during the brief trial and he did not testify in his own defense.
Bannon’s lawyer Evan Corcoran denied his client had ignored the subpoena, saying the date was  “the subject of ongoing discussions and negotiation” and  “flexible.” The decision to hold Bannon in contempt was politically motivated, Corcoran claimed.
Vaughn said the House committee had cause to believe Bannon and other Trump advisors may have information on links between the White House and the Capitol rioters.
According to the committee, Bannon spoke to Trump the day before thousands of his supporters stormed the Capitol in an effort to block the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory.
They had been egged on by Trump in a fiery speech near the White House, during which he repeated his false claims of election fraud.
After refusing to testify for months, Bannon finally agreed to cooperate with the House investigation, a move prosecutors dismissed as a “last-ditch attempt to avoid accountability”.

Israel has been carrying out strikes for years against what it has described as Iranian and Iran-backed targets in Syria, where Tehran has deployed forces in support of President Bashar al Assad since a civil war began in 2011.
Citing a military source, Syria’s Sana news agency said Israel “carried out an aerial aggression” just after midnight, firing missiles from the Golan Heights targeting “a number of positions in the vicinity of Damascus”.
Syrian air defences managed to shoot down some of the missiles, Sana added.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Israeli missiles had been fired at targets including air force intelligence offices in the area of Mezze air base on the western edge of Damascus. An Iranian weapons store on the southern outskirts of Damascus was also destroyed, said the Observatory, which reports on the war using what it describes as a network of sources on all sides.
The Syrian government last reported an Israeli attack on July 2 which it said targeted an area south of the Mediterranean city of Tartus and injured two civilians.
Syria briefly halted flights to and from Damascus airport last month after saying an Israeli attack damaged the airstrip and a terminal.
Iran said two officers from its Revolutionary Guards were killed in an Israeli air strike in Syria in March, prompting Tehran to vow revenge.

Britain’s departure from the European Union means passengers bound for France face enhanced checks by French officials.
The port has increased customs booths to accelerate the process but it said on Friday they were under staffed, leading to gridlock in Dover on what is typically one of the busiest periods of travel, when schools break up for summer.
A local French police body said delays had been caused by an “unexpected technical incident” at the Channel Tunnel, without elaborating. The French embassy in London later tweeted that all border checks were perating at full capacity.
Liz Truss, Britain’s foreign secretary who is competing to become the next prime minister, said the “awful situation” was unacceptable.
“We need action from France to build up capacity at the border to limit any further disruption for British tourists and to ensure this appalling situation is avoided in future,” she said in a statement.
The major delays at the port come as some airports also struggle to recruit enough staff to manage the post-pandemic rebound in travel, leading to chaotic scenes at London airports.
A spokeswoman for the Port of Dover said CEO Doug Bannister had declared the situation a ‘critical incident’. They did not specify what it meant in practical terms.
“To be let down in the way that we have is just so frustrating,” Bannister said.
Graham Stuart, Britain’s minister of state for Europe, told Sky News that the government had been working with France to clear the backlog at the port, which handles 12 million passengers each year.
“We are doing everything we can ... it is not a border force problem as such, it is the French authorities. All we can do is continue to work with them,” Stuart said.
Dover and Calais have what is known as juxtaposed border controls, where French authorities check passports on British soil before departure, and vice versa in France.
“Please arrive prepared for a prolonged wait - carry snacks and additional water with you,” P&O Ferries, one of the main passenger operators from Dover, said on Twitter. The operator said its services from Calais were operating smoothly.

Harry, Queen Elizabeth’s grandson, received the full police protection generally given to royal figures before he decided to step back from his royal duties and move to the United States with wife Meghan in 2020.
But the Home Office the UK ministry responsible for policing, immigration and security decided in February that year that Harry would cease receiving personal police security while in Britain even if he were to cover the cost himself.
On Friday, a British High Court judge granted permission for part of Harry’s claim for a judicial review - a process where a judge examines the lawfulness of a public body’s decision.
Price Harry’s lawyers - who have previously said in court that a member of the royal household was involved in the decision - were not immediately reachable for comment.
There have been signs of tensions between Harry and the royal family since at least 2019, when he and Meghan decided to set up their own household, breaking from the joint operation they had with Prince William and his wife Kate.
Harry and Meghan have relied on a private security team since moving to California, where they live with their two young children.
Harry’s lawyers, however, have said that private security arrangements did not give the prince the level of protection he needed while visiting Britain.
Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, died in a Paris car crash while trying to escape paparazzi photographers, and the prince, also known as the Duke of Sussex, has expressed worries about “history repeating itself”, in an apparent reference to the 1997 tragedy.
Harry and Meghan have in recent years received critical coverage in parts of the British press, which he has described as “toxic”.
Friday’s permission was granted on several different grounds although not on all of those the prince’s legal team had sought, a judgement published on the court’s website showed.

13,"Ancient Siberian dogs relied on humans for seafood, says study","WASHINGTON: As early as 7,400 years ago, Siberian dogs had evolved to be far smaller than wolves, making them more...","WASHINGTON: As early as 7,400 years ago, Siberian dogs had evolved to be far smaller than wolves, making them more dependent on humans for food, including sea mammals and fish trapped below the ice, according to a new study released on Friday.
Robert Losey of the University of Alberta, who led the research published in Science Advances, said the findings helped explain the growth in the early dog population, as people put them to work for hunting, herding and sledding.
“The long-term changes in dog diet have really been oversimplified,” he said, explaining that prior work had focused only on two main ideas to explain how dogs transitioned from wolves, a process that began some 40,000 years ago.
The first of these was that friendlier wolves approached human camps during the Ice Age to scavenge for meat, eventually became isolated from their wild counterparts, and were then intentionally bred into dogs.
The second was that some dogs evolved a better capacity to digest starches following the agricultural revolution, which is why some modern dog breeds have more copies of the AMY2B gene that creates pancreatic amylase.
To study ancient dog diets in more depth, Losey and colleagues analysed the remains of around 200 ancient dogs from the past 11,000 years, and a similar number of ancient wolves.
“We had to go to collections all over Siberia, we analyzed those bones, took samples of the collagen, and analyzed the protein in labs,” he said.
Based on the remains, the team made statistical estimates for body sizes.
They also used a technique called stable isotope analysis to generate dietary estimates.
They discovered that dogs of 7,000-8,000 years ago  “were already quite small, meaning that they just couldn’t do the things that most wolves were doing,” said Losey.
This in turn led to greater dependence on humans for food, and reliance on small prey and scavenging, rather than prey bigger than themselves, which wolves hunt.
“We see that dogs have marine diets, meaning they’re eating fish, shellfish, seals and sea lions, which they can’t easily get themselves,” he said.
Ancient dogs were found to be eating fish  “in areas of Siberia where the lakes and rivers are frozen over for seven to eight months of the year.” Wolves of the time, and today, were hunting in packs and mainly eating various species of deer.
Benefits and challenges 
These new diets brought dogs both benefits and challenges.
“Beneficial because they could access stuff from humans, and those are oftentimes easy meals, but it came with the costs of all these new diseases and problems, like not enough nutrition,” said Losey.
While the new bacteria and parasites they were exposed to could have helped some adapt, some dog populations might not have survived.
Most of the first dogs of the Americas died out, for unclear reasons, and were replaced by European dogs -- though it’s not thought colonization was to blame.
Those dogs that did survive acquired more diverse gut microbiomes, helping them further in digesting more carbohydrates associated with life with humans.

A letter released from the White House physician, Kevin O’Connor, said the President ran a slight temperature of 37.4 C on Thursday night, but he responded favourably to Tylenol and that he was breathing normally.
“His voice is deeper this morning. His pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation remain normal, on room air,” he said.
White House Covid coordinator Dr Ashish Jha told CNN that Joe Biden was doing fine and that his mild symptoms were basically the same. He has a runny nose, fatigue and occasional dry cough, said O’Connor.
Biden tested positive for Covid on Thursday, when the White House said he was experiencing mild symptoms and would continue working but in isolation.
On Friday, as the White House sought to convey a sense of normalcy, it released another photo of Biden signing legislation a day earlier wearing a black mask.
O’Connor said two medicines that Biden takes, Eliquis for atrial fibrillation and cholesterol drug Crestor, are being held back temporarily to avoid interfering with his treatment course of the antiviral drug Paxlovid. He said low-dose aspirin is being added to Biden’s treatment as an alternative blood thinner.
“The president is tolerating treatment well,” he said.
Biden, who at 79 is the oldest person ever to serve as president of the United States, is due to hold three virtual meetings with his staff this weekend, including his economic, legislative and national security aides.
