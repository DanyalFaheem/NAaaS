1,"Assembly amends law to regulate, manage forests in tribal districts","Opposition MPA raises objection, asks why certain exemptions for ex-Fata and not Malakand","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Forest (Amendment) Bill, 2022, was passed by the provincial assembly on Friday to extend the existing Forest Ordinance, 2002, with amendments to tribal districts for the regulation and management of the local forests.
Under the amended act, Schedule III has been included in the existing forest ordinance that shall apply to tribal districts for a period of 10 years. 
The existing forest resources have been divided in several categories, including forests, private forests, jointly managed communal forests and socially managed forests.
A senior official said that the forest department had been given management role to regulate and protect forests in tribal districts and the department concerned would carry out plantation and other activities for the conservation of forests.

Opposition MPA raises objection, asks why certain exemptions for ex-Fata and not Malakand

Under the amended act he said ownership of the forests including natural forests in the erstwhile Fata would lie with the local tribes and communities. 
“The forest department will provide technical support to the local communities for the better management of the forests and will carry out plantation,” he said, adding that the amended act based on the local customs and traditions of the tribes.
Sources insisted that the amended act was designed after taking all stakeholders, including tribal elders and communities, on board.
They said that jirgas were organised in all tribal districts and consultations were held with stakeholders.
Former Fata was merged with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through a constitutional in 2018; however, the forest ordinance was not extended to the area.
Prior to the merger, local tribes protect forests through local customs like Bandahr, Salwaishtai and Quomi-Tarun.
MPA of the opposition Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal Inayatullah Khan expressed reservations about the amendment and asked environment minister Syed Ishtiaq Urmer to explain ‘crux’ of the amendment before its passage.
He said the people of Malakand division had also some forest-related issues, so the relevant minister should give reasons for granting certain exemptions to tribal districts and not Malakand.
The lawmaker also said if the government decided to declare an area the national park, it should also specify how the park would help protect the rights of the local communities.
The minister told the house that the basic aims of the amendments to the forest ordinance were to enhance fines for different forest related offences in the province, control violations of the act, and protect forest resources.
Section 3 of the Schedule III reads, “The ownership of the forests, private forests, jointly managed communal forests and socially managed forests shall vest with the individual concernedor local communities, Quoam, Khels, Sub-Khels etc, as per taqsim. 
However, they shall be managed in a collaborative manner through Joint Forest Management Mechanism or local traditional committees by the relevant individual, families or community/communities and the department as per provision of this schedule.”
According to Section 4, the government may also regulate and manage any or all forests, private forests, jointly managed communal forests and socially managed forests or wastelands and watershed areas, which are owned by private persons, individually or jointly, and which is not the property of the government or over which the government has no proprietary rights.
The new law says illicit cutting, sawing, converting, obtaining, storing, selling, transporting, removal of trees and timber and the collection, manufacture and removal of forest produce from these forests and the use of any tools, implements, carriages, boats, vehicles, pack-animals, conveyances, power saw and sawing unit will be prohibited in all categories of forests mentioned in Schedule III.
According to the new law any person, who violates the provision of this schedule or who illegally cuts, debarks and damage to roots of any species, mentioned in Clause 6 of Paragraph II, within the limits of the government land or any forest under the management of divisional forest officer in tribal districts, shall be treated as offence, which shall be punished under sections 84 and 85 of the Ordinance.
There will be a dispute resolution committee. 
In case any dispute arises between the stakeholders of rights of any forests, the matter shall be referred to the DRC, which shall consist of the relevant deputy commissioner (chairman), DFO and representatives or elders, each from five quoam, three khels and one sub-khels to be appointed by chairman on the recommendation of the relevant conservator (forests).
The law says that all commercial harvesting of forests, private forests, jointly managed communal forests and socially managed forests shall be subject to the approval of management plan. 
The timber, harvested from any of forests, managed under working plan or timber, so confiscated, shall be put to auction in central sale depots, notified by the government.

9,PHC denies bail in drug case,Declares has no jurisdiction on matter as appeal pending with SC,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has turned down the plea of a man to suspend the life sentence awarded to him by the trial court for drug trafficking and to grant him bail until the disposal of his appeal pending before the Supreme Court.
While dismissing petition of Doctor Khan, a bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim ruled that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain bail in a case in which appeal against its judgement was pending with the Supreme Court.
The petitioner has challenged a judgement of the high court of June 29, 2016, whereby his appeal against his conviction was rejected, before the Supreme Court by filing a leave to appeal petition. The apex court had granted him leave to appeal on Oct 21, 2021.
The petitioner/ convict was arrested by personnel of Hangu City police station on March 24, 2013, while he was driving a truck. He was also accompanied by Javed Iqbal.

Declares has no jurisdiction on matter as appeal pending with SC

The police claimed that they had a tip-off about the smuggling of contraband, so they stopped that truck and seized 113kg charas.
The petitioner and Javed Iqbal were convicted by the trial court on April 2, 2014, and were awarded life imprisonment and a fine of Rs500,000 each.
Both convicts had filed appeals against the verdict with the high court.
While the appeal of Doctor Khan was dismissed, the high court accepted the plea of Javed leading to his acquittal on Sept 29, 2016.
Doctor Khan moved the Supreme Court with a leave to appeal petition, which is still pending decision.
The high court bench observed that it derived its power to grant bail pending appeal before the Supreme Court against the judgement of this court in a criminal case from 426 (2B) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The bench observed that the said provision was enacted in 1946, which provided that where a high court was satisfied that a convicted person has been granted special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against any sentence which it has imposed or maintained, it may, if it so thinks fit order that pending the appeal the sentence or order appealed against be suspended and also, if the said person is in confinement, that he be released on bail.
The bench further observed that after independence of India and Pakistan, being alive to the situation, the Indian Law Commission recommended in 1969 that the said provision needed to be omitted from the statute following which the Indian Criminal Procedure Code was amended.
Furthermore, the bench pointed out that the Supreme Court had taken care of the matter in question while framing its rules under Article 191 of the Constitution.
The bench referred to Rule 11 in Chapter-XXII of the Supreme Court of Pakistan Rules, 1980, which states: “Pending the disposal of any appeal under this Order the Court may order that the execution of the sentence or order appealed against be stayed on such terms as the court my think fit.”
The bench after giving ruling in a case had no official authority to entertain it until and unless it could be shown why a petition for the suspension of the sentence could not be lodged in the first instance before the Supreme Court.
The court ruled that when the Supreme Court had already taken cognisance of the matter and while this court had already dismissed the appeal and had maintained the conviction recorded by the trial court; and when there was no legal impediment in the way of the petitioner to approach the apex court, the bench deemed it not proper to suspend the sentence awarded to the petitioner.
