0,ECP finalises delimitation list for LG polls in capital,Each union council will have six general wards and two women wards.,"ISLAMABAD: The delimitation committee of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has finalised initial delimitation list of constituencies for local government (LG) elections in Islamabad.
According to the ECP, the committee finalised initial delimitation list of 101 union councils. It said that each union council will have six general wards and two women wards.
The ECP said that objections and suggestions on initial lists of delimitation of union councils could be submitted from July 23 to August 7. 
According to the ECP, the election commissioner Rawalpindi has been appointed as delimitation authority, who will hear suggestion and objections on the initial list.  
The election body said the delimitation authority will dispose of objections by Aug 22 and final list of union councils and wards will be published on Aug 26. The local government elections were supposed to be held on July 31 on 50 union councils. 
However, PML-N and PPP filed a case in the Islamabad High Court pleading that numbers of union councils should be increased from 50 to 101, therefore, elections should be deferred for the time being. To this, the court directed the ECP last month for fresh delimitation and now the initial list has been finalised.
After finalising the delimitation process, the ECP will issue new election schedule. 
The local government completed its five-year term in February 2021 and elections were slated to be held within three months, but were not as the PTI government wanted to get the polls conducted on the basis of a new delimitation.

2,Another fake plot allotment scam hits CDA,"Probe to be started against officials involved in allotment of seven plots in D-13 with fake signatures, says official.","ISLAMABAD: Another scandal of alleged fake allotment of plots has hit the Capital Development Authority (CDA) as the security directorate of the civic agency has unearthed fraudulent allotment of seven plots in D-13.
Sources said a few months ago, the then additional director land Sobia Toru, who is currently serving as the deputy commissioner CDA, informed the security directorate that two plots in D-13 had been allotted with her fake signatures.
The sources said when the matter was brought into the notice of CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed, he directed the security directorate to conduct a probe to reach the truth and expose officials involved in it.
During the preliminary probe, it transpired that at least seven such plots had been allotted with fake signatures. The probe committee also pointed out that the plots were allotted against fake claims of land as the allottees had no land in Shah Allah Ditta but were allotted alternate plots using fake claims.

Probe to be started against officials involved in allotment of seven plots in D-13 with fake signatures, says official

The sources added that files of the seven plots were also missing from the land directorate. The committee, which completed a preliminary inquiry, recommended to the CDA management to issue orders for cancellation of the plots and hold a formal inquiry.
A couple of months ago, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had also sought the record of the two plots in D-13, which were initially reported to the security directorate by the former additional director land.
The security directorate, a few years ago, had also confiscated alleged bogus records of seven plots in I-12 from the One-Window Operation (OWO) centre minutes before their transfers.
Later, the cases were referred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) but so far the first information report (FIR) has been lodged for just one case.
There are thousands of people whose land was acquired by the civic agency and they are entitled to get plots against it.
However, the civic agency after 2017 has not been providing plots to the affected landowners and this unofficial ban on allotment of plots to them may be creating opportunities for corrupt officials to take advantage.
A number of cases have been filed in lower courts and even before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against CDA by people whose land was acquired by the authority.
“For ending corruption and corrupt practices, the CDA should clear all pending cases for land affectees for good. Otherwise, such fraud cases will continue taking place as several officials have their roots in CDA’s land directorate and OWP,” said an official of the CDA.
When contacted, a senior officer of the CDA confirmed to Dawn on Friday that during the preliminary probe it had transpired that seven plots were allotted fraudulently. He said soon an order will be issued for starting a formal inquiry for fixing responsibility.

3,IHC orders incumbent Peira chairperson’s de-notification,ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday set aside the appointment of Zia Batool as chairperson of Private...,"ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday set aside the appointment of Zia Batool as chairperson of Private Educational Institutions Regulatory Authority(Peira).
IHC Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, while deciding the petition of former member (Peira) Imtiaz Ali Qureshi, ordered the federal government to de-notify Ms Batool forthwith. According to Mr Qureshi, Ms Batool did not possess the degree required to apply for the post advertised in 2019.
Ms Batool was appointed in October 2019 by the education ministry for a three-year term on the MP-II Scale. Mr Qureshi alleged that Ms Batool was appointed in sheer violation of rules.
He stated in the petition that the qualification notified in the advertisement for the recruitment of the Peira head was a master’s degree in Education Planning and Management, Public Administration/MBA, Law or PhD and MPhil in these subjects or allied subjects.
He claimed that the chairperson held a master’s degree in agriculture economics from the University of Faisalabad, which according to him did not fall in the category required for the appointment.
It is clearly evident that Ms Zia Batool does not possess basic requisite qualification for eligibility to even apply for the post of chairman of the authority. 
Therefore, his appointment has been made in violation of rules and selection criteria and hence terminable forthwith, he pointed out in his petition.
He made several other allegations against the chairperson.
Justice Kayani noted that despite repeated court orders, the authorities did not provide a copy of Ms Batool’s educational credentials, since these went missing.
He ordered the Establishment Division to hold an inquiry into her missing educational record and sought a report in three months. 
As per court orders, the case might be remanded to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in case the committee found any irregularity.

The budget was approved by Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal as administrator of RMC. It is the first budget of the city after change of the local government system.
A senior RMC official told Dawn that for the last two years, the RMC did not spend a single penny on uplift projects even with Rs3.5 billion in its account. 
He said there was no chance that the civic body would work on any development scheme this year too and it made no effort to make a plan in this regard in the absence of an elected person.

Commissioner approves annual budget for 2022-23

The total outlay of the budget is Rs6.1 billion; Rs4.6 billion has been allocated for development while Rs1.4 billion for non-development expenditures.
According to budget documents, Rs522.4 million has been allocated for salaries of RMC employees, Rs500 million for pension of former employees, Rs365.5 million for contingency/services and commodities and Rs45 million for miscellaneous.
The RMC allocated Rs25 million for repair and maintenance of streets and roads, Rs15 million for building repair, Rs10 million for repair of streetlights and restoration of traffic signals.
In order to generate funds, the RMC has planned to convert its old office building located on Jinnah Road into a parking plaza.
According to the budget, the RMC had eight sources of income and it would get Rs529 million from its share of the urban immovable property tax, Rs400 million from tax on transfer of immovable property, Rs325 million from its share of Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) award from the Punjab government, Rs600 million from fee for change of land, Rs100 million from building plan fee, Rs253 million from rent of the RMC properties, Rs120 million from profit of bank account and Rs343 million from slaughter house, general bus stand and parking fees.
Mr Mengal said that the RMC planned to utilise the development fund on major schemes as the road and streets had already been improved.
He said the monument of Benazir Bhutto at Liaquat Bagh and restoration of Sujan Singh Haveli and food street at Bhabara Bazaar will be main projects.
“Through this, the civic body will provide better a environment for tourists and visitors,” he said, adding that more parking plazas would be constructed to solve parking problems in the downtown area and visitors will get better travelling facilities on main roads. He said civic issues would also be solved in the next fiscal year.

6,AJK assembly vows to protect constitutional rights of Kashmiris,The rare consensus was demonstrated during a debate on an adjournment motion by former AJK prime minister Raja Farooq Haider.,"MUZAFFARABAD: Opposition and treasury benches in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Assembly on Friday vowed to resist any attempt aimed at divesting the liberated territory and its people of rights that they had gained through a landmark constitutional amendment some four years ago.
The rare consensus was demonstrated by them during a debate on an adjournment motion by PML-N leader and former AJK prime minister Raja Farooq Haider, wherein he took strong exception to a recent letter from the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs in which nomination of three representatives from the AJK government was sought for a subcommittee constituted to “examine and finalise the proposed draft of 15th amendment”.
“The letter has disregarded facts and attempts to undermine the honour of the legislative assembly. It has not only hurt the Kashmiris who have always braved India’s machinations but also runs the risk of creating misgivings between the Kashmiris and the government of Pakistan,” he said.
Mr Haider recalled that this house had “restored the constitutional, legal, financial and administrative authority of the AJK government in accordance with the spirit of parliamentary democracy and the aspirations of Kashmiris” through the 13th amendment in June 2018.
He made it clear that as long as AJK remained in existence with the existing special status, struggle for freedom of occupied territory would continue with vigour.
Most of his views were endorsed not only by Sardar Hassan Ibrahim of Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party and Bazil Ali Naqvi of Pakistan Peoples Party from the opposition benches, but also by Minister for Education Deevan Ali Chughtai, Minister for Local Government Khawaja Farooq Ahmed and some other treasury members.

The public relations officers (PROs) have also been made responsible to counter news items which the officers considered negative and propaganda against the police.   
The order for the setting up of the PRB wasissued by Inspector General of Police (IGP) Akbar Nasir Khan.  
It said: “Selected media persons shall be honoured every time they contribute for positive public perception opinion on any forum during the month.”  
Objectives of the PRB included countering fake news and negative reporting about issues of public interest related to public safety, security and policing, positive image building of the police and improving the public perception of police through factual information sharing.  
The deputy inspector general (DIG) of police headquarters will head the PRB and report to the police chief. Besides, public relations offices (DPROs) will be established in all divisions of the capital police under the direct supervision of their head.  
Female police officers should be encouraged to participate in this branch as per their skill, it added.  
The PRB has also a PRO who reports directly to the DIG, the order said, adding the PRO is assisted by as many coordinators as needed at the CPO level and five DPROs for all the existing five divisions. The DPROs directly report to PRO and until fresh appointments resources will be provided by the relevant division to be selected and posted by the assistant PRO (APROs) after approval from the DIG headquarters.  
The DIG can be assisted by a suitable number of APROs which may be police officers, experts or specialists in various fields, the order said.
Besides, there are separate electronic media monitoring, print media, social media and production teams along with photographers in the branch.  
Approval of all information released on behalf of the police shall be granted by the PRO.  
The PRO will interact with producers, bureau chiefs and news heads of all channels and plan programmes, documentaries and other possible stuff regarding image building of the police.  
Responses to negative news and rebuttal should be given by the PRO or through his designated representative at the divisional level. Selected positive images and success stories of the police will be shared with all media forums.  
Monthly e-magazines about the success stories of the police will be developed and shared with the public through electronic and social media. Unauthentic and anti-police propaganda sites and platforms should be blocked or banned.  
Negative and baseless news related to the police appearing in print or electronic media will be reported to Pemra for necessary action after the approval by the PRO and the DIG. Propaganda and news related to the police on social media will be reported by the PRO to FIA cyber crime wing for further necessary action.  
The PRO shall also work for preparation of promotion campaigns, products, dramas, movies or other relevant content to achieve its objectives.

Officials related to the PRB should be rewarded with cash prizes and certificates on providing and sharing top success stories.  
The order said selected media persons shall be honoured every time they contribute for the positive public perception of the police on any forum.  
When the IGP was contacted and asked what he meant by negative reporting and from where the police would get funds for making dramas, moves etc., and give cash prize to the PRB members, he said: “Contact the PRO.”  
When approached, the PRO said it was a self-explanatory document and for internal consumption of the police. He said every journalist associated with print, electronic and social media was respectable for the police.  
“The core purpose of the document is to bridge the gap between police and the community through effective news reporting. Media has an integral role to play in that area,” he added.
