LAHORE: In a major setback for Pakistan, pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi on Saturday was ruled out of the upcoming T20 Asia Cup and the T20 home series against Engl­and as the medical panel has advised the bowler four to six weeks rest due to a right knee ligament injury he suffered during the Test series in Sri Lanka last month.
“Shaheen Shah Afridi has been advised 4-6 weeks rest by the PCB Medical Advisory Committee and independent specialists following [the] latest scans and reports. This means Shaheen has been ruled out of the ACC T20 Asia Cup and home series against England, but is expected to return to competitive cricket in October with the New Zealand T20I tri-series, which will be followed by the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Australia 2022,” a PCB press statement issued from Rotterdam, Holland stated.
Currently, the Pakistan squad is in Holland playing a three-match One-day Intern­a­tional series agai­n­st the hosts and left-armer Shah­een, despite carrying the inj­u­ry, was kept with the squad to continue his rehab and play any of the matches in case he regained full fitness.
In a message on social media, Shaheen said he will be back in action soon.
“Every  player of our playing XI is a match-winner,” he posted on Twitter.  “Wishing my team best of luck for upcoming Asia Cup. To the fans, keep  me in your prayers for my quick recovery. I’ll be back soon.”
The 22-year-old Shaheen, who has developed himself into a world-class pace bow­ler, has represented Paki­stan regularly in all three formats since bursting onto the world stage in 2018. Seldom the lanky cricketer has been rested for international duty.
He suffered the knee injury while fielding during the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle.
The six-nation Asia Cup is scheduled to be held in the UAE from Aug 27 to Sept 11. The continental event will be followed by a seven-match T20 International series betw­een Pakistan and Engl­and in Karachi and Lahore from Sept 20 to Oct 2.
Then the all-important ICC T20 World Cup will be staged in Australia from Oct 16 to Nov 13.
Meanwhile commenting on Shaheen, PCB’s chief medical officer, Dr Najeeb­ullah Soomro said the player would come back strongly.
“I have spoken with Shaheen and he is understandably upset with the news, but he is a brave young man who has vowed to come back strongly to serve his country and team. Although he has made progress during his rehabilitation in Rotte­rdam, it is now clear he will require more time and is likely to return to competitive cricket in October,” Dr Najeebullah said.
“PCB’s Sports & Exercise Medicine Department will be working closely with the player over the coming weeks to ensure his safe return to competitive cricket.”
Shaheen will stay with the squad in Rotterdam to complete the rehabilitation programme. His replacement for the T20 Asia Cup will be announced shortly.
The Pakistan squad after playing the third and final ODI against the Netherlands on Sunday, will arrive in Dubai from Rotterdam on Monday.
Being an integral part of the national team in all formats, Shaheen’s absence in all likelihood is going to benefit Pakistan’s opponents particularly India in the Asia Cup.
In the 2021 T20 World Cup, which was also held in the UAE, Shaheen had destroyed India’s top-order batting as Pakistan thrashed Virat Kohli and company by ten wickets — the greenshirts’ first-ever win over their traditional rivals in a World Cup game.
During the last few years, the premier trio of captain Babar Azam, Shaheen and wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan have played pivotal roles in Pakistan’s wins, particularly in T20 Internationals.
The pace and experience which Shaheen has gained in four years will create problems for the selectors to pick a suitable replacement of the Khyber Agency-born fast bowler.
Without Shaheen, Paki­stan’s pace attack looks weak. Though the likes of Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Naseem Shah, Mohammad Wasim and Mohammad Hasnain have done in patches, they are yet to create a significant impact, as Shaheen has consistently done, in cut-throat international contests.
It may be mentioned here that in the last presser,  Babar while responding to a question on managing the workload of himself, Shaheen and Rizwan, to avoid fitness problems, had said Shaheen was not unfit due to workload but was injured during fielding in the first Test at Galle.
“If a player has to play a lot of cricket, instead of reducing the workload he should increase his fitness level to meet the challenge,” was Babar’s reply at the presser.

Third-seeded Pakistan had overwhelmed arch-rivals India in their quarter-final tie on Friday but came unstuck against the Egyptians.

2,"Kane takes Spurs top, unsettled Leicester lose again",Manchester United remain bottom ahead of their huge clash against Liverpool on Monday.,"LONDON: Harry Kane’s 250th Tottenham Hotspur goal took Spurs to the top of the Premier League with a 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday as a 2-1 defeat to Southampton compounded Leicester City’s miserable start to the season.
If anyone is to rival Manchester City and Liverpool in the title race, Tottenham look well set after backing Antonio Conte heavily in the transfer market in his first full season in charge.
After a strong end to last season to snatch a place in the Champions League from north London rivals Arsenal, Tottenham have already taken seven more points than they got from their respective fixtures last season in the first three games of the new campaign.
However, Conte was still displeased with a sloppy first-half performance that could have been punished against more potent opponents.
New signings Goncalo Guedes and Matheus Nunes impressed for Wolves, but they have scored just once in three games this season as Guedes, Ruben Neves and Daniel Podence were guilty of failing to hit the target.
Spurs improved markedly after the break and got their reward when Kane bulleted home a header after Ivan Perisic flicked on Son Heung-min’s corner.
Kane’s 185th Premier League goal also set a record for the most scored by anyone for a single club, edging ahead of Sergio Aguero’s 184 for Manchester City.
“I said that if we repeat the same results as last season we stay after three games with zero points,” said Conte.  “Instead to get seven points showed that this team is improving in many aspects.”
At the other end of the table, Manchester United remain bottom ahead of their huge clash against Liverpool on Monday.
But Leicester are only one point better off after Che Adams came off the bench to score twice and further darken the mood around the King Power.
Wesley Fofana was left out of Brendan Rodgers’ squad as the Frenchman seeks to force through a move to Chelsea.
Leicester are the only Premier League club yet to spend any money in the transfer window, but may have to in the final 10 days of the window to ward off a difficult season.
James Maddison’s free-kick had put the Foxes in front, but Adams twice pounced on poor defending in the absence of Fofana to give Southampton their first win of the season.
The pressure is also back on Aston Villa manager Steven Gerrard after his side threw away a perfect start to lose 3-1 at Crystal Palace.
Ollie Watkins opened the scoring for the visitors at Selhurst Park after five minutes, but Wilfried Zaha quickly levelled.
Zaha then put Palace in front at the second attempt after his penalty was saved by Emiliano Martinez.
Jean-Philippe Mateta made the points safe 19 minutes from time.
Fulham remain unbeaten on their return to the top flight as Aleksandar Mitrovic’s powerful header won a thrilling west London derby against Brentford 3-2.
The home side stormed into a two-goal lead thanks to Bobby Decordova-Reid and Joao Palhinha, but for the second time this season Brentford fought back from 2-0 down through Christian Norgaard and Ivan Toney.
Mitrovic had the final say, though, when he rose highest to meet Kevin Mbabu’s cross to send Marco Silva’s men into fourth.
Everton secured their first point of the season thanks to Demarai Gray’s late equaliser to cancel 
out Brennan Johnson’s goal for free-spending Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw at Goodison Park.

3,Shanaka to lead Sri Lanka in Asia Cup,COLOMBO: Sri Lanka on Friday named a 20-man squad led by Dasun Shanaka for the Asia Cup T20 tournament starting ...,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka on Friday named a 20-man squad led by Dasun Shanaka for the Asia Cup T20 tournament starting later this month in the United Arab Emirates.
The tournament was originally scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka, but shifted to the UAE due to political turmoil and the economic crisis in the cricket-crazy island nation.
Sri Lanka has witnessed months of food and fuel shortages, blackouts and runaway inflation in the wake of its worst financial crisis on record.
Sri Lanka play their opening match against Afghanistan in Dubai on Aug 27. The final takes place on Sept 11, also in Dubai.
Squad: Dasun Shanaka (captain), Dhanushaka Gunathilaka, Pathum Nissanka, Kusal Mendis, Charith Asalanka, Banuka Rajapaksha, Ashen Bandara, Dhananjaya de Silva, Wanidu Hasaranga, Mahesh Theekshana, Jeffery Vandersay, Praveen Jayawickrema, Dushmantha Chameera, Binura Fernando, Chamika Karunaratne, Dilshan Madushanka, Matheesha Pathirana, Dinesh Chandimal, Nuwanindu Fernando and Kasun Rajitha.

4,Thakur-inspired India cruise to ODI series win against Zimbabwe,"""I think I have good skillsets, so I just need to keep polishing those in the nets,"" Thakur says.","HARARE: Seamer Shardul Thakur took 3-38 as India completed a five-wicket win over Zimbabwe to claim victory in their three-match One-day International series with a game to spare here at the Harare Sports Club on Saturday.
After electing to bowl, India dismissed the home side for 161 before chasing down their target with 24.2 overs remaining in another comfortable win to follow Thur­sday’s victory by 10 wickets at the same venue.
All six Indian bowlers took wickets, but it was Thakur who stood out as he dismissed opener Innocent Kaia (16), captain Regis Chakabva (2) and Luke Jongwe (6) with some excellent swing bowling.
Sean Williams was the top scorer for Zimbabwe with a run-a-ball 42, while Ryan Burl was left stranded not out on 39 at the end of the innings.
“Early on it was a little on the slower side, but later we could bowl more bouncers,” Thakur said.  “What I can improve on is to guess where the batsman is going to attack me and bowl accordingly.
“I think I have good skillsets, so I just need to keep polishing those in the nets. Sometimes you just need to hit the deck hard and keep it tight.”
India lost captain KL Rahul (1) early in their reply, while the heroes from the first game, Shikhar Dhawan and Shubman Gill, both scored 33 but could not repeat their unbeaten half-centuries from two days earlier.
Deepak Hooda (25) and Sanju Samson (43 not out) put on 56 for the fifth wicket to see India to within sight of their target.
The third and final ODI will be played at the same venue on Monday.—Reuters

The 24-year-old managed scores of nine and 13 at Lord’s where South Africa triumphed by an innings and 12 runs inside three days to grab a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.
Crawley is now without a half-century in his last 14 innings and his unflattering Test average of 26 has prompted questions about his place in the squad.
“The problem Zak Crawley has is that we haven’t had the upside to go with the downside,” former England captain Andrew Strauss told Sky Sports.
“It feels like his game is a bit skewed at the moment.
“He doesn’t understand the high-risk from the low-risk options. From what we have seen, he is not at ease with his game or his place in the team either.”

6,Nortje grateful for Elgar’s ‘honesty’,LONDON: South African fast bowler Anrich Nortje paid tribute to captain Dean Elgar’s  “honesty” after the...,"LONDON: South African fast bowler Anrich Nortje paid tribute to captain Dean Elgar’s  “honesty” after the Proteas’ innings and 12-run rout of England in the first Test at Lord’s.
Nortje finished with match figures of 6-110 as South Africa completed a crushing victory inside three days in London to go 1-0 up in a three-match series.
The 28-year-old express quick was especially effective after lunch on Friday, taking three wickets for no runs in 10 balls to have Jonny Bairstow, Alex Lees and Ben Foakes all caught behind as he repeatedly topped speeds of 90mph (145kph) and even surpassed 95mph at one stage.
There was no way back for England, who were dismissed for 149 in under 38 overs, with South Africa’s bowlers effectively giving themselves some unexpected, but valuable, extra rest ahead of Thursday’s second Test at Manchester’s Old Trafford.
South Africa were already top of the World Test Championship table before this game and they have now won eight of their 10 matches at this level since experienced opening batsman Elgar became their permanent captain in red-ball cricket last year.
“Dean is quite straight forward,” Nortje told reporters after stumps.
“If he thinks you’re not playing your A-game, he’ll tell you and the whole team respects that. We need that. You need someone to tell you and not to beat around the bush.”
Nortje, who occasionally got carried away with short-pitched bowling at Lord’s before reverting to a fuller length, added:  “He will tell you if it is not good enough and at stages that is what happened.
“At stages he thought what I was doing is the right thing and he encourages me to bring energy and bowl quick because that’s my job — to bowl quick, to try to bring energy and momentum for the team.
“It paid off here and hopefully it pays off again but he does encourage me to try to express myself as a bowler,” Nortje explained.
“I am really enjoying having him as a captain and it is nice to have that honesty from a captain as well.”
Nortje has taken 53 wickets in his 13 Tests at an average of exactly 27, having spent six months on the sidelines nursing back and hip injuries following last year’s T20 World Cup.
But he now finds himself back in Test action as a member of a formidable four-man pace attack that also includes spearhead Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and towering left-armer Marco Jansen.
The quartet were all in the wickets at Lord’s, with Rabada’s superb 5-62 in England’s meagre first innings 165, where Nortje offered good support with 3-63, leading the way.
“It is an unbelievable attack and guys have shown what they can do,” said Nortje.
“Everyone covers a different aspect in their own department and it is just really nice to be joining up and playing red-ball cricket with the team again.
“KG [Rabada] did unbelievably well for us in this game as well,” Nortje remarked.

The main event, the August Cup — a class VII division I and II combined handicap race to be contested over 1000 metres, has  a field of only  seven  runners but all are pedigreed thoroughbreds. Bay filly, Queen’s Gambit, the bay colt Lucky Sohna and the bay Drums Of War look good on recent form and a good rider and a the draw will be the deciding factor.
The other two cup events are named after the former champion jockeys — Shahid Rehman and Salah-ud-Din in recognition of their outstanding performances on racing tracks.
The Shahid Rehman Cup has eight runners of whom a trio of Master Prince, Chan Pari and Safdar Princess look the main contenders.
The Salahuddin Cup has  ten runners. The real contest is expected between One Ten, Hard Target and Umer Princess.
Dark-bay colt, Khareef One, bay colt Pride Of Chanrai, bay Gelding Danial Prince and bay colt Wonder Boy are in the reckoning for a close fight in the first race. The duo of bay horses Sixty Love and Zaman Sahib look the main contenders in the fifth race while  bay horse Wind Talker looks a good bet in the sixth and the last race.
In all, 46 acceptors will take part in six races. All races will be contested over the sprinting distance of 1000 metres with the horses in the first race to come under the starter’s order at 5.00pm.

Madrid outfit Rayo held Barcelona to a stalemate at the Nou Camp last week, and on Friday Andoni Iraola’s high energy side took all three points from Barca’s city-rivals.
Isi Palazon smacked home the opener from outside the box on 40 minutes, while Senegalese midfielder Pathe Ciss tapped home from a corner on the hour to make it 2-0.
Rayo defender Florian Lejeune was sent off after just 16 minutes after a second yellow card in two minutes, while Espanyol defender Sergio Gomez was red carded for a violent foul on the half hour.
Iraola brought on veteran Radamel Falcao as a late substitute and while lively, was twice caught offside. Espanyol’s Javier Puado hit the post to be denied a consolation goal in the closing exchanges.
Promoted Real Valladolid were just minutes from a first win over Sevilla in 10 years but had to settle for a 1-1 draw.
Anuar gave Valladolid an 80th-minute lead but Karim Rekik equalised six minutes later.
The result gave both sides a first point of the season after Sevilla lost their opener 2-1 at Osasuna and Valladolid were beaten 3-0 by Villarreal.

Top seed Medvedev fired 18 aces among 30 winners in a 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 defeat of Taylor Fritz in their quarter-final.
Tsitsipas, semi-finalist at the last two editions, weathered a brief first-set rain interruption on the way to his 7-6 (7-5), 5-7, 6-3, defeat of John Isner, playing here for the 15th time at age 37 and the oldest quarter-finalist since 1969.
In the bottom half of the draw, Croat Borna Coric crushed Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 6-4 to set up a semi-final against Britain’s Cameron Norrie,who had to work for more than three hours for a 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (4-7), 6-4 defeat of Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz.
The tight battle ended just before midnight as Norrie completed what he called one of his best career wins.
He stumbled leading a set and 4-1 as Alcaraz pushed back, winning the second set to level the match.
“I was thinking too much about the finish line,” the winner said.  “I got tight and he raised his level.
“I had to take my time or the match could have gotten away from me...I managed to turn it around.”
Medvedev, the 2019 tournament winner, strengthened his grip on the world number one ranking at the last major tune-up prior to the US Open, earning his victory over 11th seed Fritz in one hour, 40 minutes.
“The second set was much better than the first,” Medvedev said.  “Taylor is a great player, from the baseline he didn’t give you much space.  “He was hitting the ball strong, making a lot of good points.
“But I’m happy with my level. If I can continue to play this way and raise my level during matches I can beat anybody,” added Medvedev, who leads semi-final opponent Tsitsipas 7-2 in head-to-head meetings.
In the women’s quarter-finals, Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina saved three match points before falling 6-2, 6-4 to Madison Keys.
The Kazakh, who lifted the All England Club trophy last month against the odds, exited the pre-US Open event in 92 minutes as she went down to the American titleholder from 2019.
“Elena is a remarkable player who can turn a match around at any moment,” unseeded Keys said.  “I needed to stay out front.
“It felt like I needed 12 match points, so I’m very happy to get the win,” added Keys who on Thursday ousted world number one Iga Swiatek.
Keys next plays Petra Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion who defeated Australian qualifier Ajla Tomljanovic 6-2, 6-3.
Second seed Aryna Sabalenka ended the dream run of Zhang Shuai with a 6-4, 7-6 (7-1), defeat after the Chinese player had put out Naomi Osaka and second seed Anett Kontaveit.
Sabalenka plays for the final against qualifier Caroline Garcia, who defeated American Jessica Pegula, the winner over US Open champion Emma Raducanu in the previous round, 6-1, 7-5 in 74 minutes.
The French winner leads the Tour with 25 main-draw victories since June; she was the first from her nation to play a Cincinnati quarter-final since Marion Bartoli 12 years ago.

Ijaz reckoned Pakistan’s top-ranked player Ummam had a great chance of winning the Junior Asian title along with compatriots hailing from District Swat including Shah Khan (Pakistan No.2) and Abbas Khan (No.3).

After Finn Allen’s 96 anchored the Black Caps to 212 off 48.2 overs batting first on another challenging pitch, Southee and Bolt claimed three wickets apiece as the home side limped to 63 for seven off 22.4 overs when a second heavy shower resulted in a prolonged delay to the day/night fixture.
Set a revised target of 212 off 41 overs on the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern scoring method, Yannic Cariah’s 52 in his debut ODI innings and a swashbuckling 49 off 31 balls by Alzarri Joseph gave the tourists a fright in a frenetic 85-run ninth-wicket partnership.
However, Southee was summoned by stand-in captain Tom Latham and he responded immediately by bowling Joseph while Allen completed an excellent boundary catch to end Cariah’s effort as the West Indies were eventually dismissed for 161 off 35.3 overs to lose by 50 runs and set the stage for the series decider on Sunday.
Southee’s final figures were four for 19 while Boult’s six-over spell at the start of the innings earned him three for 18.
Earlier, opening batsman Allen’s effort off 117 balls with seven fours and three sixes was one of just four double-figure innings as the Black Caps, beaten in the first match by five wickets at the same venue two days earlier, were again found wanting against the home side’s combination of spin and pace.
“I’ve always known I’ve got the grit in me but I never showed it. Showing now that I can do it is good,” said Allen on receiving the ‘Man of the Match’ award.
“The wickets haven’t been batting-friendly but I have enjoyed the challenge.”
In just his second ODI, off-spinner Kevin Sinclair claimed four for 41, including the last three wickets, terminating a last-wicket stand of 31 between Mitchell Santner and Boult with a catch off his own bowling to dismiss Boult.
Former captain Jason Holder set the tone for the innings with an excellent opening spell, the fast-medium bowler snaring two early wickets and then returning to end Allen’s quest for the hundred in finishing with three for 24 off nine overs.
“It’s disappointing to lose so many wickets in the powerplay,” said West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran in reflecting on the opening period of his team’s reply when they slumped to 27 for six.
“Just one good partnership in the top order might have been enough to see us home.”
