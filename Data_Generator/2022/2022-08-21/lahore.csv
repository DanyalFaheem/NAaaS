6,Lahore’s Kitab Ghar – more than a library,"There are about 15 people from Pakistan and abroad who regularly contribute to the library funds, project head says.","Tucked behind shops in the Rehmanpura locality of Ichhra, a narrow street houses Kitab Ghar, a public library and a citizen initiative, launched by a group of eight young friends. 
The group of friends thought of the project and started working on it in November last year in a three-room portion of a house, which was in pretty bad condition. The organisers rehabilitated and renovated the rooms in the next couple of months to give it a funky look and launched a library.  
Bilal Mushtaq, one of the two coordinators who have been employed to work for the library, guides Dawn through the three rooms, one having a set of chairs and table while the other having carpet and cushions. There is a courtyard outside where literary and cultural activities are held when needed.  
A young man from Balochistan is preparing notes for his Balochistan Public Service Commission exams. He considers the library a blessing for him as he could prepare for his exams in a peaceful atmosphere near his residence. His other option was to go to the Quaid-i-Azam Library in Lawrence Gardens, which took time while fares had also increased. Another young man is busy reading in the other room. 
Two main rooms have got books in the carefully fixed shelves along the wall. One room has English language books while the other is reserved for Urdu and Punjabi books. The books are on diversified topics but most of them are of literature.  
“A group of eight friends first thought of opening a library and they implemented their idea this year. The library was launched in January,” says Ameer Hamza Khan, the head of the project. The library was launched on a self-help basis and funding from contributors.  
“In the first month of the launch (January), an amount of Rs72,000 was raised and in March, the funding touched Rs100,000 mark,” he says.  
In April too, the library raised Rs100,000, including Rs63,000 from monthly contributions and Rs34,000 from different initiatives. In July, the funding touched the Rs200,000 mark. The details of the funding were shared publicly through the social media pages of the library. 
“There are about 15 people from Pakistan and abroad who regularly contribute to the library funds with Rs5,000 or more monthly contributions on a regular basis,” says Khan. 
At the start, he adds, there were fewer books in the library but the number increased by and by. Literary events like meet-the-author and book launches and cultural events like film screening started happening there and it started growing from there. The literary events and talks are held under Jadeed Adabi Baithak where weekly discussions have been held on the masters of Urdu literature such as Krishan Chander, Ismat Chughtai, Manto and Rajinder Singh Bedi.  
Now the library has 2,000 books. Most of them have been donated by the people and donation of the books started with the founders; however, some books are bought through funds as well, Khan says. 
“The library offers language learning courses also. It started with a Punjabi language course but later Urdu and Hindu language courses were also organised. A part of money collected through language classes goes to library funds while the rest is paid to the teacher,” says Khan.  
On Aug 14, the library hosted a documentary on the Partition of India. In July, it held a discussion with volunteers of Aurat March. An eight-week long course was launched in June on the ‘history of others in Pakistan’. A talk was held with Punjabi poet Sabir Ali Sabir in April on spiritualism, Punjabi and modernism under the Jadeed Adabi Baithak initiative.  
“The membership of the library has increased. Anybody can become a member by paying Rs500 monthly but those who can’t afford to pay that amount can pay whatever amount he/she can afford,” says Khan, who adds that those who are not members of the library can still come and use it for reading. They can’t get the books issued and take them home. 
Ameer Hamza Khan has also developed a software for cataloguing the books of the library and its website. 
Asked why the library site (Rehmanpura, Ichhra) was selected for launching the library, he says it is a citizens initiative launched for the welfare of the local population. The area of Rehmanpura is densely populated and it needed a library. There is a hostel for boys just along the library and lots of young men living in the hostel use the library too. Anybody who is not a member of the library can come in it, sit there and read for free. Now the AC has also been installed while there is UPS already available in case of power outages. 
“To coordinate with the members and visitors, Kitab Ghar has engaged about 25 to 30 young volunteers from universities. They remain in the library three hours a week. There are more volunteers in vacation or when semesters are off in the universities,” Khan says. 
Dawn met two girl students of the Beaconhouse National University, who were volunteering as coordinators at the library. They work at the library once a week while different pairs of volunteers remain present in the library throughout the day.  
“The rent of the building is quite high; however, the funding is on the rise. We have decided to expand the library by taking more adjacent rooms on rent,” says Khan.

A number of PKI Khalid Khokhar group farmers gathered at Nawan Shehr Chowk and marched towards the press club to hold a demonstration against the government for failing to check electricity and urea prices. The farmers also held a symbolic funeral of agriculture in the country.  
Khokhar told the protestors that around 70 per cent of the people of the country belonged directly or indirectly to the farming community but the government was not providing any relief to them. He said the farmers were being charged Rs45 per unit in the current electricity bills and they would have to pay an increased cost of electricity bill from Rs50,000 to 250,000.  
He said they were not able to pay the bills and would not be able to cultivate wheat in the upcoming season.  
Khokhar further said the cost of fertiliser also increased and it was not feasible for them to cultivate wheat in the next season and they would stop farmers from cultivating wheat. He said already the government had increased the cost of diesel and now the electricity unit had been increased.  
He said they would soon march on Islamabad and would offer a Qul for agriculture outside the prime minister’s office and they would also send invitations to the state and government functionaries, parliamentarians and Imran Khan to attend the Qul.  
Khokhar said the government had imported Rs16 billion wheat and if they would not cancel the price of electricity, the farmers would not cultivate wheat and the government would have to import more wheat from the world. He said DAP and urea fertilisers prices had been increased and the farmers would not be able to use it to get better yield of the crops.  
He said no one knew the challenges of the farmers and they would not pay a single penny of the increased electricity bills.

The play was staged by the artistes from Islamabad for two days on Friday and Saturday.
Written and directed by Dr. Muhammad Waqar Azeem, the three-act play was a strong comment on the curse of feudalism. Produced by Iftikhar Ahmed, it was a Production of KN International in collaboration with Global Peace and Harmony.
The story of the play was about a feudal lord Jahanzeb Solangi who considered a woman nothing but a tool. Solangi’s wife Zohra also belongs to a feudal family but still Jahanzeb does not allow her to speak in his affairs and often curses her for being childless.  
The story begins with the character named Rashem, who is actually a spirit that wanders around the mansion and only Jahanzeb sees her and he is often frightened when he sees her. Rashem was actually the mistress of Jahanzeb’s father Wade Sai and she was killed by Wade Sai many years ago. The story goes on and talks about the curse of feudalism and how this kind of system has crept into the roots of the society.  
A good number of audiences came to see the play. The actors performed well. The actors included Noman Arshed, Shazina Sumaira, Aslam Mughal, Maheen Ali, Iftikhar Ahmed and Shazia Shaikhy. The music and light effects were effectively used in the play.

10,Harking back: Bengalis who came with the British to rule us,"Many eons ago when we lived near Saddar Bazaar in the Lahore Cantonment, one noticed that most markets and roads had...","Many eons ago when we lived near Saddar Bazaar in the Lahore Cantonment, one noticed that most markets and roads had Bengal-origin names. My assumption then of East Pakistani roots proved incorrect. Research showed them of 1850 origin.
As I researched the subject it became clear that in the 1857 War of Independence, this is where the most killings of ‘sepoys’ from Bengal took place. But then all the Bengal Native Infantry regiments lived here, or nearby. The first Officers Colony in Saddar is where they first shot dead two British officials, a Major and a doctor. So in this piece let me dwell on the story of Saddar and the coming of the Bengali elites who served the East India Company.  
When the Punjab Sikh kingdom was overthrown and the East India Company officially took over on the 29th of March, 1849, British colonial expansion in the sub-continent was complete. This was also the beginning of a great social change in Lahore, and Punjab. With the coming of the British a slow but sure societal change started, and those nearest to the East India Company moved into Lahore with their British overlords.
The very first Indians to take over the offices were a group of “educated westernised Bengalis”. The British had been in Bengal for over a 100 years and had cultivated an ‘elite class’ to serve them. The ruling elite were British, but the middle and lower order officers and clerks were invariably Bengalis. After all they had annexed Bengal in 1699 and appointed their very first Governor.
After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the Bengal Presidency was set up including Bihar, Orissa and Bengal with Calcutta as their first capital city. It was almost ‘magical’ the change as the researcher Denzil Ibbetson was to write. Suddenly, almost every office in Lahore was filled by Bengalis, with a few from Delhi who could speak Punjabi. This sudden societal change was reflected in the introduction of Urdu and English in legal undertakings. But the office work was handled by Bengalis who were fluent in English.  
The Saddar Bazaar of Lahore owes its origins to the Bengal Native Infantry regiments based in Lahore in 1850 and beyond. In the 1857 Uprising the 16th Grenadiers of the Bengal Native Infantry was disarmed in Lahore, as was the 26th Bengal Native Light Infantry. The same was the case of the 49th Regiment of the Bengal Native Infantry. Most of the soldiers who lived in Saddar Bazaar, or nearby, were shot dead, most trying to flee across the Ravi towards Delhi. Sadly, the Punjabi soldiers of the old Sikh regiments assisted the British. That we do not remember them, as we do not the Partition victims, is part of our ‘Claims Psyche’ as my late father used to say.
But the fact is that Lahore was full of Bengalis pre-1857, in the cantonment and in the civil area around Anarkali, after all that was the very first cantonment. Their numbers were fairly high and their influence considerable. But the influence of Bengal over Punjab was to grow in terms that a large number of educationists and missionaries who moved into Lahore and Punjab.
In Lahore, a Christian convert named Lala Radha Ram helped to set up the Lahore Religious Book Society within the outer compound of the emerging Punjab University facing Anarkali Bazaar. He was joined by another famous converted Christian Kali Charan Chatterjee, who soon managed to become a professor of mathematics of the Government College, Lahore. Later, he was made Director of the Forman Christian College, Lahore.
The good thing about Christianity was that inter-caste marriage was not discouraged, especially in a very liberal Lahore. Here we see the Christian Bengali community growing fast. A few names deserve to be mentioned. Miss Mona Bose was made Principal of the Government Girls College, Lahore, as was her sister Mrs Dutt who was a teacher. Her son Dr S.E. Dutt helped to set up the YMCA of Lahore, while his Bengali associate Prof. Radha moved on to join St, Stephen’s College, Delhi.
As the Bengali clerks and the educated religious-minded Christians established themselves firmly, we see the arrival of Bengali Hindus of the Brahmo community starting to move towards Lahore. The Bengali-led Brahmo Samaj started by spreading equally to other Punjab cities. But unlike the westernised Christians, the Hindu Brahmos insisted that other languages also be equally adopted.
In this regard as Dr G.W. Leitner was setting up Lahore’s Oriental College, they clashed over the issue, with the famous Leitner insisting that historical Indian languages get preference. The Brahmos contention was that Oriental College did not prepare students for government service. Leitner insisted that he wanted scholars not bureaucrats.
Among other prominent Bengalis of Lahore were Sivanath Shastri and Pratap Majumdar. So in a way a competition started between the emerging Punjabi English-speaking elite and the English-speaking officials from Bengal. If we study Ibbetson’s ‘Outlines of Punjab Ethnography’ we see that in the case of Bengali officials in Punjab they rose in 1881 from 2,891 officials to 4,852 by 1921, almost doubling in 40 years or a 25 per cent increase in every decade.
So a close competitive relationship between the Punjabis and Bengalis was visible. Here let me narrate a few persons in Punjab’s later history. The famous Bhagat Singh incident had a Punjabi and a Bengali Batukeshwar Dutt, as well as two others. We see over the years the revolutionaries of the freedom struggle were mostly from Bengal and Punjab.
For example, the Indian Resolution for Freedom, known as ‘Purna Swaraj’ was passed in Lahore’s Bradlaugh Hall on Rattigan Road in January 1930. But then so was Pakistan’s freedom resolution passed nearby in March 1940 at Minto Park. Amazingly both were first drafted by Bengali leaders.
But there are many other issues that one can explore, and they being how the Punjabi-led establishment refused to accept a fairly won election in 1971. This was to lead to a fatal breaking of ties and countries. Mind you Bengal and Punjab were the only two states that were partitioned in 1947.
The reason for this can be traced to the power these states held, and continue to hold. In Ranjit Singh’s days in a way Punjab was effectively divided into west and east portion. In 1905, the British rulers effectively partitioned Bengal into Muslim eastern Bengal and a Hindu western Bengal. This led to considerable trouble which was undone in 1911 thanks to the Swadeshi Movement.
Many scholars contend, and for good reason, that this was the real reason the All-India Muslim League was founded in 1906 by Bengalis in Muslim Dacca by Nawab Salimullah. But then again we see the partition of Bengal on religious lines in August 1947. Most scholars blame the British for promoting religious difference just as they had in Catholic Ireland against the minority Protestants. In Ireland, the Catholics won freedom. It seems the minority Protestants of Northern Ireland are these days slowly headed towards reunification.  
This year as both Pakistan and India celebrated 75 years of freedom, many scholars and researchers are seriously researching the history, social and economic, of Punjab and Bengal and of the entire partitioning episodes over time. It is a very complex puzzle that will, hopefully, one day be unfolded.
The role of beliefs have led to serious rational scientific education being discarded in both India and Pakistan. Rationality and faith in reason, not to speak of tolerance, will one day prevail. Till then we must all struggle for reason to prevail.

According to SZMCH Emergency Unit Deputy Medical Superintendent (DMS) Dr Farhana Khalid, she was performing her duty in the emergency paediatric ward when, DMS Dr Iqbal Malik, and some other doctors, finding her alone in her room, used abusive language against her.
Later, on the application of Dr Farhana, SZMCH Women Harassment Committee Chairperson  Dr Shazia Majid, Principal Medical Officer (PMO) Dr Mushtaq Azmi and Assistant Medical Superintendent (AMS) Dr Ambreen Bhatti probed into the matter and submitted the recommendations to the medical superintendent (MS) on May 26, 2022.  
The letter of recommendation reads: “It is stated that workplace harassment charge has been proved against Dr Iqbal Malik DMS Emergency.”  
The committee recommended that Dr Malik should be relieved from the institution, placing his services at the disposal of Specialized Health Care and Medical Education (SHC&ME) department as a minor penalty.  
It also recommended that Dr Farhana should also be relieved from emergency department as a minor penalty and she should not be given any administrative post in future.
The committee said Dr Amir Hameed, ex-director emergency, should be inquired under the PEEDA ACT because he was not monitoring departmental attendance register, rather he was involved in criminal activity of not reporting the absence of Dr Maria Ghaffar and Dr Aemen Samad, both EMOs of the Emergency Department.
The both women medical officers (WMOs) had been receiving regular salaries in spite of remaining absent from their place of duty for the period of one month. Dr Amir Hameed took no action against the two parties when they were defaming the institution, the committee found.  
It recommended that Dr Maaz Qasim, Dr Muhammad Ali Khan, Dr Usman Nasir, Dr Sidra Rehman, Dr Tabinda Khan and Dr Aemen Samad should be issued a warning.  
It said Dr Sundus Naeem, EMO/DMS, should be terminated from service as she did not bother to appear before the inquiry committee in spite of repeated warnings.  
After these recommendations, SZMCH MS Dr Agha Touhid, through letter No.26120-25/SZH dated July 27, 2022 reported to SHC&ME department secretary that in the light of inquiry said doctors have been found guilty of misconduct, hence strict action might be initiated against them as per rules.
Dr Farhana Khalid told this correspondent that Dr Shazia Majid declared her guilty in the inquiry report despite the fact that she was harassed by a group of doctors.
She said that she would approach the higher forum to get justice.
SZMCH spokesperson DMS Rana Ilyas Ahmed told Dawn that the final decision on the issue of harassment and other incidences of misconduct would be taken by the the department’s secretary being the competent authority.
