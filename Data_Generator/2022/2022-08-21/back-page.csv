0,Spotlight on economic ties during Bilawal’s Euro-trip,"FM Bilawal will visit Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway from Aug 22 to 26.","ISLAMABAD: In a move to strengthen bilateral cooperation and economic ties, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari will visit four European countries in his maiden trip to the continent from Aug 22 to 26.
During the five-day trip, the foreign minister will visit Germany, Denmark, Sweden and Norway.
According to Foreign Office Spokesperson Asim Iftikhar, besides the political aspect of relations with these countries, trade and economic ties will be a ‘strong focus’ of the foreign minister’s agenda for the trip.
The four countries were significant for Pakistan’s ties with Europe because of the strong presence of Pakistani diaspora in these countries and their investments in Pakistan, he added.
In his interactions with his counterparts and other high ranking officials during the trip, the foreign minister would emphasise on further deepening bilateral economic engagement, in addition to exploring opportunities for Pakistanis in those countries.
With regards to Germany, several high-level engagements have taken place between the two countries, both at political and military level, suggesting the importance the two countries were attaching to their ties. Moreover, German firms have also demonstrated interest in investing in Pakistan. 
“Pakistan has long-standing and multi-dimensional relations with Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,” the spokesperson said, adding that these countries are home to a sizable Pakistani community and preferred destinations for Pakistani students to pursue higher education.
These countries also have significant investment ties with Pakistan, Mr Iftikhar added.
“The foreign minister’s visits will impart further impetus to Pakistan’s multi-faceted engagement with these countries.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s trip was being seen as an opportunity to consolidate and expand bilateral cooperation with European partners and strengthen engagement with the continent in general, said the spokesperson.
The foreign minister was also scheduled to sign a “Green Framework Engagement” agreement with Denmark, focusing on climate change cooperation.
The foreign minister would also share Pakistan’s perspective on regional and global issues, the FO spokesperson said about the visit.

1,Imran claims statement about Rushdie attack ‘taken out of context’,KARACHI: Former prime minister Imran Khan said on Saturday that British newspaper The Guardian had taken his ...,"KARACHI: Former prime minister Imran Khan said on Saturday that British newspaper The Guardian had taken his comments on the attack on Salman Rushdie “out of context”.
In an interview with the UK-based publication on Friday, Mr Khan was quoted as terming the knife attack on the Indian-born novelist “sad” and “terrible”, which could not be justified in the name of Islam, according to a Dawn.com report.
However, in a statement issued on PTI’s official Twitter account on Saturday, the ex-PM said his statement was taken out of context. In the tweet, Mr Khan explained that he had refused to attend a seminar in India where Salman Rushdie had been invited. “In the interview [to Guardian], I explained the Islamic method of punishing blasphemers.
“I gave the example of the Sialkot incident […] spoke about Rushdie in the same context,” he clarified, referring to the ghastly murder of a Sri Lankan national last year over blasphemy charges.
However, Julian Borger, one of the two reporters who interviewed Mr Khan, said in a tweet on Saturday that they did not misquote Imran Khan. 
Also on Saturday, during a meeting with YouTubers at Banigala, the PTI chairman reiterated that his “views on Rushdie are clear”, adding that he would never approach a forum associated with the author.
Salman Rushdie, whose sacrilegious writings made him the target of death threats, was stabbed in the neck and torso onstage at a lecture in New York state on Aug 12.
Although Mr Khan’s statement to the UK-based paper was well-received in some circles, an effort was made on social media to paint him as someone who sympathised with blasphemers. A hashtag that tried to paint him  in this light trended on Twitter throughout  the day on Saturday, and several users blamed the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan for running a coordinated campaign against the PTI chief.

2,"UN ends travel exemptions for Taliban, at least till Monday",Fresh US proposal suggests limiting number of exempted Taliban leaders from 13 to six; Russia and China seek time to consider...,"UNITED NATIONS: A divided UN Security Council has ended the travel ban exemptions for 13 Taliban officials after failing to reach an agreement on a possible extension.
But the committee will meet again on Monday to reconsider the exemptions that expired at midnight on Friday.
Under a 2011 UN Security Council resolution, 135 Taliban officials are facing sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans. Of these, 13 were granted exemptions in 2019 on the request of the Trump administration.
This was a Taliban precondition for a peace deal with the United States. The deal, known as the Doha agreement, was signed in February 2020 and ultimately led to the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan in August 2021.

Fresh US proposal suggests limiting number of exempted Taliban leaders from 13 to six; Russia and China seek time to consider

During the Security Council’s Friday evening session, Russia and China demanded allowing all 13 Taliban leaders to continue to travel. The US and western nations sought to reduce the number to protest Taliban’s continued denial of basic human rights to Afghan citizens, particularly women.
The United States, which eliminated Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri in Kabul in a drone strike two weeks ago, is also concerned about the reemergence of militancy in Afghanistan under the Taliban.
Russia and China asked for more time to consider the US proposal. Since the council members could not reach an agreement, the ban on all 13 Taliban officials was restored until Monday afternoon, when Russia and China must respond to the US proposal.   
In June, the Security Council’s sanctions monitoring committee banned two Taliban officials — Said Ahmad Shadikhel and Abdul Baqi Basir Awal Shah — from travelling in response to their crackdown on women. Shadikhel is the acting deputy education minister while Shah is the acting minister of higher education.  
The US proposal, submitted on Thursday, suggested imposing the travel ban on seven of the 13 Taliban leaders and keeping the exemption for six others, limiting their travel only to Qatar, where US-Taliban talks have taken place.  
Russia and China made a counter-proposal that all 13 Taliban officials be granted travel exemptions for 90 days, but only to go to Russia, China, Qatar and other “regional countries,” such as Pakistan.  
Russia and China objected to the US proposal while Britain, France and Ireland opposed the Russia-China proposal, insisting that the exemption can’t continue for all 13 officials.
On Friday afternoon, the US revised its proposal, agreeing to a confined travel ban to seven of the Taliban officials and to keep the travel waivers for six others for 90 days, with no geographic limits.  
Russia and China agreed to consider the revised proposal and submit their response on Monday.
In 2019, at the behest of Trump administration, the Security Council first waived the long-standing travel ban imposed on 41 Taliban officials. This allowed 15 leaders to travel for “peace and stability discussions”.
In return, the Taliban guaranteed not to attack US and Nato personnel during the withdrawal.  
In September 2021, shortly after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan, the Biden administration requested the first extension to the waiver, allowing the 13 Taliban officials to continue to travel.
In June this year, major human rights groups urged the UN to end the Trump-era waiver as it allowed those Taliban leaders who were responsible for the oppression of women in Afghanistan to travel abroad.
