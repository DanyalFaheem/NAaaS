0,Rupee’s appreciation brings no relief to consumers,Commodity prices even go up or stay unchanged despite nearly 12pc increase in local currency’s value against dollar.,"KARACHI: The coalition government has failed to provide any relief to the masses awaiting a price cut in all essential commodities after the strengthening of the rupee against the US dollar.
All commodity prices have soared or stayed unchanged despite an almost 12 per cent jump in the rupee’s value, which has substantially brought down the landed cost of imported goods mainly palm oil, pulses and other foodstuffs.
Commodity market players increase prices after the dollar rises, but they usually don’t reduce rates when the rupee appreciates, reflecting weak monitoring by federal and provincial governments.
On July 28, the greenback was available at Rs239.96 in the interbank market compared to the current rate of Rs214. A survey showed that in less than a month the price of masoor soared to Rs340-380 per kg from Rs320-340, mung to Rs210-240 from Rs190-220, mash to Rs360-400 from Rs320-360 and gram pulse to Rs240-260 from Rs230-250. 

Commodity prices even go up or stay unchanged despite nearly 12pc increase in local currency’s value against dollar

Pulses’ import rose to 59,352 tonnes ($53m) in July from 48,392 tonnes in June ($43m). However, these figures are much lower than imports of 127,167 tonnes ($89m) in July 2021.
In FY22, pulses imports fell to 897,352 tonnes ($611m) from 1.266m tonnes ($709m) in FY21.
Karachi Wholesalers Grocers Association Patron-in-Chief Anis Majeed said heavy rains in the interior Sindh had seriously affected the drying process of pulses (whole form) at processing mills, resulting in slowing down of supplies in the wholesale market. Drying of pulses takes at least one day.
He said importers had also released previous shipments at higher dollar values, thus making them a bit hesitant in cutting the prices.
Consumers have also not witnessed any downward trend in the prices of tea and ghee/cooking oil which had been raised on the sliding rupee against the greenback. Tier 1 branded five-litre cooking oil pack still costs Rs2,995. The 2.5 kg ghee sells at Rs1,480 while one kg/litre pouch of ghee and cooking oil is priced at Rs580. 
Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers Association General Secretary Umer Islam Khan said the manufacturers of second and third-tier brands, which usually don’t carry a price tag, had reduced prices to Rs450 from Rs510-520 per kg/litre on ghee and cooking oil. Some low-quality products were selling below Rs400 per kg/litre.
However, tier one manufacturers usually print their prices on every pack and they maintain a gap of one month in announcing new prices depending on the palm oil prices and rupee-dollar rates.
Mr Islam claimed that tier one brand makers are likely to slash prices in the last week of August as their stocks of higher prices have almost exhausted in the markets.
He said world palm oil prices had plunged to $1,050-1,100 after hitting a peak of $2,050 per tonne in March. The July shipments booked at $1,030 per tonne are now arriving at the port.
The manufacturers are passing on the impact of falling palm oil prices and rupee recovery against the dollar despite higher transportation charges, gas and power rates, he said, recalling that many shipments were booked at higher rates a few months back and were released when one dollar was equal to almost Rs240 during the last week of July.
Palm oil imports in July surged to 188,562 tonnes ($299m) from 86,975 tonnes ($143m) in June and 221,677 tonnes ($254m) in July 2021.
Palm oil imports, however, plunged to 2.8mn tonnes ($3.549bn) from 3.197mn tonnes ($2.668bn) in FY21.
Costly tea 
A trader said the tea prices have not fallen yet and instead unpacked brands had seen a rise ofRs150-200 per kg in the last four months due to the clearing of old shipments from the port at a higher dollar value.
Wheat and sugar are also being imported to bridge the demand-supply gap but they could not ensure any price cut so far. The price of a 20kg wheat flour bag has risen to Rs1,880-1,960 from Rs1,800-1,940 per bag in less than a month. Pakistan imported 2.2m tonnes of wheat valuing $795m in FY22 versus 3.6m tonnes costing $983m in FY21. In July, wheat imports stood at 211,597 tonnes ($107m).

1,Alvi orders HBL to compensate defrauded depositors,The six cases involved a total amount of Rs1 million.,"KARACHI:  Putting the weight of his office behind ordinary depositors who fell  victim to scammers, Presi­dent Arif Avi on Saturday ordered Habib Bank  Ltd (HBL) to “refund and compensate” the six defrauded customers.
The  president rejected the six “representations” filed by HBL against the  earlier decisions of the banking ombudsman, an autonomous federal  institution that helps resolve disputes between commercial banks and  their complainants.
A “representation” is the appeal that a person  or entity aggrieved by any decision of the banking ombudsman files with  the president wit­h­in 30 days of the decision.
The six cases involved a total amount of Rs1 million.
Fraudsters called up the account holders and provided them with information regarding their names, national identity card numbers, dates of birth  and ATM card numbers. Then the scammers obtained from the unsuspecting depositors the names of their mothers — a vital piece of information  that’s used in carrying out online transactions. The scammers then used  this information to deprive the account holders of their deposits by  making multiple e-commerce transactions. The fraudsters were able to  pull the trick even though the bank customers were not using any mobile  app and were also in possession of their ATM cards.
When the victims appro­ached their respective banks to freeze their  accounts and seek refunds, they were not provided with any  relief.
Feeling  aggrieved, the account holders approached the banking ombudsman, which  decided in favour of the applicants after hearing arguments “on account  of banking malpractices, maladministration, wrongdoings, fraudulent  transactions and the corrupt and mala fide practices by bank officials”.
HBL chose to further esc­a­late the matter, however, and filed separate representations with the president.
While  rejecting the representations, President Alvi observed that the victims  were deprived of their hard-earned deposits when the bank  “unilaterally” activated the electronic funds transfer (EFT) facility  without any request from, or consent of, the account holders.

2,Visas to truck drivers will boost trade with Kabul,Islamabad mulls similar arrangement with Uzbekistan.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan  and Afghanistan have reached an agreement to give six-month visas to  truck drivers on a reciprocal basis to facilitate the cross-border  movement of goods between the two countries.
The issuance of visas  will facilitate the flow of trade, said Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar  at the sidelines of an event in Islamabad on Saturday. The issuance  of visas is one of the measures to facilitate trans-border trade.
On  July 5, the government took a major decision to allow trade of all  products to Kabul in the rupee via land routes owing to the  non-availability of tradable currency through banking channels. More  measures were taken to facilitate trade with Kabul since August 2021.

Islamabad mulls similar arrangement with Uzbekistan

The minister said that Pakistan was going to sign an agreement with Uzbekistan for the issuance of a  six-month visa to truck drivers on a reciprocal basis. “Pakistani trucks will be able to come not only to Afghanistan but also to Uzbekistan,” Mr Qamar added.
Answering a question, the minister said that there was also a demand to allow  Afghan trucks to cross the Wagah border. He said due to political tensions with India it is not possible. “We will consider this when things return  to normal with India”, the minister remarked.
The minister  further said that trade with Saarc countries will also be taken into  consideration after improving the situation with India. Pakistan has already  turned into a net importer from Afghanistan since the Taliban took  control of Kabul in August 2021.
During the period, Pakistan’s  exports to Afghanistan also saw a deeper drop due to the  non-availability of tradable currency through banking channels.  Afghanistan was the third largest export destination for Pakistani  products, but the trend changed in the past couple of years.
Pakistan’s  exports to Afghanistan fell by30 per cent to $717.53 million in 2021-22  from $1.018bn in 2020-21. Since Aug 15, 2021, when the Taliban took over  and declared their rule over Afghanistan, Islamabad has offered Kabul —  among other humanitarian assistance — waivers of duty and taxes on  fresh and dried fruits, vegetables and several other products.
As a  result of this decision, the import of commodities from Afghanistan  posted an unprecedented increase. Pakistan’s trade surplus with  Afghanistan turned into a deficit. 
The imports from  Afghanistan reached $801.28m in FY22 compared to $583.59m in the  preceding year, showing an increase of 37pc.
In the year 2019-20,  imports from Afghanistan were just $470.9m. The data showed that the  massive imports from Afghanistan led to dollar outflows and cause undue  pressure on the rupee. Moreover, the smuggling of dollars is believed  to be another factor for continuing trade in the greenbacks.

3,Foreign currency shortage hits open market,"Recently, Dubai authorities have asked Pakistanis to have 5,000 dirhams when landing at Dubai airport.","KARACHI: After a long time, the open market is running short of US dollars, which increased the price compared to the interbank rate of the greenback.
The Forex Association of Pakistan reported the dollar traded at a price of Rs218 in the open market on Saturday, while the inter-bank dollar rate was Rs214.65 on Friday. Banking markets are closed on Saturday.
Currency dealers said that the latest development has created a shortage of foreign currency, particularly the UAE dirham, and ultimately exportable currencies declined.
“Each Pakistani needs to declare 5,000 dirhams at the UAE airport at the time of landing this week, which suddenly created a shortage,” said Malik Bostan, president of the forex association, adding that 21 flights from Pakistan land in Dubai each day, carrying a total of 4,200 Pakistanis per day.
Recently, Dubai authorities have asked Pakistanis to have 5,000 dirhams when landing at Dubai airport. The calculations show that 4,200 Pakistanis require about 21 million dirhams each day to land in Dubai.
“The dirham is not available in the open market while the price has also gone up,” he said, adding that those available foreign currencies are exported to Dubai to bring back an equal amount of US dollars. Higher dirham demand, in fact, created a shortage of dollars.
At the same time, the government’s new move asks people to declare their cash and other valuables at the time of departure and arrival.
Currency dealers said the declaration of cash and valuables at the time of arrival in their own country does not make sense; in fact, it has created a fear that declared cash and valuables could put them in trouble.
“Many people from the Middle East arrive with cash in riyals and dirhams. They also bring cash from their colleagues to directly handover the cash to their families in Pakistan. Now no Pakistani can take this risk,” said Mr Bostan.
The arrival of foreign currencies in the open market has dropped to the range of $1-2 million per day, while it was around $4m per day.
Currency dealers said the open market could see more shortages in the coming days since exportable foreign currencies have declined.

4,Ports to release stuck goods with penalty,ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Saturday said the goods stuck at the ports would be gradually released...,"ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Saturday said the goods stuck at the ports would be gradually released with penalty surcharge.
“To meet with our international obligations, the government has issued an SRO to reverse the ban on imports of luxury items. The goods stuck at the ports will gradually be released with penalty surcharge of up to 100pc of assessed value”, he said in a tweet.
He said the Tariff Policy Board would soon come up with new Regulatory Duty rates that would ensure that the country’s limited foreign exchange is spent on essential items and not on these items that have been unbanned.  “We must live within our means”, he added.

5,"Govt working to reshape economy, says Ahsan","""All developed countries have made export-led growth their first priority,"" he says.","LAHORE: The government is working hard to reshape the economy from import substitution to export-oriented and the private sector should take a driving seat and help us in accomplishing this work, Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal said on Saturday. 
Speaking at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI), the planning minister requested the private sector to take the driving seat to move Pakistan forward. He said the only way to develop is to enable people by removing all the bottlenecks in this regard. 
The minister was of the view that the private sector should be given the opportunity to make “Made in Pakistan” a standard brand worldwide and to increase national exports. While discussing and comparing the volume of exports of Pakistan with other countries, he said the country’s exports in the 1960s were $ 200 million—equaling the combined exports of South Korea, Malaysia, and Thailand.
“Today, the exports of South Korea are over $ 600 billion, Malaysia’s over $300bn, and Thailand’s over $267bn, while we have reached only $30bn during this period,” he said.
The minister further revealed that the exports of Turkey have increased from $50bn in the year 2000 to $288bn today. “All developed countries have made export-led growth their first priority,” he added.
Mr Iqbal agreed with the LCCI that political stability is a must for economic development. The country, he said, has got a rare opportunity in the shape of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. And at the time, when no-one was ready to invest a single dollar in Pakistan, the Chinese president signed the agreements worth $46bn. 
“The development budget in 2018 was Rs1,000bn, but when we came back to power in April 2022, it was reduced to Rs550bn,” he said, adding that local and foreign investors should be encouraged to invest.
He said the country’s tax-to-GDP ratio is only 9.5 per cent, whereas we need at least 18-20pc to ensure sustainable development. “We also need to develop entrepreneurship in the country. Moreover, we need to improve Pakistan’s ranking in the world EODB Index,” he emphasised.
Mr Iqbal said Pakistan now has 350 universities and more than 3,000km of motorways. But unfortunately, our speed of growth is very slow compared to other countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and Bangladesh.

Furthermore, LSM data showed there was a jump of 11.7 per cent in big-industry production on a year-on-year basis in 2021-22.
However, profit-taking kic­ked in mid-week while the announcement of the impo­sition of potentially Rs50bn new taxes also weak­e­ned the market sentiment.
Moreover, the rupee once again witnessed some depr­eciation against the dollar in the outgoing week.
Yet the benchmark of the stock market closed in the green zone at 43,270 points, up 413 points or 0.96pc on a week-on-week basis.
The monetary policy is due on Monday and, according to analysts at AKD Securities, the policy rate may increase 50-100 basis points. “The monetary policy decision is likely to drive the market’s momentum in the coming week…”

7,EU fiscal oversight of Greece ends after 12 years,Ending the oversight will strengthen Greece’s international market position by increasing its attractiveness to investors.,"ATHENS: Greece on Saturday concluded 12 years of European Union fiscal surveillance that was imposed in return for bailouts after a crushing debt crisis.
In November 2009, Athens revealed a sharp rise in its public deficit that eventually led to a financial crisis across the eurozone and wreaked havoc on Greek finances for a decade.
In exchange for bailout cash of 289 billion euros and to stop Greece from crashing out of the eurozone, a  “troika”, made up of the International Monetary Fund, EU and the European Central Bank, demanded across-the-board reforms from Athens.
These included deep state spending and salary cuts, tax hikes, privatisations and other sweeping reforms aimed at righting public finances.
The economy contracted by more than a quarter, unemployment spiked to almost 28 percent and skilled professionals emigrated in droves.
“A cycle of 12 years which brought pain to citizens, led to economic stagnation and divided society,” has ended, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.
“A new horizon filled with growth, unity and prosperity emerges for all,” he said.  “The Greece of today is a different Greece.
“We have recorded strong growth and a significant slide in unemployment of three percent since last year and 5 percent since 2019,” he added.
Ending the oversight will strengthen Greece’s international market position by increasing its attractiveness to investors. Athens will also now have greater control over its domestic economic policy.
“The end of enhanced surveillance for Greece also marks the symbolic conclusion of the most challenging period the euro area has experienced,” Paolo Gentiloni, the European Commissioner for Economy, said in a statement.
“The sovereign debt crisis that defined the first years of the previous decade was a steep learning curve for our Union.
“Our strong collective response to the pandemic indicated that Europe had learned the lessons of that crisis. We must show the same solidarity and unity as we navigate the troubled waters our economies are now entering.” Greece — like fellow bailed-out EU members Spain, Portugal, Cyprus and Ireland — will still be monitored by its creditors while paying back its debts.
In Greece’s case, that will take another two generations, with the last loans due for repayment in 2070.
According to European Commission projections, the Greek economy will grow by 4 percent this year, much higher than the eurozone average of 2.6pc.
