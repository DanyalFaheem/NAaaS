Ms Khar, while speaking at an event on the upcoming 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China hosted by Pakistan-China Institute, said Pakistan was “unapologetically close” to China in a strategic partnership which was growing.
She said that there was a broad consensus across the political divide that China was the cornerstone of the country’s foreign policy. This emphasis on ties with China, she said, was given by former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and no subsequent government altered this fundamental principle of the foreign policy.
China, Ms Khar said, united Pakistan and was a pillar of peace and stability in the region and a preserver, promoter and protector of principles of peaceful coexistence in the region.
“The initiatives launched by President Xi Jinping, whether it is Global Development Initiative or Global Security Initiative, were a testament to the fact that China prioritised human security and stability over confrontation,” she observed.
Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Nong Rong expressed solidarity with Pakistan over the floods that have wreaked havoc across the country and said China would not leave Pakistan in such testing times.
Commenting on the National Peoples’ Congress, he said it was the most important political agenda towards the end of the year.
The Congress is held every five years, where China watchers look for clues to the country’s future. President Xi Jinping is expected to be re-elected for his third term as Secretary General of CPC and President of China. Moreover, the Congress will set key priorities for the next five years, in particular, as well as China’s two-stage development plan for the middle of the 21st century.
Meanwhile, CPEC, he said, had transformed Pakistan’s socio-economic landscape by overhauling infrastructure and alleviating the energy crisis. He termed Pakistan-China relations as ‘rock-solid’.
In his opening remarks, Chairman of Senate Committee on Defence and Pakistan-China Institute Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed said the core message emanating from President Xi Jinping’s leadership was people-centric development and human security.
He said that the Global Development Initiative (GDI), introduced by President Xi Jinping on Sept 21, 2021, promoted inclusive and open collaboration and was a crucial platform for international cooperation and the public good that China offered.
Similarly, he recalled, President Xi, this year, announced the Global Security Initiative (GSI) for ‘upholding the principle of indivisible security, building a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and opposing the building of national security based on insecurity in other countries’.

1,Delay in approval of curriculum for minority students raises eyebrows,Sources say summary had been sent to education ministry in May.,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Education notified the national curriculum for classes fifth to eighth a few months ago and subsequently students started the new academic session with new books. 
However, no curriculum has been notified for students from the minority communities.
In the absence of a notified curriculum, students belonging to seven religious communities – Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Kalash, Bahai, Buddhist and Parsi – have been pursuing education without their religious books.
Sources said a few months ago, the National Curriculum Council (NCC) had sent a summary to the Ministry of Education for notifying the new curriculum for minority students from classes one to eighth, but the summary is yet to be approved, putting a huge question mark on the efficiency of the country’s education managers.

Sources say summary had been sent to education ministry in May

Joint Secretary (JS) Education Waseem Ajmal confirmed to Dawn that the new curriculum for religious minorities had not been notified. He said that content of the curriculum was being examined as some experts say the subject of ethics should be continued in schools for minorities while others  say more religious education should be imparted to minority students.
Mr Ajmal said that there was no deliberate delay or discrimination against minority students.
He said the issue would be resolved within a week and it will be settled in accordance with the wishes and aspirations of religious minorities and rules and regulations of the country.
Meanwhile, Secretary Education Aamir Ashraf Khawaja could not be reached for his comments.
Sources said NCC after getting comprehensive input from religious minorities had moved the summary to the ministry, but now, some officials are using delaying tactics in deciding the fate of this important summary.
People from various sects of all seven religious minorities, with consensus, agreed on the draft curriculum, prepared by NCC, which was sent to Ministry of Education in May but it has still not been approved.
Sources said that the draft curriculum was prepared for seven religious minorities and if the same was notified, the government will have to publish 35 books (one book each for seven religious minorities) for class one to five and 21 books for class six to eight based on enrolled numbers of students.
The sources said technically the curriculum for minorities from class one to five should have been notified last year when the ministry notified the new curriculum for Muslim students.
They said this year the ministry notified the new curriculum for  class fifth to eight and based on that from this academic session, which started on Aug 1, new books were introduced in schools.
“Neither last year nor this year [so far] the curriculum for religious minorities has been notified,” said an official of the ministry, adding Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Education Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain should take notice of the issue.
“The delay warrants an official inquiry,” the official said and added that Ministry of Education a couple of years ago had promised a commission formed by the Supreme Court that a new curriculum would be prepared for minority students.
“The curriculum has been prepared, but a notification is not being issued so this is a matter of concern,” he said.
Though the ministry failed to make any headway in notifying curriculum for minorities during the last three months, it renamed the Single National Curriculum (SNC) a much-hyped initiative of the previous PTI government as the National Curriculum of Pakistan (NCP).
“The National Curriculum of Pakistan (NCP) is the new name of the curriculum reforms,” said Education Minster Rana Tanveer Hussain last month.
Addressing a workshop in Islamabad, the minister had said: “The word ‘single’ caused confusion and excluded the diversity education that is an asset to our country’s rich heritage. We are now ready for getting back on track.” The education minister had added that NCP will be a comprehensive exercise, covering all four aspects of a quality curriculum.

4,Wasa facing fund shortage to supply water from Chahan Dam to Rawalpindi,"Amount released by Punjab insufficient to commence work, official says","RAWALPINDI: The Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) is facing budgetary constraints to acquire land for setting up a water filtration plant and related structures that will ensure water supply from Chahan Dam to the garrison city.
On the other hand, the agency has started work on establishing the Project Management Unit (PMU) for laying a water supply line that will bring six million gallons of water daily (MGD) from Chahan Dam to the garrison city.
The PMU is necessary to execute and monitor the project.
The agency has sought applications to appoint the project director and other officials, however, it will not start land acquisition at the moment due to slow pace of funding by the Punjab government for the project. Meanwhile, experts were of the view that the project will not start in the current year.

Amount released by Punjab insufficient to commence work, official says

Chahan Dam is almost complete but work has still not been initiated to bring 6 MGD of water. 
The provincial government released Rs800 million for the establishment of the PMU but failed to release funds for land acquisition. It had approved the project worth Rs5.3 billion in December 2018.
Chahan Dam, which is situated near Chakri, is being constructed by the Punjab government on Sill Kus River and is 22km away from the garrison city.
A senior Wasa official told Dawn that the provincial government had released Rs250 million in the fiscal year 2020 and Rs200 million in 2021 but it was insufficient for commencing work.
He said 150 kanals would be acquired for which Rs650 million was needed, adding that land acquisition would likely start in the next fiscal year.
He said according to the plan, intake chamber would be built at Chahan, filtration plant in Chakri and a pumping station in Ranyal. He said 80 kanals would be required for the filtration plant and 35 kanals each in Ranyal and Chakri.
He said the union councils which would benefit from the water supply from Chahan Dam are Dhamial, Chakra, Girja, Chak Jalaldin 1 and 2, Dhama Syedan, Kilial and Lakhan.
The official said the cost of the project was expected to increase from Rs6 billion to Rs8 billion as the construction cost had risen and the rates of all government projects had increased by 25pc.
He said the revised PC-I would be submitted to the planning and development department for final approval, adding that the agency had completed its homework in this regard.
According to official figures, the current water demand of the city having a population of about 1.5 million was 50 MGD. The city relies mainly on Rawal and Khanpur dams in addition to groundwater drawn from 440 tubewells. 
The total extraction from these sources is 37 MGD (21 from tubewells and 16 MGD from the dams).
When contacted, Wasa spokesman Umer Farooq said the agency had prepared the project to bring water from Chahan Dam to overcome shortage in the union councils of the defunct Potohar Town.
He said after the establishment of the PMU, work would start and be completed at the earliest.

The official said the water level in the dam was recorded at 1,939 feet on August 29 last year - about 39 feet low than the preset level - because of the heavy rains in the catchment areas of the dam, especially Murree, Ayubia and other hilly areas in upper Hazara.
Meanwhile, the beauty of the lake has attracted people from different areas. 
The dam not only provides drinking water to Islamabad and Rawalpindi but is also a source for irrigation in some parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
The official said there would be no a shortage of water in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. 
The dam’s high water level will also help in maintaining groundwater level from Khanpur to Attock, he added.

8,Pakistan to host Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards this year,Local business owners to get chance to meet entrepreneurs from 16 countries.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is set to host the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance Awards (APICTA) for the first time ever. This will provide representatives from local companies to meet innovators and entrepreneurs from the region. The event is planned for the first week of December where all 16 member countries are expected to participate.
This was announced by a delegation headed by Stan Singh, that is currently visiting Pakistan.
Mr Singh said the reason for choosing Pakistan was that the country went through a challenging period and the economy was now back on track, and information and communication technology (ICT) sector of the country was growing at a fast pace, with high quality human resource.
He was accompanied by Badar Khushnood as well as Fulvio Inserra.

Local business owners to get chance to meet entrepreneurs from 16 countries

They pointed out that APICTA was an international awards programme which aimed to increase awareness about communication and technology and assist communities in bridging the digital divide.
Mr Singh said the ICT was no more a business enabler but business itself and there was a need to develop a competitive environment among the APICTA members to enhance the quality of IT services.
Current members are Australia, Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Macao, Malaysia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam and Nepal, whereas South Korea, New Zealand andthe Philippines have applied for membership.
Participants of the programme comprise members of the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance and the key benefit of the awards is gathering help in identifying how member countries can work together for growth of the ICT industry in the region.
Mr Khushnood said P@SHA, the apex trade body for the IT and IT-enabled Services (ITeS) industry, was conducting the 18th annual P@SHA ICT awards later in October this year and through a detailed process of evaluation by a jury of world-renowned members.
The winners and runner-ups will consequently be participating in the Asia-Pacific ICT Alliance (APICTA) Awards 2022 to showcase their talent and compete on an international platform.
He said the IT industry was currently the only industry in Pakistan that could grow at an exponential rate and contribute towards export growth in the same spirit by the highest cash flow positive grading and the easiest to expand since the industry relied only on availability of talent and conducive policies to help it grow. He said the ICT sector was the second biggest exporting sector of Pakistan after textile as it had already surpassed rice exports.
The IT industry exports in the last two years have jumped from approximately $1.4 billion in 2020 to $2.62 billion in 2022, and P@SHA had asked the government to maintain consistent policies in IT and telecom for long-term growth in this sector.

They blocked the main double road of F-10 with burning tyres and raised slogans against MCI and the concerned assistant commissioner for conducting anti-encroachment operations and sealing some hotels on Sunday.  They kept the main road blocked for more than an hour.
They warned the MCI/DMA not to conduct operations without taking the concerned traders’ union on board, adding that instead of targeting legitimate shopkeepers, action should be taken against vendors.
Traders leaders including Tahir Abbasi, Malik Ahmed, Malik Naeem, Sardar Tahir and Chaudhry Khalid spoke on the occasion and condemned the operations.
“We have been paying main role in country’s economy and currently in almost all markets of Islamabad we have set up relief camps for flood affectees. At this critical stage, DMA is targeting shopkeepers, who pay huge rent to landlords and doing legitimate business. 
“We are not against the operations and want markets should be cleared but DMA is not taking action against vendors and stallholders,” said Federation of Realtors Pakistan and the Islamabad Estate Agents Association President Sardar Tahir Mehmood.
Speaking at the protest venue, he said that the administration should sit with traders for resolving the issue of encroachment in Islamabad. DMA Director Shakeel Arshad said the operation was conducted to remove encroachments from F-10 Markaz. 
He said that confiscated items had been handed over to Shalimar police.
In the past, the DMA used to confiscate items from encroachers, however, a few days ago the MCI decided that instead of bringing the confiscated items to DMA store, the same should be handed over to the area police.  It seems this step has perturbed traders.

13,Internal dissent surfaces in Azad Kashmir govt,MUZAFFARABAD: A covert campaign by a key leader of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in Azad Jammu and...,"MUZAFFARABAD: A covert campaign by a key leader of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) to replace Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas by himself seems to have fallen flat for the time being for want of the requisite support from within the parliamentary party, it emerged on Monday.
Ilyas was elected as new Leader of the House in April this year, replacing Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi, the first pick of Imran Khan, after the PTI clinched a clear victory in July 2021 polls in Azad Kashmir.
However, for quite some time the AJK capital has again been abuzz with speculations that another no-confidence motion is on the cards. The speculations had borrowed credence after Speaker Chaudhry Anwarul Haq’s strained relations with Mr Ilyas and his alleged secret meetings with some opposition leaders for their support to his candidature for the coveted office or vice versa.
Initially a strong proponent of Ilyas’ nomination for the AJK premiership, Mr Haq has been at loggerheads with him for the past few months in protest against what he believes the latter’s “extraordinary leanings” towards President Barrister Sultan Mahmood.
He was particularly angry at preference to Mahmood in matters related to Mirpur division, mainly the postings and transfers of senior officials, sources in the PTI said. Both Mr Haq and Mr Mahmood come from Mirpur division’s Bhimber and Mirpur districts, respectively.
At least two important cabinet members, who spoke to Dawn on condition of anonymity, said Mr Haq “wanted his choice in transfers and postings of civil servants in Mirpur division implemented without an iota of dissent”.
The other minister recalled that during the recent Assembly sessions, Mr Haq did not camouflage his resentment towards the government following which PM Ilyas had constituted a ministerial committee to address his “genuine concerns and grievances”.
Sources close to the prime minister confided to Dawn that on Friday night Mr Ilyas had discussed in detail the prevailing situation with Aamer Mehmood Kiani, PTI’s additional secretary general, in the context of the origin of rumours about a no trust against him, and both had “resolved to cut the conspirators down to size”.
“Following a briefing by Mr Kiani, the PTI chairman has not only expressed his trust in PM Ilyas but has also assured him that any conspiracy to destabilise his government will not be tolerated,” the sources claimed.
However, what had further incensed Mr Haq was PM Ilyas’ meeting with Raja Zulqarnain Khan – a prominent political figure and former AJK president belonging to Bhimber - at his private residence in Islamabad on Sunday.
Later in the afternoon, President Mahmood had also driven to the PM’s residence and both leaders were seen tittering in a relaxed mood in the officially released photos.
According to sources, Mr Haq had remarked before some people that the PM had crossed the red line by meddling in his constituency.
When contacted by this scribe on phone after several attempts for his version, Mr Haq declined to take up any question on this issue.
This correspondent also made calls to PTI senior vice president Fawad Chaudhry, secretary general Asad Umar and additional secretary general Kiani to ascertain their viewpoint in this regard, but their mobile phones were switched off.
