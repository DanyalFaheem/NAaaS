1,"Big population asked to leave Mehar, K.N. Shah, Johi to escape imminent heavy flooding","High alert sounded as deluge just three kilometres away from Dadu city, warn officials","DADU: The district administration has issued alert over impending threat of flood and asked rural and urban population of Mehar, Khairpur Nathan Shah and Johi towns to immediately move to safe places. 
Districrt officials warned people of Dadu on Monday evening that floodwater had reached just three kilometres away from the city.
Dadu deputy commissioner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah asked assistant commissioners and mukhtiarkars of the towns in a letter to help people shift to safe places. 
He said the floodwaters from breaches in Suprio Bund and MNV Drain had reached Khuda Wah and were developing pressure at the canal’s embankment, just half a kilometre from K.N. Shah town. Fortunately, 80 per cent population of the town had already left for safe places.  

High alert sounded as deluge just three kilometres away from Dadu city, warn officials

The floodwaters moved to Mehar after breach in Suprio dyke at Khan Jo Goth village as work on the construction of ring embankment to protect the town was going on at a rapid pace.  
As the floodwaters were fast closing in on Mehar town, thousands of families along with their children arrived at bypass to move to safe places. 
The residents of Fareedabad were struggling to strengthen ring dyke around the town after breach in FP Bund, which had cut off land link of the town with other areas. 
Gozo, a small town, was completely flooded after the breaches and all of its population moved to main road, Khanpur and Kakar towns. 
Meanwhile, a 200 to 300 foot wide cut was made in Johi branch at Kari Mori to reduce pressure of water on Suprio bund and the water flow was diverted to Manchhar Lake and Johi town. 
Sources said that differences developed between provincial minister Jam Khan Shoro and MNA Rafiq Jamali over the cut. 
In Johi, which faced threat of deluge after breaches in MNV Drain and cut in Johi branch, the residents were frenetically constructing a ring embankment to protect the town from the impending flood. Women and children also participated in the dyke construction.  
The floodwaters had inundated 300 big and small villages before it reached Thrari Jado Shaheed link road, 35 kms from Johi town.  
Murad orders raising of dykes to save towns from deluge
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has directed irrigation and Wapda authorities to strengthen embankments of Main Nara Valley Drain, Indus Link and Johi branch to protect the town of Sehwan, Mehar, Johi and Dadu from much feared deluge in case of dyke breaches. 
He issued the directives during his visit to Manchhar Lake, Dadu, and Johi towns on Monday.  
At the Manchhar, the chief minister was briefed by Superintendent Engineer Shafaqat Wadho who said that the hill torrents from Balochistan had developed four to five breaches in Flood Protective Bund and their water had started entering Shahdadkot, Qubo Saeed Khan and their adjoining areas.  
He said that the main Ghar drain had started flowing backwards and hence it had posed threat to Gaji Khuhawar town. The breaches in Suprio Bund that developed last night at RD-52 and RD-12 were exactly opposite the towns of Mehar and Khairpur Nathan Shah. Since Johi branch was flowing above its capacity, it had to be given a cut to protect the main towns, he informed the chief minister.  
The chief minister said that the water from the breaches would bring floodwaters to K.N. Shah, the western side of Mehar and Johi towns. The irrigation and Wapda authorities had been directed to strengthen protective bund and erect dykes at Mehar bypass, Johi, and K.N. Shah to protect the towns from the floodwaters coming from Balochistan, he said. 
He concluded after discussion with irrigation experts that the floodwaters would ultimately end up in Manchhar Lake, which had already risen to a precarious 120.75 RL. As the Indus River was already in high flood, it too would not accept any more water from the drains, he said.  
Shah directed the irrigation department to keep watch over Indus Link to save Sehwan and its villages.  
He said in answer to journalists’ queries that he had ordered crackdown against hoarders and profiteers and arrest of the agents deducting service charges from Rs25,000 being given to the flood-affected people under BISP. 
At Johi, the chief minister inspected the work on the construction of ring embankment around the town. During his visit, a large number of flood-affected people protested against the administration’s failure to provide them tents and ration bags. They, however, ended the protest on the chief minister’s assurance. 
At Dadu, he told journalists that the embankment of MNV drain would be strengthened to protect the city, which at present faced no threat.  
The chief minister was accompanied by provincial ministers Nasir Shah and Mukesh Chawla. MNAs Rafiq Jamali, Sikandar Rahpoto, MPA Shajila Leghari and others during the visit.

3,Massive breach in irrigation channel’s dyke submerges many villages  in Badin district,DC says entire Tando Bago taluka under threat,"BADIN: Spillage from flooded Left Bank Outfall Drain wreaked havoc in Tando Bago taluka on Monday when the dyke of Puran Dhoro channal in Kolai town developed a massive breach sometime during Sunday night. The gushing water inundated vast farmlands in the taluka and posed a serious threat to hundreds of villages forcing people to move to safe places. 
According to the area people, the dyke was intentionally broken to save lands of certain influential figures of Badin. Initially people saw a 50-foot-wide breach spilling water onto the nearby farmlands and tried to plug it but immense pressure of water widened it to 500 feet during the night, they said.  
Sensing the threat to many villages and towns, Badin Deputy Comm­issioner Agha Shahnawaz sounded a high alert asking residents of over 100 villages to move to safe places. He said the situation at was “alarming” due to mounting pressure. Several hundred people managed to reach relief camps but scores of families defied the evacuation orders and refused to leave their villages, the DC said. 
He warned that Malkani Sharif, Pangrio and other adjacent towns of Tando Bago taluka were under threat of heavy flooding. 

DC says entire Tando Bago taluka under threat

It was gathered till Monday evening that nearly 100 villages had already been vacated and the migrating families had either reached relief camps or taken shelter in their relatives’ houses in Badin and other towns.
According to the LBOD authorities, the area of the breach was not under their jurisdiction since they had handed over its control to the irrigation department. 
No officials concerned proceeded to the breach site to plug it. 
While the army jawans were found engaged in rescue and relief operations in different areas, Navy personnel were reportedly given the task of plugging the breach.
The area people told local reporters that floodwater gushing out of the drain was bound to hit the entire Tando Bago taluka. They appeared sure that it was a “man-made tragedy” and not the natural one. Cuts were intentionally made to the left side of the LBOD to save certain influential people’s lands from flooding, they claimed, adding that the aim could be to reduce water level in the sections of drain in Jhuddo town and Hayat Khaskheli village. They demanded a judicial probe into the matter and action against the culprits.
If the breach was not plunged at the earliest, it would destroy the civic infrastructure and cause heavy damage to thousands of acres in Saman Sarkar, Khairpur Gumboh and Malkani Sharif union councils, they warned.

Minister orders plugging work
Sindh Minister for Irrigation Jam Khan Shoro along with Special Assistant to the CM MPA Arbab Lutufullah and other PPP leaders on Monday visited the site of reported cuts in Puran Dhoro channel and directed the officials concerned to get it plugged, our correspondent at Mithi adds. 
According to the official statement issued from Bilawal House in Karachi, Mr Shoro during his visit said that it was very unfortunate that the breach had further inundated areas of Badin district. He asked the officials fortify the weak sections of Puran Dhoro and LBOD to avoid further displacement of people from Badin and other districts.

The building, built about eight months ago, housed 15 Hindu families. 
The injured were rushed to the Kingri Taluka Hospital for treatment.
According to residents of the neighbourhood, the building had suffered considerable damage during back-to-back downpours last week and its foundations were badly affected by several feet high water that had remained accumulated in the locality for many days.
According to the police, the first and second floors of the building crumbled first, and a little later the entire structure came down with a big bang.
Khairpur SSP Zaffar Iqbal Malik and officials of the police and district administration along with rescue teams rushed to the spot, where Mukhi Gurmukh Das was already present, to supervise the rescue work.

One of the family members, a 20-year-old man, said to be mentally-challenged , was being linked with the incident. 
A police source said that the man had disappeared from the plaza since the incident took place and police had traced him to his maternal grandparents’ home where his family had sent him. “His statement was verified and matched with corroborative evidence collected by police,” said the source.  
He said that ulema, who had raised voice against the incident on Aug 21, would be briefed by police authorities in this regard on Tuesday (today) and they would also be allowed to speak to the suspect. Afterwards, police would disclose his arrest officially, said the source. 
Cantonment police had registered a case against the main suspect, a sanitary worker, under Sections 295-B and 34 PPC on a complaint lodged by one Bilal Abbasi. The suspect is in police custody under court’s orders. 
“The suspect picked up now confessed that it was he who desecrated the holy book in the plaza,” and claimed that he was under a ‘spell’ and he did similar acts earlier as well, said a police source.  
A four-member team headed by SP Headquarter Anil Hyder and SSP interrogated the suspect. “The team and the SSP now want to make the arrest public and allow ulama to speak to the suspect in custody,” said the source. 
Sahibzada Zubair, head of Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan-Noorani, and Gulshan Illahi, a leader of Barelvi school of thought, confirmed they had received a message from the SSP office for a meeting at 2pm on Tuesday. The agenda of the meeting was not conveyed to them, Zubair said.

6,Sindh’s flood-hit areas face outbreak of waterborne diseases among children,"Nearly 0.2m cases of diarrhoea, dysentery reported in August; teams in affected areas say fever, snake-bite cases are common.","• Nearly 0.2m cases of diarrhoea, dysentery reported in August • Teams in affected areas say fever, snake-bite cases are common 
KARACHI: Describing the situation in the flood-hit parts of the province as “extremely critical”, senior health experts representing different non-profit organisations said on Monday that most areas with little access to potable water and food were gripped by waterborne infections, including acute watery diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid and skin ailments. 
The experts recalled that Sindh had been experiencing an increase in diarrheal infections since March this year and devastating rains had made the health challenges far more serious. 
What lends credence to their statements, among other things, is the provincial health department’s data that shows that Sindh has reported 193,048 cases of watery diarrhoea and dysentery in children in August alone, which is so far the highest number this year. A total of 117,999 cases were reported in July. 
“The government relief efforts are nothing but eyewash and most people still have no access to clean drinking water and food. They will die of hunger and disease, if immediate assistance is not provided to them,” Dr Usman Mako heading the Pakistan Medical Association-Sindh chapter said. 
Dr Mako, who was able to evacuate his family out of Sukkur before the flood hit his hometown, said several people, including his family, had lost their houses while others had two to three feet standing water at their places.  
“There is hardly any dry place to take shelter. People have no clue how to drain out water. Diseases like gastroenteritis are rampant, badly affecting the population, especially children,” he said. 
He said the devastation was widespread and few NGOs couldn’t do justice to the job. “Only the government and the army can reach areas cut off by the floodwater.” 
Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, general secretary of the PMA-Karachi, described the situation as “very dangerous” and said government assistance had not reached remote areas.  
“Our teams are working in several districts and they are telling us that scores of people await help in areas away from the flooded road links. These areas are gripped by multiple disease outbreaks including gastroenteritis,” he observed. 
He expressed disappointment over government relief measures and emphasised the need for individual efforts. 
Potable water, food, medicines needed 
Dr Abdullah Muttaqi of the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (Pima) said the conditions in the flood-hit areas “were extremely bad” and might worsen.
“Fever is common and we can’t rule out dengue or malaria. Our teams have also come across several snake-bite cases,” he said, emphasising the need for immediate medical treatment and disease prevention in the flood-hit areas.
Dr Waseem Jamalvi of the Pakistan Paediatric Association, who has recently visited a government relief camp in Dadu, urged the government to take steps to prevent overcrowding at the health campus.
The flood-hit people, he pointed out, were in need of basic things such as clean drinking water, mosquito bed-nets, general medicines, tents, clothes and food items. 
Upon contact, a health department spokesperson blamed flooding and contaminated water for the rise in water-borne infections, particularly diarrhoea. 
“Extreme flooding has made it harder to access people and provide safe drinking water. However, health camps have been established across Sindh. All district health officers and deputy commissioners are coordinating their efforts to bring relief and medical assistance to the people who have been affected by the monsoon flooding,” health department spokesperson Mehar Khurshid said.
Several health camps, she claimed, had been set up in school buildings, whereas mobile health units were reaching out to people stranded in flooded areas. 
“These camps are providing essential medicines for diarrhoea, cholera, gastroenteritis as well as vaccines and nutrition supplements, fogging and fumigation services to prevent mosquito and vector borne diseases,” she said. 
Doctors and paramedics had been mobilised to attend to the displaced persons at these health camps, she added.

7,Haleem Adil Sheikh held in another case after release from prison,"Arrested in land grabbing case, minutes after approval of bail in terrorism case.","KARACHI: Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh was taken into custody by the Anti-Encroachment Force (AEF) minutes after he was released on bail by prison authorities in a terrorism case.
Mr Sheikh, also a leader of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, was shown arrested in a second land grabbing case by AEF authorities.
Mr Sheikh’s dramatic arrest took place as soon as he came out of the Karachi central prison. AEF officials, who were apparently waiting from him outside the prison, whisked him away.
He was later shifted to the Anti-Encroachment police station and shown arrested in another land-grab case.
According to the fresh FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, a former mukhtiarkar had allegedly illegally allotted 25 acres of state land to Mr Sheikh and 10 others for a cooperative housing society in Scheme-33, where the nominated persons had set up a cattle pen and warehouses. They were issued notices under the Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010, asking them to vacate the land in question, but they failed.
A case under Section 8(1) of the Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010 was registered at the Anti-Encroachment police station, East, on the complaint of mukhtiarkar Zulfiqar Ali Mangi on Aug 29.
AEF officials are likely to produce the detained Opposition Leader before the Special Court Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) to seek his physical remand for interrogation.
Earlier in the day, the ATC-XV judge, who was conducting the trial in the judicial complex inside the central prison, pronounced his order on an application seeking grant of post-arrest bail to the PTI leader and his release from prison.
The judge granted him bail subject to furnishing a surety of Rs50,000 and directed the prison authorities to release him immediately if his custody was not required in any other case.
According to the police, Mr Sheikh allegedly facilitated and instigated his aide Shahzada Faheem Laghari to open firing on the AEF’s Director and his team during anti-encroachment operation.
A case was registered under Sections 109 (abetment), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 506-B (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Gulshan-i-Maymar police station.

The SHC observed that the sole eyewitness could not be able to safely and reliably identify the appellants and the identification parade was not conducted as per the law.
It said the widow of the deceased was the most important eyewitness of the case, but she was dropped as a witness by the prosecution without any explanation.
An ATC had sentenced Saad Aziz alias Tin Tin and Tahir Hussain Minhas alias Sain, said to be local IS operatives, to life in prison in December 2020 for killing Captain Nadeem Ahmed of the Pakistan Navy and wounding his foreign wife in an armed attack near Karsaz in September 2013.
The convicts had filed appeals in the SHC against the conviction order of the trial court and after hearing both sides and examining the record and proceedings, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha Khan allowed the appeals and set aside the judgement of trial court.
The bench in its judgement said that the prosecution had not been able to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt as the case was almost rested exclusively on the evidence of lone eyewitness, but his presence at the time of incident was very much doubtful and there appeared to be hardly any cogent evidence to corroborate his testimony.
It further noted that there were contradictions in the evidence of eyewitness and version of prosecution as he had deposed that incident was taken place at a traffic signal and two assailants committed the offence while as per prosecution there were three attackers while a police picture of the bullet-riddled car showed that traffic signal was not near the crime site.
The identification parade was held around two years after the incident, whereas cross-examination of the witness before the trial court also indicated that he saw both appellants before the parade, it added.
The bench further observed that the cross-examination also signified that no dummy was available at the time of the identification parade, therefore, the same was not in accordance with law and besides, it was held 16 days after the arrest of the appellants and such a delay had not been explained by police.
It further said that Dr Tracy, the widow of deceased, also sustained injuries in the incident and was one of the best and most important eyewitnesses, but despite being on the list of prosecution witnesses, she was not called to give her evidence before the trial court and dropped as witness without explanation.
“For the reasons discussed above by extending the benefit of the doubt to the appellants they are acquitted of the charge, the impugned judgement is set aside, their appeals are allowed,” it concluded.
Both the appellants along with their three accomplices were handed down death sentence by a military court in 2016 in the Safoora Goth bus carnage, murder of Sabeen Mahmud and other cases. The ATCs have also convicted them in some other cases as well.

12,"Over 50,000 arrive in Karachi from flooded areas, minister tells meeting","MPA Sajid Jokhio says 3,000-4,000 people coming to city daily; Saeed Ghani fears land grabbers, criminals may exploit situation.","KARACHI: As anticipated, Karachi has started receiving thousands of people displaced by recent floods in different parts of Sindh and a provincial government estimate suggests more than 50,000 people have already arrived and are currently living in camps set up by local administration in the metropolis.
On an average some 3,000 to 4,000 flood-affected people from several calamity-hit districts of the province are reaching the city on a daily basis.
The fresh numbers and estimates were discussed at a meeting of the city chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), where party leaders, legislators and ministers discussed the emerging challenges, the impact of the flood and its repercussions.
Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani, who is also the president of the PPP’s Karachi division, chaired the meeting that discussed the rehabilitation of the flood victims, their current status and a relief strategy.

MPA Jokhio says 3,000-4,000 people coming to city daily; Ghani fears land grabbers, criminals may exploit situation

During the discussion, it emerged that the flood, which left hundreds of thousands of people homeless in different parts of Sindh, had forced a large number of victims to travel to Karachi where they were staying in camps set up by the provincial government. 
At the same time, it was also admitted by the ruling party that certain elements were exploiting the situation and in the garb of flood victims, they could execute their criminal plans.
“So far, some 50,000 [flood-hit] people have already arrived in Karachi,” Minister Ghani told the meeting, according to a party statement. “All these people are staying in the camps set up by the Sindh government in Sachal Goth, and districts East, West and Keamari.”
He said that all the people reached Karachi of their own choice. “There are reports that some land grabbers and criminal elements want to defame the flood victims by using their name for their vested interests.”
Special Assistant to Chief Minister and PPP’s Sindh general secretary Waqar Mehdi told the meeting that the provincial government was arranging medical facilities at all camps where the flood victims were staying. 
He also informed that the party was not collecting any cash donation and if anyone wanted to pay, he/she should deposit it to the Sindh government’s relief account.
Sindh Minister for Women Development Syeda Shehla Raza, who is also the PPP Sindh’s information secretary, stressed for more focus on women and children, the most vulnerable segments among the flood- hit people, and called for special attention on their needs.
“There’s no shortage of food in the [Karachi’s] camps where the flood victims are staying,” she briefed the meeting. “But we need to be more focused on the needs of women and children. We have already initiated our efforts for the specific goods used by women and children.”
She said: “We have asked all the relief organisations to dispatch ration goods to rural parts of Sindh as they aren’t needed at the camps. We here at the camps need milk for children and products specifically used by women.”
PPP MPA from Malir Muhammad Sajid Jokhio shared the number of people moved in different Karachi districts from rural Sindh in less than a week and said the trend was likely to continue as the infrastructure, resources and livelihood resources in the rural areas had vanished in the recent floods and it would take time to get them rebuilt.
“In Malir district, some 25,000 flood victims from different Sindh areas are staying. According to a rough estimate, some 3,000 to 4,000 people [from rural Sindh] are arriving [Karachi] daily,” he said, suggesting: “We should set up a tent city along the Northern Bypass instead of offering them to stay in different parts of the city.”

13,"‘It’s premature to assess intensity, impact of floods as waters still coming’","Speakers highlight plight of millions of people affected due to heavy rain, flood","KARACHI: To assess the true picture of flooding in all the provinces of Pakistan, a webinar of dispatches from Sindh was held here on Monday in which speakers highlighted the plight of rain-hit people across the province.
They said that the government was showing lesser number of flood-affected people as around 10 million people had been affected due to the floods in Sindh alone.
However, they also agreed that it was premature to say anything about the intensity and impact of the flood since floodwaters were still coming.
Speaking at the event, which was organised by The Knowledge Forum (TKF), social activist Jan Odhano said that Sindh, besides dealing with its own flooding, is also getting the brunt of the flooding in Balochistan.

Speakers highlight plight of millions of people affected due to heavy rain, flood

“The districts of Sindh bordering Balochistan had their own rainwater flooding the area, but now a new situation has developed where they are hit by the flash floods from Balochistan too. And it is all affecting land, crops, livestock and the livelihood of people,” he said, adding that 90 per cent of the rice crop had been ruined, clay and straw homes have collapsed and where the homes had RCC roofs they were also unliveable because they were flooded.
“Riverine floods one still has inkling about, but the people here had no idea about the flash floods and the length of devastation from them so they didn’t take out their animals, which has increased their losses manifold,” he added.
Development expert Dr Sono Khanghrani was of the opinion that it was still premature to assess the intensity and impact of the floods as the waters were still coming.
“Still, if you compare the 2011 rains millimetre wise with these rains, the rain was less in 2011. But this time there is the mismanagement factor with landlords and people doing as they feel, making cuts in drains, digging ditches, etc, wherever they feel like,” he said.
He also said that the absence of international non-governmental organisations was also being felt.
“There were some 55 international NGOs which were made to pack up from Pakistan. Now, their partners who used to work in such situations are also not there anymore. The absence of relief agencies is also a major negative factor in this crisis. And the political people with influence are only looking out for their areas as people lose faith in them. The political angle only victimises,” he said.
About the impact of floods on livestock, he said that there has been a huge loss for which they have no estimate or numbers. But once the water drains out of the areas there will also be growth of fresh green grass.
“Still, people are cash-deprived and so they are selling their animals at throwaway prices right now,” he said.
Akram Khaskheli of the Hari Welfare Association said that the flood drains were also not strong enough due to which they developed breaches. “That is also why people didn’t get time to move their animals as they drowned,” he said.
He also pointed out that government estimates regarding losses due to the floods are not correct.
“According to our estimates, 10 million people have been affected due to the floods in Sindh alone. Government estimates show lesser numbers,” he said.
“The cotton crop was at its peak when the floods came. Only one time picking of cotton had been carried out after which the crop was ruined before the second picking. The sugar cane crop was also ruined and the wheat stored with the farmers has also been washed away. Now our food security is threatened,” he said.
“The government camps set up in school buildings have elderly folks, pregnant women and children. There are four to five families in single rooms which are also flooded with water. The same is the case with hospitals. And there is no electricity or gas in most of these places. Also, help has still not come to many due to lack of accessibility. Life is completely paralysed,” he said.
Radha Bheel of the Pakistan Dalit Solidarity Network, who works with scheduled castes, said that the scheduled castes work in agriculture so they are the worst hit by the floods as the crops have been ruined.
“These people could only save their children when the floods came and they have to run to save their lives,” she said.
She said that the people are only being helped by other people as there has been no help from the government for them.
“The government has not extended any help for the scheduled castes. Everyone is helping each other in whatever way they can. Some people are cooking food and distributing it, some are distributing medicines as no one could be rescued by the government in Mirpurkhas,” she said.
Other speakers included Dr Riaz Sheikh of Szabist, Uzma Noorani of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, Mohammed Yaqoob of Takhliq Foundation, Yasir Husain of Darya Lab, Zeenia Shaukat and Shujauddin Qureshi of the TKF.
