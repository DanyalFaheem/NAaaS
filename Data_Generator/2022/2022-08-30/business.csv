0,Zero foreign investment in domestic bonds in August,Outflow from T-bills in August was $0.92m.,"KARACHI: The high returns on treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) failed to attract a single dollar from foreign investors in the second month of the current fiscal year.
The data released by the State Bank of Pakistan on Monday showed zero inflow of foreign investment in T-bills and PIBs during August, while an investment of just $3 million was recorded in July against an outflow of $31.085m in the first month of FY23.
The high-yield domestic bonds are only making government borrowing costlier. A return of 15.79pc for 3-month T-bills, 17.85pc for 6-month and 19.94pc for 12-month is a good chance for financial institutions to make large profits but the government will have to pay a heavy cost as the share of debt servicing would eat up the major share of budget.
The data showed neither the T-bills nor PIBs could attract foreign investments while the outflow from T-bills in August was $0.924m.
In June, the last month of FY22, attracted $22m in T-bills while the outflow for the same was $62.8m. There wasn’t any inflow or outflow in PIBs.
The political uncertainty in the 2nd half of FY22 played a key role to keep the foreign investors away from Pakistan.
During the two months, March and April, no foreign investment was received in T-bills and PIBs which was mainly due to the highly uncertain political situation in Pakistan. Investments from both domestic bonds were withdrawn during this period by foreigners.
Since the change of government in Islamabad, the risks in the investments have been increasing while the massive appreciation of the dollar against the local currency and great fluctuations in the exchange rate discouraged investors’ sentiments.
The short-term three-month T-bills rate was higher than the policy rate of 15pc but the bankers said the devaluation of local currency is a serious hurdle in attracting foreign investment in T-bills.
The disastrous impact of floods has yet not come visible in the economy despite food prices going up which will certainly push inflation higher than the government’s estimates. The government and the State Bank of Pakistan estimate that the inflation may go up to 19pc during FY23 but will start easing in FY24. 
Bankers believe that the higher inflation would force the central bank to increase the interest rate which would further increase the T-bills and PIBs rates. However, bankers maintain that foreign investors will remain away until the IMF resumes loans, other creditors release funds for Pakistan and the foreign exchange reserves of the country see a vital positive change.

1,Industry rejects hike in electricity tariffs,"Demands withdrawal of power tariff hike, fuel adjustment charges.","KARACHI: The leadership of the Businessmen Group (BMG) and the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry rejected an unprecedented increase in electricity tariffs of up to 80 per cent on Monday, saying it had created a miserable situation not only for the public but also for the business community.
At a press conference, BMG Chair­man Zubair Motiwala and KCCI President Muhammad Idrees demanded the withdrawal of the power tariff hike, fuel adjustment charges, and reintroduction/incre­ase in fixed charges so that the industries and consumers could survive.
They expressed grave concerns that the base tariff has been raised by Rs9.8972 per unit, which has jacked up the per unit cost from Rs19 to around Rs30 per unit, indicating an unprecedented hike of 50pc. “This has increased the base tariff for electricity by Rs30 per unit, which is subjected to 17pc sales tax, excise duty, and income tax. If all these components are combined, an unbearable minimum impact of 65pc to 80pc would appear in the electricity bills,” the business leaders said. 
They feared that if electricity tariffs continue to go up at the same pace, the per unit tariff may reach anywhere between Rs55 and Rs65 in the next couple of months.
They said variant tariffs have once again been restored for the industries under the policy of peak and off-peak hours, which was suspended in the past, and a uniform tariff was applicable throughout the day so that the industries could carry on their production at full capacity without any interruption.
The restoration of peak and off-peak hours would create a very difficult situation for the industries as they would either have to curtail their production or suspend operations during peak hours and then reengage labour for the resumption of pending work during the remaining non-peak hours. It happens only in Pakistan, where such a mess usually surfaces due to poor decisions and policy-making by the National Electric and Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), which never listens to consumers and only fully facilitates distribution companies. 
They appealed to Prime Minister Shebaz Sharif to look into Nepra’s matters as many decisions taken by Nepra were purely against the consumers and, in recent history, the regulator has never favoured the consumers. Consumers’ points of view were never taken seriously at the so-called public hearing. Nepra’s rules must be redefined and a consumer representative must also be included in Nepra’s panel for public hearings.
They noted that the industries of Karachi were paying at least Rs10 more than what was being charged by the industries in Peshawar, which was sheer discrimination.
They said fixed charges were unacceptable, which would further increase the cost of doing business because fixed charges were applicable as per load on operational and inoperative industries, which, instead of being encouraged to reactivate operations, would be compelled to stay closed.
They said the government should come forward and provide relief by pardoning electricity bills for a period of at least two months with a view to supporting the flood-affected people during the relief and rehabilitation activities.

The dollar closed at Rs221.92 in the interbank market from Rs220.66 the previous session, reported the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). However, the currency dealers reported the dollar price at Rs223. 
The currency dealers sell their surplus dollars in the interbank market.
The currency market was willing to hear any positive outcome of the talks with the IMF and friendly countries. 
The open market reported a dollar price of Rs230 which was much higher than the interbank market. This wide difference was due to a shortage of dollars in the open market.

5,Regulatory body being set up to resolve demurrage issues: KPT chief,Says business community will soon be invited to KPT head office where cut in demurrage charges will be announced.,"KARACHI: The Karachi Port Trust (KPT) plans to establish a regulatory authority shortly to determine the demurrage charges at the port and resolve related issues, said KPT Chairman Muhammad Tariq Huda on Monday.
Addressing the luncheon held at the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (Kati), Mr Huda said he was trying to reduce the demurrage charges but could not do so due to some unavoidable reasons, a Kati press release said.
The business community will soon be invited to the KPT head office where a cut in demurrage charges would formally be announced, he announced. 
He added that all the containers were stopped at the port after the government placed an import ban on May 19 due to which demurrage charges were incurred. However,  the government has now allowed the clearing of all stuck-up boxes.
According to the Kati press release, the KPT chairman claimed that since 2002, no port charges had been increased. However, employee salaries and other administrative expenses have increased. This is the reason why the operating profit and revenue are equal. In the past, KPT’s profit was high and many development projects were completed including the KPT flyover, underpass, and other projects.
He added that due to a lack of budget, it is difficult to bear the expenses of development projects. Now is the time to take concrete steps to increase the income of KPT.
“We will start Pakistan’s single window operation which will provide facilities to importers and exporters,” said Mr Huda.
If the Pipri railway track is completed, 100 containers can be cleared from the port immediately. Apart from this, the elimination of marine pollution also becomes our responsibility to take all possible measures. KPT is throwing 8,000 tonnes of garbage into the sea every day, which has increased the pollution, he said.

6,UIC launches life insurance company,Parent company will invest up to Rs700m in proposed life insurance firm.,"KARACHI: The United Insurance Company of Pakistan Ltd, a general insurance provider, announced on Monday it’s going to launch a life insurance business.
A regulatory filing said the proposed name of the entity will be The United Life Assurance Company Ltd. The parent company will invest up to Rs700 million in the proposed life insurance firm.
“Life insurance is a highly under-penetrated market in Pakistan. The penetration rate is one of the lowest in the region, which shows there’re opportunities for existing and new players,” said Amreen Soorani, head of research at JS Global, while speaking to Dawn.
Life insurance penetration, which reflects premiums as a percentage of GDP, has barely inched up in the last many years. It currently stands at only 0.6 per cent, significantly lower than prevailing rates in comparable economies.
As opposed to roughly 30 firms engaged in the general insurance business, only 10 life insurance companies operate in Pakistan. This is despite the fact that growth in the life insurance segment has been considerably higher than that in general insurance.
Life insurance is a “bundled proposition” in which people invest for 10 to 20 years for protection against death or disability while accumulating “disciplined savings” for a specific purpose like children’s education or retirement.
Traditionally, the customer focus in Pakistan has been on the savings aspect. That’s because the agency sales force of all life insurers invariably sells savings-oriented policies. Insurance sold through banks, commonly known as bancassurance, is also geared completely towards products that revolve around the savings aspect.
But the post-coronavirus years have made people more concerned about their future, according to insurance industry analysts.
Given the overwhelming size of three major players — State Life, EFU Life and Jubilee Life — in the life insurance business, smaller entities have found it increasingly difficult to carve out a bigger slice of the overall business pie for themselves.
According to the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), which regulates the insurance business, the private sector is “pushing up on its role” within the life insurance sector. As evidence, it cites the market share of State Life, which came down from around 70pc in 2010 to 51pc in 2021.
“The major contributor in any economy should by and large be the private sector. However, in the developing economies such as ours, public-sector entities have historically played a more dominant role... the concern of the SECP revolves around the financial stability of life insurers to meet their financial obligations, as and when they fall due, through the test of solvency,” it said in an earlier emailed statement to Dawn.

Weekly inflation, which is measured by the Sensitive Price Index, increased at the record pace during the week ending on Aug 25. Prices of essential daily-use items rose 44.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis mainly because of higher prices of fuel and tomatoes, onions, pulses and cooking oil.

8,Floods inflict $10bn losses across Pakistan,"Standing cotton, rice crops in Sindh destroyed; provincial government waives Abiana charges.","KARACHI: The federal government has estimated a loss of at least $10 billion caused by weeks of torrential rains and subsequent floods, with Sindh, in particular, suffering damages of over $1.6bn (Rs355bn) as all major crops have been destroyed.
Speaking to the media, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail shared the damages estimate, saying the economic impact of floods would be at least $10bn, which is roughly translated to three per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.
Meanwhile, Sindh CM Adviser on Agriculture Manzoor Wassan told Dawn that the heavy rains had destroyed cotton, rice, and date crops, causing a loss of Rs109.347bn. “Besides, chilli and other crops have also been destroyed by rain,” he added.
Mr Wasan said that almost the entire cotton crop standing on over 1.4 million acres, rice standing on 602,120 acres and dates on 101,379 acres had been destroyed. “Almost 50pc of the sugarcane crop on 729,582 acres has also been damaged,” he said.

Standing cotton, rice crops in Sindh destroyed; provincial government waives Abiana charges 

Giving details of other crops damaged by heavy rains in the province, he said that almost 50pc of other crops of sesame, tomato, chilli, Kharif vegetables and onion had also been destroyed.
To a question, he said that there would be a great deal of difficulty in sowing wheat, which was due in the next two months. “The flood water is not expected to be completely drained out of the farmers’ fields in two months,” he added.
He said that there were unprecedented rains in Sindh, but the provincial government was doing its best to provide relief to the people affected by rains and flash floods.
The agriculture adviser said that he had distributed more than 4,000 tents, tarpaulins, ration bags and cash among the affected people.
He said that the farmers had incurred huge losses and they would be given relief to bear these losses. Revenue charges (Abiana) would be waived for kharif season 2022 by the revenue department, he added.
Mr Wassan said that date palm growers had lost their entire crop. “It has been proposed that case compensation may be given to them at 50pc of their crop value.
He said that a compensation package for the rest of the crops damaged during the torrential rains might be announced on a 50pc input cost basis, including seed, fertiliser, and pesticides.
To a question, he said that agricultural loans provided to the growers during Kharif 2022 in rain-affected areas might be rescheduled and the interest on the loans might be waived.
“New interest-free loans for rain-affected areas may be provided on easy terms,” he added.
Mr Wassan said that efforts were being made to protect the crops by extracting water from the fields. 
“We are with people and we can’t leave them alone in these hard days,” he vowed.
