Talking to Dawn, local Allah Bukhsh said it was gypsum excavation site Daharzain. The mineral department used to issue licence of excavation of gypsum to people. The large-scale excavation of gypsum has weakened the adjacent mountain which resulted in landsliding and forming lake of sweet water. “The lake is a source of sweet water as there is scarcity of drinking water.”

3,Acute shortage of Panadol perpetuates patients pain in Punjab,Punjab health authorities claim drug is not in short supply anywhere in the province.,"LAHORE: The months-long shortage of the widely used over-thea-counter (OTC) drug – paracetamol – has intensified hardships of the patients as they are unable to purchase it even at double price.
Particularly, the shortage of Panadol [tablets] has hit the province hard and the situation is getting from bad to worse due to the resurgence of dengue and Covid infections as medics prescribe it to relieve pain and control fever.
On the other hand, the Punjab health authorities seem ‘indifferent’ to the plight of the patients, claiming that the drug is not in short supply anywhere in the province.
Panadol is the most selling brand all over the country and Punjab has been at the top among other provinces where the demand of the drug remains high.  
The health professionals say the paracetamol is a generic name of the drug which is prescribed to control fever.  
They claim that several multinational and national pharmaceutical companies are manufacturing paracetamol under more than 300 generic names but the local medics largely prescribe Panadol brand.
Though many of the other generic medicines have also disappeared from the market, the acute shortage of Panadol [tablets] for the last five to six months in Lahore and other cities has created a crisis-like situation.  
Some medical experts are of the view that the the black market of the drug is the main reason for its artificial shortage.
They allege that some senior officials in the Directorate of Health Services Punjab are also involved in this respect.
An official says the drug has disappeared from the local markets due to two major reasons - the non-availability of the raw material in the international markets and the low price of the medicine as the manufacturers claim that they are unable to afford the expenses due to volatility in the dollar rate.  
He says the multinational and national pharmaceutical companies purchase raw material from China and America to manufacture the drug locally.  
He says the Chinese companies have stopped the export of raw material to the Asian countries due to the closure of some plants in the wake of the environmental policy.
Consequently, they have restricted export to the Middle East and other countries only, he says, adding that the manufacturers in Pakistan are finding it hard to meet the growing requirement of the medicine.  
The low price of the drug is another major reason as the federal cabinet has rejected four times the proposal/summary to increase the prices, the official says.  
He said though the manufacturing of the paracetamol drugs has been reduced considerably, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure its uninterrupted supply/provision to patients.
He says the Punjab health officials should abandon the practice of concealing the facts about the shortage of the drug in the market. “The health department should raise the genuine and serious concerns of the patients with the federal government to bring about a permanent solution by ensuring supply of the drug in the market according to its demand.”

4,"Quirky, modern desserts evoke nostalgia with traditional taste",Ever thought how a paan macaron would taste like? Or a sheer khurma panna cotta? Or a chocolate-filled gulab jaman?...,"Ever thought how a paan macaron would taste like? Or a sheer khurma panna cotta? Or a chocolate-filled gulab jaman? Sounds bizarre, right? Well, a home-based chef and culinary instructor in Lahore has not only conceived such ideas, and many more like these, but also gone ahead and executed them.  
Chef Sidra Shahid recently posted a few fascinating pictures of one of her most recent creations, a chum-chum panna cotta, on an online food group. And as is the case with such forums, there were varied responses, from confusion to applause to outright rejection of a beloved traditional sweetmeat. However, she takes it in her stride. After all, running a food business, especially one that offers modern, quirky fusion of desi desserts, was bound to be risky.  
So when and how did she even come up with the idea of such a business? “The inspiration behind changing desi cuisine and taking it to the next level came from my foreign travels, especially Europe and UAE, where Pakistani food wasn’t readily available and everybody associated South Asian food with India. Even in a place like Dubai, there are so many Michelin star Indian chefs. And then I had been watching Masterchef Australia since its first season, which inspired me the most to transform and modernise our desserts,” Sidra tells Dawn at her residence where she operates her business and conducts cooking classes from. 
Cooking since 10-12 years of age, she credits Masterchef as being her “first culinary school” that inculcated the interest in her and made her realise what her true calling was. After completing pre-engineering and then business degrees, when she wanted to go abroad to train in culinary skills, she wasn’t allowed to. It was only after marriage and travelling to Europe where she took a few classes from Italian home chefs that she returned and started a small business with basic Italian and French dishes, seven years ago.  



 
Besides that, due to a lack of awareness, as she claims, she also thought of teaching such dishes to educate people about European cuisine. Now, Sidra runs both her classes and business through her instagram pages @CookingClasses101 and @ChefBehindTheSpecs.
But it was only five years ago that she made her first fusion dessert – a chocolate-filled gulab jaman, inspired by the molten lava cake. “After receiving an amazing response, I started picking our desserts, and made a list of those I could play with and that had the potential to be modernised through French and other new techniques like our mithai, gajar ka halwa, sheer khurma etc. When it comes to desserts, it’s like a chemistry practical; you have to be precise with measurements. I also get to show my creativity, and can also break some rules, as there’s not much room to play with in savoury.” 
The pastry chef explains that the process behind transforming a local dessert first entails its anatomy, dissecting all the ingredients that go into it and then researching how those components could play together to form and shape an all-new modern dessert, retaining the original taste. 
“My chum-chum creation has a panna cotta that has a mellow mithai taste, but when combined with white chocolate coconut mousse, coconut crème anglaise and cardamom Chantilly, it gives a burst of flavours as if one’s eating a chum-chum. The idea is to taste every element together to bring that traditional feel; that’s the beauty of modern desserts. I want to evoke nostalgia, yet present something fresh and unique. Senses play an important role in tasting,” she explains. 
Her portfolio of adventurous, eccentric, eye-popping desserts includes a Pistachio Kheer Tart made up of kheer crème diplomat (whipped cream and custard), pistachio short crust, pistachio praline and pistachio brittle. And only when all of these elements are popped into the mouth together will it taste like a traditional rice kheer. Then there’s Kheer Crème Brulee that isn’t baked as a traditional brulee but slow cook on stove; Motichoor Laddoo Rabri Parfait that comprises a modern take on the rabri, cream, laddoo crumble and saffron cream cheese mousse; Masala Chai Tiramisu inspired by the classic and popular chai-biscuit concept containing tea biscuits, mascarpone cheese, tea and assorted masalas; the Ras Malai Tres Leches; Gajar ka Halwa Cheesecake; Kesar Badam Rabri Macarons and many more.
However, these distinctive ideas did face their share of backlash and judgement from the ‘foodies’ of Lahore. “People make fun by just looking at the picture let alone tasting it. A lot of time is spent on R&D about how a recipe is going to work. There’s a lot of taste and trial to make sure a dessert turns out exactly the way I want it to. So, the backlash has been consistent, especially in case of the paan macarons,” she laughs.  
Through her unusual dessert combinations, Sidra aims to make fusion acceptable, pretty much relying on local products, except chocolate.  
“It’s always the technique that matters, such as cold and hot infusion. I use 95pc local products to ensure consistency. The next desserts I’m working on are transforming doodh jalebi and chilli milli,” she says.

MPA Yasin Sohal and Ahsan Raza Khan appeared before an additional district and sessions judge, who heard the bail as duty judge, along with their counsel.
The judge granted them pre-arrest bail subject to furnishing of surety bonds of Rs100,000 each.
Chuhng police had registered an FIR against several leaders and 58 nominated workers of the PML-N. Initially, the police included the offences under the PPC in the case and later also added the offence under Section 7 of ATA.
Several PML-N leaders obtained bails in the case, however, many others including Ms Nawaz, Javed Latif, Muhammad Zubair, Pervaiz Rashid, Daniyal Aziz, Uzma Bokhari, Sania Ashiq, Hina Pervaiz Butt and Irfan Shafi Khokhar have not so far secured the bail.
ESCAPE: A suspect on Monday managed to escape police arrest after a sessions court dismissed his interim pre-arrest bail in a rape case.
Sattukatla police had registered an FIR against Muneeb Asim on the charge of sexually assaulting an orphan girl.
A counsel for the suspect argued before the court that the case against his client was fabricated and baseless. He asked the court to confirm the pre-arrest bail of the petitioner.
Advocate Mian Dawood appeared on behalf of the complainant girl and argued that the DNA examination of the suspect was yet to be conducted while the police investigation also found him guilty.
He said the police possessed complete record against the suspect, including videos of the complainant which the suspect made to blackmail her. He said the conduct of the suspect before the court was also dubious as he changed at least seven counsel since he secured the interim bail in June.
After hearing both sides, the court dismissed the bail petition of the suspect, however, he managed to escape in the presence of the police personnel.

7,Report of deal with Qatar rubbished: Lawyer withdraws plea after LHC warns him of fine,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday dismissed as withdrawn a petition challenging the alleged likely...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday dismissed as withdrawn a petition challenging the alleged likely ‘deal’ with Qatar reportedly for selling 51pc shares of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and handing over the administrative control of the national flag carrier and the Islamabad International Airport to the Gulf state. 
Nabeel Ahmad Kahloon, a lawyer with expertise in aviation laws, had filed the petition, saying that during a recent visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Qatar, a massive investment had been pledged by Doha in Pakistan’s aviation sector. 
At the outset of the petition’s hearing, an additional attorney general told the court that no such deal was under consideration of the government. 
Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan observed that the lawyer (Kahloon) had filed the petition on the basis of media reports only. He asked the lawyer to withdraw the petition or facea fine. 
Kahloon opted to withdraw his petition and the judge dismissed the same as withdrawn. 
The petitioner had contended that, as per reports, Qatar expressed its interest in making investments in the airport and hotel sectors. 
He said that under the ‘deal’ the federal government would hand over administrative affairs of the Islamabad International Airport to Qatar whereas a Qatari company would provide the relevant services of the airport’s terminal and cargo. 
The petitioner submitted that the Qatari government would also be given shares of the PIA’s Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan, New York, in return for the investment, which would be received through state-to-state agreements between Pakistan and Qatar. He further submitted that the worth of Islamabad airport’s land was around Rs4tr, besides the revenue being generated out of it. 
He argued that the government, while signing such a deal with the gulf country should keep the commercial potential of the land in mind. 
Kahloon explained that the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules would apply to all financial transactions since both the PIA and the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority were federal government entities. He argued that the federal government did not get approval of the parliament before making the impugned deals for the Qatar investments whereas the PIA had been converted into a public limited company through the PIA Conversion Act 2016, passed by the parliament. 
The lawyer said any such impugned deal and sale of the national nag carrier needed approval of the parliament through amendment to the relevant law. 
The petitioner asked the court to declare the impugned deals by the government regarding sale of the PIA shares and surrendering administrative control of the Islamabad airport to Qatar as illegal.

“Lahore’s master plan is at a final stage, and will identify the needs and address the commercial and industrial issues and other civic problems,” Provincial Minister for Housing, Urban Development, Industry and Commerce Mian Aslam Iqbal said at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) on Monday.
The minister said the land in Muzaffargarh has been identified for the establishment of the industrial zone. He also pledged for creating a business-friendly environment in Punjab be the top priority of the government. 
“All possible measures are being taken in this regard. The government and private sector must be on one page to keep the wheel of trade and industry moving,” he added. It may be mentioned that the Lahore Development Authority had earlier in May, this year launched the second round of consultation for the master Plan through public notices and hearings in a bid to get more viable and logical input from the public at large. 
In the first round, the LDA, in association with various stakeholders, organised four public hearings in Lahore - one each in Kasur, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib - besides inviting suggestions from the public through public notices on the master plan. In the first round, the authority received over 20 suggestions from the people. The minister, on demand of the LCCI, said the chamber would be given representation in the trade and industry-related departments. He claimed that 1,450 new factories have been set up in small industrial estates in the last three and a half years.
The initial draft master plan-2050 projected addition of 12.6 million in the existing population of the provincial metropolitan in the next 28 years for which housing and accommodation of around nine million people within the administrative boundaries of Lahore city district and the remaining 3.6m outside it has been recommended.
The planning policies adopted for the preparation of the master plan propose to accommodate approximately nine million people (of the total 12.6 million projected population) within the administrative boundaries of the Lahore district while allowing very limited horizontal expansion adjacent to existing urban areas. 
Since any further adjustment of the population will affect the green area of Lahore district, the remaining 3.6 million people, as per the plan, will be accommodated outside the administrative boundary of Lahore district on the northern side,” reads the plan. 
It states that since the future development in Lahore and the districts of Kasur, Nankana Sahib and Sheikhupura will be in accordance with the policies of the government at the national and provincial level, the LDA, in principle, has approved the proposed planning policies/scenarios subject to the condition that all further actions will be taken as per law, rules and policy in vogue and in consultation with all stakeholders.
Talking to Dawn, a senior LDA official said the final draft of the Lahore division master plan-2050 would be ready very soon.  
“We will submit it to the LDA management next month. After this, the management would send it to an internal review committee. After being reviewed and go ahead from this committee, the plan would be sent to the provincial scrutiny committee headed by secretary housing,” he explained, adding that after being cleared by the scrutiny committee, the plan would be sent to the LDA’s governing body for final approval, after which it would be notified and enforced.

The former PM praised the the former CM in a public meeting in Jhelum on Saturday. Next day, Adviser to Chief Minister on Information Omar Sarfraz Cheema said the Taunsa city had been protected due to timely measures taken by the Punjab government. 
A ‘sizeable’ dyke was constructed on the southern bank of Sanghar hill torrent. The structure is meant to protect a newly-built stadium, zoo and some official buildings.  
The embankment did protect the new structures it was supposed to do but caused flooding in the upstream areas. Mangrotha and Sokar, two oldest towns of the region, were inundated owing to obstruction in the torrent flow. The dyke reduced one-third of riverbed of Sanghar and hence caused overflowing in upstream areas. 
Taunsa AC Muhammad Asad Chandia said flooding in the Mangrotha and Sokar towns was due to exceptionally high flood of 268,000 cusecs in the Sanghar hill torrent. He said the dyke in question had protected Taunsa city as well. 
Mushtaq Gadi, a representative of intelligentsia in Taunsa, said the dyke was constructed almost in the middle of Sanghar bed and it obstructed the natural flow of water and ultimately inundated Mangrotha and Sokar through Jam Wah water channel. 
Prof Muhammad Khan, a resident of Taunsa, told Dawn the dyke was not properly designed and constructed.

17,Pilac to promote parallel Punjabi theatre,"LAHORE: The Punjab Institute of Language, Art and Culture (Pilac) will dedicate its auditorium only for parallel...","LAHORE: The Punjab Institute of Language, Art and Culture (Pilac) will dedicate its auditorium only for parallel theatre plays, especially in the Punjabi language, to promote the rich tradition and culture of Punjab, officials told Dawn on Monday.
Officials said that no commercial theatre activity would be held at Pilac auditorium and only parallel theatre would be promoted. Pilac has already stopped entertaining commercial theatre at the auditorium. Now, the institute has decided to promote only parallel theatre to promote and encourage young upcoming parallel theatre groups.
Pilac Director-General Dr Sughra Sadaf in a chat with Dawn said that the decision would promote young artists, especially those working on Punjabi and promoting Punjabi literature and language. She said Pilac will write to drama societies of different colleges and universities, drama clubs and private parallel theatre groups to come up with their proposals on different productions they were interested in doing on the stage.
She said collaborative stage productions would be staged by collaboration between Pilac and interested groups. “We will announce a special award for the best artist of the year and also for the best director and playwright,” she said.
About Pilac’s plan to stage cult classics, written by the likes of Envar Sajjad, Bano Qudsia, Mumtaz Mufti and Ashfaq Ahmad, Ms Sadaf said, “We shall definitely stage classics, but shall translate some classic pieces into Punjabi and will offer different clubs or societies to stage those works.”
She said the youth was so interested in presenting their talent through theatre, the strongest medium when it comes to performing arts. Ms Sadaf said that pertaining to parallel theatre, Pilac will also design a yearly parallel theatre festival in which different parallel theatre stakeholders will be invited to be part of the festival.
“Pilac planned a theatrical activity in September, however, owing to this natural calamity of floods where the whole nation is in distress to see all these areas wreaked by floods, we have now decided to hold the activity somewhere in November,” she added.
LAC: The Information and Culture Department has proposed a new board of governors for the Lahore Arts Council (LAC) for three years, sources in the department told Dawn.
The proposed names in the board will be sent for approval to the minister for culture and to the chief secretary, Punjab, and later on for final approval to the chief minister.  
This year the names which have been proposed are Muhammad Ali Baloch, Attaul Haq Qasmi, Mian Nauman Kabir, Irfan Gill, Javed Iqbal, Prof Dr Rahat Naveed Masud, RM Naeem, Tariq Saeed Sehgal, Gohar Ijaz, Sajida Haider Vandal, Asghar Nadeem Syed, Amjad Islam Amjad, Sohail Sarwar Warraich, Asif Raza Sana and Shoaib Bin Aziz.
The six official members will be the secretary to the information and culture, the deputy commissioner, the Lahore PTV general manager, the principal of the College of Art and Design, University of Punjab, and the executive director of the Lahore Arts Council.
Among the non-official members, the chairman of the board would be elected. To many art critics, the proposed board does not have any performing artists or journalists who report art and culture. There is an issue of relevance when it comes to the board. There are four visual artists on the proposed board -- Mr Naeem, Mr Masud, Mr Iqbal and Ms Vandal and four writers and poets Mr Syed, Mr Amjad, Mr Aziz and Mr Qasmi. Mr Qasmi also is the former chairman of the board.
However, the proposed board does not have any performing art artists or senior journalists who write on culture. Both performing artists and cultural journalists are the most relevant entities for the board.
Watercolourist and art historian Dr Ajaz Anwar commented on the disproportion in the board of governors of the LAC, saying, “We’re a nation of quakes as we like to be experts in every other field rather than ours.” He said that arts councils are meant for cultural activities, therefore the board should have artists and relevant people from journalism.
Visual artist and art educationist Saleema Hashmi said, “The original vision of the Board of Lahore Arts Council is to represent all the arts, the visual and performing arts, literary people and the people who write on art.”

20,"35,000 government employees await plots in PGSHF schemes",Foundation hasn’t got required land; it developed schemes in 11 cities since 2004.,"LAHORE: A retired headmaster, Chaudhry Muhammad Ashraf, from Faisalabad has submitted his share long ago to get a plot in the housing scheme of the Punjab Government Servants Housing Foundation (PGSHF) but he is still waiting for his piece of land. 
In a complaint, a copy available with Dawn, submitted to the chief secretary against the foundation, he states that he and other allottees had submitted their share but the society was not developed on time and the allottees were waiting to construct houses on plots for several years. 
He said the behaviour of the managing director of the foundation was also not good towards the allottees who were being forced to sell the file or plot. 
Another allottee, Ghulam Sabir Ansari, also submitted the complaint, saying he had retired from service 10 years ago and was not given possession of the plot. He said he was allotted Plot 63-B in Satiana Road scheme in Faisalabad but he could not construct a house on the plot as he did not have its possession and no one from the foundation was paying heed to his grievance. He said he had spent all his hard-earned money to get the map of the house passed but he was not allowed to construct the house. 

Foundation hasn’t got required land; it developed schemes in 11 cities since 2004 

Ashraf and Ansari are not alone in their predicament as the PGSHF, according to sources, has failed to provide residential plots and houses to over 35,000 government employees who have retired since 2006. 
The foundation was established as a corporate body under the Punjab Government Servants Housing Foundation Act 2004 on March 10, 2004, to introduce schemes for providing houses or plots on the basis of no profit, no loss to government servants on their retirement or to their families in case of death during service. The foundation is managed by a board of directors (BoD), headed by the Punjab chief secretary, including seven ex-officio members. 
All provincial government employees are eligible for its membership and membership opportunity was offered to every Punjab Government Servant in 2004-05. A government employee has to apply to get a membership and to be eligible to get a plot of land or house. The new memberships are closed. 
According to the rules, the provision of land is to be ensured by the Punjab government for establishment of housing schemes. 
The PGSHF had to provide houses or plots on a no-profit, no-loss basis to all members after retirement and allotment was to be done as per seniority based on date of retirement/death and priority of the station. The transfer of ownership rights was to be given upon taking possession and permission to sell house/plot three months after taking the possession. 
The foundation has established housing schemes in 11 districts of the province, namely Lahore, Bahawalpur, Dera Ghazi Khan, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Multan, Rawalpindi, Sahiwal, Sargodha, Sialkot and Khanewal. 
A foundation employee, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn that the foundation was not giving plots or houses to around 35,000 employees who retired from service from 2006 till date. He said the foundation had to give a plot or house to the employees retiring in 2006 till 2016 but it could not do the needful till this day.
PGSHF Managing Director Naheed Gul Baloch has confirmed that more than 35,000 retired employees are waiting to get plots and houses. 
She told Dawn that she had a meeting with Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi on Aug 18 and gave him a detailed briefing on the matter. She revealed the foundation did not have the required land to give plots or construct houses for the employees and thousands of cases were pending.  
Ms Baloch claimed that thousands of people had got possession of the plots in the PGSHF schemes and added that the foundation had reported the matter to the government. She said the foundation would get the required land soon and start giving plots to the employees again. 
Earlier, CM Parvez Elahi also ordered the PGSHF to take expeditious measures to dispose of the pending allotment cases, saying the welfare of the public servants was among his priorities. He maintained that it was the right of a government servant to get a house at the time of his/her retirement. 
The CM issued directions for provision of education and health facilities in the Government Servants Housing Schemes also. He sought provision of facilities to the government servants by completely developing the schemes and added that the burden of payment on the government servants should also be kept to the minimum. 
The CM said after the allotment of pending plots, the proposal to grant new memberships would also be reviewed.
