The 33-match tournament is a curtain raiser for the 2022-23 men’s domestic cricket season and will be followed by Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (first-class) and Pakistan Cup (one-day).
The National T20 Cup 2022-23 will be played in two legs. Rawalpindi’s Pindi Cricket Stadium will host the first 16 matches till Sept 7 and then the action will move to the Multan Cricket Stadium, where the remaining matches will be held from Sept 10-19.
Led by Khalid Usman, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the defending champions, will enter the tournament with the mission of securing a hat-trick of titles after winning the 2020-21 and 2021-22 editions. They have won 15 of their last 24 matches and begin their campaign on Aug 31 when they play Central Punjab.
Yasir Shah-led Balochistan enter the tournament with confidence as they ended the previous season on a high by winning the Pakistan Cup. Since playing the final of the 2019-20 edition of the tournament, Balochistan have failed to make it to the semi-finals and that’s what they would look to change when they face Central Punjab on the opening day of the tournament.
Central Punjab suffered defeat at the hands of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Lahore last season, thanks to Iftikhar Ahmed’s whirlwind 19-ball 45 not out in the final. It was the first instance of the side making it to the final after they failed to qualify for the semi-finals in 2019-20 and 2020-21. All-rounder Faheem Ashraf leads them this season.
Northern were champions of the first National T20 played following the revamp of the domestic structure. They lifted the trophy at the Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad, by thumping Balochistan in the final. They have been one of the most consistent teams in the tournament, making it to the semi-finals in the last two editions. Under the captaincy of Umar Amin, their aim must be to start good at their home, Rawalpindi, and go the distance when the tournament moves to Multan.
Southern Punjab had a last-minute change of guard after Hasan Ali was called up to the national side for the ongoing T20 Asia Cup in the UAE. All-rounder Salman Ali Agha, who made his Test and ODI debuts recently, has been handed the reins in the absence of the star pacer. Southern Punjab had a memorable 2020-21 campaign in which they fell 10 runs short of winning the title, but showed great grit and determination in making it to the final. Sohaib Maqsood’s stunning 81 off 29 scripted an epic run chase when they scaled the 162-run target in 10.4 overs against Balochistan to secure a spot in the semi-final, where they beat Northern by seven wickets. They couldn’t make it to the last four in the previous edition and will be hoping to stage a resounding comeback.
Led by Saud Shakeel, Sindh play the first match of the National T20 Cup when they take on Southern Punjab tomorrow. Following a lacklustre 2019-20 edition, Sindh have made it to the top four and played semi-finals in the last two tournaments.
To ensure the players participating in the tournament get their due share of exposure and fans get to enjoy the action-packed matches, the double-headers from Aug 30 till Sept 11 have been scheduled in a manner that they do not clash with the Asia Cup T20.
The first match of the day commences at 0930 and the second at 1400. From Sept 12, the first of the two matches will start at 1500, while the second will begin at 1930.

Neymar’s 70th minute penalty came after a VAR rev­iew and cancelled out Kevin Volland’s 20th minute goal. 
Neymar rolled in his eighth goal in five matches this season from a penalty awarded when the VAR alerted the on-pitch referee to a foul on the Brazilian by Monaco defender Guillermo Maripan midway through the second half. 
Monaco had taken the lead when Volland burst forward, holding off Presnel Kimpembe, before firing past Gianluigi Donnar­umma at the Parc des Princes. 
“We had difficulties in the first half against a European-level opponent but we deserved to win the game based on our second-half showing,” PSG coach Christophe Galtier told broadcaster Amazon Prime. 
The champions lead the standings with 10 points from four matches. They are level on points with Olympique de Marseille and Racing Lens. 
New signing Alexis Sanchez scored twice as Marseille won 3-0 at Nice earlier on Sunday while Lens were home winners over Stade Rennes on Saturday. 
Olympique Lyon scored a 86th minute equaliser though Moussa Dembele as they drew 1-1 at Stade Reims. Lyon are fourth with seven points. 
Montpellier snapped a two-match losing run as they secured their biggest ever Ligue 1 victory by thumping Stade Brest 7-0 despite the absence of suspended captain Teji Savanier.
Elye Wahi and Valere Germain both scored twice, while Pierre Lees-Melou was sent off for Brest, whose coach Michel Der Zakarian was formerly in charge of Montpellier. 
Lorient moved up to fifth place as they edged Clermont 2-1 with two first half goals from Terem Moffi, including an early penalty. 
After three successive defeats, Troyes beat Angers 3-1, with goals from Renaud Ripart, Mama Balde and Wilson Odobert to record their first points of the campaign. 
Nantes came from a goal down to secure a 3-1 win over Toulouse. Evann Gues­sand, Mostafa Mohamed and Moses Simon netted for Nantes.

3,Hockey legend Manzoor Jr passes away in Lahore,LAHORE: Pakistan hockey legend and national chief selector Manzoor Hussain Jr passed away due to cardiac arrest here...,"LAHORE: Pakistan hockey legend and national chief selector Manzoor Hussain Jr passed away due to cardiac arrest here at the local hospital on Monday. 
The 63-year-old was laid to rest later in the night after his funeral, which was attended by a number of people belonging to the country’s hockey fraternity.
A day earlier, Manzoor was taken to the hospital following chest pain before his health deteriorated further, resulting in his death. The news of the former Olympian’s passing away came as a shock to the sport’s community.
Manzoor — born in Sialkot in 1958 — bagged 86 goals in 175 outings for Pakistan in his international career that spanned from 1975-84.
Deemed one of the best right full-backs in the world during his playing days, he led the national side to a gold medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics.
Manzoor’s stick work, particularly how he used it dodge past defenders, was a treat to watch for hockey enthusiasts. He was part of the Pakistan sides which won gold medals in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, 1978 and 1982 Asian Games, the 1982 Asia Cup and the 1978 and 1980 Champions Trophy events. Manzoor also captained Pakistan to gold medal honours in the 1979 Junior World Cup. 
Manzoor was also decorated with Pride of Performance award in 1984. He took charge as the national side’s chief selector earlier this year before quitting from the post last month in protest after Pakistan Hockey Federation president Khalid Sajjad Khokhar instructed him to become the national junior team manager. 
Manzoor, however, was restored to his previous role and selected the senior squad that took part in the Common­wealth Games earlier this month.
Khokhar, along with PHF secretary Haider Hussain, former Olympians Samiullah Khan, Hasan Sardar, Shahnaz Shekh, Khalid Hameed, Tauqir Dar and Manzoor-ul-Hasan expressed condolences over his demise.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa, president Pakistan Olympic Association Lt. Gen. (retd.) Arif Hasan and secretary POA Khalid Mahmood also expressed condolences.

4,"Babar Azam rues lack of partnerships, hails debutant Naseem","""We were definitely short by 15 runs,"" he says about Asia Cup match against India.","DUBAI: In the end, with his pacers Naseem Shah and Haris Rauf suffering with cramps, Pakistan captain Babar Azam seemed powerless as India powered to a five-wicket victory in a last-over thriller in their Asia Cup Group ‘A’ opener on Sunday. 
After an explosive six-ball 16 from tailender Shahnawaz Dahani had rescued Pakistan from 128-9 to 147 all out, India rode on Hardik Pandya’s calm innings to grab victory with two balls to spare at the Dubai International Stadium. 
Babar admitted after the match that he felt Pakistan were 15 runs short.  
“Definitely, the way we started the game … we were definitely short by 15 runs on the day,” Babar rued during the post-match ceremony. 
Pakistan’s struggles began early on when Babar, their batting mainstay, failed to provide his side with a solid start. India used the short ball to great effect in the match and a similar delivery from Bhuvneshwar Kumar saw the back of Babar. 
With their captain back in the pavilion, Pakistan failed to recover and as wickets kept falling, the pressure rose until Shahnawaz hit two sixes to take Pakistan to a defendable total. 
“I think we didn’t have partnerships,” reflected Babar during the news conference after the game. “If we had built partnerships, there would’ve been pressure on the opposition...we just had small partnerships but needed a big one, like over 50 runs … That we definitely missed and what prevented us from getting more runs in the last few overs. 
“But I’m happy with the way the tail wagged and Shahnawaz and Haris got crucial runs in the end. The way Shahnawaz stepped up today was very impressive and we fought well after that.” 
Pakistan, indeed, had India on the ropes early on with debutant pacer Naseem Shah sending back Indian opener K.L. Rahul on the second ball of the innings and the 19-year-old nearly bagged the prized scalp of batting superstar Virat Kohli two balls later only for Fakhar Zaman to drop a difficult catch at second slip. 
Babar, who is missing pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi due to injury, was impressed by Naseem. 
“Fast bowlers are always pumped up and they are always aggressive,” Babar said. “The way he Naseem started, we didn’t feel that we were missing Shaheen … the way he bowled with the new ball and at the death was very impressive. It was his confidence that made him bowl like that.” 
After the early reprieve, the returning Kohli (35) and skipper Rohit Sharma (12) rebuilt India’s innings before left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz struck twice in two deliveries to dismiss the duo and put Pakistan back in the contest. 
Naseem, cramping badly, then clean bowled Suryakumar Yadav to put Pakistan on top but Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja steered India towards victory with a 52-run partnership. 
Pandya struck three fours in the penultimate over by Haris, who was also suffering from cramps in the Dubai heat, to leave India requiring seven runs of the final over. 
With his pacers having bowled out, Babar turned to Nawaz to bowl the final over and although he cleaned up Jadeja (35) on the first ball and held his own on the next two deliveries, Pandya (33 not out) smacked the fourth ball over the ropes to seal India’s victory. 
“The idea behind Nawaz bowling the final over was that we wanted to go deep and see how things panned out,” explained Babar. “The idea was to create pressure but Hardik finished well.”

5,Shaheen sent to London for treatment,LAHORE: After failing to rightly examine the nature of the knee injury suffered by national team pace spearhead...,"LAHORE: After failing to rightly examine the nature of the knee injury suffered by national team pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi and finding the rehab programme not progressing according to the plan, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has sent the player to London for treatment.
“The Pakistan Cricket Board today announced Shaheen Shah Afridi has departed for London where he will complete his rehabilitation,” a PCB media release said on Monday.
Commenting on the development, PCB’s chief medical officer Dr Najeebullah Soomro said: “Shaheen requires uninterrupted, dedicated knee specialist care and London offers some of the best sports medical and rehabilitation facilities in the world. In the best interest of the player, we have decided to send him there.
“The medical department will receive daily feedback on his progress whilst in London and we are confident Shaheen will regain full fitness before [this year’s] ICC T20 World Cup.”
Whilst in London, the 22-year-old Shaheen will remain under the supervision of the PCB Medical Advisory Panel, which also comprises London-based Dr Imtiaz Ahmad and Dr Zafar Iqbal.
Since 2016, Dr Imtiaz has been the Head of Medical Services at the Queens Park Rangers Football Club, while Dr Zafar is Head of Sports Medicine at the Crystal Palace Football Club since 2015, having worked previously with Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and Kent County Cricket Club.
Shaheen suffered a PCL injury in July while fielding during the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle. But the PCB medical panel decided to keep the left-armer with the national team, which at the end of the Sri Lanka tour, went to the Nether­lands to play three ODIs and directly came to the UAE to participate in the Asia Cup. The Asia Cup, which ends on Sept 11, will be followed by a seven-match T20 home series against England.
And now the sudden PCB decision to send Shaheen to London somehow indicates that his rehab process was not going on satisfactorily. The PCB medical panel had advised Shaheen 4-6 weeks rest in July, hoping he would return to the Pakistan team for the T20 World Cup being held in Aus­tralia during October-November.

6,"Pandya combines calmness, clarity  to be more effective",DUBAI: Hardik Pandya’s talent was never in doubt and the India all-rounder has now combined a calm mind with an...,"DUBAI: Hardik Pandya’s talent was never in doubt and the India all-rounder has now combined a calm mind with an uncluttered approach to emerge as a serious match-winner as he demonstrated in Sunday’s Asia Cup thriller against Pakistan. 
Emotions run high whenever India and Pakistan clash in a cricket match and many a player has buckled under the pressure that accompanies these contests between the arch-rivals. 
Pandya appeared cut from a different cloth though as he defied the mounting pressure in the closing stages of India’s nervy chase and secured victory with a nonchalant six with two balls to spare. 
The same calmness was evident in his muted celebration when he just did a fist bump with batting partner Dinesh Karthik, who bowed before Pandya. 
Pandya’s 3-25 with the ball and 33 not out off 17 deliveries made him an obvious choice for the man-of-the-match award. 
“In all these years I’ve understood that if I stay as calm as possible, it’s going to help me to execute all my plans,” the 28-year-old said after collecting the prize. 
“The 50-50 chances which I take, if I’m calmer, it helps me to pull it off.” 
Needing 21 runs from 12 balls, India looked in trouble but Pandya hit three boundaries in the penultimate over from Haris Rauf to ease the pressure. 
Spinner Mohammad Nawaz dismissed Ravindra Jadeja with the first ball of the final over but Pandya flat-batted the fourth delivery over long-on to give India a winning start to their title defence. 
Pandya said he was clear about how to accomplish the chase and knew the pressure was heavier on the bowler at that stage. 
“The [target in] last over was seven runs, but even if it was 15, I’d have fancied my chances,” Pandya, who earlier this year made a comeback into the national team after recovering from a career-threatening back injury, said. “I know it’s [a matter of’ one six, and I feel the bowler is much more under pressure bowling to me in 20th over.” 
Pandya’s brilliance with bat and ball was lauded by his skipper Rohit Sharma as India, who lost their previous match with Pakistan by 10 wickets in last year’s T20 World Cup at the same venue, improved their win-loss record to 8-2 against the arch-rivals. 
“Since the time he has made his comeback, he’s been brilliant,” Rohit said of the champion all-rounder, who led IPL debutants Gujarat Titans to the title in May. 
“He is a lot calmer now and more confident about what he wants to do, whether it’s with the bat or with the ball. He can bowl really quick, we saw that today with those short balls. 
“It was always about just understanding his game and he’s doing that well now. In a high-pressure chase with 10 runs per over needed, you can panic, but he never showed any of that.”

7,Bangladesh look to open Asia Cup campaign with win against Afghanistan,Bangladesh will be playing their tournament opener against Afghanistan today.,"SHARJAH: Bangladesh will be aiming to improve their ordinary T20 record against a confident Afghanistan side in the Asia Cup here on Tuesday.
Afghanistan pacers and batsmen alike blew away the Sri Lankan batting in the opening game.
Bangladesh, on the other hand, will be playing their tournament opener. The Shakib Al Hasan-led side will be aiming to improve their recent record in the shortest format, having won just two games out of 13 since the World Cup last year.Afghanistan pacers Fazalhaq Farooqi and Naveen-ul-Haq had broken the backbone of Sri Lanka batting and their batters had chased down the 105-run target in 10.1 overs.
Speaking ahead of the game, Bang­la­desh all-rounder Mehidy Hasan said his team would like to respond to Dasun Shanaka’s claim on the field. Shanaka rated Afgha­nistan higher than Bangladesh.
“I don’t want to make a comment that this team is good and this team is bad. I think good and bad are proved in the field. A good team can lose if they play badly on that specific day and similarly a bad team can win if they play a good game of cricket,” he said.
“We will meet in the field and at that end of the day the good team will win the match and what I feel is that we have to prove it in the field because if we play well certainly everyone will know who is a good team and who is a bad team so instead of predicting before I think it is important to play well on the field,” said Hasan.
“Look the first match is very important for any tournament because it will dictate how far we will go and what cricket we are going to play because it will set the tone of the team,” he said. 
He said the first game against Afghanistan holds a lot of impor­tance.
“If it is a spinning wicket it will be good considering both teams have quality spinners but what I feel that is the side that will perform well with the bat will have a better chance to win the game,” Hasan added.

Birmingham Phoenix anno­unced that hard-hitting batsman and spin bowler Living­stone, the top run scorer and most valuable player in last year’s inaugural edition, will miss their final two group games of the season plus any knockout ties.
The 29-year-old said on Twitter:  “Gutted to have been ruled out of @thehundred... a tournament I have loved playing in! I’ll be doing everything I can to be back out there ASAP!”
The extent of his injury is still unclear, but there are now just three-and-a-half weeks before England begin a T20 series against Pakistan in Karachi.
England white-ball captain Jos Buttler is unlikely to feature in all seven fixtures because he has a calf injury which led to him to withdraw from the Hundred.
England opening batsman Jason Roy withdrew from Oval Invincibles’ win over London Spirit on Saturday with back spasm.
Fast bowlers Chris Jordan and Tymal Mills have recently suffered finger and toe problems, respectively, while their fellow quicks Jofra Archer, Mark Wood, Chris Woakes and Saqib Mahmood are long-term absentees through injury.

The Mohammad Nabi-led side crus­hed Sri Lanka in the opener of the Asia Cup T20 tournament and next take on Bangladesh in Sharjah on Tuesday.
Rashid remains the brightest star in a galaxy of talented players many of whom have seen dark days in the war-torn nation, which witnessed another takeover by the Taliban last year.
Despite the odds, the one-time minnows have made their presence felt among the cricketing elite since making their Test debut in 2018 in India.
The 23-year-old Rashid, who has been key to the team’s fairytale rise, alongside Nabi and former captain Asghar Afghan, said they still need more space in the cricketing calender with top teams. 
“We haven’t played much international cricket, especially the longer format. It’s just about the FTP (future tours programme), it’s not in the hand of the players,” Rashid told reporters on the eve of their second Asia Cup match. 
“We want to play a lot of international cricket, that gives opportunities as youngsters come up through that. They should get the kind of environment where they can promote their cricket and skills.” 
Afghanistan are scheduled to play 53 ODIs, 71 T20Is and 22 Tests between April 2022 and May 2027 but most of them against lower ranked teams like Ireland and Zimbabwe.
Rashid, a champion leg-spinner who plies his trade in various short-format leagues including the IPL and the Hundred, has raced to 112 wickets in 67 T20 internationals. 
“Playing all the international leagues is something which gives us the kind of opportunity where we can learn from the best players,” said Rashid. “That is where we learn and we bring that experience to the national level and share that with the team. The more players go around the world and play in the leagues, I think that is what helps us, especially in the batting department.” Always known as giantkillers, Afghanistan’s stock has risen considerably at the Asia Cup after they hammered Sri Lanka by eight wickets on Saturday when they skittled their opponents for a meagre 105 and then knocked off the runs in just 10.1 overs. 
“We have prepared well and we played a good game against Sri Lanka but that’s gone,” Rashid said. 
“We think about taking one game at a time and give 100 per cent. It doesn’t matter if the other team takes us lightly or not, we work hard and practice well. 
“For us, every opposition is the toughest opposition. Tomorrow, if we play Hong Kong, we will have the same preparation as when we play India.”

Lewandowski scored twice for the second game in a row as Jules Kounde made his debut in Barcelona’s 4-0 cruise past Valladolid.
Later, Real Madrid struggled for 88 minutes at Espanyol. With the scores tied and time running out, Benzema put Real ahead before sealing a 3-1 victory after 10 eventful added minutes.
Real saved their perfect start to the season and climbed back to the top of the table on nine points after three games, ahead of Real Betis on goal difference.
Barcelona rose to third, two points further back.
“To have Lewandowski in your team is a blessing,” said Barca coach Xavi Hernandez. “He’s an extraordinary player. Spectacular. A natural leader. It’s a blessing to have him with us, it’s marvellous.
“He’s a model, a born worker. He’s humble, he works for the team, he helps the coaching staff, he makes the difference.”
At the Camp Nou, Xavi handed Kounde his first start after the club was finally able to register the France defender they signed from Sevilla last month for a reported 50 million euros.
Lewandowski hit the post with an early header. 
Pedri then spotted the run of Raphinha in behind but the Brazilian was thwarted by goalkeeper Jordi Masip, who was well beaten moments later when Ousmane Dembele’s venomous shot clipped the crossbar.
Barca’s pressure told after 24 minutes as Raphinha whipped in a teasing cross which a gambling Lewandowski stabbed home.
A marauding Dembele tested Masip from range, and then created the second for Pedri by rolling a perfectly weighted ball for the midfielder to bury on the stroke of half time.
Lewandowski all but put the game beyond reach on 64 minutes, running onto a pass from Dembele and cleverly backheeling past Masip with the help of a deflection off Joaquin Fernandez.
Valladolid nearly pulled one back but Marc-Andre ter Stegen saved well from Oscar Plano and Kounde stuck out a leg on the line to keep out the follow-up effort from Roque Mesa.
Barca grabbed a fourth in stoppage time as Roberto volleyed home after Lewandowski was denied a hat-trick after Masip, a former Barcelona player, tipped his shot onto the bar.
In the late game, Vinicius Junior ran on to a sharp diagonal pass in the 12th minute to slide the ball into the far corner and give Real Madrid the lead.
Espanyol fought back. Joselu levelled after 43 minutes. He burst through and when Thibaut Courtois saved his first thump at goal and the ball bounced off Eder Militao, the Espanyol striker beat both Real players to the ball and scuffed it in.
Both teams had chances in the second half before Benzema, as so often in the last year, decided the game. After a quiet game, he found space at the far post with two minutes left, met Rodrygo’s cross and volleyed home from cose range.
Deep into frantic added time, Espanyol goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte, charged out of his box to stop a Real attack and received a red card for a foul on Dani Ceballos.
Benzema fired home the free-kick.
“We were quite slow,” said Real coach Carlo Ancelotti.  “We had difficulty managing the intensity of the match.”

Fiorentina winger Riccardo Sottil’s long-range effort in the 24th minute was saved by Napoli keeper Alex Meret, and Giacomo Bonaventura followed up by striking just wide of the post after pouncing on a poor defensive clearance. 
Napoli striker Victor Osimhen found the net in the 43rd minute but his effort was immediately ruled out for offside. 
Napoli forward Giacomo Raspadori was twice denied by keeper Pierluigi Gollini, who kept out a powerful effort in the 74th minute from inside the box and a long-range strike eight minutes later. 
Napoli top the Serie A table as one of six teams with seven points from three games while Fiorentina, who are also unbeaten, sit ninth on five points. 
Atalanta beat Verona 1-0 away earlier on Sunday and are also on seven points. 
The hosts dominated the first half, but a left-foot shot from midfielder Teun Koopmeiners turned match in Atalanta’s favour in the 50th minute and sealed the victory.  
Salernitana sit a point behind Fiorentina in 10th after they hammered Sampdoria 4-0 thanks in large part to Boulaye Dia, who opened the scoring in the seventh minute and set up two more on his full debut for the club.

Jesper Lindstrom made it 3-2 to Eintracht towards the end of a breathless first half after he collected Sebastian Rode’s pass in behind Werder’s defence and chipped Pavlenka. 
Djibril Sow drilled in a shot after 48 minutes to put Frankfurt 4-2 up and on track for their first victory of the campaign, before Bremen’s Niclas Fuellkrug converted a penalty in second-half injury time. 
The defeat was Bremen’s first since being promoted back to the Bundesliga this season.  
Earlier in the day, FC Cologne were held to a goalless draw by 10-man VfB Stuttgart after Luca Pfeiffer was shown a straight red on his first start for the club for a reckless challenge on Timo Hubers in the second half. 
The result was the third draw for each side in four matches this season.

The Premier League giants have agreed to pay 80.75 million, with a further 4.25 million in add-ons, the BBC, Sky Sports and other British media said ahead of the transfer window closing on Thursday.
The 22-year-old Antony could be the second player to follow United manager Erik ten Hag from the Dutch champions to Old Trafford following the arrival of defender Lisandro Martinez.
Tyrell Malacia, Martinez, Christian Eriksen and Casemiro have arrived so far this summer and Ten Hag is hoping to keep Cristiano Ronaldo, despite the Portuguese wanting to leave to play Champions League football.
The 37-year-old was on the bench for United’s 1-0 win at Southampton on Saturday before making a largely anonymous substitute appearance in the second half.
United remain adamant that the five-time Ballon d’Or winner is not for sale in the second season of his second spell with the club.
“We played with him, so we want him to stay. That is what we want. I hope so,” Ten Hag said.
