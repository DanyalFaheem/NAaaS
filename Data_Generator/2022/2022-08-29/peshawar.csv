At a meeting held in Jamrud on Sunday, the FQJ leaders argued that the apex court had promised forming a larger bench before last Ramazan for hearing a case, challenging the erstwhile Fata’s merger into KP, as according to them, it was carried out without fulfilling constitutional obligations.
Speaking on the occasion, FQJ leader Haji Bismillah Khan said that the people of tribal areas expected the SC to declare the merger null and void. He said four months had gone, but the promise to form a larger SC bench to hear the pleas was yet to be fulfilled, causing unrest among a majority of tribesmen opposed to the merger.
The elder cautioned that the FQJ won’t accept the KP government’s ‘unconstitutional’ measures to ‘take control’ of the natural resources of tribal areas. 
He alleged that non-tribal people were employed in the merged districts depriving the talented local educated youth of jobs in government departments.

Meanwhile, Young Doctors Association (YDA) has expressed concerns over the surge in water and food-borne ailments and called for continuous efforts to prevent outbreaks of the diseases.
YDA’s Dr Ahmadzeb said that they organised several camps in Charsadda and Nowshera during the past two days. “Diarrhoea, skin disease and chest infections among children are common in the flood-hit areas. There is an urgent need of anti-biotic and drugs to treat skin sicknesses,” he said.
Rains have stopped but the people in both districts are still surrounded by standing water, making them more vulnerable to mosquitoes’ bites that can cause malaria and dengue fever.
Dr Ahmadzeb said that they had deployed 50 doctors, including paediatricians, physicians, orthopaedic surgeons, dermatologists and gynaecologists to examine the neediest patients. However, he said that they were facing problem of shortage of medicines. “We are collecting donations from our members but the need is too high,” he added.

However, according to residents the tehsil municipal administration is yet to swing into action to control stray dogs. 
Talking to this correspondent, the people said that dog bite cases were being reported frequently from Haripur city, Darwesh, Kangra Colony, Khalabat Township, Sera-i-Saleh and Afghan camps and children and elderly people were the worst affected by the dog attacks. 
A teenage girl died in Kahka village after she was attacked and seriously injured by a dog the other day. 
Official sources at the Haripur Trauma Centre said that from January to August the emergency facility of the district headquarters hospital had received about 2,000 dog bite cases while the number of cases reported in the basic health units and other peripheral health facilitiesof the district were not yet known. 

Official says govt hospitals have enough stocks of anti-rabies vaccine

The sources said that on average the Trauma Centre had been receiving over 200 dog bite cases a month. They said that all those dog bite patients brought to the government health facilities without wasting time had recovered after getting proper treatment. 
When contacted, Trauma Centre’s deputy medical superintendentDr Tahir Iqbal confirmed that during the last eight months over 2,000 cases of dog bite were reported. He said the population of stray dogs had increased manifold in Haripur. 
Answering a question, he said a victim needed to be administered the first dose of anti-rabiesvaccine (ARV) within 72 hours of dog bite and the second dose three days after it, while each of rest of three doses should be administered after every seven days. 
He said the dog bite victims must approach the government facilities instead of quacks, as all the government hospitals had enough stocks of anti-rabies vaccine. 
Waheed Khan, a resident of Khalabat Township, lamented that there used to be a “kuta mar mohim” (drive to cull stray dogs) at the municipal administration level in the past, but due lack of action stray dogs could now be seen roaming in every street of the city.

SWAT: The recent catastrophic floods wreaked havoc across the Swat district, but for the residents of Drab Shahgram village it was a second disaster befalling them just in the span of 12 years as the July 2010 floods had also washed away their houses, crops and orchards. 
On August 25, when unprecedented rains and floods hit Swat, the memory of the tragic 2020 deluge quickly struck the residents of Drab Shahgram village. 
“We were not expecting that once again another flood of phenomenal magnitude will strike them more severely than the previous one. We had not yet completely recovered from the previous catastrophe as we hardly managed to reconstruct our houses and restore some of the agricultural lands. But on August 25, flash floods again inundated our properties, lands and orchards,” said Bakht Jehan, an elder of the village, while sitting with other villagers in the central mosque as the floods have taken away their houses once again. 
Bakth Jehan said that about 20 houses were washed away in the village, while few more were submerged by the floodwater. “Luckily, we shifted our family members to safe places when we realised about the coming floods. Our men are staying in the mosque while we have sent our women to stay with our relatives,” he said, adding that they were unable to withstand such catastrophes in future. 
He said that the villagers had no lands except the one near the river and they would reconstruct their houses because they could not live under open sky for long. 
“We lost all of our stock of food as well as standing crops and orchards. Our relatives and the people in the neighbouring villages are arranging food for us,” said Ajmal Shah, another resident of the village. 
He said that so far, a few local social organisations had approached them and collected data of the damage, but no government agency reached them. “We are in need of both food and non-food items, and appeal to the government agencies to provide us with these items immediately so that the homeless people could survive,” said Ajmal Shah. 
Drab Shahgram village, which is located near the famous Madyan valley in Bahrain tehsil, is known for its agricultural produce, including vegetables, grains and fruits, but the devastating floods have almost washed away the entire agricultural land. Majority of the families are dependent upon their agricultural produce for subsistence.

10,PHC rejects bail plea of ‘mentally ill’ man in double murder case,Upholds trial court order of referring him to psychiatric facility...,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has turned down bail plea of an accused suffering from mental ailment in a double-murder case and upheld order of the trial court to refer him to a psychiatric facility for treatment.
A single-member bench of PHC Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan ruled that the trial court had rightly ordered to refer the petitioner, Akhtar Zaman, to the psychiatric ward of Police and Services Hospital and in the meanwhile adjourned the trial proceedings sine die.
The court observed that the trial proceedings could be revived as and when the petitioner was declared fit by the standing medical board after his recovery from the ailment.
The petitioner along with his two absconding brothers Afsar Zaman and Khurshid Zaman was charged for the murder of Roaidad Gul and his son Rab Nawaz in thelimits of Urmer police station in Peshawar on July 15, 2016.

Upholds trial court order of referring him to psychiatric facility

Following the occurrence the petitioner had been absconding and was arrested on February 20, 2021. Earlier, his bail petition was rejected on merit by the high court on April 23, 2021. After the trial commenced, the petitioner raised the plea of unsound mind and filed an application for constitution of a medical board.
He was examined by a medical board and a report was submitted by it on September 14, 2021, wherein it was mentioned that he had no major mental illness and that he was mentally sound and could face trial in court of law.
The petitioner again raised the issue on October 25, 2021. He was again referred to a standing medical board by the trial court.
The medical board in its report on April 7, 2022 ruled that the petitioner was suffering from bipolar affective disorder, which was a major mental illness with episodes of severe mood disturbance where the patient was of unsound mind during such episodes.
The board stated that it was likely that the patient with bipolar affective disorder acted without knowing the consequences of his/her act during the episode of mood disturbance. However, the board added that it could not be confirmed from the FIR, treatment record and behaviour of the accused that he was of sound mind or otherwise at the time of committing the crime.
On the basis of the said report, the petitioner filed bail plea before the trial court, which was rejected on June 20, 2022. On the same date, the trial court adjourned the trial sine die till his recovery from mental illness and referred him to the custody of the mental ward of Police and Services Hospital Peshawar for treatment.
The petitioner’s counsel contended before the high court when his client was admittedly a patient of bipolar affective disorder disease, then he was entitled to the released on bail as required under section 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
An additional advocate general, Mujahid Ali Khan, opposed his plea, stating that the accused was a dangerous and hardened criminal and was also charged in 14 other criminal cases of identical nature.
The bench observed that neither any plea of the alleged mental sickness was agitated by the accused in the first round of his bail petition, nor any medical history in that regard was brought before any forum.
The bench observed that keeping in view the conflicting opinions of the two standing medical boards and also his previous criminal history of his involvement in several other FIRs, the petitioner could not press into service section 466 of the CrPC for his release on bail.

Meanwhile, QWP provincial vice-chairperson Dr Faiza Rasheed told a press conference in Haripur on Sunday that the powers had been transferred to the provinces under the 18th Amendment, but the incompetent rulers of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf were unable to benefit from the provincial autonomy and run the affairs of government accordingly. She said this was evident from the provincial government’s dealing with the flood calamity. 
Dr Faiza said that thousands of people had been displaced in Kohistan, Kaghan, Naran, Swat and DI Khan areas, but the PTI government was busy in promoting a specific ideology that had destroyed the culture of morality and respect in the Pakistani society.

Sources told Dawn that the new CDA chairman retired Capt Mohammad Usman had prioritised the project and after a meeting at Prime Minister Office on Friday he also inspected the project site.
The sources said a topographic survey of the project was in progress which will be completed in a few days after which the engineering design of the bypass will be completed before finalising PC-I.
“Since the prime minister is directly monitoring and the chairman is fully focusing on the project, hopefully, all the prerequisite formalities will be completed in a week or so. We have already engaged Frontier Work Organisation (FWO) and it is expected that the formal construction work would be started during the second week of September,” said an official of the CDA.

The prime minister has fixed a four-month deadline for completion of the project. “Once started, this project could be completed within four months,” the official said.
As per preliminary working of the CDA, the bypass would be five kilometres, including one km elevated road (flyover), with two interchanges at the starting and near the ending point.
It will start from Murree Road near Quaid-i-Azam University stop and after passing through Kayani Road and Bhara Kahu’s Friday bazaar will again touch Murree Road near the Jugi stop. 
From there, it will have a one-km flyover which will culminate at the end of Bhara Kahu.
CDA officials said that the cost of the project will be finalised while preparing PC-I, adding tentatively the worth of the project will be over five billion rupees. They said the CDA was also checking if construction of one-km flyover could be avoided and instead of the flyover the existing roads could be expanded. However, the officials said apparently there was no capacity in the existing roads for expansion and the CDA will have to go for a flyover.
“We have made our mind; the five-km project will have four-km road and one km flyover. But, yes, we are also checking the option of expansion of the roads but ultimately we will have to go for the flyover,” an official of the civic agency said.
The prime minster earlier this month had stated that completing the Bhara Kahu bypass within four months was possible, adding his team had in the past completed major projects in Punjab in less than four months.
Former prime minister Imran Khan in April last year had laid the foundation of the bypass to provide an alternative route to those travelling towards Murree, Galyat and Kashmir. However, the project, which was 7.8km from Murree Road to Satra Meel, could not be started during the tenure of his government.
Now the CDA has shelved that project and instead of the 7.8km bypass it is going to construct a four-km road with one-km flyover, which according to the engineering wing, is cost-effective and doable in the shortest time.
The officials said that the earlier designed 7.8km project required more than two years for completion because of lot of cut and fill was involved in it as it.
“Therefore, we have shelved that project and are now working on the road-cum-flyover project,” said an engineer of the CDA. He said that alighment of 7.8km road project had already been finalised which would be used in future.
