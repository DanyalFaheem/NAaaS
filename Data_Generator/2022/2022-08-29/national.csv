0,Courts can’t excuse delay in suit filing  after expiry period,SC sets aside Balochistan High Court ruling in lease case.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has ruled that courts have no authority in condoning delay in the filing of a lawsuit if barred by time due to expiry of the period, though concession of time can be granted by the courts if strong reasons are made out such as disability or insanity.
The language used in Section 3 of the Limitation Act is mandatory in nature and imposes a duty upon the courts to dismiss the lawsuit or a complaint instituted after the expiry of period provided, unless the plaintiff seeks exclusion of time by pleading grounds provided in section 4 to 25 of the act such as disability, insanity etc, said Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in a judgment he wrote.
“It is to be kept in mind that upon expiry of the limitation period, a claimant loses his right to enforce his claim through the court of law and consequently a right accrues in favour of the other party, which cannot be lightly disturbed or brushed aside unless sufficient cause is show and accepted by the court,” Justice Shah explained in the verdict.
Justice Shah, who retired as the Supreme Court judge on Aug 14, was a member of a three-judge bench also comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah that had taken up an appeal against the Balochistan High Court (BHC) ruling that allowed fresh filing of the case for trial on merits after setting aside the concurrent findings of the courts below on the point of limitation.

SC sets aside BHC ruling in lease case

The case at hand involves filing of a suit on April 23, 2001 against petitioners Muhammad Anwar — now deceased — and Abdul Hameed, seeking cancellation of their lease and mutation etc on some properties. In the lawsuit the cause of action accrued in 1971-72 and thereafter on different dates of July 2000 etc. But the suit was dismissed on June 25, 2001 by holding it to be barred by time though the BHC on March 28, 2002 allowed withdrawal of the suit for filing it afresh.
The judgement recalled how respondents in the present case with name of Essa on June 18, 2002 filed a suit wherein the case of action was asserted to have arisen in July 2000 instead of 1971-72 as argued in the first plaint. The plaint however was returned in October 25, 2005 for the want of jurisdiction. The respondents instead of presenting the same plaint to the court of competent jurisdiction filed a fresh suit on April 27, 2006 in the court from which these proceedings had emanated. Again the court of first instance on Sept 18, 2007 dismissed the suit being barred by time. The respondents instead of filing the appeal before the district judge approached the BHC which on Sept 15, 2011 returned the appeal to the respondents to present it before the district judge, which also dismissed the same on Dec 30, 2013.
The respondents thereafter invoked the revisional jurisdiction of the high court, which dealt with the issue of limitation, according to the judgment, in a very casual and callous manner by holding that the limitation act empowers the court to enhance the period of limitation and remanded the case to the trial court with directions to decide it on merits.
Justice Shah regretted that the high court had failed to consider and appreciate that the parameters of discretion in condoning the delay in filing an application, appeal, review or revision etc were totally different than the powers vested in court to condone the delay occasioned in filing the suit.
The courts on the original side while trying a suit is required under Section 3 of the act to dismiss the suit if it is found to be barred by time notwithstanding that the limitation has not been set up as defence.
The court even has no discretion or power to condone the delay in the filing of suit on the humanitarian grounds or by invoking the principles of equity unless any of the grounds prescribed in the act was available to the plaintiff and is duly pleaded, Justice Shah observed also citing 1997 Indian Supreme Court judgment in P.K. Ramchandran case in which it was held that the law of limitation may harshly effect a particular party but it has to be applied with all its rigour when the statute so prescribes and the courts have no power to extend the period of limitation on equitable grounds.
The Supreme Court, however, set aside the BHC order and maintained the concurrent orders of the trial courts.

1,Imran to raise funds for flood victims today,Says a committee headed by PTI leader Dr Sania Nishtar will deal with all the matters related to donations.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan will participate in an international telethon today to collect funds for the victims of massive floods which have claimed almost 1,000 lives and have left over 30 million without shelter across Pakistan.
In a video message on Sunday, the former prime minister said Pakistanis were suffering due to floods across the country that have affected a large number of people.
“I will hold a telethon at 9:30 pm today to collect funds for the flood victims from people within Pakistan and overseas Pakistanis. I want every Pakistani to contribute to the fund and donate as much as possible,” he said. Imran Khan said that a committee headed by PTI leader Dr Sania Nishtar will deal with all the matters related to donations and added that the body will have representation from all provinces. He said that the funds will be spent and distributed among those affected by floods.

It is worth mentioning that the PTI chief on Saturday announced to organise an international telethon for the flood victims.
“Our senior leadership met & we decided I would do international telethon to raise funds for flood affectees on Monday night. Imran Tigers will be activated to volunteer for relief work. A committee under Sania Nishtar will be set up to identify & coordinate funds allocation based on needs,” he had tweeted.
His change of heart came a day after he had expressed reluctance to participate in the fundraising campaign for the victims of the calamity. The former premier during a visit to Dera Ismail Khan had said he will not raise funds until he has a clear picture of whether the money will be spent fairly or not. 
The former premier also faced criticism for “playing politics” over the issue of floods as Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal urged people to shun “such pessimism”. “Today, Imran [Khan] said that massive damage occurred because we did not build efficient infrastructure — this is a false statement… it is irresponsible and it should not happen,” the minister said on Saturday.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, the PPP chief and foreign minister, had also called out the PTI chairman for his decision to go ahead with political gatherings in spite of massive floods in Pakistan. “It’s unfortunate the politicking is taking place despite the devastation of this magnitude caused by the rains.

3,"Affected population may rise above 33m, Sherry fears","Says as many as 1,033 people have lost their lives and more than 1,500 are injured.","ISLAMABAD: The government on Sunday warned that the number of population affected by floods may rise from 33 million as the length and breadth of the country continued to reel from the destruction caused by torrential rains and deluge.
Federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman said the government, supported by the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies, is leading the humanitarian action.
Talking about the destruction, she said that as many as 1,033 people have lost their lives and more than 1,500 are injured.
“Kabul River is still at ‘very high flood level’ at Nowshera as more than 300,000 cusecs of water was crossing the river,” she said, adding that with 500,000 cusecs, water levels in River Indus at Taunsa, Sukkur and Chashma are at ‘high flood level’.
Calling the catastrophe ‘a perfect storm’, the minister added that as relentless rains battered the southern parts of the country, the floods in the Indus river ravaged the northern areas, Ms Rehman said.
Compensation for victims
The minister said that the economic affairs division and other ministries were working around the clock with about 35 multilateral and bilateral donors to assess needs and bridge gaps in relief efforts.
“Benazir Income Support Program had started rolling out Rs25,000 [for each affected family]. The relief tranches amount to Rs35 billion for the most vulnerable.”
Ms Rehman said the government is providing Rs1 million compensation to the next of kin who died and Rs 250,000 to the injured.
Rs 500,000 is being provided for fully destroyed houses and Rs 250,000 for partially destroyed houses, she added.
Briefing on the relief efforts, she said, as the rain has abated in some areas, the National Disaster Management Authority and Pakistan Army have amped up rescue efforts.

4,Flooded Sindh awaits another deluge from north,"Torrents from swollen tributaries in the mountainous north are coursing down the Indus, due to arrive in coming days.","SUKKUR: Already flooded Sindh province braced on Sunday for a fresh deluge from swollen rivers in the north as the death toll from monsoon topped 1,000.
Officials warned torrents of wat­er are expected to reach Sindh in the next few days, adding misery to millions already affected by the floods.
Sindh has been pounded by weeks of torrential rain that have flooded farmlands across the province, but now torrents from swollen tributaries in the mountainous north are coursing down the Indus, due to arrive in coming days.
As the deluge makes its way to the province, the fate of hundreds of thousands of people in Sindh lies with a 90-year-old barrage that directs the flow of water from the Indus River into one of the world’s largest irrigation systems.
“Right now, Indus is in high flood,” said Aziz Soomro, the supervisor of Sukkur Barrage. “That wa­ter coming into the river is scaring us,” Irshad Ali, a 42-year-old farmer near the city of Sukkur, told AFP as he lamented the date palms and vegetable patches he lost to the monsoon.

People pin hopes on Sukkur Barrage to redirect water; 119 killed in 24 hours as death toll reaches 1,033

Water from the Indus is already lapping over its banks in several places, and unless the Sukkur Barrage can control the flow, catastrophe will result.
Originally known as Lloyd Barrage, it was considered an engineering marvel when completed in 1932, capable of discharging 1.4 million cubic metres of water per second through 19 steel gates hinged between stone pillars.
“It has completed 90 years, whereas it had a 50-year guarantee,” Minister for Water Resou­rces Khursheed Shah told AFP.
“So we are 40 years beyond its guaranteed life.”
Water is redirected by the barrage to a series of canals totalling nearly 10,000 kilometres that thread through farmlands, but years of neglect mean they are not capable of dealing with today’s record volumes.
“Silt has been piling up and it is not being removed,” said Shah, adding a lack of equipment meant the canals hadn’t been dredged since 2010.
“The city is already four feet below the river levels,” minister Shah said.
In parts of Sindh, the only dry areas are the elevated roads and  rai­l­road tracks, alongside which tens of thousands of poor rural folk  have taken shelter with their livestock.
Near Sukkur, a row of  tents stretched for two kilometres, with people still arriving by boats  loaded with wooden charpoy beds and pots and pans — the only  possessions they could salvage.
“Water started rising in the river  from yesterday, inundating all the villages and forcing us to flee,”  labourer Wakeel Ahmed said.
The barrage supervisor  said every sluice gate was open to deal with a river flow of  more than 600,000 cubic metres per second.
The flooding could not  come at a worse time for Pakistan, where the economy is in free fall and  the former prime minister Imran Khan was ousted by a parliamentary vote  of no confidence in April.
“This embankment is strong, mac­hinery is available and the staff on alert,” said overseer Shahid Hussain.
Officials say this year’s monsoon flooding has affected more than 33 million people — one in seven Pakistanis — destroying or badly damaging nearly a million homes. The government has decl­ared an emergency to deal with floods.
While the capital Islamabad and adjoining garrison city of Rawal­pindi have escaped the worst of the flooding, its effects were still being felt. “Tomatoes, peas, onions and other vegetables are not available due to the floods,” he told AFP, adding prices were also soaring.
Engineers were scrambling  on Sunday to reinforce Ali Wahan levee, a crucial curve of the Indus River in the city that is threatened by the swollen river.
“The good thing is the timing,” he added, explaining that flooding caused by local rain should have receded by the time the water from the north courses through.
But if it does rain again closer to home, the situation could change quickly.
On Sunday, the National Disaster Management Authority said the death toll from the monsoon rains had reached 1,033, with 119 killed in the previous 24 hours.
It said this year’s floods were comparable to 2010 —the worst on record —when over 2,000 people died and nearly a fifth of the country was under water.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he had never seen anything like it before.
“Village after village has been wiped out. Millions of houses have been destroyed. There has been immense destruction,” he said after flying over Sindh by helicopter.
Thousands of people living near flood-swollen rivers in the north were also ordered to evacuate from danger zones, but army helicopters and rescuers are still plucking laggards to safety.
Officials blame the devastation on human-driven climate change, saying Pakistan is unfairly bearing the consequences of irresponsible environmental practices elsewhere in the world.
Pakistan is eighth on NGO Germ­an­­watch’s Global Climate Risk Index, a list of countries deemed most vulnerable to extreme weather caused by climate change.
Exacerbating the situation, corruption, poor planning and the flouting of local regulations mean thousands of buildings have been erected in areas prone to seasonal flooding.

5,Farmers seek  help for huge losses to crops,Farmers Associates Pakistan director says all crops have been badly damaged due to inclement weather.,"LAHORE: In the wake of the massive damage caused to crops by the monsoon rains and floods, different organisations have urged the government to extend financial help to affected farmers to enable them to sow the next crop.
Farmers Associates Pakistan (FAP) Director Farooq Bajwa says that the record-breaking rains have caused 30 per cent losses to the agriculture sector as compared to the previous year’s output.
He says that all crops, including maize, fodder and cotton, have been badly damaged due to inclement weather, adding that small farmers are in a very precarious condition due to massive damage to their standing crops and they are unable to sow new crops unless they are given financial help or seed and other farm inputs.
Aamer Hayat Bhandara, co-founder of the Agriculture Republic, a think-tank, says that rains hit the growers at a time when Kharif crops were at the flowering stage.
He says the paddy crop was at the pollination stage when it was hit by heavy rains and it is likely to have lower yield. Similarly, he says, cotton and date palm growers have also been hit by the weather.
He says that small and medium-scale farmers are usually dependent on commission agents (arhtis) and in the absence of crop insurance most of them have to rely on loans given by arhtis for a longer term.
Pakistan Businesses Forum (PBF) vice-president Jahan Ara Watoo says that flooding, coupled with an expected hike in prices of raw materials, has set off alarm bells in the agriculture sector.
The floods have caused a humanitarian disaster of epic proportions as the ongoing monsoon has doomed the farmers, particularly women growers, she says.
Ms Watoo notes the exact losses of livestock are yet to be determined as most of the people have been evacuated to safer places, but a majority of the cattle have been washed away by floodwaters.
She says that rice and cotton growing areas of Sindh and south Punjab are the worst affected, while mango orchards and red chilies farms in province have also been inundated.

7,Journalist booked for linking remarks about Islam to Imran,RAWALPINDI: The police have registered a case against a known journalist on allegations of attributing...,"RAWALPINDI: The police have registered a case against a known journalist on allegations of attributing “disrespectful” statements “not based on facts” about Islam to PTI chairperson Imran Khan.
Chaudhry Nasir Qayyum, a cable operator, said in the FIR registered with the RA Bazar police under Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religious beliefs) and Section 500 (punishment for defamation) of Pakistan Penal Code.
The complainant said he was watching social media in his office on Aug 24, when he saw a video in which one man explained why he “hates” Imran Khan and reasons of him going against the former prime minister.
The FIR mentioned statements which, according to the complainant, “disrespected” Islam, according to a Dawn.com report. 
The complainant said that journalist Waqar Satti attributed these statements to Imran Khan. He added that he had never heard any Muslim making such remarks and “linking these words and remarks to former prime minister Imran Khan is not based on facts”.
Imran Khan did not mention any such words […] mentioned by the journalist in his tweet — in any of his speeches, the FIR quoted him as saying.
In the FIR, he said the journalist’s action has hurt his religious sentiments as well as thousands of other Muslims.
The complainant alleged that the journalist had done injustice, and sought legal action against him on the basis of these accusations.
When contacted, Mr Satti said that whatever he had posted on social media was based on Imran Khan’s reported statements. However, he said,  despite this, he had already deleted the controversial post.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari condemned the Punjab government for registering the case against the journalist.
In a statement, he said an example of filing cases against journalists due to fear of criticism is not found in any civilised society.
Putting the safety of the journalist’s life at stake just to prevent criticism is not the tradition of a democratic society, he said.
The PPP leader called upon the Punjab government to withdraw the baseless case against the journalist.

8,"Literary Notes: Urdu doha, its Hindi tradition and Khan-i-Khanan","ASIDE from his military and political feats, Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan (1556-1627) is renowned as a poet and ...","


 
ASIDE from his military and political feats, Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan (1556-1627) is renowned as a poet and credited with writing some of the finest dohas in history of Urdu poetry.
Doha, also known as dohra is the briefest genre and usually consists of only two lines, as the name suggests, though in Hindi some long poems have also been composed in this prosodic pattern. Doha is an independent and free-standing genre, completely conveying the theme. It has two pithy lines that rhyme and often offer metaphysical and wise ideas, hence making it popular among Muslim Sufis and Hindu saints.
The genre has been popular in Hindi, Braj Bhasha, Avadhi and Urdu and is still composed in Sindhi and Saraeki. Though Doha cannot be traced in Sanskrit literature, some poets wrote dohas in Prakrits and Apabhranshas, the languages spoken in North India before the development of dialects, such as Khari Boli and Braj Bhasha, that later on further developed into modern languages.
According to Jamal Panipati, the earliest samples of doha can be found in Bu Ali Shah Qalandar’s and Ameer Khusrau’s poetry. But the fact is there are dohas attributed to Baba Fareeduddin Ganjshakar that are found in some old religious works and are dated earlier than Ameer Khusrau. From Baba Fareed to Bahadur Shah Zafar, we find the tradition flourishing and both Hindu and Muslim poets composed dohas during this period spreading over 700 years. Some of the well-known poets of doha in this long period included Bhagat Kabir, Mirabai, Surdas, Tulsidas, Bihari Lal, Shiekh Yahya Maneri, Shams-ul-Ushshaaq Meeran Jee, Abdur Rahim Khan-e-Khanan and Malik Muhammad Jaisi.
It is a fact that Urdu doha was much impressed and inspired by Hindi doha and the behr, or metre, used for Urdu doha is called chhand, or Hindi metre. Even the vocabulary used in Urdu doha is predominantly Hindi. This is one of the reasons why a doha is usually dubbed ‘Hindi doha’, though Urdu doha has a history of its own.
Doha tradition in Urdu began to decline in latter half of 19th century. However, some theatrical companies used dohas in their stage plays and they were mostly composed by the playwrights themselves, like Agha Hashr Kashmiri. The genre would have almost died in Pakistan — despite its long history and tradition — had it not been for Khwaja Dil Muhammad, who composed dohas and published an entire collection of his Urdu dohas, titled Peet Ki Reet. Dil used the same Hindi metre for Urdu dohas that has 48 metrical units, or short vowels, often called instants and commonly known as maatras.
Another poet that lent a new lease of life to Urdu doha was Jameeluddin Aali. But, interestingly, Aali had slightly amended the metre to make it compatible with Urdu and Persian prosodic patterns. This led to a controversy, with some poets and scholars accusing Aali of deviating from the traditional doha patterns. But Farman Fatehpuri and Jamal Panipati challenged their view and accorded approval by saying that what Aali wrote was not Hindi dohas but Urdu dohas and this new metre that Aali innovated was completely in sync with Urdu and fits in well. In fact, it was Aali who made Urdu doha popular again with his melodious renderings in mushairas.
After Aali, some other poets began composing doha in Urdu and they include Jameel Azeemabadi, Partau Roheela, Ilyas Ishqi, Taj Saeed, Jamal Panipati, Tahir Saeed Haroon and Kishwer Naheed. Soon research work began on Urdu doha and students from Multan and Lahore wrote dissertations on Urdu doha in Pakistan.
It is said that Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan had composed 700 dohas in Braj Bhasha, a dialect of Urdu and/or Hindi, but only 100 could survive. Some of them have become very famous and are often quoted. Hasan Aziz Javed had written a book Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan Aur Un Ke Dohe. This writer luckily grabbed a copy from a roadside hawker of old books. A slim volume published from Karachi in 1968, it reproduced 74 dohas selected from several Hindi manuscripts preserved at British Museum.
A few of those dohas by Khan-i-Khanan are reproduced here for the readers to enjoy the language and the themes. In this doha, Rahim stresses that materialistic belongings are of no help when departing for hereafter:
Bhaar jhonk ke bhaar mein Rahiman utre paar
Wo boode manjdhaar mein jin ke sar par bhaar
[Throwing the weight (of belongings) into an oven Rahim swam across
But those with heavy burden sank in the midstream]
In another doha, Rahim says:
Kher, khoon, khaansi, khushi, bair, preet, madpaan
Rahiman daabe na daben, jaanat shakal jahan
[Virtue, murder, cough, happiness, enmity, love and intoxication
O Rahim! Hide them no matter how much, they will tell]
