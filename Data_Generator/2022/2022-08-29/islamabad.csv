0,Vegetable prices in Islamabad rise amid flood emergency,No local production as CDA’s allotted agricultural land being used for palatial houses in Islamabad.,"ISLAMABAD: Owing to the flood that wreaked havoc in various parts of the country, the prices of vegetables, particularly onions and tomatoes, have increased manifold in Islamabad.
In various markets of Islamabad, onions are being sold at Rs280 and tomatoes at Rs220 per kilogramme. Whereas, in the Sunday Bazaars, average quality onions were available at Rs230 and tomatoes at Rs170 per kg.
Shopkeepers and wholesale dealers fear that these prices will further increase in the coming days as parts of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Giligit-Baltistan had witnessed the worst floods that not only damaged life and properties of people but also crops.
“The prices of onions are constantly increasing. Right now (Sunday night) we are selling five kg onions against Rs1,300 (Rs260 per kg) here in Sabzi mandi. There is no local production because of flood and we are selling onions imported from Afghanistan,” said Hafizullah, a wholesale dealer of potatoes and onions.

He said tomato crops were also badly damaged and this resulted into the shortage of local tomatoes. “In the mandi, we have tomatoes also imported from Afghanistan,” he said.
In Sunday bazaars, all major vegetables saw an increase in prices. According to the rate list, ginger was sold at Rs356, garlic (China) at Rs288 per kg, peas Rs240 per kg, green beans Rs246, turnips at Rs110, cauliflower and cabbage at Rs126 per kg.
While in open markets, the prices of vegetables were much higher than the prices in Sunday bazaars.
“When prices are much higher in the mandi, how can we sell them at reduced rates. Frankly speaking, after selling tomatoes at Rs220 per kg, we are earning nothing special,” said a vegetable seller at Sitara Market, who wished not to be named.
A customer, Nazakat Khan, in G-6 cooperative market, while purchasing onions said: “The nation is paying the price because of negligence of the government. Why wasn’t timely action taken to mitigate the loss caused by the flood? Because of early warning system, the government was well aware that this might happen but now a large number of people have died, thousands have become homeless and crops have been damaged.”
Islamabad’s production
People of Islamabad have been deprived of local production just because of the negligence of Capital Development Authority (CDA).
The capital city has almost no local production due to negligence of the CDA as agricultural land, which is allotted for this purpose, has been used for construction of palatial houses instead. On the other hand, the city is almost fully dependent on supply from others parts of the country.
According to CDA record, there are 539 vegetable, fruit and poultry farms in the city, which are supposed to cultivate fruits and vegetables to meet the needs of residents of the city. But these farms have been turned into palatial houses by their owners.
The farms are located in various areas such as Park Road Chak Shahzad, Kahuta Road, Murree Road, Tarlai Kalan, Sehana and in H-9.
Initially in the 70s when CDA started allotting farmhouses, the allowed covered area was 2,500 sq ft. But with the passage of time, the CDA kept increasing the size and currently 9,500 sq ft covered area is legally allowed.
Sources said majority of the original allottees had already sold out the agro-farms to elite class of the country who have been paying no heed to fulfill the requirements of the residents of Islamabad by providing them fresh vegetables, fruits and poultry products. Instead of taking serious action, the CDA, it seems, has restricted itself only to issuing notices to owners of farm houses, warning them to do cultivation in accordance with terms and conditions of allotment letters.
Gujar Khan
The failure of the local authorities to ensure the implementation of official rates and highhandedness of shopkeepers is costing the residents of Gujar Khan areas dearly.
The residents of Gujar Khan, Daultala, Bewal, Jabbar and Mandra have complained about the rates of vegetables, fruits and other edible products, including pulses, milk, yogurt and meat.
Talking to Dawn, Amir Wazir Malik, a resident of Gujar Khan, said the official rate of good quality onion in Gujar Khan on Sunday was Rs210 per kg while it was being sold at Rs250-Rs320 per kg. 
Similarly, the official rate of per kg tomatoes was Rs180 while it was selling at Rs300 per kg. He said that the official prices were being violated by the shopkeepers as there was no check and balance by the authorities.
Similarly, a resident of Daultala, Mohammad Bashir, said that most of the shopkeepers were not displaying the official rate lists of fruits and vegetables issued by the market committees. He said that when he asked a shopkeeper to display the rate lists and charge accordingly, the shopkeeper refused.
Talking to Dawn, another resident of Gujar Khan said the official rate was also being violated by grocery stores and there was nobody to stop them from profiteering. 
He said that the prices of dairy products, including milk and yogurt, had also gone up. 
He said that many shopkeepers were selling adulterated milk which was affecting the health of children and senior citizens. He urged the Punjab Food Authority to take action against those selling adulterated milk. — Additional reporting by Hamid Asghar

25 shops sealed
The district administration on Sunday afternoon sealed 25 shops of clothes and shoes in Saddar in its ongoing campaign to eliminate dengue. 
Assistant Commissioner (Saddar) Aneesha Hashim checked Zarkoon Plaza on Sunday afternoon and found violation of dengue standard operating procedures (SOPs) on the rooftop of the shopping mall.
Cantonment Traders Association Secretary General Zafar Qadri told Dawn that the district administration’s action against traders was unjustified as the shops which had been sealed were located on the ground floor and it had nothing to do with the roof of the shopping plaza.
He said that in Saddar, every unit of the shopping mall is responsible for its own area, adding that the roof of the shopping mall is responsibility of the owner of the commercial building and the administration should take action against the owner instead of shop owners.
He said that the district administration and officials were trying to show performance while sealing shops without any justification.

The president reprimanded NHA for causing unnecessary delay in implementing the award announced 25 years ago, and directed it to pay the due amount to the citizens within 45 days of the announcement of the decision. Payment should be made in accordance with the compensation award announced by NHA in 1997 which remained uncontested and unimplemented since then, the president noted.
He pointed out that it was not a matter of measurement and assessment of land but implementation and payment of the awarded compensation as per the orders of NHA in 1997.
He highlighted that this aspect was not factored in by the federal ombudsman while passing the impugned orders, and held that since the award of 1997 had not been challenged by either party, therefore, it attained finality and NHA was bound to pay the assessed amount as per law.
The Wafaqi Mohtasib in its decision had declined to intervene and provide relief to the complainants, saying that the matter required site visit, measurement of land and detailed examination of both documentary and oral evidence, and its assessment in the light of Qanoon-i-Shahadat Order for which the proper forum was a court of competent jurisdiction and not the office of the Wafaqi Mohtasib.
As per details, NHA had acquired land measuring 11 kanals and 10 marlas from three citizens for the construction of N-5, the national highway from Torkham in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Karachi. But proper compensation according to NHA rules and regulations was not paid.
Feeling aggrieved, the complainants approached the Wafaqi Mohtasib in 2021 to seek proper compensation, but the Mohtasib disposed of the matter without providing any relief.
Subsequently, the complainants filed a representation with the president against the decision of the Mohtasib. The president overruled the decision and directed NHA to work out the balance compensation and pay the amount as per award within 45 days.

3,‘Pakistan is a catalyst for global economy and trade’,ISLAMABAD: Chairman of Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) Committee Islamabad (ACI) Ambassador Nguyen...,"ISLAMABAD: Chairman of Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) Committee Islamabad (ACI) Ambassador Nguyen Tien Phong on Sunday said that Asean is a symbol of shared property and economic development for the whole world including Pakistan, which is a catalyst in global economy and trade.
During an interview, he said that according to the vision of Asean, these economic relations are to further strengthen economic and trade integration in the world, from which countries including Pakistan can also get benefits.
Today, the economic volume of Asean countries has exceeded $3.3 trillion, which is likely to improve further in the near future, he said, adding that Pakistan’s trade volume with Asean countries is $11 billion, which is much less than its current potential. Mr Phong said that Asean’s economic growth could further accelerate to 5 percent in 2022.
The foundation of Asean was laid on Aug 8, 1967, he said, adding that regional integration of Asean countries was not only essential for economic prosperity of the region but also important for global economic linkages and connectivity.
He said economic and trade liberalisation, multilateralism, credibility, global connectivity, economic stability, youth empowerment, maritime security, political stability, and regional connectivity are part of Asean’s regional economic vision.
Asean has reaffirmed the belief that regionalism and multilateralism are important principles and frameworks of cooperation, and that their strength and value lie in their inclusivity, rules-based nature, and emphasis on mutual benefit and respect.
The Asean countries have shown commitment towards maintaining and promoting peace, security and stability in the region and peaceful resolution of disputes, including full respect for legal and diplomatic processes, without resorting to the threat or use of force, in accordance with the universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
The association underscored the importance of seizing opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) with the Covid-19 pandemic having accentuated the urgency for digital transformation.
He said that Pakistan was accorded the status of sectoral dialogue partner of Asean at the 26th Asean Ministerial Meeting on July, 23 1993, adding that the meeting of Asean-Pakistan Joint Sectoral Dialogue Relations was convened in November 1997 in Islamabad to launch the partnership.
During the meeting, it was agreed that Asean-Pakistan Sectoral Dialogue Partnership would initially cover cooperation in trade, industry, investment, environment, science and technology, drugs and narcotics, tourism and human resources development.
The Asean-Pakistan Sectoral Dialogue Relations was institutionalised through the convening of the First Meeting of the Asean-Pakistan Joint Sectoral Cooperation Committee (AP JSCC) in February 1999 in Bali.
Ambassador Phong said that Pakistan acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia on July 2, 2004 in Jakarta.
On the same day Pakistan was also admitted as the 24th participant of the Asean Regional Forum (ARF).
Asean and Pakistan signed the Joint Declaration for Cooperation to Combat Terrorism at the sidelines of the 12th ARF on July 29, 2005 in Vientiane.
He said that in trade, Asean and Pakistan have undertaken a Joint Feasibility Study for an Asean-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to enhance and expand the overall Asean-Pakistan economic engagement.
The ambassador was of the view that regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) in which Asean plays an important role has huge potential for Asean and Pakistan’s economic, trade, investment to reach a new high level with the shift in paradigm from geo-politics to geo-economics in Pakistan.
He said that RCEP, which came into force on Jan 1, 2022, is a free trade agreement among the Asia-Pacific nations of Australia, Brunei, Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, New Zealand, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
The 15 member countries account for about 30 percent of the world’s population (2.2 billion people) and 30pc of the global GDP ($29.7 trillion), making it the largest trade bloc in history.
RCEP includes a mix of high, middle and low-income countries. It is expected to eliminate about 90pc of the tariffs on imports between its signatories within 20 years of coming into force, and establish common rules for e-commerce, trade, and intellectual property, he said.

8,Environment samples in capital report negative for poliovirus,"ISLAMABAD: The federal capital’s both environmental samples have been found negative for the poliovirus, said...","ISLAMABAD: The federal capital’s both environmental samples have been found negative for the poliovirus, said District Health Officer (DHO) Dr Zaeem Zia through social media on Sunday.
“Polio environment sample which was positive in Sabzimandi area has now turned negative. This is all the efforts of polio frontline workers. The DEOC/NEOC and partner organisations will continue to make right decisions to keep Islamabad safer,” he tweeted.
It is worth mentioning that on August 2, contrary to the government’s claims that poliovirus had been restricted to southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts, environmental samples from seven cities returned positive. 
The virus was reported in sewage samples collected from Islamabad and Lahore after a gap of 16 months. Both the cities were declared polio-free in March 2021.
Other cities in which poliovirus was detected included Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Bannu, Nowshera and Swat.
Sewage samples were collected on a monthly basis from 58 sites across the country under the supervision of provincial health departments and tested by Regional Polio Reference Laboratory at the NIH Islamabad.
If the poliovirus is found in sewage, the sample is called ‘positive’. Samples of sewage from an area are a basic parameter to determine the success of polio campaigns. Moreover, the presence of virus in sewage also shows that the immunity level of children in the area has fallen and they are at the risk of catching the disease.
Dr Zia, while talking to Dawn, said that it was a great news that environment samples collected from two places of the federal capital were found negative.
“It shows that the residents [who can become carrier of the virus], especially children, have been saved from the crippling disease. 
We are very thankful to Minister for Health Abdul Qadir Patel and Secretary Health Dr Mohammad Fakhar-i-Alam who gave us full support and confidence that we can eradicate the virus from the environmental samples of the city,” he said.
Dr Zia said special focus was given on missed children and it was ensured that every child would be vaccinated.
Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of five years. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death. While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this disease.
Each time a child under the age of five is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased. Repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries to become polio-free except Pakistan and Afghanistan.

9,Pakistan faces shortage of trained humanitarian workers: speakers,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been facing shortage of trained humanitarian workers with global experience as years ago it...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been facing shortage of trained humanitarian workers with global experience as years ago it had disallowed humanitarian international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) to operate in the country.
The country needs to align disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies as unprecedented monsoon conditions will continue to occur ostensibly. Disallowing INGOs over security concerns could be valid but their absence has created a grave and continued human security issue.
Millions of people hit by the worst floods in Pakistan’s history of six decades need humanitarian aid, tents, toilets, hygiene kits, sanitary pads, and cash for quick response, rescue and recovery.
This was the crux of a discussion over a twitter space organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) wherein experts with a humanitarian background highlighted a number of policy options for adequate response, recovery and rehabilitation.
Speaking at the occasion, SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qayyum Suleri said when losses are more than the 2010 floods, a bigger response and recovery plan backed by adequate resources should be made leaving aside political differences and considerations. He said that the damages will result into livelihood losses and food insecurity.
“Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) is a great cash disbursement programme as social safety net. Those who are not registered, they could be taken on board and cash transfer should start as soon as possible so that people start returning to normalcy and markets are up and running,” he said.
Head of Pakistan Humanitarian Forum Syed Shahid Kazmi said: “We need to prioritise providing cooked food, nutritious dry food items, drinking water, medical camps, fodder and other veterinary services for livestock, de-watering, mosquito nets and shelters with temporary toilets.”
He said under such circumstances, there was a need to provide women and children safe spaces to protect them against violence. He hoped that once the United Nations flash appeal will be launched, much of the humanitarian funding will come to Pakistan which may be helpful in protecting people from hunger and diseases.
A leading expert on Disaster Management, Syed Waqar Shirazi gave a situation overview on the impacts of floods calling for a real time assessment of the losses and damages and impacts on the people and infrastructure. He said power and telephone signals were cut in the flood-hit areas which hampered rescue work. The floods damaged standing crops such as rice, sugarcane and cotton, and seeds for future crops were also washed away. He warned against ensuing epidemics as a result of standing water.
Mr Shirazi said this was the result of disallowing humanitarian INGOs to operate in the country.
Humanitarian policy specialist Dr Shafqat Munir Ahmad said: “We need to update national, provincial, and district level development plans making them risk-sensitive. We need to align disaster risk reduction (DRR) policies with the commitments under Sendai Framework on DRR. Unprecedented monsoon will continue to occur ostensibly linked to climate change, so we have to put in place proper preparedness and DRR plans at community level.”
He called for allowing global humanitarian actors to restart their operations on a long-term basis by providing them an enabling environment. 
Writer and Environmentalist Zofeen T. Ebrahim said that youth have a passion to support the flood victims but they were not trained in humanitarian work which causes trouble in reaching out to the people. She called for providing cooked food and tents to give immediate relief to the flood-affected population. She said that banning humanitarian INGOs was not a good decision as they used to train our human resources in handling emergencies.
Senior developmental journalist, Moazzam Bhatti was of the opinion that media can play a great role provided it is given access to assessment data. Appeals through media always draw funds and humanitarian support from general masses and philanthropists.
Climate scientist Dr Fahad Saeed gave a suggestion that Pakistan should build its case at the forthcoming COP27 in Egypt based on scientifically tested data that the losses incurred in floods are related to climate change so that the country can access the climate fund set aside for this purpose. 
He said heat waves and floods impact communities largely and there is a need to protect the people through strong early warning, preparedness, and adaptation measures.
A speaker Dr Imran Khalid said that the areas submerged are prone to such incidents in the future as well so there is a need to build safety bonds to protect people and livestock, and build reservoirs to harvest rainwater. He called for urgent action to make communities resilient against such shocks as their resilience has been marred due to multiple crises.

Locals of the area said workers were busy in routine quarrying near Salargah. Soon after the incident, people working in the nearby plants rushed to the site and started a rescue operation.
Later, bodies of the two labourers identified as 30-year-old Jamal and 25-year-old Muzzafar were retrieved from the debris and an injured Sarfaraz was retrieved from the debris and shifted to a hospital. Bodies of the dead workers were handed over to their heirs. Taxila police registered a case and launched further investigation.
Gulab Khan, one of the eyewitnesses, said he was working at another stone crusher plant when he heard a big bang and all of sudden the clouds of mud spread everywhere. He said that he helped retrieve three people from the debris.
Haji Nazakat, a dumper driver who was present at the site, told reporters that he was waiting to fill his vehicle with stone crush when all of a sudden, one portion of the hill collapsed with heavy noise and for a few minutes nothing was seen except dust and mud.
He said later with the help of shawls and other construction machinery, the debris was removed and the people trapped under it were evacuated to nearby hospitals in the area.
The accidents at stone crushing plants in Taxila and adjourning areas are not uncommon; given poor working conditions, labourers often suffer at these sites. Many workers reportedly suffer from pulmonary problems, besides other illnesses, as workplace safety is neither practiced nor monitored at most of the plants.

11,CDA makes all-out efforts  to launch Bhara Kahu bypass project,"We have engaged FWO and hopefully work on project will start in second week of September, official says.","ISLAMABAD: On the directive of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) is making all-out efforts to start work on the much-delayed Bhara Kahu bypass project and a topographic survey of the road is in progress.
Sources told Dawn that the new CDA chairman retired Capt Mohammad Usman had prioritised the project and after a meeting at Prime Minister Office on Friday he also inspected the project site.
The sources said a topographic survey of the project was in progress which will be completed in a few days after which the engineering design of the bypass will be completed before finalising PC-I.
“Since the prime minister is directly monitoring and the chairman is fully focusing on the project, hopefully, all the prerequisite formalities will be completed in a week or so. We have already engaged Frontier Work Organisation (FWO) and it is expected that the formal construction work would be started during the second week of September,” said an official of the CDA.

We have engaged FWO and hopefully work on project will start in second week of September, says official

The prime minister has fixed a four-month deadline for completion of the project. “Once started, this project could be completed within four months,” the official said.
As per preliminary working of the CDA, the bypass would be five kilometres, including one km elevated road (flyover), with two interchanges at the starting and near the ending point.
It will start from Murree Road near Quaid-i-Azam University stop and after passing through Kayani Road and Bhara Kahu’s Friday bazaar will again touch Murree Road near the Jugi stop. 
From there, it will have a one-km flyover which will culminate at the end of Bhara Kahu.
CDA officials said that the cost of the project will be finalised while preparing PC-I, adding tentatively the worth of the project will be over five billion rupees. They said the CDA was also checking if construction of one-km flyover could be avoided and instead of the flyover the existing roads could be expanded. However, the officials said apparently there was no capacity in the existing roads for expansion and the CDA will have to go for a flyover.
“We have made our mind; the five-km project will have four-km road and one km flyover. But, yes, we are also checking the option of expansion of the roads but ultimately we will have to go for the flyover,” an official of the civic agency said.
The prime minster earlier this month had stated that completing the Bhara Kahu bypass within four months was possible, adding his team had in the past completed major projects in Punjab in less than four months.
Former prime minister Imran Khan in April last year had laid the foundation of the bypass to provide an alternative route to those travelling towards Murree, Galyat and Kashmir. However, the project, which was 7.8km from Murree Road to Satra Meel, could not be started during the tenure of his government.
Now the CDA has shelved that project and instead of the 7.8km bypass it is going to construct a four-km road with one-km flyover, which according to the engineering wing, is cost-effective and doable in the shortest time.
The officials said that the earlier designed 7.8km project required more than two years for completion because of lot of cut and fill was involved in it as it.
“Therefore, we have shelved that project and are now working on the road-cum-flyover project,” said an engineer of the CDA. He said that alighment of 7.8km road project had already been finalised which would be used in future.

After this, work on a total of 100 schools of tehsils Murree, Kotli Sattian, Kahuta, Kallar Syedan and Sagri Circle have been completed. The staff of the Rawalpindi District Education Department spent time to complete the entire process.
Former Member of National Assembly (MNA) and PTI spokesman Sadaqat Ali Abbasi told Dawn that upgrading a school meant providing free government education to hundreds of families in a disadvantaged area.
He said that it was the promise of PTI to improve the education system in the hill station and adjoining areas. In the hilly area, he said that due to less girls’ schools, many talented girls have trouble getting a good education.
He said that the PTI government had already established Kohsar University allocating funds for its six campuses in different tehsils across the region, upgrading dozens of schools before that, allocating funds for their buildings and other facilities.
