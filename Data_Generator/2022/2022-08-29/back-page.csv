0,Alvi’s ‘mandatory’ parliamentary address becomes due,Presidency yet to receive a request from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs with joint sitting slated for Sept 22.,"ISLAMABAD: The mandatory address of the president to the joint sitting of parliament has become due with the start of the final parliamentary year of the National Assembly on August 14.
However, it seems the incumbent coalition government is in no hurry to fulfil this constitutional requirement as the Presi­dency is yet to receive a request from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs in this regard, sources at the Presidency told Dawn.
Article 56(3) of the Constitution states that “at the commencement of the first session after each general election to the National Assembly and at the commencement of the first session of each year, the president shall address both Houses assembled together and inform the Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament) of the causes of its summons”.
National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf has already adjourned the joint sitting of parliament twice, without assigning any reason, and now it is scheduled to be held on September 22. It is still not clear if the government will invite the president to address the joint sitting on Sept 22 or it will convene a special session for this purpose.

Presidency yet to ‘receive invite’ with joint sitting slated for Sept 22

On the other hand, the sources at the Presidency said the staff concerned had already prepared the draft of the speech which would soon be sent to President Alvi for approval. 
They said as per the past practice, they had sent letters to all the ministries, asking them to apprise the president of their performance during the previous parliamentary year. The speech, they said, had been prepared after receiving input from all the ministries.
According to Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Raza Rabbani, it has been a tradition in countries having parliamentary democracy that a president delivers a written speech provided to him by the sitting government. However, he said, the president could make changes in the text without changing the context. He said that since it was merely a tradition, a number of former presidents in Pakistan had preferred to deliver their own written speeches.
The members of both houses then hold a general debate on the president’s address for which no time frame has been given in the Constitution or the rules of the two houses. 
President Alvi had in the past remained a target of severe criticism by the previous opposition parties, now sitting in the government, for allegedly undermining parliament by issuing a record number of ordinances under the PTI government. 
The opposition had also threatened to move a resolution for his impeachment when the Supreme Court overturned his notifications regarding the appointment of the members of the Election Commission of Pakistan and the extension in the tenure of Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa. 
President Alvi had refused to administer the oath to Shehbaz Sharif after his election as the country’s prime minister in April this year following the ouster of Imran Khan from the office through a vote of no confidence.
President Alvi came under criticism again when he refused to give his assent to the election reforms and NAB amendment bills despite their passage from the National Asse­mbly and the Senate. Mr Alvi has already addressed parliament four times since assuming office in September 2018 when his party, the PTI, was ruling the country. He always showered praise on the PTI.
Parliamentary experts say that this time, the president will be confronted with a different situation as he will be required to review the performance of two different governments. 
Besides reviewing the eight-month performance of the former ruling PTI, the president will also have to analyse the four-month rule of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government comprising his political rivals.
Last year, Dr Alvi addressed the joint sitting of the two houses of parliament on September 13 amid strong protests by the then opposition parties. “Shout but accept the reality that the country is passing through the path of industrial growth,” the president had said while praising the PTI government and responding to the opposition’s protest and shouting.
The opposition members led by then-opposition leader Shebaz Sharif and PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari raised slogans when the president started his speech, surrounded the speaker’s dais and later boycotted the session, providing him an environment conducive to completing his speech amid applauds through desk-thumping by the treasury members.
Interestingly, the president had addressed parliament with an empty press gallery. It was for the first time in the country’s parliamentary history that the National Assembly Secretariat barred journalists from covering the session.

1,US warships pass Taiwan strait as China ‘warns against provocation’,"WASHINGTON: Two US Navy warships sailed through international waters in the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, the American...","WASHINGTON: Two US Navy warships sailed through international waters in the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, the American navy said, the first such transit since China staged unprecedented military drills around the island earlier this month.
In a statement, the US Navy said the transit “demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific.”
The US Navy, confirming a Reuters report, said cruisers Chancellorsville and Antietam were carrying out the ongoing operation. Such operations usually take eight to 12 hours to complete and are closely monitored by China’s military.
“These [US] ships transited through a corridor in the strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal state,” the US Navy said.
The Chinese military’s Eastern Theatre Command said it was following the ships and warning them.
“Troops in the theatre remain on high alert and are ready to thwart any provocation at any time,” it added in a statement.
Taiwan’s defence ministry said the ships were sailing in a southerly direction and that its forces were observing but that “the situation was as normal”.
In recent years US warships, and on occasion those from allied nations such as Britain and Canada, have routinely sailed through the strait, drawing the ire of China which claims Taiwan against the objections of its democratically elected government. 
Washington diplomatically recognises Beijing over Taipei, but  maintains de facto relations with Taiwan and supports the island’s right  to decide its future. The narrow Taiwan Strait has been a frequent source of military tension since the defeated Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the communists, who established the People’s Republic of China.
Tensions in the Taiwan Strait soared to their highest level in years this month after US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taipei — a trip that infuriated China which saw it as a US attempt to interfere in its internal affairs. 
Beijing reacted furiously, staging days of air and sea exercises around the self-ruled island.
Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan was followed around a week later by a group of five other US lawmakers, with China’s military responding by carrying out more exercises near the island.
Senator Marsha Blackburn, a US lawmaker on the Senate Commerce and Armed Services committees, arrived in Taiwan on Thursday on the third visit by a U.S. dignitary this month, defying pressure from China to halt the trips.
The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has sought to keep tension between Washington and Beijing from boiling over into conflict, reiterating that congressional trips are routine.
The United States has no formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.Taiwan sees China’s growing military drill near island 
Taiwan says the People’s Republic of China has never ruled the island and so has no claim to it, and that only Taiwan’s 23 million people can decide their future. Taiwan’s defence ministry said it detected 23 Chinese aircraft and eight Chinese ships operating around Taiwan on Sunday, as Beijing continues its military activities near the island.
That included seven Chinese aircraft that crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally acts as an unofficial barrier between the two sides, it added.

2,Clashes in Libya leave 32 dead before tentative calm,Rival administrations of Abdulhamid Dbeibah and Fathi Bashagha are vying for control of Tripoli.,"TRIPOLI: Flights resumed and shops re-opened in Libya’s capital Tripoli on Sunday after clashes between backers of rival governments killed at least 32 people and sparked fears of major new conflict.
Armed groups had exchanged fire that damaged several hospitals and set buildings on fire starting on Friday evening, the worst fighting in the Libyan capital since a landmark 2020 ceasefire.
A cautious calm had set in by Saturday evening and the health ministry said on Sunday morning that 32 people had been killed and 159 wounded during the clashes.
The fighting came after months of mounting tensions between backers of Abdulhamid Dbeibah and Fathi Bashagha, whose rival administrations are vying for control of the North African country which has seen more than a decade of violence since a 2011 uprising.

Rival administrations of Abdulhamid Dbeibah and Fathi Bashagha are vying for control of Tripoli

Dbeibah’s administration, installed in the capital as part of a United Nations-led peace process last year, has so far prevented Bashagha from taking office there, arguing that the next administration should be the product of elections.
Bashagha was appointed by Libya’s eastern-based parliament earlier this year and is backed by powerful eastern military chief Khalifa Haftar, whose 2019 attempt to seize the capital by force turned into a year-long civil war.
Bashagha, a former interior minister, had initially ruled out the use of violence to take power in Tripoli but subsequently hinted that he could resort to force.
Libya plunged into chaos following the 2011 overthrow and killing of its leader Moammar Qadhafi in a Nato-backed uprising, with myriad armed groups and foreign powers moving to fill the power vacuum.
Certain armed groups seen as neutral in the latest crisis moved to back Dbeibah this weekend to push back Bashagha’s second attempt to enter the capital.
Both sides exchanged blame on Saturday while world powers appealed for calm.
Shifting sands 
The UN’s Libya mission called for “an immediate cessation of hostilities”, deploring “indiscriminate medium and heavy shelling in civilian-populated neighbourhoods”.
On Saturday evening, Dbeibah posted a video of himself surrounded by bodyguards and greeting fighters supporting his administration.
Wearing a blue shirt and accompanied by his personal guard, he shook hands and took selfies with supporters.
“We won’t leave this country to the scoundrels,” he said in the video posted on his Twitter account under the title “end of the aggression”.
He said on Sunday he would create two committees to survey the damage from the fighting.
Dbeibah’s Government of National Unity said fighting had broken out after talks to avoid bloodshed in the western city collapsed.
Bashagha denied such talks had taken place, and accused Dbeibah’s “illegitimate” administration of “clinging to power”.
Local media reported late Satur­day that a group of pro-Bashagha militias that had been making their way to the capital from Misrata later turned back.
The fighting prompted several airlines to cancel flights in and out of the only working airport in the capital, and high school examinations set for the end of August were postponed.
But flights resumed and shops reopened on Sunday morning, while the University of Tripoli announced that exams set for Monday would go ahead as originally planned, annulling an earlier postponement.
On Saturday evening, Dbeibah ordered the arrest of anyone involved in the “attack on Tripoli”, both civilian and military.
A pro-GNU force from Misrata — the hometown of both Dbeibah and Bashagha — said on Sunday it had arrested several people involved in the attack.
But analysts said the crisis was far from resolved, with the capital controlled by a multitude of armed groups with shifting alliances described by analyst Wolfram Lacher as “a never-ending story”.
“The armed groups that found themselves on the same side in yesterday’s Tripoli fighting will tomorrow clash over turf, positions and budgets,” he wrote on Twitter.
“The factions that were pro-Dbeibah yesterday will challenge him tomorrow.”

3,Mossad chief to meet top US officials on Iran deal,"Mossad chief David Barnea will be visiting Washington in a week, official says.","JERUSALEM: The head of Israel’s Mossad spy agency will visit the United States in early September for talks on the possible revival of the Iran nuclear deal, an official said on Sunday.
The announced visit is the latest in the Jewish state’s push to sway Western powers from a deal to return to the landmark 2015 deal with Tehran.
Israel says a deal would facilitate the funding of ‘Iran-supported militants’, while not preventing Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon — a goal Iran has always denied.
Mossad chief David Barnea will “be visiting Washington in a week to participate in closed door meetings in Congress on the Iran deal,” a senior Israeli official said on condition of anonymity, without providing further details.
Earlier on Sunday, Prime Minister Yair Lapid said Israel’s “diplomatic fight” against the deal included its national security adviser and defence minister holding recent meetings in the United States.
“We are making a concerted effort to ensure the Americans and Europeans understand the dangers involved in this agreement,” Lapid said, stressing what was signed in 2015 was “not a good deal,” and that the one currently being formulated entails “greater dangers.” 
In 2018, then-US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the agreement designed to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. His successor Joe Biden has sought to return to the deal, and after almost a year-and-a-half of talks, recent progress has put the Jewish state on edge.

4,"Cyber security deficiency led to data theft at SECP, report finds",The Nati­onal Telecommunication and Information Security Board has approached the SECP for a briefing on the matter.,"ISLAMABAD An initial report suggests that the data stolen from the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan’s web­site recently was mainly due to the absence of a proper and updated cyber security mechanism. 
A group of hackers scrapped off data of the commission’s directors by using a weak digital link at its website. The initial report, however, suggested the hacking could have been averted had the department conducted in time a test known as “vulnerability and penetration testing” for its website and IT systems, which was due in February this year. Incidentally, the SECP has yet to carry out the test. 
While the data scrapped from the SECP website incl­uded the names of companies and their directors, three items of crucial back-end information were siphoned off by the hackers — the CNIC numbers, permanent addresses and names of the directors’ fathers.
Some of this information has been placed at a website, www.companieshouse.pk, and the SECP, with the cooperation of the Pakistan Tele­communication Authority (PTA), has been able to close it down. The authorities have been asked to cancel the domain registration of companieshouse.pk.
Meanwhile, a federal government agency, the Nati­onal Telecommunication and Information Security Board  (NTISB), has approached the SECP for a briefing on the matter. The briefing is scheduled for Sept 1.
Sources told Dawn that the NTISB had requested a security agency to be part of the briefing as it was aimed at ensuring data safety in all government departments as well as in regulatory bodies. The NTISB advises the federal government on security aspects of information and telecommunication technology. Its board includes heads of Nadra, PTA  and NTC.
Although the SECP has not confirmed it, sources in the government say NTISB experts have already started the preliminary work and the second phase of investigations,  including the ground check of SECP, will be conducted after the SECP briefing.
In reply to a question, an official said the quality assurance team had executed the initial vulnerability scan and all weak links at the website had been strengthened.
“All the application programming secret keys used for data exchange with government entities have been changed, and a third-party security audit firm to conduct an independent Vuln­erability and Penetration Testing (VAPT) of website has been hired,” a spokesperson said. 
Debate continues at senior levels in the SECP over conducting an independent inquiry over the hacking not only to determine flaws in cyber security but also to ensure that none of the human resource in the commission was linked with the data siphoning by hackers.

5,‘Sight to behold’: tourists flock to Florida for Moon rocket launch,"MERRITT ISLAND: Seeing a rocket blast off to the Moon is “a once-in-a-lifetime thing to experience,” says Joanne...","MERRITT ISLAND: Seeing a rocket blast off to the Moon is “a once-in-a-lifetime thing to experience,” says Joanne Bostandji.
The 45-year-old has travelled all the way from northern England to the US state of Florida with her husband and two children for a space-themed vacation, and they’re prepared to make sure they don’t miss a second of the action as NASA’s newest and most powerful rocket is scheduled to launch for the first time Monday.
“The plan is to drive very early in the morning and get a spot” on Cocoa Beach, she said, not far from the Kennedy Space Centre.
“I know it’s going be from a far distance, but I still think it’s going to be a sight to behold,” Bostandji said as the family waited to enter a park dedicated to space exploration.
Between 100,000 and 200,000 visitors are expected to attend the launch of the mission, called Artemis 1, which will propel an empty capsule to the Moon as part of a test for future crewed flights.
The “historic nature” of Monday’s flight, the first of several as the United States returns to the Moon, “certainly has increased public interest,” Meagan Happel of Florida’s Space Coast Office of Tourism said.
Traffic jams are expected to start by 4am, with the launch scheduled at 8:33am.
And even more people might show up if the launch faces a weather delay, as the make-up date falls on a weekend.
Space cruise
Sabrina Morley was able to find an apartment to rent not far from the beach, and plans to bring her two children and a few dozen other people on a boat chartered for the occasion by a company called Star Fleet Tours.
For $95 a ticket, “we’ll go out into the ocean as close as they can get to the launch and we’ll watch the launch from the boat,” she said.
“I’ve never been this close to a launch before,” said the 43-year-old, who grew up in Orlando, less than an hour away.
As a child, she could see space shuttles taking off from her backyard, like “an orange ball of smoke” rising into the sky.
“We would hear the sonic booms,” she remembered.
Morley likes that NASA’s Artemis program aims to land a woman on the Moon for the first time, with a crew to head up in 2025 at the earliest.
“Representation matters,” she said, glancing at her two-year-old daughter, who is already wearing an imitation astronaut helmet on her head.
Good for business
The return of prestigious space launches is an economic boon for the region. A family of three will spend an average of $1,300 over four or five days, according to the tourism office.
On the main road to Merritt Island, the peninsula where the Kennedy Space Centre is located, Brenda Mulberry’s space memorabilia shop is packed with tourists.
As soon as they enter, visitors are greeted with Artemis T-shirts for sale, printed in-house — there were 1,000 copies made Saturday alone.
The last few days have seen an influx of customers, Mulberry, who founded “Space Shirts” in 1984, said.
“They’re just excited I think to see a NASA launch because the private space business is not so motivating to the people,” she said.
This rocket, called the SLS — a large model of which is displayed in front of her shop — “belongs to the people,” Mulberry said.
“It’s their rocket. It’s not a SpaceX rocket,” she added.
There is an air of nostalgia for the Apollo rocket program — it’s been 50 years since the last time a crewed mission went to the Moon, in 1972.
“My family, they had to go to the neighbour’s house to watch [the Apollo missions] because they didn’t have a television,” Bostandji, who was not yet born, said.
“Now we’re going to see it hopefully for real.”
