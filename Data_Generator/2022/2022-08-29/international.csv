0,Illegal ‘Twin Towers’ outside Delhi demolished,"NOIDA: India demolished two residential high-rise buildings outside New Delhi on Sunday, in a dramatic spectacle...","NOIDA: India demolished two residential high-rise buildings outside New Delhi on Sunday, in a dramatic spectacle carried live on television channels after days of excited media build-up.
The destruction of the 100-metre-high  “Twin Towers” in Noida, home to a concrete forest of similar structures, was also a rare example of India getting tough on corrupt developers and officials.
The 32 floors of  “Apex” and the 29 of  “Ceyane”, containing between them nearly 1,000 apartments that were never inhabited in nine years of legal disputes, were brought down in seconds, creating an immense cloud of dust and debris.
The controlled implosions using 3,700 kilograms (8,160 pounds) of explosives were India’s biggest demolition to date, local media reported.
Thousands of people, as well as stray dogs, had to be evacuated before the blast, including from neighbouring high-rises, one of which was reportedly just nine metres away.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to nearby buildings but a local official told reporters that the operation had gone  “largely as planned”.
Indian media reported minute details of the demolition, including the number of holes drilled for the charges (9,642) and the volume of debris created (80,000 tonnes).
TV news channel Times Now, which like others ran a countdown timer and showed little else on Sunday morning, called it the  “mother of all demolitions” of the  “towers of shame”.
Police shut a busy adjacent expressway, where on Saturday motorists stopped to take final selfies with the towers in the backdrop.
Top court
The legal dispute over the towers went all the way to India’s Supreme Court, which ruled last year that the buildings breached safety regulations and that the developers colluded with corrupt authorities.
The world’s fastest-growing major economy has seen a construction boom in the last two decades, which has also given rise to a nexus of corruption involving politicians, bureaucrats and powerful builders. Developers often sidestep many construction, urban-planning and environmental regulations, usually with impunity. The outskirts of major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore have become traps for middle-class buyers who invest in projects that are never completed or get drawn into similar legal sagas.
In Delhi’s suburbs of Noida and Greater Noida — where the towers were demolished on Sunday — it is estimated that more than 100 residential towers have been abandoned by builders, making these areas look like ghost cities.
Uday Bhan Singh Teotia, one of a group of residents whose case against private developer Supertech led to the demolition order, said before the event that it would be a vindication of his legal battle. “The two new towers that they constructed were blocking everything — our air and sunlight,” Teotia, who lives close to the structures, said.
Demolitions of residential buildings are rare in India, with builders often escaping with penalties or abandoning projects midway if they fall foul of the law. Four luxury high-rises in the southern state of Kerala were demolished for breaking environmental rules in 2020.
Lawyer Jayant Bhushan, who represented the complainants in the case against Supertech, said builders must clean up their act to win back home-buyers’ trust.
“Unless builders follow rules, it will be hapless buyers who will end up burning their fingers again and again,” he said.

1,Bangladesh to import wheat  from Russia after India ban,"DHAKA: Bangladesh is set to import 500,000 tonnes of wheat at $430 a tonne from Russia in a government-to-government...","DHAKA: Bangladesh is set to import 500,000 tonnes of wheat at $430 a tonne from Russia in a government-to-government deal as it battles to secure supplies amid surging prices, two government officials with the direct knowledge of matter said on Sunday.
The south Asian country, among importers hit by disruption to Ukrainian and Russian grain exports, has been exploring ways to import the grain since its biggest supplier India banned export of the grain in May.
The deal with Russia will be signed in a few days and the shipment will take place in phases by January, one of the officials said.
Bangladesh will pay in US dollars for the import, the other official said, adding the cost included freight, insurance and unloading.Salman Fazlur Rahman, the prime minister’s private industry and investment adviser, said that Bangladesh is buying grain and fertiliser from Russia but did not elaborate.
“We can make payments in dollars for imports of food grains and fertilisers from Russia through 24 global banks, with no restriction on such imports,” he said.
After India’s export ban, Bangladesh tried via international tenders to shore up government stock that hit its lowest in three years earlier this year, but had to cancel some tenders because of the extremely high prices in a turbulent global market.
Bangladesh is a major importer of black sea wheat but no supplies have reached the country since the Russia-Ukraine war began in February.
The country imported 5.4 million tonnes of wheat in year to June 2021, with 24pc of its supplies coming from India, 21pc from Russia and 17pc from Ukraine.
The government, which has already been struggling to contain the impact of soaring commodity prices, could face further trouble as it raised prices of oil it imports and resells domestically by as much as 51.7pc early this month.

2,"Ukraine tense as N-plant, nearby towns shelled",Ukrainian nuclear company Energoatom says it has no new information about attacks on the plant.,"KYIV: Russian artillery fired at Ukrainian towns across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant overnight, local officials said on Sunday, adding to residents’ anguish as reports of shelling around the plant fuelled fears of a radiation disaster.
Russia’s defence ministry said there was more Ukrainian shelling of the plant over the past 24 hours, just a day after Moscow and Kyiv traded accusations of targeting Europe’s biggest nuclear plant, which has prompted grave international concern.
Ukrainian nuclear company Energoatom said it had no new information about attacks on the plant.
Captured by Russian troops in March, but still run by Ukrainian staff, the complex on the southern front line of the war has been one of the major hotspots in the six-month-old conflict.
The US State Department said in a statement on Sunday that Moscow did not want to acknowledge the grave radiological risk at the Zaporizhzhia plant and had blocked a draft agreement on nuclear non-proliferation because it mentioned such risk.
Regional governor Oleksandr Starukh said on Telegram on Sunday that Russian forces struck residential buildings in the region’s main city of Zaporizhzhia, about a two-hour drive from the plant, and the town of Orikhiv further east. On Saturday, Starukh told Ukrainian television residents were being taught how to use iodine in case of a radiation leak.
Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnipro river from the plant in its daily report, while the RIA agency quoted the Russian defence ministry as saying its air force struck a Motor Sich plant in the region where helicopters were repaired.
Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said nine shells fired by the Ukrainian artillery in two separate attacks landed in the nuclear plant’s grounds.
“At present, full-time technical personnel are monitoring the technical condition of the nuclear plant and ensuring its operation. The radiation situation in the area of the nuclear power plant remains normal,” he said in a statement.
The United Nations and Kyiv have called for a withdrawal of military equipment and personnel from the plant to ensure it is not a target.
Continent at risk
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Russian forces had turned the plant into military base, putting the whole continent at risk, and had no business being there. “Russian military must get out of the plant,” he said on Twitter.
The UN nuclear watchdog IAEA is waiting for clearance for its officials to visit the plant, which its head said on Thursday should be  “very, very close”
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned on Friday the situation at Zaporizhzhia remained  “very risky” a day after it took hours to reconnect two of its reactors to the grid after shelling cut them off.
On Ukraine’s eastern front, Ukrainian forces halted the latest Russian attempt to advance on the town of Sloviansk, Kyiv’s military said in its daily report.

According to a document filed in a San Francisco court, Facebook said it is submitting a draft  “agreement in principle” and has requested a stay of proceedings for 60 days to finalise it. The social network did not indicate the amount or terms of the agreement in the class action.
When asked, Facebook said late on Saturday night they had  “no comment to share at this time.” The deal comes as Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg and former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, who announced her resignation in June, were due to testify in court in September as part of the scandal.
In a lawsuit initiated in 2018, Facebook users accused the social network of violating privacy rules by sharing their data with third parties including the firm Cambridge Analytica, which was linked to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

4,Six killed as truck ploughs into Dutch revellers,A  46-year-old driver from Spain has been arrested.,"NIEUW BEIJERLAND: Dutch police on Sunday said six people were killed and seven others hurt after a truck ran off the top of a dike road and ploughed into revellers at a neighbourhood barbecue.
The accident happened around 6pm on Saturday when the Spanish-registered lorry went off the road in the village of Nieuw-Beijerland, 30 kilometres (18 miles) south of Rotterdam.
The victims were three women aged 28, 32 and 75, and three men aged 41, 50 and 62, all from the local area, police said. One of the injured was in a critical condition in hospital.
Police had first confirmed at least two dead after the vehicle drove into the crowded community barbecue, which Dutch news reports said was being hosted by an ice-skating club.
“We now have six people killed and seven injured, one seriously after yesterday’s accident,” police spokeswoman Mirjam Boers said. “We are still investigating what exactly happened,” she said.
Photographs from the scene identified the truck as belonging to the El Mosca company, based in Spain.
Boers confirmed the 46-year-old driver from Spain had been arrested  “and was not under the influence of alcohol,” at the time of the accident. “He was arrested for causing a fatal accident and serious bodily injury.
His role in the incident is under investigation. For the time being, we are keeping all scenarios about the facts open,” police said in a statement. Residents were laying flowers at the location of the accident on Sunday, a journalist at the site said. A police car stood guard at the scene.
‘Unimaginable sadness’
Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima said they were  “shocked” by the tragedy.
“We are shocked and moved by the terrible accident in Nieuw-Beijerland last night in which so many people were killed. An unimaginable sadness within this close-knit community,” the king and queen said in an official message. 
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte also sent condolences. “Terrible news ... my thoughts are with the victims and relatives of this terrible drama. I wish them a lot of strength,” Rutte said on Twitter.

 





 
Quoting witnesses, the Rijnmond regional broadcaster said the truck stopped for a moment at a T-junction on the narrow Zuidzijdsedijk dike, before taking off and ploughing into the revellers. Three of the victims — a mother, son and daughter-in-law who was eight months pregnant — came from the same family, the broadcaster reported, quoting a local church announcement.
The incident has shaken the tight-knit community of the Nieuw-Beijerland region with police calling for more witnesses to help with the investigation.

5,Indonesian knights keep medieval sword-fighting alive,Nearly 50 people have recently joined the group in Jakarta and its sister branch in the Javan city of Bandung.,"JAKARTA: Armed with blunt swords, a dozen would-be chevaliers are put through their paces in a gallant effort to keep alive European medieval martial arts taught hundreds of years ago.
But this is not a scene from Game of Thrones or the Adventures of Robin Hood — it’s a breezy Sunday afternoon in the middle of Jakarta, one of the world’s biggest megacities.
The fighters are practicing sword-fighting techniques that were honed across Europe from the 14th to 18th centuries — known as Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA).
After a quick warm-up, members of the Gwaith-i-Megyr group take turns to show off their swordsmanship outside the massive Gelora Bung Karno stadium.
“The training is beyond my expectation. As we spar using weapons, the adrenaline rush from attacking and defending is more keenly felt compared to hand-to-hand combat,” said Gede Indra Krisega, a 23-year-old civil servant.
The Gwaith-i-Megyr was established in 2016 after several members of a local fan club of English author JRR Tolkien — who wrote the Lord of the Rings trilogy — showed an interest in HEMA.
Nearly 50 people have recently joined the group in Jakarta and its sister branch in the Javan city of Bandung.
The group’s name means  “Fellowship of Swordsmen” and comes from the Sindarin language, one of the fictional languages created by Tolkien in his novels, said Ahmad Rizal Soulisa, one of the founding members of the group. HEMA enthusiasts usually pore over manuals left behind by past masters as they learn, train and revive the moves, Soulisa said.

6,Kurdish forces move to halt ‘brutal torture’ at IS camp in Syria,AL HOL: US-backed Syrian Kurdish security forces have launched a new operation targeting sleeper cells of the...,"AL HOL: US-backed Syrian Kurdish security forces have launched a new operation targeting sleeper cells of the militant Islamic State group in a large northeastern detention camp where violence has reached record levels.
At least 44 people including 14 women have been killed this year in the al-Hol camp, which holds internal refugees and families of suspected IS fighters.
“We launched the campaign at this time because of the urgent need brought on by the escalation and increase in violent cases by IS cells in al-Hol camp,” said Ali Hassan, a spokesperson for the internal security forces operating in Syria’s semi-autonomous northeast.
He said the victims showed signs of  “brutal torture”, were often killed with silenced pistols or rifles and their bodies hidden in sewage pipes.
“Compared to last year, there is an increase in the pace of operations within the camp, especially during and after the attempted prison break,” Hassan said.
He was referring to a January riot in a northeast Syrian prison, where IS suspects attempting a jailbreak took over part of the detention facility and dozens escaped.
Hassan said perpetrators of the violence in al-Hol likely had contact with IS units still roaming free.
Al-Hol houses around 55,000 people, including Syrians, Iraqis and other nationals who fled IS-held areas as the jihadists faced an onslaught by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.
The UN refugee agency in June described the situation at the camp as  “catastrophic” saying that an additional  “safe space” should be created to protect women and girls from attacks.
The agency said humanitarian organisations had had their facilities vandalised and equipment looted and that repeated lockdowns due to security incidents in the camp meant aid workers had reduced access to people in need.

7,US blasts ‘cynical’ Russia for blocking UN nuclear text,The latest draft text had expressed  “grave concern” over military activities around Ukrainian power plants.,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Sunday denounced Russia’s  “cynical obstructionism” after Moscow blocked adoption of a joint declaration on nuclear non-proliferation following lengthy international negotiations at the United Nations.
The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which 191 signatories review every five years, aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, promote complete disarmament and promote cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Russia on Friday prevented the declaration’s adoption, saying it took issue with  “political” aspects of the text — a step criticised by Washington.
“After weeks of intensive but productive negotiations, the Russian Federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document” at the conclusion of the four-week NPT review conference, State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel said in a statement.
He said Moscow’s move was done  “in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine,” a major atomic facility that is currently occupied by the Russian military.
The latest draft text had expressed  “grave concern” over military activities around Ukrainian power plants, including Zapori­zhzhia, as well as over Ukraine’s loss of control of such sites and the negative impact on safety.“Despite Russia’s cynical obstruction, the fact that all other parties supported the final document demonstrates the treaty’s essential role in preventing nuclear proliferation,” the State Department’s Patel said.
He reiterated Washington’s call for Russia to end its military activity near Zaporizhzhia  “and return control of the plant to Ukraine.” 
Meanwhile, neutral and non-nuclear Austria on Saturday condemned the attitude at the talks of major powers, and not just Russia.
“While three-quarters of the 191 signatory states support credible progress for nuclear disarmament, it is mainly the nuclear-armed states, and above all Russia, which resisted,” the government in Vienna said in a statement.
It noted that contrary to treaty commitments, Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States are improving or expanding their stock of nuclear weapons.

8,Japan to push for African seat on UN Council,"The UN faces ""a moment of truth"", Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida says.","TUNIS: Japan will use its place on the United Nations Security Council to push for an African seat on the top world body, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said on Sunday.
“Japan reiterates its determination to redress the historical injustice against Africa of not being represented through a permanent membership on the Security Council,” Kishida told the Tokyo International Confer­ence on African Development in Tunis.
“In order for the UN to work effectively for peace and stability there is an urgent need to strengthen the UN as a whole through Security Council reform,” he said.
The UN faces “a moment of truth”, he added. Japan was among five countries elected in June to hold a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council for 2023 and 2024.
Kishida, speaking over live video from Tokyo after testing positive for Covid-19 days earlier, reiterated a pledge announced on Saturday to invest some $30 billion in Africa over the next three years.
He also announced that Japan would appoint a special envoy to the Horn of Africa, where a long drought has prompted the UN’s weather agency to warn this week of an “unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe”.
Kishida said Japan would pump $8.3 million into the troubled but gold-rich Liptako-Gourma tri-borders area between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso that has been ravaged by jihadist attacks in recent years.
The aid will aim to “develop good cooperation between residents and local authorities” and help improve administrative services for the area’s five million residents, he said.
The Japanese premier also promised aid to train police officers and support “fair and transparent” elections across the continent, pledging Japan’s support for the rule of law in Africa.
The UN Security Council is made up of 15 members, five of whom are permanent and have veto-wielding power: the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain. The other 10 positions are filled by other countries for two-year stints, five of which are announced each year.

9,US judge says she intends to name monitor for review of Trump papers seized by FBI,A special master can sometimes  be appointed to ensure that investigators do not review privileged information.,"WASHINGTON: A  US judge on Saturday said it was her  “preliminary intent” to grant  former president Donald Trump’s request to appoint a special master to  oversee a review of materials seized on Aug 8 from his Florida home during  an FBI raid.
US District Judge Aileen M. Cannon, who was  nominated by Trump in 2020, on Saturday also directed the Justice  Department to submit under seal more details  “specifying all property  seized pursuant to the search warrant.” 
Trump, in an Aug 22 speech, had also  demanded the Justice Department provide him a more detailed property  receipt outlining items the FBI seized from his Mar-a-Lago home during  its Aug 8 search, and asked investigators to return any items outside  the scope of the search warrant.
Cannon gave the government until  Tuesday to file a response to Trump’s request for a special master and  set a hearing for Thursday. Her order said she had not made a final  determination on Trump’s request.
A special master can sometimes  be appointed in highly sensitive cases to go through seized materials  and ensure that investigators do not review privileged information.
The  Justice Department has disclosed it was investigating Trump for  removing White House records because it believed he illegally held  documents including some involving intelligence-gathering and  clandestine human sources — among America’s most closely held secrets.
In  the affidavit, an unidentified FBI agent said the agency reviewed and  identified 184 documents  “bearing classification markings” containing   “national defence information” after Trump in January returned 15 boxes  of government records sought by the US National Archives.
The  search was part of a federal investigation into whether Trump illegally  removed and kept documents when he left office in January 2021 after  losing the 2020 election to President Joe Biden and whether Trump tried  to obstruct the probe.
Trump, a Republican who is considering  another presidential run in 2024, has described the court-approved  search at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach as politically motivated,  and on Friday again described it as a  “break-in.”
US Representative Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans joining Congress’s probe of the assault on the Capitol by Donald Trump supporters, accused members of his party of  “hypocrisy” for defending the former president’s handling of classified documents.
“The hypocrisy of folks in my party that spent years chanting lock her up about Hillary Clinton because of some deleted emails or quote unquote wiping a server are now out there defending a man who very clearly did not take the national security of the United States to heart,” Kinzinger said during an interview with NBC’s  “Meet the Press.” 
Trump and many other Republicans for years castigated his 2016 campaign rival former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for having used a private email server for some official public communications, some of which contained classified information.
Trump has regularly led political rallies with supporters chanting  “Lock her up.”  Kinzinger and Representative Liz Cheney are the two Republicans on the nine-member House special committee investigating the deadly Jan 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and Trump’s activities surrounding that day.
Kinzinger, who opted not to seek re-election, said that either in upcoming hearings or in a formal committee report, there will be  “more depth” revealed on Trump’s behavior during the riot. He added,  “One of the more intriguing things is going to be some of the financing ... a vast majority of this money was raised under ‘stop the steal’ with no intention of doing anything to stop the so-called steal.” 
Trump falsely claims that Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election through massive fraud, an assertion that has been rejected by several court rulings, the former president’s own Justice Department and even Republican-led investigations at the state level.

The incident took place on August 23 when Greece’s S-300 missile system on the island of Crete put a lock on Turkish F-16 jets flying at 10,000 feet west of Rhodes, Turkish defence ministry sources said.
That was  “incompatible with the spirit of (Nato) alliance” and amounted to  “hostile acts” under the Nato rules of engagement, the sources added.
“Despite this hostile action, (Turkish) jets completed their planned missions and returned to their base safely.” Greek defence ministry sources dismissed the allegations.
“Greece’s S-300 missile system has never put a lock on Turkish F-16 jets”, the sources said, according to state-run Ert television.
Turkiye has in recent months complained of what it calls provocative actions by Greece, saying such moves undermine peace efforts.

12,Egypt dims lights to boost foreign exchange reserves,"CAIRO: An economic crisis spurred by the Ukraine war is casting darkness upon Egypt’s streets, as the government...","CAIRO: An economic crisis spurred by the Ukraine war is casting darkness upon Egypt’s streets, as the government dims lights to free up energy for export and bolster hard currency reserves.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had an immediate impact on Egypt, the world’s biggest wheat importer which has relied on the ex-Soviet states for over 80 percent of its grain.
Egypt, which turned to the International Monetary Fund for a loan after the war erupted, is pumping more natural gas abroad to increase its foreign currency reserves — a move that has come in for criticism.
And while the government announced electricity rationing this month, signs of wastage elicit scorn.
“I see streetlights still working during daylight hours... and we’re suffering from high electricity bills,” said a disgruntled Cairo resident in his 30s.
The country’s vital tourism sector has also been hit by the Ukraine conflict, cutting the flow of holidaymakers to a country still hurting from the 2011 revolution and Covid-19 pandemic.
Economic growth slowed to 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021-22 against 7.7 percent last year, although annual expansion was 6.6 percent. Despite the better-than-expected ann­ual figure, the government said growth had tapered off in the wake of “global political and economic developments”.
Egypt’s monetary policy has been caught between a rock and a hard place since Russia invaded Ukraine in February.
Inflation hit a three-year high of 14.6 percent in July after Egypt devalued the pound, pushing up the price of imports and depleting forex reserves by $7.8 billion since February to $33.1 billion in July.
Capital flight
Egypt is negotiating an IMF loan to help mitigate fallout from the Ukraine war on the country, where 30 percent of the 103 million population lives in poverty. But the talks have stretched out for six months, raising eyebrows among analysts.
“The fact that talks with the IMF have dragged is probably a sign that some officials are reluctant to follow through on the Fund’s demands and would prefer to rely on support from the oil-flush Gulf economies,” London’s Capital Economics said.
“We need to speed up negotiations with the IMF,” said Hany Genena, an economist and lecturer at American University in Cairo.
“Since last week, there has been a severe shortage of dollars provided to importers by banks in various sectors.” Cairo had previously secured a $12-billion IMF loan in 2016 that required it to slash subsidies and devalue the pound. In 2020, Egypt received two more loans, including $5.4 billion tied to reforms and $2.8 billion to tackle Covid.
Genena said Egypt needed to undertake more  “drastic” reforms to restore its forex reserves, including a full float of the pound. Last week, as the currency plunged to a near all-time low of 19.1 to the dollar, central bank governor Tarek Amer resigned.
It was unclear why Amer quit, but Egyptian media suggested it was because of his reluctance to implement a full float.
James Swanston of Capital Economics said the currency needed to depreciate to 25 pounds to the dollar by the end of 2024  “to avoid external imbalances rebuilding”.
But $14.6 billion worth of investments has flown out of the country in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting concerns over the Ukraine war.
Capital Economics said, however, that investment pledges worth $22 billion from Gulf countries will  “go some way to alleviating external financing concerns”.
Gas lifeline
Among Egypt’s slate of measures to preserve foreign currency was a decision to let the pound slip 17 percent against the greenback in March.
The government said electricity rationing seeks to achieve  “an additional surplus — at an average of 15 percent of the natural gas pumped to power stations — that can be exported and bring in hard currency.” Among the measures to conserve energy were  “reducing lighting in streets and public squares.” Since 2018, Egypt has been ramping up its natural gas capacity, now setting its sights on an energy-hungry Europe, which is eager to decrease reliance on Russian gas.
The government announced this month  “exceptional aid to nine million families at a cost of $52 million per month,” but for many, the soaring cost of living had already done enough damage.
