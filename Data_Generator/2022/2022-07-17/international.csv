0,G20 finance talks end without joint communique,In place of a formal communique will be a 14-paragraph statement issued by Indonesia.,"BALI: A two-day meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 20 major economies ended on Saturday in Indonesia without a joint communique after Russia’s war in Ukraine divided the global forum.
During talks on the Indonesian resort island Bali, the finance chiefs looked for solutions to food and energy crises, while accusing Russian technocrats of exacerbating the problems.
US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers and Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Friday blamed the invasion of Ukraine for sending a shockwave through the global economy. In place of a formal communique would be a 14-paragraph statement issued by Indonesia, the G20 chair’s Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in closing remarks.
She said there was consensus on most of the document but two paragraphs would focus on members’ differences regarding the war’s impacts and how to respond. “I think this is the best result,” she said. Members also discussed sustainable finance, cryptocurrencies and international taxation on Saturday. 
Mulyani  said  “progress” was made on international tax rule changes that will  set a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15 per cent by 2024.
No place at talks
At the beginning of the second day of talks, Indonesian central bank governor Perry Warjiyo called on ministers and global finance leaders to concentrate on recovery in a world economy reeling from the Covid-19 pandemic.
The meeting took place after the International Monetary Fund slashed its global growth forecast, with another downgrade expected this month as US inflation stokes fears of a recession.
But the talks have been overshadowed by the Ukraine war after it roiled global markets, caused rising food prices and added to breakneck inflation.
The Kremlin calls the war a  “special military operation” and blames retaliatory Western sanctions for blocking food shipments and rising energy prices. Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Ukrainian Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko participated virtually in the meeting.
Russian Deputy Finance Minister Timur Maksimov attended the talks in person a week after Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov walked out of a G20 meeting over Western criticism of the invasion.
Maksimov was in the room as Western officials expressed their condemnation, according to a source present. Marchenko called for  “more severe targeted sanctions” against Moscow.

1,"Did ‘utmost’ for bankrupt  Sri Lanka, says Rajapaksa",COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s ousted president claims he did his  best to avoid an economic catastrophe but the pandemic...,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s ousted president claims he did his  best to avoid an economic catastrophe but the pandemic derailed his efforts, according to his resignation letter, read out to parliament on Saturday.
Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s brief note, sent from the safety of a safe haven in Singapore, blamed Covid-19 for the financial meltdown that triggered months of protests, culminating in his humiliating escape abroad.
“I have contributed my utmost for the country and in the future too, I will contribute,” Rajapaksa said in the letter, read to MPs by the parliamentary secretary general.
It was not clear whether he was signalling an intention to remain involved in politics from exile.
Rajapaksa claimed the country’s reserves were already low when he took office in November 2019 but official figures show Sri Lanka had $7.5 billion in foreign exchange reserves when he took over, dropping to just $1 million by the time he quit. The country is officially bankrupt.

2,Forest fires rage in scorching southwest Europe,Authorities in the French Alps have urged climbers seeking to ascend Mont Blanc to postpone their trip.,"LISBON: Southwest Eur­o­pe entered a sixth day of a summer heatwave on Saturday that has triggered devastating forest fires as parts of the continent braced for new temperature records early next week.
Firefighters in France, Portugal and Spain, as well as Greece, battled forest blazes that have ravaged thousands of hectares of land and killed several firefighters since the start of the week.
“The fire is still not under control,” said Ronan Lea­ustic, an official in Arcachon in southwest France’s Gironde region where firefighters battled to put out two forest blazes that have devoured 9,000 hectares (22,200 acres) since Tuesday.
Meteo France said temperatures will range between 35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit) and 40C in the south of France on Saturday, with new heat records expected on Monday.
Authorities in the French Alps have urged climbers seeking to ascend Mont Blanc, Europe’s highest mountain, to postpone their trip due to repeated rock falls caused by  “exceptional climatic conditions” and  “drought”.
The call comes after a section of Italy’s biggest Alpine glacier gave way at the start of the month, sending ice and rock hurtling down the mountain and killing 11 people, in a disaster officials blamed on climate change.
In Portugal, the meteorological institute forecast temperatures of up to 42C and thermometer readings were not expected to drop below 40C until next week.
The civil defence, however, took advantage of a slight drop in temperatures after a July record of 47C on Thursday to try to stamp out one last major fire in the north of the country.
“The risk of fires remains very high,” civil defence chief Andre Fernandes warned during a midday briefing.
“This is a weekend of extreme vigilance.” He spoke after an air tanker that had been fighting fires in northern Portugal crashed on Friday, killing its pilot.

3,Israel strikes Gaza Strip after rocket fire,The exchange of fire comes hours after US President Joe Biden visited Israel and the occupied West Bank.,"GAZA CITY: Israel hit the Gaza Strip before dawn on Saturday in what it said was a retaliatory strike for rocket fire from the Palestinian territory controlled by the Islamist movement Hamas.
The exchange of fire came hours after US President Joe Biden visited Israel and the occupied West Bank.
“A short while ago, IDF fighter jets struck a military site in the central Gaza Strip belonging to the Hamas terrorist organisation,” a statement from the Israel Defence Forces said.
“The military site consists of an underground complex containing raw materials used for the manufacturing of rockets,” it said, describing the facility as  “one of the most significant” of its kind in the territory.
“The strike on this site will significantly impede and undermine Hamas’ force-building capabilities,” it said, adding that Israel was responding to  “attacks from the Gaza Strip on Israeli territory”.
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem denounced the strikes, which the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said caused no injuries. WAFA said Israeli missiles were fired at two locations, one  “near a tourist resort” where nearby houses were severely damaged.
Balls of fire lit up the night sky over Gaza City after the strikes, which at one location left a hole in the earth beneath dislodged paving stones in front of a low-rise building.
A man later swept up shattered glass in front of what appeared to be an office.
During the night there had been two separate launches, each of two rockets, towards Israeli territory, the military said.
Warning sirens alerting residents to the rocket fire had sounded during the night in the city of Ashkelon and elsewhere in Israel’s south.
Israel’s military said one of the rockets had been intercepted while the other three fell on empty land.
Impoverished Gaza, home to 2.3 million Palestinians, has been under Israeli blockade since 2007 when Hamas seized power from the secular Fatah movement of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
With Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations moribund since 2014, the US delegation has been focusing on economic measures.
Biden announced an additional $200 million for the United Nations agency serving Palestinian refugees, which saw funding cut by the previous US president Donald Trump.
During a visit to a hospital in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, Biden pledged a $100 million aid package for medical institutions in the area.
He also announced plans to roll out infrastructure for 4G internet across the Gaza Strip and the West Bank by the end of next year, fulfilling a longstanding aspiration among Palestinians.
Biden earlier held talks in Jerusalem with Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid, during which a focal point was Iran’s nuclear programme and that country’s support for Hamas and other Islamist groups.
Israel occupied both the Gaza Strip and West Bank in the 1967 Six-Day War.
It withdrew from Gaza in 2005 but has maintained a blockade of the coastal territory since the Hamas takeover.

4,China Covid outbreak grows with millions under lockdown,The fast-spreading Omicron variant of the virus has been a major challenge for Chinese authorities.,"BEIJING: China on Saturday reported its highest number of coronavirus cases since May, with millions in lockdown this weekend as authorities persist with their zero-Covid policy.
Using snap lockdowns, long quarantines and mass testing, China is the last major economy still pursuing the goal of eliminating outbreaks, even as the strategy takes a heavy toll on the economy. China reported 450 local infections on Saturday, up from 432 a day earlier.
Most cases were asymptomatic. The rising wave of cases led to fresh restrictions this week in some parts of the country.
Lanzhou, the capital of northwestern Gansu province, ordered its 4.4 million residents to stay home starting on Wednesday, and a county in Anhui province went into lockdown from Friday. Beihai in the southern Guangxi region on Saturday also announced lockdowns in parts of two districts that are home to more than 800,000 people.
“Currently, the epidemic prevention and control situation in Beihai city is severe and complicated, and the risk of hidden transmission in the community is relatively high,” said a government notice announcing the restrictions. Earlier in the week, the steelmaking hub of Wugang in central Henan province announced a three-day lockdown over a single Covid case.
The fast-spreading Omicron variant of the virus has been a major challenge for Chinese authorities, as they try to limit the economic damage caused by Covid restrictions.
China logged its slowest second-quarter growth rate since the initial Covid outbreak, with GDP expanding just 0.4 percent on-year.

5,Myanmar suspends foreign loan repayments,YANGON: Myanmar’s central bank has ordered local companies and banks to suspend and reschedule repayment of ...,"YANGON: Myanmar’s central bank has ordered local companies and banks to suspend and reschedule repayment of foreign loans, according to local media, its latest effort to exert control over foreign currency flows.
The central bank issued the order on July 13, according to Myanmar Now, a news agency.
“According to foreign currency law and foreign currency management rules, the repayment of foreign loans including original and interest values should be suspended and licensed banks should rearrange with their customers regarding repayment schedule,” the central bank statement said. Central bank officials did not answer calls seeking comment.
The kyat currency’s plummet against the dollar has driven up fuel and food prices in a country already in crisis since the military seized power in a brutal coup last year, halting a decade of political and economic reforms.
To relieve some of that pressure, the central bank has announced a series of orders on local businesses depositing and exchanging foreign currency at local banks within one working day, and instructing ministries and local governments not to use foreign currencies for domestic transactions.

6,Jan 6 Capitol riot panel subpoenas Secret Service over missing texts,The message could be important in investigations into whether Trump and his advisers encouraged the insurrection.,"WASHINGTON: The US House committee investigating the Jan 6 assault on the Capitol said late on Friday night it had subpoenaed the Secret Service over questions surrounding missing text messages from the days surrounding the riot last year.
The inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Joseph Cuffari, told Congress earlier this week that his office has had difficulties obtaining records of text messages from the Secret Service, the law enforcement agency that protects the president, from Jan 5 and 6, 2021.
Representative Bennie Thompson, chairman of the Jan 6 committee, informed the agency’s director James Murray in a letter of the subpoena compelling the Secret Service to hand over the missing texts by Tuesday.
“The Select Committee seeks the relevant text messages, as well as any after action reports that have been issued in any and all divisions of the USSS pertaining or relating in any way to the events of Jan 6, 2021,” the letter, posted to the committee’s website, said.
The messages could be important in the House of Representatives and Justice Department investigations into whether Donald Trump and his close advisors encouraged the deadly insurrection by the former president’s supporters, which aimed to prevent the certification of his Democratic rival Joe Biden as the winner of the November 2020 election.

7,Russia says it is stepping up operations as more rockets hit Ukraine,"KYIV: Russia has ordered its forces in Ukraine to step up operations, its defence ministry said on Saturday, as...","KYIV: Russia has ordered its forces in Ukraine to step up operations, its defence ministry said on Saturday, as rockets and missiles pounded the country in the latest of a series of bombardments that Kyiv says have killed dozens of people in recent days.
In the latest strikes, missiles hit the northeastern town of Chuhuiv in Kharkiv region, killing three people including a 70-year-old woman, and wounding three more, the regional governor Oleh Synehubov said.
To the south, regional governor Valentyn Reznichenko said more than 50 Russian Grad rockets fell on the city of Nikopol, on the Dnipro River. Two people were killed, emergency services said. Ukraine says around 40 people have been killed in such attacks on urban areas in the last three days.
Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement on its website that Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had ordered military units to step up their operations to prevent strikes on eastern Ukraine and other territories controlled by Russia.
It said Shoigu  “gave the necessary instructions to further increase the actions of groups in all operational areas in order to exclude the possibility of the Kyiv regime launching massive rocket and artillery strikes on civilian infrastructure and residents of settlements in Donbas and other regions”.
The ministry said Shoigu had issued his order after listening to reports at a command centre from generals leading the  “South” and  “Centre” command groups of Russian forces operating in Ukraine, as well as other commanders.
It was not clear from the statement, or the silent footage provided, exactly when the meeting took place or whether Shoigu and the commanders were in Ukraine at the time.
Ukrainian rocket strikes using Western-supplied systems have destroyed more than 30 Russian military logistics centres in recent weeks and significantly reduced Russia’s attacking potential, Ukraine said on Friday.
While the focus of the war, now in its fifth month, has moved to Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, Russia forces have been striking cities elsewhere in the country with missiles and rockets in what has become an increasingly attritional conflict.
Moscow, which launched what it called its  “special military operation” against Ukraine on Feb 24 saying it aimed to root out what it termed dangerous nationalists, says it uses high-precision weapons to degrade Ukraine’s military infrastructure and protect its own security.
