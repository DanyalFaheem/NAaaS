0,"PFF election process to begin from next month, says NC chairman",Says first step will will be the registration of clubs from across the country through the FIFA-Connect ID system.,"LAHORE: The FIFA-appointed Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) Normalisation Committee chairman Haroon Malik on Saturday said that the process of holding elections of the country’s football governing body will start from next month with the first step being the registration of clubs from across the country through the FIFA-Connect ID system.
Haroon was addressing the first press conference by the NC since the near 15-month suspension on the PFF was lifted by FIFA last month, with the NC having been given a one-year extension to its mandate to put Pakistan football back on track with free and fair elections of the PFF, which has been embroiled in crisis since 2015.
“We have not fixed a date for the election just yet but the election process from district to the highest level will start from next month and would be completed according to the PFF constitution which allows a span of eight months to complete them,” Haroon told reporters.
“Once the club registration is completed, the process of scrutiny will begin through district-level tournaments. The Connect ID system will help prepare a transparent voting list of the clubs.”
Asked if he was going to call a meeting with the stakeholders to take them into confidence on the rules and regulations of the elections to ensure their smooth conduct in order to avoid any litigation, Haroon said: “Some people are coming and meeting the NC and a meeting with stakeholders could also be held.”
Pakistan was suspended by FIFA in April last year following a takeover of the PFF headquarters by a group of officials led by Ashfaq Hussain Shah. With NC out of office, it gave the government an eight-month roadmap to hold the elections once the suspension was lifted in order to gain back control of the PFF headquarters. 
Initially, the suspension was to be lifted when the NC had regained full control of all assets, including bank accounts. However, FIFA lifted the suspension despite a case regarding the accounts being heard in court as an alternate arrangement was made to receive funding from the global football body. 
The PFF headquarters were in dilapidated condition on Saturday with the press conference room lacking in many basic facilities.
“The conditions of the assets of the PFF like air conditioners, vehicles and of other office equipments is not in very good condition, the accounts of the NC are still frozen and although FIFA has decided to make alternate arrangements to provide funds to the NC, it has not yet started,” Haroon informed.
The PFF NC chief added that the national team will take part in next month’s SAFF Women’s Championship in Nepal and preparations for it will begin in due course.
Haroon became the NC chairman in January last year following the resignation of the previous chair has seen much of his tenure affected by the long suspension but said more good news for Pakistan’s football will come in the future.
“Players who had performed during the last edition of the National Women’s Championship [which was disrupted due to the takeover of the PFF headquarters] will be called for the trials to select the team,” said Haroon.
“Keeping in view the venue of the championship, the training camp would be held in a suitable city.”

1,Pakistan lose openers after Shaheen and company dismiss Sri Lanka for 222,GALLE: Pakistan’s Shaheen Shah Afridi led an inspired attack to bowl out Sri Lanka for 222 but the hosts hit back...,"GALLE: Pakistan’s Shaheen Shah Afridi led an inspired attack to bowl out Sri Lanka for 222 but the hosts hit back with two wickets before stumps on the opening day of the first Test here at the Galle International Stadium on Saturday.
The tourists reached 24 for two at the close of play after losing their openers Imam-ul-Haq and Abdullah Shafique.
Azhar Ali, on three, and skipper Babar Azam, on one, were batting at close of play with Pakistan still trailing by 198 runs.
Fast bowler Kasun Rajitha trapped Imam leg before wicket for two and Prabath Jayasuriya took down Abdullah for 13 with his left-arm spin on a day dominated by the bowlers.
Left-arm fast bowler Shaheen stood out with figures of 4-58 but Dinesh Chandimal’s attacking 76 and a late cameo of 36 by Maheesh Theekshana gave the hosts a fighting total on a pitch expected to aid spinners.

“That’s the beauty of Test cricket, sometimes tailenders and sometimes lower-order batsmen look like proper batsmen,” Shaheen told reporters.
“We to get them out under 150-160, but the last few batsmen played well. Chandimal played well.”
The hosts were tottering at 133-8 but added 89 runs for the final two wickets including a 44-run stand by Theekshana and Chandimal, who hit 10 fours and one six.
Shaheen wrapped up the innings with the wicket of Theekshana in the final session of play.
“They bowled really well,” said Chandimal.  “What we need to do is to get the positives from this innings and take it to the next innings.”Former captain Chandimal said early wickets will decide the course of the match on Sunday’s day two and a lead of about 40 can make the hosts gain more ground.
Shaheen struck in the third over of the day to send back skipper Dimuth Karunaratne for one, and leg-spinner Yasir Shah soon combined with the quick bowlers to have Sri Lanka in trouble after they elected to bat.
Oshada Fernando and Kusal Mendis attempted to rebuild the innings in a 49-run partnership but Yasir, who is making a comeback to the team after a thumb injury that kept him out since August last year, broke through.
Yasir got Kusal caught behind for 21 and Oshada soon followed his partner back to the pavilion in the next over when pace bowler Hasan Ali cut short the opener’s stay on 35.
Angelo Mathews then fell for a 15-ball duck as Yasir got the former captain caught at mid-on.
“He’s a very good bowler,” said Chandimal.  “We had a plan for him. We are not going to give him too much respect either.”
Shaheen struck twice after lunch and fellow quick Naseem Shah and left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz took a wicket each.
Chandimal smashed 19-year-old Naseem for three straight boundaries to bring up his fifty and offer some cheer to the weekend crowd.
Chandimal, who made an unbeaten 206 in Sri Lanka’s series-levelling Test win over Australia earlier this week, finally fell to a good catch by Yasir at cover with Ali taking his second wicket.
But Theekshana played a defiant knock in just his second Test and put on 45 runs for the last wicket with Rajitha, unbeaten on 12.
Meanwhile, the 32-year-old Chandimal credited  support from friends and family in helping him get back among the runs  after being in and out of the national side.
“You have  got to be mentally strong if you are playing Test cricket,” said  Chandimal, who averages more than 42 in 68 Tests.
“I have been out of the side at times. That makes me  stronger. You have to score runs to remain in the side. So I thought  about the technique and how to keep myself not distracted and grab the  opportunity when it came.”
Chandimal has had a rough time after being  sacked as Sri Lanka skipper in 2019 following his team’s thrashing in  Australia.
The senior batsman has since failed to secure a regular  place in the side in all formats, but his recent return to form has  allowed him to reflect on his struggles.
“You need help during  those tough times. I get a lot of support from my family, my wife,  coaches, team mates and my friends. I am glad I got that,” he said.
“When  you are down you need support like that. If people are criticising it’s  difficult. We don’t want to fail and we need support. Happy that I  contributed.”

2,Vingegaard holds off Pogacar in heated Tour de France duel,Overall leader Jonas Vingegaard tracked Tadej Pogacar’s attack all the way to the stage 14 finish line.,"MENDE: Overall leader Jonas Vingegaard tracked Tadej Pogacar’s attack all the way to the stage 14 finish line as the defending champion tried, but failed, to take time off his Danish rival on another tense, baking day at the Tour de France on Saturday.
Australian Michael Matthews won the stage, a sizzling 192km run south-west from Saint-Etienne, after a see-saw struggle with Italian rider Alberto Bettiol up the final hill.
After three days in the mountains and a tense struggle Friday, gathering fatigue was exacerbated as the road temperature hit 60C as the race entered rustic, hilly terrain with dry stone walls everywhere.
Only 40 kilometres in, Pogacar had tried an attack before Vingegaard’s Jumbo team reeled the Slovenian UAE man.
“It’s a race. I tried and I’ll keep doing that,” said Pogacar who remains 2min 22sec off Vingegaard.
“Pogacar got away early when I was dozing,” admitted the yellow jersey. “But my team pulled hard and got him back.”
The sweating peloton settled down as it raced along the narrow, roads packed with rowdy fans in otherwise empty countryside, Matthews and 20 other riders broke away.
The first time the 31-year-old Matthews tried to shake off his companions, he was reeled in and overtaken by Bettiol.
The inspired Australian rallied, caught Bettiol and left him trailing to take a fourth Tour de France stage win by a clear margin.
Matthews credited his wife for the tactics that broke a four year gap in wins on the Tour.
“My wife said ‘if you want to win try something different, something people don’t expect from you’,” he said.
“So that’s what I did. Hopefully today my wife and my daughter are proud of me,” said the BikeExchange rider.
“I wanted to show my daughter why I’m away so much and this is why we sacrifice so much.”
Some 10 minutes later, Pogacar attacked Vingegaard at the same place with his trademark kick on a steep climb 5km from the finish Vingegaard skipped up behind with ease and held on all the way to the line at the Mende Aerodrome even when the champion tried yet again to drop him.
The man in yellow then cruised alongside Pogacar and held him by the hand briefly.
Ineos pair Geraint Thomas and Adam Yates both dropped 20 seconds but remain third and fifth respectively at 2min 43 and 4min 06, respectively.
Frenchman Romain Bardet ended the day fourth overall at 3min 03sec in his home region, where banners bearing his name hung from buildings, walls and trees.
The searing heat made the tarmac soft on some corners and 2,000 litres of cold-water were poured onto the newer roads around 20 mins before the peloton passed.
“It was very hot, I guess 40C (the air), mainly in the closing section near Mende. But I don’t mind the heat, I cope quite well in it,” said Vingegaard.
Sunday’s stage to Carcassonne will see the heatwave peak before three days in the Pyrenees next week.
“I have a lot of respect for Tadej, but maybe now I’ll attack him,” said the Dane.

3,All matters resolved amicably in meeting with IPC minister: Khokhar,LAHORE: Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar on Saturday said all the...,"LAHORE: Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar on Saturday said all the matters with the Inter-provincial Coordination (IPC) Committee had been resolved amicably.
“I had a very good discussion with the federal IPC minister [Ehsan-ur-Rehman Mazari] and explained to him the situation in detail. All the issues have been resolved amicably,” Khokhar told Dawn on Saturday.
“It was a very good meeting [on Friday] and the minister was very kind to solve the matters amicably,” the PHF president added.
It may be mentioned here that in a sudden move on July 7, the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) had de-notified the PHF body citing the federation had failed to hold the elections due on May 14, 2022.
Subsequently, the PHF president wrote a letter to Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, who is also PHF patron-in-chief, to bring the entire situation into his notice. On Friday, a meeting with Federal IPC Minister Ehsan-ur-Rehman was held and the matter was resolved.
Asked if the PHF would now hold fresh elections, the PHF president said,”Of course, the elections are due and they will be held according to the PHF constitution.”
It  may be mentioned here that the PSB in its order issued in October last year had instructed all the national sports federations not to hold their elections till the implementation of the revised National Sports Policy 2005.
During this period, the due date for the PHF elections (May 14, 2022) passed. Later on June 10, the PSB through another letter allowed all the federations to hold their elections keeping in view their respective tenures.

4,Pakistan wants ICC to regulate growth of T20 leagues,"The growth of franchise cricket is impacting the already-crammed international cricket calendar, PCB's Faisal Hasnain says.","KARACHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday said that it has asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to devise a way to regulate the growth of lucrative Twenty20 leagues with rising concerns about its impact on the sport’s calendar.
South Africa this week pulled out of a three-match bilateral ODI series in Australia in January as it clashes with their new domestic T20 competition.
The next cycle of the FTP is set to be confirmed later this month at the annual conference of the ICC in Birmingham.
“The growth of franchise cricket is impacting the already-crammed international cricket calendar,” PCB chief executive Faisal Hasnain said in a statement.  “The PCB is concerned about this development and wants the ICC to formulate a strategy on this issue.
“We have sent a proposal to the ICC, which they have added to their meeting agenda. Two other boards have also conveyed their apprehensions to the ICC on this matter and urged the ICC to create a working group to debate on the expansion of franchise-based T20 leagues.
“Finalising the FTP is very important for us.
“This will give us certainty about which teams will be visiting us and which countries we will be touring. Eighty percent of the FTP has already been agreed upon and the remaining 20% will be completed in the upcoming meeting.”

5,Cameron Smith defends overnight lead in British Open third round,Smith is aiming to become the first Australian to win the Claret Jug since Greg Norman triumphed at Royal St George’s in 1993.,"

ST ANDREWS: Cameron Smith teed off in the third round of the 150th British Open in splendid sunshine at St Andrews on Saturday with the Australian defending his overnight lead after sitting at 13 under par at the halfway stage while some of golf’s biggest names lurked just behind.
Smith, the world number six with the trademark mullet, followed an opening 67 with an eight-under-par second round of 64 on Friday to lead by two strokes from Cameron Young, the 25-year-old New Yorker who sat at 11-under.
However, Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson and world number one Scottie Scheffler all ended the second round in a position to challenge for the Claret Jug over the weekend.
The leading contenders returned to the Old Course on Saturday afternoon with Smith and Young going out as the final pairing at 3:55pm (1455 GMT).
Brisbane-native Smith’s halfway total of 131 was the lowest ever 36-hole score in an Open at St Andrews, but he began his third round with a bogey at the first hole.
Smith, who finished tied second behind Johnson in the Masters in 2020, is aiming to become the first Australian to win the Claret Jug since Greg Norman triumphed at Royal St George’s in 1993.
Norman, who won the Open twice and is now the figurehead of LIV Golf, was not invited by the organisers to attend a series of events for past champions in St Andrews this week because of his connection to the breakaway Saudi-backed series.
Young, who led after the first round having opened with a 64 and followed that with a 69 on Friday, is appearing at his first British Open but finished tied third in the PGA Championship at Southern Hills in May.
However, there is a sense in St Andrews that the main threat to Smith may come from McIlroy, who built on his opening 66 with a 68 on Friday to sit on 10-under, level in third place at the halfway stage with Viktor Hovland.
“I know I’ve got the game. That’s all I need. I just need to go out and play my game and play my golf over the next two days and that’s all I can do,” said McIlroy, who is looking to claim a second Claret Jug following his 2014 victory at Hoylake.
McIlroy went out alongside Hovland, Norway’s world number nine, in the penultimate pairing of the day.
Former world number one Johnson, who quit the PGA Tour last month to join the LIV series, sat at nine-under overnight as he went out with Scheffler.
Johnson, the two-time major winner, is hoping to avoid any repeat of the last Open at St Andrews in 2015, when he led at the halfway stage on 10-under but a third-round 75 ended his hopes.Masters champion Scheffler and England’s Tyrrell Hatton were both eight-under at the halfway stage.
However, England’s Tommy Fleetwood — the runner-up at Royal Portrush in 2019 — moved onto nine-under overall after a superb six-under-par round of 66 on Saturday.
Earlier, Kevin Kisner recorded a 65 after beginning the day at level-par for the championship.
The American, who came tied second in 2018 at Carnoustie, at one point looked poised to at least equal the lowest score in an Open at St Andrews of 63 as he birdied seven of his first 10 holes.
He had nine birdies altogether, but two bogeys on the inward nine blemished his card.
Thomas Pieters is also at seven-under for the championship after a 67 with the Belgian one of several players to make an eagle at the par-four ninth on Saturday.
Tiger Woods missed the cut in what could be his final appearance here after rounds of 78 and 75 left him at nine-over.
Last year’s champion Collin Morikawa, at one-over, also missed the cut mark of even par.

Was it the perfect swansong for Felix? Not quite, as she and Kennedy Simon were both reeled in on their respective legs, leaving the Dominican Republic to take victory in the 4x400m mixed relay, the Dutch quartet edging the US for silver.
Her bronze is Felix’s 19th at world champs in a career that started almost two decades ago and also included 11 Olympic medals.
“It was very special to be able to run in front of a home crowd for my last race,” said Felix.
“It was so cool. My daughter was in the stands. It was a night I will cherish.”
Felix added:  “I’ve had such good memories. I know it is time and these guys will carry it on into the future.
“I am at peace stepping into this next stage and have tremendous gratitude for this sport.”
In-form Kerley ran a sensational heat-winning 9.79 seconds in a warning to potential rivals for the 100m crown.
He advanced to the semi-finals along with team-mates Marvin Bracey, Trayvon Bromell and defending champion Christian Coleman, who missed the Tokyo Olympics after missing three doping tests.
Reigning Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs, a shock winner in Tokyo who has struggled with injury this season, acknowledged that he had struggled in his heat.
“I am not at my 100%,” the Italian said.  “Running 10.04 at half capacity of what I can run, I can say my physical shape is fine. I just need to get my legs ready.” 
There was a historic first ever world medal for Peru as Kimberly Garcia Leon won the women’s 20km race walk, the first medal event at the Eugene worlds.
The second medal event of the champs saw Toshikazu Yamanishi produce a brutal final kick to defend his world men’s 20km race walk title.
In a Japanese 1-2, compatriot Koki Ikeda took silver, seven seconds off the winning pace, in a repeat of the result at March’s World Race Walking Team Championships in Muscat.
Home hopes of gold in the men’s shot put were kept alive as world record holder Crouser qualified for Sunday’s final with a 22.28m effort.
Dutch distance sensation Sifan Hassan is defending champion in the women’s 1,500m, but she has opted out of defending her title in Eugene.
She will instead concentrate on the 5,000-10,000m double, which she pulled off at last year’s Tokyo Olympics.
Hassan also won bronze in the 1,500m in the Japanese capital, a race won by Kenya’s Faith Kipyegon ahead of Briton Laura Muir.
Both Kipyegon and Muir qualified smoothly for the semi-final, with the final scheduled for Monday.

BERLIN: Poland striker Robert Lewandowski is set ...","Lewandowski set to join Barca after verbal agreement with Bayern
BERLIN: Poland striker Robert Lewandowski is set to join Barcelona after Bayern Munich reached a verbal agreement with the La Liga side on a transfer, the Bundesliga champions said on Saturday.
The 33-year-old has 12 months remaining on his Bayern contract and multiple media reports had said he was expected to sign a three-year deal with the 26-times Spanish champions.
“We have come to a verbal agreement with Barcelona,” Bayern president Herbert Hainer said in a statement.
“It’s good to have clarity for all parties. Robert is an incredible player and he won everything with us. We are incredibly grateful to him.”  Spanish media reported that Barcelona would pay around 45 million euros ($45.4 million) plus another 5 million in add-ons for the striker.
Lewandowski joined Bayern in 2014 from Borussia Dortmund and has won the Bundesliga every year since then, as well as the Champions League in 2020.
Named FIFA Best Men’s Player for the second straight year in January, Lewandowski said in May that his story with Bayern was over and he could not imagine staying on with the German champions.
The club were not eager to let the Bundesliga’s second-highest all-time scorer go, but Bayern sports director Hasan Salihamidzic had confirmed Lewandowski did not accept an offer to extend his contract and was looking for new experience elsewhere.
Bayern also announced that German international Serge Gnabry, who had been linked by the British media with a return to the Premier League, had extended his contract until 2026.—Reuters
Chelsea sign Senegal defender Koulibaly from Napoli
LONDON: Chelsea have completed the signing of Senegal defender Kalidou Koulibaly from Napoli on a four-year contract, the Premier League club said on Saturday.
British media reported Chelsea paid a fee in the region of 32 million pounds ($38 million) for Koulibaly, who becomes the London side’s second summer signing since the Todd Boehly-led takeover after Raheem Sterling’s arrival on Wednesday.
“I’m very happy to be here with this team at Chelsea,” Koulibaly said in a statement.  “It’s a big team in the world and my dream was always to play in the Premier League.
“Chelsea came first to get me in 2016 but we didn’t make it. Now when they came to me I accepted it because they really wanted me to come to the Premier League to play for them.”  Chelsea lost centre backs Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen earlier in the close season, and Koulibaly’s addition will come as a boost for Thomas Tuchel’s side as they look to close the gap on Manchester City and Liverpool.
Koulibaly made 317 appearances for Napoli after joining from Belgian club Genk in 2014, winning two trophies and cementing his place among some of the top defenders in Italy.—Reuters

The races are resuming after a fortnight after they were cancelled last week due to heavy rains in the metropolis.
If one goes by the present form, chestnut mare Sweet Golden has a bright chance to stretch her winning run to seven by capturing the Monsoon Cup which is the last race of a five-race card under combined scale order II, III and IV which will go over four-and-a-half furlongs.
Sweet Golden had completed a double hat-trick winning her last outing on July 3 and she may enter her name in the annals of the equine sport if she repeats her winning run.
She is expected to be chased by bay horses Shahbaz and Fabulous. However, if on job, mare Jugni can upset the race.
Bay horse Thunder Strike looks poised to complete a hat-trick by winning the fourth and supporting race under scale order V and VI which too has seven acceptors and will take place over four furlongs.
There seems to be a three-way tie for second place between Zahrish, Marvellous and New Market.
Mare Stayin’ Alive is expected to make amends by winning the opening race under scale order VIII that will see seven horses vying for honours over four furlongs.
She may be followed by mare Sheba. Mare Meri Chahat, if backed by connection, may create a stir.
Bay horses Daffodles Wave and Deewana are likely to dominate the second and third races, respectively. The former may be followed by Non Stop while the latter may be challenged by Club Champion. Both races will go over four furlongs.
The first race starts at 3:30pm.

The races will be held in ideal underfoot conditions at the velvet green soft turf following a rainy spell in Lahore this week.
The Eid Cup, a Class VII Division I handicap race to be contested over 1,000 metres, has eight runners. The beauty of this race is that at least half-a-dozen runners are on chance, so the rider’s skill and the fitness of his mount will be the crucial factors.
The race, which will be fourth of the day, should end in a close finish. 
The main supporting event, the Sawan Plate Class VII Division I and II combined handicap race  to be gone over 100 metres has seven runners. On classification, colt Lucky Sohna looks a cut above the class in spite of his placing on the top of handicap figures at 9 stones 2 pounds on his back. But the question remains whether it has the approval of stable runners.
Filly Queen’s Gambit and Gul-e-Mesam could be his close rivals.
The second supporting event, the Sawan Plate Class VII Division III and IV to be gone over 1,000 metres, has six runners. In this race, the owner of three-year-old gelding Sehar has filed an appeal against its handicapping on top weight with nine stones. The gelding looks to be slightly punished in the handicap figures after his placing second in the previous outing.
In a tight handicap race even a couple of pounds disadvantage can alter a horse’s performance. The administrators will decide the matter before the race. Anyway, this should be a good contest.
Hard Target in the opener looks better placed in the handicap to get advantage over his rivals. 
The first race starts at 6:00pm.

The Black Caps looked on course for a convincing win after Martin Guptill’s century laid the foundations for a total of 360 for six from 50 overs.
Stirling and Tector made the tourists sweat with some superb stroke-play in a tense finish.
Ireland’s lower order managed to bring the chase down to 10 off the last over. They scored five off Blair Tickner’s first three balls, then Craig Young was run out trying for a second run.
Graham Hume needed three off the last ball, but his huge swing missed.
Ireland got only a leg bye and, despite their highest ever ODI score of 359 for nine, suffered their third narrow loss of the series.
New Zealand won the first match by one wicket with one ball to spare and the second by three wickets to set up the sweep.
Guptill hit a faultless 115, his 18th ODI century for New Zealand, and Henry Nicholls smashed three sixes in his 54-ball 79.
When Ireland batted, Stirling reached three figures with a boundary down to third man but was furious when he was out for 120, one of Matt Henry’s four victims.
His 179-run partnership for the third-wicket with Tector, who had made 113 in the series opener, was an Irish ODI record.
When Tector went for 108, the hosts’ hopes of victory looked slim, but George Dockrell’s rapid 22 kept them in the fight to the end.
