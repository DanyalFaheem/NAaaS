• Punjab govt arrests alleged PTI worker for ‘buying votes’ 
• Army to act as ‘Quick Reaction Force’ in case of law, order situation
LAHORE: The Sharifs’ Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) are both bracing for a high-stakes provincial assembly election on 20 seats on Sunday (today), as political pundits declare the contest a matter of ‘life and death’ for both major competitors who practically have their political futures in the province on the line.
Law enforcement agencies, including the army, have been placed on alert to avert any violence, especially in five of the 20 constituencies — four in Lahore and one in Multan.
Read: Punjab by-polls: Country’s ‘political heart’ weighed down by apathy
If the opposition PTI manages to grab majority seats, it could dethrone Hamza Shehbaz as the Punjab chief minister, which the Sharifs, especially Hamza’s father Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, cannot afford, as it could restrict the junior Sharif’s rule to the Centre only.
The Sharifs also know the PTI-PML-Q joint candidate for the highest office in the province, Parvez Elahi, would prove to be a nightmare for the PML-N in Punjab and may conquer their ‘citadel’ in alliance with Mr Khan in the next general elections. Therefore, the ruling party would have had sleepless nights on Saturday, marshalling its troops and urging them not to rest until every last voter got out of his/her house and headed to the polling stations today.
For the PTI, today’s by-polls mean a lot more than defeating the Sharifs and Zardaris. Imran Khan and his companions have painted the contest as ‘a fight between good (his party) and evil (the ruling coalitions in the Centre and Punjab)’ and a matter of the country’s sovereignty in the face of alleged foreign meddling in its affairs. The former premier has alerted his party’s Tiger Force to ‘stand guard’ at all polling stations to thwart any rigging attempts by the PML-N.
In a late night development, PML-N MPA Mian Jalil Sharaqpuri submitted his resignation to speaker Pervez Elahi. His resignation came a day after another PML-N MPA, Faisal Niazi of Khanewal, quit his seat.
The PML-N-led coalition now needs at least 11 seats to achieve the 186-member majority in the assembly for Hamza to survive as the CM, whereas Mr Elahi requires 13 to add to his tally of 173 in the house in order to oust the junior Sharif.
Explainer: Why the by-polls in Punjab are so important
The Punjab Assembly currently stands at 350 members: the PTI has 163 lawmakers and its ally PML-Q 10. The PML-N has 164 members in the house, while its coalition partners PPP seven, four independents and one Rah-i-Haq Party. Disgruntled PML-N stalwart, MPA Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, has reportedly refused to cast his vote in favour of either candidate for the CM’s post.
A party source told Dawn that more surprises may be in store for Hamza Shehbaz, in the shape of resignations by rebel MPAs if the results of the by-polls put both parties in an evenly poised position.
The polling on 20 of the 25 vacated seats (five reserved) is being held after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) deseated defecting PTI lawmakers for voting for Hamza in the Punjab chief minister’s election in April. The run-off election for the office would be held on July 22 on the directions of the Supreme Court. 
On Saturday, both rivals traded allegations of rigging with each other. The PTI leadership accuses the government of using state machinery to influence the election. It also alleges the ECP has colluded with the PML-N to rig the by-polls, citing a supposed change in voters lists as proof. The ECP, however, denies the allegations.
Ousted premier and PTI chief Imran Khan believes the PML-N, the ECP and some ‘hidden hands’ have ganged up against him to rig Sunday’s polls. “This is a message to my team when they contest the Punjab by-elections on Sunday against PMLN, the state machinery, the biased Election Commission plus Mr X and Mr Y (a reference to hidden hands).”
Khan said all “turncoats” (the 20 ex-PTI lawmakers contesting on PML-N tickets now) would see themselves “thrashed with the bat (PTI election symbol)”. He also urged the people of Punjab to “foil the plot of rigging designed by Hamza Shehbaz” on Sunday.
The opposition, especially the PTI and Mr Khan, has for weeks been urging the establishment to stay neutral, and not play any role in politics in favour of any party.
PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz called the polls “not a selection but an election”. She remarked that rigging was in the DNA of the PTI, citing the Daska by-polls. 
CM Hamza also presented his two cents, saying people would reject the “fraud narrative and false slogan of Imran Khan” with the power of their vote. He directed the administration and police to ensure the security of voters. “Miscreants will not be allowed to spoil the environment during the polling day,” he warned.
Arrests over ‘vote buying’, entering Punjab
Meanwhile, in a tacit declaration it was serious about not sparing its opponents, the Punjab government arrested a man, identified as Khalid Husain, from Lahore’s PP-168 constituency on charges of vote buying. The Hamza administration claimed the suspect belonged to the PTI and had bought over 7,000 votes at the behest of PTI leader Farrukh Habib. The former state minister called the episode “usual” maligning tactics of the PML-N. “It is the PML-N that is good at buying votes and not the PTI,” he asserted.
Moreover, the Lahore police escorted PTI leader Maqbool Gujjar out of the city for violating a ban on his entry into Punjab. The PML-N government had barred Gujjar and former federal minister Ali Amin Gandapur from entering the province till a day after the polls.
Justifying the ban, Punjab home minister Attaullah Tarar said it had been imposed in anticipation that “armed groups may enter Punjab along with [the leaders] from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Azad Jammu and Kashmir to disrupt law and order during the by-polls”.  
Meanwhile, ISPR announced on Saturday that army troops would act as Quick Reaction Force in case of any law and order situation arising during the by-elections.

2,"Democracy requires moral, not military strength: Imran","PTI chief says gulf between people, army will only weaken the institution.","• PTI chief urges generals to take ‘U-turn’ on support for PML-N govt 
• Says gulf between people, army will only weaken the institution 
• Claims he never ordered journalists’ abduction, curbs on media
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Saturday deplored the imbalance in civil-military relations, as he blamed previous PPP and PML-N governments for ceding space to the army to ‘save their skin’ in corruption cases.
The former prime minister made these remarks at a seminar on freedom of expression, a day ahead of crucial by-polls in Punjab, where his party is contesting on 20 Punjab Assembly seats across the province.
“Because of this imbalance, a situation has developed that [now] the establishment isn’t realising [the consequences of] the actions it is committing,” he said, while referring to a crackdown against his party following his ouster as a result of the no-confidence motion.

“We cannot afford a weak army... we have to protect it. If the distance between the army and the public keeps increasing, which it is, then it will eventually harm the army and Pakistan.” 
According to Mr Khan, democracy depended on “moral strength” and not physical strength, which he said the Pakistani military possesses.
‘Take a U-turn’
The PTI chief also urged the establishment to take a U-turn on its support for the incumbent government. He said that Pakistan stood at a critical juncture and it was very important that the “right decisions” were made today. 
Mr Khan said that reinforcing a “failed” government would further widen the gulf between the people and the establishment. He, however, added that the establishment should differentiate between constructive and damaging criticism.
The PTI chairman questioned whether the decision taken by the military establishment behind “closed doors” to support the incumbent regime was beneficial to Pakistan. “Who told them that the decision [to back PML-N] was a better option?” Mr Khan said that “U-turns are even important for generals” as no one could be absolutely right.
“The nation is looking towards the establishment because they have the power,” Mr Khan claimed and warned that the current set-up would destabilise Pakistan politically and economically.  
‘Missing persons’ 
The former prime minister also spoke about enforced disappearances and a clampdown on journalists under his regime and said that his government had nothing to do with whisking people away or restrictions on media.
“I was never afraid of media… [I] was the most criticised PM… [yet] I never tried to bribe journalists or take action against them,” the ex-PM added. He said “constructive criticism” was necessary.
“The trend of disappearing people started during the War on Terror. I was the first person to protest against this practice in 2003 after Aafia Siddiqui went missing. I did not know the point of view of the army till I came into power,” Mr Khan said, adding that he used to speak against these enforced disappearances because “there is nothing more painful” than seeing the relatives of missing persons coming to ask about their loved ones.
“We came in the government and got to know that often times people were picked up on [the pretext of] national security.” 
Mr Khan said he spoke to Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa when Gen Faiz Hamid was the chief of the ISI, which resulted in the release of many forcibly disappeared people. 
“They [army] said the problem was regarding the judiciary,” he said, adding that the explanation provided to him was that it was difficult to prosecute a terrorist in court due to a lack of evidence or witnesses.
Nonetheless, he said, an agreement was reached and his government was working on a bill that would have, at least, kept the families of the missing persons in the loop. 
Imran Khan also distanced his government from the abduction of journalists during the rule of the PTI government. “Shireen [Mazari] knows, it came up in cabinet three or four times that some journalist was picked up; no journalist was picked up on my instructions, [as] the problem was something else,” Mr Khan added. 
‘Vile campaigns by PTI’
Disputing Mr Khan’s stance that there were no restrictions on the press during his tenure, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said there are reports about restrictions placed on press during the PTI era, adding that vile campaigns were launched on social media against journalists.
“Imran Khan is saying that during my government media was free, there was no restriction or censorship on the media,” she said while showing various clippings regarding censorship during the government of the PTI. These included reports by Reporters Without Borders, Human Rights Watch, and the Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE). 
She also mentioned cases of online harassment, kidnappings and threats faced by media persons, including women journalists and restrictions on electronic and print media during the previous government. 
Separately, former president and PPP leader Asif Zardari also reacted to Mr Khan’s statements.
In a statement, he said that Imran Khan should have realised the importance of a free press while he was ruling the country and termed the PTI government “the blackest phase” for press freedom in the country’s history Kalbe Ali in Islamabad also contributed to this report

3,FATF’s on-site visit likely in September,"The visit will also pave the way for friendly countries strengthening economic, trade and investment relations with Pakistan.","ISLAMABAD: Global financial crime watchdog the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) will send its on-site mission to Pakistan sometime in September, a visit anticipated by diplomatic circles in Islamabad as a “final walk-through from the FATF process” for the country.
Though the date of the mission’s visit to Islamabad is being finalised through diplomatic channels, diplomatic circles believe it would take place in the early fall.
At its last month’s plenary in Berlin, the FATF made the initial determination that Pakistan had substantially completed its two action plans covering 34 items. It will now make an on-site visit to verify that the implementation of Pakistan’s anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) has begun and is sustained and that the necessary political commitment remains in place to sustain implementation and improvement in the future.
The diplomatic circles believe that Pakistan’s moving from the grey list to the white list of the FATF will help develop a new synergy and the international financial institutions will be able to help the government in overcoming economic and financial crunch.
In its annual report for 2020-21, the FATF noted that Pakistan had made significant progress in strengthening counterterrorism financing measures, as per its original action plan.
The FATF also worked with Pakistan to develop a new action plan, which includes demonstrating that financial supervisors conduct on-site and off-site checks on non-financial sector businesses and demonstrating an increase in money laundering investigations and prosecutions, including cases of overseas financing.
The walk-through from the FATF will also pave the way for friendly countries, further strengthening economic, trade and investment relations with Pakistan, particularly the western European countries.
Pakistan is also looking to expand bilateral economic relations with the United States, and it has been learnt that the Biden administration has identified six key areas to help Pakistan, including trade, investment, energy, water, climate change and education sectors.
From Washington on Friday, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai held a virtual meeting with Commerce Minister Syed Naveed Qamar to discuss matters for promoting US-Pakistan trade and investment relations.
Pakistan is currently the 56th largest goods trading partner of the United States, with two-way trade amounting to around $6.6 billion in 2019, according to US trade office statistics. Of that, US exports totalled $2.6bn while imports stood at $3.9bn, meaning the United States was in a deficit of 1.3bn.
The United States considers that there is no threat to food security in Pakistan. However, it wants to explore new ways and means to help the country in the agricultural sector, particularly in research for developing new varieties of major crops.
US State Department’s Special Representative for Commercial and Business Affairs Dilawar Syed visited Pakistan early this month and assured Islamabad that US companies could introduce new technologies and generate returns that would translate into higher incomes for local workers and capital for additional investments.
He said the US government was exploring concrete ways to build on that relationship to benefit both the countries against the backdrop of trade and investment cooperation that was an ongoing and essential part of the bilateral relationship.

4,Eyeing $4bn from friendly countries this month,"Miftah expects $3.5bn from ADB, $2.5bn from World Bank and $400-500m from AIIB in current fiscal year.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is likely to get $4 billion from friendly countries this month to bridge a gap in foreign reserves highlighted by the International Monetary Fund, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said, two days after sealing a deal with the lender.
The IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on Thursday that would pave the way for a disbursement of $1.18bn. The board is also considering adding $1bn to a $6bn programme agreed in 2019.
“As per the IMF, there is a $4bn gap,” Mr Ismail told a news conference in Islamabad, referring to the shortfall in foreign reserves.
“We will, God willing, fill this gap in the month of July,” he said. “We think that we will get $1.2bn in deferred oil payment from a friendly country. We think that a foreign country will invest between $1.5bn to $2bn in stocks on a G2G (government-to-government) basis, and another friendly country will perhaps give us gas on deferred payment and yet another friendly country will make some deposits.”

Miftah expects $3.5bn from ADB, $2.5bn from World Bank and $400-500m from AIIB in current fiscal year

Depleting reserves, a widening current account deficit and the rupee’s depreciation against the dollar have left the nation facing a balance-of-payments crisis.
Without the IMF deal, which should open up other avenues for external finance, Mr Ismail said the country could have headed towards default.
He said the country would also get around $6bn from multilateral lenders this fiscal year, including $3.5bn from the Asian Development Bank and $2.5bn from the World Bank.
He said $400m to $500m was also expected from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank while the Islamic Development Bank was also likely to increase the funding.
‘Unpopular decisions’
The current government had to take tough and unpopular decisions to avert default, Mr Ismail said, blaming the previous administration for all the economic woes faced by the country.
He hoped the rupee would strengthen against the dollar soon after the IMF agreement was finalised, which was expected in the current month. Besides, he said the government was aiming to curb energy imports to $2.7bn this month from $3.7bn last month, which was also expected to take some pressure off the local currency.
However, he stressed that adhering to strict fiscal and financial discipline was vital to put the economy on a fast track, have sustainable economic development and attain social prosperity.
The press conference was heavily tilted towards criticising the “mismanagement and bad governance” of the previous PTI-led government, which Mr Ismail said was incapable and inefficient and pushed the country on the verge of economic default.
During the first three years of the PTI government, the budget deficit hit a historically high level of Rs3.41 trillion compared to Rs1.66tr during PML-N’s five-year tenure from 2013 to 2018.
Net debt and liabilities grew 78pc during the first three years of the PTI government to Rs53.54tr from Rs23.67tr, he said, adding that the country witnessed historic high deficits and a free fall of the rupee.
The tax-to-GDP ratio came down to 9pc according to new GDP, he said, adding that the PML-N government had left the ratio at 11pc.
He said that delay in decision-making, poor commitments with international lending institutions, particularly with the IMF, also proved disastrous for the national economy and pushed it to the verge of default.
Mr Ismail told reporters that foreign debts and liabilities increased from 33pc to 40pc and debt servicing more than doubled from Rs1.5tr to Rs3.14tr.
In budget 2022-23, the government had fixed revenue collection targets at Rs7.47tr, he said, adding that non-revenue collection was targeted at Rs1.94tr, which not only would be achieved but also surpassed.
Despite the tough fiscal position, he said the government raised its budgetary allocation of the Benazir Income Supports Programme from Rs250bn to Rs364bn.
Replying to a question, the minister said interest-free loans would be provided to youth besides promoting the IT sector, adding that the government had also provided Rs109bn for the higher education commission and allocated Rs5bn for the scholarship of the students from Balochistan.
