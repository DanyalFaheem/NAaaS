4,PTI leader barred from staying in Lahore,The Punjab government had barred Maqbool Gujjar and Ali Amin Gandapur from entering the province.,"LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Maqbool Gujjar was escorted out of Lahore for violating a ban placed on his entry here on Saturday.  
The Punjab government had barred PTI leaders Ali Amin Gandapur and Gujjar, Azad Kashmir Assembly member, from entering the province over a concern that they might cause unrest during by-elections on July 17 (Sunday).
DIG Operations Sohail Chaudhry told media that the AJK lawmaker was in Lahore despite a ban on him due to the by-polls.  
According to the government’s notice, PTI leaders are barred from entering Punjab from July 15 to 18 but Gujjar entered Lahore on Saturday and he was arrested and later escorted out of the city on a government order. Punjab Home Minister Ataullah Tarrar released a video statement and said Gujjar and Gandapur were trying to enter Punjab despite being barred, showing their “nefarious intentions”. 
“The PTI leaders trying to enter Punjab have revealed their bad intentions,” said Tarar, adding that it was feared that armed groups from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would enter Punjab. 
“Their intention was to spread violence during the by-elections. No one carrying arms will be allowed to enter the province under any circumstances,” he added. 
The home minister said it’s Punjab government’s responsibility to maintain law and order situation during the elections. “Punjab Police, Rangers and other law-enforcement agencies will strictly stop those trying to disrupt peace,” he added. 
Former Punjab chief minister Usman Buzdar reacted to the ban on Gujjar and Gandapur and said no province could close its borders on the citizens belonging to other regions. He said the Supreme Court should take immediate action against this “violation” of the Constitution. 
“The government has turned a blind eye to this whole situation,” added Buzdar. 
The former CM said hate against people based on language was growing in the country once again.

6,Fawad doesn’t see end to political crisis after by-polls,Accuses ECP of working as PML-N wing; Tarin advocates charter of economy after general election.,"LAHORE: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf ‘s former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry alleges that the Election Commission of Pakistan is working as a ‘PML-N wing’ to ensure rigging and adds that no action is being taken though the party has submitted constituency-wise complaints.
Speaking at a press conference flanked by former ministers Shaukat Tarin and Hammad Azhar and Sentaor Ejaz Chaudhry here on Saturday, Mr Chaudhry said the ECP delayed notification of five reserved seats MPAs for one month so that Hamza Shehbaz could sail smooth for the chief minister slot.
He said the ECP denied deputing polling agents from different constituencies and eventually the Lahore High Court allowed it. Still, he said, the ECP was not allowing [it] and committing contempt of court.
Mr Chaudhry alleged the police were harassing and arresting PTI workers.

Accuses ECP of working as PML-N wing; Tarin advocates charter of economy after general election

The former federal minister said the PTI was now riding a popular wave and would win at least 16 seats and topple the Hamza government.
When asked whether the political crisis would end if the PTI would win most seats in by-elections, Mr Chaudhry said the political crisis would not end even if Chaudhry Parvez Elahi became the chief minister. “The crisis will end only when the general elections will be held,” he added.
PTI central Punjab general secretary Hammad Azhar said the masses would take revenge of regime change by polling votes for “bat” on Sunday (today). He lamented that Aleem Khan and Asad Khokhar had yet again started the “money-politics” in Lahore, which had been eliminated after a lot of struggle. Senator Ejaz Chaudhry said the existing voter lists were replete with mistakes.
Former federal minister Shaukat Tarin chided finance minister Miftah Ismail for misquoting figures to fool masses. He said Miftah had himself signed the Economic Survey of Pakistan that explained there was highest 5.4 per cent and 6pc growth in economy during the last two years of the PTI government.
Owing to failed policies of the PML-N government, Mr Tarin regretted that it took the inflation rate to 33pc in three months and added that it would touch 40pc when the gas and power bills would be issued posting 45pc and 47pc increase.
Answering a question, he said, the new government and opposition after general elections should go for charter of economy.
Meanwhile, addressing a press conference at his house in Multan, PTI vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi said it is the  responsibility of ECP to ensure fair, free and peaceful by-election in Punjab. “The  democratic system will collapse if anyone tried to rig the election.”
He also appealed to the PTI workers to remain  peaceful during the conduct of election on Sunday (today) and said ECP should play its role in maintaining  law and order.
He said former  minister Abid Sher Ali, who belonged to Faisalabad, had been in Multan  for one and a half months and [allegedly] using state machinery to rig the  election. He said that they would not challenge the deployment of Rangers  in election but the presence of Abid Sher Ali and interior minister  Rana Sanaullah is questionable as the Rangers fall within the purview of the interior ministry.
Mr Qureshi said former prime  minister Yousuf Raza Gilani was also supporting his political  opponent Salman Naeem.  
“I would not have raised the issue had Mr Gilani canvassed for my son,” he said.
PTI central Punjab president Dr Yasmin Rashid said the PML-N had seen its defeat a writing on the wall and begun arresting PTI workers and particularly condemned the arrest of Khalid Sindhu.
Dr Rashid said the police tortured Sindhu, registered fake cases and kept him in illegal confinement to implicate him in a case of buying votes.
In a video message, Dr Rashid said all workers and voters should come out early and vote for “bat” to defeat the turncoats, who insulted their voters.
Parvez and Qaiser: National Assembly’s former speaker Asad Qaiser and Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi have said the turncoats in the upcoming by-elections will face a crushing defeat as all “rigging plans” will be resisted.
It was stated when Mr Qaiser called on Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and former federal minister Moonis Elahi here on Saturday.  
MNAs Hussain Elahi, Mahboob Shah, Humayun Khan, MPA Asif Nakai and others were present in the meeting that discussed Sunday’s by-elections and the political situation in Punjab.
Mr Elahi said July 17 would be the day of “victory of truth” and turncoats as well as bogus rulers would be sent packing. Now, he said, people had woken up and they could not be misled by fake announcements and gimmicks.  
“Today is our test and even a tougher and bigger test for Election Commission as how it proves its impartiality,” he said and added that the ECP had a golden opportunity to prove its impartiality and wash away its past wrongdoings.  
“We are forewarning the Election Commission [and asking it] to play its role according to the Constitution,” he added.
Mr Elahi said the PTI and PML-Q workers were on guard to stop rigging and added that the international media was not only keeping a close eye on the circumstances but its presence would also be seen at all polling stations.
Asad Qaiser said the decision of the people of Punjab on July 17 would be in favour of the PTI and added that Imran Khan’s successful rallies were a referendum against the rulers and the people of the province were ready to get rid of the “imported government”.

8,harking back: A view of the ‘ancient’ city as it changes,"To truly understand the working of ancient, and old, Lahore, it might be a useful exercise to walk through two lanes...","To truly understand the working of ancient, and old, Lahore, it might be a useful exercise to walk through two lanes – galis – and have a view of the place and the people present and past.  
But first just why has the old walled city been classified as ‘ancient’ and ‘old’? It’s really very simple. The original ancient walled city is well over 4,000 years old, and is located on a series of mounds. The fort nearby was similarly located. Around both the river Ravi once flowed and then moved on from the south-western edge to join the main river by passing by where today is Santnagar.  
In days of old there were just three main gates and they all had drawbridges, traces of which no longer exist. The ancient people, all Hindus, cremated their dead outside Mori Gate. In fact, the Hindu Shahi ruler Raja Jayapala was also cremated there. He was a proud Rajput who committed ‘Johar’ after three defeats at the hands of the Afghan invader Mahmud.  
Over time as the river meandered westwards the river outside the city walls also moved away. Then came the Mughal emperor Akbar, who made use of starving local people suffering from a famine caused primarily by his high taxes, to make bricks and build the wall. Dullah Bhatti was a product of those taxes. This gave the ‘old’ city its present wall alignment. Tragically, today nothing of the wall exists and no effort has been made to rebuild it. But that is another story.  
Now let us walk through two lanes in the ancient city. This space is between the eastern alignment of Bhati Gate Bazaar and the western alignment of Shahalami Bazaar. They meet at Chuna Mandi. That was the ‘ancient’ original walled city with mud walls.  
If you enter Mori Gate and walk through its main bazaar, you will reach a crossroad, and just head towards Said Metha Bazaar. Also once you enter Lohari Gate Bazaar you head eastwards and reach Gali Pir Bhola. Now we will walk through both these streets and will recall, as my late father narrated to me over 55 years ago, the people who lived there and where they came from.  
First Mori Gate and Said Metha Bazaar. In this bazaar lived for a short period the great classical singer Bare Ghulam Ali Khan. He had moved in from Kasur and this provided him access to the nearby music quarters in Taxali. He also had two ‘baithaks’ in Taxali and one outside on Bansaanwala Bazaar. The latter was, allegedly, where the great Tan Sain lived. Today outside a stinking mini tannery exists.  
Two houses away from this house in Said Metha lived the famous write Rajinder Singh Bedi. His family later moved to a larger house outside the city, for his father worked in the Lahore post office. For that matter initially so did Rajinder Singh Bedi. He was a great friend of my late father so when we visited, neighbours remarked: “You have come after a long time”. I remember his response: “Bedi has moved so have we friends. When the Guru moves his ‘chellas’ also move”.  
After almost 45 years later I walked alone through this street again and talked to local inhabitants. Most of the people have moved away outside the walled city to the newer faraway colonies. The area, once a residential area, is now fully commercialized. The ancient city has changed beyond what it once was. The trader classes have had their fatal effect.  
Now let us move to Lohari Bazaar and move along and reach Gali Pir Bhola. Now this was once a posh walled city area and has the old house of my great thrice removed grandfather. He was a general in the army of Maharajah Ranjit Singh and Sandhu Jatts of the Nilli Bar, and he participated in every battle the Sikhs fought, including Jallianwala. My grandfather married in the famous Chishti family of nearby Kucha Chabakswaran inside Mochi Gate.  
But then as the family expanded they moved to better houses. Near this famous house were those of a few scholars – Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims. My father knew every house by name which I did not. When I returned there a local shopkeeper informed that almost every old resident has moved out. Some got educated in posh schools and were now ‘rich’ businessmen. “They sometimes return with their children to show them their original houses”, he commented.  
So from the ancient portion of the walled city almost every original resident has moved out. All that is left in the minds of the original inhabitants are memories, and very fond ones at that. They cherish the finest foods and have an immense respect for the neighbours. If anyone passes away they invariably return to pay their respects. Naturally, the younger generations have no idea of these values.  
But what else has changed? Let us take a brief view of the ancient portions of the once walled city. Firstly, probably only five per cent of the original inhabitants who lived there 70 years ago still have traces there. The rest have moved out. Given the size of the houses and the need for transportation to faraway places, it does not make economic sense. Plus, families now have become so-called modernized. In a way those remaining are today culturally very different. 
Secondly, with the expansion of the trading classes taking over almost 65 per cent of all housing, the damage to the old way of life has been telling. To encourage cheap labour to work in the new bazaars, Afghan refugees provided the ideal cheap solution. Today well over 65 per cent of the population is now Pushto-speaking Afghans.  
So we have a situation where the traditional Punjabi-speaking population, and Lahori Punjabi at that, face a challenge from the Pushtoons. But to the credit of our ancient language we also see Pathan children now speaking Lahori Punjabi.  
On the cultural side the local population no longer is sensitized to the architectural history of Lahore. Also they knock down old houses at random. This damages a heritage beyond measure. To put a stop to this carnage the Walled City of Lahore Authority was created. Their effort is before everyone. Surely there is a need for a greater investment in conserving the hundreds of old houses that stand threatened.
So we have the original inhabitants moving out, and then we have an almost alien population speaking a different language moving in, we have an extremist view people taking over our cultural sites, small in size that they may be, and we have a decaying old houses falling by the day. Not a pretty picture by any account.
What must be done to reverse this negative situation. Our young, especially schoolchildren, need to study our city’s past in greater detail. For that we need sensitized teachers. Now where do we get such teachers in a country with the lowest functional literacy rate in the world. The challenge is massive … but a way out must be found.

The breach occurred in the wee hours and could not be plugged even after the passage of almost 16 hours, protesting farmers said. They said Hakra Canal, which was the largest canal of the district, had been overflowing for a few days due to heavy rain in the area and it was feared that the banks of the canal could be broken or breached due to weak embankment.  
However, the irrigation officials did not bother to take any measure to control the situation, they added.  
They said the breach occurred in the canal but the officials did not reach the spot even after the passage of 16 hours despite being timely informed. They said crops spread over hundreds of acres had been inundated and if the breach could not be plugged on an immediate basis, it is feared that thousands of acres of crops and nearby villages would also be flooded.  
An official of the irrigation department said that due to heavy and consistent rainfall in the district, canal embankments had weakened resulting in the breach. He claimed that machinery and staffers were being sent to the spot and the breach would be plugged soon.

The rain has not only ensured water supply for the human as well as animal populations in the area, but also fed the grazing fields comprising plants and bushes for the herds for several months.  
Cholistan Development Authority (CDA) Managing Director (MD) Mahar Khalid Ahmed told Dawn that with the recent intermittent showers, the rainwater has also accumulated in the low-lying plains of Cholistan, converting them into temporary ponds that may dry up during the next week or so.  
He says that the rains during the last week have proved a boon for the Cholistani people and their livestock, who had been facing drought-like conditions during the previous months of May and June, creating an acute shortage of drinking water.  
He says that these showers have also a moderating effect on otherwise harsh weather in the area, hoping that it will the local population that had moved to relatively greener areas along with their livestock in search of water and fodder to return to their native places.  
The CDA managing director appreciated the role of various government departments and agencies, including divisional and district administrations, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), Rescue 1122 and some NGOs for taking immediate relief and rescue measures to provide drinking water in the desert area during the previous two months of scorching heat.
