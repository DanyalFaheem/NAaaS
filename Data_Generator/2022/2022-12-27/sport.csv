He was 49. 
“Goodbye Wizard,” twee­ted O’Neill’s formative club Naci­onal after he passed away due to chronic cirrhosis in a Montev­ideo hospital where he had been rushed on Saturday in a coma, suffering from a hemorrhage. 
“The most talented player I’ve ever seen,” was how French World Cup winner Zidane, a team-mate at Juve­ntus, descr­ibed O’Neill. 
After making his debut for Nacional at the age of 18 in 1992, O’Neill was transferred to Cag­liari in Italy three years later. 
In 2000, he moved to Juve­ntus but after playing for the Turin giants for just one season, he was farmed out to Perugia. 
He then returned to Naci­onal before quitting in 2003. 
O’Neill earned 19 caps for Uruguay and scored two goals. He was part of the squad that was eliminated in the first round of the World Cup in South Korea and Japan in 2002 although he did not feature in any of the group games due to injury. 
“Uruguayan football is in mourning. One of the best players to emerge in recent decades and who knew how to shine on the field with his talent and magic has left us,” wrote the El Pais newspaper. 
El Observador said that “Fa­b­ian O’Neill was one of those great talents wasted.... his career was marked by alc­ohol and excesses.”

3,"Conte hails Kane, Newcastle cruise as Premier League returns",LONDON: Antonio Conte hailed Harry Kane’s character after the England captain recovered from his World Cup...,"LONDON: Antonio Conte hailed Harry Kane’s character after the England captain recovered from his World Cup heartache to help Tottenham Hotspur rescue a 2-2 draw at Brentford, while Newcastle United climbed to second place with a 3-0 win at Leicester City on Monday.
In the first Premier League fixture since the World Cup break in mid-November, Tottenham were in danger of a damaging defeat after Vitaly Janelt and Ivan Toney put Brentford in command at the Community Stadium.
Janelt fired home after 15 minutes with a close-range finish after Tottenham keeper Fraser Forster spilled Mathias Jensen’s shot.
Toney struck from close-range in the 54th minute from Christian Norgaard’s flick on.
But Kane netted with a 65th minute header to start the Tottenham recovery in his first game since missing a crucial penalty in England’s World Cup quarter-final defeat against France.
Brentford have not beaten Tottenham since 1948 and their long wait for a victory over the north Londoners goes on after Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg curled home with 19 minutes left.
Tottenham boss Conte praised England captain Kane for his contribution following his World Cup disappointment.
“When he came back he was good. We know the importance of Harry for us, his personality, his character. He’s the best player we have. I’m happy that he scored today,” Conte said. “Since last season we have made a good step. Now we have to continue to push ourselves. It is not easy. We have shown big character,” Conte added.

Tottenham stay fourth in the table, four points ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United in the race to qualify for the Champions League.
Newcastle are three points ahead of Tottenham as their unexpected push for a top four finish gathers pace.
The Magpies, revitalised by boss Eddie Howe since their Saudi-backed takeover, were ahead with less than three minutes on the clock when Chris Wood converted a penalty awarded for Daniel Amartey’s foul on Joelinton.
Newcastle doubled their lead in sublime fashion in the sixth minute as Miguel Almiron played a one-two with Bruno Guimaraes and slotted past Danny Ward for his eighth goal in his last eight league games.
Joelinton headed home from a corner in the 32nd minute as Newcastle made it six successive league victories — their best run in the competition since 2012.
Everton suffered a damaging 2-1 defeat against relegation rivals Wolves as Rayan Ait-Nouri struck in final seconds for the visitors at Goodison Park.
Yerry Mina gave Everton a seventh minute lead when the Colombia defender headed home from Dwight McNeil’s corner.
Wolves levelled midway through the first half as Joao Moutinho’s cross was volleyed in by Daniel Podence.
Ait-Nouri poked home from close range after Everton failed to deal with a counter-attack in the fifth minute of stoppage-time.
Third bottom Wolves now sit only one point behind fourth bottom Everton, whose manager Frank Lampard is under increasing pressure.
Southampton slipped to the bottom of the table after a 3-1 home defeat against south-coast rivals Brighton.
Adam Lallana headed Brighton in front against his former club in the 14th minute and Romain Perraud’s own goal increased the lead 10 minutes before half-time.
Brighton struck again early in the second half through Solly March’s long-range blast.
James Ward-Prowse reduced the deficit on the rebound after his penalty was saved by Robert Sanchez, but it wasn’t enough to avoid defeat in boss Nathan Jones’ first home league game in charge.
Fulham won 3-0 at nine-man Crystal Palace, who had Tyrick Mitchell and James Tomkins sent off. Bobby De Cordova-Reid, Tim Ream and Aleksandar Mitrovic scored Fulham’s goals.

4,Ex-Tokyo Olympics official granted bail in bribery case,"TOKYO: A former Tokyo Olympics official arrested on bribery charges was granted bail on Monday, public broadcaster...","TOKYO: A former Tokyo Olympics official arrested on bribery charges was granted bail on Monday, public broadcaster NHK reported.
A Tokyo District court set bail for Haruyuki Takahashi at 80 million yen ($603,000), NHK reported.
Prosecutors have raided multiple companies in recent mon­ths in a widening corruption scandal related to the Tokyo Games.
Takahashi, a former member of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics board and before that an executive at advertising giant Dentsu Inc, was arrested in August on suspicion of receiving bribes from Olympic sponsors.
Reuters reported in 2020 that Takahashi, who was paid millions of dollars to work on Tokyo’s successful bid for the Olympics, said he played a key role in securing the support of a former Olympics powerbroker who was later suspected by French prosecutors of taking bribes to help Japan’s bid.

5,Comanche takes early lead in Sydney-Hobart yacht race,SYDNEY: Andoo Comanche took a penalty turn inside the opening 20 minutes of the Sydney Hobart yacht race on Monday...,"SYDNEY: Andoo Comanche took a penalty turn inside the opening 20 minutes of the Sydney Hobart yacht race on Monday but still managed to get ahead of the pack, with fellow contenders LawConnect, Black Jack and Wild Oats close behind. 
Wild Oats also took a penalty turn in an action-packed start that allowed LawCo­nnect to grab the early advantage, only for Comanche to surge ahead after taking the wide line. 
The annual 628 nautical-mile (1,170-km) race in the Tasman Sea from Sydney and across Bass Strait to Hobart is one of the world’s most difficult yachting events. 
A fleet of 109 had lined up for the race after heavy early morning fog on Sydney Harbour, with Comanche’s 2017 line honours race record of one day, nine hours, 15 minutes and 24 seconds up for grabs in favourable winds. 
The yachts are set to cross the finish line on Wednesday. 
“We always think we’re going to be the best boat out there and do as well as we can,” Comanche skipper John Winning said ahead of the race. “We’ll just try and outsail the others and win it on that.” 
Mark Richards, skipper of nine-time line honours-winning supermaxi Wild Oats, said his crew was buoyant after preparing for exactly these conditions. 
“We put all our eggs in one basket and we put all our money on black for a downwind forecast and we have ended up getting it,” he told public broadcaster ABC. “I think Wild Oats is going to be very fast. “The world is going to find out who is the fastest boat downwind. Is it Comanche? Is it Black Jack? Is it LawConnect? Or is it Wild Oats? The weather’s fantastic and we couldn’t have asked for a better forecast.” 
Weather is a critical factor in the race, which was first held in 1945. 
Though the supermaxis are expected to be powered by northerly winds to a quick finish as early as Tuesday, slower mid- to small-sized boats will still be in the water in the following days facing possible gales and changes in wind direction. 
In 1998, when a deep depression exploded over the fleet in the Bass Strait, six men died, five boats sank and 55 sailors were rescued. 
Black Jack took line honours last year after a tight tussle with LawConnect, ending years of frustrating near misses to cross the finish line on the River Derwent after two days, 12 hours, 37min and 17sec. 
Ichi Ban, which is not racing this year, was the 2021 winner of the overall handicap prize, which takes into account the yachts’ sizes. The boat pipped rival Celestial in a race where dangerous waves and weather conditions saw many withdraw. 
International boats are making a return after the race was cancelled in 2020 for the first time due to the pandemic, and Covid hit the fleet last year. 
Entrants come from Germany (Orione), Hong Kong (Antipodes), Hungary (Cassi­opeia 68), New Caledonia (Eye Candy and Poulpito), New Zealand (Caro), Britain (Sunrise) and the United States (Warrior Won). 
Sunrise is a proven ocean racer, winning the 2021 Fastnet Race in Britain, while Caro has been tip­p­ed to take overall handicap honours, although skipper Max Klink played down his prospects ahead of the race saying: “I do not think we are the favourite.”

8,Juve scandal rumbles on as accounts stay deep in the red,MILAN: Juventus’ troubles will continue on Tuesday when the shareholders of Italy’s biggest football club meet ...,"MILAN: Juventus’ troubles will continue on Tuesday when the shareholders of Italy’s biggest football club meet to approve the latest disastrous set of accounts following last month’s mass boardroom resignations.
Juve’s entire board quit as an investigation by prosecutors in Turin into allegations of false accounting and irregularities in the transfer and loans of players led to 15 people and the club being charged with a variety of offences.
On Tuesday revised losses for the 2021/22 season of 239.3 million euros (255 million dollars) will be ratified, the fifth straight set of annual accounts in the red.
Juve are listed on the Italian stock market and in September announced record losses of 254 million euros, a figure revised downwards after losses for 2020/21 were revised upwards from 209 million euros to 226 million euros.
Those accounts were modified following findings of stock exchange regulator CONSOB as well as auditors and prosecutors.
Tuesday’s meeting had been scheduled for November 23 but was pushed back just over a week before the board announced its decision to step down.
Chairman Andrea Agnelli was among those to resign, bringing to an end a 12-year reign which brought a host of trophies and for a period re-established Juventus as one of Europe’s best teams.
However, Juve’s run of nine straight league titles came to an end in 2021 and their performances on the continent plummeted after they spent more than 100 million euros to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid three years before.
Ronaldo’s arrival coincided with an increase in salary costs which combined with the Covid-19 pandemic led to two capital increases worth 700 million euros from parent company Exor, controlled by the powerful Agnelli family.
In documents seen by AFP, Juve are accused of artificially inflating transfer values and also lying to the stock market when announcing at the height of the pandemic that players would help the club save 90 million euros by giving up their salaries for March, April, May and June 2020.
Prosecutors say the club privately assured players they would only have to give up one month’s salary, saving just 22 million euros.
Shareholders are set to meet again on January 18 to appoint the new board which is to be led by Gianluca Ferrero, a Turin-born former head of coffee brand Lavazza who is trusted by Exor chairman John Elkann — Andrea Agnelli’s cousin.
A preliminary court hearing next month will decide whether those charged by prosecutors will be defendants in a trial which would provide a troublesome backdrop to the second half of what has already been a complicated season for Juventus.
The Turin giants were knocked out of the Champions League after finishing the group stage with just three points and trail Serie A leaders Napoli by 10 points.
Coach Massimiliano Allegri had been under fire following an appalling start to the campaign but a run of six league wins in the month leading up to the World Cup dragged Juve to third in Serie A.
The chaos elsewhere hasn’t had a direct impact on Allegri, who is still in place alongside sporting director Federico Cherubini.
For Agnelli however the season is becoming something of a nightmare, with Juve’s finances also under investigation by UEFA.
European football’s governing body also appear to be winning the battle against the remaining proponents of the aborted Super League, which included Agnelli.
The European Court of Justice’s top legal advisor said earlier this month that UEFA and global body FIFA had acted within the law when they threatened to expel clubs or players who joined the closed breakaway league.
As Juventus chairman Agnelli and his counterparts at Barcelona and reigning European champions Real Madrid were hanging on to the Super League idea despite its collapse just 48 hours after its announcement in 2021 following fan outrage.
The Super League’s holding company’s claim that UEFA abused its position in the market to squeeze out fair competition was rejected by Advocate General Athanasios Rantos. A definitive ruling is expected to be made official by the ECJ early next year.

9,"Wary of ‘isolation’, Najam Sethi indicates PCB may soften stance on India",Suggests PCB under him will pursue dialogue with Asian Cricket Council rather than going on the offensive.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board may soften its stance against India over the controversy surrounding the hosting rights of the 2023 Asia Cup, the body’s Management Committee chairman Najam Sethi said on Monday. 
Sethi, who headed last week’s toppling of the former Board of Governors of the PCB — led by chairman Ramiz Raja — believed it was not in Pakistan’s favour to take any step that leads to isolation from the cricket world. 
Under Ramiz, the PCB was irked by the comments made by the Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary Jay Shah back in October, in which the official unilaterally stated that the Asia Cup will be played at a neutral venue. 
Shah — who is also the president of the Asian Cricket Council — had said it was impossible for the Indian team to travel to Pakistan as the country’s government would not allow that. 
The PCB had responded with anger and threatened to pull out of the tournament as well as from the 2023 Cricket World Cup, which is set to be staged in India in October-November. 
Sethi, however, suggested that the PCB under him will pursue a dialogue with the ACC rather than going on the offensive.  
“As far as Asia Cup is concerned, I will go to ACC and see what the situation is; we’ll take a decision which is in the better interest of the game,” he said.  
“We have to see what other board’s position is, we have to play cricket with everyone, we will not take any step which can cause any isolation.” 
The 74-year-old also ruled out the possibility of Pakistan’s absence from the World Cup in protest. The decision to participate in the one-day showpiece, he said, will be taken according to the government’s guidance. 
“We will obey whatever the government would suggest to us and we will seek the government’s advice when the time arrives, similar to the last time I was the chairman,” noted Sethi. 
RAMIZ SLAMS ‘POLITICAL INTERFERENCE’ 
Meanwhile, Ramiz was critical of the new PCB regime, which took over following instructions from the office of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif — who as premier is also the patron of the PCB. 
Ramiz’s ouster meant the PCB’s 2019 constitution was also suspended to be eventually replaced by the one approved in 2014, bringing significant structural changes to the board’s administration. 
“There should be no political interference in cricket,” Ramiz, who was handpicked by former prime minister Imran Khan to be elected as chairman last year, said on his YouTube channel.  
“The Government of Pakistan removed a Test cricketer from the chairmanship of PCB just to accommodate Sethi. This is a highly disrespectful way of treating your cricketers.  
“The Government of Pakistan changed the whole Constitution of PCB just to accommodate Sethi. I have never seen this ever in my life,” he added. 
Since Sethi’s 14-member Manag­ement Committee took charge, it has sacked national chief selector Moham­mad Wasim along with few other officials. The committee aims to make big changes, including replacing the provincial associations sides in domestic cricket with departments.

10,Top Australian Test award named after Shane Warne,"MELBOURNE: Austr­alia’s men’s Test Player of the Year award will be renamed in Shane Warne’s honour, ...","MELBOURNE: Austr­alia’s men’s Test Player of the Year award will be renamed in Shane Warne’s honour, officials said Monday, as tributes were paid to the late spin-king at the Boxing Day Test against South Africa.
Warne, considered by ma­­ny as second in stature only to Donald Bradman in sports-mad Australia, died unexpectedly aged just 52 in March.
The Shane Warne Men’s Test Player of the Year award will be presented annually, second only to the prestigious Allan Border Medal for the most outstanding player across all formats.
“As one of Australia’s all-time greats, it is fitting we acknowledge Shane’s extrao­r­dinary contribution to Test cricket by naming this award in his honour in perpetuity,” said Cricket Australia chief Nick Hockley.
The announcement came on the opening day of the Boxing Day Test at the Melb­ourne Cricket Ground, War­ne’s home venue where he achieved many feats, including an Ashes hat-trick and his 700th Test wicket.
Warne’s Test cap number 350 has been painted square of the wicket for the duration of the match, while both the Australian and South African teams wore floppy white hats in his memory during the national anthem ceremony.
“His place as a legend of Australian and world sport is assured,” added Hockley. “Whilst we continue to mourn his passing, it is fitting that we honour Shane at his beloved Boxing Day Test at the MCG.”
A stand at the venue has already been named in his honour. Credited with reviving the art of leg-spin, Warne took 708 Test wickets as part of a dominant Australian team in the 1990s and 2000s before becoming a respected commentator.

11,Sarfraz cherishes playing for Pakistan again,"On Monday, Sarfraz played his first Test in nearly four years.","KARACHI: Sarfraz Ahmed’s heart was pounding as he looked to survive the three deliveries before lunch. For someone playing his 50th Test match, having captained Pakistan in quite a few matches, this was odd. Odd was also the fact that Sarfraz was playing his first Test in nearly four years. And that he was making his maiden appearance in the whites for Pakistan on his home turf was even more astounding.
In came New Zealand’s Ish Sodhi with his leg-spin. Sarfraz whipped one towards mid-wicket for no run, beautifully drove another through the offside and then came the forward defensive. Survival achieved. 
“Look, if you ask about how I was feeling when I played the first three deliveries and if someone had checked my heartbeat at that time then probably the meter would have exploded,” said the wicket-keeper batter in a press conference following the close of the first day’s play of the opening Test against the BlackCaps on Monday.
Sarfraz then revealed why and how, at 35, a player would get so nervous. 
“My heart was beating so fast and it was a similar feeling to that of making your debut as I was playing a Test match after a very long time and the match too was in crunch position at that moment.”
Thankfully, the former Pakistan skipper did not have to wait too much before going into the dressing room at lunch. He said he was brought back to a normal state of mind by his team-mates during the break  
“When we walked into the pavilion for the lunch break, boys who have played alongside me, noticed my nervousness and were trying to calm me down.”
And it was evident that his nerves had settled when he played his signature sweep shot to take his second boundary off left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel.
With his simple, basic batting style, the right-hander pulled half-trackers, guided the ball with intricate wrist work and drove spinners off the bounce with ease.
He saw his captain Babar — once his subordinate — reach his century. Babar, in turn, celebrated Sarfraz’s 19th Test fifty.
The partnership between the current and ex Pakistan skippers was worth 196 runs and it brought the hosts back into the match after they were reeling at 110-4 at one point. 
“.. Babar gave me a lot of confidence as a senior player and carried me with great determination as I also needed confidence at that time.”
It would have been a fitting return for Sarfraz had he scored a hundred, a milestone he fell just 14 runs short of. But for him, gratitude for what he managed to achieve meant more than ruing what he missed out on.
“I was sad but then I thought it would have been worse had I got out for a duck and I’m grateful,” Sarfraz said of his dismissal.
The wicket-keeper was picked after a chaotic week in Pakistan cricket, that saw Najam Sethi replacing Ramiz Raja as the country’s cricket board chief and the appointment of former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi as the interim chief selector.
Afridi did not take too much time to exercise his powers as he added three new players to the Pakistan squad and is said to have influenced Babar to pick Sarfraz over mainstay wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan.
For Sarfraz, four years on the sidelines were all about playing cricket wherever he got the chance to, before things naturally fall into place.
“I used to ponder if I would ever play my 50th Test,” he said. “When I got to know yesterday that I was going to play, it got me really excited.
“I had tried to focus on playing as much cricket as I could while being out of the side and I think I’ve finally been rewarded for my patience.”

12,"Ton-up Babar, returning Sarfraz help Pakistan gain foothold in first NZ Test","KARACHI: After seven days of chaos surrounding the Pakistan Cricket Board, the national side’s captain Babar Azam...","KARACHI: After seven days of chaos surrounding the Pakistan Cricket Board, the national side’s captain Babar Azam was back to business, so was his predecessor Sarfraz Ahmed.
While Babar added yet another hundred to his glittering record, Sarfraz played the supporting role in what was his first Test in nearly four years as both carried out a brilliant rescue effort after early jitters for Pakistan
The hosts were 317-5 by the close of play on the opening day of the first Test against New Zealand here at the National Stadium on Monday with Babar playing at 161.
Sarfraz, however, lost his wicket late in the day after scoring 86 off 153 balls, ending a 196-run partnership with Babar. 
“It was a very good partnership,” Sarfraz, who replaced Mohammad Rizwan, said after stumps. “I hope it ends up helping the team.”
As of now, it is safe to say that the collaboration between the former and current Pakistan captains brought the team back into the match.
The hosts were reeling at 48-3 just 15 overs into the innings after Babar had won the toss and opted to bat first on spin-friendly surface.
The hard new ball was responding well to the nature of the pitch and New Zealand put spinners into attack early and soon bore fruit when opener Abdullah Shafique was stumped off left-armer Ajaz Patel.
It was then off-spinner Michael Bracewell’s time to strike when first drop Shan Masood came down the wicket only to miss the ball and get stumped.
Abdullah’s opening partner Imam-ul-Haq seemed to rebuild with Babar on the other end before the left-hander became Brac—ewell’s second victim in a failed attempt to clear the field after adding 24.
It could have been over early for Babar too had Daryl Mitchell at slip had held on to a regulation catch off Bracewell as the batter edged one while playing at 12. 
Pakistan were able to find some breathing space for themselves after Babar and Saud Shakil — who arrived after Imam’s dismissal — combined for 62 runs, only for the latter to fall at 22 off New Zealand captain Tim Southee, leaving the hosts at 110-4 just ahead of lunch.
By that point, Babar had already brought up his fifty as he kept finding the boundary, especially off the New Zealand spinners. He also survived a run out attempt at 54.
Post lunch, it was all about Babar and Sarfraz, who had opened his account with a four off leg-spinner Ish Sodhi on the penultimate ball before the break.
The 35-year-old then played the sweep shot to get another boundary, this time off Patel, showing signs of decent form.
As the ball softened, the New Zeala­nders struggled to use the pitch in their favour and Babar and Sarfraz kept scoring at nearly four runs per over.
DRS came into play to save Sarfraz when a caught behind decision by umpire Aleem Dar was overturned.
Three overs later, Babar brought up his century with a slog sweep for six off Bracewell.
The Pakistan captain took on the off-spinner for two more boundaries two overs later as the side finished the second session at 224-4.
Sarfraz reached his half-century with a double off Sodhi and celebrated it with a drive off the spinner before getting dismissed eventually as Patel forced an edge off his bat for Mitchell to take it safely this time. 
“Babar made the most of his chance and batted really well,” Patel said 
during the post-day press conference. “Obviously no one wants to drop catches but it happens sometimes, it’s just the nature of the game.”
Babar is now the highest run-scorer in Tests this year with 1,170 runs in nine outings. He also beat Mohammad Yousuf’s 2006 aggregate of 2,435 in all three formats, accumulating 2,584 runs across the board this year.

13,Not enough attention paid to international schedule: Stokes,"LONDON: England Test captain Ben Stokes has raised concerns over the sche­d­uling of international cricket.

...","LONDON: England Test captain Ben Stokes has raised concerns over the sche­d­uling of international cricket.
“The scheduling doesn’t get enough attention that it should,” Stokes told the BBC on Monday. “Some people say ‘you are playing for England, that should be enough’. But there is a lot more to factor in.”
Stokes highlighted Engl­and’s three-match One-day International series in Aust­ralia in November, which started four days after they won the Twenty20 World Cup.
He described it as a  “series which meant nothing”.
Stokes announced his retirement from ODIs in July, citing the  “unsustainable” rigour of playing all three formats of the game. The 31-year-old was part of the England team who won the ODI World Cup in 2019.
“You want international cricket to be the highest standard. But we have seen a lot of different squads being picked and players being rested, and that’s not the way international cricket should go,” Stokes added.

14,Green machine puts South Africa on Boxing Day canvas,Cameron Green takes maiden five-wicket innings haul as Australia rip through South Africa’s fragile batting in second Test.,"MELBOURNE: Cameron Green celebrated landing one of the richest contracts in Indian Premier League history by taking a maiden five-wicket innings haul as Australia ripped through South Africa’s fragile batting in the second Test on Monday. 
After the visitors were dismissed for 189, an aggressive David Warner, in his 100th Test, was unbeaten on 32 and Marnus Labuschagne was not out on five to steer the hosts to 45-1 at stumps on day one, trailing by 144 runs but well in control to the delight of a festive Boxing Day crowd of 64,876 at a sun-drenched Melbourne Cricket Ground. 
Usman Khawaja was out for one, caught behind by Kyle Verreynne off Kagiso Rabada. 
“That’s cricket summed up,” Green told reporters. “You can have a really slow start to the summer and think cricket’s so tough and then you have a few days like this, and it brings you back 
“It’s a very special feeling [getting five wickets],” added Green, who held the ball aloft to a roaring crowd after finishing with career-best innings figures of 5-27, a milestone for a cricketer long tipped for stardom. 
At the other end of the spectrum, Warner came to the crease under pressure to prove he still belongs in Test whites in his milestone match. 
The 36-year-old, who failed twice in Brisbane, saw off a maiden over before smashing Rabada to the fence, one of three boundaries, to leave Australia well positioned ahead of a hot day in the field for South Africa on Tuesday. 
Australia won the first of three Tests by six wickets inside two days on a hostile and green Gabba pitch in Brisbane last week. 
The deck at the MCG was less bowler-friendly, but captain Pat Cummins surprisingly chose to field at a venue where toss-winning teams normally bat first. 
It proved to be an inspired decision with the Proteas losing early wickets as they again struggled against the hosts’ bowling firepower. 
After slumping to 67-5, Verreynne and Marco Jansen launched a stirring fightback in a gutsy 112-run stand. 
But then Green — bought for 175 million rupees ($2.12 million) by Mumbai Indians in the IPL auction last week; the second-most expensive buy behind England’s Sam Curran -- went on a blitz, snapping the partnership when Verreynne got an outside edge on 52 that Steve Smith collected. 
Two balls later, Jansen was gone, caught by wicketkeeper Alex Carey for 59 off Green before the giant Australian bowled Kagiso Rabada and Lungi Ngidi. 
Green took 4-8 in the spell with the Proteas losing their last five wickets for 10 runs. 
“Kind of when you’re not trying to get wickets, you get them,” said Green. “It actually became a really nice wicket (for batting). The ball got old and wasn’t doing much. Thankfully [our] plan came off.” 
South Africa started nervously, losing Sarel Erwee and Theunis de Bruyn cheaply. 
They were stunned just before lunch when Elgar, who passed 5,000 Test runs, and the experienced Temba Bavuma departed in consecutive balls. 
It left them in trouble at 58-4 and the inexperienced middle order facing a daunting task. 
When Khaya Zondo was out in the fifth over after lunch for five, courtesy of a stunning Marnus Labuschagne diving catch, the end looked nigh before Verreynne and Jansen dug in. 
“The occasion was awesome, but unfortunately it wasn’t the best day for our team,” said Verreynne. “I felt today was probably the first time in the last couple of games that we had more soft dismissals than not, and that is probably the most disappointing thing.” 
On a humid day, Cummins asked some searching early questions, dropping Elgar on seven off his own bowling and then having two big lbw shouts against Erwee denied. 
Erwee lived dangerously and was no match for local hero Scott Boland. 
The seamer, who took 6-7 in the corresponding Test against England a year ago, came on to thunderous applause and got the breakthrough in his second over, with Khawaja taking a low catch at slip to remove Erwee for 18. 
South Africa’s batting has been under the pump recently and as the senior player, Elgar knew he had to stick around. 
But it was a grind, with the captain surviving when an inside edge off Boland sent the ball rolling onto his stumps only for the bails to stay on, then being dropped by Nathan Lyon. 
Green got Australia’s second wicket when Theunis De Bruyn attempted a pull shot and wicketkeeper Carey took an easy catch. 
Disaster then struck with Elgar needlessly run out by Labusch­agne going for a single on 26, and Bavuma fell for one next ball, edging Mitchell Starc to Carey.
