0,More NGOs halt work in Afghanistan after Taliban ban on women,Six aid groups have paused operations in Afghanistan since Taliban rulers ordered NGOs to stop women staff from working.,"LONDON: Christian Aid and ActionAid on Monday became the latest foreign aid groups to suspend operations in Afghanistan after the country’s Taliban rulers ordered all NGOs to stop women staff from working.
Announcements by the two groups take to six the number of bodies who have paused their operations in the country.
Christian Aid was  “rapidly seeking clarity... and urging the authorities to reverse the ban”, head of global programmes Ray Hasan said in a statement. “Whilst we do this, we are unfortunately pausing the work of our programmes,” he added.
ActionAid said that if women were banned from working with the group it would  “prevent us from reaching out to half of the population that are already reeling from hunger”.
“ActionAid has made the difficult decision to temporarily halt most of its programmes in Afghanistan until a clearer picture emerges,” it said in a statement.
On Sunday Save the Children, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE all announced they were putting their operations on hold.
The International Rescue Committee, which provides emergency response in health, education and other areas and employs 3,000 women across Afghanistan, also said it was suspending services. “Millions of people in Afghanistan are on the verge of starvation,” Christian Aid’s Hasan said on Monday.
“Reports that families are so desperate they have been forced to sell their children to buy food are utterly heartbreaking,” he said, adding that a ban on women aid workers would  “only curtail our ability to help the growing number of people in need”.
The ban is the latest blow against women’s rights in Afghanistan since the Taliban reclaimed power last year.
Less than a week ago, the hardline Islamists also barred women from attending universities, prompting global outrage and protests in some Afghan cities.

1,Historic winter storm leaves nearly 50 dead across US,Death toll reaches 25 in New York; blizzard conditions continue to prevail in parts of the US Northeast.,"NEW YORK: US emergency crews counted the grim costs of a colossal winter storm that brought Christmas chaos to millions, especially in hard-hit western New York, where the death toll reached 25 on Monday in what authorities described as a  “war with mother nature.” 
Blizzard conditions continue to prevail in parts of the US Northeast, the stubborn remnants of a massive sprawl of extreme weather including severe cold that gripped the country over several days, causing widespread power outages, travel delays and at least 47 deaths nationwide.
The extreme weather forced the cancellation of more than 15,000 flights in recent days including more than 1,700 on Monday, according to tracking site Flightaware.com.
Buffalo — a US city that is no stranger to foul winter weather — has been buried under staggering amounts of snow, with the National Weather Service forecasting up to 14 inches on Monday in addition to the several feet that have already left the city marooned, with a virtual collapse of emergency services.
The blizzard has stubbornly refused to release its grip on western New York’s Erie County, 
where Buffalo is located and which has become the epicenter of the crisis.
“In addition to the 13 confirmed deaths yesterday, the Erie County Department of Health medical examiner’s office has confirmed an additional 12 deaths, bringing the total for the blizzard to 25 deaths county-wide,” Erie County executive Mark Poloncarz said in a press briefing.
The ferocious weather makes this  “the worst storm probably in our lifetime, and the history of the city,” Poloncarz said, noting the death toll in Erie will likely surpass that of Buffalo’s infamous blizzard of 1977, when nearly 30 people died.
With more snow in the forecast and most of Buffalo  “impassable,” he warned residents to bunker down and stay in place. “This is not the end yet, we are not there,” he said.
National Guard members and other teams have rescued hundreds of people from snow-covered cars and homes without electricity, but authorities have said more people remain trapped.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul, a native of Buffalo, said she was stunned by what she saw during a Sunday reconnaissance tour of the city.
“It is (like) going to a war zone, and the vehicles along the sides of the roads are shocking,” Hochul said, describing eight-foot (2.4-metre) snow drifts against homes and how power outages made for life-threatening conditions. “This is a war with mother nature,” she said.
The extreme weather sent wind chill temperatures in all 48 contiguous US states below freezing over the weekend.
Sweeping power outages
At one point on Saturday, nearly 1.7 million customers were without electricity in the biting cold, according to tracker poweroutage.us.
That number has dropped substantially, although there were still some 50,000 without electricity on Monday morning on the US east coast.
Due to frozen electric substations, some Erie County residents were not expected to regain power until Tuesday, with one substation reportedly buried under 18 feet of snow, a senior county official said.
Officials described historically dangerous conditions in the snow-prone Buffalo region, with hours-long whiteouts and bodies discovered in vehicles and under snow banks. Emergency workers continued the difficult search for those in need of rescue.
The city’s international airport remains closed until Tuesday and a driving ban remained in effect for Buffalo and much of Erie County.
Road ice and white-out conditions also led to the temporary closure of some of the nation’s busiest transport routes, including part of the cross-country Interstate 70 highway.
Drivers were being warned not to take to the roads — even as the nation reached what is usually its busiest time of year for travel.

2,Daughter of ex-Thai PM Thaksin extends pre-election poll lead,BANGKOK: The youngest daughter of billionaire former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra remains Thailand’s top...,"BANGKOK: The youngest daughter of billionaire former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra remains Thailand’s top choice to become its next leader, according to an opinion poll, with more than double the score of incumbent and nearest rival Prayuth Chan-ocha.
Paetongtarn Shinawatra, 36, whose father Thaksin and aunt Yingluck both led popularly elected governments toppled in coups, was the top choice for 34pc of respondents in a survey by the Nat­ional Institute of Develo­pment Administration (NIDA).
Paetongtarn’s support rose sharply from 21.6pc from a September poll, when the majority surveyed were undecided. NIDA polled 2,000 voting-age people betw­een Dec 17 and Dec 22. Thailand must hold an election by May next year, according to its election commission, but no date has yet been set.
Best known by her nickname,  “Ung Ing”, Paetongtarn is an executive in the Pheu Thai party, which has yet to name her as its prime minister candidate.
The Shinawatra name has proven to be a huge election draw in Thailand since 2001, synonymous with populist policies that won Thaksin, Yingluck and their allies tens of millions of votes from the rural poor and urban working classes in ballots between 2001 and 2011.

3,Medical staff on frontline of China’s Covid fight say hospitals are ‘overwhelmed’,"BEIJING: In more than three decades of emergency medicine, Beijing-based doctor Howard Bernstein said, he has never...","BEIJING: In more than three decades of emergency medicine, Beijing-based doctor Howard Bernstein said, he has never seen anything like this.
Patients are arriving at his hospital in ever-increasing numbers; almost all are elderly and many are very unwell with Covid and pneumonia symptoms, he said.
Bernstein’s account reflects similar testimony from medical staff across China who are scrambling to cope after China’s abrupt U-turn on its previously strict Covid policies this month was followed by a nationwide wave of infections.
It is by far the country’s biggest outbreak since the pandemic began in the central city of Wuhan three years ago. Beijing government hospitals and crematoriums also have been struggling this month amid heavy demand.
“The hospital is just overwhelmed from top to bottom,” Bernstein said at the end of a  “stressful” shift at the privately owned Beijing United Family Hospital in the east of the capital. “The ICU is full,” as are the emergency department, the fever clinic and other wards, he said.
“A lot of them got admitted to the hospital. They’re not getting better in a day or two, so there’s no flow, and therefore people keep coming to the ER, but they can’t go upstairs into hospital rooms,” he said.  “They’re stuck in the ER for days.” 
In the past month, Bernstein went from never having treated a Covid patient to seeing dozens a day. “The biggest challenge, honestly, is I think we were just unprepared for this,” he said.
Sonia Jutard-Bourreau, 48, chief medical officer at the private Raffles Hospital in Beijing, said patient numbers are five to six times their normal levels, and patients’ average age has shot up by about 40 years to over 70 in the space of a week.
“It’s always the same profile,” she said.  “That is most of the patients have not been vaccinated.”  The patients and their relatives visit Raffles because local hospitals are  “overwhelmed”, she said, and because they wish to buy Paxlovid, the Pfizer-made Covid treatment, which many places, including Raffles, are running low on.
“They want the medicine like a replacement of the vaccine, but the medicine does not replace the vaccine,” Jutard-Bourreau said, adding that there are strict criteria for when her team can prescribe it.
Jutard-Bourreau, who like Bernstein has been working in China for around a decade, fears that the worst of this wave in Beijing has not arrived yet.
Elsewhere in China, medical staff said that resources are already stretched to the breaking point in some cases, as Covid and sickness levels amongst staff have been particularly high.
One nurse based in the western city of Xian said 45 of 51 nurses in her department and all staff in the emergency department have caught the virus in recent weeks.
“There are so many positive cases among my colleagues,” said the 22-year-old nurse, surnamed Wang.  “Almost all the doctors are down with it.”  Wang and nurses at other hospitals said they had been told to report for duty even if they test positive and have a mild fever.
Jiang, a 29-year-old nurse on a psychiatric ward at a hospital in Hubei province, said staff attendance has been down more than 50 percent on her ward, which has stopped accepting new patients. She said she is working shifts of more than 16 hours with insufficient support.

4,Battery swapping spurs Kenya’s electric motorbike drive,"NAIROBI: Over recent months, sets of sturdy, brightly-branded battery swapping stations have cropped up around...","NAIROBI: Over recent months, sets of sturdy, brightly-branded battery swapping stations have cropped up around Kenya’s capital Nairobi, allowing electric motorcyclists to exchange their low battery for a fully-charged one.
It is a sign of an electric motorcyle revolution starting to unfold in Kenya where combustion-engine motorbikes are a cheaper and quicker way to get around than cars but environmental experts say are 10 times more polluting.
East Africa’s biggest economy is betting on electric-powered motorcycles, its renewables-heavy power supply and position as a technology and start-up hub to lead the region’s shift to zero-emission electric mobility.
The battery swapping system not only saves time — essential for Kenya’s more than one million motorcyclists, most of whom use the bikes commercially — but also saves buyers money as many sellers follow a model in which they retain ownership of the battery, the bike’s most expensive part.
“It doesn’t make a lot of economic and business sense for them to acquire a battery...which would almost double the cost of the bike,” said Steve Juma, the co-founder of electric bike company Ecobodaa.
Ecobodaa has 50 test electric motorcyles on the road now and plans to have 1,000 by the end of 2023 which it sells for about $1,500 each — roughly the same price as combustion-engine bikes thanks to the exclusion of the battery from the cost.
After the initial purchase, the electric motorcyle — designed to be sturdy enough to traverse rocky roads — is cheaper to run than petrol-guzzling ones.

5,Brazilian man arrested for bomb plot ahead of president-elect Lula’s inauguration,"Suspect allegedly placed explosives in a fuel truck near Brasilia’s airport, hoping to sow  “chaos”, say media reports.","BRASLIA: Brazilian police have arrested a man after he allegedly placed explosives in a fuel truck near Brasilia’s airport, hoping to sow  “chaos” ahead of president-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s inauguration, local media reported.
The man, identified as George Washington de Oliveira Sousa, was arrested on Saturday on terrorism charges and is a supporter of Brazil’s far-right outgoing president Jair Bolsonaro.
The arrest came after the truck’s driver found the device on Saturday morning in the capital city, where Lula will be sworn in on January 1. And although there was an attempt to activate the device, it did not explode, Robson Candido, civil police general delegate of Brasilia, said in a press conference, according to the news portal G1.
Oliveira Sousa confessed to authorities that the bomb was part of a plan to  “start chaos” and  “prevent the establishment of communism in Brazil,” according to statements by the civil police published in local media. He said the idea was hatched with other Bolsonaro supporters who have been protesting outside the army headquarters in Brasilia, calling for a military intervention to prevent Lula from assuming power.
The goal, Oliveira Sousa told police, was to place at least two explosives in strategic locations, with an aim of initiating a  “declaration of a state of siege in the country” and from there  “provoking an intervention by the armed forces,” Brazilian daily Folha de Sao Paulo reported.
Bolsonaro supporters blocked highways and demonstrated in front of army barracks around the country following Lula’s win in the Oct 30 presidential runoff. Nearly two months later, there are still camps in front of some military bases.
Police said they found an arsenal of weapons in the apartment of Oliveira Sousa, who works at a service station in the northern state of Para.
Oliveira Sousa said he was inspired to acquire the weapons  “by President Bolsonaro’s words,” and had a cache worth about 160,000 reales ($31,000), according to Folha de Sao Paulo. Bolsonaro, a strong supporter of gun rights, has previously stated that  “an armed people will never be enslaved.” 
According to statements, Oliveira Sousa had planned to distribute the weapons among those camping in front of barracks, the paper said.
Lula, a 77-year-old leftist who already served as president of Brazil from 2003 to 2010, will assume power for the third time with a grand inauguration in Brasilia.
Bolsonaro, 67, has meanwhile maintained an extremely low profile since his election loss, with limited public appearances.
On Christmas Eve, he rode his motorcycle for the first time since his defeat and chatted with supporters. And on Sunday, he posted a video on social media in which he wished viewers a  “Merry Christmas.”

6,"Iran reroutes flight, orders football legend Ali Daei’s family off",Ali Daei has backed protests following Mahsa Amini’s death.,"TEHRAN: Iranian football legend Ali Daei, who has backed protests following Mahsa Amini’s death, said on Monday an airplane from Tehran to Dubai had been rerouted and his family ordered off. Daei, 53, a former German Bundesliga striker whose 109 goals at international level were long unsurpassed until Cristiano Ronaldo overtook him, is one of Iran’s most famous footballers.
Daei said his wife and daughter had flown on a Mahan Air flight, taking off from the capital Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport, headed to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, ISNA news agency reported. But the plane was rerouted and made to land on Iran’s Kish island in the Gulf, where his family removed, the state news agency IRNA said.
Quoting the judiciary, IRNA said that  “Daei’s wife had pledged to inform the relevant institutions of her decision before leaving the country”, following their  “association with the groups against the Islamic revolution and rioters and calling for strikes”.
The IRNA report added that  “the flight landed at Kish airport and Ali Daei’s wife and daughter got off the plane”.
‘Taken off’
The former Bayern Munich player, who played in Iran’s 2-1 World Cup victory against the United States in 1998, has said he has been targeted by threats after backing the protests triggered by the death of Amini.
“My daughter and wife were taken off the flight, but they were not arrested”, Daei said, ISNA reported.
“Had they been banned (from leaving), the passport police system should have shown it: no one has given me an answer about this. I really don’t know what is the reason for these things”. Daei said he was trying to arrange his family’s return to Tehran. “Did they want to arrest a terrorist? My wife and daughter were going to Dubai for a few days trip and back”, he added. Daei on Sept 27 used social media to call on the government to  “solve the problems of the Iranian people rather than using repression, violence and arrests”.
In October, Daei said his passport was confiscated by police upon his return from abroad, before being returned to him a few days later. He said he had not gone to the World Cup in Qatar due to the Iranian authorities’ crackdown on the protests.
Two hanged
Iranian  authorities have hanged two men convicted of murder in the southeastern  Sistan-Baluchistan province in the latest executions carried out by the  Islamic republic, the judiciary said on Monday.
Elias Raisi was  found guilty of murder in a family dispute in 2020, and Ayoub Rigi of a  killing using a military weapon over  “personal differences” with the  victim, said the judiciary’s Mizan Online news website.
They were  put to death on Saturday after the victims’ families refused to grant them  clemency under Islamic law, the chief prosecutor in the provincial  capital Zahedan, Mehdi Shamsabadi, was quoted as saying.

7,Suspect charged with deadly shooting of Kurds in Paris,"Suspect ha confessed to a “pathological” hatred for foreigners, say authorities.","PARIS: France charged a suspected gunman on Monday with last week’s murder of three Kurds in Paris, as hundreds of people marched in the French capital to pay tribute to the victims.
The 69-year-old suspect had confessed to a  “pathological” hatred for foreigners and spent nearly a day in a psychiatric facility before being returned to police custody on Sunday, authorities said.
The judge charged the man with murder, attempted murder because of race, ethnicity, nationality or religion as well as for the unauthorised procurement and possession of a weapon, a judicial source said.
The shooting at a Kurdish cultural centre and a nearby hairdressing salon on Friday sparked panic in the city’s bustling 10th district, home to numerous shops and restaurants and a large Kurdish population. Three others were wounded in the attack but none were in a life-threatening condition, with one out of hospital.
The violence has revived the trauma of three unresolved murders of Kurds in 2013 that many blame on Turkey. The community has also expressed anger at the French security services, saying they had done too little to prevent the shooting.
The frustration boiled over on Saturday and furious demonstrators clashed with police in central Paris for a second day running after a tribute rally.
On Monday several hundred people marched in the 10th district, chanting  “Our martyrs do not die” in Kurdish and demanding  “truth and justice”. Small altars bearing candles, flowers and the photographs of the three victims who were fatally shot were put up on the pavement.
A procession headed to another street in the same neighbourhood where three activists from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), an organisation Turkey and its Western allies deem terrorist, were killed in January 2013.
Some in the Kurdish community raised their suspicion that Turkey was involved in Friday’s shooting, but French investigators have not made any announcements to that effect.
“We decided to come as soon as we heard about Friday’s terrorist attack,” one young woman told AFP, declining to give her name for fear of reprisals.

8,"Lured to count trains, Indian youth lose millions in fraud",28 job seekers from Tamil Nadu become victims of railway job scam.,"NEW DELHI: In a country where the Panama Papers and fugitive billionaires have failed to cause ripples, a fraudulent job scheme has caught the nation’s attention.
Reports on Monday spoke of a bizarre railway job scam that has been detected by Delhi Police wherein 28 unemployed youth have been duped of over  2.5 crore. According to a report by PTI news agency, 28 job seekers from Tamil Nadu became the victims of this railway job scam. Most of the victims are graduates with backgrounds in engineering and technical education. The scam occurred this year between June and July at the New Delhi Railway station.
The fraudsters trapped the victims saying they will get a job at the railways if they submit a ‘certain amount’ and finish a one-month training at Delhi’s train station. The 28 people from Tamil Nadu were deployed at different platforms of the New Delhi Railway Station every day for eight hours for a month to count the arrival and departure of trains and their coaches.
They had been told that this was part of their training for positions of travel ticket examiner (TTE), traffic assistant, and clerks. Each victim paid amounts ranging between  2 lakh and  24 lakh to get jobs in the Railways, according to a complaint filed with the Delhi Police’s Economic Offences Wing (EOW).
The scam came to light after 78-year-old M Subbusamy, an ex-serviceman, complained to the Delhi police. Subbusamy had put the victims in touch with the alleged fraudsters, but he has claimed that he was unaware that the entire thing was a scam and that he too had fallen for their trap. For the one-month training which took place between June and July, the victims were duped of  2.67 crore by a group of fraudsters.”
Each candidate paid money ranging from  2 lakh to  24 lakh to Subbusamy who further paid these to a person named Vikas Rana. Rana posed as a deputy director in the Northern Railway office in Delhi,” 25-year-old Snethil Kumar, a victim from Madurai, told The Mint.”
Though the training amount varied for various positions such as travel ticket examiners, traffic assistants, or clerks, everyone underwent the same training, i.e, counting trains at stations,” he added. However, Subbusamy told the PTI news agency that he was not aware that it was a scam. He said since his retirement, he has been helping unemployed youths in his locality to find “a suitable job without any monetary interest”.
In the FIR, he alleged that he met a person named Sivaraman, a resident of Coimbatore, in one of the MP quarters in Delhi. Sivaraman claimed to be very closely associated with MPs and ministers and offered to facilitate employment in the railways for the unemployed in lieu of monetary gains. He further alleged that Sivaraman asked him to come to Delhi along with job seekers. “Initially, I came with three job seekers and when the news of their job training spread in their villages in and around Madurai, 25 more candidates joined in,” Subbusamy said. 
The job seekers also gave medical examinations at the Railway Central Hospital, Connaught Place. They were also called for document verification at the office of the Junior Engineer, Northern Railway, Shankar Market, New Delhi before the final selection.
