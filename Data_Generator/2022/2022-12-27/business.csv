0,Govt weighs options to recover Rs447bn  Gas Infrastructure Development Cess,Ishaq Dar resolves to retrieve every penny from defaulters.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday decided to use all the administrative and legal resources to recover Rs447 billion Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) from commercial and industrial entities which had blocked due payments through high courts despite standing orders of the Supreme Court of Pakistan for recoveries.
The decision was taken at a GIDC meeting presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar. Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Dr Ayesha Ghous Pasha, Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Masood Malik, SAPM on Finance Tariq Bajwa, Secretary Finance, Deputy Attorney General and managing director of OGDCL and representatives of SNGPL, SSGCL and PPL attended.
The meeting was told about the amounts outstanding against various entities and discussed GIDC Act and Supreme Court’s order. It was reported that about Rs447.5bn was still outstanding and needed to be recovered but 3,194 petitions in various high courts were hampering the recovery of about Rs420bn.
It was noted that the Supreme Court in its decision of August 2020 while dismissing all appeals into the GIDC had very clearly ordered recovery of all GIDC accrued by 2020-21 and then suspended future GIDC till such time cess was utilised including collected at the time and due but not yet collected till then was recovered.

Dar resolves to retrieve every penny from defaulters

As a relaxation to various sectors, the apex court had, however, ordered that all GIDC dues as of July 31, 2020, be recovered by the government in 24 installments without a late payment surcharge. At the same time, the court also allowed a late payment surcharge for the delays in payment of “any of the 24 installments”.
However, a total of 3,194 litigants blocked those payments on procedural grounds in various high courts. At present, about 2,099 suits are pending against Sui Southern Gas Company regarding GIDC recovery in Sindh High Court (SHC), followed by another 1,087 suits against Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) in Sindh, Lahore and Peshawar High Courts and eight suits in SHC against Mari Petroleum and OGDCL.
“Examining the court’s decisions and stay orders, the finance minister expressed serious concerns over the non-recoveries of GIDC dues and expressed the resolve of the government to recover each penny from the defaulters,” said an official statement. 
He directed the authorities to share an updated break-up of arrears of sector-wise GIDC in the next meeting to frame up legal and administrative strategy for fast-track recovery of the outstanding dues.
The sources said the government could also lose powers to collect GIDC and the GIDC law would stand annulled in case of failure of the government to carry out development projects like pipelines from Turkmenistan, Iran, or from Karachi to Lahore subject to the conducive international and political environment.
Informed sources said the gas companies could consider using administrative and technical means like reducing pipeline pressure for various sectors to force them to pay their dues besides hiring external legal counsels with fixed and performance fees linked with the proportionate recovery of GIDC arrears to conclude the court cases against chronic defaulters. An out-of-court settlement would be another option like a similar dispensation earlier given to the CNG sector for partial payment of dues besides adjustments against their various refunds and subsidy claims.
According to the Petroleum Division, total GIDC payable by various sectors stood at Rs796bn of which Rs349bn had been received by the government. After clearance of earlier dues of Rs349bn by all sectors, the remaining amounts payable by fertiliser sector now stood at Rs191bn, Rs82bn by CNG, Rs98bn by industry (including Rs54bn of capital power, Rs21bn of general industry and Rs23bn against textiles) followed by Rs39bn against K-Electric.

1,Dollar flight to Kabul continues unabated,"Islamabad must take up issue with Kabul, says Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan chairperson.","KARACHI: Confirming what has been known as an open secret for months now, the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (Ecap) on Monday said that the country has been facing the large-scale outflow of US dollars to Afghanistan ever since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul last year.
Addressing a presser, Ecap Chairman Malik Bostan noted that this situation had eroded Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves. The exchange rate has been destroyed by smuggling and fake imports of dollars as well as Islamabad’s negligence towards the issue, he alleged.
Mr Bostan pointed out that when the Taliban took over Kabul, one greenback was available for Rs155 and Pakistan’s reserves stood at $22 billion. Now the reserves have sunk to their lowest level in about eight years with a dollar selling for Rs225 in the inter-bank market. This unhindered flow of the American currency towards Afghanistan has created a crisis for Pakistan, he added.
Mr Malik said that legally 15 million dollars used to cross each day from Pakistan to Afghanistan since Islamabad has permitted each person to take $1,000 per day while 15,000 people regularly travel to the neighbouring country each day.

Islamabad must take up issue with Kabul, says Bostan

He said that two months ago the Kabul regime stated that all Pakistani currency should be converted into dollar or other foreign currencies. Keeping more than 0.5m Pakistani rupee is prohibited in Kabul and any person found with such amount of PKR would be tried under the anti-money laundering laws.  
“For 42 years Afghans have been trading in PKR. They have hundreds of billions of PKR. But now they are buying dollars from Pakistan at any cost. They will siphon off the entre dollars from Pakistani markets,” Mr Bostan warned, adding that Pakistan must take up the matter with the Kabul government.
He said commercial banks are buying $120m-$130m per month from exchange companies for credit cards. These cards are legally transferring dollars from the country. However, the government has slashed the annual per card spending limit to $30,000. Earlier, there was no limit on such transaction.
The Ecap chief said that in the first quarter of this fiscal about 15,000 containers left Pakistan without paying import duties. The number of containers was much higher than last year’s figure of 3,000 containers in the same quarter. He said Pakistan imports coal, vegetables, dry fruits and other minerals from Afghanistan which also cost $20m-$25m per day. 
“He said the Kabul government has successfully maintained the dollar rate at 88 Afghani and this was due to their policies as they don’t print notes unless and until they get dollars,” he said.
He said exchange companies currently import $3bn through export of other foreign currencies while the remittances amount to $2bn per year. “We can bring $7bn to $8bn per year if the government permits us to have agreements with 50 foreign companies for remittances compared to just 3 we currently have,” he said.

2,"Pak Suzuki stops car, bike production",Company says production activities will remain suspended from Jan 2-6 due to shortage of completely-knocked down kits.,"KARACHI: Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) on Monday announced to keep its production activities suspended from Jan 2-6, 2023 citing a shortage of completely-knocked down (CKD) kits.
Contrary to past practice, the company said its assembly plant of two-wheelers will also remain closed during this period.
In a stock filing on Monday, the company said the State Bank of Pakistan on May 20 introduced a mechanism for prior approval for import under HS Code 8703 category (including CKDs) which had adversely affected the clearance of imported consignments thus affecting the inventory levels.
Other assemblers and vendors have also been shutting down their operations for the last few months owing to a shortage of imported parts and accessories.
Costly Japanese bikes 
Effective from Jan 4, 2023, Yamaha Motor Pakistan Ltd (YMPL) on Monday announced a price increase in YB125Z, YB125Z DX, YBR 125, YBR 125G (red and black) and YBR 125G (matt dark grey) to Rs305,500, Rs327,000, Rs336,000, Rs349,500 and Rs352,500, respectively, from Rs293,500, Rs314,500, Rs322,500, Rs336,000 and Rs339,500.
Association of Pakistan Motorcycle Assemblers Mohammad Sabir Sheikh said multiple price hikes had been introduced by the three Japanese bike assemblers this year citing the rupee devaluation and parts shortage.
Chinese bikes, which are relatively low priced, are facing a challenging situation due to persistent drops in their sales forcing many of them to either suspend their production or close down their plants, he said.

4,Rs370bn investment proposed for national grid expansion,"NTDC says 45pc of this investment will be used over 3 years for power evacuation projects, 43pc for removing system constraints.","ISLAMABAD: The National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) that runs the country’s national grid has sought approval for a Rs370 billion investment plan for system expansion and loss reduction over the next three years (2023-25).
In a petition to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), the transmission system operator stated that the proposed investment was required to meet the needs of an expanding transmission network with the induction of new power plants and technologies to various parts of the country, rehabilitation of existing system and need for new technologies to contain losses.
It said about 45pc (Rs167bn) of its investment would be utilised over the three years for power evacuation projects as new power plants achieve commercial operations while another 43pc (Rs158bn) investment would be used in removing system constraints through rehabilitation, upgradation and expansion of the national grid.
The remaining 12pc investment would be used equally (6pc each) for new special industrial zones of Dhabeji, Haripur, Swabi, Lahore and Faisalabad under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (Rs24bn) and protection upgradation and use of the latest equipment for system conversions like from 220kV to 500kV and so on (Rs21bn).
The company that evacuates power generation from all power plants and delivers to distribution companies across the country said it would spend a total of Rs114bn in FY23, Rs145bn in FY24 and about Rs110bn in FY25.
Of the total Rs370bn, about Rs165bn would be utilised in Punjab, followed by Rs135bn in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Rs23.5bn in Sindh and Rs12bn in Balochistan besides Rs34bn in other areas and sectors.
It said the Rs266bn investment over the previous investment period (2018-19 to 202-22) helped reduce its transmission and transformational losses from 2.9pc to 2.6pc the country was now better placed when compared to regional peers like India and Bangladesh and very close to 2.5pc in Sweden and Ukraine etc.
The performance of loss reduction in the national grid, it said, was improving consistently over the last three years and hence required additional investments to build upon the progress and to sustain.
The NTDC is required under the law to produce the transmission investment plan based on a 25-year load forecast, Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP) and the Transmission System Expansion Plan (TSEP) along with annual system reliability assessment and improvement reports.
With the use of state-of-the-art generation planning and optimisation tools and adherence to global best practices, NTDC has already submitted IGCEP 2022 – 2031 in September.
It said the performance of the NTDC system concerning losses was improving but at the same time, the marginal positive impact of NTDC projects on T&T losses was partially offset due to load growth. The average monthly net delivered energy to Discos through the national grid has increased by 25pc from FY18 to FY22.
Nepra has accepted the petition for a public hearing on Jan 2, 2023 to examine if the claimed investment of Rs370bn for a multiyear tariff control period was justified based on project-wise rationale and techno-commercial benefits to be achieved in terms of constraints removal, additional energy available for wheeling, reliability and continuity of supply, reduction in transmission losses.

5,Energy equipment distributor plans IPO,"Will use raised funds to set up offices in Gulf region, expand operations in lithium-ion batteries and EV–charging segments.","KARACHI: Energy equipment distributor NetLine Ltd plans to raise funds through the stock exchange after setting up a state-of-the-art solar panel plant in Islamabad.
Speaking to reporters at the company’s head office on Monday, NetLine Ltd Director Umair Zavary said the firm recently received a valuation of $4.5 million from Intermarket Securities, a Karachi-based brokerage house.
Based on the independent valuation, the energy equipment distributor has just concluded a Series A round in which it raised an undisclosed amount from a “leading logistics and freight company,” he added.
The Zavary family still retains a majority stake and management control in the firm, which deals in solar panels, industrial UPS, automatic voltage regulators, energy storage (batteries) and DC electrifiers.
The company will use the raised funds to set up offices in the Gulf region and expand operations in lithium-ion (rechargeable) batteries as well as electric vehicle–charging segments, Mr Zavary said.
More importantly, the company will set up a plant on a three-acre industrial estate on the outskirts of Islamabad to initially assemble solar panels at an investment of $3.5m. The number of panels produced in the first phase will be enough to generate 180 megawatts on an annual basis.
The second phase of expansion will take place by the end of 2024 in which the company will start manufacturing solar panels based on Turkish technology, he said.
“The size of investment for the second phase is going to be $5m,” he said, noting that the company is aiming for a public listing in 2024 through the exchange’s main board.
The third phase of expansion, beginning in 2026, will see an investment of $20m, he said. That’s because the final phase will involve the mining of quartz — a common mineral that’s refined to yield silicon, which is used heavily in energy equipment.
