0,Govt urged to invest in human capital,"KARACHI: Suggesting different strategies to help tackle the current economic crisis, speakers at a recently ...","KARACHI: Suggesting different strategies to help tackle the current economic crisis, speakers at a recently concluded conference urged the government to invest in human capital and make long-term policies that could only serve Pakistan’s interests.
The two-day conference was organised by the department of economics and management sciences, NED University of Engineering and Technology.
“The country has reached a point where it desperately needs support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Otherwise, it would move towards default,” former finance minister Miftah Ismail said, adding that there was not much of a problem during the three years when the government had an agreement with the funding agency.
The last two years, he said, had seen a tremendous increase in imports but reduction in exports.
“The gap between our income and expenditure has been increasing over the years. In the last financial year, we had earned $61 billion against the expenditure of $80 billion,” he said.
Favouring the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, the ex-finance minister said it guaranteed the country’s economic progress as China loaned its companies which invested in Pakistan.
Senior economist Shabbar Zaidi, who served as chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue, shared that the project was being lost to the cold war between the US and China. “We must not politicise the project as it’s not an option but rather our need. The country needs $50 billion to improve its infrastructure and address energy shortages.”
Former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Saleem Raza, told the audience how the country’s economy had degraded in the recent years.
“For the past three years, we are relying on foreign loans. The gap between food and agriculture production has increased from $2 billion to $6 billion in five years,” he said, while emphasising the need for improving the country’s relations with China.
In their remarks, Prof Sarosh Hashmat Lodi, vice chancellor of the NED university, and Prof Noman Ahmed, dean faculty of architecture and management sciences, urged the government to make sustainable long-term policies after thorough deliberation and invest in human resources.
Prof Raza Ali Khan, chairman of the department of economics and management sciences, highlighted the country’s major challenges which included ad hocism in economic policies, growing unemployment, limited production capacity and energy shortages.

1,Alvi regrets corruption in Pakistan higher than developed nations,KARACHI: President Dr Arif Alvi on Monday urged all government officials to ensure the dispensation of justice to ...,"KARACHI: President Dr Arif Alvi on Monday urged all government officials to ensure the dispensation of justice to the public and their service in its true spirit to resolve problems faced by citizens in the shortest possible time.
Addressing an awareness seminar titled ‘Roles, functions and Performance of Federal Tax Ombudsman (FTO)’ held here at Governor House, Dr Alvi said that it was among the primary duties of an ombudsman that he should expedite the process of dispensation of justice and find a way out for resolving the issues.
He said there was a need to create friendly, services-oriented, and objective tax system where every taxpayer willingly and happily follows the law and pays tax obligations without any fear of exploitation, harassment, or intimidation.
He said corruption was a menace that could not be rooted out completely from society, but it was regrettable that its proportion in our society was higher than other developed nations. 
The president also asked journalists to focus on the real intent and objectives of the statement rather than spinning the news while reporting.

2,Traders fear urban flooding again in next monsoon,HYDERABAD: Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry president Mohammad Farooq Shaikhani has said that...,"HYDERABAD: Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry president Mohammad Farooq Shaikhani has said that urban flooding had been triggered by poor sewerage system in the city and this problem remained unresolved for long. He said the next monsoon was just a few months away and no planning had apparently been seen as yet on how to deal with it in the wake this year’s massive flooding.
In a statement issued here on Monday, he said that the city’s sewerage system was not upgraded for several years. This runoff could be used for agriculture purposes to support economy on the pattern of international town planning. He said that if irrigation department and Sindh government did not handle issues of lakes and barrages, then a similar calamity could strike Sindh again.
He said that it had been seen in developed countries that administrations always discussed reasons in the wake of any disaster or calamity so that steps could be taken to avoid devastation in future.
He said despite this year’s floods, no planning was being done for the next monsoon season. 
Mr Shaikhani said that 10 gates of Sukkur and Kotri barrages remained closed due to silt accumulation that had developed like an island. 
He said that no planning was seen for resolving sewerage issue as the department concerned appeared poorly equipped. He pointed out that this wastewater could be used for earning income, and said that considering topography of Hyderabad’s biological waste would have to be diverted for treatment so that freshwater could be kept clean.
The recent unprecedented loods had displaced millions of people in Sindh and Balochistan while standing crops worth billions of rupees were lost. He said people were still reeling under the shock of the floods and businesses were affected in the two provinces.
He urged Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and other authorities to make their preparations accordingly to face next monsoon.

3,Khuhro says Centre must supply adequate gas to Sindh,Cites constitutional provision to claim Sindh’s first right on the utility,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro on Monday visited Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto to inspect the arrangements made for the expected mammoth gathering of party leaders, workers and supporters outside Bhuttos’ mausoleum to be held on Tuesday to observe the 15th death anniversary of slain prime minister Benazir Bhutto. 
He, along with local party colleagues, also took round the reception camps set up in Larkana city and its adjoining areas. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari, besides other senior party leaders, are expected to address the gathering.
Earlier, speaking to party workers at his residence, Mr Khuhro said assassination of Benazir Bhutto was a conspiracy to derail democracy and gagging people’s voice. But we [PPP] declared that “democracy is the best revenge” and saved democracy, he said. 
He observed that [then president] General Musharraf had failed to provide proper security to Benazir Bhutto and, as such, he should be tried in the assassination case. 

Cites constitutional provision to claim Sindh’s first right on the utility

Speaking about the aggravating natural gas crisis in the country, Mr Khuhro said the Constitution guaranteed first right on gas to its producer province. Therefore, the federal government must ensure adequate gas supply to Sindh. He noted that gas shortage was not only troubling domestic consumers, but was also badly affecting Industrial production. 
He held former prime minister Imran Khan responsible for the persisting economic crisis in the country, and said democratic forces were putting in efforts to improve the situation. The proposed ‘Charter of Economy’ was the need of the hour, he said, and urged all political parties sitting in the federal government to join hands in inking the charter. 
The PPP leader claimed that Pakistan and democracy were not on the agenda of Imran Khan, “who is not a patriotic person”. He accused the former PM of being supporter of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and terrorists, arguing that he was tightlipped over the ongoing series of terrorist attacks by the banned outfit and other such groups. 
Imran Khan’s desire to sit with PML-Q to hammer out an election alliance or seat adjustment deal demonstrated his weakness, Mr Khuhro said. 
Commenting on rumors about Mr Khan to become president, he said it was like building a castle in the air. 
He could only be a candidate for the slot when President Arif Alvi would resign and he [Imran Khan] proved his majority in the parliament and all provincial assemblies, he explained. “Mr Khan doesn’t have such a majority,” he said. He expressed his confidence that neither Imran Khan was going to become president of Pakistan nor would there be a technocrat government or presidential form of government in place.t

JSQM vice chairman Dr Niaz Kalani and Rawadari Tehreek chief Punhal Sariyo led the protesters, who marched from Jam Mumtaz Degree College to the main roundabout where they observed the sit-in. 
The leaders demanded justice for the youth and said that Malik who worked at the mill was killed and his body was thrown into chemical but the Ubauro police had not lodged any FIR. 
They said the mill administration had only returned dead bodies to local population instead of providing them sustained livelihood. The mill administration wanted to colour the murder as a suicide hence police had not lodged the FIR. If a murder case was not registered against the mill, they would observe a sit-it before the factory after a week, they warned. 
In another incident, the body of a 23-year-old labourer, with his head severed, was found in a flour mill near bypass area in Ghotki on Monday. 
The mill’s owner claimed that the man, Aamir Shehzad, got entangled into a machine’s belt and his head was severed.

5,‘Sindh’s infrastructure lacks strength to withstand disasters’,HYDERABAD: Social activists have urged provincial and federal governments to have proper planning to cope with...,"HYDERABAD: Social activists have urged provincial and federal governments to have proper planning to cope with natural disasters and said that Sindh needs to modify its infrastructure to better withstand calamities in future as in its existing shape it lacks strength to face heavy rainfall or flood. 
They said that Sindh government should take up its case with the federal government over the vast scale of devastation caused by heavy rainfall and floodwaters that ravaged through its plains before falling into the sea. 
They were speaking at a meeting organised by Bhitshah Declaration Coord-ination Council at Sindhi Language Authority on Monday. 
The South Asia Partne-rship (SAP) chief Mohammad Tahseen proposed an amendment to the Constitution to ensure clean environment for people. His organisation was supporting all the good work being done by Federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman, he said.  
He said that a check was necessary over the international aid pouring in Pakistan and called for making preparations for facing the climate change phenomenon. Thanks to flawed policies of developed world, countries like Pakistan were paying a heavy price, he said. 
He advised Pakistan to present a strong case on international forums and said that whenever man played with nature it struck back with fury in its own way. “We have polluted freshwater by disposing of effluent into it and deforestation has threatened the very existence of various species of birds and animals,” he said. 
Prof Ismail Kumbhar said that natural waterways had been encroached upon and if the encroachments were not removed it would lead once again to disastrous consequences. Necessary steps must be taken in the light of devastation caused by flood in Sindh, he said while making a detailed presentation on urban flooding.  
He discussed Left Bank Outfall Drain and its design fault and said the same was the issue with Right Bank Outfall Drain. About 2.5 million people were affected by this year’s devastating flood which had badly affected agriculture sector, he said. 
Abbas Khoso said that Sindh would keep suffering for many years to come due to the massive havoc wreaked by floods. If the conditions did not change in Sindh it would once again lead to dangerous situation in next season, he said. 
Journalist Ishaq Mangrio said that social activists were the first to reach flood victims after the calamity hit them and they continued their work despite all odds, which was a positive development. 
Shahnaz Sheedi, a SAP representative, said that women and children were the worst hit in floods. The provincial and federal governments should change their attitude as far as disaster mitigation was concerned, she said. 
Lala Maqbool Mashori said that Bhitshah Declara-tion Coordination Council was formed in 1991 with 24 organisations and today 132 organisations had become part of this network. This network had trained many leaders of society, he said. 
M. Parkash, Rafia Gullani, Bashir Abro, Wajid Leghari, Ali Hassan Mahesar, Madiha Shah, Javed Soz and others also spoke at the meeting.

6,Another young man shot dead by robbers over resistance in Karachi,Police say the investigation is underway.,"KARACHI: Another young man was gunned down by armed robbers over resistance in Surjani Town, police said on Monday.
They said that the incident took place late on Sunday night when Asmatullah, 27, was shot and killed during a robbery near Umer Farooq Chowrangi, Sector 50-B. 
He was intercepted by armed muggers riding on a motorbike and as soon as he offered some resistance one of them shot him and rode away.
The body was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed  Hospital to fulfil medico-legal formalities.
Meanwhile, a young man was shot dead allegedly by his friends on way home from a dance party in Baldia Town early on Monday morning, according to police.
Ittehad Town police SHO Ghulam Rasool Arbab said Rafiullah was traveling in a car when three suspects riding a motorbike opened fire on him near Eidgah ground.
The officer said the victim was a scrap dealer originally hailed from Laki Marwat in the KPK.
Suspect killed in ‘encounter’

7,Opposition in Sindh sees foul play as govt seeks ECP view over fresh delimitation,"While Sindh makes no direct request to delay Jan 15 elections, PTI, JI view it as yet another attempt to postpone LG polls.","KARACHI: In what is seen by the opposition parties as another attempt to delay the Jan 15 local government elections, the Sindh government has approached the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking its opinion for “further necessary action” on the Feb 1 verdict of the Supreme Court that directed it to make the LG system empowered, which primarily demands fresh delimitation before polling.
Sources said that the Sindh local government department last week sent a letter to the provincial election commissioner. 
The letter contained a copy of the apex court’s Feb 1 verdict and a letter of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan to the provincial administration demanding implementation of the verdict as well to devolve financial, administrative and political powers to local governments as enshrined under the Constitution as well as fresh delimitation.
However, it is the opinion of the Sindh advocate general in the LG department letter that gives credence to the stance of the MQM-P about devolving powers and fresh delimitation

While Sindh makes no direct request to delay Jan 15 elections, PTI, JI view it as yet another attempt to postpone LG polls

The sources said that the Sindh government did not make any direct request to delay the upcoming local government polls, but seeking opinion from the ECP for “further necessary action” on the SC verdict and the petition of the MQM-P regarding delimitation sparked speculations about the fate of the LG elections.
‘Feudal mindset’ 
Expressing their concerns, opposition parties referred to the past moves of the Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government that had on different pretexts tried to delay the local government polls. 
The parliamentary party leader of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in the Sindh Assembly, Khurrum Sher Zaman, called it a “feudal mindset” of the PPP government that didn’t want to devolve the power.
“They [Sindh government of the PPP] call themselves the champions of democracy, but in fact they are anti-democracy and believe in feudal system. They want to keep people of this province slave and don’t want anyone from the grass root to share the power,” he said in a statement issued on Monday.
“Enough is enough. The people of Sindh have now known the reality and the days of PPP rule in the province are numbered. We strongly condemn any move to the delay the second phase of local government elections in the province,” he said.
After multiple delays in the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions, the ECP had announced that the second phase of the polls in the two divisions of Sindh would be held on Jan 15. 
The LG polls were originally scheduled to take place on July 24. However, it was postponed twice due to unprecedented rains and flooding in the country, particularly in Sindh. The ECP on Oct 18 decided to postpone local government elections in Karachi for the third time.
‘Move aims at getting away from defeat’
Though there was no immediate reaction from the MQM-P, which filed a petition before the Sindh High Court seeking fresh delimitation before the local government polls.
However, other parties despite their concerns over the current delimitation of LG constituencies see the provincial government’s move as an excuse to “get away from defeat due to its bad governance for the past 15 years”.
“Now it’s again a test of the Election Commission and all other constitutional bodies of Pakistan,” said Jamaat-i-Islami Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman.
“The Election Commission has already announced its verdict on the same issue last month.
We have represented aspirations of Karachiites at the last month’s hearing by the Election Commission where both PPP and MQM-P opposed the local government polls in the city,” he said, adding: “The people of Karachi are witnessing this all. They are now well aware that who’s pro-democracy, pro-Karachi and who’s not.”

9,"Sindh govt again asked to withdraw appointment orders of administrators of Hyderabad, East, Korangi DMCs",KARACHI: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday once again asked the Sindh government to reverse the...,"KARACHI: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday once again asked the Sindh government to reverse the appointment of three government officers as administrators of the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC), and Karachi’s East and Korangi district municipal corporations.
The ECP through a letter asked the local government department to cancel the transfer of the administrators, including Javedur Rehman Kalwar of DMC-Korangi, Rehmatullah Shaikh of DMC-East and Muhammad Farooq of the HMC.
On Dec 19, the provincial government appointed Muhammad Farooque, Syed Shakeel Ahmed and Muhammad Sharif as the administrators of the HMC and DMC-Korangi and that of DMC-East in line with an agreement between the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P).
Appointment of the new administrators triggered a strong protest by the political parties, including Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), Jamat-i-Islami (JI), Sindh United Party and civil rights campaigners, who lodged complaints with the ECP that the three appointed officers were stated to be party loyalists.
Prior to their appointment, Mr Farooque and Mr Ahmed had been working as administrator of the Worker Model School, SITE Hyderabad, and Korangi, respectively. Mr Sharif had earlier been working as the director of charged parking at the DMC Central.
On Monday, the ECP again wrote to the local government secretary to withdraw or keep in abeyance the transfers of the three administrators, also asking him to avoid issuing further transfer and posting notification till culmination of the phase two of the local government elections.
The ECP officials said the directions to the local government secretary for not transferring the three administrators were issued for the second time after complaints were lodged by PTI Sindh president Syed Ali Haider Zaidi, JI naib emir Sindh Raja Arif Sultan Minhas and Advocate Dr Shahab Imam.
On Dec 21, the office of the provincial election commissioner in a letter addressed to the local government secretary said the ECP through a notification issued on June 10 had imposed a ban on the transfer/ posting during the conduct of local government elections.
The letter reminded the government of an earlier ECP notification that states: “For divisions in respect of which election schedule of local government elections has been issued, no transfer / posting of the government officers and officials, including those of autonomous bodies/ authorities, shall be made without prior approval of the commission till the publication of election results”.

10,Sindh police to add eyes in the sky to combat outlaws in riverine areas,Unmanned aerial vehicles to be used for surveillance and targeting criminals in katcha area of four districts.,"KARACHI: By planning to procure drone technology, the Sindh police are planning to use the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) not only for surveillance purpose but also for targeting ruthless bandits at their hideouts in riverine areas of the province.
The shift in policing is said to be because of a difficult terrain in the riverine areas of four hard-to-reach districts — Ghotki, Sukkur, Shikarpur and Kashmore — which provide safe havens to outlaws.
Analyst Mohammad Amir Rana, who is director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS), said: “Use of drone has been increased in Pakistan. Initially, this technology was used by army during Zarb-i-Azab, but now it is being used ‘extensively’ to counter urban terrorism.”
“Drones are expected to be used in katcha areas. This is a big shift in security due to changing technology of surveillance and change in operational ways,” he said. “This is a major shift in operational techniques being used by the Counter-Terrorism Department and other law enforcement agencies.”

UAVs to be used for surveillance and targeting criminals in katcha area of four districts

Senior counterterrorism official Raja Umer Khattab believed that use of drone technology has become imperative to improve security.
However, he suggested that in urban areas, this technology should be used for surveillance purpose only to avoid collateral damage, while in riverine areas, the drones should be used for both purposes of surveillance and strikes.

Options being explored, says IGP
“We are working on it and in close coordination with the suppliers of security equipment,” Sindh police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon told Dawn.
Talking about reports of procurement of drones and other sophisticated high-tech arms to meet growing challenge of dacoits in katcha areas, he said: “Police need surveillance equipment and long range sniper rifles for policing in this katcha area.”
IGP Memon added: “We have explored certain options and will place our shopping list with the government as soon as it is finalised.”
Official sources said that the Sindh government had formed a committee for procurement of arms, ammunition and security items after the killings of five police officers in Ghotki in September and it decided to procure modern technology to deal with the menace of banditry.
A letter from AIG-Logistics Dr Samiullah Soomro to Wah Industries Limited stating that the Sindh police needed “40 surveillance drones Matrix-300 night vision thermal, 30 Ababeel payload delivery/surveillance, 30 range sniper master and sniper rifle and 100,000 ammunitions, 75 thermal scope, 75 night vision scope, 75 laser range finder, 10 vehicle mounted machine guns, 20 automatic grenade launchers, 16 mortars, and four command vehicles for drones (master trucks), etc”.
An official familiar with this development told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the Sindh police sought unit cost/price estimate of each item. However, they have not received any response as it may take some time for calculation of the cost of each item.
The official said after assessing the cost involved, a summary would be moved to the chief minister for approval of funds to procure the said equipment.
He said these modern technology and weapons would be placed at disposal of four districts, which had riverine areas to be used against bandits.
Besides, the Rapid Response Force (RRF) personnel had already been dispatched there to launch a targeted operation against criminals.
Ghotki SSP Tanveer Tunio told Dawn that a significant progress had already been made to procure drones, etc.
He said: “An order has been placed and trials [of drones] have been started”. He said he had attended one trial of drones in Peshawar on Friday and another trial was expected to be held on Jan 9, 2023.
“An order has been issued, the process of procurement has been started and we are now moving towards final conclusion,” he said.
Jungle warfare — holistic approach
Karachi’s South-SSP Syed Asad Raza, who had served in Kashmore which is one of the worst districts hit by banditry and tribal feuds, said this was ‘jungle warfare’.
He said that the US had suffered badly in Vietnam War because of thick forests and trees, which were used by rebels for hiding.
Similarly, in katcha areas of Sindh, the dacoits used forests and thick trees for camouflage.
He said riverine areas were spread over hundreds of kilometres, which posed serious security challenge for police. He recalled that when he was SSP Kashmore, he had used drones privately and spent hundreds of thousands of rupees for surveillance purpose, but it had limited value as duration of drone cameras was around 45 minutes.
He suggested that surveillance drones should be complimented with high precision target drones.
The SSP added that the issue of banditry in riverine dated back to late 1970s partly because of transportation of sophisticated weapons there and host of other issues like injustice in rural areas.
He said a holistic approach was required to deal with the katcha banditry as apart from security policy, it was also needed to provide dispensation of justice in rural areas.

11,"Removal of illegal parking, bus stands from service lane, green belt ordered",KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has directed the authorities concerned to remove illegal parking of commercial...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has directed the authorities concerned to remove illegal parking of commercial vehicles, booking offices and other encroachments from service roads, greenbelts and footpaths at Sohrab Goth within 30 days.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Nadeem Akhtar asked the inspector general of police and director general of Rangers to provide adequate force and support to deputy commissioner-East and other officials concerned for removal of such encroachments.
It further ordered the IGP to ensure proper deployment of traffic police to prevent unauthorised and illegal parking of commercial vehicles on any part of such public spaces.
The bench also asked the anti-encroachment force to exercise its powers and lodge FIRs against the encroachers since encroachments on public property is a crime under the Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act 2010.
The court issued such directives on a petition filed by a traders’ association and some others against illegal bus stands, unauthorised parking and other encroachments near Al-Asif Square at Sohrab Goth.
At the outset of the hearing, DC-East Raja Tariq Hussain filed a report in compliance with earlier court orders to remove illegal encroachments and constructions from the area in question.
The DC in his report claimed that anti-encroachment operation was conducted on Dec 17 and 18, but no illegal construction/hard encroachment was found and soft encroachments in the shape of cabins of transporters etc. were removed.
The report further maintained that the encroachments in the subject area were of temporary nature made on a daily basis and suggested that DIG-traffic should be directed to ensure that commercial vehicles would not be parked on such public spaces while Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and district municipal corporation (DMC) may also be asked for plantation on greenbelts to prevent encroachments.
The DC in his report further submitted that cabins and temporary offices constructed on public spaces were being used for booking and ticketing offices for commercial vehicles and parking of such vehicles were the main cause of encroachments. The lawyer for petitioners in a statement also submitted that the encroachment has re-emerged on the subject property.
The bench observed that obviously, the subject public spaces were under encroachments and the same were always reappeared whenever such encroachments were removed.
It further noted that the public property meant for use, enjoyment and benefit of public and cannot be used or occupied by any person or authority while government, municipal authorities and their functionaries were duty-bound to keep such spaces free from all types of encroachments and claims.
The bench further said that encroaching up public property was a crime against public and keeping in view several judgements of the Supreme Court about protection of public properties from misuse and encroachment, all officials, respondents, executives and judicial authorities including the SHC were bound under Article 190 to act in aid of the orders of the apex courts.
“Accordingly, all the respondents are jointly and severally directed to restore the entire subject public property viz. service roads, greenbelts and footpaths to their original and actual position as per the master plan, by ensuring that all types of encroachments are removed therefrom without fail within thirty (30) days, and by further ensuring that that the entire said public property remains free from all types of encroachments in future”, it added.
While adjourning the hearing till Jan 31, the bench directed the DC to be in attendance at next hearing with compliance report and also asked the lawyer for petitioners to implead KMC and DMC among the respondents and file the amended title of petition within seven days and then court’s office will issue notices to the newly-added respondents to file comment before next hearing.
