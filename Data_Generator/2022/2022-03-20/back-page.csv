0,Zelensky calls for fresh talks as Russia fires hypersonic missiles,"“This is the time to meet, to talk, time for renewing territorial integrity and fairness for Ukraine,"" says the president.","KYIV: Russia on Saturday admitted using advanced hypersonic missiles for the first time in the Ukraine conflict as Kyiv’s embattled leader Volodymyr Zelensky called for urgent peace talks a day after the Ukrainian authorities claimed to have killed a Russian general by a strike on an airfield. 
Moscow also claimed its troops had broken Ukrainian defences to enter the strategic southern port city of Mariupol and destroyed radio and intelligence sites just outside Odessa, as Ukrainian authorities on Saturday admitted they had “temporarily” lost access to the Sea of Azov.
Russia said it used the Kinzhal (Dagger) high-precision hypersonic missile, which can elude most defence systems, to destroy an arms depot in Deliatyn, a village near the border with Romania, on Friday. Moscow had never before admitted using the state-of-the-art missile in the combat.
“The enemy targeted our depots” but “we have no information of the type of missile,” Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuri Ignat told AFP. “There has been damage, destruction and the detonation of munitions,” he said. “They are using all the missiles in their arsenal against us.”

‘Time to meet, talk’
In a Facebook video, Zelensky said: “This is the time to meet, to talk, time for renewing territorial integrity and fairness for Ukraine. Otherwise, Russia’s losses will be such that several generations will not recover.” 
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss accused Moscow of using the talks as a “smokescreen” as it carried out “appalling atrocities”, saying she was “very sceptical” they would produce a breakthrough.
As Putin’s ground offensive has met with fierce resistance, Moscow has increasingly turned to indiscriminate air and long-range strikes. Friday’s attack on the arms depot was the latest strike in western Ukraine, which until a few days ago had remained relatively unscathed by Russia’s push toward key cities from the north and east.
On Friday, Russian forces destroyed an aircraft repair plant near the airport of Lviv, where millions of people have fled as rockets and shelling continue to rain down on Kyiv.
In Mariupol, rescuers were still searching for hundreds of people trapped under the wreckage of a bombed theatre where over 1,000 people had been seeking shelter.
More than 3.25 million refugees have fled Ukraine and countless others have sought havens in the country’s west, though Putin said his forces were doing everything possible to avoid civilian casualties during his latest call with Macron, according to the Kremlin.
Russia’s ally China told US President Joe Biden on Friday that the war was “in no one’s interest,” but showed no sign of giving in to US pressure to join Western condemnation of Russia. Biden warned his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping of “consequences” for any financial or military aid for Russia, a move that could turn the standoff into a global confrontation.
Talks stall
In a call to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Putin accused Ukrainian authorities of stalling talks by “putting forward more and more unrealistic proposals”.
Russia wants Ukraine to disarm and disavow all Western alliances, in particular by joining Nato or seeking closer integration with the European Union — steps that Kyiv says would turn it into a vassal state of Moscow.
Russia’s top negotiator said Friday that Moscow and Kyiv had brought their positions “as close as possible” on a proposal for Ukraine to become a neutral state. But Mikhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelensky taking part in the negotiations, said his country’s position had not budged.
Cosmonauts in yellow and blue
Meanwhile, three Russian cosmonauts arrived at the International Space Station wearing yellow flight suits with blue accents, colours that appeared to match the Ukrainian flag. 
The men were the first new arrivals on the space station since the start of the Russian war in Ukraine last month.
Russian space corporation Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveyev and Sergey Korsakov blasted off successfully from the Russia-leased Baikonur launch facility in Kazakhstan in their Soyuz MS-21 spacecraft on Friday night and smoothly docked at the station just over three hours later, joining two Russians, four Americans and a German on the orbiting outpost.
Video of Artemyev taken as the spacecraft prepared to dock with the space station showed him wearing a blue flight suit. It was unclear what, if any, message the yellow uniforms they changed into were intended to send.
When the cosmonauts were able to talk to family back on Earth, Artemyev was asked about the suits. He said every crew chooses their own.

1,Baptised Catholic women can head Vatican depts: pope,"Most Vatican departments have been headed by male clerics, usually cardinals.","VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis on Saturday issued a new constitution for the Vatican’s central administration, known as the Curia, stating that any baptized lay Catholic, including women, can head Vatican departments.
Most Vatican departments have been headed by male clerics, usually cardinals. 
The new, 54-page constitution, called Praedicate Evangelium (Preach the Gospel), took more than nine years to complete. It will take effect on June 5, replacing the one approved in 1988 by Pope John Paul II.
One part of the preamble of the constitution says: “The pope, bishops and other ordained ministers are not the only evangelizers in the Church,” adding that lay men and women “should have roles of government and responsibility”.
The principles section of the constitution says “any member of the faithful can head a dicastery (Curia department) or organism” if the pope decides they are qualified and appoints them. It makes no distinction between lay men and lay women.
The 1988 constitution stated that departments were to be headed a cardinal or a bishop and assisted by a secretary, experts and administrators.
In an interview with Reuters in 2018, the pope disclosed he had shortlisted a woman to head a Vatican economic department but she could not take the job for personal reasons.
Last year, Francis for the first time named a woman to the number two position in the governorship of Vatican City, making Sister Raffaella Petrini the highest-ranking woman in the world’s smallest state.
Also last year, he named Italian nun Sister Alessandra Smerilli to the interim position of secretary of the Vatican’s development office, which deals with justice and peace issues.
In addition, Francis named Nathalie Becquart, a French member of the Xaviere Missionary Sisters, as co-undersecretary of the Synod of Bishops, a department that prepares major meetings of world bishops held every few years.

2,China reports first Covid deaths in over a year,China is maintaining a “dynamic clearance” approach that aims to cut transmission as soon as possible using stringent measures.,"SHANGHAI: Mainland China reported its first Covid-19 deaths in more than a year on Saturday, according to a post on the National Health Commission’s website that said two people died in the northeastern region of Jilin.
China reported only two Covid deaths for all of 2021, the last on January 25.
The country is maintaining a “dynamic clearance” approach, which aims to cut transmission as soon as possible, using stringent measures such as short and targeted shutdowns and quick testing schemes where cases are found.
Jilin, bordering North Korea and Russia, accounts for more than two-thirds of domestic infections in this wave. One of the dead was an elderly person of unspecified age, the other over 60, said Jiao Yahui, a senior official with the National Health Commission. The direct cause of death was their underlying diseases, Jiao told reporters in Beijing, while their Covid symptoms were mild.
More than 95 per cent of the nearly 30,000 people hospitalised with Covid had mild or no symptoms, Jiao said.
The latest deaths raised the toll to 4,638. China reported 2,228 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Friday, down from 2,416 a day earlier.
Of the new cases, 2,157 were locally transmitted, compared with 2,388 a day earlier, with 78pc appearing in Jilin and others found in the southeastern province of Fujian and the southern province of Guangdong, among others.
The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, stood at 1,823, compared with 1,904 a day earlier. As of Friday, mainland China had confirmed 128,462 cases of confirmed cases.
The first deaths in more than a year quickly caught the social media spotlight. “Two new COVID deaths in Jilin” was a top trending topic on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform, with many expressing a desire for more information on the two victims.
