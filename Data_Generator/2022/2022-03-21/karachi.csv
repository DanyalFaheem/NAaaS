0,Moot on patient safety calls for moving towards medical home care,PM’s aide Dr Sultan says 20pc to 40pc of health spending wasted due to poor quality care...,"KARACHI: The 5th international conference on patient safety concluded at the Liaquat National Hospital (LNH) on Sunday with messages for moving towards people-centred care and increased use of technology to tackle growing healthcare challenges and burden on hospitals.
The event —Implementation research in healthcare quality and safety — was organised by Riphah Institute of Healthcare Improvement & Safety in partnership with World Health Organisation, Imperial College London, City University London, National Institute of Health, Islamabad and Martin Dow Group.
The conference covered topics ranging from infection prevention and control, patient safety in dentistry, role of nursing, implementation of health policies and research, to leadership in healthcare, pharmacovigilance and the role of virtual reality in surgical training.
In his recorded message, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Faisal Sultan explained why it’s important to focus on patient safety. “This is a serious health issue requiring our immediate attention. Better safety measures improve patient experience, health outcomes, well-being of the healthcare team as well as reduce costs,” he said.

PM’s aide Dr Sultan says 20pc to 40pc of health spending wasted due to poor quality care

Globally, Dr Sultan pointed out, 20 per cent to 40pc of health spending went wasted due to poor quality care and 15pc of hospital costs were on account of harm caused to patients.
“These statistics remind us that patient safety is critical in healthcare. In Pakistan, we need to move towards people-centred care, while paying attention to public health needs and expectations of the community to improve patient safety.”
He appreciated efforts on part of the event organisers and said discussions on the forum would encourage stakeholders to take practical measures in this field.
AI transforming healthcare future
In a session on the future of healthcare, LNH medical director Dr Salman Faridi said artificial intelligence was transforming the future of healthcare as it provided several advantages over traditional clinical decision-making.
On medical error reduction and prevention, he said chances of errors during treatment always existed and like other professionals, doctors should also be forgiven for the error.
In his presentation, Dr Zakiuddin said there was an immediate need to introduce the concept of ‘homspital’ in society where patients were provided healthcare services at home.
“There are several factors in play leading to the emergence of a new hospital structure. These forces include changes in patient population and their needs, advances in clinical knowledge and technology, impact of digital technology, higher patient expectation, difficulties in attracting and retaining an appropriate skilled workforce, financial and funding challenges and growing requirements to measure quality.”
Sharing some data on digital medical / health applications, he said their numbers were increasing rapidly. “Currently, we have 300,000 apps on iOS and Android compared to the approximately 165,000 available in 2015.”
Dr Zakiuddin concluded his presentation by emphasising that doctors and nurses were facing burnouts and to prevent them, the phenomenon of ‘homspital’ should be introduced as soon as possible.
Sindh Health Minister Azra Fazal Pechuho, Prof Paul Barach of Wayne State University, Dr Aziz Sheikh from the University of Edinburgh and Prof Allen Meador from the University of North Carolina, were among the speakers.

2,This week 50 years ago: Teachers’ agitation and warning against provincialism,THE early retirement of the city’s teachers had sparked off a fierce agitation from both the teaching community ...,"THE early retirement of the city’s teachers had sparked off a fierce agitation from both the teaching community and students. It had begun to give a troublesome time to Karachi’s administration. On March 21, 1972 this newspaper reported that the government school teachers’ protest against the ‘premature’ retirement of teachers and educationist under MLR 114 continued for the third day (March 20) to press the authorities for reinstatement of teachers and educationists. 
The Government Schools Teachers Association staged a protest at the Directorate of Education (Old Sindh Assembly building), which was sealed by them on March 17. 
Several attempts made by the deputy magistrate and the superintendent of police to persuade them to open the seal had failed until 2pm. The teachers staged a sit-in and remained at the directorate until 2pm, after which they dispersed when almost the entire staff of the directorate had gone home. 
The students entered the fray by ‘occupying’ some of the institutions. On March 22, the senior students of Government College Nazimabad conducted regular classes on the second day of their ‘occupation’ of the institution as a protest against early retirement of their principal. Although the college was officially closed, the attendance was good and the seniors took classes to the satisfaction of the students. 
The students of Dow Medical College, too, continued to demand reinstatement of their three professors, who had been forcibly retired. Similarly, the students at the Institute of Business Administration, NED Engineering College (which had been occupied on March 21) and D J College carried on with the protest. 
Staying on the subject of students and in order to point out how far back the problem of provincialism goes in our country, on March 23, Kassim Haji Abbas Patel, the Provincial Minister for Industries and Mineral Development, warned all sections of people in general and students in particular against provincial and parochial feelings propagated by a section of the defeated and disgruntled politicians. He was addressing the youngsters at the 20th annual college book distribution function of the Students Welfare Organisation as part of Pakistan Day observance at Khaliqdina Hall. He added nobody would be spared if found guilty of disturbing peace in the city. 
In other news, which was not good either, the security issue was highlighted when on March 21, 170 Bengalis were arrested for trying to leave Pakistan illegally by two launches. A number of such cases had been detected in the recent past. It was suspected that many more might have succeeded in their attempts undetected. 
These days, we seldom hear about syces (stable hands) who work for the Race Club. Fifty years back, they had a strong voice as well. On March 25, some 600 syces working in various stables at the Karachi Race Club went on a lightning strike to press for better wages and working conditions. They marched from the course to Governor’s House in order to inform the governor, Mumtaz Bhutto, about their grievances. The syces observed a two-hour sit-down strike. Later, the governor met with their representatives and assured them that their demands would be considered.

On the occasion, classical dancer, social activist and founder of cultural action group Tehrik-i-Niswan Sheema Kermani read her paper titled ‘The unsung heroine’. “People always write about history of men in the Hur Movement, but doing so they forget that there was also an active participation of women and girls there,” she said.  
Lawyer and writer Javed Qazi said that he had studied the Hur Movement and learnt that Soreh Badshah or Pir Sibghatullah Shah was a real hero. “He was a freedom fighter,” he added.  
Journalist and women’s rights activist Hameeda Ghangroo said she felt sad when people read fake history. Sardar Rahim of PML-F and ex-IG Aftab Nabi also spoke.

5,PPP can gather two million people in Islamabad: Khuhro,LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro has said that his party will pay Imran Khan in ...,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro has said that his party will pay Imran Khan in the same coin and if he tries to gather one million people in Islamabad PPP can assemble two million on the day. 
Khuhro said at a press conference at Larkana Press Club on Sunday that speaker of National Assembly had acted unconstitutionally by convening session on March 25. 
The opposition had submitted requisition on March 8 after which he was to convene the session within 14 days but if voting on no-confidence motion was not carried out on the date and attempt was made to impose governor’s rule in Sindh, it would prove disastrous, he warned. 
He said the speaker could not prorogue the session without going ahead with no-trust motion the day the session was convened. By holding the session late, the prime minister had attempted to make the speaker a scapegoat, he said. 
He dismissed claims of international conspiracy behind the no-confidence move and said that parliament itself was all powerful to decide about the fate of its prime minister.
Khuhro said that certain PTI members were served with notices for merely not attending the party session and said they could not be disqualified before exercising their vote in favour of opposition’s move. 
He said the government had adopted the strategy to hold public meeting on the day of the no-trust vote to threaten their members with the presence of charged crowd before whom they would have to walk to the assembly and return. It spoke volumes that PTI was short of required numbers, he said.
About possible PPP-MQM alliance, Khuhro argued that PPP had forged alliance with the party in 1988 and 2008 as well and it made no difference if it did it again. However, PPP had reservations over MQM’s stand on integrity of Sindh and demand for new province, he said. 
Reservations over implementation on 40:60 formula in jobs and resources would be sorted out, he said and challenged ruling party to impose governor’s rule in Sindh. It was a mere ‘dream’ after the 18th Amendment, he said. 
He spoke about fissures in the PTI and claimed that currently there were four groups in the party while its allies had taken a clear stand over no-confidence motion. 
He said in a sarcastic tone it was all right when members were brought on planes in 2018 election, but the same were now being branded ‘turncoats’ and traitors’ when they were not ready to stand by Imran Khan.

6,Literati launch Riffat Abbas novel at foothill of Karoonjhar,"MITHI: Eminent writers, poets and men of letters arrived from different parts of the country at the foothills of...","MITHI: Eminent writers, poets and men of letters arrived from different parts of the country at the foothills of Karoonjhar in Nagarparkar town the other day to launch Seraiki poet and writer Riffat Abbas’ famous novel Namak ka jeewan ghar. 
Human rights activist and writer Amar Sindhu said the novel had been beautifully written about a land where there was no religion, inhabitants had no idea of any supreme metaphysical authority and in the absence of belief in such an authority, they hadn’t built a political system that entrusted all powers to a single authoritarian figure.  
“As there is no king, there is no accumulation of wealth, nor palaces, huge castles, of course, there are no armies hence no conflicts, no wars within and without. As there are no wars and no bloodshed, there are no violent deaths,” she remarked.  
“What people with ordinary level of thinking and logic fail to imagine, the genre of fiction easily does,” she said. 
She lauded Abbas’ work and said that such novels or fictions were the need of the hour and urged participants to read such literature.  
“Abbas employs the word namak (salt) instead of commonly used matti (clay) to signify indigeneity, clearly no overt or covert effort has been made to belittle or diminish the significance of earthly traits of the culture portrayed in the novel,” she said. 
Ali Dost Aijiz, well-known Sindhi poet, said: “A good novel like this unlocks doors to new worlds and realms of our existence that we keep disregarding under pressure of our society and daily, busy routines”.  
Khalil Kumbhar, poet and chief organiser of the book launch event, said: “At first glance the concept of a city without religion, war and death appears to be a work of a Utopian mind. But as we go through the novel, we come to realise that Abbas seeks to reclaim indigenous cultural soul ravaged by foreign invaders, left floundering under the colonisers’ oppressive narratives. 
“Though the thrust of his Seraiki poetry is charged with retrieval of the indigeneity, he has found the genre of novel more powerful in this regard and resonance of a similar theme can be traced in his poetry as well,” said Ishaq Samejo, poet and writer.   
Khalid Kumbhar said that Riffat had been at the forefront when the very existence of Karoonjhar hills was put in danger due to granite extraction a few months back.  
Riffat Abbas, the author, said that it was a matter of great pride for him that his literary labour was being praised at the foothills of Karoonjhar that had always attracted him and remained an important factor behind his poetic and prose work.  
Shabir Soomro, Mir Hassan Arisar, Khalil Khoso, Piyaro Shivani, Partab Shivani, Allah Rakhio Khoso, Changez and others also spoke at the ceremony.

8,Experts advise preventive measures against diarrhoea outbreak in Sindh,KARACHI: Amid frequent reports of cases of gastroenteritis in hospitals in Karachi and other parts of Sindh on a...,"KARACHI: Amid frequent reports of cases of gastroenteritis in hospitals in Karachi and other parts of Sindh on a daily basis, health professionals and experts asked the authorities on Sunday to create awareness among people about prevention of food and waterborne diseases to minimise the number of deaths. 
They said that public sector health facilities were under an immense pressure as hundreds of people, including children, suffering from acute gastroenteritis were brought every day. 
They asked the authorities concerned and corporate sector to allocate funds for research on gastrointestinal diseases, waterborne ailments and blood-borne infections, including viral hepatitis for effective and comprehensive medical solutions against such epidemics. 
They were speaking at a ceremony of signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the Pak GI and Liver Disease Society (PGLDS) and a local pharmaceutical firm for the launch of ‘PGLDS Research Awards’ to be given to 10 top researchers for their papers in the field of gastroenterology during the forthcoming annual conference of the society in June 2022. 
The senior gastroenterologists also advised people to take precautionary measures by drinking clean water and avoiding uncooked food from roadside vendors. 
“There is an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in Karachi and other cities of Sindh and hundreds of patients, including children, are being brought to hospitals for the treatment. 
“Watery diarrhoea was a serious health issue which could take life of a healthy person within hours if immediate medical treatment was not provided to the patient,” said Prof Amanullah Abbasi, a senior gastroenterologist associated with the PGLDS, while speaking at the MoU signing ceremony. 
He claimed that the research conducted by Pakistani experts also helped the world in understanding Covid-19 as dozens of papers on signs and symptoms of the coronavirus and its management were published in international journals. 
He urged the government and private sector to come forward and provide more funds for research in common health issues, including gastrointestinal disorders and waterborne diseases in Pakistan. 
Atif Iqbal, managing director of High-Q (the local pharmaceutical firm which is providing funds for the research in the field of gastroenterology, said that in addition to funding, they were going to import latest technology and artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions for the detection of gastrointestinal disorders in Pakistan. 
“But we also need to conduct research locally to come up with our own solutions to the problems facing our people. We at High-Q believe in promoting research and would provide all the resources to the young doctors and postgraduate fellows,” Mr Iqbal said. The awards would encourage and promote the culture of research in the field of gastroenterology and other areas of medical profession in the country, he added. 
PGLDS patron Dr Shahid Ahmed informed that 10 young researchers would be awarded cash prizes for their research in the field of gastroenterology at the 4th annual conference of the society being held in June 2022 in Karachi. 
Young doctors and trainees from regional countries and other parts of the world could also submit their papers for the research awards, he said. 
Renowned gastroenterologist Dr Lubna Kamani deplored that due to inexperience and extremely busy hours, most of the young Pakistani health physicians were unaware of the art of medical writing.

11,Ex-FC man who shot three cops in Karachi killed in encounter,"""The deceased was a retired sepoy of the Frontier Constabulary. He was currently employed as a watchman in Defence,"" says SSP","KARACHI: A retired Frontier Constabulary man was killed in an encounter after he shot at and wounded three policemen, including an SHO, in Quaidabad on Sunday, police said.
Malir SSP Irfan Bahadur said that Constable Faisal alias Nadeem lived near Daud Chowrangi and when he reached home after finishing his duty his neighbour Ahmed informed him that his father, Majeed Hameed, had been threatening neighbours with a pistol and asked him to try and talk some sense into his father along with him.

12,"Depression, stress on the rise among Karachi youth, say researchers","Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues, experts say.","KARACHI: A latest scientific study, which is part of a world-level publication, has found that levels of depression, anxiety and stress are growing mainly among the young population of Karachi.
The impact of Covid-19 pandemic has further worsened the psychological situation as in some cases the number of people suffering from such conditions has increased by 40 per cent.
The facts emerged in the data collected through a scientific research being conducted by the NED University of Engineering and Technology that had studied more than 3,000 individuals at its Neurocomputation Lab, which is one of the nine facilities set up under the National Centre of Artificial Intelligence (NCAI).
The study, experts believe, would help devise new modified strategies on diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues.
“We carried out the study on 3,000 individuals,” said Dr Muhammad Abul Hasan, associate professor at the biomedical engineering department of NED University.

Study conducted by NED University’s AI lab on 3,000 individuals will help treat mental issues

He said: “In post-Covid scenario we have found that issues of anxiety and stress have increased between 35pc to 40pc after the pandemic hit the country. This increase of percentage has been found among those who are suffering from mild and moderate psychological issues. 
“The alarming thing is that we have also recorded extreme and severe cases and in this category we have found that 28pc cases of depression have increased followed by 27pc in anxiety and 22pc in stress,” Dr Hasan said.
Despite being an engineering university, the institution was working in fields of neurosciences and neuropsychology, where the teams of researchers were exploring ‘neurological biomarkers’ of mental health, he added.
The part of the study, he said, also required that how all these biomarkers after being identified could be reversed.
Explaining neurological biomarkers, Dr Hasan, who is also the co-principal investigator at the Neuro Computation Lab, said: “Whenever we go through any psychological problem, it changes the brain patterns. There are regions in the brain. These regions have connections among them. After any psychological problem, these connections receive the impact. They may get stronger or in some cases weaker. Sometimes they disappear and sometimes new connections emerge. So basically we study these connections and analyse that they can be reversed.”
The experts believe once the research is compiled and becomes part of a global study, it would be a big achievement of Pakistani researchers, who are leading the exercise with international collaboration of the University of Glasgow, Stanford University, the Monash University Australia and the Denmark Technological University under the NCAI programme.
Vision 2025
The NCAI is the technological initiative of the federal government under its ‘Vision 2025’.
The centre is designed to become a leading hub of innovation, scientific research, knowledge transfer to the local economy, and training in the area of AI and its closely affiliated fields.
The aim of the centre is to facilitate researchers in the field of AI; help them establish and grow AI industry following international trends and seek solutions to the indigenous problems through AI.
Approved in January 2018, the NCAI is designed on a consortium model where the most leading researchers in the field of AI are identified on competitive grounds and new state-of-the-art laboratories are established under their supervision. 
As research on the mental health issues in the wake of post-pandemic scenario enters the final phase, it has raised the hopes of researchers and experts that it would go a long way both for medical science professionals and health scientists.
‘Replace traditional treatment’
“The technology has two roles when it comes to health sciences,” said Dr Saad Ahmed Qazi, dean of faculty of computer engineering at the NED University.
“One is about diagnostic, where it helps you finding timely and accurate health issues and problems. The other is about remedial action. In technology, there are several neuro-modulation techniques, which can be used for effective and durable treatment.”
He said the university’s study would help replace the traditional way of treatment in mental health and it would gradually make things easy both for the medical science professionals and people suffering from such conditions.
“In mental health issues we largely see the counselling as one of the key tools for treatment. So we can say that it [technology] gives you an opportunity to go a step forward from the conventional way of treatment and here we can capitalise on the benefits of the technology which ultimately benefits a common man,” said Dr Qazi.

13,Parsis celebrate Nauroz in city,"KARACHI: Although all Zoroastrians or Parsis celebrate Nauroz, the Persian New Year observed precisely at the time ...","KARACHI: Although all Zoroastrians or Parsis celebrate Nauroz, the Persian New Year observed precisely at the time of the spring equinox (at 20:33:26 in Karachi on Sunday this year), the traditional Nauroz table is usually laid out by those among them who originally hail from Iran.
That is also why this festival is known as ‘Jamshedi Nauroz’, after King Jamshed of Persia, who is known to have introduced the solar calculation in the Persian calendar. 
Normally, a Nauroz table will have the usual seven things starting with the letter ‘S’. These may include sabzeh (wheat sprouts), saib (apple), sikah (coins), sirka (vinegar), shakar (sugar), sheer (milk), shehed (honey), etc. Also there is a mirror on the table signifying reflecting over the past as well as light, eggs with painted shells, which signify fertility as the wheat sprouts signify rebirth. Along with this there is a goldfish also signifying life and good luck. 



 
Tushna Patel, Pakistan’s first female rally driver, is one such Parsi who has her roots in Iran. But this year Nauroz was observed in a simple manner by Tushna, her husband Ronnie and daughter Dina. Tushna had lost her father Jhanbux Bamji on Feb 10. In fact, they were not even in Karachi at the difficult time as they were in Cholistan for the jeep rally happening there at the time. 
“He got unwell and passed away before we could reach Karachi,” Tushna shares her sadness with Dawn.
Still they observed the festival. “We never break our tradition of setting the Nauroz table, but in case there is a death in the family and they are in mourning, they don’t put the sweets or the mirror on the table and keep it as simple as possible with only the necessary things,” informs Tushna, who also placed her late father’s photograph and some fresh flowers on her table this time. After all, the festival also happens to be an occasion to remember family members who have passed on and ask for their blessings. 
She also said that just like Eid for Muslims, the first festival after the passing of a family member is also a time for relatives to visit the morning family for condolences.

Young Jokhi was found murdered at a Malir farmhouse of Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Jam Awais on November 3 last year.
His brother Afzal Jokhio nominated the MPA, his elder brother MNA Jam Abdul Karim, their servants and guards in the murder case stating that Nazim earned their ire as he stopped some foreign guests from hunting houbara bustard.
On March 14, victim’s widow Shireen had filed an application before Judicial Magistrate (Malir) Altaf Hussain Tunio submitting that the incumbent court had returned a final report/charge sheet filed by the IO and ordered him on Feb 8 to submit the same before the administrative judge of the ATCs.
The IO filed an application before the magistrate submitting that as the court had ruled that the case fell within the ambit of ‘terrorism’, he had approached the administrative judge of the ATCs to submit the record and proceedings (R&P) of the case.
He submitted that the administrative judge had refused to accept the R&P of the case observing that the same would not be accepted until the charge sheet was filed by the Sindh prosecutor general (PG), Sindh.
The IO undertook to get the charge sheet pending with the office of the prosecutor general for want of scrutiny.
He maintained that the charge sheet along with PG’s scrutiny note and R&Ps of the case would be submitted to the administrative judge and requested for one-week to do the same.
Accepting the request, the magistrate granted him seven days to obtain the documents and submit the same before the administrative judge of the ATCs.

The fresh determination was demonstrated in a rally in Laasi Goth, Malir on Sunday, where the participants vowed to continue their struggle for ‘Naya Pakistan’ and described the founder of their party as the only hope for a prosperous and corruption-free Pakistan. 
Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh told the rally that PM Khan emerged as the leader of Ummah as he has raised the issue of Namoos-i-Risalat (PBUH) on all international forums and played a pivotal role in approval and passage of a historic resolution against Islamophobia in the United Nations.
He said he was the leader who had given Pakistan a sovereign and independent foreign policy by saying ‘absolutely not’ on a question of handing over air bases to a foreign power. 
The people of Sindh in a large numbers are ready to depart for the federal capital and caravans of over 1,000 vehicles are being prepared while a train is booked as well, he announced. 
“It is so unfortunate that Sindh House in Islamabad is being used for horse-trading, which creates a negative perception of Sindh across the country and caused embarrassment to the people of the province,” said Mr Sheikh. 
Protest at estranged MNA Kumar’s house 
Meanwhile, PTI workers staged a protest demonstration outside the residence of disgruntled party MNA Ramesh Kumar. 
Carrying placards and party flags, they chanted slogans and warned the MNA about public reaction against his decision to vote against PM Khan in the upcoming no-confidence resolution. 
Led by PTI MPAs Saeed Afridi, Shabbir Qureshi and Shahnawaz Jadoon, the PTI workers said they would welcome Mr Kumar back into the party folds if he reviewed his fresh decision.
