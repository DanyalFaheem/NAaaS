0,Finding and filling health  gaps digitally,"While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a...","“A man was having severe heart problems in Loralai, Balochistan,” narrates Dr Sara Saeed Khurram, co-founder of Sehat Kahani. “It was during the peak of the pandemic when the country was under lockdown and access to medical advice, tricky at the best of times in remote areas of Pakistan, had become all the more challenging. But he was able to connect to a doctor through Sehat Kahani and got prescribed the required medicine that helped save his life.”
With a ratio of one doctor for every 1,200 patients, half the population of Pakistan does not have access to basic primary healthcare services. Hand-in-hand is the phenomenon of doctor bahus: women who train medically but for a myriad of reasons are unable to practice in a country that desperately needs more doctors.
Born out of Dr Khurram’s personal experience, Sehat Kahani is a health tech social enterprise that provides a solution to both problems. “I was practicing when I had to shift cities. By chance, I connected to the nurse on duty at my old desk who told me patients were still coming to the clinic but no doctor was available. I started consulting on the phone and eventually got a webcam. Over time the chance encounter evolved into Sehat Kahani,” says Dr Khurram.
Operating through a network of 37 clinics, to date Sehat Kahani has offered 850,000 consultations and employs 7,000 doctors of which 85 per cent are females.

While various startups addresses a spectrum of challenges, till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan

According to the global health security index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 130 out of 195. From being able to access medical advice to the purchase of genuine medicine to recognising the presence of a disease, there are challenges across the entire process. Digitisation has stepped in to address many of the gaps of which Sehat Kahani is a case in point.
“We have saved six people from committing suicide in Pakistan,” says Syed Naseh, CTO of Saaya Health, a mental health platform. Available in seven languages globally and Urdu, Punjabi, Pashto and Sindhi in Pakistan, Saaya Health has conducted over 4,000 counselling sessions and its social-emotional learning content has reached about 100,000 children.
One in four people in Pakistan suffer from mental health issues. In Karachi, where multi-generational families live in small apartments, one in three suffer from depression and anxiety. And yet, there is a taboo around mental health with those seeking it as perceived to be ‘mad’, explains COO Alizeh Valjee who has a background in psychology.
During the pandemic, relationship issues were exacerbated, increasing domestic violence. The rate of disability and dysfunction increased in those with existing mental health issues along with burnout rates. Stress related to financial insecurities, rise in unemployment and poverty, lack of access to social support and recreational outlets, inability to access the health system during the lockdown and overall anxiety due to uncertainty together made an environment highly conducive to debilitating mental health and holistic wellbeing.
But things are improving, says Mr Naseh. Mental health is becoming less of a taboo, more literature is being produced and more universities are offering psychology cases, he said while giving the example of the recently held Karachi Wellness Festival.
However, all access to healthcare becomes meaningless if the medicines bought to address the illnesses are fake. And Pakistan’s problems with counterfeit drugs is endemic, with some research statistics indicating that 40-50pc of medicine sold are fake.
“We are trying to connect the pharma companies directly to the patient to help eliminate fake medicines from the system,” says Furquan Kidwai, founder and CEO of online pharmacy Dawaai.
There are 500-plus pharmaceutical companies in the country that are manufacturing drugs distributed by 1000-plus distributors through 45,000-plus licensed pharmacies, he explains using numbers to explain how fragmented the market is. This has resulted in the creation of many layers between the pharma company and the end consumer that has allowed one of the biggest counterfeit medicine markets in the world to flourish.
Because of the cryogenic nature of the market, there are about 20,000 unique SKUs (stock-taking units) available for about 500-600 medicines — each medicine is sold under 10-15 different names. “Take Paracetamol as an example. It is sold under 30 different names — Panadol, Paramol, Parasol etc,” he says.
An average shop has say about 200 SKUs so patients have to go through the hassle of visiting multiple pharmacies to get their prescription fulfilled. The pandemic pushed Dawaai’s user adoption rate to 5x-6x, leading to a current growth rate of 9x. 
The health tech numbers are impressive. One source says there are 331 health tech startups in Pakistan, another says telehealth companies grew by 900pc during the pandemic. But this picture is skewed. While various health tech addresses a spectrum of challenges, from menstrual health to setting up appointments with doctors, the ease of access is limited to the relatively affluent that have access to the internet and a basic understanding of technology. Till the net is cast wider and deeper, health tech will not be a panacea for all healthcare problems in Pakistan.

1,Looking towards the small guy,"There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot","

Mr Song Song, Country Manager, Ali Baba

 
For as long as one can remember, Pakistan has been stuck in a perpetual cycle of boom and busts. Ask any minister, finance bro or stock analyst masquerading as an economist the recipe to break free from this and they will tell you increasing exports is the answer. That’s also something Commerce Advisor Abdul Razak Dawood has made a key priority since the first day. 
One such measure his ministry could claim credit for was getting Pakistan placed on the Amazon’s sellers’ list, which we were told would open new avenues for exports for local entrepreneurs. How many of those businesses, mostly used to business-to-business (B2B )contracts, would actually be able to position themselves in the direct-to-consumer (D2C) segment on arguably the most competitive marketplace on the planet was a different matter altogether. 

There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot

Meanwhile, a few thousand businesses from the country had focused their energies eastward towards Alibaba.com. In fact, Pakistan now ranks the highest in terms of paid sellers on the world’s largest B2B e-commerce platform’s Global Business. Since 2017-18, the number of Pakistani sellers on the platform has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 29 per cent, according to a presentation the company presented to a roundtable at the Board of Investment’s recent conference. 
“There are more than 3,000 Pakistani sellers on Alibaba.com with close to 90pc of them coming from Sialkot,” says Mr Song Song, the company’s country manager for Pakistan. And now he wants to expand the platform’s reach to traders and businesses in other cities, especially the export-oriented ones like Faisalabad and Gujranwala, in addition to Karachi and Lahore. For that purpose, he and his team have been increasing their outreach efforts through awareness sessions at the various chambers of commerce and industries. 
“Apparel is the most popular category among Pakistani sellers, followed by sports goods and surgical equipment given that the majority of our users are from Sialkot,” he shares. According to the ‘Digital B2B Outlook 2022 Pakistan’ published by Alibaba at the beginning of the year, 63pc of the sellers are in the apparel category while a total of 3.2 million listings have been made from the country so far. But how much does that translate into dollar terms? “Unfortunately even we don’t know the gross merchandise value of goods sold from the country on our platform,” Mr Song Song says. 
That’s strange, isn’t it? Maybe at first. As a B2B e-commerce platform facilitating cross-border trade across hundreds of geographies, Alibaba.com is used by many buyers and sellers for discovery and information before actually negotiating the deal between themselves. “Outside China, the US and Malaysia, the transactions still take place offline so it becomes difficult for us to estimate the worth of goods sold,” the executive explains. 
The reason behind that is, of course, the complicated nature of B2B payments which is made even more complex due to the cross-border nature of transactions. “It’s not like B2C where the average order value would be a few dollars. You are talking hundreds of thousands or even a million dollars per order which the current infrastructure doesn’t allow for in Pakistan. And payments are just one component of it; there’s also fulfilment, integration with customs authorities etc. That entire ecosystem needs to be built,” Mr Song Song says.  
In that case, who else to build the ecosystem other than Alibaba.com — the most successful B2B e-commerce platform? “It requires huge amounts of investments as well as time. In China, it took us around five years to develop it,” he says. Before the company embarks on such an ambitious plan, it first wants to create a local presence and create more awareness among the sellers. 
“We are going to set up a local entity for Alibaba.com, the first such for any of the companies of the Alibaba Group [excluding Daraz and Easypaisa as they were acquisitions], and build an on-ground team in Pakistan for functions like customer service, outreach and marketing by the end of the calendar year,” Mr SongSong shares. This is along with growing their channel partners — currently numbering 10 — who currently act as the e-commerce platform’s representatives in the country and help onboard new users and provide support to the existing ones.

2,Economic cost of political instability,Fundamental economic challenges are back to square one despite a lot of pain absorbed by citizens over the last few years.,"The prevailing political uncertainty arising out of a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan is leading to serious and lingering economic uncertainty. The global geo-political situation following the Russian invasion of Ukraine is having a multiplying effect.
The combination of the two is like a culling machine. Foreign exchange reserves are falling as import bills on the back of oil prices grow, bond yields are increasing, and remittances are straightening out while financing needs increase amid rupee depreciation, double-digit inflation and stock exchange on a downhill path.
This all is a source of perpetual pain for millions of citizens. But the biggest challenge for any government after the political turmoil settles down would be how to absorb the costs of policy distortions that have crept into the system over the past few weeks.
It would cost a lot of political capital to reverse discounts on electricity and oil prices with a four-month freeze to pre-relief level once prudent economic sense prevails. The resultant increase in the circular debt and fiscal deficit otherwise will have their own lagged impact in the shape of inflation and higher debt. These cannot be wished away with delays and indecision.

The fundamental economic challenges are back to square one despite a lot of pain absorbed by the citizens over the last couple of years

As if that is not enough, there is no clarity at all at this moment on how the domestic political and external factors behave in the near future. The possibilities in terms of survival of the current government, an interim government and the term of its tenure or the general elections and the future government have varying degrees of economic costs. The Ukraine crisis is already turning global economies upside down soon after the Covid-induced recession.
The preoccupation with political crises is already having an impact on decision making and governance. The prime minister has not been able to hold a meeting of the federal cabinet for almost a month against the normal weekly schedule. Among the lost list of items on the agenda of the scheduled but cancelled cabinet meeting on March 1 included a mid-year review of the federal budget 2021-22 and key economic indicators. The normal workings at the federal secretariat have also been affected as bureaucrats adopt a ‘wait & see approach’ on day to day running of the government.
That is also where the talks between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and Pakistan authorities remain inconclusive. While the initial objections revolved around populist moves, particularly the relief package, announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan last month, reversing a major impact of the mini-budget under IMF prior actions, the concerns have now shifted to the future of the ongoing IMF programme. Reneged IMF targets would come back to haunt future Pakistan governments and people in the shape of even more stringent prior actions.
With the no-confidence move by the joint opposition, the scope of these concerns has rather expanded, adding fuel to the uncertainties. The more relevant anxieties now pertain to questions if an interim set-up could carry forward the remaining part of the Fund programme and whether or not it could return to the mini-budget announced in January and what if a future majority in parliament shuns ownership of the State Bank law.
In such circumstances, the IMF staff may hesitate to bring up Pakistan’s case before its executive board for the remaining tranches at least before the upcoming spring meetings in the third week of April. Perhaps because of such an eventuality, the government had taken a wish list of about $21 billion financial support from China during Prime Minister Khan’s visit. This included about $4.3bn debt rollover maturing within the current month.
Pakistan expected an arrangement with China with the consent of the IMF to have access to a part of the $40bn increased quota the Fund had allowed to China as part of its Covid-19 quota expansion to member countries. On return from Beijing, Prime Minister’s Special Assistant on CPEC Affairs Khalid Mansoor had told a news conference that Chinese leadership took note of these requests and promised to consider and then communicate their decision accordingly in response to questions about Pakistan’s request for the $4bn debt rollover, extension in currency swap from the existing $4.5bn to $10bn and $5.5bn in additional financial support.
While authorities anxiously await a formal response, the political uncertainty may have some ramifications here too as Chinese leadership may like to steer clear of the situation. The current account deficit, in the meanwhile, has reached almost $12bn in the first seven months with full-year projections at around $18-19bn — a level the PTI had inherited in 2018.
Even though the PTI government did not inherit an ideal situation, its indecision or delayed decision to go back to the IMF cost the country dearly. Amid tough stabilisation policy, the worst ever health pandemic rather came as a saving grace as international lenders, particularly the IMF, opted for an accommodative policy and provided additional financial assistance with almost no strings attached.
But the authorities failed to push through long-standing structural reforms and instead came up with three money-whitening schemes. Also, it diverted more funds out of external support to big businesses rather than making them efficient and competitive. The belated increases in electricity rates aimed at containing circular debt have been brought back to a level initiated two years ago.
The fundamental economic challenges are back to square one despite a lot of pain absorbed by the citizens over the last couple of years. Pakistan again stands at the crossroads it comes across every election cycle. The difference this time is that challenges are greater than before and remedies may also be even tougher as uncertainties prolong.

3,Hasty growth in housing finance,The euphoric demand for housing finance and a liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks.,"Agriculture and housing loans — along with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) finance — are vital for boosting economic activity. And, if banks start lending more to all the three sectors at the same time, that almost guarantees accelerated GDP growth in the short-to-medium term. 
Currently, though, banks are not wholesomely engaged in such an exercise. But the government and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) are trying to promote just that. Policies introduced for accelerating housing loans offer an added advantage to the government — they make room for politically-motivated tax amnesty in the name of the documentation of the economy. The ongoing Naya Pakistan Housing Programme (NPHP) is no exception.
Regardless of the fact that this is opening yet another avenue under this programme for the whitening of tax-evaded money, housing loans being offered under NPHP are quite promising. Already, they have reactivated the real estate and building construction sector and continue to enliven demand for outputs of dozens of allied industries and services sub-sectors. Their impact on the overall economy (rebased to 2015-16) is already being felt and is sure to become more and more pronounced with the passage of time. That is if future governments let the programme continue in its current form and spirit.

The euphoric demand for housing finance and liberal supply of loans remains subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme 

Within seven months of this fiscal year (ie between July 2021 and Jan 2022), banks disbursed fresh consumers loans of Rs47.6 billion for the construction of buildings. In addition to this, they also disbursed Rs11.8bn loans to their employees for the same purpose.
Thus, overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn, the latest SBP stats reveal. During the same period of the last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was too small — Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn! 
The demand for housing finance remained strong right from the beginning of this fiscal year partly because builders were using tax-evaded money for launching new housing projects following extension in the tax amnesty scheme. Partly, higher economic growth in 2021-21 compared to that of 2019-20 also motivated people to take advantage of the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme made easier this year — and apply for housing loans. 
So, the volumes of housing finance offered so far could have been larger had banks been able to process loans applications a bit more speedily. The PTI government, challenged on all fronts and struggling for its survival, is pushing banks to their limits through the central bank to accelerate the disbursement of housing loans. So, one can hope that the volumes of fresh housing loans would grow even faster in near future, more so because the “no-question asked” status of the investment coming into this sector has been extended — once again — to the end of FY22 in June.

The overall lending for construction of buildings in the first seven months of this fiscal year totalled Rs59.4bn while during the same period last fiscal year, total lending for housing buildings was Rs7.9bn for general consumers and Rs22bn for bank employees or a total of Rs29.9bn

Growth in housing finance and underlying expansion in construction activities continue to fuel growth in allied sectors as well. During July-Dec 2021, manufacturing of iron and steel grew by 18.4 per cent, whereas in the same period of 2020 this sub-sector of large-scale manufacturing had contracted by 12.1pc, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics. 
Monthly cement production which was below 3.7 million tonnes in July 2021 gradually picked up and peaked at 4.48m tonnes in October before coming down to 4.3m tonnes and 4m tonnes in November and December respectively, due to a dramatic rise in the cost of production of coal-fired cement plants after skyrocketing of coal prices in international markets — and not due to slackness in demand. 
To meet the increasing demand for housing finance, and particularly to meet the demand for low-cost housing, the SBP has now eased prudential regulations of microfinance banks. “The changes made in the prudential regulations include additional guidance on property assessment, mortgage creation and risk management,” the central bank announced on March 16. By end of 2021, total lending already made in the housing sector stood at Rs20bn — the number of beneficiaries was 75,000, an SBP press release said.
Moving forward, accelerated disbursement of housing finance through microfinance banks can be expected to boost volumes of financing and enhance the number of loan takers. But whether microfinance loans for housing can actually lead to the construction of new low-cost housing units is doubtful. These loans are likely to end up for purchasing already constructed flats and one-unit residential units or for the renovation of existing houses and apartments. 
The current euphoric demand for housing finance from commercial banks and an equally liberal supply of housing loans remain subject to ground reality checks after the expiry of the tax amnesty scheme in June. If tax amnesty for investment in the housing sector is allowed to expire on time — and not extended any further — construction of new houses and apartments may come to a halt. But that perhaps doesn’t bother the government. 
Another worrisome aspect of the housing finance euphoria is that banks are offering housing loans to their employees, particularly senior executives, a bit too liberally. The central bank needs to watch mortgage finance to bank employees closely to ward off any possible development of banks-builders nexus. Powerful builders particularly those with strong links with politicians and the establishment have successfully circumvented banking and environmental laws in the past for the construction of prized projects both in Karachi and Islamabad. Some of them still continue to do this. 
While making more housing loans, banks must also focus on ensuring their sustainability in terms of market risks and the risk of defaults.

4,The challenges of the electronic warehouse receipt system,"If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately ...","The resource-constraint smallholder farmers are unattractive candidates for credit from formal financial institutions, which tend to ignore them because of their often unpredictable, fragmented and unstructured agricultural activities.
The State Bank of Pakistan, like the central banks of many other developing countries, is introducing schemes to increase access of small farmers to the formal credit channels, saving them from exploitation by informal money lenders.
The SBP, in this respect, has recently launched the electronic warehouse receipt (EWR) system for maize crop in Kasur district, almost a year after the scheme was introduced for paddy crop in Hafizabad, another central Punjab district. The EWR enables the depositor, whether a producer or dealer, of an agriculture commodity to use it as collateral for obtaining bank loans or trade in commodity markets, if and when the system is linked with the commodities exchange as well.
If run professionally and efficiently, it may also reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low. Thus, it may ensure a better return to farmers for their financial and physical investment and also help stabilise market prices. The system may also reduce post-harvest losses as care of the stored commodity is handed over to certified warehouses equipped with the required facilities and expertise.

If run professionally and efficiently, it may reduce pressure on farmers to sell their produce in panic immediately after harvests when prices are normally low while allowing agriculture commodities to be used as collateral for bank loans

However, the insufficient number of certified warehouses complying with preservation norms, lack of awareness among farmers and their limited business skills, and no incentives for buyers to purchase commodities from the warehouses are identified as the stumbling blocks in the expansion of the system.
Afaq Tiwana, a progressive farmer, says the EWR may be beneficial for the community only if the SBP scheme includes a blueprint for bridging the infrastructure (warehouses and logistics) gap. “There is an acute shortage of certified warehouses and reliable logistic facilities that are required to run the system satisfactorily.” He advocates for incentivising the infrastructure building by assuring business for the owners of the storage units the whole year so that they are attracted to invest more and more in the sector.
For this purpose, he argues, the government needs to get out of the business of wheat, the biggest crop of the country. The government is the major player in the wheat market but does not utilise private warehouses depriving them of around six-month business, he says. A mix of wheat, rice and maize crops, etc will ensure the warehouses do business throughout the year because of their different seasons. Mr Tiwana says for food security the government may buy grain from the warehouses if and when required through bidding.
Ibad Khan, president of Guava Growers Association, endorses the views saying by opting for the private warehousing system the government may save non-development expenditures worth billions of rupees consumed by thousands of Food Department employees in the name of salaries and perks, operating costs of their vehicles and buildings, etc “without doing any good”.
“The (provincial) government may buy four million tonnes of wheat from the certified warehouses through the Pakistan Commodities Exchange and lift the grain when needed from there. It will equal a surplus of thousands of food department employees and thus save huge funds required for the functioning of the department, as well as the hassle of checking theft of the crop from its storages by unscrupulous staff.”
Mr Khan thinks the farm produce warehousing concept may gain currency provided the farming community is given proper awareness and the purpose is well served easily by engaging the Agriculture Department’s field staff. “If a farmer learns that by spending Rs50, for instance, as storage rent, his produce will earn Rs100 then he will automatically turn towards the EWR scheme. The extension wing of the Agriculture Department is in close proximity to the rural population and may help mobilise them for it.”
An attractive package to build high-quality warehouses can find 15 to 20 investors in each village ready to build the storage if provided information/guidance about the business scope and initial technical assistance in running the facilities until these become self-sufficient, he asserts.
While the functioning of the facility will benefit the farming community in many ways, Mr Tiwana says the prevailing farm produce trade system is built to make the rich richer. “At present 70 to 80 per cent of commodities are sold at harvesting time in the country. And thus, these fetch lower rates for the farmers. Large processors and the influential (textile, feed, flour millers, etc) have huge amounts of cash at hand and make these purchases knowing that the prices will shoot up within months. Besides value-addition through their mills, they also earn a big profit through commodities trade, robbing millions of farmers of the money that actually belongs to them.”
The EWR facility will save the poor farmers from panic selling as well as stabilise prices in the open market at harvesting time because an adequate quantity of the produce would have been deposited with the warehouses, freeing the market from surplus crops. This would ensure a better return even for those farmers who will be opting to sell their produce in the spot market, he adds.
Mr Khan stresses that the warehousing concept must be linked to the Commodities Exchange for the sake of the sustainability of the system and that the Exchange should be relocated to Punjab, the largest producer of agricultural products so that those involved in active farming have easy access to it. He laments that no farmer association was engaged by the SBP or any other government entity to seek their input for the scheme.
For Amer Hayat Bhandara, a progressive grower from Pakpattan, the EWR facility seems to be working only for those farmers and final buyers who are qualified customers of commercial banks. He points out that one of the most common problems of the farmer is informal debt: farmers take loans from people in the market with personal guarantees and with a condition that the crop will be sold through them.
Will the middlemen allow the farmer to go for the EWR, he questions? Suppose if farmers want to do so, then the debt of the middleman will be repaid through EWR, but how will the inputs like seeds, fertilisers, fuel and pesticides for the next crop be acquired?

5,Business leaders and sleepless nights,It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.,"


 
THE critical domains of the economy and foreign affairs have taken a back seat as the political leadership has been left to scramble for continuing in power. This seems to be rather dicey in a world that is trying to deal with fragile energy markets and food security in its Covid-battered existence, and global peace in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
In addition to tales of human sufferings, the war has disturbed global commodity markets, disrupted supply chains, hiked freight charges and posed challenges to the global financial system after the West slapped harsh sanctions on Russia and excluded it from the SWIFT system of money transfers. Experts and economists have predicted slower growth and an increase in inflation worldwide.   
Instead of strategising to deal with the evolving global challenges, Islamabad appears to be too busy to care. Global experts have included Pakistan amongst the more vulnerable nations where the impact of the fallout of war is expected to be severe owing to the resource-deficient country’s dependence on oil, gas and edible imports.

It’s time to lie low as there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over

Just as the masses are doing, businesses are also watching closely the events unfolding at a bewildering pace under the full glare of the media spotlight. With the final outcome not quite certain, the whole saga is keeping business houses unnerved.
The common man is desperately waiting for the debilitating economic stress to ease off to the extent that it possibly can, while the business class is dreading a hostile reaction of the West to the hard stance of the government towards the US and Europe. The handshake images of Prime Minister Imran Khan and President Putin in Moscow on the day Russia launched its attack on Ukraine has already placed the country in an awkward position. 
Some like to project the current situation in Pakistan as the expected manifestation of civil unrest over inflation and job losses, while others link it to be the outcome of deeper structural imbalance. And then there are those who see the struggle rooted in efforts to uphold the supremacy of civilian leadership. 
Argumentative Pakistanis can debate the politics, but they all agree that the economy and its challenges have taken a back seat for now and things will be difficult irrespective of the final outcome of the no-confidence motion in parliament.
The leading lights of business class, when approached for a comment, were evasive. Afraid to land on the wrong side of the current or the future set of rulers, they shared their disappointment with the political class privately, saying it was frustrating to watch the politicians “stoop too low whenever tested”. 
A senior business leader commented” “Prime Minister Imran Khan and his confidants are inciting violence much like Trump did in the US. How can they not understand the consequences? If politicians fail to resist the temptation to take their conflict out of parliament it can make the country drift towards anarchy. Yes, we are worried for our businesses, but we are more concerned about the safety and security of our family and the future of this country.” 
Musadaq Zulqarnain, of Interloop fame, believed that “irrespective of the outcome of the vote in parliament or the movement on the streets, the economy is not in a good shape. It will get worse because of political turbulence which will be followed by popular measures to please the masses without fundamental corrections. 
“Pakistan needs a sustained growth of 7-8 per cent for several years, powered by an increase in exports if it wants to come out of its economic troubles. The only solution is a consensus document — the Charter of Economy — which must be vigorously followed irrespective of the party in power,” he said.
Nasser Hayat Magoon, former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the troubles had aggravated in the last couple of years. The budget, he thought, has failed to spark much interest among the legislators. In his opinion, it is influenced by “a select group of businessmen that encircles the leadership”. 
Sources in the Ministry of Finance told Dawn that the budget exercise initiated in January has been in progress at the routine pace. 
Pulling out his wish-list, Mr Magnoon said: “The FPCCI suggested simplification of taxation, which was promised but was resisted by the tax bureaucracy. We do not expect a business-friendly budget. The timing of the budget will be contingent on how the present chaotic political situation settles.” 
He said the private sector needs to communicate with political parties and sensitise them to the variety of problems that are being faced by businesses. He warned that street agitation in the current charged environment may have serious consequences. 
Mian Anjum Nisar, another business leader, lamented the lack of clarity in politics, while Majyd Aziz was critical of mismatched priorities of successive governments. 
Regardless of the concerns voiced by the business community, everybody realises that at least in the short term, there is no chance of any clarity till the no-confidence move is over.

6,Auto parts — setting a new record for imports,New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere 5pc locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce foreign exchange burden.,"Pakistan’s import bill for completely and semi-knocked down (CKD/SKD) kits for cars imported by local assemblers has crossed one billion dollars in just eight months of 2021-22 which is significantly higher than the record high bill of $1.12 billion for the entire of FY21.
The 8MFY22 ended with $1.102bn as compared to $557 million in the same period last fiscal. 
The low levels of localisation by Chinese and Korean investors under Auto Policy 2016-2021 for five years as well as in the new models by existing assemblers have played a key role in boosting the import bill.
As per data of the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the new and old entrants brought CKD/SKD kits worth $4.987bn from 2016-2017 to July-February 2021-2022, thus nullifying claims of achieving higher localisation.
Sources said that the new entrants have started rolling out vehicles from their assembly lines with a mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange. 

New entrants are rolling out vehicles with mere five per cent locally made parts which is insufficient to reduce the burden on the foreign exchange rate

Assemblers are now in top gear as the eight months of FY22 ended with a whooping sales jump of 57.5pc in cars to 149,813 units. They are also excited over huge bookings in hands whose delivery time ranges between three months to 11 months. Jeeps and pickups sales have also surged by 51.5pc in 8MFY22 to 28,437 units.
Huge demand for cars has led to a massive jump in CKD/SKD imports to $1.120bn in FY21 from $478mn in FY20, up by 134pc thanks to low-interest rates and attractive auto financing by the banks till the third quarter of 2021
However, curbs on auto financing from the last quarter of 2021, persistent increase in car prices and long delays in delivery appear to have not hurt the buyers’ sentiments in the last eight months, while buyers are also satisfied over the rising resale value of the vehicles owing to months’ long delivery timings, soaring prices and on-money for vehicles for immediate delivery. 
The import bill of CKD/SKD was $660m in FY17 which later swelled to $809m in FY18 and then remained at $818mn in FY19. The fiscal year 2019-2020 was a bad year for the entire country due to the flare-up in Covid-19 from March to June followed by the government’s decision to close down the industrial units in April 2020. As a result, the FY20 import bill of CKD/SKD was just $478m.
Stakeholders had been trumpeting 70pc localisation in Suzuki Mehran which ruled the roads for over 30 years without significant model change. After the end of the iconic Mehran journey in 2018, the claim of achieving higher localisation by stakeholders has now been confined to 55-60pc in various existing Japanese models and 35-45pc in new models. 
It seems that no serious efforts have been made by the existing Japanese assemblers in the old and new models to improve the utilisation levels  of locally made parts in vehicles.
A vendor, who asked not to be named, said the import bill of CKD/SKD would remain under pressure as the new entrants, who had approved their projects under the Auto Policy 2016-2021, would enjoy a honeymoon period for the next four to five years to keep rolling out vehicles with negligible local content. Besides, new models by the existing Japanese assemblers will also take time in improving local content in the vehicles.
He said vendors had asked the government not to allow vehicles’ assembly of higher engine power under tAuto Policy 2016-2021. The new entrants, instead of introducing small cars below 800cc, shifted their focus towards the assembly of high engine power sports utility vehicles (SUV) whose numbers are growing every day.
Chief Operating Officer, Balochistan Wheel Limited (BWL), Muhammad Irfan Ghani in a letter to the CEO Engineering Development Board (EDB) said the EDB is the custodian of the auto vending industry which encourages the localisation of auto parts.
The auto sector in Pakistan is now more than 50 years old but the assemblers have not done localisation seriously, he complained.
He said the pace of localisation of auto parts is too slow due to the discouraging attitudes and lengthy procedures adopted by the assemblers which form a monopoly for their foreign principals. They protect their own interests to use their CKD parts and have made localisation very  difficult. 
Mr Ghani said the country’s precious foreign exchange is being wasted due to non-localisation while many assemblers are not taking parts from the local vendors in some of their newly launched models.
The matter came up for discussion during the first meeting of the Auto Industry Development and Export Committee (AIDEC) held on March 8, 2022, which was attended by the auto stakeholders and officials of the relevant ministries. The AIDEC meeting had decided that the EDB would schedule a joint meeting between Baluchistan Wheels and Pak Suzuki to resolve the matter.
However, AIDEC committee members reiterated that the localisation of parts and components must be pursued in letter and spirit. 
Former Chairman Pakistan Association of Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), Abdul Rahman Aizaz attributed the rising import bill of CKD to the massive revival in sales of cars and SUVs from the depressed sales scenario of 2019-2020.
Under Auto Policy 2016-2021, most of the new entrants have focused on manufacturing SUVs, which too has resulted in the higher value of CKD imports. He said that sales volumes of new entrants and old players have shown phenomenal growth due to improving economic indicators.
Since the new entrants under Auto Policy 2016-21 can avail the concession on import of CKD for five years, localisation of parts in such vehicles, especially of SUVs, is in the catching-up phase, he added.
Mr Aizaz said that the unprecedented surge in international prices of various resins and metals, rupee devaluation against the dollar and multiple times higher freight charges have further enhanced the landed cost of almost all raw materials.

7,Surviving tough times,"Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy.","The rupee hit its lowest ever of over 180 to a dollar in the interbank market on the weekend as the shares market continues to decline. 
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) appears largely satisfied with the PTI government’s explanation of the Rs346 billion relief package announced late last month in an apparent attempt to appease the inflation-stricken households. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 9.75 per cent but its warning that it could advance the next Monetary Policy Committee meeting to raise the interest rates if need be has pushed cut-off yields in the last public sector debt auction.
The political instability in the wake of a no-confidence motion submitted by the opposition to oust the prime minister is forcing the government to take populist measures that it might not have if it weren’t facing the existential threat from the opposition political parties that have come together to push Imran Khan out of power in spite of their deep divisions. 

Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy — many hard decisions will have to be made

No one expected the Kaptaan to go away without fighting till the last ball, but the last week’s events in Islamabad have spawned fears of violence. The storming of the Parliament Lodges, where the opposition lawmakers were housed by police commandos and counter-terrorism force was followed by the attack of the PTI workers on Sindh House in Islamabad. It happened after the opposition gave media access to the place to interview dissident parliamentarians of the ruling party. 
The ruling party’s insistence to gather a million people outside the parliament in the event of the vote on the no-confidence resolution and the threats being tossed around by the ministers has forced the opposition political parties to make their own plans to counter the move. Indeed, everyone expected the prime minister to fight back — but not in this way. 
The situation is fluid and may likely continue for several weeks to come, with its impact expected to reverberate for many months. Regardless of who wins and who loses the no-trust motion, the government will not find it easy to handle the economy. Many tough decisions will have to be made. If the opposition succeeds in de-seating the prime minister, it will have its work cut out for them. 
The first job would be to approach the IMF to release the next tranche to shore up foreign exchange reserves and take the pressure off the home currency. PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has already hinted at renegotiating the deal with the multilateral lender. It is not clear if the Washington-based fund would be more kind to the new government than the Imran Khan administration. 
The second job, the businessmen interviewed by telephone over the weekend say, for whoever — the PTI or the opposition parties — is in power after the vote on the motion would be to mend Pakistan’s relationship with the West, especially the United States. “That does not necessarily mean that we have to dial down our ties with China. Going to Russia when the Kremlin had planned to attack Ukraine was a big foreign policy mistake Imran Khan made. He could have called off the tour and stayed neutral. That would not have brought upon us such pressure from the European Union and the US, with which our relations are already facing problems due to the Taleban takeover of Kabul last summer,” a textile exporter argued. 
“Improvement in our ties with Washington and European capitals is crucial not only for securing some concessions from the IMF but also to get out of the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).”
A senior executive of a chemical company was of the view that once politics cool down Islamabad will have to reconsider its policy towards India. “If you think you can improve your relationship with the West and get off the FATF’s enhanced monitoring regime without making some kind of headway with New Delhi, you are totally mistaken. I have information that our present military leadership too is in favour of resuming ties with India,” he claimed.
However, there are others who feel that the top priority has to be given to the resolution of domestic political problems. “The settlement of the outstanding issues with the IMF and the western powers is important. But more important is to tackle our domestic problems first. I cannot say if the present government will be in power after a few days or not. But in my opinion, once this crisis is over, all the parties must sit together and develop a consensus on electoral reforms so that we can have political stability. I think that the government term of five years should be curtailed to four years. We are very impatient people and a kind of fatigue starts to take over us every three to four years. If we manage to clean up our political mess, we will be able to put back the economy on the rails and end our international isolation.”

8,Chickens have come  home to roost,"Policymakers are constantly trailing behind the march of events, lacking a grip over the evolving situation.","In the current phase of recurring political and economic crises, a sort of buffer zone has been carved out that enables most businesses to prosper even when a country’s economy is in deep distress.
Big businesses also increase their reliance on the informal sector to reduce their cost of doing business. Some segments of the informal small businesses also expand. Similarly, the market economy has also developed its own resilience to face uncertainties in not so visible ways.
The rebasing of Pakistan’s economy shows that economic growth has been faster than officially estimated. Notwithstanding these positive trends, the political economy is being undermined by rapid erosion of social and political cohesion particularly over the past three and a half years. 
Normally, a ruling party is expected to keep political temperatures down to remain focused on resolving the country’s socio-economic problems, and more so, in turbulent times as now, prompting the need for political and economic transformation.
But PTI leadership has a fatal attraction for political confrontation. To quote PML-Q leader Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, the PTI government never learnt how to build relationships and instead ‘ruined things with everyone including its own people.’ And most PTI political allies, Mr Elahi adds, are inclined towards the opposition.
PTI’s aggressive posture has forced major opposition parties to unite on a one-point agenda: the removal of the prime minister through a vote of no-confidence. If the opposition succeeds, it would be the first time that a prime minister would be removed not by martial law or establishment but by a democratic parliamentary process.
Implicit in a recent statement of information minister Fawad Chaudhry is the admission of the failure of the ruling party’s highly adversarial instance against the opposition. He said “democracy was not a system of extreme divisions, it was based on a consensus on certain things. It is not difficult to fight but reconciliation is difficult later. I don’t think (politics) should be so divisive that it should become difficult to talk (to each other).”
Facing a challenging political situation, Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked his close aides to refrain from making remarks against the allied parties in the coalition government. 
Many of the ‘electable(s)’ and PTI allies who helped Prime Minister Imran Khan come to power are now hobnobbing with PTI’s arch-rivals. PTI has lost the opportunity to cement its ties with its allies to make participatory democracy at the federal level a success.
Mr Khan was totally unprepared to face the real economic challenges as evident from his frequent policy U-turns. That has not stopped. And no less important, he is falling back on traditional policies such as amnesty schemes pursued by his predecessors to resolve problems. 
After being in power for three and a half years, the incumbent government is unable even to stick to agreements reached with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as indicated by the latest four-month relief package.
Policymakers are constantly trailing behind the march of events, lacking a grip over the evolving situation.
Under rising domestic political pressure the relief package was announced soon after the mini-budget and immediately after and the $1 billion tranche was received by Pakistan. The finance ministry did not get IMF’s approval in prior consultations with the Fund. Now there is no cut-off date for IMF discussions
Social cohesion is also being eroded by prolonged high inflation which economists consider an important indicator that there is something seriously wrong with the economy.
Neither did PTI make any effort to evolve a charter of economy, widely seen as the need of the times because of its strong passion for solo flight.
PML-Q President Chaudhry Shujaat has urged both the PTI and the opposition to call off the power shows at D-Chowk because, given the current situation, Pakistan can’t afford this dangerous confrontation.
The threat of global stagflation, triggered by the war in Ukraine and its related sanctions, has coincided with political tensions and instability hitting a new high in Pakistan.   
International experts have already warned that emerging economies will be more fragile and vulnerable to inflation and even to political instability as a result of the fallout of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Pakistan’s vulnerability to external shocks is enhanced because of the low level of regional economic and trade cooperation. East Asian economies have weathered regional and global shocks because regional trade integration has insulated or diluted these external shocks to a very large extent, says a former State Bank governor.
Pakistan has not been able to subdue insurgency, militancy and extremism for decades which is on the upswing. We are paying the price for keeping the tribal areas politically, economically and socially backward. 
It is on the votes of the National Assembly members that Mr Khan was elected as the prime minister of Pakistan. But his principal mode of governance has been to rule the country through ordinances.
The National Assembly website shows that seven ordinances were promulgated in the government’s first parliamentary year, 30 in the second, and more than 16 ordinances have already been issued in the ongoing year. The Supreme Court has ruled against excessive use of ordinances to run the government, observing that an ordinance could only be used in ‘emergent matters.’
And the prime minister is now facing the backlash of self-assertion by a segment of the ruling party as well as political allies. Confrontation is proving counterproductive both on the national and international levels.
In just after two weeks of the Ukraine war, an eminent US economist says Western sanctions are proving to be a double-edged weapon. The fallout of global inflation on the US economy, he adds, may force the US to withdraw the sanctions to avoid their impact on the US states elections due in November.
The international oil prices have dropped on the initial hope that Ukraine and Russia talks are taking a positive turn and speculated lower Chinese demand due to pandemic-related travel ban. However, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Pesko says it is too early to predict the progress in peace talks. In Pakistan, the rupee continues to slide against the dollar.
The big question in Pakistan now is: does the opposition have any workable strategy to shore up the economy for the benefit of the suffering common citizens, if they succeed in toppling Imran Khan’s government? How will political fragmentation be overcome and national unity forged?

9,Data points,Forgoing the resume for jobs,"Forgoing the resume for jobs
When Health Data Research UK, a public-health research nonprofit, sought to improve the industry’s track record of recruiting Black women by starting a new internship program, it removed a key aspect of the screening process: the résumé. Instead of looking at the educational or professional experience to choose finalists from the 159 applicants for its program for Black people in health data science positions, the group created a short questionnaire that asked candidates to explain what artificial intelligence was or to talk about a recent piece of technology they were studying. The result was that more female candidates applied than men. In the end, 30 of the 48 interns that Health Data Research hired were women. The organisation is now using the same skills-based recruiting to make full-time hires. The effort was part of a movement of organisations setting up hiring processes that downplay the importance of academic and professional pedigrees.

Lockdown impact on energy
The first critical impact of the pandemic on the energy sector was the reduction in the annual energy demand in Pakistan. According to the Ministry of Energy, the electricity consumption was reduced by around 30-40pc in March 2020. The commercial sector experienced the largest demand drop of around 75pc, followed by the industrial sector that stood at 65pc. Although residential demand for energy increased, this had a significant economic impact as around 70pc of the power consumed by the residential sector is subsidised. The power distribution companies were also substantively impacted as the recoveries fell to 88.77pc from 90.25pc in 2018-19, mainly due to the practice of manual billing which was restricted due to travelling constraints and mobility limitations. Against 7.6pc required an annual decrease of emissions under the Paris Agreement the total emissions in 2020 fall by around 8pc in Pakistan.

My cartoon ape got stolen
If someone takes your apes on the blockchain, you can try to get them back in federal court. There’s now a lawsuit in which a guy named Timothy McKimmy is suing non-fungible token (NFT) exchange OpenSea for allegedly negligently causing him to lose his NFT in the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection. He would like his ape back. Imagine telling a federal judge “see, my cartoon ape is vastly more valuable than Justin Bieber’s because it is in the top 14pc rarity, so please award me millions of dollars of damages against the exchange that negligently allowed someone to buy my ape for 0.01 ETH.” “What is an ETH,” the judge might reasonably ask. “The ape is a computer image, what does it mean that someone else possesses it, or that it is rare,” the judge might reasonably ask. “Why can’t you just right-click and save it, then you’d have your ape back,” the judge might reasonably ask.

Musk’s space race
Rivals of Elon Musk’s Starlink might be dismissed as jealous or downright anti-competitive when they object to SpaceX’s plan to launch 30,000 more satellites into orbit for its space-based broadband service. It is not so easy to dismiss warnings from Nasa, one of SpaceX’s most loyal customers. Last month the US space agency wrote to the Federal Communications Commission outlining concerns about SpaceX’s plans for a second generation of satellites to add to the 12,000 already licensed. These range from the substantially heightened risk of collisions, adding to an already growing cloud of space debris, to the fact that so many Starlink satellites would make it harder to detect a “potentially catastrophic” asteroid strike on earth. According to Nasa, SpaceX’s proposals would leave a satellite streak in every asteroid survey image ‘rendering portions of images unusable’.

15,The rush for digital banking licenses,Market information indicates that there are more than 40 local and international applicants vying for the five licenses.,"In January 2022, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced that in line with its objective of financial inclusion and digitising financial transactions it would, in the first cohort, approve five digital banking licenses. Regulatory frameworks for digital banks, also known as neo banks or challenger banks, have been propagated in a handful of countries globally; hence, once again the Pakistani regulator is leading from the front. 
The SBP has a history of framing highly successful regulations. In 2001, it created a special license category for microfinance banks — this resulted in 4.65 million active microfinance loan customers and 75.5m saving customers, while our highly profitable commercial industry has only managed 1.5m active loan customers. 
The SBP followed this with the Branchless Banking (BB) regulations. This allowed BB operators to convert kiryana (mom and pop) stores to become banking service touchpoints and was indeed revolutionary in bringing financial services to the common man. 
The last license introduced was the Electronic Money Institution (EMI). The EMI license allowed non-financial institutions with a material customer base to enter the payments business. Using the customer lens, these EMI, when they are launched commercially, are expected to also digitise cash transactions.

Market information indicates that there are more than 40 local and international applicants vying for the five licenses

The digital banking license announcement by the SBP has created more excitement locally and internationally than all the previous licenses combined. After all, Pakistan is a country ripe for financial inclusion. Currently, it has only 10m active loan customers. While digital payments are growing exponentially, they remain a fraction of cash transactions. 
Similarly, while in the recent past, digital wallets have experienced phenomenal growth, active wallets are still under 10m. We have the ability to verify a customer’s identity using real-time biometrics and are moving towards facial and voice recognition. Hence, both the railroad and the addressable market exists for building a game-changing institution.
The SBP has been a visionary in creating the enabling environment for a successful digital bank. It must demonstrate even more sagacity in awarding the digital license. The market information is that there are more than 40 local and international applicants vying for the five licenses. The SBP’s utmost priority should be to increase the number of active loan customers. Its ambition should be 100m loan-active individual and small and medium enterprise (SME) customers over the next five years. 
The driver has to be lending, not payments or savings. The reason is that the payments’ objective of the SBP can be achieved through the existing EMI license and does not require a digital banking license. The 100m active loan customers must firstly come from individuals, with additional weightage for rural, female and youth. 
This is possible through data-based lending. Artificial intelligence, using data points from smartphones, GSM data, e-commerce purchases, and food deliveries, provides adequate data points to enable small ticket instant loans to this segment. This will entail high loss rates at inception, till the algorithm learns to discern between a good and bad customer. Without this risk-taking, we will remain a low lending penetration country.
Similarly, additional weightage needs to be provided for lending to the ‘s’ of the SMEs and small farmers. The SMEs, especially the small enterprises, have been seriously neglected by the banking section. Like the individual segment, lending must be based on analytics based on data points and not the traditional collateral method. 
Data, which has always existed has now been digitised and made readily available. Using data points like purchases from fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), air time from telcos, receivables and payables from start-ups, and digitised khatas (physical ledgers), a digital bank must make material inroads in this neglected space. 
Similarly, digital banks if they truly want to address the needs of the masses must develop innovative savings products. They need to understand how Pakistanis save, and currently putting money in a bank account is not the most popular mode of savings.
A digital bank must have the customer lens as its principal lens. How easy is the customer journey? How friendly is the customer app? How much memory of the phone does it consume? The customer journey cannot be limited to the front end. How long does it take for the digital bank to make a credit decision? This must be in seconds… not days. How quickly are approved funds made available? Again, in minutes… not days. All required documents must be digital and embedded in the app and digital signatures are a must. The customer journey must be frictionless.
The SBP has created a positive enabling environment through digital banking regulations. To meet its principal objective of financial inclusion, it must make the customer journey and digital lending its principal criteria.
