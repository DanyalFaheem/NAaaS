0,Canadian mosque worshippers attacked with bear spray,Police say the congregants received minor injuries as a result of the bear spray.,"MISSISSAUGA (Ontario): Worshippers at dawn prayer in a suburb of Toronto tackled and subdued a 24-year-old man who allegedly entered their mosque and attacked people with bear spray on Saturday, according to local police.
Peel Regional Police said the man walked into the Dar Al-Tawheed Islamic Centre in Mississauga, Ontario, and allegedly “discharged bear spray towards people in the mosque while brandishing a hatchet just before 7am”.
Speaking on behalf of the mosque, Nadia Hasan of the National Council of Canadian Muslims, said a group of about 20 men were praying when the man sprayed them.
Some of the men turned around and they very bravely decided that they were not going to let him attack them, she said. “They tackled him to the ground and apprehended him until the police showed up.”
Mohammad Moiz Omar of Mississauga has been arrested. Police say they’re considering all possible motivations for the incident, and charges are pending.
Police said the congregants received minor injuries as a result of the bear spray.
People are obviously quite shaken up and are recovering, Hasan said. For the most part, folks are still processing whats happened and are trying to kind of see how they can ensure that their communities remain secure.
Canadian Prime Minister Justice Trudeau condemned the attack, calling it  “incredibly disturbing in a tweet. I strongly condemn this violence which has no place in Canada and I’m keeping the community in my thoughts today.
“I also want to applaud the courage of those who were there this morning.
Premier Doug Ford, meanwhile, said,  “There is NO place in our province for such evil and hateful acts. We must ensure those responsible are brought to justice.”

1,North Korea fires multiple rocket launchers,"“Our military is maintaining our defence readiness while closely following related developments,” says senior military official.","SEOUL: North Korea fired multiple rocket launchers on Sunday, Seoul said, the latest in a series of provocations by the nuclear-armed nation to heighten tensions in the region.
Pyongyang launched a string of banned weaponry this year and tested what it claimed were components of a “reconnaissance satellite” — although Seoul and Washington have described them as a new ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) system.
“There were shots suspected to be from North Korea’s multiple rocket launchers this morning,” said the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a text message to reporters.
“Our military is maintaining our defence readiness while closely following related developments,” it added, without further detail.
Four shots were fired into the western waters during a span of an hour from 7:20 am from an unspecified location in South Pyongan province, Yonhap news agency reported citing unnamed officials.
The intention of the firing was being evaluated, the report added.
South Korea’s National Security Council held an emergency meeting and called for a tight readiness posture to “prevent security vacuum during the government transition period”, according to a statement from the presidential Blue House.
President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol will be inaugurated on May 10 after winning the March 9 polls.
Pyongyang has long possessed the ability to devastate Seoul — which is only around 60km from the border — with artillery fire.

2,UK-US dual citizen returns to prison in Iran after furlough,DUBAI: A dual British-US national temporarily released from prison last week as part of a deal between Iran and the...,"DUBAI: A dual British-US national temporarily released from prison last week as part of a deal between Iran and the United Kingdom was taken back into custody just two days later, his lawyer said on Sunday.
Iranian prison officials let the long-held 66-year-old environmentalist, Morad Tahbaz, leave jail on a furlough last Wednesday, the same day as two high-profile British citizens who had been detained in Iran for more than five years were freed and flown home to Britain.
The UK said it secured Tahbaz’s furlough, along with the release and return of charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and retired civil engineer Anoosheh Ashoori, after settling a long-standing debt to Iran that had fueled tensions between the countries for decades.
But barely two days after Tahbaz left jail and headed to his family’s home in Tehran, Iranian security forces forced him to return to Evin Prison, his Tehran-based lawyer said.
Unfortunately, we have no idea if or when he is going to be released, Hojjat Kermani said. He is back in Evin for the time being. Iranian officials and state-run media did not acknowledge his return to prison. Iran’s mission to the United Nations also did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did officials in Iran’s judiciary office.

3,Thousands take to streets against Tunisian president,Tunisia has been in the throes of an economic downturn and is seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund.,"TUNIS: More than 2,000 Tunisians rallied on Sunday, the country’s independence day, against President Kais Saied and a project he launched to gauge public opinion on proposed constitutional reforms.
Protesters in the capital shouted “the people want to overthrow the president” and “no to consultations”.
The demonstration was organised by the Ennahdha party and a movement named “Citizens Against the Coup” — in reference to a power grab by Saied last year. Many of the demonstrators were people who had voted for Saied, among them blogger and rights activist Mounira Bouazizi.
“I thought that he believed in democracy and the gains of the revolution, but he did the complete opposite,” she said.
Mohammed, a retiree, echoed her, saying: “We cannot call this a democratic process. Today, the people are divided between pro- and anti-Kais Saied. This harms freedom and democracy.”  Sunday’s rally was the latest in a series of demonstrations in the North African country since Saied seized a host of powers after dismissing the government and freezing parliament on July 25.
Critics have dubbed the move a “coup” and rights groups have warned that the country — seen as the only democracy to emerge from the Arab Spring protests — is sliding towards autocracy.
Demonstrators marched on parliament in the Bardo neighbourhood of Tunis, many waving national flags, but a large police deployment blocked their path.
“We will not accept the results of the consultation, this farce against the people,” Samira Chaouachi, the vice president in the frozen parliament, told the crowd.
'Save the country'
Sunday marked the final day of an online poll launched by Saied in January in a process to help rewrite the constitution, with the results set to be presented to a committee of experts. So far only 508,000 people, about seven percent of the seven million eligible voters, have taken part, according to official statistics.
A referendum on the constitutional reforms, which Saied hopes will bolster his authority, is scheduled for July, exactly a year after his power grab, with parliamentary elections scheduled for December.
“Our condolences for the constitution, President Saied,” demonstrators chanted, mocking the low turnout.
President Saied had blamed the low turnout on “technical obstacles” and “attempts by the old system to abort this experiment” — in an apparent reference to his arch rivals Ennahdha.
“We want early presidential and legislative elections,” said Ennahdha member Yamina Zoghlami.
“We are in the midst of a political crisis and we must have a political dialogue to save the country,” she added, warning of a “Lebanese scenario” in the North African country.
Tunisia, like Lebanon, has been in the throes of an economic downturn and is seeking a bailout from the International Monetary Fund, amid rising prices and inflation.
Demonstrators also called for the release of the former head of the bar association, Abderrazek Kilani, arrested early this month on the orders of a military court on charges of “disturbing public order with the intent to obstruct the application of the law”.
Kilani is a member of the defence committee for former justice minister and senior Ennahdha figure Noureddine Bhiri, who has been under house arrest since December.
Earlier this month, 13 international rights groups called on Tunisia to scrap a draft law that would restrict freedoms gained by civil society during the 2011 revolution.

4,Food subsidy scheme launched in BD,"FATULLAH: Bangladesh launched a nationwide food subsidy programme on Sunday after prices for cooking oil, lentils ...","FATULLAH: Bangladesh launched a nationwide food subsidy programme on Sunday after prices for cooking oil, lentils and other staples shot up in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Rising produce costs, which officials blame on wild price fluctuations in the global oil market since the conflict began, have sparked murmurings of discontent around the nation of 170 million people in recent weeks.
Opposition activists have accused traders of profiteering and staged several protest rallies, with a nationwide strike against soaring prices planned for the end of the month.
Commerce ministry chief Tapan Kanti Ghosh said the programme would provide cheap food to 10 million people and run until the end of Ramazan.
“The Ukraine war has increased crude oil prices, which have impacted global commodity prices,” he said.
Hundreds of people were seen queuing in the scorching sun waiting for rations on the first day of the scheme in Fatullah, an industrial centre on the outskirts of Dhaka.
Mosharraf Hossain, a helmsman, said he had to wait for four hours before making his purchase.
“Still it is worthy. The price hike in the regular market is unbelievable,” he added.
Hossain said business owners had told him the “ongoing war near Russia” was the reason they had raised the price of their goods, but he was sceptical.
“Rice, lentils and sugar are mostly produced in our country,” he said. “Is the war here in Bangladesh? This is pure bluff.”

5,Crypto provides fix for some in crisis-hit Afghanistan,"“Crypto is an incredible way to overcome all kinds of political and economic sanctions,"" says expert","HERAT: In the middle of a bazaar in western Afghanistan, Arezo Akrimi takes out her smartphone and, after a few taps of the screen, changes some cryptocurrency for a bundle of hard cash. 
Arezo, 19, is one of a hundred students in Herat receiving around $200 a month in cryptocurrency since September thanks to an American NGO Code To Inspire.
This sum, which she converts at a bureau de change into Afghanis, is crucial for the rent and to help feed her family of six. 
Since the Taliban returned in August, Afghanistan’s economy has virtually collapsed and the country is in the grip of a crisis caused by the seizure of billions of dollars of assets held abroad. 
But digital currencies and their decentralised architecture, impervious to international sanctions, are allowing a handful of young Afghans to avoid the worst of the crisis. 
“It was very surprising for me to learn that this could be used in Afghanistan,” Arezo told AFP. “It was really helpful.” 
Code To Inspire was founded to teach computer programming to women in Herat, but its hi-tech approach is now also helping students get funds in the economically deprived nation. 
Bank transfers to Afghanistan are almost impossible currently, to prevent funds from falling into the hands of fundamentalists. 
But even those with money in a bank struggle to get it out — individuals are limited to withdrawing the equivalent of $200 a week, and businesses $2,000.
Customers have to queue for hours even for those transactions. 
Cryptocurrency transfers have allowed the NGO to circumvent these obstacles while ensuring that each donation gets to those who need it most, founder Fereshteh Forough told AFP. 
“Crypto is an incredible way to overcome all kinds of political and economic sanctions, but also a tool that can change the lives of people living in an authoritarian regime,” says the American, whose parents fled Afghanistan in the 1980s. To guarantee the financial security of its students, the NGO avoids paying them in bitcoins, the best-known cryptocurrency but whose price regularly swings wildly.
Instead, it favours the BUSD, a so-called “stablecoin” whose price is backed by the dollar. “One BUSD is one dollar,” says Forough. 
Crypto coverts 
Beyond this humanitarian initiative, cryptocurrencies are gaining other followers in Herat, according to forex dealer Hamidullah Temori. 
He has seen an influx of new customers over the past six months, many of whom regularly come to convert cryptoassets sent by relatives from abroad into Afghanis.
“Since the Taliban came to power (cryptocurrency) transfers to and from abroad have increased by 80 per cent,” he told AFP. 
Transfers are instantaneous and commissions are much lower than transactions made through Western Union or hawala, the over-the-counter system traditionally favoured by Afghans. 
In Kabul, Noor Ahmad Haidar has become a crypto convert by force of circumstance. 
The young man, who started exporting saffron to the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada in early 2021, now has 90 per cent of his orders paid for in bitcoins.

Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck secured the deal on a visit to Doha as part of efforts to diversify Germany’s energy supply, according to his ministry.
The next step will be for the companies involved to “enter into the concrete contract negotiations”, the spokeswoman said.
Habeck had held talks in Doha with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar, one of the world’s three biggest exporters of liquified natural gas (LNG).
European states are increasingly counting on LNG as a means of weaning themselves off Russian gas in the wake of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
Ahead of his trip, which also includes a visit to the United Arab Emirates, Habeck told a radio network that Germany had major concerns over securing supplies for next winter.
“If we do not obtain more gas next winter and if deliveries from Russia were to be cut, we would not have enough gas to heat all our houses and keep all our industry going,” he warned.
Berlin has come in for criticism over its opposition to an immediate embargo being imposed on Russian energy supplies as a means of choking off a major source of Moscow’s foreign earnings.

According to authorties, the incident did not appear to be a militant attack.
“There are no elements to suggest that the attack had a terrorist motive,” prosecutor Damien Verheyen told a news conference. Police denied media reports the car was involved in a high-speed chase.
The incident occurred in the southern village of Strepy-Bracquegnies at 0400 GMT.
Jacques Gobert, mayor of the neighbouring town of La Louviere, said between 150 and 200 people were gathered to get ready for the annual folklore parade, involving costumes and drums, when the vehicle appeared.
“A speeding car drove into the crowd ... The driver then continued on his way,” said Gobert. 
The two people driving the car, which was later intercepted, were detained. Police said they were local people in their 30s and were not previously known to police.
Belgium has sought to root out people suspected of militant links over the past seven years. 
Ramming vehicles into crowds has become more common as a weapon used by militants in Europe and white supremacists in the United States because such attacks are inexpensive, easy to organise and hard for authorities to prevent, experts say.

8,Transgender outcasts turn artists in India,"“People are very happy to see us working as artists,” said transgender woman artist.","MUMBAI: On a giant flyover in the sprawling Indian metropolis of Mumbai, a transgender art collective is trying to change attitudes as radically as it transforms the concrete pillars into brightly coloured murals.
Known as  “hijras”, individuals identified as male at birth but now part of India’s  “third gender”, have an ambivalent position on the edges of Indian society, respected and feared in turn as some Hindus believe they hold the power to bless or curse.
Denied jobs at most workplaces, many are forced to beg at traffic intersections, where they are a common sight in major cities, or on trains. Some turn up at family events such as weddings or birth celebrations, or at new houses, to offer blessings in return for money, sometimes threatening to issue curses if denied. Others turn to prostitution, increasing their risk of violence.
The Aravani Art Project hopes to challenge the stigma and marginalisation by showing transgender people as artists in the same public spaces where they beg or face abuse.
At the latest mural site — one of Mumbai’s busiest junctions — the team painted portraits of local residents, among them two cleaners, a vegetable seller and a policeman.
“It’s an opportunity for us to show what talent we have,” said transgender woman artist Deepa Kachare.
“We have to beg from people by going to marriage functions, babies’ births, shops, trains, and some of us are sex workers to make money as well,” she said.
“We go everywhere to beg but we love to work hard and earn money.” The organisation — whose projects are commissioned by governments, businesses and NGOs — has brought together dozens of mostly transgender women for street art projects in multiple Indian cities.
“People are very happy to see us working as artists,” said Kachare, 26. “Now they think positively when they see us.”
The art collective takes its name from Lord Aravan, a Hindu deity who is  “wedded” to hundreds of transgender people every year in a southern Indian festival.
Hinduism has many references to  “third genders”, such as Shikhandi, a character in the epic Mahabharata, and hijras have assumed different roles in society over the centuries, among them royal servants and harem guardians, according to historians.

9,Two die in fuel queues as Sri Lanka grapples with shortages,"Sri Lanka is battling the worst economic crisis in its history, with a lack of foreign exchange to purchase vital imports.","COLOMBO: At least two people in Sri Lanka died while waiting in long queues for fuel, officials said on Sunday, as widespread shortages cause misery and hardship across the island nation.
Sri Lanka is battling the worst economic crisis in its history as an independent nation, with a lack of foreign exchange to purchase vital imports shrinking the supply of essential goods.
Motorists are forced to wait hours outside gas stations for petrol and the government has imposed rolling blackouts as power utilities are unable to pay for enough foreign oil to meet demand. Police said a 70-year-old man who was standing in line to buy gasoline collapsed and died at a filling station on the outskirts of the capital Colombo on Sunday.
It was the second such death in as many days, after another elderly man collapsed in Kandy while waiting for kerosene oil to use as cooking fuel, police in the city confirmed.
Local media reports said multiple women standing in the hot sun to buy cooking gas had fainted at several locations across the island over the weekend.

10,UN hopeful of progress at Syria constitution talks,"“Syria remains one of the gravest crises in the world and there is a clear need for progress towards a solution,” says UN envoy.","GENEVA: Talks on a new constitution for Syria resume this week in Geneva, with the United Nations mediator hopeful of making headway.
Back in October, the sixth round of discussions between 15 representatives each from President Bashar al-Assad’s government, the opposition, and civil society, ended with no agreement on how to move things forward.
But UN envoy Geir Pedersen said the two co-chairs — from the government and the opposition — had now come up with an improved procedure for finding common ground on the final day of the talks, which will be on Friday.
“Syria remains one of the gravest crises in the world and there is a clear need for progress towards a political solution,” Pedersen told reporters on Sunday.
The Syrian Constitutional Committee was created in September 2019 and first convened a month later. The tentative negotiations are aimed at rewriting the war-torn country’s constitution. It is hoped the talks could pave the way towards a broader political process.
“The committee should work in a way that builds trust and confidence,” Pedersen said.
“During this session I hope to see the constitutional committee work with a sense of seriousness and purpose and determination to make progress that the situation demands.
“If the three delegations do what they have said they will do, I hope that we can see some steady progress.” 
‘Good meetings’
This seventh round of talks will focus on four principles: the basics of governance; state identity; state symbols; and the structure and functions of public authorities.
The delegates will spend one day working on each principle, before spending Friday trying to concretise any advances made.
Ahmad Kuzbari, the head of the government delegation, and Syrian opposition negotiations leader Hadi al-Bahra, have co-chaired the talks thus far. They traded barbs after October’s sixth round of talks, pointing the finger at each other for the lack of progress.
But Pedersen said the co-chairs had now reached an understanding on how business should proceed on the last day, namely a better mechanism for revisions of proposed constitutional texts.
“I’m looking forward to seeing on Friday how this will be put into practice,” the Norwegian diplomat said.
Pedersen met jointly with the co-chairs on Sunday, during which they decided on the four topics to be discussed this week. That was followed by the three of them holding talks with the 15 civil society representatives.
Pedersen said they were  “good meetings” and  “hopefully that will make it possible for us to make progress through this week”.
Syria’s civil war erupted in 2011 after the violent repression of protests demanding regime change.
It quickly spiralled into a complex conflict that pulled in numerous actors, including jihadist groups and foreign powers. The 
war has left around half a million people dead, displaced millions and devastated its infrastructure. Throughout the civil war, the UN has been striving to nurture a political resolution.

11,"Iran nuclear deal may be finalised in days, officials suggest","“Agreement on the international deal on Iran’s nuclear programme could be reached within 48 hours,” says British daily.","WASHINGTON: The Iranian nuclear deal could be finalised as early as this week, says a British media outlet as rapidly rising oil prices force the West to look beyond Russia.
“Agreement on the international deal on Iran’s nuclear programme could be reached within 48 hours,” Britain’s Independent newspaper reported on Saturday, quoting a senior participant in the deal talks.
Other reports do not give a specific date but claim that the United States and its allies seem ready to finalise the deal as early as possible.
“The revival of the deal first struck in 2005 would pave the way for the end of sanctions on Iran, allowing it to step up oil exports to Western countries seeking to halt their reliance on Russia for energy supplies,” The Independent added.
Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who acts as UN Security Council facilitator at the nuclear talks with Iran in Vienna, told another British media outlet that “the signals are good” for agreement.
“We are getting much closer to signing a deal. In fact, some would say that there are prospects potentially for a deal this weekend” or soon after, Mr Coveney told BBC Radio 4.
The Irish foreign minister explained that western Europe wanted to move away from its reliance on the Russian oil and gas and was looking for other options.
“Iranian crude oil coming back into the market with the removal of sanctions, would be a very attractive prospect in terms of reducing pressure on oil prices,” he added.
A US television channel, CNBC, noted that “with the US terminating its imports of Russian oil and the EU looking to reduce its energy dependency on Moscow, Iranian crude is looking more alluring.”
The report noted that “a return to the 2015 deal would see the return of Iranian oil to the market at a time when crude prices have hit their highest levels in more than a decade.”
Earlier this week, Russia withdrew its threat to torpedo the revival of the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal over the Ukraine-related sanctions, revising hopes for an agreement after nearly a year of talks.
The parties involved in the nuclear agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, were close to a deal in Vienna until the US and EU imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia over its Feb 14 invasion of Ukraine.
Moscow then demanded that future trade with Iran not be impacted by Western sanctions, prompting the talks to be suspended last week.
In their recent statements, Iranian officials indicated that they want the US to remove the designation of their revolutionary guard (IRGC) as a terrorist outfit before the nuclear deal is finalised.
“We are not negotiating in public and are not going to respond to specific claims about what sanctions we would be prepared to lift as part of a mutual return to full implementation of the JCPOA,” said a US State Department official when asked to comment on the demand.
But, he said, “We are prepared to make difficult decisions to return Iran’s nuclear programme to JCPOA limits.
An unrestricted Iranian nuclear programme has led to an escalating nuclear crisis and to greatly increased threats to US citizens, interests, and partners in the region.”

13,Cases of femicide rising sharply in Iraqi Kurdistan,11 women were killed in the first two months of this year...,"SULAIMANIYAH: A woman burned alive by her husband, others shot dead by a father or a teenage brother — bloody violence against women has spiked in northern Iraq’s Kurdish region.
The autonomous area, keen on projecting an image of a relative haven of stability and tolerance in war-battered Iraq, has seen a sharp rise in femicide, killings motivated by gender.
“In the past two months, there has been an increase in femicide compared to the previous year,” said Hiwa Karim Jwamir of the Kurdish General Directorate for Combating Violence Against Women.
In the first two months of 2022, 11 women were killed in autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan, most of them shot, said the official based in Sulaimaniyah.
Forty-five women were killed in 2021, up from 25 the previous year, said Jwamir.

11 women were killed in the first two months of this year

On a Friday before dawn, a 15-year-old teenager was fatally wounded by six bullets fired by her father in the village of Soran. The man told police his daughter “went out with two boys late at night”, according to a domestic violence unit which also records so-called “honour killings”.
Across Iraq, gender-based violence rose 125 per cent to over 22,000 cases between 2020 and 2021, says the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund, which has also pointed to “a worrisome increase in depression and suicide among women and girls”. Last December, a 16-year-old girl was disfigured with acid in Baghdad by an adult who wanted to marry her but had been rejected.
For years, activists have denounced violence against women and forced marriages in Iraq, which remains a conservative and patriarchal society.
“Cases of violence against women are on the rise,” said long-time Kurdistan activist Bahar Munzir, director of local group the People’s Development Organisation.
“Most of the women who are killed are victims of a family member.”
A few days before International Women’s Day on March 8, the body of a 20-year-old woman was found on the side of the road in Arbil, the capital of Kurdistan.
Maria Sami, the victim, was known on social networks for her feminist speeches.
The following day, on March 9, Kirkuk police announced the arrest of the killer, her 18-year-old brother.
While he was still on the run, he spoke by phone to a Kurdish television channel and tried to justify the killing by charging his sister had failed to obey the family. In February, mother-of-two Shinyar Huner Rafiq died in hospital, five days after being admitted with serious burns.
“Her husband had come home one evening in a state of intoxication,” Shinyar’s father, Huner Rafiq, told AFP.
“He doused her body in gasoline and set it on fire.” After the father reported the killing, police arrested the husband. “Before dying, Shinyar told us the facts,” said the bereaved father. “We recorded it, and we submitted the video to the investigators.”
Kurdistan’s prime minister Masrour Barzani denounced the “horrific case”, saying he was “deeply troubled” by the spate of violent attacks against women.
The government must impose “the heaviest possible penalty on perpetrators”, he said in a statement.
“There is no honour in honour killings. I’m determined to protect every woman, girl and child from abuse ... This scourge must end.”
In early February, Dohuk police said they had found the corpse of Doski Azad, a 23-year-old transgender woman who had been ostracised by family members.
An arrest warrant was issued to find the suspected murderer: the victim’s brother, who had in recent years been living in Europe.
He had called his family to inform them of his crime and of where the body was, according to police.
The murder was condemned by the UN mission in Iraq, and the consulates of Western countries in Arbil.
The news provoked a torrent of hatred online — against the victim, even though some voices defended minorities’ rights.
In June 2011, Kurdistan passed a law criminalising domestic violence and female genital mutilation.
The law, which threatens life in prison for “honour” crimes, was hailed by non-governmental groups as a major step forward. But the law’s enforcement is hampered by a climate of impunity and a common fear of speaking out.
“When a woman is killed, the procedures of the security services are not the same as when it’s a man, the trial is not the same,” said Munzir, the activist.
“Some cases don’t even make it to court. They are subject to tribal resolution between the man’s family and that of his wife, the victim.“
