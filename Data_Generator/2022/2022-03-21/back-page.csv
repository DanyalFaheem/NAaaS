0,Power utilities seek up to Rs5 tariff raise,"If approved, rise would negate impact of discount recently announced by PM.","ISLAMABAD: Power utilities have sought permission to raise Rs44 billion additional funds in April by charging Rs3.45 per unit additional fuel cost from the consumers of K-Electric and Rs5 from those of all other distribution companies (Discos). 
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has summoned two separate public hearings on March 31 and April 4 to examine if the demands for higher fuel cost adjustment (FCA) by ex-Wapda Discos and KE are justified. 
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), on behalf of all Discos, has sought more than 117 per cent increase in their FCA to Rs9.2 per unit for electricity sold in January to generate about Rs39bn additional funds. K-Electric has demanded Rs3.45 per unit additional FCA for February to generate about Rs4bn revenue. 
The two demands by the CPPA and KE would effectively negate the impact of Rs5 per unit tariff discount announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan for four months. It has increasingly become common that the reference fuel costs approved by the government and the regulator turn out to be highly unrealistic — a question mark on their economic and financial analytical skills. 

If approved, rise would negate impact of discount recently announced by PM

In recent months, the actual fuel costs have ranged 56pc to 117pc higher than the reference rate. This results in sudden price shocks to consumers on account of monthly fuel adjustments on top of the repeatedly increasing base power tariff apparently at the behest of foreign lenders. 
On behalf of Discos, the CPPA has claimed that consumers were charged a reference fuel cost of Rs4.25 per unit in January, but the actual cost turned out to be Rs9.2 per unit, hence an additional charge of about Rs5 per unit to consumers. 
The higher electricity rates, once approved, would be charged to all consumers in the next billing month (April), except those using less than 50 units per month. 
Data showed that the share of domestic fuel sources in overall power generation in February was robust (46pc). The share of hydropower supply in the overall basket improved to 18.22pc in February against just 5.83pc in January. Hydropower share stood at 20pc in December, 33.2pc in November and 23.26pc in October. Hydropower has no fuel cost. 
As a result, the biggest contribution of over 32pc in overall power supply came from coal-based power plants in February — 1pc lower than its 33pc share in January. The coal-based power generation had only 24pc share in the national grid in December and 16.3pc in November. Its fuel cost also slightly reduced to Rs13.1 per unit in February from Rs14.10 in January. 
This was followed by another major chunk of 15pc fuel generation from LNG, 12.53pc supply from nuclear power, 11.4pc from domestic gas and 6.5pc from furnace oil-based plants in February. 
In comparison, nuclear power plants had contributed 14pc electricity to the national grid in January. The fuel cost of nuclear electricity also increased to Rs1.13 per unit in February against Rs1.075 in January and Rs1.05 in December. The cost of power generation from domestic gas slightly increased to Rs8.12 per unit in February from Rs7.75 in January. The domestic gas produced 13.8pc electricity in December, 13pc in November, 9.67pc in October, 8.9pc in September and 8.17pc in August.

1,Russia bombs art school used as shelter in Mariupol,There was no immediate word on casualties.,"LVIV: Ukrainian authorities said the Russian military bombed an art school where about 400 people had taken refuge in the port city of Mariupol, where Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelensky said an unrelenting siege by Russian troops would go down in history for what he said were war crimes. 
Local authorities said the schools building was destroyed and people could remain under the rubble. There was no immediate word on casualties. 
Russian forces on Wednesday also bombed a theater in Mariupol where civilians were sheltering. City authorities said 130 people were rescued but many more could remain under the debris. A Russian airstrike hit a maternity hospital in Mariupol earlier in the war. 
To do this to a peaceful city, what the occupiers did, is a terror that will be remembered for centuries to come, Zelensky said in a video address to the nation. 
Children, elderly people are dying. The city is destroyed and it is wiped off the face of the earth, Mariupol police officer Michail Vershnin said from a rubble-strewn street in a video addressed to Western leaders that was authenticated by The Associated Press.

2,"Houthis unleash barrage of drone, missile strikes on Saudi Arabia",The attacks did not cause casualties but damaged civilian vehicles and homes in the area.,"DUBAI: Yemen’s Houthi rebels unleashed a barrage of drone and missile strikes on Saudi Arabia early Sunday that targeted a liquefied natural gas plant, water desalination plant, oil facility and power station, Saudi state-run media reported. 
The attacks did not cause casualties, the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen said, but damaged civilian vehicles and homes in the area. The salvo marked the latest escalation in Houthi cross-border attacks on Saudi Arabia as peace talks remain stalled and the conflict that over seven years has laid waste to much of Yemen rages on. 
Top crude exporter Saudi Arabia announced a “temporary reduction” in oil output at a facility run by energy giant Aramco on Sunday following the cross-border attacks which came as state-backed Aramco announced that its profits surged 124 per cent in 2021 to $110 billion, a big jump fueled by renewed anxieties about global supply shortages, soaring oil prices and a recovery in fuel demand from the pandemic. 
Yehia Sarie, a spokesman for Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels, said the group had launched a wide and large military operation into the depth of Saudi Arabia, without immediately elaborating. 
The Saudi-led military coalition said it thwarted an attack on a liquefied gas plant at a petrochemicals complex in the Red Sea port of Yanbu run by Aramco. 
Other aerial strikes targeted a power station in the country’s southwest, a desalination facility in Al-Shaqeeq on the Red Sea coast, an Aramco terminal in the southern border town of Jizan and a gas station in the southern city of Khamis Mushait, the coalition said. 
The extent of damage on Saudi infrastructure and energy facilities remained unclear. The official Saudi Press Agency posted various photos of firetrucks dousing leaping flames with water hoses, as well as wrecked cars and craters in the ground allegedly left by the drone and ballistic missile strikes. 
The barrage comes days after the Saudi-based Gulf Cooperation Council said it invited Yemen’s warring sides for talks in Riyadh aimed at ending the war, an offer dismissed out of hand by the Houthis, who demanded that negotiations take place in a neutral country. 
Peace talks have floundered since the Houthis have tried to capture oil-rich Marib, one of the last remaining strongholds of the Saudi-backed Yemeni government in the country’s north. 
Yemen’s brutal war erupted in 2015, after the Iran-backed Houthis seized the country’s capital, Sanaa, and much of the north. Saudi Arabia and other Arab states launched a devastating air campaign to oust the Houthi threat and restore the internationally recognised government. 
But as the conflict now grinds into its eight year, the violence has only intensified.  The war has created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world and largely settled into a stalemate, with Saudi Arabia and its allies struggling to turn the tide. Coalition airstrikes have decimated infrastructure and struck civilian targets in Yemen like hospitals and wedding parties, drawing widespread international criticism.
