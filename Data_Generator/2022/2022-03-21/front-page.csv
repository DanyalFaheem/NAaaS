0,"IMF seeks details of petrol, power subsidy funding",Finance minister makes it clear there are no more outstanding issues as the IMF only wants to ascertain sources of funding.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought copies of financial agreements with the provincial governments and other details from the federal government to confirm the financing of discounts on electricity and petroleum products announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin disclosed at a press conference on Sunday.
The talks with the IMF were earlier scheduled to conclude on Friday last but then “they [Fund staff] wanted to see agreements with the provinces to basically reassure we are not involved in aerial firing” on financing of PM’s relief package for petroleum prices, the minister said.
Mr Tarin made it clear that there were no more outstanding issues, as they only wanted to ascertain the sources of funding to cover the cost of reduction in electricity and petroleum products. They were assured the package would be covered through provincial shares and dividends of the state-owned entities, he said. “They said show us agreements with the provinces,” he remarked.
The federal government has signed rolling memorandums of understanding with the provinces to provide cash surplus every year to show lower consolidated fiscal deficit but are sometimes remain unhonoured when provinces also go into overdrafts.
“So there is no problem. We already have agreements that we will show them” when the two sides would meet again on Monday, the minister said, adding he would hold a final policy round up with the fund mission on Tuesday. 
The two sides will then finalise the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) amicably and take it to the executive board on a convenient date.
After initial compliance with the commitments made with the IMF in December 2021 to increase petroleum levy and power tariff, PM Khan reversed the progress by announcing Rs10 per litre reduction in petroleum products bringing down levy to zero besides a cut in electricity rates by Rs5 per unit instead of a schedule of increases agreed to with the IMF to address circular debt.
Up to 700,000-tonne wheat import
Responding to a question, Mr Tarin said all the provinces were part of the minimum wheat support price at Rs2,200 per 40 kg approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet last week — about 13 per cent higher than Rs1,950 of last year and showed confidence to exceed procurement target that was also set at 6.9 million tonnes last week.
He said the wheat production was then estimated to be 5pc to 6pc higher and may not require imports except 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes for strategic reserves. “I would like to increase strategic reserves from 1.8 million tonnes to two million tonnes, depending on international prices,” he said, adding he would not burn foreign exchange if international wheat prices remain higher.
In response to a question about former PML-N finance minister Miftah Ismail’s statement that the country could not launch international bonds as Pakistan’s bond yields had gone high due to economic policies and fundamentals, Mr Tarin said his statement would not change ground reality. This was not Pakistan specific but with entire developing countries including Turkey, Indonesia and others, he remarked.
Mr Tarin said financing was not an issue but the interest rates being offered were higher. He said he still had $4-5bn worth of offers from banks, but “why should I take expensive loans?” Mr Miftah should also recall they had left the government with just one-month import financing that now stood at $16.6bn – against average monthly imports of about $7bn in eight months, he added.
Responding to a question whether he would continue as finance minister in the next government if asked, Mr Tarin said he was a man of principles and would at no cost do that as he was a PTI senator. “I will remain finance minister if the PTI government stays, otherwise will go home. I am not a renegade,” he said.
He expressed the hope that 5pc economic growth rate was expected despite various headwinds this year, as some sectors were also showing robust growth including large-scale manufacturing, agriculture and exports. “This shows there is thrust in the economy and momentum is returning,” he said, adding that this did not mean there were no headwinds but policy adjustments would continue to absorb them.
“The welcome news is that the LSM has grown by 8.2pc in January against same month of last year and 4.2pc against December 2021,” he said, adding the LSM growth had slowed down in August and September 2021 but the trend had reversed. “Our economic growth momentum has picked up again as all agriculture crops are growing at 6 to 12 percent, and exports and services sectors are also growing at a high pace,” the minister pointed out.

1,NA speaker summons no-trust session on 25th,"Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ""sale and purchase"".","ISLAMABAD: In an apparent move to prolong the voting on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan, National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Sunday summoned the session of the lower house of parliament on March 25, violating the Constitution under which he is bound to convene a session within 14 days after the submission of a requisition. 
Meanwhile, the government also took a significant decision under which it will file a reference in the Supreme Court on Monday (today), seeking “an opinion” of the apex court on two main points — whether the disqualification of a legislator is for life time and whether the dissident MNAs of any party can cast vote on a no-confidence resolution. 
The speaker, who under the Constitution was bound to call the NA session by March 21 [within 14 days after the opposition’s requisition], gave an excuse that since the three-day conference of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would be held in the NA hall, there was no other place in the federal capital to convene the NA session. 
This is despite the fact that the capital offers alternative locations where such an event can be held such as the spacious Jinnah Convention Centre, Prime Minister Secretariat, Pak-China Centre, two five-star hotels, etc. 

Government to file reference in SC today to end politics of ‘sale and purchase’

The opposition lashed out at the speaker for his decision to hold the NA session on March 25, saying he had violated the Constitution to prolong the voting on no-trust motion. 
Sources in the government told Dawn that the decisions to hold the NA session on March 25 and filing of the reference in the Supreme Court were taken at a meeting presided over by Prime Minister Khan at his Banigala residence on Sunday. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser issued an order saying the [opposition’s] requisition was received on March 8 for summoning the National Assembly. Whereas, on Jan 21, 2022, a motion had been adopted by the NA to allow the exclusive use of NA chamber for the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers scheduled for March 22, 23 or any other date. 
He said the renovation work on the NA chamber and its lobbies had commenced on the requirement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the end of February 2022, which was under taken by the Capital Development Authority. 
The speaker said that after the receipt of [the opposition’s] requisition, the NA Secretariat requested the Senate Secretariat to provide chamber of the Senate for holding the NA session, but the latter pointed out that the Senate chamber was also not available for being under renovation. 
“Thereafter, the CDA chairman and deputy commissioner, Islamabad, were also approached to arrange and provide a suitable building for holding the session of the National Assembly outside the parliament building, at Islamabad. However, they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad for holding the NA session,” Mr Qaisar added. 
“In view of the aforementioned facts and circumstances, it is evident that no suitable place would be available for holding the session of the NA till March 24. Having no adequate option available whatsoever, for holding of the NA session before March 24, therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under clause (3) of Article 54 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, read with Article 254 of the Constitution, I hereby summon the session of the National Assembly on the first available date i.e. Friday, March 25 at 11.00am at the Parliament House, Islamabad,” the order said. 
Meanwhile, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said in a tweet that the government would file a reference in the Supreme Court that would end the politics of “sell and purchase” and diminish the influence of “easy money” and “influence in politics”. 



 
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the decision to file the reference was taken by the prime minister in a meeting on Sunday. “The basic reasons of filing the reference are — to know whether the disqualification of any legislators is for lifetime and that can PTI dissidents cast vote on the no-trust motion,” he added. 
A source said the NA speaker could call the session on March 21 to meet the constitutional requirement [within 14 days after the requisition] and adjourn the session for three days for the OIC conference and it could resume on March 24. 
According to Article 63 of the Constitution, the prime minister is given three days after the tabling of a no-trust motion, for preparation. However, the government is apparently trying to linger on the voting on the motion — first by an excuse of “lack of suitable place for the session till March 25” and then filing of the reference in the Supreme Court. 
The information minister said the government was only seeking an opinion of the apex court and it could be given by the court even on the first day of filing of the reference or the court could take more time it deemed appropriate. 
Asked why the NA session was not called on March 21, he said the NA hall was not available for the session due to the OIC summit.

2,Opposition calls for Asad Qaiser’s trial under Article 6,"PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ""anti-Pakistan"" drive.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: Opposition parties on Sunday slammed National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for not convening the assembly session within 14 days of its requisition to take up their no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan, demanding that he should be tried under Article 6 of the Constitution.
The opposition parties also lashed out at the PM for, what they called, using the religion card in an effort to save his government and accused his party of launching a ‘propaganda campaign’ through its social media team against the army over its ‘neutrality’.
Speaking at a news conference, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari expressed the hope that the Supreme Court would take notice of the violation of the Constitution by the speaker, proving that there was at least one institution in the country for the protection of the Constitution, democracy and right of the vote of the parliamentarians. 
Stating that the job of the SC was to protect and implement the Constitution, the PPP chairman hoped that the court “will not facilitate this government on its unconstitutional step” and that it would make a constitutional decision, not a political one. 

PTI accused of running social media campaign against army; PML-Q wants PM to take notice of ‘anti-Pakistan’ drive

“We appreciate how the SC sent a message of standing with the law and Constitution, even on a weekend,” he said in an apparent reference to the hearing of a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association during which the court had reprimanded the government over the attack by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Sindh House. 
He said the SC was already hearing a petition that had not been filed by them, but the bar association. However, he said the court had issued notices to the political parties as well in the case and they would present their viewpoint before it. 
“This coward captain [the PM] is running away from the vote of no confidence. He is escaping to the extent that he has made the speaker abrogate the Constitution,” the PPP chairman observed. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari lashed out at PM Khan for using Islam for party politics and asked him not to use the slogan of Madinah state. 
“You (the PM) are the foreign-sponsored and foreign-funded agent who has been planted in our system,” he said while criticising the government’s foreign policy. He alleged that the prime minister had been given the task to damage the country’s foreign policy and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and that he had done it “beautifully”. 
He accused Mr Khan of adopting the foreign policy of India, stating that there was no difference in the foreign policies of the two countries. 
Addressing a separate news conference, PML-N’s senior vice-president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also accused the speaker and the premier of violating the Constitution and committing treason under Article 6 which, he said, was not a joke. He said if anyone would interfere in the democratic process of no-trust move, he would commit ‘treason’. 
PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal alleged that Mr Khan was using religion card to cover up his “dirty politics and incompetence”. 
Earlier, in a statement, PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb stated if the speaker failed to convene the NA session before March 22, he would be guilty of violating the Constitution that was be punishable under Article 6. 
Campaign against institutions
During the news conference, the PPP chairman also alleged that the PM and his social media team had launched a ‘propaganda campaign’ to ‘provoke’ an institution so that it could not remain ‘neutral’. 
“When a time has come when the media is talking about a neutral environment, Imran and his social media team are trying to spread the propaganda that institutions are not neutral, be it through provocation or creating a constitutional crisis,” he said.
“It is the responsibility of all of us to demand and try for every institution to work within its domain drawn by the law and Constitution, and to criticise when this does not happen. However, it is also our responsibility to oppose the prime minister, his social media team and its members who are provoking and targeting an institution under a conspiracy,” he added.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the prime minister had equated the term ‘neutral’ with animals and had still not apologised to the nation over it. “Our efforts have always been for neutrality. The PM, his social media team and ministers are making desperate attempts to tarnish neutrality. We condemn this,” he said without elaborating.
The PPP chairman, who had not named the institution during his press conference, later asked the Inter-Service Public Relations and the judiciary to take notice of the propaganda campaign by the PM, his social media team and the MNAs aimed at getting “the status of neutrality” changed.
Though Mr Bhutto-Zardari did not give any reference to the army when he talked about the allegation regarding the propaganda campaign against neutrality, the PML-Q and the PML-N came out more openly when they castigated the PTI government for hitting out at army and Inter-Service Intelligence by a party’s woman MNA and an important member of the PTI’s media team. 
A video clip with the audio of PTI MNA Kanwal Shauzeb shared from a twitter space “Current political situation” went viral on social media in which she could be heard apparently talking about military establishment. “They have nothing to do with performance and neither they want to manage the country. They had never done it in the past, then why will they do it now. Actually, they wanted to hijack the system and working on an agenda of minus-Imran Khan,” she said in the clip, adding that the real issue was that the premier was not allowing those sitting in “different institutions and all kinds of institutions to continue their loot and plunder” and “that’s why they are now having panic attacks”.
Since Saturday afternoon, an unusual debate has started on Twitter with a host of people, apparently the PTI supporters, trying to make the army leadership controversial by levelling all kinds of accusations. They were found accusing the army chief of trying to undermine the government and the present system. 
In response, several people also came out in support of the armed forces, blaming the present government of maligning the armed forces and its chief.
Reacting over the clip, PML-Q MNA Chaudhry Salik Hussain tweeted: “The PTI’s social media team and a woman MNA levelled false allegations on the Pakistan Army and the ISI, which are unacceptable and unbearable.” 
Mr Hussain demanded that the PM must take notice of this “dirty anti-Pakistan campaign, otherwise, the PML-Q knew well how to deal with the anti-Pakistan elements”.



 
Also, the official spokesman for PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif, Malik Ahmad Khan, tweeted that the PTI social media team would not be allowed to defame the Pakistan Army. “The state’s existence gets threatened when a state army’s central authority is compromised,” he said. 



 
“When a state will not respect the status of the institution of army, can a state survive?” he asked in a linked tweet. “The strong army is a guarantor of strong Pakistan,” the spokesman said, adding that every Pakistani was ready to sacrifice his life for country’s solidarity and progress.

3,Jahangir Tareen group sees their demands being met,A senior party leader in Punjab says the PM has agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wants the dissident group to wait for a while.,"LAHORE: Members of the dissident Jahangir Tareen group in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appear confident they will have their way after securing guarantees that the chief minister of Punjab will be removed from office.
Sources in the group told Dawn that Prime Minister Imran Khan had all but “agreed” to accept the demands of the dissident group, but has sought more time to remove Chief Minister Usman Buzdar in order to “avert the impression of being blackmailed”.
Shaken by a no-confidence motion against the premier, the PTI government is on a mission to mend ways with party dissidents. A senior delegation of government members met the Jahangir Tareen group and asked them to explain their concerns and demands in detail.
“The Tareen group remains adamant over the removal of Usman Buzdar and explained their concerns with regards to victimisation, lukewarm response from Chief Minister Office to their problems and the bureaucracy’s attitude towards their group members,” a source in the Tareen group told Dawn.
A senior party leader in Punjab told Dawn the prime minister had agreed to remove CM Buzdar but wanted the dissident group to wait for a while, because an immediate acceptance of the demand would be exploited by the opposition as if “Imran Khan has bowed down to dissidents’ blackmail”.
The PTI government had also conveyed that the new chief minister would be from PTI parliamentarians, the senior party leader said, adding that the Tareen group assured the government team that it did not want to leave the party until it would be compelled to do so.
Problems being resolved
Meanwhile, key Tareen group member Lala Tahir Randhawa said a government team led by cabinet minister Murad Raas had called on the group and agreed to resolve problems that could be addressed through the administration.
Since the government team had been given two days to resolve the parliamentarians’ issue, Mr Randhawa said a response had started to come, as deputy commissioners, district police officers and other government officials were calling all group members to address their problems.
He said that actions taken to victimise him and provincial minister Ajmal Cheema were also being undone. “The government team will return with its problems’ resolution report and the group will meet on Wednesday to take a final decision,” he added.
Mr Randhawa asserted that the group’s main demand was “minus-Buzdar” because the incumbent chief minister had ruined the governance system in the country. “Another large group of MPAs have also contacted the Tareen group and expressed support for its demand of removing Buzdar from Punjab’s chief ministership,” Mr Randhawa revealed.
Answering a question about PTI dissident and former senior minister Abdul Aleem Khan’s conduct with the group after visiting it at Jahangir Tareen’s residence, Mr Randhawa said Aleem Khan did come and a five-member committee was constituted — including Mr Randhawa, Nauman Langrial, Abdul Hayee Dasti and Ajmal Cheema — to coordinate with Aleem Khan. However, Aleem Khan did not call the committee and he alone met Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, who visited him on the instructions of the prime minister.
Sources said the government had conveyed to the Tareen group that CM Buzdar would be replaced by another senior leader within the party and four names have started doing the rounds in the PTI parliamentarians’ circle, including those of provincial minister Raja Yasir Humayun, Murad Raas, Mian Aslam Iqbal and Asif Nakai.
Tareen group members told Dawn that 13 of their 17 MPAs were elected as independents and later joined the party. “Even if the Tareen group decided to vote against PM Imran Khan in the centre and CM Buzdar in Punjab, the government would not be able to de-seat them because they were not elected on PTI tickets,” Mr Randhawa told Dawn.
Tareen ‘held party together’
Meanwhile, Jahangir Tareen’s spokesman Awn Chaudhry said some eight MNAs were standing with the group and take a decision about supporting or not supporting the government in the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
“I was personally disturbed when I saw that several MNAs stood against the party,” he said and added that it all happened because PM Khan pushed away Jahangir Tareen, who was actually keeping all MNAs intact with the party.
“Mr Tareen used to help the prime minister in difficult times and resolve party parliamentarians’ problems,” he said and asked whether the PTI should not hold the premier’s political aides accountable for all this mess.
Answering a question whether Jahangir Tareen could enter into any deal with the PML-N, he said he could not comment on his leader’s behalf. “Whatever Jahangir Tareen will decide, his whole group will go along his decision,” he asserted.

4,RED ZONE FILES: All set for a collision course,Some govt officials have started to acknowledge in private that prospects of surviving this challenge from opposition are slim.,"Political entanglements may once again be headed to the courts. 
Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned the crucial session of the National Assembly on Friday, March 25, which is three days longer than the Constitution has stipulated once the required number of parliamentarians have requisitioned a session. This order further complicates a situation that is fraught with danger and uncertainty. Here’s where things stand today and what they could portend in the coming days:

The PTI government is doing legal gymnastics with constitutional procedures, but there is no way around the vote of no-confidence against Prime Minister Imran Khan. The only way that the PM can retain his job is if the opposition fails to muster a strength of 172 in the lower house during the vote. Or if for some reason, the opposition withdraws the motion. There is no other way out for the PM and his cabinet. Legal experts say the speaker may attempt to delay the process and push the vote forward, and this may ultimately end up in courts, but the vote will need to take place one way or another. What matters is the numbers game. Everything else is a side show.
The courts may in fact become the battleground before the real battle on the floor of the National Assembly. If both the government and the opposition head to the Supreme Court with their petitions, the court may need to pronounce on the following: (i) if Article 63 of the constitution allows the party head to stop errant members of his party from voting on the confidence motion (ii) if the disqualification under Article 3 for members indulging in floor crossing can be a lifetime ban (iii) if the speaker can delay summoning of the National Assembly for more than the two-week limit spelt out in the Constitution and whether he can somehow delay the moving of the motion for the vote of no confidence. 
These issues will be addressed by the Supreme Court this week and a lot will depend on how long the SC takes to pronounce a decision. According to legal experts, if the SC reaffirms the obvious interpretation of the constitutional procedure for the vote of no-confidence, then the government will have no other option but to fight the numbers game, which it appears to be losing at this stage.
The planned rallies by the government and the opposition on Sunday, March 27, have added an explosive element to the volatile situation. Inside the Red Zone, there is a genuine fear that if these rallies are allowed to take place as scheduled, then there is a danger of violence breaking out. Now, imagine the real danger: when such violence ensues between a sitting government and its opponents, what does the police do? And if the police cannot handle such a scenario, the only option is what Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has been referring to in his speeches: handing over security responsibility to the armed forces.
There is no need for the situation to deteriorate to such a level. But it is being dragged towards such an outcome by the government itself. What is otherwise a straightforward constitutional procedure is being weaponised by the use of mobs and threats. These in turn are being used to fuel a new narrative that focuses on accusations of horse-trading as a means to undermine a democratic process. What is being deliberately ignored is that such allegations need to be proved in a court of law for any action to be taken. They are handy for political sloganeering but cannot be used to counter what is purely a constitutional and legal process.
The government allies have stitched up their agreements with the opposition but according to Red Zone insiders, they will hold back formal announcements till after the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting. Despite the ups and downs of this week and the increase in political temperatures, the PML-Q, MQM and BAP are still locked into an understanding whose final details are being stitched up. One parliamentarian from the allied parties said their decision was intact as per the understanding reached.
One key challenge for the opposition is to keep its members safe, secure and available in Islamabad. This has led to daily congregations for dinners where the leaders keep an eye on their flock while also ensuring that none are under any pressure or facing threats. Opposition insiders say this is harder than it sounds as these elected members have a strong gravitational pull from their constituencies and yet cannot be allowed to disperse from Islamabad at a crucial time when every single vote counts.
While it is clear that the vote of no confidence will take place in a matter of days, there remain some uncertainties that are becoming a source of concern: (i) if PM Khan is on a collision course – as is evident from his speeches, including the one on Sunday – is there a way the system can be saved from instability without the opposition ceding space to him? (ii) Will the establishment be forced to intervene if matters start to spin out of control (iii) what will happen if the PM decides to use the ‘nuclear option’ of firing a senior official and appointing a new one in his place?
Some senior government officials have started to acknowledge in private that their prospects of surviving this challenge from the opposition are slim. They are now also admitting that the root cause of the dire situation they find themselves in today is the unnecessary and avoidable confrontation with the establishment. 
Yet they are now locked into a predicament that can only reinforce itself if the PTI government falls. The narrative being stitched together by the party leadership will likely further accentuate the source of the conflict and could trigger greater political instability.

The Red Zone is under stress. The coming ten days will determine if it can sustain it.
