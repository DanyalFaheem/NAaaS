0,Committee set up to identify officers involved in leasing out Monal Restaurant,"Body asked to assess the transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease.","ISLAMABAD: A four-member committee has been formed by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to identify officers who were involved in processing and leasing out Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP). 
This has been done in compliance with the orders of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Jan 12, 2022. According to a notification issued by the CDA’s Confidential Wing, the committee is supposed to complete its task within 15 days “so that disciplinary proceedings could be initiated against the delinquent officers/officials”.
Sources in the wing said Deputy Director General Land and Estate Afnan Alam would head the committee while Deputy Financial Adviser Khawaja Aizad Hussain, Director Laboratory Khalid Nawaz and Director Regional Planning Fraz Malik will be its members.

Body asked to assess transparency of bidding process, comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration

The notification of the committee, which was issued on March 10, and is available with Dawn, tasked the committee to “identify officer involved in processing/leasing of land/structure of Monal Restaurant in the protected area of National Park in violation of the Act of 1997, Ordinance of 1960, Ordinance of 1966, Ordinance of 1979 and the regulations made under the respective statutes”.
According to the terms of reference (TORs), the committee has been given the task to identify factors behind construction of Monal Restaurant and other buildings in the protected area as it was in violation of various acts and ordinances.
The committee has been directed to “assess the transparency of bidding process for leasing of Monal to a private entity and comparison of rent rates offered by the lease and accepted by the then CDA administration with the then market prices for facilities of similar size and nature, identify/mention relevant provision of laws and regulations, infringed while allowing construction/lease of the Monal Resturant and to ascertain the loss/ damages to wildlife, flora and fauna and environmental changes in National Park due to said construction of the restaurant”.
While hearing a petition related to Monal Restaurant, the IHC in January this year had ordered the CDA and Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) to seal the building and start proceedings against other buildings that were operating in the national park in violation of rules.
Following the said orders, the CDA and ICT administration sealed the restaurant.
However, the Supreme Court on March 9, suspended the Jan 11 IHC judgement of sealing and taking over possession of the restaurant.
“The unsigned order of the IHC will remain suspended,” ordered a three-judge Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan. Consequently, Monal Restaurant was de-sealed.
The court, which had taken up the appeal of Monal Group of Companies, pointed out why no action was taken against the other 13 restaurants situated in close proximity of Monal and why Monal was discriminated against only and on what basis, its possession was taken over without the certified copy of the high court.
The IHC had ordered the CDA and IWMB to take over forthwith the possession of the restaurant and seal its premises, subject to allowing its owner/management to take out their property. 
The CDA, after construction of the restaurant, had leased it out to a private firm for 15 years and the lease agreement expired last year. 
However, a few years before the expiry of agreement, the lessee started paying rent to the military, which stated that the land where Monal was constructed belonged to them in accordance with a notification issued in 1912.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah rejected the military ownership’s claim over the land and ordered recovery of all the rent paid by the Monal Restaurant management. 
The court had also asked the defence ministry to ensure that the amount received as rent was deposited in the exchequer.
“The claim of Remount, Veterinary and Farms Directorate of Pakistan Army, regarding 8,068 acres of land in the notified national park area is in 
violation of the Ordinance of 1979, read with the Ordinance of 1960, and the [Islamabad] Master Plan,” the IHC had declared.
The IHC chief justice had also directed civic agencies to seal the sprawling naval golf course located in the national park area and unless an environmentally-friendly use can be found for it, ordered its demolition within four weeks.
A senior CDA officer confirmed that the inquiry committee had been formed and added that the committee was yet to hold its first meeting.

The statement of traffic police stated that SSP Rai Mazhar proposed to the Capital Development Authority to make the highway signal free.
The project has saved Rs7.5 billion as instead of constructing overhead bridges, the corridor was made signal free by constructing protected U-turns. 
The data of the police showed that over 115,000 vehicles enter and leave from Islamabad Chowk to Zero Point. As they will travel on the signal-free corridor, it will save around 100,000 man hours of people.
On an average four people travel in a vehicle so if each vehicle saves 15 minutes the entire saving of time of four persons will be one hour, the statement said.
Chief Commissioner Islamabad Amer Ali Ahmed had appreciated the proposal of SSP traffic and directed immediate implementation of the proposal. 
Now the Srinagar Highway has been made signal free by constructing three protective U-turns that connected Islamabad and Rawalpindi with the new airport.
All foreign guests and dignitaries use this road while travelling to and from the airport.
The duration of the travel to Islamabad airport would reduce to half.
This will help solve traffic jam by 60 to 70pc while travelling time to Islamabad airport will also reduce considerably, the SSP (Traffic) said.

3,Islamabad sees decline in Covid-19 mortality rate,Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance,"ISLAMABAD: As vaccination against Covid-19 has surpassed the figure of 90pc in the federal capital, the city has seen a reduction in mortality rate.
According to data, only 133 cases were reported in the city during the last one week, with the positivity ratio remaining at 1pc. 
On the other hand, Rawalpindi reported five positive cases on Sunday.
In another development, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) launched a report on Sunday that covered Pakistan’s Covid-19 response during January-February 2022.

Fafen’s findings stress the need for continued vigilance

During the last few weeks, the fifth wave of the pandemic has been losing severity in the country, which can be gauged from the fact that the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has decided to lift all restrictions for fully-vaccinated people.
Talking to Dawn, District Health Officer Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia said though the city had surpassed the figure of 90pc, in terms of complete vaccination, it should be considered around 95pc as a number of residents of the city were outside the country.
“The reduced mortality rate shows credibility of vaccination in the city. Despite the fact that Islamabad has a large number of medical tourism, the mortality rate is almost zero,” he added.
While sharing the weekly data, Dr Zia said in the last week of January, the city observed the highest positivity rate of 16.45pc which then gradually started to decline, reaching 1pc during the last week.
The data showed that on Sunday, the capital reported 21 Covid-19 patients and the infection rate of 1.32pc.
Meanwhile,five people tested positive in Rawalpindi district and four recovered during the last 24 hours.
According to the health authority’s data, the positivity ratio in the district was 0.56pc. A total of 892 samples were collected out of which results of 887 people came back negative.
There are 76 active patients in Rawalpindi district as of March 20, with three patients admitted to hospitals and 73 home isolated.
Two patients surfaced from the cantonment areas and one patient each from Kallar Syedan, Taxila and Islamabad. There is no patient on ventilator, however one is on oxygen and the other two are stable.
On the other hand, a report of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) has observed varying healthcare capacities across regions and districts during the fifth wave of Covid-19 that remained a major challenge and key concern.
With the onset of Omicron variant in December last year, confirmed cases jumped to 133,839 in January – the highest since the start of the pandemic – while the number of recoveries was recorded at 38,366.
Compared to January, cases started to decline in February. The health authorities recorded 79,855 confirmed cases and 147,548 recoveries in the month.
Fafen’s findings of the third pandemic governance monitoring report, released on Sunday, reinforced the need for consistent and continued vigilance and the necessity of both medium and long-term structural and policy changes built on the lessons learnt.
Compared to the earlier waves, the report highlighted a broad two-pronged pandemic response to the fifth surge of Covid-19 that helped Pakistan withstand and manage the challenges relatively well.
The first aspect of the response comprised varying levels of restrictions and targeted measures in areas with high positivity ratio.
The second wave comprised a parallel push for increased vaccination and broadening the eligible population section to include the 12-16 age group. A remarkable increase of 30 million to the fully vaccinated column during the first two months of the ongoing year is a testament to the seriousness accorded to the effort, the report said. 
Despite a slow start, Pakistan’s vaccination drive gained significant momentum, reaching an average of one million doses per day by the end of last year.
Pakistan had administered 216.9 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine by the first week of March 2022. Approximately 100 million people were fully vaccinated (65pc of the vaccine eligible population and 44pc of the total estimated population), whereas around 127.5 million are ‘partially vaccinated’ as per the information provided by the NCOC website and their official twitter account.
As assessed in the report, had the Omicron variant been as severe as the earlier variants, it would have seriously tested the healthcare system — a factor that shall not be lost on policymakers responsible for responding to any new variant of Covid-19 or a completely new pandemic.
For instance, the availability of beds, ventilators and doctors within the observed districts showed that the healthcare system in Pakistan was still under-equipped — more so in some areas than others.
If the situation had necessitated the hospitalisation of those infected, the number of patients per ventilator and patients per bed would have resulted in severe consequences for some of the districts.
For instance, Karak district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would have 21,132 and 1,023 patients per ventilator and bed respectively, followed by Mardan with 669 patients per ventilator and 324 patients per bed, and Rawalpindi with 204 patients per ventilator and four patients per bed.
The private sector has played a significant role in providing services and facilities that have contributed to the overall pandemic governance and response. However, there remains the need for more effective regulation, especially regarding the pricing of critical services.
However, what remains a key concern for the government is the issue of price regulation.
Attendants of patients interviewed at various health facilities highlighted the significant variance in test pricing. The respondents claimed to have paid prices ranging between Rs1,000 and Rs15,000 or more.

This was pointed out by retired Major Gen Rehmat Khan, president of Al-Shifa Trust, while speaking at the signing ceremony of an agreement between the Al-Shifa Trust and the Government of Gambia. 
It has been signed to provide short-term specialised professional training to doctors and deserving patients from the African nation.
Both parties will also work together to offer ophthalmic services via telemedicine facility available at the trust’s eye hospitals.
Telemedicine allows healthcare providers to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients and it can also be used to take exams, Mr Khan said, adding that Al-Shifa will also ensure remote patient monitoring, also known as tele-monitoring, that allows patients to be monitored in their homes using mobile devices that collect data about temperature, blood sugar levels, blood pressure or other vital signs.
“We are very pleased to extend our services beyond borders and this new collaboration is the first step in this regard which is very encouraging,” he said, adding the hospital has already decided to expand its outreach to countries that are members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to build their capacity, prevent blindness and provide them timely eye care.
We will put our best efforts in upgrading the skills of doctors and paramedical staff hailing from Organisation of Islamic Cooperation countries through distant learning which in turn will enable them to serve the patients in a better way, he said.
The visiting delegation included Minister Dr Lamin, Madam Janneh Kaira, Director General Pharmaceutical Services Babanding Sablly, Deputy Director (Health) Dr Snyassi, Focal Person Madam Misbah Sadiq, and Abdullah.
Members of the visiting delegation lauded the services of the trust and thanked their management for cooperation. 
They said that a meeting with the trust’s officials was very productive and hoped that it will go a long way in serving humanity.

Talking to Dawn, the minister said a fully funded Annual Development Programme (ADP) of Rs1.4 billion was approved for the construction of the university campus. He said the project was the joint ownership of the city as locals contributed funds towards raising different buildings.
The foundation of UoC was laid by Prime Minister Imran Khan near Balkasar area two years ago, which is nearing completion, Mr Sarfraz said.
The request for establishment of the city campus was also submitted to the Punjab government so that students of Chakwal city did not travel 16km to Balkasar daily, he said.
The PC-I for the city campus has been approved and Rs1.4 billion allocated for the construction of the campus, the minister said.
“Two academic blocks, an admin block and male and female hostels would be built and renovation carried out with the fund,” the provincial minister said, adding that construction of the city campus would be completed by 2024.
“The Ministry of Higher Education was my favourite portfolio that has played a constructive role in the establishment of a public university in Chakwal. The engineering campus of the university in Balkasar is under construction and is expected to finish by the next year,” Mr Sarfraz said.
“Campuses of the university would be spread in different areas of Chakwal including Chakwal city, Balkasar and Murid. Land is being acquired in Murid area of Chakwal for construction of several facilities. The vision for this university is to have 30,000-40,000 students and to be an exemplary university of the Rawalpindi Division,” he said, adding that there was no major public university in the division like Lahore, Multan and Faisalabad.
He said: “Many intelligent female students from different areas of Chakwal were deprived of higher education as they were not allowed to get admissions in far-off cities. Now, those students would benefit the most as they can get higher education near their homes. To further create educational facilities for female students who cannot study in co-educational institutions due to conservative backgrounds, female government colleges in Chakwal and Talagang have been affiliated with the UoC and upgraded for BS programmes.”

In a statement, Mr Niazi maintained that hosting the second OIC sitting in a short span of time was a great diplomatic achievement of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
“Pakistan is now [placed] in a better position at the diplomatic front owing to Prime Minister Imran Khan’s pragmatic policies,” he said. 
Terming inclusion of Kashmir issue in the agenda of the OIC conference as a significant development, the AJK premier however voiced serious concern over the world community’s silence at the sufferings of the people of Palestine and India-occupied Kashmir.  
Urging the international community to shun its “policy of indifference” towards the problems confronting the Muslim world, he said it was high time that the international community and influential world governments came forward and played their role in resolution of the issues of Kashmir and Palestine.
The AJK prime minister maintained that under the prevailing circumstances there was a dire need for unity and harmony among the Muslim states in the larger interest of the Ummah.
While unity among the Muslim nations was sine qua non for resolution of Kashmir and Palestine issues, the global peace was also inescapably linked with the just settlement of both issues, he said.

12,"Another body set up to curb celebratory fire, kite flying","Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action","RAWALPINDI: In the wake of the decision of the Provincial Bird Hazard Control Committee (PBHCC), another body comprising representatives of the district administration, district police, Solid Waste Management Company and Nur Khan Air Base has been formed to effectively eliminate hazards such as celebratory firing, kite flying, pigeon homing and solid waste disposal.
In a letter to City Police Officer (CPO) Omer Saeed Malik, the provincial committee expressed its concern over the menace of celebratory firing and suggested that strict action needed to be taken by the police.
In its recent meeting, the committee discussed preventive measures related to March 23, 2022, when an increased number of aircraft will be flying from different Pakistan Air Force (PAF) bases. Safe flying operations during the fly past are of utmost importance, the members emphasised.

Provincial committee had expressed concern over the menace, suggested strict police action

It was also recommended that the authorities concerned conduct regular surveys and take swift action against all garbage dumps and place a strict ban on wasting food and other similar items, especially within 12 to 15 kilometres around airfields and airports.
Bird control is the responsibility of the airport management since bird shooters are deployed in the area, particularly near runways, and other preventative steps usually need to be taken to avoid any mishap.
“Since celebratory firing has become a real menace to the security of airspace, strict action has to be taken against it,” the committee stated, adding that a survey of marriage halls should be conducted and it should be made sure that there is no celebratory fire in the wake of important events taking place at the venue of the March 23 fly past and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) council of foreign ministers conference.
The CPO Rawalpindi was also asked to take strict action against firing in the air and to submit a report to the office of commissioner Rawalpindi on a fortnightly basis.
The Punjab government had already asked law enforcement agencies to execute Section 144 and devise a strategy to implement a policy on pigeon homing, kite flying, use of laser lights and drones near airbases and airports.
Following the increasing trend of kite flying, the PBHCC had been formed in March 2020 which had held its first meeting under the chair of the chief secretary of Punjab in Lahore.
Besides monitoring celebratory firing, the district police have been taking strict action against kite flyers and have seized a number of kites and arrested many sellers during ongoing crackdown.
When asked about the security level put in place in the city regarding defence day, the CPO said: “The security has been placed at red-alert level, though there has been no specific threat but we are not taking it lightly as doing all possible security measures, including conducting search operations, specifically in border areas.”
All the stake holders had been intimated by the committee to nominate their representatives for the other committee so that effective measures should be taken to prevent celebratory firing.

The event was organised by RED Media. Organisers said the event was a platform of multicultural exchange and business. 
The IFFP 2022 was fundraising for charity with Voices Society, which is an organisation that worked for the benefit of differently-abled people. 
Designers, included Nina Naustdal, whose philosophy is ‘normal is boring’. All her pieces were handcrafted. Her premise was reflected in all her dresses.
Ahmed Bilal’s designs struck an almost unattainable balance between two contradictory states, whimsicality and boldness for the woman who stood apart from the crowd, high on her femininity and confident in her attitude. 
They catered to the modern woman on the move, comfortable to wear yet exquisitely put together.

Tasawwur is the latest label to have emerged on the horizon of classic aesthetics and beautifully crafted dazzling creations. Founded by two fashion forces, Khadija Ahmed and Masooma Amir, the brand was born with the express purpose of catering to each individual’s imagination.
Classical dancer Khanzada Asfandyar Khattak took to the stage and demonstrated his fusion of Pashto Khattak dance with the Indian classical Kathak and created Khattak Kathak. Ustad Dildar Hussain and Abrar Hussain Qawwal also performed at the ceremony.

14,PML-N Pindi gears up for power show on March 27,"Workers asked to accord warm welcome to rally led by Maryam, Hamza.","RAWALPINDI: Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) workers and supporters have rolled up their sleeves for a big political show in Islamabad on March 27 as the local chapter of the party has asked its workers to accord a warm welcome to the rally that will be led by Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz from Lahore.
The PML-N Rawalpindi chapter also warned Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed that its workers would make his entry into Rawalpindi difficult.
In a meeting of party workers on Sunday, PML-N Metropolitan President and former mayor Sardar Naseem said Sheikh Rashid Ahmed was the biggest ‘lota’ (turncoat) who had ditched PML-N when Gen Pervez Musharraf came into power.

Workers asked to accord warm welcome to rally led by Maryam, Hamza

“Once the workers decide to ban your entry, you (Sheikh Rashid) will not be able to enter Lal Haveli,” Mr Naseem said.
He said his party had told workers and supporters to get ready for the power show in Islamabad on March 27 and protect the parliamentarians from PTI’s goons.
The meeting decided that women workers would provide protection to the party’s women lawmakers and youth wing to the party’s leadership on March 27.
It also asked the party’s supporters to bring at least 200 people from each union council.
All union council chairmen will lead their separate rallies and join the main rally led by Hanif Abbasi and Sardar Naseem in the city and Malik Abrar and Daniyal Chaudhry in the cantonment areas.
Talking to Dawn, Mayor Sardar Naseem said his party’s workers would welcome the rally led by Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz and join them on their way to Islamabad.
“All party workers and supporters will go to Islamabad in the shape of rallies led by former MNA Hanif Abbasi, former MPAs Raja Hanif, Ziaullah Shah and others. Women wing, youth wing, student federation and minority and labour wings will bring their separate rallies,” Mr Naseem said.
He said the PML-N had finalised the plan to counter arrest and if the interior ministry tried to sabotage their peaceful rally, party workers from every street and area of the garrison city would foil its attempt.
“Rawalpindi is the fort of the PML-N which can be seen from the results of the local government elections in the cantonment areas from where not a single PTI member got elected,” he added.
He said in the last three years, the PTI government had done nothing for the residents of Rawalpindi and now Imran Khan had threatened to bring people to Islamabad.
“In Rawalpindi, many PTI local leaders are contacting PML-N as they want to join the party,” he claimed.

19,Over 50pc independent female candidates contesting local govt polls in KP,ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the...,"ISLAMABAD: The independent women contestants outnumbered the combined tally of women candidates fielded by the political parties for the Neighborhood and Village Councils in the second phase of local government elections being held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on March 31.
Overall, the independent female candidates constitute 51pc as against 27pc and 22pc women fielded by liberal and religious parties respectively.
This was revealed by Pattan, an NGO that works for democracy, human rights and gender equality in a report released here on Sunday.
It said reserved seats remained vacant or being won without any contest, a phenomenon that had also been seen in the first phase of the polls.
According to Pattan, lack of political will appears to be mainly responsible for low rate of female participation in local elections.
The second phase of local election shows that on an average only 1.76 female candidates are in the field against one seat, while seat to candidate ratio on other categories of seats is much high. For instance, on average there are 10 candidates against one seat for chairmen/mayor category.
Pattan argues that prior conditions (female literacy rate, human development level, women’s participation in labour force and access to public life, etc.,) appear to have played a major role in determining the level of women’s participation in the election.
Because of the existing differentiation, women’s participation as candidates varies from district to district. For instance, in Lower and Upper Kohistan – extremely poor and underdeveloped districts --about 90pc women seats remained vacant. 
In Battagram, out of total 90 female seats as many as 71 or 79pc remained vacant.
In South Waziristan too, more than 68pc of female seats remained vacant, while in Abbottabad, only 32 or 15pc of the 209 seats are vacant. 
In Upper Chitral, female candidates did not leave a single seat vacant.
However, there appears significant variations across districts. 
For instance, share of religious parties is higher than liberal parties in six districts - Mansehra 16pc, North Waziristan 36pc and Kurram 36pc, and Orakzai 32%. The liberal parties have clear edge over religious parties in eight districts - Upper Chitral 33pc, Lower Dir 49pc, Malakand 44pc, Shangla 43pc, Swat 50pc and Upper Dir 57pc. 
In 11 districts the independent candidates constitute clear majority in comparison to combined strength of all parties. 
In Abbottabad 88pc, Battagram 94pc, Upper Chitral 56pc, Lower Chitral 64pc, Mansehra 84pc, North Waziristan 53pc, South Waziristan 81pc, Orakzai 56pc, and Shangla 50pc.
Analysis of the contestation data (ECP Form X List of Contesting Candidates) also reveals some interesting socio-political trends:
1) High participation of female candidates even in the conservative or traditional districts than the combined female candidates of political parties is a clear sign of emergence of new social forces that are ready to play an important role in local governance.
2) Political parties appear to be ignorant of their emergence and have little appetite to broaden and deepen democracy and to avail this opportunity.
3) Political parties seem to be more interested in top positions i.e. mayors and chairpersons than in the quota seats of the marginalised sections of the society.
4) As a large number of women seats will remain vacant even after by-election female populations of many Neighborhood and Village Councils of KPK are likely to be deprived of women representatives.
Pattan’s analysis is primarily based on the ECP’s Form X (list of contesting candidates) of 17 districts.
The Pattan in it’s recommendations said the ECP should make available data and forms of every election promptly.
It said political parties need to invest resources to set up party chapters at grassroots level and must also hold internal party election and ECP should monitor their polling processes.
It also said civil society, women groups and trade unions should plan to field candidates against quota seats.
