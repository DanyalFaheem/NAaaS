1,Tourism to be given industry status: SAPM,FAISALABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Tourism Azam Jamil said on Sunday that tourism would ...,"FAISALABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Tourism Azam Jamil said on Sunday that tourism would be given the status of an industry, which would be managed by the private sector and the government would play the role of a facilitator and regulator.
Addressing a dinner reception given by the Pakistan Economic Conference (PEC) in collaboration with the Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FCCI), he said the government has finally decided to devolve the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) to provinces. He said all PTDC hotels, motels and other assets would be transferred to provinces under the condition that they would hand over the same to the private sector within a period of two months.
He said the government was not meant to run businesses but play the role of facilitator. He said 33 to 35 motels were lying closed for the last 10 years, as the job had been entrusted to irrelevant persons. He said the PTDC would be restructured. A national-level e-portal on tourism was ready, which would be launched by Prime Minister Imran Khan soon.
He said that a one-stop website had been developed which would have all related information about tourism sites and their managements. The government has identified the potential tourist attractions in which local and national investors could provide required facilities, he added.
He said a concept of village tourism had been introduced, which would also play a major role in promoting the country’s cultural diversity. It was a World Bank-funded project, which would attract foreign tourists to visit scenic valleys of northern areas. Similarly, a ski resort would also be developed in Chitral, which would be a unique attraction for domestic and foreign tourists, he added.
Stressing the importance of a road communication system, he said that it was very strange that a 300km stretch of Silk Road had no bathroom, which was basic and fundamental requirement of any tourist. The government is working for standardising hotels in addition to other allied services, he added.
He said qualified professionals were required to manage the hospitality industry and in this connection, schools were being established in different parts of the country.
Mr Jamil also gave a comprehensive presentation about the potential of tourism in Pakistan with steps being taken by the government to engage the private sector.
Provincial Minister for Culture and Industries Khayal Ahmad Kastro also spoke on the occasion and said that for the first time in the history of the province, the Punjab Culture Day was observed on March 14.
He said being the minister for colonies, he retrieved 200,000 acres of state land, encroached upon by land-grabbers. The value of the land was around Rs450 billion, he added.
He paid tribute to PM Khan for organising a foreign ministers’ conference of Islamic countries and said that his strategy played a pivotal role in the revival of the industrial sector in Pakistan.
Deputy Commissioner of Faisalabad Ali Shehzad also spoke on the occasion, while former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Mian Mohammad Idrees and FCCI President Atif Munir Sheikh along with PEC organiser Azhar Chaudhry presented FCCI shields to Mr Jamil.
Wearing their cultural dresses, members of the business community along with their families from across the country participated in the dinner.
A traditional chador was presented to FCCI President Sheikh.

2,Literary notes: Some incorrectly attributed Urdu & Persian literary works,"THE word ‘pseudo’ means not genuine, false. And ‘epigraph’ means an inscription. Therefore, falsely...","THE word ‘pseudo’ means not genuine, false. And ‘epigraph’ means an inscription. Therefore, falsely attributed texts are sometimes referred to as ‘pseudepigraphs’ in literary criticism. 
A misattributed or ‘pseudegraphic’ text is the work whose generally known author is not the real author and it turns out to have actually been written by someone else. Incorrectly attributed literary works are not always result of literary forgeries and sometimes misattribution is unintentional, though plagiarists and cheats do involve in such malpractices. 
Richard D. Altick (1915-2008) is considered a world authority on research methodology. On misattribution he says that we have “to identify the author of anonymous or pseudonymous works (or works attributed to the wrong writer); to decide which parts of a work written by two or more authors belong to whom; and to remove from the received list of a writer’s works whatever pieces are not his, thereby purifying his canon (the roster of his authentic writings)”. 
In our literary history, we come across works that have been attributed to authors who did not pen them. Such studies are known, in Urdu, as ‘tehqeeq-i-mansoobaat’, or research on misattributions. Some of our scholars have busted many myths. Revisiting these facts would be of interest: 
General perception about Qissa Chahar Durvesh was that it was originally written in Persian by Ameer Khusrau, but Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that it was written in Mughal era, some 300 years later than Khusrau’s era, though various Urdu versions are based on Persian texts. 
M’eraaj-ul-Aashiqeen, a work on Sufism, was edited by Moulvi Abdul Haq and he said it was penned by Hazrat Syed Muhammad Husaini Banda Nawaz Gesu Daraaz. Dr Husaini Shahid and, later on, Dr Hafeez Qateel, proved that it was not written by Hazrat Gesu Daraaz but a shorter version of Tilavat-ul-Vujood, a work by Makhdoom Shah Husaini. 
It was commonly believed that Firdousi had composed a hajv (lampoon) to vent his resentment against Mahmood Ghaznavi, but Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that some of the couplets included in the so-called hajv were composed by some other poets and a few others were taken out of contest from Firdousi’s Shah nama and joined together with some fake verses. He also proved that the number of couplets in Mahmood’s hajv kept on increasing in numbers with the passage of time. 
A booklet named Risala-i-Kashf-ul-Asraar is attributed to Hazrat Ali Bin Usman Hajveri, popularly known as Data Ganj Bakhsh. Hakeem Muhammad Moosa Amritsari proved that the attribution is false, and perhaps intentional, as it is written in ‘Sabk-i-Hindi’, or Indian style of Persian, and Hazrat Data Sahib’s Kashf-ul-Mahjoob is in a prose style belonging to Samanid or Samanian era. 
Naval Kishor, the famous publisher from Lucknow, had published several editions of Divan-i-Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Ajmeri. Hafiz Mahmood Sherani proved that no critic had mentioned Khwaja Ajmeri’s poetry until 500 years after his death and the attribution is incorrect. Sherani wrote that it might have been penned by Maulana Moinuddin Bin Sharafuddin. 
Dr Ghulam Mustafa Khan wrote that a Persian divan published by Naval Kishor (5th edition, 1883) is wrongly attributed to Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jeelani. He has cited certain evidences that prove his point of view and establish the fact that the divan is not authored by Hazrat Abdul Qadir Jeelani. 
Dr Nazeer Ahmed has written that there are some quatrains in the divan of Hafiz Sherazi that were not written by Hafiz as these quatrains are included in Nuzhat-ul-Majalis. We know that Nuzhat-ul-Majalis, an anthology of quatrains, was compiled in 13th century AD and Hafiz was born in 14th century AD. 
Mazhar-ul-A’jaaib, is attributed to Fareeduddin Attar, but Khaliq Anjum wrote that it was written by someone else and attributed to Attar with religious motives. 
Khaliq Anjum wrote that most of the books attributed to the Sufis of Chishtiya order are either fake or misattributed. 
Qazi Abdul Wadood proved that Gulistan-i-Sukhan was written by Imam Bakhsh Sebhai and its attribution to Mirza Qadir Bakhsh Sabir is incorrect. 
Some manuscripts of Mirza Sauda’s kulliyaat (collected works) have verses that were not composed by Sauda, wrote Khaliq Anjum and Rasheed Hasan Khan. Such interpolations are not uncommon in classical Urdu poetry manuscripts. 
Hafiz Mahmood Sherani wrote that Khaliq Bari was not written by Ameer Khusrau and its original author was someone else also named Khusrau. 
It is a known fact that Mirza Ghalib wrote the book Lataaif-i-Ghaibi to defend himself but put his friend Miandad Khan Sayyah’s name on its title as author. 
It is a misconception that Divan-i-Makhfi was written by Zaibunnisa Makhfi, daughter of Aurangzeb Alamgir. 
Facts about suspected or incorrect attributions presented in this piece have been collected from different sources, especially an issue of Tehqeeq, a research journal edited by Dr Najm-ul-Islam. Some are from Khaliq Anjum’s book Matni Tanqeed.

3,"8,000 police officials to ensure security during cricket matches in Lahore","Australian players and officials have been given the status of state guests, according to the government directions.","LAHORE: Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Additional IG Fayyaz Ahmad Dev has said police will ensure foolproof security during the Pakistan-Australia cricket series like they have been doing in the past.
“We are ready to provide complete protection to the visiting national and international players, as well as spectators, during the series,” he said, adding the security plan was more elaborate than that of previous matches.  
Pakistan and Australia will play one test match, three one-day international matches and one T-20 match in Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium from March 21 to April 5.
According to the security plan, more than 8,000 police officials, including SPs, SDPOs, SHOs from Dolphin Squad, Police Response Unit and Elite Force, will perform security, patrolling and traffic management duties during the matches.
Australian players and officials have been given the status of state guests, according to the government directions.  
The CCPO said close circuit TV cameras around the stadium and parking areas had been made fully operational to ensure strict vigilance during the cricket series.  
He said efforts would be made to ensure that the routine activities of the people, especially of traders and businessmen, were least disturbed during the matches.  
He said ‘zero route’ would be provided to the teams to ensure their security by containing traffic only during their movement from the residential places to the stadium and vice versa.  
He said four-layer security would be ensured at the stadium and spectators would only be allowed to enter after a thorough checking process. The Covid-19 protocols would also be followed, he added.  
Dev said round-the-clock monitoring of the residential places of teams, routes, matches and movement of players had been ensured through CCTV cameras, while snipers would be deployed on the rooftops of buildings during the matches.  
He said search and sweep operations were also being conducted on a daily basis in the city, particularly around the stadium and in designated areas.  
The CCPO directed the officers concerned to coordinate with related departments, including the Punjab Safe Cities Authority, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), district administration and law enforcement agencies to successfully implement the security plan.

5,Educationists see no logic in KP govt’s decision to begin session in August,"Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February...","PESHAWAR: Educationists and administrative officers in the Elementary and Secondary Education Department see no logic in starting the next academic year from August, as teachers have already completed teaching their courses at the government primary and high schools by the end of February. 
The academic year in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa usually starts in April and ends in March. The school administration conducts annual home exams up to grade-8 in March and results are declared on March 31 each academic year. 
However, in the light of the federal government’s decision, the E&SE Department has decided to start the upcoming academic year from August instead of April, saying the students’ time had been wasted when schools were closed due to Covid-19 pandemic at the start of the ongoing academic year. 
“Due to delay caused by the Covid-19 situation, the academic year 2022-23 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shall commence from August 1, 2022, and conclude on April 30, 2023, and the academic year 2023-24 shall commence from May 1, 2023,” reads a notification issued by the education department in the start of March. 

Teachers fear wastage of time, say they had completed courses in February

A principal of a government high school told Dawn that in the ongoing academic year, classes started in July which continued non-stop for nine months. However, he said that the school administration could not take examinations from the students due to ‘illogical’ decision of the government. 
A science teacher in a government school told Dawn that he had completed teaching his courses at the end of January. “I have completed courses of three subjects, including chemistry and Physics for class-10, and general science for grade-8,” he said. 
As per the school principal’s directives, he said, the teachers had now engaged their students in different activities like revision of their courses, weekly tests, etc. 
Several principals of the government schools said the E&SE Department had not communicated to the schools in writing about annual home examinations. 
However, a district education officer said that a senior officer of education department had recently verbally communicated to the district education officers to issue directives to the government schools to conduct examinations by the end of May. 
In plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the summer vacation usually starts in government schools in June. 
“The teachers usually send their students for summer vacation with proper homework of the subjects taught in April and May, to be revised during the vacation,” a teacher said. 
However, he said, if they started the summer vacation at the start of June in the instant case, they would not be able to give homework to the students because they would not have started their next classes and thus the students would waste three months of summer vacation. 
School Officers Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, president Samiullah Khalil told Dawn that the association also had reservations about the start of academic year from August as it would waste precious time of the students. 
He said that the office-bearers of the teachers association raised this issue with the recently-posted secretary education in a meeting and demanded to revisit the decision of starting the academic year from August. 
He said it was clear in the education department’s notification that the next academic year would start from August, but it had not given any direction when the ongoing academic year would be ended. 
He said the association had also demanded of the government to hold annual home examinations in April. However, he said, the association could take its own decision of holding examinations in April in the larger interest of students.

7,Pakistan signs deal to avoid $11bn penalty in Reko Diq case,PM Imran congratulates the nation on the agreement for the development of the Reko Diq mine.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Sunday claimed to have saved the country from $11 billion penalty in Reko Diq case and reconstituted a project aimed at excavating huge gold and copper reserves from the site in Balochistan. 
The federal and Balochistan governments and two international firms — Antofagasta PLC and Barrick Gold Corporation — have reached an agreement in principle on a framework to reconstitute the Reko Diq project, and a pathway for Antofagasta to exit the project. 
Prime Minister Imran Khan witnessed the signing ceremony. Speaking on the occasion, he expressed the hope that the investment would mark the beginning of large-scale investments in Balochistan that would change the quality of life of ordinary citizens in the province. 
Later, in a series of tweets, PM Khan congratulated the nation, specially the people of Balochistan, on the agreement for development of Reko Diq mine. 
“I congratulate the nation & ppl of Balochistan on successful agreement with Barrick Gold for development of Reko Diq mine after 10 years of legal battles & negotiations. Penalty of approx [approximately] $11bn is off set, $10bn will be invested in Balochistan creating 8,000 new jobs,” the prime minister tweeted. “RD [Reko Diq] will potentially be the largest gold & copper mine in the world. It will liberate us from crippling debt & usher in a new era of development & prosperity,” he wrote. 

 





 
Meanwhile, the Balochistan cabinet in a special session approved the agreement, terming it a game changer for the province. 
Later, addressing a press conference along with Energy Minister Hammad Azhar and Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, Minister for Finance Shaukat Tarin said that after the signing of the agreement Pakistan would not only avoid the $11bn penalty but also get an opportunity to explore the world’s largest gold and copper reserve. 
He said some $10bn would be invested under the Reko Diq project which would create 8,000 new jobs for the locals. The minister said that as per the new agreement, Barrick Gold Corporation would get 50 per cent and the Balochistan government 25pc share, while the rest 25pc would be shared among the state-owned enterprises — Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Pakistan (GHPL). 
Mr Tarin recalled that the federal and Balochistan governments had in 2006 signed an agreement with Canadian company Barrick Gold and Chilean firm Antofagasta to extract gold and copper from Reko Diq mine. According to the deal, 37.5pc share each was given to the two foreign companies and 25pc to the Balochistan government. 
He said that agreement was suspended in 2011 due to a dispute over the legality of its licensing process. As a result, the Interna­tional Court of Arbitration levelled $6.4bn award on the government of Pakistan while at the same time the London Court of Arbitration was also imposing another $4bn fine on Pakistan. 
He said that soon after taking over the charge, PM Khan aggressively pursued the case. As a result, an agreement was signed on Sunday under which Antofagasta decided not to participate in the reconstituted project and withdrew from its claim of $3.9bn in place of $900 million, which would be paid by the three state-owned enterprises in return for a 25pc share. 
The minister said Pakistan, particularly Balochistan, would be benefited for over 100 years from this project and the total worth is estimated to be over $100bn. 
Terming the deal a landmark achievement, Energy Minister Hammad Azhar said it was a historic day as it had not only avoided $11bn worth of penalty but also created a new opportunity for the country. He said the “landmark success” had also saved the country from blacklisted by the FATF by implementing 32 of the 35 conditions.  
Meanwhile, President of Barrick Gold Mark Bristow had a meeting with Balochistan Chief Minister Qudoos Bizenjo after the signing of the agreement.

9,Dissidents to face social boycott: PM Imran,PM blames several media houses for siding with dacoits and taking money from foreign powers to topple govt.,"MALAKAND: Prime Minister Imran Khan has claimed that he has been advised by party colleagues to bring the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf dissidents back into the party fold by offering the same bribe as proffered by the opposition, but he rejected the advice telling them that he would rather prefer to lose his government than taking the path of horse-trading.
Addressing a public meeting in the Dargai area of Malakand on Sunday, Prime Minister Khan also criticised several media houses for ‘siding with the dacoits’ and blamed them for ‘selling out to foreign powers’. 
PM Khan, in his speech, also recounted all the achievements of his government, including record tax collection, exports and remittances, during the past three and a half months.
He alleged that the dacoits were using public money to buy PTI lawmakers but told the opposition that it was going to lose “this match”. He also vowed that he would never opt for horse-trading with public money, as the opposition did. However, he promised that like a father he would forgive the disgruntled PTI lawmakers, who had been ‘deceived’ by opposition parties to vote for no-trust motion against him, if they repented and returned to the party fold. At the same time, Mr Khan warned other dissatisfied PTI leaders, “Return to the party fold or face social boycott.” He urged the turncoats to think of their children and families, saying that they would lose respect and honour in society. “People will neither trust nor respect you. Masses are aware of whatever is happening in the country. This is the age of social media where it’s difficult to hide anything from them,” he asserted, adding that Changa Manga-like politics was not possible in the digital age.

Imran blames several media houses for siding with dacoits and taking money from foreign powers to topple govt

Talking about the mainstream media, PM Khan said the media had a major role in any democracy. “It is media duty to create awareness. To stand with the good, the biggest responsibility lies with the media. It must raise voice against evil. But I have to say it that unfortunately many media houses are getting money, several of them are receiving money from abroad. 
“And I leave it to the Pakistani nation that when you see the [section of] media you will find them standing with the dacoits who are destroying democracy. 
“If any foreign power wants to topple the government, how easy it is: just buy the loyalty of 20 hypocrites and the government will fall,” the prime minister said.
PM Khan also warned the media standing with the ‘dacoits’ [opposition], they should understand “the nation is watching you.” At this moment when the nation was on the two extremes, people were also watching which section of the media was standing with the country and its people and which one was standing with the dacoits, he asserted. 
Criticising Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and other opposition party leaders, Mr Kahn said people could identify the ‘three stooges’ from the opposition who had been facing corruption cases for looting the country for years. He sounded confident the opposition would badly lose the match. He told the public meeting that a decisive moment had arrived in the history of Pakistan. He alleged that the corrupt mafia was offering bribes to the ruling party lawmakers to buy their loyalties with their ill-gotten money.
The judiciary, election commission and the nation were observing the situation, Mr Khan said. 
In the UK, he said, the members of parliament never sold their loyalties because they had strong democratic values and political insight. “They can never imagine such cheap tactics in politics,” he added.
The prime minister alleged that bags filled with stacks of money were being given to his party lawmakers at Sindh House, terming the action ‘funeral of democracy’. He appealed to the nation it was “your obligation to stand up and raise your voice against such tactics on part of the opposition parties”.
‘Foreign policy to favour people’
In his speech, PM Khan also lauded India for having an ‘independent’ foreign policy that was favourable to own people. He said he never bowed down before anyone and would not let the nation bow down. He said his foreign policy would also favour the people of Pakistan.
He maintained that he had said no to the European Union envoys who sought Pakistan support against Russia in the Ukraine conflict, because they broke protocol by making the joint statement public. Pakistan would have gained nothing by complying with the EU’s request, he said, adding that Pakistan being an independent country would not become part of any bloc.
He said Pakistan could not make progress if it remained slave to the world superpowers. He said the nation would not prosper until it stood on its own feet. Only hypocrites would never stand by the people, because they ‘worship money’, he remarked.

10,"Detained in India, Pakistan’s Sumaira to return next week","Her husband, an Indian national, took her there without a visa via the Nepal border.","ISLAMABAD: Sumaira Rehman, a Pakistani woman languishing in a prison in Bangalore, India, is set to return to her home country next week along with her four-year-old daughter Sana Fatima.
“Indian authorities have completed all formalities for the release of the Pakistani woman. She is expected to arrive in Pakistan next week with her four-year-old daughter Sana Fatima,” PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui told Dawn by phone from Dubai.
Meanwhile, Suhana Biswa Patna, an Indian woman lawyer working for the release from the Bangalore prison and her repatriation to Pakistan, has thanked Senator Siddiqui for raising the issue of Ms Sumaira’s release and her repatriation to Pakistan.
“Allow me to thank you for raising the matter in the Senate. We would not have seen this day without your help,” Ms Patna, a leading Indian lawyer fighting for human rights, especially for jailed women, told Mr Siddiqui by phone.

Her husband, an Indian national, took her there without a visa via Nepal border

“Thank you sir for all your help. Both Sumaira and I are very grateful,” Ms Patna said in a message. Senator Siddiqui also appreciated Ms Patna’s efforts and thanked her.
Senator Siddiqui said that he was in touch with the Indian lawyer, Pakistan Foreign Office and Asma Jahangir Legal Aid Cell and was getting information on a daily basis.
He said that after the issuance of an NoC from the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs has also completed all formalities and it was working with Pakistani authorities to finalise arrangements for Ms Sumaira’s return to the country. It is likely that she, along with her daughter, would return home next week.
He said the state had to play an important role with regard to Ms Sumaira and her daughter, adding that after the Pakistani woman’s return to the country he would table a formal resolution in the Senate on the negligence and dereliction of duty by Pakistani officials concerned.
Ms Sumaira married an Indian national Mohammad Shihab of Palakkad, Kerala, whom she had met in Qatar.
Shihab took her to India without a visa in September 2016 via Nepal border. She was arrested in May 2017 and was subsequently sentenced to three years in prison.
Two months later, she gave birth to a baby girl. Her husband left her when she was in custody. Since her release from prison, Ms Sumaira has been living at a detention centre in Banga­lore with her daughter.
Pakistan had finally issued a citizenship certificate to Sumaira on February 17, paving the way for her return to Pakistan with her daughter.
The same day the certificate was communicated to Pakistan’s High Commission in New Delhi through the Foreign Office to instantly reach relevant authorities.
The certificate was issued after Senator Siddiqui raised the issue in the House twice in a week.

11,Trilateral talks on trans-Afghan rail project due next week,BoI chairman will interact with potential investors from many countries for B2B meetings in Tashkent.,"

STATE Minister and BoI chairman Azfar Ahsan.

 
ISLAMABAD: Senior officials of Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan will meet in Tashkent next week for a trilateral meeting to discuss a potential railway project aimed at laying a railway track linking Termez, Mazar-i-Sharif, Kabul and Peshawar to promote trade in the region.
Minister of State and chairman of the Board of Investment (BoI) Azfar Ahsan has left Islamabad for Tashkent to participate in the trilateral meeting.
In addition to the trilateral meeting, Mr Ahsan will also participate in the Tashkent Inter­national Investment Forum which will be held from March 24 to 26.
The Uzbekistan president is taking special interest in the laying of the railway track with Pakistan via Afghanistan for its future trade and business activities. Uzbekistan, being a landlocked country, has been dependent on Iran’s trade routes for its imports and exports and the sanctions on Iran have made it difficult for Uzbekistan to continue using the same route.

BoI chairman will interact with potential investors from many countries for B2B meetings in Tashkent

The proposed railway connectivity has also been discussed at various international forums, including the Shanghai Coope­ration Organisation (SCO).
During his visit to Pakistan early this month, Uzbek Presi­dent Shavkat Mirziyoyev reaffirmed the important role of the railway project linking the three countries for the future of the region.
Pakistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to evolve a joint ‘roadmap’ which includes measures to develop a feasibility study for the project and start construction work on both sides.
The Trans-Afghan Railway project is stated to be the most economical and shortest route connecting Central Asia to Pakistan’s ports of Karachi, Gwadar and Port Qasim.
The two countries have already signed the bilateral Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) and the enforcement of the Transit Trade Agreement. These agreements are the sign of the beginning of a new era in bilateral trade relations and will serve to increase mutual trade by utilising existing opportunities.
The Tashkent International Inves­tment Forum is being convened under the theme of “Realising New Growth Agenda” and expects to bring over 200 leaders from the government, busi­ness, civil society and academia to discuss and shape regio­nal as well as industry agendas.
The BoI chairman, who will be the keynote speaker at the inaugural session of the forum, will also meet Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on the sidelines of the forum and will interact with potential investors from many countries as head of delegation from Pakistan for business-to-business (B2B) meetings.
An official of BoI says the visit of Mr Ahsan is being of paramount importance for Pakistan on diplomatic and economic front as it comes at a time when strategic ties between Uzbekistan and Pakistan are moving in an upward trajectory. 
The BoI chairman envisages that the visit will culminate into fruitful economic cooperation between the three countries and will further strengthen diplomatic and strategic ties.
The forum aims to explore areas of trilateral cooperation among Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan and revolves around discussing the investment potential of Central Asia, transformations in trade flows in Central Asia, digitalisation of transport systems, attracting investments in tourism sector, production modernisation and new agricultural markets.
Mr Ahsan, during his visit, will also hold a meeting with Uzbek Minister of Transport I. Makhkamov and the head of the Afghan delegation in Termez. The discussions will centre on the available conditions of cargo transportation in Pakistan and proposals for increasing the volume of traffic between the three countries will be discussed from Pakistan’s perspective.

The newly appointed special prosecutor, Imtiaz  Siddiqui, is a senior lawyer based in Lahore and has vast experience in  handling corporate, banking and tax-related matters.
Sources said  Advocate Siddiqui would appear before a two-member Islamabad High Court  (IHC) bench, comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, on Monday (today) and would lead the prosecution.
He  has been appointed in less than a month after NAB had brought a private lawyer, Mohammad Azhar Siddique, as its lead prosecutor for Ms Sharif’s  case.
Mr Siddique had put a single appearance before the IHC bench  last month and sought a month-long adjournment to prepare arguments. The hearing was then adjourned until March 21 (today). 
He had replaced Barrister Usman Cheema, also a private lawyer who had been appointed by NAB as its special prosecutor.
Prosecutor  Cheema skipped a couple of hearings and then sought another adjournment  for being Covid-19 positive. However, after recovery he recused himself  from the case. 
Earlier in September, NAB started pursuing  the appeal vigorously and even filed an application seeking day-to-day  hearings. But the bureau started seeking frequent adjournments  after the IHC bench raised questions on the admissibility of the  evidence produced before the trial court against Ms Sharif.

13,"NP rejects Reko Diq deal, terms it ‘anti-people’",QUETTA: The central cabinet of  the National Party on Sunday rejected the Reko Diq copper-cum-gold project agreement...,"QUETTA: The central cabinet of  the National Party on Sunday rejected the Reko Diq copper-cum-gold project agreement signed by representatives of the federal and Balochistan governments with Barrick Gold Corporation of Canada, and termed the agreement ‘anti-people’.
Presided over by party’s President Dr Malik Baloch, the NP’s central cabinet reviewed the agreement in detail and observed that foreign control over natural resources of the people of Balochistan was not acceptable for the party.
The participants of the meeting were of the opinion that the new agreement was a fraud with the people of Balochistan in the name of development. The meeting pledged not to allow the Balochistan government to sell out natural resources of the province at throwaway prices.
“The people of Balochistan and the National Party reject the Reko Diq Copper-Cum-Gold Project agreement outright,” said a statement issued by the party after its Central Cabinet meeting late Sunday night. 
It said the Balochistan government had ratified the agreement at its meeting of the provincial cabinet in which a majority of the cabinet members were not present, which proved the dishonesty of the provincial government in approving the agreement.
Besides, it said, the federal government had also lost its mandate after the tabling of a no-confidence motion against the prime minister in the National Assembly.
It said that the terms and conditions of the Reko Diq agreement had not been mentioned and they had been kept secret and, therefore, such an accord was not acceptable to the NP and the people of Balochistan as they were not aware of the details of the agreement. The party said the agreement was also unacceptable because it had been signed at a time when the country was witnessing political turmoil.
