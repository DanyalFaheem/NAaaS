For the first time, service ducts would be constructed on the road side to avoid further digging, he said, adding that roads selected for repair and reconstruction were the ones that had been damaged in the last four years as well as the recent spell of rain. He said after this, roads of the city and cantonment would be improved to beautify the city.
Footpaths and green areas would also be developed along roads. He said that roads in the city area would be constructed through development funds of Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC) while 40 roads would be repaired through funds provided by the provincial government.
RMC had sought expression of interest from reputed companies for reconstruction work, he said, adding the contract to carry out this work has been given to a firm that has its own machinery.
Apart from this, he said that work to improve parking space in city areas has also been launched. The traffic police helped the administration in identifying problematic areas in the city.

1,Sealing of swings in park on public holiday criticised,"TAXILA: The district administration of Attock sealed poorly maintained rides, slides and swings, including...","TAXILA: The district administration of Attock sealed poorly maintained rides, slides and swings, including mechanical, conventional and electrical, at an amusement park located on a private land in the Pindigheb city to avert any untoward incident.
However, the action drew criticism from the visitors and picnickers who termed it a “wrong decision at a wrong time”, depriving people of a cheap entertainment.
Sources said a team from the local administration, led by assistant commissioner (AC) Ejaz Abdul Kareem, visited the park on the directives of Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Zulqurnian to check safety measures and inspect documents for the regularisation of the mechanical swings.
The visit was part of a drive for checking safety measures and for verifying the no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the district administration for such swings in amusement parks.
However, the team found no prior approval taken from the district administration for the swings. Subsequently, these were sealed. According to officials, these swings were not only being operated without a fitness certificate but also many of them were installed without approval from the concerned departments.
The park administration has been asked to provide documents under Rule 4(2) of the Regulation of Mechanical Rides Bylaws 2017, said the AC while talking to newsmen.
He said details of the rides, including the structure, mechanics, electricity supply, control, safety, hydraulic and pneumatic system were to be submitted to the district administration.
“The district administration will ensure that the ban is implemented and in this regard it has sought help from the police,” the official said.
However, the visitors to park criticised the decision of the local administration.
Zahida Batool, a resident of Shahbazpur, said she brought her children to the park to celebrate the independence day. She said that if there were fitness or renewal of licence issues, why the administration was waiting for holidays.
Naqqi Shah, a visitor from Rangl with his four children, said the administration should have fixed the problem before the holidays as their poor management deprived hundreds of holidaymakers especially children of an entertainment.
Ayesha Bibi, 15, told this reporter that every year she along with her family came to the park from her village near Ikhlas but this time she was disappointed when she saw all the swings closed.

5,FWO asked not to give direct access to illegal societies from Margalla Road,Contractor told to build road as per CDA's approved drawing.,"ISLAMABAD: The engineering wing of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has directed the Frontier Work Organisation (FWO) to ensure construction of Margalla Road near D-12 as per the approved drawing issued by the civic agency to avoid any access to unauthorised housing societies.
Through a letter dated August 12, the engineering wing asked the FWO, the contractor, to construct the road along D-12/3 as per the original drawing and design. The letter said any access or crossing structure to illegal housing societies is not allowed as per available project drawing of the CDA.
“The actual road profile at the reach be followed strictly and any modification carried out should be restored to actual position/profile as per the issued design without further delay,” read the letter.
Sources said after knowing that operators of some illegal housing societies were trying to get direct access from Margalla Road, the engineering wing as a precautionary measure informed the contractor not to listen to anyone and construct the road as per the original plan.
The north of D-12/3, where some people want to get direct access, falls in the limits of Zone III where housing societies and new houses are prohibited as per the zoning regulations 1992.
According to CDA’s website, there are seven illegal housing societies in Zone III - Al Rayan Society, Ali Town, Arcadia City, Green Hills, Green Meadows North Ridge and Major Makhdoom Society.
The sources said two of them fall in the said area - north of D-12 - whose operators wanted to get access from Margalla Road. 
These two societies are using direct access from CDA’s land near D-12 and on several occasions the civic agency took action and blocked the unmetalled road, which was later reopened.
The planning wing has already turned down a request for providing direct access to the societies whereas the road directorate is also pleading that the highway should be constructed as per the original approved plan. However, sources said two CDA officers wanted a “soft” approach to giving direct access to the societies through an underpass.
“We are supposed to provide direct access to old villages that fall along the road such as Shah Allah Ditta, which is centuries-old while the area north of D-12 falls in Zone III where housing societies could not operate. Therefore, we cannot provide them access for their commercial ventures,” said an official of the CDA.
Meanwhile, the construction of Margalla Road from G.T. Road to D-12 is in progress and so far almost 80pc of work, including carpeting, has been carried out.
The sources said the remaining work would be completed in a few months.
In June this year, after making a revision in the scope of work, the CDA extended the contract for six months.
CDA officials said work was going on in full swing and was likely to be completed before December. They said the issue of a graveyard that falls in the alignment of the road near Shah Allah Ditta had also been decided. The road will now be tilted towards the north side to avoid the graveyard.
When contacted, CDA’s spokesperson Syed Asif Raza said no decision had been made for providing access to unauthorised housing schemes from Margalla Road, he said.

A UAE mission, which is on a visit to Pakistan, aims to conduct feasibility study for establishment of PFF in Pakistan based on World Health Organisation (WHO) standards as the blood services in country are mostly provided by hospitals’ blood banks with no functional separation of the plasma processes into production and utilisation.
WHO Adviser on Blood Safety Dr Hassan Abbas Zaheer, while talking to Dawn, said that it was a significant development as Pakistan does not have even a single PFF despite the fact that there are a few hundred thousand patients suffering from immunodeficiency disorder.
He said that the term to separate blood components was called “Plasma Fractionation” as blood was initially divided into three components called Platelets, Red Blood Cells and White Blood Cells which floated in a fluid called plasma.
Dr Zaheer, who is also former Project Director of Safe Blood Transfusion Project (SBTP), said that a huge industry was required to do “Plasma Fractionation” and if plasma would be separated Pakistan can meet the requirements of the country and can also export it.
Dr Zaheer said that a large number of donors will be required and industry will be required to do Plasma Fractionation at industrial level.

He was speaking at a press conference in Attock along with local leadership and office-bearers of the JI district chapter on Monday. He said it had been proved that the three parties nurtured under the umbrella of the establishment and there was no difference among their policies.
The JI chief demanded that the inquiry report of the Lasbela incident should be made public as the whole nation wanted to know the reason behind the tragedy.
Responding to a question, the JI chief said new elections were the only panacea of problems faced by people. He was of the view that all political parties, including PTI, only made hue and cry and did not want accountability at all as their interests were common.
He also demanded that the election commission should be made independent administratively and financially to ensure free, fare and transparent elections. He said it was beyond comprehension that on the one hand PTI MNAs were resigning from assemblies and on the other Imran Khan was filing nomination papers for by-elections.
He warned the government against taking anti-poor decisions on the pressure of the IMF, saying the incumbent rulers should review the agreements with the international agencies instead of surrendering for dollars.
The government, he said, must abolish the VIP culture, interest-based economy, non-developmental expenditures and take other measures in light of Islamic teachings to promote the economy. He said that the prices of food and basic needs had soared sharply making the items completely out of the reach of the common man.
Fuel, gas and electricity prices have skyrocketed but the rulers are unmoved and in exchange for taking one and a half billion dollars loan from the IMF, the government is threatening to raise the price of electricity by Rs40 per unit.
The government, he added, increased the electricity tariff and was set to raise petrol prices on the pressure of the IMF. “Corruption and bad governance are the main reasons behind the current crises,” he said.
The JI chief said PDM, PPP and the PTI were interested in mutual fights than paying any attention on problems being faced by the masses.
“People want to get rid of old faces. The nation should be given a chance to decide who they support. The nation has tried all the three parties and now they want to run the country on the Islamic system,” he said.
He claimed that for the survival of the country, it was necessary for the people to change the system, adding people of Pakistan must stand for their rights and reject the tested faces.
