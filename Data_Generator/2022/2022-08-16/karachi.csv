KARACHI: Faced with the threat of rising polio cases in the country, the Sindh government on Monday launched a week-long anti-polio campaign to inoculate over 9.9 million children under five.
Till date, Pakistan has reported 14 polio cases and all of them have been reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah formally launched the drive at the National Institute of Child Health (NICH). 
The campaign would continue till Aug 21 in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions and then extended to Shaheed Benazirabad, Mirpurkhas, Sukkur, and Larkana divisions from Aug 22.

No polio case has been detected in Sindh since July 2020, says Murad 

Speaking on the occasion, CM Shah said that oral polio drops would be given to over 9.9m children under 5 during the campaign. 
“In the drive, 33,982 teams along with 9,137 supervisors will be participating across the province,” he said, adding that 3,556 partners staff from different organisations would be deputed for supportive supervision and monitoring.
He said that out of the target of over 9.9m children, more than 2.4m children lived in Karachi. 
Referring to the detection of 14 polio cases in the country this year, the chief minister disclosed that the provincial government had increased vigilance at entry and exit points at inter-provincial borders after emergence of the first case from North Waziristan in April.
He said that no polio case had been reported in Sindh since July 2020 and all the environmental samples from the province were negative.
He termed it a great achievement for his government and the Emergency Operation Centre, Sindh. Mr Shah said that 571,566 children had been vaccinated in the province and of them 13,088 belonging to KP were administered vaccine at the province’s border.
“Children can be protected from childhood crippling diseases like polio through vaccination and we seek every stakeholder’s help to raise awareness for the purpose,” he said.
He said that efforts in the programme had resulted in around 50 per cent reduction in refusals and missed children but “we must bring them down further” especially in Karachi.
He said that Pakistan was one of the two polio-endemic countries in the world along with Afghanistan. “Remember, polio has no cure but can easily be prevented through vaccination and we are sending workers at your doorsteps, and I am sure people will cooperate with them and help save the future of Pakistan and eradicate polio,” he said.
‘Imran Khan is a great entertainer’
Talking to the media, the chief minister said that the people were attending Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan’s rallies because he was a great entertainer and taught them new definitions of science, and geography, religion, and phenology.
“He [Imran] says a train equivalent to the speed of light is being invented...he says Germany and Japan share borders...he says Allah doesn’t allow people to be neutral and he also says Pakistan has 12 seasons,” he said, adding that people had no place to be entertained other than PTI rallies.
He said that musical shows, theatres and movies attracted people in large numbers but it didn’t mean that they would choose an entertainer as their ruler.
Replying to a question, the chief minister said that Rs1 billion for the repair of roads in the city had been approved by the provincial cabinet. “We are trying to arrange Rs10 billion for the reconstruction of roads and drainage systems damaged by heavy rains and for the welfare of the rain-affected people,” he said.
Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, Health Secretary Zulfiqar Shah and others were present on the occasion.

Former MPA Nisar Panhwar and 16 others were arrested for holding an alleged unlawful assembly and provoking people for rioting outside the KPC on the occasion of Independence Day.
On Monday, the investigating officer produced them before the magistrate to seek their physical remand for interrogation.
He submitted that the MQM-Altaf leader, Panhwar, had unlawfully held a large demonstration outside the press club and chanted slogans that provoked the protesters, including women and children, for rioting.
He requested the magistrate to grant their 14-day physical remand in police custody for interrogation and completion of investigation and other legal formalities.
On the other hand, the defence counsel moved applications seeking grant of post-arrest bail to the suspects and their release arguing that they had held a peaceful demonstration, but the police with mala fide intentions arrested them for ulterior motives.
After hearing arguments from both sides, the magistrate granted post-arrest bail to the suspects against a surety of Rs5,000 each.
The magistrate ordered the authorities concerned to release them forthwith if their custody was not required in any other case.
According to the police, the protesters while carrying portraits of MQM founder Hussain raised slogans in his favour and delivered ‘provocative’ speeches. “Since [carrying] picture of Altaf Hussain is banned, the area police took into custody 17 persons and lodged an FIR against them,” the police added.
They were booked in a case under Sections 147 (rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) and 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Artillery Maidan police station.

5,Protest against loadshedding in Shah Faisal Colony causes traffic gridlock,Thousands of people returning home from nearby industrial area remained stuck in the traffic jam for hours .,"KARACHI: Thousands of commuters, including a large number of female factory workers, on Monday remained stuck in one of the worst traffic jams for hours in the eastern parts of the city as residents of Shah Faisal Colony staged a sit-in against prolonged loadshedding and power outages in their vicinity especially during night-time.
While people from almost every part of the city complained of prolonged loadshedding carried out by K-Electric, enraged residents of Shah Faisal Colony took to the streets, blocked main road for vehicular traffic and staged a sit-in. 
Eyewitnesses told Dawn that the charged protestors also beat up policemen near the flyover on the Malir river connecting Shah Faisal Colony with industrial area of Korangi when they tried to remove barricades and obstacles to clear the road.
The protesters said that the KE had made their lives miserable as three-hour loadshedding was being carried out after every three hours in a day.

Thousands of people returning home from nearby industrial area remained stuck in traffic jam for hours 

All types of vehicles, including motorcycles and scooters, remained stationed bumper to bumper for hours from Shah Faisal Colony No 5 to Singer Chowrangi in Korangi piling miseries on people, especially female factory workers who were on way back to their homes from Korangi Industrial Area.
Nasir Mehmood, a resident of Shah Faisal Colony No 5, told Dawn that multiple spells of three-hour loadshedding was being carried out in his area even during night-time for the past two weeks. 
“We have lodged several complaints with the K-Electric, but to no avail,” he said, adding that the inaction on part of the power utility was criminal.
Another resident, Muhammad Shahnawaz, said that the protesters took to street in Shah Faisal Colony No 2 against the unannounced and prolonged loadshedding in the vicinity at around 4pm, disrupting the vehicular traffic in the neighbourhood.
He said that the people ended the protest at around 8:30pm after heavy contingents of police and Rangers reached the spot and negotiated with the protesters.
The traffic mess forced a large number of women, including factory workers, to leave the vehicles they were travelling as most of them wanted to leave the traffic mess before dusk to avoid any untoward incident, such as mugging and eve-teasing.
“Our bus got stuck in the traffic on the Malir River Bridge at around 4:30pm and we finally left the bus and started walking to Shah Faisal Colony,” said a female factory worker.
Another worker at a biscuit factory in Korangi Industrial Area said that she and her colleagues were so frightened due to the tense situation in the protest that they also started heading to their homes on foot.
Meanwhile, a KE spokesperson stated that power supply to the city was currently continuing as per the schedule announced on June 30, which is also available on KE website.
The spokesperson added that difficulty in purchasing fuel and its short supply was affecting production capacity leading to load management.

6,Translating ancient texts,Betaali Prem Katha can be watched at National Academy of Performing Arts till 21st,"KARACHI: There’s a remarkable line in William Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar: “Ambition should be made of sterner stuff.” It is healthy to be ambitious, but the intention should be backed up by solid preparation in order to accomplish the targeted goal through it. 
Fawad Khan is a well-read graduate of the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) and now a well known and respected artist. If you are into stagecraft, the habit of reading prepares you to shine on stage. Therefore, his latest play Betaali Prem Katha written and directed by him that had its media night on Aug 13 at the academy was one of the most eagerly awaited attempts, primarily because it gave off a primitive vibe, something that has a distinct appeal for theatre lovers.
According to the description of the play provided by the academy, it is influenced by one of the ancient Sanskrit collection of tales Kathasaritsagara (Ocean of Rivers of Stories) by Somadeva. A mouth-watering prospect!
The story pivots around the character of a young man, Prem, (Rahil Siddiqui), a Brahmin and a knowledge seeker. In his search for wisdom he wanders into a city called Roopnagar where he meets a strange man, Betaal (Sunil Shanker) hanging off a tree. Knowing that Prem is looking for wisdom, he, by virtue of his mysterious and arguably perilous plan, sends him on a quest where he turns into a woman Premlata (Shabana Faizan). 

Betaali Prem Katha can be watched at National Academy of Performing Arts till 21st

Prem has already fallen weak in his knees for Rajkumari Chandrprabha (Iram Bashir), but when he meets her as Premlata, the situation takes an interesting turn. His gender-bending role becomes all the more intriguing when a man named Balram (Samhan Ghazi), despite being already married, falls for Premlata.
Betaali Prem Katha is nearly a two-hour-long script. Since Fawad Khan wanted to make it come across as nautanki, the good thing is that it doesn’t have many quiet moments because of which the audience’s attention remains undivided. Still, one does feel that the director has upstaged the writer, not by a long shot, though. 
The setting is pleasing to the eye; the live music is on-point; the performances — albeit a trifle loud especially by Shanker who seems to have too much on his plate by playing multiple roles — are fine; and the general ambience smacks of the days of yore, as it should. The text, on the other hand, appears to be stilted since Fawad uses too many Sanskrit words that are not unfamiliar — we get to hear them in Indian movies. Perhaps this is by design in order not to throw the audience off. 
But the overuse of utterances such as ‘parantu’ meaning ‘but’ also hints at the lexical limitation of the writer. Then there are words such as ‘khauf’ (fear) — which is Arabic — and ‘ajnabi’ (stranger) — which is Persian — that sound incongruous. That being said, these things are easily manageable. 
On the whole, the play that can be seen until Aug 21 needs to be given the nod of approval.

7,Madhubala to undergo ‘unique’ surgery at Karachi Zoo today,The elephant will finally undergo treatment for her damaged and infected tusks.,"KARACHI: Madhubala — one of the two elephants kept at Karachi Zoo who was caught and separated from her mother at a very young age in Tanzania and brought to Pakistan 14 years ago — will finally undergo treatment for her damaged and infected tusks on Tuesday (today) that has kept her in pain for several years. 
Thanks to concerned citizens and international experts who made the dental surgery possible. According to experts, the procedure is being carried out in a unique way and for the first time on an elephant. 
“Tomorrow is a big day. Our vets are arriving from Berlin and we plan to carry out two-tusk treatment under a ‘standing’ sedation which has been used to treat other animals (in the world), but never before elephants,” Dr Aamir Khalil of a global animal welfare group, Four Paws, told Dawn. 
Dr Khalil, along with his team members, visited the zoo on Monday morning, examined Madhubala and Noor Jahan, the other female pachyderm whose tusk surgery is scheduled for Wednesday (tomorrow), and made preparations for the procedure. 
The treatment, according to the experts, is so unique that they have to develop special equipment for it. 
Explaining the reason for choosing the innovative method, he said: “It’s much less invasive than the traditional approach, which is only possible under risky anesthesia and results in long post-surgery treatment with a higher risk of complications.” 
The surgery will be performed by two specialised veterinarians from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research from Berlin; Prof Thomas Hildebrandt and Dr Frank Göritz, also part of the team who will be arriving on Tuesday morning. 
The team will remove the dead tissues, clean the root canal, and teach the local team how to conduct regular post-treatment flushing to prevent inflammation and sustain hygiene of the wounds. 
“Both sides of the tusks are swollen, though the right side is a bit more. I can’t say anything right now about the infection’s severity till I have a closer examination tomorrow,” Dr Marina Ivanova said while talking about Madhubala’s condition. 
It’s hard to tell now how their tusks were broken as tissues had changed their form, she added. 
Sharing his observations, Mathias Otto, a trainer with over 30 years’ of zoo experience, said dental problems were quite painful that greatly affected behaviour of elephants, making them aggressive that could result in self injury. 
“I have trained the keepers here and those at the Safari Park in foot-care management. I also tame animals how to respond to keepers attending to their needs,” he explained. 
The team has been in constant contact with the local staff in Karachi since the previous year in November when the team had paid its first visit to the facility after the court took notice of the elephants’ misery housed in the zoo and Safari Park and issued orders to concerned officials to take steps for their wellbeing. 
The expert team submitted a detailed report to the court on the animals’ welfare previous year and plans to submit another document at the end of their visit. 
Josef Pfabigan, the chief executive officer of Four Paws, described the collaboration for elephants’ welfare as a great example for the rest of the world. 
“The animals have surely been in pain for many years. But, the positive thing is the society and the court took notice of their plight and took practical steps to help them out.” 
The cost for treatment is covered by the organisation which raised donations from supporters across the world. 
Mahera Omar representing the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society, a co-petitioner in the elephant case, said: “We are extremely grateful to Four Paws for providing the much-needed treatment to the elephants. We are praying that all goes well and the animals rehabilitate successfully. The unique surgery will surely open doors for other captive animals around the world.”

The party argued that the former PM’s character had already come under doubts after the verdict of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in the prohibited funding case.
The objection was formally submitted by PPP leader Nabil Gabol to the returning officer of NA-246. 
Last week, the PTI chairman had filed his nomination papers from three NA constituencies — NA-237 (Malir), NA-239 (Korangi) and NA-246 (South).
“The objection mainly carried the points in line with the verdict of the ECP in the prohibited funding case,” said a PPP leader citing the details. 
“The objection says that Imran Khan is the chief of the party which was found availing prohibited funding from a man convicted of fraud and from those individuals who are not Pakistanis. During the course of investigation, the PTI chief didn’t only tell a lie to the ECP but also filed a wrong affidavit. This whole exercise puts a serious question mark over the character of the PTI chief,” it said.

And the ruby red...,"KARACHI: The black colour around its lights reminded one of the panda or a male house sparrow. And the ruby red exterior of its prototype made it seem no less than a valuable gem. Nur-E 75, unveiled on Pakistan’s 75th Independence Day anniversary, hence the ‘75’ in its name, is the country’s first indigenous electric car, which also explains the presence of the ‘E’ in its name. 
The Electric Vehicle, or EV, is an offering from the Distinguished Innovations, Collaboration and Entrepreneurship (DICE) Foundation, a US non-profit organisation, run by Pakistani expatriates, which combined forces with local academia and automotive industry in 2019 to then found the car company JaXari, named after the 12th century scientist Ismael al-Jazari, which then designed and engineered the car.
The hatchback or little five-door family car is a need of our times as seen after the recent irrational fluctuations in petroleum prices. It can be plugged into a 220-volt outlet for seven to eight hours at home or you can have it fast charged through DC chargers. Fully charged, it can drive 210 kilometres with its air-conditioner on. 
According to DICE Chairman Dr Khurshid Qureshi, Nur-E is part of a revolution that will go a long way in lessening Pakistan’s dependence on fossil fuels. 
“Being global citizens, we also understand climate change and what needs to be done for our planet. The entire world is moving towards clean energy and Nur-E will take Pakistan at par with the rest of the world. It means sustainable economic prosperity for Pakistan,” he said. 
Dr Qureshi also said that after running tests on the prototype, JaXari, the car company, will be looking to design an electric sedan followed by a Sports Utility Vehicle or SUV.

13,Health dept asked to justify reposting of demoted LUH officer,"The non-cadre officer has lost cases in services tribunal, apex court","HYDERABAD: Sindh government has asked the health department to clarify the overall legal position regarding posting of demoted planning officer, Abdul Sattar Jatoi, in the Liaquat University Hospital (LUH) so that requirement under relevant provision of the Sindh Teaching Hos­pitals (Establishment of Manage­ment Board) Act 2020 could be met.
A two-page correspondence between the SGA&CD (Services, general administration and coordination department) and health department shared with Dawn by a health source) was issued on July 29, just two days after the officer was reposted in the LUH on the same position. 
The Sindh government had created the post by the nomenclature of director (administration, accounts and development) in BS-19 grade, an act regarding which the Supreme Court had observed that it was created as per wish list of the officer. 
It could, however, not immediately be confirmed whether Health Secretary Zulfikar Shah has responded to the letter or not. Mr Jatoi also did not respond to the queries sent to him by Dawn in this regard nor did he attend this reporter’s calls. 

The non-cadre officer has lost cases in services tribunal, apex court

The SGA&CD as in its letter referred to the Sept 22, 2020 decision of the Sindh Services Tribunal and subsequent Supreme Court verdict dated Jan 10, 2022 on the officer’s appeal against the tribunal’s order.
SGA&CD handles all posting/transfers of Sindh government officers serving in BS-19 and BS-20. Its July 29 letter has mentioned demotion and de-notification of the officer vide a notification dated May 16, 2022 following SC’s order and withdrawal of his promotion with the approval of the Sindh chief minister.
“Health department was further requested vide above referred letter to take further necessary action, if any, on relevant paras of judgment dated Sept 22, 2020 passed by Sindh Service Tribunal Karachi in Service Appeal no 1009 of 2019 filed by Ali Abbas son of Mohammad Hussain Khoso (senior colleague to Jatoi and ignored in promotion) forthwith, under intimidation to this department,” read the letter. 
It further stated: “It has been observed that no response from health department has been received with particular reference to para-3 of above letter”.
The SGA&CD has referred to para-14 of tribunal’s order in service appeal of Ali Abbas. In this para, the tribunal has emphatically ruled that “then the series of acts in favour of Abdul Sattar Jatoi taking him out of health department, re-designating clinical post of LUH Hyderabad/Jamshoro and making him director (admin, accounts and development) were also illegal and in violation of judgment [of Supreme Court”.
The SGA&CD wants Sindh health department to furnish specific comments with particular reference to para-14 of the judgement passed by the Sindh Service Tribunal. 
Referring to health department’s proposal for the officer’s posting, the SGA&CD discussed provisions of the Sindh Teaching Hospitals (Establishment of Management Board) Act 2020 while mentioning that health department had proposed his posting till the posting of a “suitable cadre officer” as the director (administration & procurement) in BS-19 in accordance with the Act.
The July 29 letter stated that on the July 26 proposal of health department, the officer was posted as director (administration, acco­unts & development) in BS-19 in LUH against an existing vacancy on July 27.
Now, SGA&CD requires clarification on the part of health department as per newly enacted legislation of the Sindh Teaching Hospitals (Establishment of Management Board) Act 2020. It wants the health department to clarify whether this posts is different from the post of director (administration & procurement) in BS-19 of the LUH.
“If reply [of health department] is in affirmative, health department may propose some ‘cadre officer’ against post of director (administration & procurement) BS-19 at earliest as per provision of Sindh Teaching Hospitals (Estab­lishment of Management Board) Act 2020.”
The Act says: “Sindh’s teaching hospitals would have separate posts of director administration/procurement and director finance. Clause 9(1) of the Act describes the procedure for appointment of director administration/procurement (who shall also be acting as secretary of concerned teaching hospital)”.
It says that CM shall appoint by transfer on tenure basis an experienced “senior cadre officer” not below the rank of BS-19 as director administration/procurement on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Board.
The Act has clearly explained that a ‘senior cadre officer’ is to be appointed as director administration for teaching hospitals while the incumbent officer is a non-cadre officer. 
The LUH management board under the chairmanship of Liaquat University of Medical & Health Sciences (LUMHS) vice chancellor Prof Dr Ikramuddin Ujjan, has lately, initiated process for appointment of director finance. The post of director finance has already been filled at the teaching hospitals of Karachi and Shaheed Bena­zirabad.
The Act’s clause 8-A says that CM shall appoint director finance for a period not exceeding three years from a panel of three candidates recommended by the board having such qualification and experience of managing finances, receipts, 
expenditure, funds and investments and shall be entitled for such remuneration and allowances as the CM may determine or by transfer on tenure basis from amongst the “cadre officers” of BS-19 having experience of accounts management.

While heavy rains in Khirthar mountain range, Kachho belt and other parts of Jamshoro and Dadu districts were continuing to pound the whole region with intermittent heavy, moderate and light spells, hill torrents were adding to the flows into the areas of Jhangara UC. 
Reports from the area suggested that at least 16 villages and several hundred acres of farmland had already been inundated and an unspecified number of families remained marooned in the flooding-hit UC.
The flows had filled Gabole dam to its full storage capacity a day earlier and with more rains and hill torrents flowing into it, the dam overtopped its banks on Monday evening. Flooding of villages one after the other triggered rumours of the dam having collapsed but the officials concerned kept clarifying that it was intact so far. However, families living away from the affected villages started moving to safe places fearing for their lives.
They appealed to the authorities concerned to save them and their hutments. 
The 16 inundated villages included Nawab Khan Rind, Ambh Khan Rind, Qurban Khan Rind, Punhoon Khan, Haji Chhato and Khaskheli. 
Meanwhile, chief engineer of the Small Dams Organisation, Sindh, Shafqat Hussain Wadho, when contacted by Dawn said that Gabole dam had neither collapsed nor was it damaged. He said overtopping of water posed no serious threat to local population.
“Since rainfall was continuing and hill torrents were turning the situation worrisome, officers and personnel of the organisation were put on alert and they were monitoring the situation closely,” he said.

15,Hindus protest death of 11 migrants from Pakistan,"Jodhpur police term the incident ‘mass suicide’, heirs in Sanghar refuse to believe the claim","HYDERABAD: Members of the shocked Hindu community in Sindh held a protest demonstration outside the local press club on Monday over “unbelievable” claim by the Indian authorities that 11 immigrants from Pakistan had committed mass suicide in Jodhpur on Sunday (Aug 14).
The protesters, led by Amarshi Thakur of the Pakistan Minorities Alliance, alleged that the immigrants were murdered, and appealed to the United Nations, European Union and International Court of Justice (ICJ) to intervene and ensure justice to the bereaved family. 
The protesters raised slogans against Indian government and the authorities concerned.
Mr Thakur said that the victims were members of a single family and originally residents of Sanghar district. They had gone to Jodhpur for pilgrimage some 15 months back, he added.

Jodhpur police term the incident ‘mass suicide’, heirs in Sanghar refuse to believe the claim

He said that their relatives in Sindh received information that they had committed joint suicide as claimed by the Jodhpur police. He said their relatives and the Hindu community in Sanghar disbelieved the claim.
Mr Thakur said that no medical examination reports of the deceased were shared with the bereaved family. He called for issuance of the medical examination reports and handing over of the bodies to their heirs.
The protesters said that it was disturbing to note the silence of human rights organisations in India over the deaths. All these organisations, he said, must exert pressure on Indian government for the handover of the bodies to the heirs.
According to a leading Indian newspaper, the 11 persons, who included five children, were found dead on Sunday morning inside the hut they lived in at Lodta village of Dechu area in Jodhpur. “The autopsies indicated consumption of a poisonous 
substance,” the paper quoted the local police as claiming. The police said there was a possibility that they had committed “mass suicide”.
A note found in the hut alleged threats from relatives of the wives of two members of the family and harassment by police, according to the newspaper’s report.

They were sharing their views at “provincial roundtable discussion with political parties to push for political commitments” against child marriage organised by Sujag Sansar Organisation (SSO), a non-governmental organisation, at Dadu Press Club on Monday. 
Mashoouqe Birhamani, CEO of SSO, said that child marriage was a global problem but Pakistan was among the countries where it had become more intense. His organisation had been working against this harmful practice since 2010 and highlighting the issue through awareness theater plays, he said.  
He said that child marriage was a raging problem in Sindh where outdated traditions, entrenched feudal system, lack of education and awareness and a host of other reasons aided the practice.  
He said that SSO with the support of Girls Not Brides and Blue Veins Islamabad was launching a campaign against child marriage in the province. The campaign was aiming to put the child marriage firmly on the agenda of decision-makers and call on them to take immediate action to address the issue, he said.  
The campaign would engage leaders at different levels to help end the outdated practice and empower girls. “We have conducted community radio programs, debate competitions, interactive theater plays and speak out forums and held meetings with political parties to push for political commitments,” he said. 
He said that elected representatives were key stakeholders of the campaign and they could play a vital role through highlighting human rights and child marriage issue in assemblies.  
He said that journalists could also play a very encouraging role in reporting and highlighting cases of human rights violation. 
Pakistan Peoples Party MPA Kulsoom Chandio said that child marriage was unlawful and punishable. Sindh Assembly had passed a law against child marriages in 2013 and but there was greater need to implement the law in letter and spirit, she said.  
She said that her political party was striving for the protection of women and would table strict laws in the assembly against perpetrators of the child marriage. 
Journalists of different electronic and print media outlets said that they would report child marriage cases effectively.  
Concluding the event’s proceedings the SSO representative said that it was very important that they should all play their role to check child marriage to save lives of hundreds of girls who fell victim to the harmful practice.  
Religious leaders and representatives of civil society organisations also participated in the event.

The participants in the protest organised by Sindh Mallah Forum took out a procession from Shaheed Allah Bakhsh Soomro Park and marched through the city. Some fishermen were carrying fish and others with empty hand carts in their hands used for selling fish as they reached DC Chowk where they burnt tyres and raised slogans against the district administration. 
The forum president Altaf Hussain Mirani and other members Afzal Mirani, Zahid Ali and Barkat Ali said that the Shikarpur-based influential person had deployed a group of armed men along a large portion of Begari Canal where no fisherman was allowed to fish to earn their livelihood. “When we go there to fish, the armed men beat us and threaten to kills us,” complained the protesters. 
They told media persons that they had legal licenses for fishing in the river but the influential man cared less about their lawful right. They appealed to authorities concerned to take action against the influential person and allow them to earn their living respectably by fishing in the canal. They warned if they were not allowed to fish in the water channel, they would expand their protest and also bring their women and children in the agitation.
