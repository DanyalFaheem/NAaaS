0,Pakistan’s debt burden up Rs11.8tr in FY22,The country's total debt and liabilities reached Rs59.696tr by June 30.,"KARACHI: The country’s total debt and liabilities increased by Rs11.85 trillion in FY22, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday.
The data, related to the domestic and external debts and liabilities, shows that Pakistan’s total debt and liabilities reached Rs59.696tr by June 30, compared to Rs47.844tr in FY21.
According to the SBP, the year-on-year growth in debt and liabilities was 24.8 per cent in FY22, compared to a growth of just 7.3pc in FY21.
The data also reveals that the total debt and liabilities as a percentage of GDP in FY22 was 89.2pc compared to 85.7pc in FY21.
Similarly, the total debt and liability servicing rose to Rs5.548 trillion in FY22 compared to Rs4.567tr in FY21. It increased by 21.6pc in FY22, compared to 2.5pc in FY21.
However, total debt and liability servicing remained unchanged as a percentage of GDP in the last two fiscal years, at 8.2pc in FY21 and FY22.
The central government’s gross domestic debt (without external debt) was Rs31.036tr by June 30, FY22, against Rs26.265tr by the end of June FY21.
Pakistan’s gross external debt reached $130.192 billion in FY22 compared to $122.292bn in FY21; it increased by $7.9bn. 
However, the general government’s external debt rose to $86.134bn in FY22 compared to $82.5bn in FY21.
Pakistan had to pay $15.071bn as external debt servicing in FY22, compared to $13.424bn in the previous fiscal year. The bifurcation shows that Pakistan paid $12.093bn as principal amount and $2.978bn as interest. The interest accounted for about 25pc of the principal.
The $15bn debt service is close to the amount of the current account deficit in FY22, which was $17.4bn. The current account deficit was much higher than the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves, which badly hit the exchange rate and the dollar rose to an all-time high of Rs239.5. Pakistan is struggling to come out of the current account deficit, for which the government has drastically reduced imports. However, the massive import cuts slashed the economy and would result in large job cuts in the industrial sector.
Public Sector Enterprise debt was slightly reduced during FY22. According to the data, PIA is the biggest debt owner in FY22 with Rs182bn compared to Rs153.3bn in FY21. Wapda was the second biggest debtor, with Rs72.5bn in FY22.

1,‘Higher localisation’ fails to deliver cheaper vehicles,"The levels of localisation in Suzuki Swift, Cultus, WagonR, and Alto660cc are 35pc, 51pc, 60pc, and 62pc, respectively.","KARACHI: The idea that higher localisation of auto parts translates into cheaper vehicles has proven to be unrealistic in Pakistan as motorcycles and cars have become pricier over the years.
In nearly 40 years of local vehicle assembly, falling rupee against the dollar has emerged as a major reason for an increase in auto prices. This gives the impression that no serious effort has been made to use large volumes of locally manufactured parts in vehicle assembly.
The country’s import bill of completely and semi-knocked (CKD/SKD) kits reached an all-time high of $1.7 billion in FY22, up from $1.11bn in FY21 due to low localisation in vehicles introduced by new entrants and in new vehicles offered by existing assemblers.
The Automotive Development Policy 2016-21 attracted new entrants who rolled out different varieties of cars. The industry assembled 279,000 vehicles in Pakistan in FY22.
Speaking to Dawn, Abdul Razzak Gauhar, the chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam), said, “localisation in terms of percentage is not authentic.”
“After the transition from the ‘deletion programme’ to the Tariff Based System (TBS) regime in 2006, the annual monitoring of localisation was stopped,” he said. Mr Gauhar claimed that the assemblers’ figures are based on the percentage of the number of parts localised rather than the percentage of localisation in terms of value.
The levels of localisation in the Suzuki Swift, Cultus, WagonR, and Alto660cc are 35pc, 51pc, 60pc, and 62pc, respectively.
The most astounding revelation came from the over three-decade-old Bolan and Ravi models, in which the share of locally made content was 72pc and 68pc, respectively. These two “legendary” Suzuki vehicles had only cosmetic changes rather than a full model change, with the addition of only a Euro-II engine.
The Suzuki Mehran remained on the assembly line for more than 30 years, with only a Euro-II engine change, 70pc localisation, and an outdated interior and exterior design, followed by the 16-year-old Cultus and the 12-year-old Alto 1,000 cc. No successive governments had ever checked Pak Suzuki’s achievements of a different kind.
Speaking to Dawn, an auto parts maker and former Paapam chairman, Mashood Ali Khan, said that the almost four-decade old engineering sector in the automotive industry could not indigenize parts to develop in Pakistan without technical collaboration of foreign partners.
He recalled that from 1990 to 2006, the country witnessed the initiative taken by two Pakistani engineers to develop local passenger cars and pickups but could not succeed in penetrating the market in the absence of government support.
In a recent corporate briefing, Honda Atlas Cars Limited (HACL) revealed that in terms of auto parts, localisation levels for Civic are 60pc, 70pc for City, and 50pc for BR-V.
However, in terms of the absolute amount of Pakistan rupees, the localisation level is around 30pc. The HCAL prefers to use local auto parts as compared to foreign components that meet their quality criteria. The company intends to further 
increase its localisation levels by using local auto parts given they meet the required quality standards.
Atlas Honda Limited (AHL) has reintroduced a decades-old CDI70cc motorcycle made up of 96pc locally sourced parts.

3,Oil tumbles on possible Iran deal,A deal would mean that Iran’s crude output of 2.5 million barrels per day would no longer be under international sanctions.,"LONDON: Oil prices slumped more than five per cent on Monday on the rising prospects of a return of Iranian oil to the market and data showing China’s economic recovery stuttering under Covid-19 restrictions.
Stock markets were broadly steady and the dollar traded mixed as investors welcomed signs of cooling US inflation, which nevertheless remains at the highest level in decades.
“The dark clouds of recession appear to be appearing when it comes to the global economy, with the latest China data reinforcing those fears,” said market analyst Michael Hewson at CMC Markets UK.
China’s central bank slashed key interest rates in a surprise move Monday as a raft of data showed weakness in the world’s second-largest economy.
Industrial production was up 3.8pc year-on-year, but down from 3.9pc in June and well below analysts’ forecasts.
Meanwhile, Iran’s foreign minister said Tehran would deliver its  “final” proposal later Monday on talks to revive its 2015 nuclear accord with world powers, after Washington had accepted key demands.
A deal would mean that Iran’s crude output of 2.5 million barrels per day would no longer be under international sanctions and help relieve supply constraints that have been pushing up prices.
Brent crude futures fell $4.35, or 4.43pc, to $93.80 a barrel by 1351 GMT after settling 1.5pc lower on Friday. 
US West Texas Intermediate crude was down $4.23, or 4.59pc, at $87.86 after dropping 2.4% in the previous session.

4,Energy sector reforms urged,Experts suggest immediate overhauling of governance while building institutional capacity.,"LAHORE: Experts have urged the government to immediately go for energy sector reforms along with decentralisation and deregulation of the sector in a bid to put the country on a sustainable path leading towards economic sovereignty.
In a letter addressed to the government, major politicians, and decision-makers, over two dozen independent experts from the energy, education, security, and monetary sectors proposed various reforms required to be introduced as soon as possible by the government.
“Since Pakistan’s economy is currently in severe distress—one of the worst economic crises in its history—due to high inflation, large twin deficits, dwindling foreign exchange reserves, a fast weakening currency and elevated Eurobond yields, its external and fiscal finances are crumbling under the overwhelming weight of energy costs,” the letter read.
“Imports, which account for 43 per cent of total primary energy supply in FY20, have been steadily increasing. At more than $26 billion, energy imports (oil, LNG, and coal) are the single biggest contributor to Pakistan’s current account deficit of $17.4 billion in FY22. It is tragic that a country endowed with large fossil fuel reserves and huge renewable resources meets more than two-fifth of its energy needs through imports, it added.
The experts suggest immediate overhauling of governance while building institutional capacity, as excessive government involvement is the central cause of the present state of affairs in the energy sector. According to them, for the sector to function properly, it must be decentralised and deregulated.
“The energy ministry’s role must be restricted to policy making and not actually running the energy sector entities. The energy ministry needs to be staffed with professionals with relevant sector knowledge and experience. Moreover, Nepra and Ogra must be turned into first-class regulatory bodies staffed with professionals,” the letter signed by the experts, 
including Aamir Khattak (security analyst), Abdul Rehman Warraich (Ex-Director General, Debt Office, MOF), Dr. Adeel Waqas (Professor of Economics, NUST) and Dr. Ashfaque Hassan Khan (Principal, School of Social Sciences & Humanities, NUST) said.
“Immediate relief to Pakistan’s external and fiscal finances can only come from adherence to strict energy conservation measures,” the document added.
The experts suggest the introduction of daylight saving timing by moving clocks forward by at least one hour; the closure of shopping centres by 7pm; restaurants/wedding halls by 10pm; bank branches by 2pm; all public/private offices at 5pm; and the reduction of school working days to four per week with longer hours per working day and switching off alternate street lights.
They further recommend reallocating unused gas commitments, encouraging third-party sales at bilaterally negotiated prices, and increasing wellhead prices for older fields and tight gas reserves to increase natural gas production. They further suggest electrification of energy use, as according to them, out of the 80.6 million TOEs of Pakistan’s primary energy consumption in FY20, 50pc went into electricity generation, 21pc in transportation and 11pc in the residential sector.
While desiring energy efficiency and the removal of price anomalies, they urged the decision makers to make the ongoing situation Pakistan’s last economic crisis by resolving them forever.
