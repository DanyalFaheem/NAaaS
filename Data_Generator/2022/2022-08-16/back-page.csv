0,Suu Kyi jailed for six years over corruption,"US slams latest sentencing as ""affront to justice""; EU calls for her immediate release.","YANGON: A Myanmar junta court jailed Aung San Suu Kyi for six years for corruption on Monday, a source close to the case said, taking the ousted leader’s prison time to 17 years.
Suu Kyi, 77, has been detained since the generals toppled her government in a coup on February 1 last year, ending the Southeast Asian country’s brief period of democracy. She has since been hit with a series of charges, including violating the official secrets act, corruption and electoral fraud. She faces decades in jail if convicted on all counts.
She was sentenced to “six years’ imprisonment under four anti-corruption charges”, said the source, who requested anonymity bec­a­use they were not authorised to speak to the media.
Each charge carried a maximum of 15 years in jail. Suu Kyi was sentenced to three years for each, but three of the sentences would be served concurrently, the source said.

US slams latest sentencing as ‘affront to justice’; EU calls for her immediate release

She appeared in good health and did not make any statement following the sentencing, the source added.
A junta spokesman could not be reached for comment.
The Nobel laureate had already been sentenced to 11 years in jail for corruption, incitement against the military, breaching Covid-19 rules and breaking a telecommunications law.
Journalists have been barred from attending the court hearings and Suu Kyi’s lawyers have been banned from speaking to the media.
The US slammed the latest sentencing as an “affront to justice and the rule of law”.
“We call on the regime to immediately release Aung San Suu Kyi and all those unjustly detained, including other democratically elected officials,” a State Department spokesperson said.
“The Burma military regime’s unjust arrest, conviction, and sentencing of Aung San Suu Kyi is an affront to justice and the rule of law,” a State Department spokesperson said, using the country’s former name.
Also, EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned the “unjust” sentencing of Suu Kyi and called for her immediate release. “I condemn the unjust sentence of Aung San Suu Kyi to an additional six years of detention,” Borrell wrote on Twitter, calling on the Myanmar regime to “immediately and unconditionally release her”.
He also urged the Asian nation’s military junta to release “all political prisoners, and respect the will of the people”.

 





 
The coup sparked widespread protests and unrest, and renewed fighting with established ethnic rebel groups.
Dozens of “People’s Defence Forces” have also sprung up to fight the junta and have surprised the military with their effectiveness, analysts say.
According to a local monitoring group, the crackdown has left more than 2,000 civilians dead and seen some 17,000 arrested.
Suu Kyi has been the face of Myanmar’s democratic hopes for more than 30 years, but her earlier 11-year sentence already meant she was likely to miss elections the junta says it plans to hold by next year.
She remains confined to the jail, with her link to the outside world limited to brief pre-trial meetings with lawyers.
Many of her political allies have also been arrested since the coup, with one chief minister sentenced to 75 years in jail.

KABUL: As the jubilant Taliban celebrated on Monday to mark the first anniversary of their return to power in Afghanistan, despondent Afghans, whose hardships have multiplied since the takeover say that life has lost its meaning.
The Taliban fighters celebrated by chanting victory slogans next to the US embassy that suspended its operations last year. The Taliban captured Kabul exactly a year ago, after a nationwide lightning offensive against government forces just as US-led troops were ending two decades of intervention in a conflict that cost tens of thousands of lives.
“This great victory came after countless sacrifices and hardships,” Abdul Ghani Baradar, deputy prime minister and co-founder of the Taliban movement, said on Twitter.
“On this day... the Islamic Emirate brought the world’s superpower and its allies to their knees and Afghans gained their independence,” added Baradar.
The last American troops left on Aug 31, ending a chaotic evacuation of tens of thousands of Afghans who had rushed to Kabul’s airport in the hope of boarding a flight out of the country.
Images of crowds storming the airport, climbing atop aircraft — and some clinging to a departing US military cargo plane as it rolled down the runway — aired on news bulletins around the world.
“We fulfilled the obligation of jihad and liberated our country,” said Niamatullah Hekmat, a fighter who entered the capital on Aug 15 last year just hours after then-president Ashraf Ghani fled the country.
Many Taliban fighters gathered in Kabul’s central Massoud Square, where they displayed the regime’s white banners and performed a traditional victory dance, some holding weapons and others taking pictures on their mobile phones. “We all are happy that we are celebrating our independence in front of the US embassy,” fighter Aminullah Sufi Omar told AFP.
However, for many ordinary Afghans — particularly women — the return of the Taliban has only increased hardships, with aid agencies saying that half the country’s 38 million people face extreme poverty.
Initially, the Taliban promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001. But since the takeover, many restrictions have been imposed on women. “Since the day they have come, life has lost its meaning,” said Ogai Amail, a resident of Kabul.
“Everything has been snatched from us, they have even entered our personal space,” she added.
Taliban fighters on Saturday dispersed a rare women’s rights rally by firing gunshots into the air and beating some protesters.
“Our call for justice was silenced with gunfire, but today we are pleading from inside our home,” Munisa Mubariz said on Monday.
She was among about 30 women who gathered at an undisclosed location to stage an indoor protest.
The women, who mostly had their faces uncovered, posted photographs online of themselves holding banners, including one that read: “Afghanistan’s history is tarnished with the closure of girls’ schools.”
While Afghans acknowledge a decline in violence since the Taliban seized power the humanitarian crisis has left many helpless.
“People coming to our shops are complaining so much of high prices that we shopkeepers have started hating ourselves,” said Noor Mohammad, a shopkeeper from Kandahar.
The country is in an economic crisis, with its overseas assets frozen by Washington and aid curtailed in order to keep funds out of the Taliban’s hands.
For Taliban fighters, the joy of victory overshadows the current economic crisis.
“We might be poor, we might be facing hardships, but the white flag of Islam will now fly high forever in Afghanistan”, said a fighter guarding a public park in Kabul.

2,Prince Talal’s $500m investment in Russia revealed,Investment firm controlled by him quietly invested over $500m in three Russian energy companies between February and March.,"Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding Co, the investment firm controlled by billionaire Prince Alwa­leed Bin Talal, quietly invested more than $500 million in three major Russian energy companies between February and March, regulatory filings showed.
By investing in Gazprom, Rosneft and Lukoil, Kingdom was likely seeking undervalued assets, but its move came as many Western nations imposed sanctions on Russian energy firms and their executives following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24.
In February, Kingdom Holding invested in global depository receipts of Gazprom and Roseneft worth 1.37 billion riyals ($365 million) and 196 million riyals ($52 million), respectively.
The firm also invested 410 million riyals ($109 million) in Lukoil’s US depository receipts between February and March, filings showed on Sunday as part of a lengthy disclosure of recent investments. It gave no reason for any of its specific investments.
The company, which is 16.9 per cent owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund chaired by crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman, had not previously revealed the details of its investments.
Prince Alwaleed bin Talal rose to international prominence after making a big successful bet on Citigroup Inc in the 1990s, and was an early investor in Apple Inc.
The prince has also made hundreds of millions of dollars by investing in companies such as Uber Techn­ologies Inc to Twitter Inc.
Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have so far tried to maintain what they say is a neutral position on the war in Ukraine, frustrating some Western officials who have sought to isolate Russia over the invasion.

3,"US, Pakistan discuss options for Gen Bajwa’s visit to DC","Visit likely to take place in late August or early September, a date will be finalised soon, say sources.","WASHINGTON: The United States and Pakistani officials are considering various options for Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Qamar Bajwa to visit the United States in late August or early September, diplomatic sources told Dawn.
“A date will soon be finalized,” a source said. Since the visit has not yet been officially confirmed, neither side has announced the agenda of the talks Gen Bajwa is likely to hold in Washington.
But diplomatic circles and think-tank experts point out that both sides have been trying to arrange such a visit for more than a year now. They also refer to various recent events and statements that might be discussed if and when Gen Bajwa visits Washington.
“We remain engaged with a range of stakeholders in Pakistan, (including) those currently in the government” and with “a broad array of others,” the department’s spokesperson Ned Price said.
Last month, Gen Bajwa reached out to Washington to request help in securing an early disbursement of funds from the IMF. He spoke with US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and later a State Department official rejected media speculations that the call was linked to the current political situation in Pakistan.
Later, Gen Bajwa also spoke with Commander US Centcom Gen Michael Erik Kurilla and, according to an official statement, the two discussed “matters of mutual interests, regional stability as well as defence and security cooperation in detail.”

4,"Why polio is turning up in UK, US now","Polio is spreading in London, New York and Jerusalem for the first time in decades, spurring catch-up vaccination campaigns.","LONDON: Polio, a deadly disease that used to paralyse tens of thousands of children every year, is spreading in London, New York and Jerusalem for the first time in decades, spurring catch-up vaccination campaigns.
Polio terrified parents around the world for the first half of the 20th century. Affecting mainly children under five, it is often asymptomatic but can also cause symptoms including fever and vomiting. Around one in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis, and among those patients, up to 10 per cent die.
There is no cure, but since a vaccine was found in the 1950s, polio is entirely preventable. Globally, the wild form of the disease has almost disappeared. Afghanistan and Pakistan are now the only countries where the highly infectious disease, spread mainly through contact with faecal matter, remains endemic.
However, this year, imported cases were also found in Malawi and Mozambique, the first in those countries since the 1990s.
Different strains
There are two main forms of poliovirus. Alongside the wild-type outlined above, there are also rare cases of what is known as vaccine-derived polio.
It is this second form detected in wastewater in the British capital, London, and in New York in the United States, with one case of paralysis reported in New York state.
Genetically similar virus has also been found in Jerusalem, Israel, and scientists are working to understand the link, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) said.
While vaccine-derived polio is almost unheard of in the above locations, it is a known, albeit rare, threat in other countries, causing outbreaks every year, including 415 cases in Nigeria in 2021.
It stems from the use of an oral polio vaccine containing weakened live virus. After children are vaccinated, they shed virus in their faeces for a few weeks. In under-vaccinated communities, this can then spread and mutate back to a harmful version of the virus.
While countries including the Britain and the United States no longer use this live vaccine, others do, particularly to stop outbreaks, which allows for global spread, particularly as people began to travel again after Covid-19, experts said.
Why now?
But experts agree that the major driver behind both vaccine-derived and wild polio outbreaks remains under-vaccinated populations, said Derek Ehrhardt, global polio lead at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Vaccine hesitancy was a growing problem before the pandemic, then Covid-19 caused the worst disruption to routine immunisation in a generation, according to the UN.
In 2020, there were 1,081 vaccine-derived polio cases, around three times as many as the previous year. In 2022 so far, there have been 177 cases, after major efforts to get polio vaccination campaigns back on track.

5,MQM terms Sindh LG law ‘discriminatory’,"SLGA-2013 deprives Muttahida of any opportunity to have its own mayor in Karachi, SC told.","ISLAMABAD: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) on Monday told the Supreme Court that Section 10(1) of the Sindh Local Government Act (SLGA), 2013, was discriminatory as it deprived the party of any opportunity to have its own mayor to serve Karachi and other cities of the province.
Representing the petitioner, MQM Convenor Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Barrister Dr Farogh Naseem argued before the top court that through section 10(1) of the SLGA, the Sindh government had violated the Supreme Court’s 2014 directions in which the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was empowered to delimit local government constituencies under Article 140-A, 218 and 222 of the Constitution and the federal, Sindh and Punjab governments were asked to make laws to enable the ECP to delimit constituencies of local governments.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, the Supreme Court bench also comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Ayesha Malik, had taken up a set of petitions filed by MQM, PTI and others against the SLGA.
The counsel said that an attempt had been made to reduce voters’ strength in areas where Muttahida Qaumi Movement was in popularity, adding that for election of mayor, the petitioner’s one basic constituency votes had been made equal to three basic constituencies votes of PPPP.

SLGA-2013 deprives Muttahida of any opportunity to have its own mayor in Karachi, SC told

Presenting a comprehensive chart of different districts of Karachi, Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas, the counsel said that the population variation of different union councils (UCs) were well beyond the scope of permissible and accepted 10pc variation under Section 20(3 and 4) of the Elections Act, 2017, that too without assigning any reason.
To substantiate his claim, the counsel cited the example of District West, Karachi, where eight UCs have been created in Orangi Town for a population of 697,233, nine UCs of Mominabad for a population of 417,460 and 16 UCs of Manghopir for a population of 909,340.
The average population of Orangi Town, the counsel said, was 82,000 per UC, 50,000 per UC in Mominabad and 55,000 per UC in Manghopir.
“Thus in places where the petitioner (MQM) is popular, constituencies have been created on a large population count like 70,000 to 90,000, whereas places where the petitioner has less vote bank, constituencies of 30,000 or 40,000 population count have been created,” the counsel said.
Through Section 10(1) of the Sindh Local Government Act, the counsel said, the government had been given authority to determine or create basic constituencies, inter alia, union councils and union committees, adding that the chairmen of UCs constituted the electoral college for the election of the mayor or head of the municipal/metropolitan corporations.
“This classic case of gerrymandering orchestrated through Section 10(1) of the SLGA,” the counsel regretted, was unlawful and unconstitutional delimitation beyond the permissible 10pc population, done at a very large scale by delimitation committees.
The case will be taken up again on Tuesday (today).

6,"Decision on Gill’s bail plea delayed, Tarrar gets protective bail",• PTI delegations ‘denied’ meeting with Imran’s chief of staff at Adiala • Party to launch anti-govt push from Aug 19,"• PTI delegations ‘denied’ meeting with Imran’s chief of staff at Adiala
• Party to launch anti-govt push from Aug 19
ISLAMABAD: While the additional district and sessions judge on Monday delayed a decision on the post-arrest bail petition of PTI leader Shahbaz Gill due to litigation, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) granted protective bail to PML-N leader Atta Tarrar.
Judge Zeba Chaudhry put off the bail plea of Mr Gill, who is facing a case of inciting mutiny, after the court was informed that record was lying with IHC in connection with a petition filed by the Advocate General, Islamabad, against the order of a judicial magistrate for denying custody of the suspect to the police on physical remand.
The IHC, meanwhile, granted protective bail to Special Assistant to PM Atta Tarrar in the FIR registered against him in connection with May 25 violence during the PTI’s long march.
His counsel told the court that Qila Gujjar Singh Police of Lahore had booked him and raided his house.
Acting Chief Justice of IHC Justice Farooq granted protective bail to Mr Tarar for a fortnight.
The PTI decided that delegations headed by Ali Awan, Malik Aamir Dogar and Dr Shahzad Wasim would meet Mr Gill and inform Imran Khan about his condition and suggest further line of action.
PTI not allowed meeting with Gill
After not coming to see Dr Gill for almost a week, PTI leaders decided to meet him in jail on Monday. However, the administration of Adiala Jail did not allow the meeting.
Only one delegation — headed by Ali Awan — reached the jail to meet Imran Khan’s chief of staff.
Mr Awan, while talking to Dawn, said he was informed by the jail administration that they could meet Mr Gill.
“We waited there for almost two hours but then we were informed that meeting was not possible. While we were leaving we received a call from DIG to return as he had got approval to arrange a meeting,” he said.
“We again went to jail and waited there for another two hours. Tea was served to us but meeting with Mr Gill was not allowed,” he said. “Now we will approach the court to get permission for a meeting with Mr Gill.”
Anti-govt movement
Besides, PTI has decided to launch an anti-government movement from Aug 19.
PTI senior vice president Fawad Chaudhry announced that PTI would launch a well-conceived countrywide anti-government movement to send the current “imported” setup packing, which was “destroying Pakistan economically and politically”.
Talking to the media, he said Mr Khan would address public gatherings in major cities.
He said the PTI chairman would launch the anti-government movement from Karachi on Aug 19, adding that he would hold rallies till Sept 10 in various parts of the country.
He said what was happening to Mr Gill was the height of injustice and the entire party stood with him in solidarity. He expressed the apprehension that Mr Gill could be kidnapped so as to get a certificate from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences. The PTI, he added, would take up the issue of Mr Gill’s torture globally.
He said Mr Gill was being targeted because he was a weak person, though his case was similar to Nawaz Sharif, Fazlur Rehman and Maryam Safdar’s who had made similar remarks.
Talking about PM’s offer of national dialogue on Charter of Economy, Mr Fawad termed the proposal a foolish idea, as the PTI could not support the “destructive” economic policy of “crooks” that brought the country on the verge of economic collapse.
He alleged that the government was trying to create a rift in the judiciary, adding that people did not forget the era of Rafiq Tarar when the judiciary was divided. He said PTI would hold a “judiciary independence day” on Monday.
He also said PTI would observe press freedom day on Aug 18 to express solidarity with journalists who are facing coercion and torture at the hands of the government.
In addition, party chairman Imran Khan has issued the directives to former human rights minister Dr Shireen Mazari to take up the issue of “gagging” the media with Amnesty International.
Fawad Chaudhry ruled out talks with the “corrupt” government. He, however, said talks could only be held on a framework for holding early, free and transparent polls, adding that snap polls were the only solution to steer the country out of the crises.
Coming down hard on ECP, he said PTI had no trust on the electoral body, which had “worked as a subsidiary of the government”.
