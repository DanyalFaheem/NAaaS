MAREHRA, also reverently known as Marehra Sharif, is a city in district of Etah, UP, India. Those who belong to Marehra are often in Urdu referred to as Marehravi.
Though famous in the world for Muslim shrines and Hindu temples, Marehra is known in the world of Urdu literature because of Ahsan Marehravi, a poet, critic, teacher, journalist, lexicographer, linguist and research scholar.
What makes Ahsan Marehravi standout is his keen interest in Urdu orthography, lexicography and problems related to language — and that too in an era when little was written and discussed in Urdu on linguistic issues.
Born on Nov 10, 1876, in Marehra, Ahsan Marehravi’s real name was Syed Ali Ahsan. His ancestors were known for their spiritual leanings and looked after a khanqah, which is a building specifically used for spiritual teachings and where Muslim Sufis and students of religious studies can stay (in some parts of the world, a khanqah is called zaviyah or takiya, too). 
So Ahsan Marehravi’s education began at his ancestral khanqah. Here he studied Arabic, Persian, Urdu and memorised Quran. In those days a school was opened in Marehra where English was taught. Young Ahsan secretly began attending the school and got an English primer. As mentioned by Ahsan Marehravi in one of his poems quoted in Nuqoosh (Shakhsiyaat Number), his father was furious when he learnt that Ahsan had begun learning English and stopped him from going to school.
Ahsan began composing poetry at an early age. In 1896, he launched an Urdu magazine Riaz-i-Sukhan, when he was 20. The same year, he requested Mirza Daagh Dehlvi (1831-1905), the renowned poet of Urdu known for his outstanding use of idiomatic expressions, to admit him to the circle of his disciples, which Daagh approved of. This proved to be a landmark in Ahsan’s life as when he moved to Hyderabad Deccan in 1898, where Daagh lived in those days, he swiftly assumed the responsibilities of Daagh’s de facto private secretary on  an honorary basis. And thus began a long-drawn training in poetics, prosody, criticism, linguistic skills, rhetorical techniques and lexicology that helped shape Ahsan’s personality and hone his skills.
In Deccan, Ahsan began writing Daagh’s biography, titled Jalva-i-Daagh’. He was envious of Ameer Meenai’s dictionary Ameer-ul-Lughaat and wanted someone from Delhi to compete and compile a greater dictionary as Ameer was from Lucknow. So he suggested compiling another dictionary with citations from Daagh’s poetry for the sake of authenticity. 
Initially, he named the dictionary Faiz-i-Daagh, but later on changed it to Faseeh-ul-Lughaat, since Daagh’s title was ‘Faseeh-ul-Mulk’. Ahsan began compiling the dictionary with Daagh’s approval and support. But in 1903, he had to leave Deccan for Marehra owing to some familial issues and could not go back to Deccan despite Daagh’s displeasure. In March 1905 Daagh died and the dictionary remained unfinished and unpublished.
In 1905, Ahsan went to Lahore, which had become a centre of learning and publishing. In Lahore, he worked for Lala Siri Ram who was compiling an Urdu ‘tazkira’ named Khum Khana-i-Javed. A few months later Ahsan joined Lahore’s Mufeed-i-A’am Press. In May 1905, he launched monthly Faseeh-ul-Mulk form Lahore and began publishing in it Faseeh-ul-Lughaat in instalments. In April 1906, he had to move back to Marehra and the magazine was re-launched from there. Despite its invaluable articles, book review and editorials, the magazine could not survive and had to be closed down. Its last issue was published in August 1910.
Faseeh-ul-Mulk is among those few Urdu journals that were launched to addressing exclusively the linguistic and lexicographic issues. Later on, Urdu Dictionary Board’s Urdu Nama and Muqtadira Qaumi Zaban’s Akhbar-i-Urdu were launched with the same aims. Faseeh-ul-Mulk discussed issues that had never been touched in Urdu magazines before and just a cursory glance can make one realise the significance of the articles published in it: research on the letter ‘Zaal-e-M’ujama’ (an issue that was much debated later on), the use of haa-i-havvaz, the word chaahiyye and its usage, inclusion of new word in Urdu, use of English words in Urdu, gender of Arabic words used in Urdu, Urdu orthography, suggestions for Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu, animal sounds in Urdu, and the list goes on.
In 1921, Ahsan joined Aligarh College to teach Urdu and was later on absorbed in Aligarh University’s Urdu department. He especially went to Lahore to attend Muslim League’s rally on March 23, 1940, where Pakistan Resolution was approved.
His other books include: Bazm-i-Daagh, Zaban-i-Daagh, Jalva-i-Ahsan, Ahsan-ul-Kalam, Tareekh-i-Nasr-e-Urdu: Namoona-i-Mansooraat, Insha-i-Daagh and some others.
Ahsan Marehravi went to Patna for treatment but died there on August 30, 1940, and was buried in Marehra the next day.

2,PTI to challenge ban on live telecast of Imran’s speeches,"Fawad says PTI chief did not ‘threaten’ anyone, only sought action over Gill’s torture; Gill goes on ""hunger strike"".","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has decided to approach courts against a ban imposed by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) on the live telecast of the speeches of former prime minister and party chairman Imran Khan in light of his remarks against the judiciary and the police during a rally in Islamabad on Saturday. 
This was shared by PTI senior central vice president Fawad Chaudhry during a press conference here on Sunday. Imran Khan did not say anything illegal nor did he hurl threats during the F-9 Park rally, claimed Mr Chaudhry as he advised the coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take on Mr Khan politically instead of resorting to bans. 
On Saturday, while addressing a rally in Islamabad to express solidarity with PTI leader Dr Shahbaz Gill facing proceedings in a sedition case, Mr Khan warned the judiciary against its “biased” attitude and warned the judge who sent Mr Gill on physical remand to brace for consequences. Subsequently, a ban was imposed on the live broadcast of Imran Khan’s speeches and a case was also registered against him on Sunday. 
Mr Chaudhry said Imran Khan only asked for “legal action” against the individuals who allegedly tortured his chief of staff, Shahbaz Gill, in custody. The PTI leader reiterated his demand for an independent commission to probe torture allegations. He added that the reluctance to constitute the commission raised many questions. The PTI leader also questioned the decision to bar Imran Khan and other PTI leaders from meeting Shahbaz Gill. He claimed that Mr Gill had shared the details of the alleged torture he had “endured for hours” at a police station.

Fawad says PTI chief did not ‘threaten’ anyone, only sought action over Gill’s torture; Gill goes on ‘hunger strike’

Commenting on Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, the former information minister said Mr Sanaullah himself had been tortured in the past but he was still treating the alleged torture of Mr Gill as an ordinary issue.
Speaking about cases against PTI Chairman Imran Khan, Mr Chaudhry claimed that a conspiracy was being hatched to disqualify the former premier in a bid to pave way for the return of PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif to mainstream politics. The democracy in the country, however, now revolved around Imran Khan, he claimed. The first phase of the public movement had begun with a public meeting in Rawalpindi, he said and hoped that the government would not force the PTI to start the second phase before Sept 10.
Gill on ‘hunger strike’
Meanwhile, incarcerated PTI leader Shahbaz Gill, who has been in the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) owing to health reasons, went on a “hunger strike” and refused to cooperate with the medical board constituted to ascertain the alleged torture of the PTI leader.
According to a letter dated Aug 21, the new medical board comprised four members, whereas two more members have been co-opted. The board is headed by Dr Shafaat Khatoon (General Medicine) and other members included Dr Tariq Abdullah, Dr Ziaul Haq and Dr Salman Shafi Kaul. 
The co-opted members, Dr Farrukh Kamal and Dr Muhammad Naseer, have been tasked with the medico-legal report.
A doctor at Pims, requesting anonymity, claimed that Mr Gill went on a hunger strike on Saturday evening.
“On Saturday, all of Gill’s tests were normal. Members of the medical board on Sunday went to him to collect samples for the tests again but Gill refused. He was also requested to cooperate for the medico-legal report to determine any torture but he refused,” he said.

3,Balochistan: A picture of misery,The second phase of floods has further compounded the problems and woes of people in Balochistan.,"AT the time of writing these lines, Quetta’s roads and streets are inundated due to the recent unrelenting rains.  Nawa Killi, Sabzal road and Brewery road  in the provincial capital are dotted with damaged mud and pucca houses and collapsed walls. Unlike Quetta, the rest of Balochistan lives largely in mud houses. It is getting disconnected from Quetta as time goes by. 
Floods and unabated rains have wreaked havoc on the province. Some of the worst-affected places have hardly found mention in the media.
Nushki, a district bordering Afghanistan, is a case in point. Situated some 140km to the south-west of Quetta, it’s a picture of devastation. The floods have washed away a large number of mud houses in the district. 
The most badly-hit towns are Batto and Killi Qadirabad. 
According to Hafiz Abdul Samad, a councillor in Killi Qadirabad, over one hundred houses have been wiped out in his union council alone. “We rescued many people on our own,” he told Dawn. 
“But as soon as we began the rebuilding process, a fresh spell of rains again wreaked havoc on our area. Our misery stands compounded.” 
“Everything is gone,” says Abdul Rashid, who hails from Qadirabad. “We live in tents along with our joint family. The rain refuses to relent, filling us with doom and gloom.”  
Haji Usman, yet another sufferer, says with resignation: “We are at the mercy of God.” His house was one among many that were washed away by floods in Batto, a town which lies on the Quetta-Taftan highway. 
The place is now veritably a ghost town as most of the inhabitants have sought refuge in other areas.
Roads in the town are almost impassable. Most of the drivers do not use them. But Hashim had an emergency. “My wife was unwell,” he said, adding that “we took courage in our hands and decided to go to Quetta. At first it looked as though mud and water would swallow us. But thank God, we eventually made it to Quetta in one piece.”
Hashim implored the authorities to help the flood victims and restore highways connecting Quetta to other towns.  
By and large, the entire Balochistan is in the throes of floods. Reports of devastation take time to come out of most parts due to their remoteness. 
Musakhail district, in the upper region of the province, is one such place. Thirteen people have lost their lives here so far.
Many people are dependent on agriculture and livestock. “But floods have taken away all that from us,” laments Asghar while talking to Dawn. “Why was I alive to see this destruction in our village.”
Yasir Iqbal Dashti, the deputy commissioner of Musakhail, says: “The administration is not indifferent to the misery. We have rescued 700 people so far and accommodated them in government buildings.” 
More than 300 families have been provided with relief goods, he added. 
Second phase
The second phase of floods has further compounded the problems and woes of people in Balochistan. It has killed 12 people, and most of the deaths have been reported from Jafferabad, Barkan, and Khuzdar districts.   
All the highway connecting Quetta with other provinces are either closed or suspended. “If we open one highway, the fresh floods and rains block it once again,” says a Quetta-based official. 
“We have our representatives in all the district of Balochistan,” contends Younas Mengal, who is in charge of the control room of Provincial Disaster Management Auth­ority’s (PDMA) Balochistan chapter. “Along with local NGOs, we provide rations, tents and other rescue and relief operations to the flood victims wherever the flood has wreaked havoc.”
“Within June, July and August, 216 people have died due to floods in Balochistan while over 30 thousand houses are damaged,” he adds. “We are trying to reach out to flood victims in every nook and corner of the province along with the collaboration of district administrations and others.” 
“If demands rise, we will request to higher authorities for the assistance,” he concludes. “As of now, NDMA (National Disaster Management Auth­ority) is also involved in the relief works in Balochistan.”   
PDMA officials say FC and local administration are also participating in relief and rescue activities.
Saeed, a resident of Quetta, says his house was inundated with water on Sunday due to downpour at Chaman Patak, in Quetta. As a result, he has shifted his family to a relative’s house. “If it is the situation in Quetta, in the heart of city, one can assume what may others face in the far away corners of Balochistan, where there is no cellular network, let alone other facilities?” he says while discussing the flood situation in Balochistan.

4,IMF board members get staff reports,"IMF deal with Pakistan may include strict conditions on governance, aimed at curbing financial corruption, say sources.","WASHINGTON: Pakistan has moved closer to clinching a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as all 24 members of the Fund’s executive board have received copies of a staff report required to complete the process, diplomatic and IMF sources told Dawn. 
The board is meeting on Aug 29 to consider the report on the completion of seventh and eighth reviews of $6 billion loan package signed in 2019. The board will also consider to extend the facility till June 2023. 
The documents distributed among the members included a letter of intent from Pakistan, spelling out the country’s plans to meet the IMF’s conditions for reforming the economy. 
Pakistan had also submitted a memorandum of understanding on economic and financial policies, along with a technical MoU submitted by the IMF team.
The IMF staff’s memoranda comprised studies and reports prepared for the board, such as those for Article IV consultations, papers on selected issues, statistical annexes, and policy papers. 
During the Aug 29 meeting, Pakistan will also submit documents on prior actions and priorities, which will later  be included in the meeting’s records. 
The so-called gray documents — circulated before the meeting — include the preliminary version of executive directors’ statements to the board. The executive board has also received a rough draft of the press release that would be released if the proposed package for Pakistan is approved. 
The IMF deal with Pakistan may include strict conditions on governance, aimed at curbing financial corruption, sources have told Dawn.
“There’s a feeling among international circles that anti-corruption measures introduced by the previous government were too restrictive and often prevented officials from taking major decisions,” one of the sources said.
“But the present government has taken the sting out of anti-corruption tools, which may encourage corruption. The IMF would prefer to have an arrangement that could curb corruption but was not restrictive.” 
Reports in the international media claimed that the IMF has asked Pakistan to set up an anti-corruption task force to review all the existing laws that were aimed at curbing graft in the government departments. 
According to repots, the new conditions could also require politicians and government officials to declare their assets.
Pakistan and the IMF have already reached an agreement on some of these measures. 
On July 13, the IMF announced that it had reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan to further the under the review of its Extended Fund Facility (EFF) that could bring total disbursements by the Fund to about $4.2 billion. 
The agreement was subjected to approval from the IMF’s executive board. 
After the Aug 29 meeting, Pakistan may immediately receive about $1.2bn, which could help ease pressure on the nation’s currency and reserves.
Moreover, the IMF loan may unlock more financing from other bilateral sources and lenders. 
The July 13 agreement pointed out that the immediate priority to stabilise the economy was the steadfast implementation of the 2023 budget. 
It also suggested continued adherence to a market-determined exchange rate and a proactive and prudent monetary policy. The document also stressed the importance of expanding social safety to protect and accelerate structural reforms, including improving the performance of state-owned enterprises and governance.

5,Unrest in Hyderabad after alleged desecration of Quran,"Police pick up sanitary worker, register FIR against him; law enforcers fire tear gas to disperse enraged mob.","HYDERABAD: Law enfo­rc­ement agencies resorted to tear gas shelling and fired into the air in different areas of Hyderabad on Sunday following an incident of alleged desecration of the Holy Quran. 
A policeman was assau­lted while a police mobile was damaged by a mob.  
Enraged crowds forced their way into a business centre by breaking windowpanes to get hold of the man they accused of sacrilege of the Holy Quran. 
Police picked up a sanitary worker. A case was registered under sections 295-B and 34 of PPC on the complaint of Bilal, son of Bundo Khan Abbasi.  
The complainant claimed he had learnt that someone had burnt pages of Holy Quran in Rabi Plaza. He went inside and learnt that someone had burnt Holy Quran. Soon, he said, eight to 10 persons entered the plaza. 
Bilal claimed that Maulana Amin Zikriya showed him burnt pages near an elevator. He asked a sanitary worker whether he knew the identity of the man who had done this, but he remained silent.  
According to Bilal, he got hold of a sanitary worker and took possession of some of the burnt pages. He then handed over the man, along with the burnt pages, to police.  
The trouble started when news about the alleged sacrilege spread like wildlife acr­oss city. All business and commercial centres were shut immediately. Enraged youth gathered outside the plaza. 
The number of furious protesters kept increasing and by 5pm they were in the thousands, blocking streets leading to the plaza. 
As the mob refused to disperse, police decided to disperse the crowd by resorting to tear gas shelling. This forced the protesters to flee the area, but they re-emer­ged after a few minutes.  
Six or seven demonstrators managed to enter the plaza through a mezzanine office by breaking windowpanes and using a ladder.

6,Pemra borrows from old playbook to ban Imran’s live speeches,"After Altaf, Nawaz and Maryam, PTI chief becomes fourth major leader to face restricted media coverage...","ISLAMABAD: PTI chairman Imran Khan has become the fourth mainstream political leader to have faced restricted media coverage, with MQM founder Altaf Hussain, PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz already gone through or suffering a similar fate.
However, in banning Mr Khan’s live speeches on electronic media, the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) took a leaf out of its old playbook that it had used previously against the other three leaders, applying the same court orders and the section of the Pemra Ordinance, 2002.
Section 20 of the Pemra Ordinance, 2002, used to ban Mr Khan’s speeches on electronic media, was previously used by the regulator against Ms Maryam in 2019, when the PTI was in power.
The Pemra’s order against the former premier has reproduced the transcript of his speech made at Islamabad’s F-9 Park on Friday  evening.

After Altaf, Nawaz and Maryam, PTI chief becomes fourth major leader to face restricted media coverage

It had been observed that Mr Khan was continuously levelling “baseless allegations” and “spreading hate speech” through his “provocative statements” against state institutions and officers in his speeches, the order stated.
The regulator highlighted that the PTI chief’s speech contained “hateful, slanderous and unwarranted” statements against state institutions and officers, violating Article 19 of the Constitution, titled “Freedom of Speech, etc”.
The regulator also referred to past court orders used to ban speeches of the three leaders.
On July 6, 2019, Pemra had barred the TV channels from airing “unedited live telecast” of Ms Maryam’s press conference in Lahore, alleging that she was maligning the judiciary.
The regulator said the speech violated its ordinance’s Section 20, which stipulated the terms and conditions for licenced TV channels, including ensuring “preservation of the sovereignty, security and integrity of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan”, of “national, cultural, social and religious values and principles of public policy as enshrined in the Constitution”, etc.
Pemra said at the time that Ms Maryam in her press conference expressed contempt for Supreme Court orders passed on Sept 12, 2018 in a suo motu case.
Now, the regulator has used the same order as a pretext to ban Mr Khan’s live speeches.
In October 2020, Pemra had barred channels from airing speeches, interviews and public addresses by absconders and proclaimed offenders — a directive aimed at PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, who had left for London a year ago.
The order came after the three-time former premier slammed the government in a party meeting, which was aired on numerous news channels. Mr Sharif was also accused of instigating the public against state institutions and maligning the judiciary.
The then information minister, Shibli Faraz, at the time said that Mr Sharif had become “another Altaf Hussain”.
Mr Faraz alleged that Mr Sharif’s speeches were provocative and said the law could not be applied differently for Mr Sharif when Altaf Hussain’s speeches were not allowed to be aired.
Mr Hussain was the first among the four political leaders to be banned or restricted from electronic media.
In Sept 2015, the Lahore High Court not only banned the broadcast of Mr Hussai’s speeches but also restricted electronic and print media from running his images.
‘Capping thought process’
The Pemra’s action to bar channels from airing the PTI chief’s live speeches has been criticised even by political opponents.
“Banishing completely a political leader from the media is not the best policy even if laws can be stretched to do so and even if it was done in the past. It didn’t work in the past, is unlikely to work now. It risks making someone bigger than life unwittingly and undeservingly,” PPP leader Farhatullah Babar tweeted on Sunday.
Civil rights activist and advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir said that these moves against political leaders were unfair. “From Altaf Hussain, Nawaz or Maryam to Imran Khan, any political reaction should not be banned,” she told Dawn.
Such restrictions were equal to capping the thought process, she said, adding that there had to be an appropriate reply and counternarrative to counter the rhetoric of political leaders [instead of banning their speeches].
