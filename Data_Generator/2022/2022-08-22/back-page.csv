0,Power companies seek extra Rs64bn next month,"If cost adjustment is approved, users will pay additional Rs4.69 per unit in September.","ISLAMABAD: The power distribution companies (Discos) have sought an additional fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs4.69 per unit to generate about another Rs64 billion in revenue on account of the higher cost of electricity consumed in July.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has accepted the tariff petition for a public hearing fixed for Aug 31. The additional FCA demanded by Discos, previously managed by Wapda, for July is almost 53 per cent lower than that of a record Rs9.9 per unit for June because of a substantial increase in the share of cheaper domestic fuels, particularly low-cost sources like hydropower and nuclear power.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) — a subsidiary of the power division — sought the Rs4.69 monthly FCA on behalf of Discos for electricity sold to consumers in July. This will generate about Rs65bn in additional funds to Discos in the billing month of September. The extra cost adjustment is almost 75pc higher than the reference fuel cost charged by the power supply companies in July.
Data showed that about 64pc power generation came in July from cheaper domestic resources with static prices compared to a 51pc share in June. The share was 54pc in May, 50pc in April and 45pc in March.

If cost adjustment is approved, users will pay additional Rs4.69 per unit in September

The biggest contribution to the overall power grid came from hydropower, which has no fuel cost. Its share jumped to 35pc in July from 24pc in June and May.
Besides, the lower availability of imported and thus expensive RLNG, or regasified liquefied natural gas, came as a blessing in disguise for consumers.
The CPPA claimed that consumers were charged a reference fuel cost of Rs6.29 per unit in July, but the actual price turned out to be Rs10.98 per unit, hence an additional charge of about Rs4.69 per unit.
This extra rate, once approved, would be charged to all consumers in September, except to those using fewer than 50 units per month.
After hydropower, the second-biggest contribution of about 15pc in the overall power supply in July came from power plants running on imported RLNG; the percentage was significantly lower than 24.43pc in June and 23pc in May.
With the revival of the 1,100-megawatt K-2 nuclear power plant after a month-long closure for refuelling, the share of nuclear power also increased to 14.2pc in July from 9pc in June. Nuclear power had a 13pc share in May and 17.4pc in April.
The share of coal-based power plants was slightly lower at 12.7pc in July compared to 13.6pc in June and May. Coal-based electricity generation has come down from 16.7pc in April and 25pc in March because of low coal stocks amid the financial limitations of power producers and higher global prices.
In January and February, coal-based generation contributed 33pc and 32pc to the overall power generation.
The share of domestic gas in power generation stood almost unchanged at 10.4pc in July against 11pc in June and 10pc in May and April.
The share of power generated by the residual fuel oil stood at 6.2pc in July, significantly lower than 10.5pc in June thanks to higher production from nuclear and hydropower sources.
The cost of power generation from domestic gas rose to Rs9.96 per unit in July from Rs8.9 in June but was still lower than Rs10.12 per unit in May. The cost was Rs8.4 per unit in April and Rs7.75 per unit in March.
Three renewable energy sources — wind, bagasse and solar — together contributed about 4.45pc to July’s power generation compared to 7pc in June and 6.5pc in May. Wind and solar have no fuel cost, while that of bagasse was calculated at an unchanged Rs5.98 per unit.
The most expensive power generation — i.e. Rs35.7 per unit — in July came from plants running on furnace oil, slightly lower than Rs36.2 in June but higher than Rs33.67 in May, Rs28.2 in April and Rs22.52 in March.
The CPPA said a total of 14,151 gigawatt-hours (GWh) was generated in July at the cost of Rs151.55bn at the rate of Rs10.71 per unit, whereas net units delivered to Discos stood at 13,760 Gwh, costing Rs151.13bn at the rate of Rs10.98 per unit.

1,Pakistan rejects India’s false terror-related claims,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Sunday firmly rejected the recent spate of false terrorism-related assertions made by India ...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Sunday firmly rejected the recent spate of false terrorism-related assertions made by India in which some detached alleged incidents are being distorted and presented as a so-called ‘terror’ plot against India. 
A statement issued by the Foreign Office said that in order to build on this orchestrated ‘terrorism’ narrative against Pakistan, a section of the Indian media had reported that India had intercepted a message from a ‘Pakistani’ WhatsApp number as well as seized an ‘empty boat’ in Maharashtra along with some weapons. 
It said that segments of the Indian media had deceitfully sought to link these to the preposterous claims about a so-called ‘Mumbai-style’ attack being planned. 
Separately, the Indian media have also reported that the Indian intelligence and border forces were on high alert for possible ‘cross-border infiltration’ attempts along Rajauri. 
“All this is nothing but continuation of the sinister Indian design to yet again raise the ‘terrorism’ bogey to malign Pakistan. We reject these allegations and Indian machinations outrightly,” the statement said. 
The FO said that possibility of a choreographed ‘false flag activity’ to target Pakistan and negatively affect its political and economic interests cannot be ruled out, as Indian propaganda is pointing in that direction. 
“India must recognise that no amount of false propaganda can deter Pakistan from exposing India’s brutalisation of the Kashmiri people,” the statement said. 
“Pakistan also urges the international community to take immediate cognizance of the fact that India is yet again resorting to classic ‘false flag’ methods to advance its sinister designs,” it added.

2,Schools closed in Balochistan as rains claim nine more lives,"NDMA forecasts more rains, flash flooding; PM asks army chief for helicopters to speed up relief operations.","QUETTA: The death and destruction in Balochistan continued on Sunday as nine more people lost their lives in rain-related accidents. The provincial government has closed all education institutions in light of a renewed warning of downpour and flash floods. 
As major highways connecting to the province were still cut off, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has requested Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to provide helicopters to reach the people who were stranded due to washing away of roads and highways. 
Quetta received heavy downpour on Sunday, resulting in urban flooding in Pashtoonabad, Hazara Town, Qadirand, Aminabd, Nawan Killi, Killi Qambrani and Sariab areas, where floodwater entered several houses. Karkhasa Dam near Quetta was breached at one point due to hill torrents, inundating several areas near Western Bypass. 
Quetta Commissioner Sohailur Rehman Baloch said the dam’s spillways have been opened by the irrigation department after it was filled to maximum capacity. 

NDMA forecasts more rains, flash flooding; PM asks army chief for helicopters to speed up relief operations

Following the forecast of more rains and flooding, the Balochistan government has closed all educational institutions for one week. A notification issued by the provincial government stated that all government and private schools, colleges and other educational institutions would remain closed from Aug 22 to 27. 
However, more areas were expected to come under water as the NDMA has issued a fresh warning of flash floods in eastern parts of Balochistan, APP reported. 
According to the NDMA advisory, the Flood Forecasting Division has forecast moderate flash flooding in the rivers and nullahs of eastern Balochistan during the next 24 hours and subsequent heavy flooding. 
The advisory also forecast “medium to high-level flooding” in Kabul River at Nowshera and Indus River till Monday (today). 
NHA advisory for travellers 
As major Balochistan highways were still inundated, the National Highway Authority (NHA) issued an advisory for people to avoid travel on these roads. The advisory issued by the NHA spokesperson stated that Karachi-Quetta National Highway (N-25) was completely closed for traffic as Linda Bridge at Lasbela was washed away by flash floods. 
Separately, Ratodero-Gwadar Motorway (M-8) was closed at Wangu Hills in Khuzdar. Traffic was also suspended on Dera Ismail Khan-Quetta National Highway (N-50) from Zhob-Dhanasar sentient, while Qilla Saifullah-Multan National Highway (N-70) was closed at Fort Munro. 
Meanwhile, Balochistan’s rail link with other areas could not be restored even a week after major railway lines were washed away. 
A train that was scheduled to leave Quetta for Karachi was cancelled as the track was not cleared by the authorities due to floodwater, official sources told Dawn, adding that the track was also inundated in some areas of Sindh.
PM calls COAS, NDMA chairman 
PM Shehbaz on Sunday called the army chief and National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Akhtar Nawaz to review rescue, relief and rehabilitation operations in the flood-affected areas, a statement released by the Prime Minister Office said 
During the telephonic conversation, the prime minister and the army chief discussed the flood situation and rehabilitation operations, especially in Sindh. The prime minister appreciated the army’s cooperation in rescue and relief operations, the statement added. 
The NDMA chairman apprised the prime minister of the latest flood situation and the authority’s rescue and relief operations in Balochistan and Sindh.
The prime minister also directed the Benazir Income Support Programme to immediately distribute compensation money among the flood victims of Sindh.
Humanitarian assistance 
Pakistan Air Force is also assisting the local authorities by providing “humanitarian assistance and disaster relief support” to the people stranded in Balochistan and Sindh, a statement issued by the PAF spokesperson said. 
PAF’s Emergency Response teams were providing rations to the people on the instructions of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, the statement added.

3,Dock workers latest to join UK strikes,Strike comes amid stoppages over pay and working conditions across various UK industries.,"LONDON: Workers at Britain’s biggest container port, Felixstowe, on Sunday began an eight-day strike over pay, in the latest industrial action as decades-high inflation intensifies the country’s cost-of-living crisis. 
Nearly 2,000 unionised employees at the port in eastern England, including crane drivers, machine operators and stevedores, started their walkout on Sunday morning in the first strike at Felixstowe since 1989. 
It comes amid stoppages over pay and working conditions across various UK industries, with railway workers just the latest to strike on Thursday and Saturday this week. 
Postal workers plan a four-day strike later this month, Telecoms giant BT will face its first stoppage in decades while Amazon warehouse staff, criminal lawyers and refuse collectors are among the others staging walkouts. 

PM hopeful Liz Truss downplays prospect of recession

Pay hike demands are driven by inflation, which hit a 40-year-high above 10 per cent last month, as soaring food and energy prices hurt millions. 
The Unite union representing the striking Felixstowe staff said the stoppage will have a big impact at the port, which handles around four million containers a year from 2,000 ships. 
The union wants pay rises for its members at or near inflation, arguing the docks are “enormously profitable”. 
“They can give Felixstowe workers a decent pay raise,” said Unite general secretary Sharon Graham, who added that parent company, CK Hutchison Holding Ltd, handed out nearly 100 million ($121m) to shareholders in 2020. 
The Port of Felixstowe said in a statement that it was “disappointed” the walkout had gone ahead and called its offer of salary increases of on average 8pe “fair”. 
Recession
Tory leadership favourite Liz Truss downplayed on Sunday the prospect of a UK recession, while the man tipped to be her finance minister vowed “help is coming” over the soaring cost of living. 
Truss, the frontrunner in polls to beat rival Rishi Sunak and become Britain’s next prime minister, pledged in an interview to lead a “small business and self-employed revolution” if in power. 
“There is too much talk that there’s going to be a recession,” Truss told The Sun on Sunday tabloid. 
“I don’t believe that’s inevitable. We can unleash opportunity here in Britain.” She argued that the UK should create the economic conditions to produce “the next Google or the next Facebook”. 
“It’s about that level of ambition,” Truss added.

4,Daughter of ‘Putin’s brain’ killed in car bombing,"MOSCOW: The daughter of Alexander Dugin, a hardline Russian ideologue close to President Vladimir Putin, has been...","MOSCOW: The daughter of Alexander Dugin, a hardline Russian ideologue close to President Vladimir Putin, has been killed in a car bombing on Moscow’s outskirts, authorities said on Sunday. 
According to family members quoted by Russian media, Dugin — a vocal supporter of Kremlin’s offensive in Ukraine — was the likely target of the blast as his daughter borrowed his car at the last minute. 
Daria Dugina was killed when a bomb placed in the Toyota Land Cruiser went off as she drove on a highway near the village of Bolshie Vyzyomy, some 40 kilometres outside Moscow, Russia’s Investigative Committee said in a statement. 
Dugina, a journalist born in 1992 who herself openly supported the offensive, died on the scene and a homicide investigation has been opened, said the committee, which probes major crime cases in Russia. 
In July, Britain put her on a list of sanctioned Russians for allegedly spreading online disinformation about Ukraine. 
Dugin, 60, sometimes called “Putin’s Rasputin” or “Putin’s brain,” is an outspoken Russian ultranationalist intellectual. 
He has long advocated the unification of Russian-speaking territories in a vast new Russian empire and wholeheartedly supported Moscow’s operation in Ukraine.
He was put on a Western sanctions list after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, a move he also backed. 
Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram that “if the Ukrainian theory is confirmed... and it must be verified by competent authorities, it will amount to state terrorism on the part of the Kyiv regime”.

5,Obituary: Nayyara Noor — the self-effacing nightingale,Noor — who gained the honorific title of Bublbul-i-Pakistan — was the recipient of the President’s Pride of Performance award.,"TO say that music lovers received a shock on Saturday night to know that singer par excellence Nayyara Noor had passed away in Karachi would be an understatement. Yes, she was 71 years of age. Yes, she hadn’t been feeling well for the last few weeks. But death of an artist of her stature is extremely hard to come to terms with. What also endeared her to admirers was that she was an unassuming person who never took her fame and recognition seriously. As a video clip that’s circulating on social media suggests, she never ‘claimed’ her achievements because she always felt happy to ‘share’ works of art with people. 
Noor was born on Nov 3, 1950 in Guwahati in Indian state of Assam where her family had shifted from Amritsar. According to one account, her businessman father was an active member of the Muslim League and when Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah visited Guwahati he stayed at their residence. Her mother along with her children immigrated to Karachi in 1957 while the father stayed back to look after their property. He arrived in Pakistan in the early 1990s. 
It was in Lahore where Noor was a student at the National College of Arts (NCA) that her singing ability came to the fore. She hadn’t acquired any formal training in music. As a teenager, she used to listen to eminent vocalists such as Begum Akhtar, Lata Mangeshkar and Kanan Devi. Her gift was natural. Once recognised, she, like a student who had developed unwavering focus, worked diligently to polish her art. Her understanding of the sanctity of words, too, came in handy. Most of all, it was her unique voice that won many a heart. She used its nasality to her advantage by never compromising on the subtleties of compositions. 
Noor began her career from Radio Pakistan, graduated to television and then playback singing for films. She shot into national prominence when she appeared in Shoaib Hashmi’s TV shows Taal Matol and Sach Gup and her initial job for the silver screen included the movies Gharana and Tansen. The song Ruthey ho tum tum ko kaisey manaon piya that she sang for the film Aina (1977) is one of the most popular tracks ever recorded in the history of Pakistani films. 
What distinguished Noor from her contemporaries, and perhaps from a couple of her illustrious predecessors, was the ease and facility with which she sang Urdu poetry. Ghazal singing had been in vogue for decades, and she was brilliant at that — Behzad Lackhnavi’s Ay jazba-i-dil gar main chahun is a prime example — but it was her rendition of nazms written in free verse that carved a niche for her in the world of music. The poem Kabhi hum khubsurat thay used as the soundtrack for a TV serial Teesra Kinara in the late 1970s is loved to date and sung by modern-day vocalists. 
In that context, her collaboration with composer Arshad Mahmud cannot be under-emphasised. He set Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s iconic poems to music and gave them to Noor to sing. Both the words and the tunes could intimidate a lesser singer, not Noor. She had a consuming passion for singing and poetry in equal measure. As a result, music and literature buffs were treated to masterpieces such as Aaj bazaar mein pabijonla chalo and Merey qaatil merey dildaar merey paas raho.
Her voice also lent a distinct flavour to the patr­iotic number Watan ki mitti gavah rehna as well. 
When Arshad Mahmud was contacted by Dawn for his comments on Noor, he was in tears. He couldn’t speak properly and only managed to say that his association with her went back to 60 years. He had been listening to the poem Ayey arz guzarein ke nigar-i-hasti sung by her ever since he came to know about her demise. 
Noor — who gained the honorific title of Bublbul-i-Pakistan (Pakistan’s nightingale) — was the recipient of the President’s Pride of Performance award. 
Her funeral prayers were held on Sunday at Imam Bargah Yasrab, DHA Phase IV. She is survived by her husband and two sons. 
Meanwhile, President Dr Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed their grief over death of Nayyara Noor, APP reported.
