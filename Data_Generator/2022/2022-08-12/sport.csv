Cricket Australia said US$30,000 would be donated as a gesture of support, after the men’s squad witnessed long fuel queues and political demonstrations during the mid-year tour.
Soaring inflation and widespread fuel shortages have made life tough for millions of Sri Lankans.
The United Nations has declared a humanitarian crisis and widespread protests led to the ouster of the country’s president and prime minister.
The visiting Australians saw the crisis first-hand.
“It was very clear to us how much day-to-day life for Sri Lankans is being impacted,” captain Pat Cummins said.
The money will go to UN children’s aid agency UNICEF.

1,Shakib cancels deal with betting site after BCB ultimatum,DHAKA: Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan on Thursday cancelled an endorsement deal with a betting site hours...,"DHAKA: Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan on Thursday cancelled an endorsement deal with a betting site hours after the Bangladesh Cricket Board issued an ultimatum to him to either ditch it or face the axe by the national team.
“Shakib gave a letter to us saying that he was terminating his contract with Betwinner news and removing all posts from his social media pages regarding the deal,” BCB cricket operations chief Jalal Yunus told AFP.
Shakib last week announced a partnership with Betwinner news, a portal operated by the gambling firm based on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao.
He wrote on his social media pages that it was the  “one and only source of sports news!” All forms of gambling are illegal in Bangladesh — although it is rampant during cricket matches when underground punters exploit a brief delay between live play and official broadcasts — and cricket administrators were quick to seek an explanation from the player.
BCB president Nazmul Hassan on Thursday said they had asked Shakib to choose between the national team and Betwinner and the issue was non-negotiable.
“There is no question of second thoughts,” he told reporters.  “He has to come out of this, otherwise, he will not be in the squad,” Nazmul said in Dhaka.
Shakib had been widely expected to take over the Bangladesh Twenty20 side as captain for the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE and lead the side to the next Twenty20 World Cup in Australia in October and November.
But the captaincy was not even a subject for discussion unless he cancelled the Betwinner deal, Nazmul added.
“He won’t even be in the team. There is no scope for negotiation. We are clear about this,” he said.
The announcement of the Asia Cup squad has been delayed for a day pending Shakib’s decision, he added.
The International Cricket Council banned the all-rounder for two years — one of them suspended — in 2019 after he failed to record corrupt approaches.
Bangladesh reappointed Shakib as Test captain in June following the resignation of Mominul Haque.

2,Players prioritising T20 leagues hardly a Boult from the blue,Trent Boult giving up his New Zealand Cricket contract is another sign of a revolution sweeping through the game.,"NEW DELHI: Trent Boult giving up his New Zealand Cricket contract is another sign of a revolution sweeping through the game — a change happening not at the leisurely pace of a Test match but at the breakneck speed of a Twenty20 innings.
A key figure in the teams that won the inaugural World Test Championship and finished runners-up in three limited overs World Cups, Boult will from now on have a  “significantly reduced role” with the Black Caps.
The left-arm quick requested the release from his contract so he could spend more time with his young family but, a New Zealand Cricket (NZC) statement said, the 33-year-old also wanted to make himself available for  “domestic leagues”.
A crammed international calendar in three formats of the game and the added strain of playing in biosecure bubbles during the Covid-19 pandemic have pushed players like Boult to breaking point.
England talisman Ben Stokes quit the 50-overs format last month citing an  “unsustainable” workload, while South Africa’s Quinton de Kock dropped Test cricket last year.
All three have, however, found time to play in the Indian Premier League (IPL), the trailblazer of the lucrative Twenty20  “domestic leagues” now proliferating around the world.
“The decisions that Quinton de Kock, and specifically Trent Boult, have made, point to a future of shorter international careers and more players happy to be part of the gig economy,” tweeted commentator Harsha Bhogle. “With young families, it isn’t easy to play both, international cricket and T20 leagues.”
Mushrooming franchise cricket, including upcoming leagues in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa, is making it an easy choice for some players.
Bhogle said it would be unfair to criticise players who prioritise franchise cricket for  “greed and opportunism”.
“Do remember cricketers finish their playing careers when most others are entering their best phase,” he added.  “And we change jobs that offer more money and convenience, no?”
Several West Indies players have effectively turned into Twenty20 freelancers, earning lot more from franchise cricket than they could have playing international cricket.
The uncertainty around the availability of their key players has frustrated West Indies chief coach Phil Simmons ahead of this year’s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.
“It hurts. There’s no other way to put it,” an exasperated Simmons said on Wednesday. “But what can you do? I don’t think that I should be begging people to play for their countries.”
NZC chief executive David White ruled out more New Zealand cricketers following Boult’s example.
“They are still talking about Test cricket — and performing for New Zealand — as being incredibly important,” White told Cricinfo website.
“The other thing is that if you are going to get a big offer from a big league, you’ve got to be a successful international cricketer.”
The International Cricket Council discussed the growth of T20 leagues in its annual general meeting in Birmingham last month but anyone looking to them for leadership might be disappointed.
The governing body has put the onus on the member boards to find balance between domestic and bilateral cricket to better manage the workload of players.

3,Champions Real ready to frustrate Barca’s all-star line-up,MADRID: European champions Real Madrid will begin their LaLiga title defence against promoted Almeria on Sunday but...,"MADRID: European champions Real Madrid will begin their LaLiga title defence against promoted Almeria on Sunday but they will be under no illusion that the biggest obstacle in their pursuit of a 36th title will be a revamped and hungry Barcelona side.
Real completed the double last season by claiming a record-extending 35th LaLiga title before conquering Europe too, winning a record-extending 14th Champions League title.
Carlo Ancelotti will be relying on almost the same group of victorious players to leave their mark on this season. The additions of former Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger as a free-agent and France midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni from Monaco for a fee that could rise up to 100 million euros will further strengthen the squad.
With 34-year-old French striker Karim Benzema and 22-year-old Brazilian winger Vinicius Jr forming a potent duo up front, Real have a fine mix of youth and experience to tackle the toughest challenges, such as in their amazing run of comebacks against Paris St Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City in last year’s Champions League.
Determined to end their three-year LaLiga title drought, Barcelona were Europe’s biggest spenders in the close season as they splashed out around 150 million euros ($155.21 million) to assemble an all-star team, signing Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich, Brazil winger Raphinha from Leeds United and defender Jules Kounde from Sevilla.
However, due to a deep financial crisis exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and, restricted by LaLiga’s Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, Barca are still unable to register their new players ahead of the season opener on Saturday against Rayo Vallecano.
Barca are running against the clock trying to activate a final financial lever, along with their attempt to sell Dutch midfielder Frenkie de Jong which would enable them to get the green light from LaLiga for their new signings.
Their deadline is the end of the transfer window on Aug 31.
Diego Simeone’s Atletico Madrid will also want to consider themselves among the title contenders following their triumphant run to the title in 2021.
But they kept a low-profile during the close season, with the priority being to ensure they did not lose any of their key players in the build-up to their opening match against Getafe on Monday.
They extended goalkeeper Jan Oblak’s contract until 2028 and France international midfielder Thomas Lemar’s until 2027, and signed fullback Nahuel Molina from Udinese.
Forward Alvaro Morata is back after spending a season on loan at Juventus and he will add some much needed firepower to Atletico up-front, alongside Antoine Griezmann and Joao Felix.
Julen Lopetegui’s Sevilla, who kick off their campaign against Osasuna on Friday, signed playmaker Isco Alarcon as a free agent after his contract with Real Madrid expired at the end of last season. Along with Champions League semi-finalists Villarreal, they will be eager to challenge the top-three’s dominance in the league.

6,Taylor recalls racial ‘insensitivity’ in NZ cricket,WELLINGTON: Retired batsman Ross Taylor has revealed he was offended by race-based remarks from team- mates and ...,"WELLINGTON: Retired batsman Ross Taylor has revealed he was offended by race-based remarks from team- mates and staff in New Zealand dressing rooms during his career and said the country’s cricket board could do more to bring Polynesian talent into the sport. 
Taylor, who has Samoan heritage on his mother’s side, described in his book “Ross Taylor Black and White” how he and other team-mates endured insensitive “banter” from white players. 
Taylor said that for most of his career he was “an anomaly, a brown face in a vanilla line-up”. 
“In many ways, dressing room banter is the barometer,” wrote Taylor, who played his last international match in April. “A team-mate used to tell me, ‘You’re half a good guy, Ross, but which half is good? You don’t know what I’m referring to.’ 
“I was pretty sure I did. Other players also had to put up with comments that dwelt on their ethnicity. In all probability, a Pakeha [white New Zealander] listening to those sorts of comments would think, ‘Oh, that’s okay, it’s just a bit of banter’. 
“But he’s hearing it as white person, and it’s not directed at people like him. So, there’s no pushback; no one corrects them.” 
Taylor, New Zealand’s most prolific Test batsman with 7,683 runs, said the episodes left him feeling conflicted. 
“You wonder if you should pull them up but worry that you’ll create a bigger problem or be accused of playing the race card by inflating harmless banter into racism,” the 38-year-old said. “It’s easier to develop a thick skin and let it slide, but is that the right thing to do?” 
He said former staff members had made clumsy comments that “landed with a thud”. 
“Let me be clear: I don’t think for one minute that they were coming from a racist perspective,” he said. “I think they were insensitive and lacked the imagination and empathy to put themselves in the other person’s shoes. 
“Instead of the message being, ‘You’re one of us, mate,’ it is, in effect, ‘You’re one of them’.” 
More than 8% of New Zealand’s population identify as being of Pacific origin but Taylor is one of only a few Pasifika cricketers to reach the highest level in the country. 
Elite rugby in New Zealand, however, is laden with talent from the Pasifika community. 
Taylor said some Polynesian parents might be put off by the cost of cricket gear. 
“But maybe New Zealand Cricket should be putting more resources into the Polynesian community because there must be more where I came from,” he wrote. 
A spokesman for 
New Zealand Cricket told said they have contacted Taylor about the allegations. 
“NZC has reached out to Ross to discuss some of the comments in his book, both to better understand the details of them and to offer support. These discussions are ongoing,” said the spokesman. 
“Ross currently sits on an NZC working group seeking to improve the game’s engagement with Pasifika communities and his input is greatly valued. 
“We consider him an important part of our cricket family and are deeply disappointed he’s been exposed to this type of behaviour. NZC deplores racism.”

7,Babar defends team selection ahead of Netherlands tour,Says Pakistan will need their players in the upcoming three-match One-day International series against the Netherlands.,"LAHORE: Pakistan will need their best players in the upcoming three-match One-day International series against the Netherlands which will be played as part of the ICC World Cup Super League, skipper Babar Azam has said.
The national side’s selection for the games, set to be played from August 16-18, was criticised due to the absence of any emerging players in the squad which will face a fairly inexperienced Netherlands side.
Babar believed Pakistan were going into the series with what he believed was the best combination of players who have been picked after his thorough consultation with the chief selector and the head coach. 
“There was no need to include a lot of junior players considering the Netherlands as a weak side,” said Babar during a press conference at the Gaddafi Stadium here on Thursday. 
“The series carries valuable [Super League] points and can help Pakistan consolidate their position to qualify for the World Cup,” said the batter.
Pakistan are currently placed fifth in the Super League standings. The top eight teams directly qualify for the 50-over showpiece which is to be staged in India next year.
While Pakistan have retained most of their main players, pacer Hasan Ali has been dropped after consistently failing to impress despite having Babar’s back throughout the difficult period.
Fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi’s injury during the recently concluded Test series against Sri Lanka has left Pakistan without a pace spearhead. Shaheen, though, will travel with the squad to the Netherlands where “he will continue his rehab under the guidance of the team doctors,” said Babar.
The captain, however, said Hasan needed to play the upcoming domestic season to prove himself worthy of Pakistan selection again adding that he trusted the bowling bench strength in the likes of Naseem Shah, Mohammad Wasim Jr and Shahnawaz Dahani to deliver the goods in the absence of the senior pacers.
Hasan, who has a Twenty20 International economy rate of over eight runs per over, has also been left out of the Pakistan squad for the T20 Asia Cup, which is set to be played from August 27 in the United Arab Emirates.
Another player absent from the Asia Cup squad is veteran all-rounder Shoaib Malik, who was key in Pakistan’s run to the semi-finals in last years T20 World Cup at the same venue.
Malik was a last-minute inclusion for the T20 showpiece. Babar ruled out the possibility of something similar happening again.
“We have announced the team considering it as the best and I think there is no time to make any more changes,” said the 27-year-old.
Babar said Pakistan depended on all players to show up with performances when the team needed it and that they did not rely on one or two of them to be the match-winners every time. 
“Everyone has seen the way Shadab Khan, [Mohammad] Nawaz, Asif Ali, Mohammad Rizwan, Fakhar Zaman, Imam-ul-Haq, Khushdil Shah and others have single-handedly turned the match in Pakistan’s favour by giving match-winning individual performances, so I consider all as trump cards,” he said.

8,Morocco fire coach Halilhodzic three months before World Cup kick-off,CASABLANCA: Morocco has fired its football coach Vahid Halilhodzic just three months before the country competes in...,"CASABLANCA: Morocco has fired its football coach Vahid Halilhodzic just three months before the country competes in the World Cup finals in Qatar. 
The announcement by the Moroccan football federation on Thursday ends months of speculation over the fate of the Franco-Bosnian coach, who has now suffered the extraordinary feat of being fired three times by national teams after they qualified for World Cup finals. 
“Given the differences and divergent visions between the Royal Moroccan Football Federation and national coach Vahid Halilhodzic on the best way to prepare the national football team for the Qatar 2022 World Cup, the two parties decided to separate,” the federation said in a statement. 
Halilhodzic’s possible departure had been the cause of much speculation since Morocco’s tepid showing at the Africa Cup of Nations finals in January and, in particular, his handling of two of his star players. 
He sidelined Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech and Noussair Mazraoui of Ajax for disciplinary reasons and qualified for the World Cup without them but it seems the federation wanted them back. 
Neither Ziyech and Mazraoui were part of the squad that reached the quarter-finals of the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon in January and Halilhodzic omitted both from the World Cup qualifying play-off matches against the Democratic Republic of Congo in March. 
Federation president Fouzi Lekjaa has been pressing for a return of Dutch-born midfielder Ziyech amid a public outcry at his absence, putting him at odds with his coach, who was appointed to the Morocco job three years ago. 
Halilhodzic’s brusque manner was cited as the reason for Japan firing him after he had qualified them for the last World Cup in Russia. He was dismissed just two months before the 2018 finals with the Japanese Football Association citing “communication” problems and claiming he had lost the trust of his players. 
Halilhodzic, who played for Yugoslavia at the 1982 World Cup and was later a successful striker in France, was also dismissed by the Ivory Coast ahead of the 2010 finals in South Africa and replaced by Sven Goran Eriksson. That came after the Ivorians had fared poorly at the Cup of Nations finals some six months before the World Cup. 
He did take Algeria to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, where they came close to an upset victory over Germany in the last 16. 
Morocco is expected to name its former international Walid Regragui as its new coach. He led Wydad Casablanca to the African Champions League crown in May. 
The World Cup starts November 20 in Qatar where Morocco take on Croatia, Belgium and Canada in Group ‘F’.

Shan was not happy to play for the Shaheens and wanted to be included in the senior team, Dawn has learnt. The left-hander, who has been enjoying an immense run of form since last year, was in contention for the Netherlands tour as his passport was sought for visa processing.
However, being asked to play for the Shaheens instead of Pakistan might have displeased him as he left the camp to play county cricket in England, sources said.
Young opener Abdullah Shafique’s consistent performances for the Pakistan Test side since the opener made his debut against Bangladesh this year is said to have pushed Shan, 32, out of favour.
Shan, however, has been ignored despite amassing hundreds of runs across all three formats. After finding his form in the 2021-22 Quaid-e-Azam, in which he averaged 71.71, Shan was third in the batting charts of the 2022 Pakistan Super League, hitting 478 run in 12 outings for runners-up Multan Sultans.
The left-hander is also the fourth-highest run-scorer in the ongoing County Championship with over a thousand runs in eight matches.

10,Santner stars as New Zealand beat West Indies in T20 series opener,KINGSTON: West Indies’ season of white ball woe continued on Wednesday when New Zealand completed a 13-run win in...,"KINGSTON: West Indies’ season of white ball woe continued on Wednesday when New Zealand completed a 13-run win in the first T20 International of a three-match series at Sabina Park in Jamaica. 
Fresh from a successful European sojourn, the Black Caps posted a formidable 185 for five batting first in a rain-interrupted innings before their premier bowlers combined to limit the Caribbean side to 172 for seven in reply. 
Since getting the better of Bangladesh 2-0 in a T20I duel, the West Indies have been swept 3-0 by the Bangladeshis and India in successive One-Day International series before going down 4-1 to the Indians in another T20I campaign immediately preceding this assignment. 
New Zealand almost paid for a period of complacency towards the end of the match as an explosive unbroken 58-run eighth-wicket partnership between Romario Shepherd (31 not out) and Odean Smith (27 not out) gave the hosts a glimmer of hope after they had crashed to 114 for seven in the 16th over. 
But they were left with too much to do as “Man of the Match” Mitchell Santner’s haul of three for 19 ripped the heart of the West Indies batting as he claimed the wickets of captain Nicholas Pooran first ball before adding Shimron Hetmyer and top-scorer Shamarh Brooks (42) to his list of victims. 
“It was a bit surprising to see as much spin on this deck,” said the left-arm spinner after receiving the award. “Bowling the right lengths is key against these guys because with the power they possess they can smash you away pretty easily.” 
New Zealand were set on their way after being put in to bat with an opening stand of 62 between Devon Conway and Martin Guptill. 
Skipper Kane Williamson’s 47 off 33 balls kept the innings rolling along either side of the rain interruption but it was the late impetus from Jimmy Neesham, who belted an unbeaten 33 off just 15 balls with three fours and two sixes, which pushed the tourists to a target which ultimately proved to be just beyond the reach of the bludgeoning Shepherd and Smith. 
For Smith the match was a personal triumph as his batting effort followed career-best T20I figures of three for 32. 
“Winning or losing can be contagious and the problem is we are losing at the moment,” said a downbeat Pooran in reflecting on yet another setback in the countdown to the World T20 in October in Australia, where the two-time champions will have to get through a qualifying round first.

11,Real defeat Eintracht for record-equalling fifth UEFA Super Cup win,HELSINKI: Champions League winners Real Madrid outclassed Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 on Wednesday to clinch the UEFA...,"HELSINKI: Champions League winners Real Madrid outclassed Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 on Wednesday to clinch the UEFA Super Cup for a record-equalling fifth time and kick off their season with a trophy. 
A first half goal from David Alaba and another from Karim Benzema in the 65th that lifted him to second in Real’s all-time scoring list with 324 goals, wrapped up the title for the Spaniards. 
While Europa League winners Eintracht were dangerous, particularly in the first half, Real’s experience and individual quality saw them through, as it did so often in their victorious 2021-22 Champions League campaign. 
The win brought Real level with AC Milan and Barcelona who have also five Super Cup wins and also means Real’s Carlo Ancelotti becomes the first coach to lift the trophy four times. 
“Eintracht were very closed and we found it difficult to find our rhythm, but we did it well then,” the Real coach said. “It’s difficult at the beginning of the season to be in top form but we now have won to start the season well.” 
The Italian, who had named the same starting 11 that began their winning Champions League final in Paris in May, had special praise for captain Benzema, last season’s top scorer in the Champions League. 
“He’s a very important player, a team leader,” he said. “If we’re here it’s largely due to his merits, he scored a lot of goals, he finished the season well, he scored a goal today and now he’s going for the Ballon d’Or award,” said Ancelotti. 
Eintracht were without playmaker Filip Kostic who is close to a move to Juventus, but looked more disciplined than in their 6-1 loss to Bayern Munich last week in their Bundesliga season opener. 
They also carved out the first chance of the game when Daichi Kamada broke clear but could not beat Real keeper Thibaut Courtois with his low drive in the 14th minute. 
Real responded three minutes later but Vinicius Jr’s effort was cleared on the line by Tuta. Eintracht keeper Kevin Trapp did well to palm another Vinicius Jr effort wide. 
The keeper, however, misjudged a cross in the 37th and was well out of position when Casemiro headed on for Alaba and the Austrian tapped in from close range for the lead. 
Real stayed in control after the break, forcing another good save from Trapp in the 55th, knocking away a deflected Vinicius Jr shot before Casemiro rattled the crossbar with a shot from the edge of the box two minutes later. 
The pressure eventually paid off when Vinicius Jr combined with Benzema — the pair scored a combined 111 club goals last season — and the French forward slotted in to kill off any lingering Eintracht hopes of a first ever Super Cup title. 
Alaba praised his team’s determination to continue their stellar form from last season. 
“We were here to win and to collect the next title... We want to pick up where we left off last season,” Alaba told RTL. “It’s always nice to score goals - it doesn’t happen so often for me.” 
Eintracht captain Sebastian Rode lamented his side’s failures to take their opportunities. 
“Against the Champions League winners you have to take your chances. We didn’t take ours in the decisive moments,” he told broadcaster DAZN. 
The clash, in Helsinki’s Olympic Stadium, was the first time these two sides had met in a European decider since 1960, when Real dismantled Frankfurt 7-3 through four goals to Ferenc Puskas and three to Alfredo di Stefano in the European Cup final. 
The match also highlighted the growing gap between the Champions League and Europa League competitions, with Real being the ninth Champions League team to win the competition in the past 10 years. 
Only city rivals Atletico Madrid have won the Super Cup when qualifying via a Europa League win in the past decade, having done so by beating Real in the 2018 edition.

Fresh from a fifth world title in Eugene, Oregon last month, Fraser-Pryce had produced blistering performances to clock 10.66 at the Silesia Diamond League event on Saturday and 10.67 at the Hungarian Grand Prix two days later. 
She went even quicker in ideal conditions at Monaco’s Stade Louis II to easily break the 10.70 barrier for the sixth time in a stellar season, while Jackson (10.71) and Ta Lou (10.72) also ran personal bests in an absorbing race. 
“I did what I needed to and we had fun and let the clock do the talking... to be able to run 10.60 consistently means a lot. It’s remarkable. It’s hard to keep up the speed at this high level,” the 35-year-old Fraser-Pryce said. 
“I’m in my late thirties and I feel I have more to give. I look forward to do my personal best (10.60) during the rest of the season and run fast.... Now, we break and then we come again. I’m not sure about Lausanne [on Aug. 26] yet.” 
Noah Lyles won his second 200m race of the Diamond League season and broke his own meeting record from 2018 with a superb effort of 19.48. Erriyon Knighton (19.84) and Michael Norman (19.95) ensured a podium sweep for the United States.

Double Olympic and world 1500m champion Faith Kipyegon came agonisingly close to shattering Genzebe Dibaba’s world record of 3:50.07 set in 2015, as she crossed the finish line in 3:50.37 to settle for a Kenyan national record. 
Briton Jake Wightman, who had stunned Jakob Ingebrigtsen in the men’s 1,500m at the worlds last month, continued his winning form in the 1,000m event in 2:13.88 minutes — the fastest time by anyone over the distance in six years. 
The five other world gold medallists on show all produced the goods. 
Two-time Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas won the women’s 400m in 49.28sec while American Grant Holloway claimed victory in 12.99sec in the men’s 110m hurdles despite arriving in Monaco with no luggage, lost en route from a meet in Hungary. 
Australian Kelsey-Lee Barber threw a best of 64.50m to win the women’s javelin, but Venezuela’s Yulimar Rojas made hard work for the triumph in the women’s triple jump, eventually producing a winning effort of 15.01m. 
Qatari Mutaz Barshim, whose gold in Eugene was his third world title, won the high jump.

Serena arrived on the court to a standing ovation and had the full support of the capacity crowd throughout the 77-minute match but was unable to conjure up the old magic that helped her lift three titles in Canada. 
“It’s been a pretty interesting 24 hours ... I’m terrible at goodbyes. But, goodbye Toronto,” an emotional Serena told the crowd. “I always had amazing times here both on and off the court. I’ll be coming back just as a visitor to the city but otherwise its been remarkable.” 
After the match, Serena was presented with team jerseys of Toronto’s NBA and NHL teams for her and her daughter, who was in attendance, as well as a bouquet of flowers that she carried off the court while wiping back tears. 
Prior to the match, a tribute video was played featuring comments from tennis pioneer Billie Jean King, current players like Coco Gauff and Emma Raducanu as well as ice hockey great Wayne Gretzky and highlights of Serena’s Canadian triumphs. 
“It was a lot of emotions obviously,” Serena said about how it felt to take the court. “I love playing here, I’ve always loved playing here. I wish I could’ve played better but Belinda played so well today.” 
Bencic fired eight aces and broke Williams twice in the first set and once in the second, advancing on her first match point after 78 minutes. 
But as Bencic herself said in the post-match interview on court: “Tonight is about her.” 
Up next for Bencic will be Spanish eighth seed Garbine Muguruza, who was a 6-4, 6-4 winner over Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi. 
Serena’s appearance highlighted a day that saw US teenager Coco Gauff overcome 13 double-faults to battle past Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina and into the third round. 
Gauff beat Rybakina 6-4, 6-7 (8-10), 7-6 (7-3) while world number one Iga Swiatek — who beat Gauff in the French Open final this year — sailed past Australian Ajla Tomljanovic 6-1, 6-2 in 55 minutes. 
Among the others reaching the last 16 of the tune-up event for the Aug. 29-Sept. 11 US Open were defending champion Camila Giorgi, Simona Halep, Karolina Pliskova, Jessica Pegula and Aryna Sabalenka. 
KYRGIOS STUNS MEDVEDEV 
At the ATP Montreal Masters, Nick Kyrgios produced a serve-and-volley masterclass to topple world number one Daniil Medvedev 6-7(2-7), 6-4, 6-2 as the top three seeds tumbled in the second round. 
Unseeded American Tommy Paul also came from a set down to send second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz of Spain packing 6-7 (4-7), 7-6 (9-7), 6-3 while unseeded Briton Jack Draper beat third-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece 7-5, 7-6 (7-4). 
Britain’s Dan Evans stunned fifth seed Andrey Rublev 6-4, 6-4 but fourth seed Casper Ruud made it safely through with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-3 victory over the Slovakian Alex Molcan. 
Italian Jannik Sinner needed three sets to get past Adrian Mannarino 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 while Alex de Minaur lined up an all-Aussie match against Kyrgios by defeating Grigor Dimitrov 7-6 (7-4), 7-5. 
Also advancing were Croatia’s Marin Cilic, Frenchman Gael Monfils and Spaniards Roberto Bautista Agut and Pablo Carreno Busta.
