0,Study on serotonin and depression sparks fierce debate,PARIS: A controversy in the scientific community over recent claims anti-depressants can be ineffective at treating...,"PARIS: A controversy in the scientific community over recent claims anti-depressants can be ineffective at treating depression has highlighted the difficulties in understanding mental health conditions.
One of the prevailing theories currently focuses on serotonin. Depression has been linked to a lack of the molecule, which is involved in transmitting emotions to the brain.
Claims that depression has no link to a chemical imbalance in the brain related to serotonin, casting doubt on the need for anti-depressants, have sparked fierce reaction.
A study by psychiatrists Joanna Moncrieff and Mark Horowitz in the journal Molecular Psychiatry in July concluded that there was no proven link between a lack of serotonin and depression.
The authors said it queried the underlying assumption behind the use of anti-depressants, which are mostly developed to alter serotonin levels, undoing a theory that for decades acted as a framework for research.
The study is based on several previous publications, but it quickly attracted criticism — particularly its presentation by Moncrieff, known for her scepticism towards biological explanations of depression and her radical stance against the pharmaceutical industry.
“I’m broadly in agreement with the authors’ conclusions about our current efforts, though I lack their adamantine certainty,” psychiatrist Phil Cowen said on the Science Media Centre website.
“No mental health professional” would endorse the view that a complex condition like depression  “stems from a deficiency in a single neurotransmitter”, Cowen added.
‘Mainstream’ psychiatry 
Some peers have questioned the methodology, which measured an indirect trace of serotonin rather than taking direct measurements of the molecule.
Moncrieff, who wants to break with what she calls  “mainstream” psychiatry, believes the serotonin theory still occupies an important, albeit less prominent, place in the profession.
“Even if leading psychiatrists were beginning to doubt the evidence for depression being related to low serotonin, no one told the public,” the British psychiatrist wrote on her blog.
The connection between depression and serotonin is firmly rooted in the popular imagination. French author Michel Houellebecq gave the title  “Serotonin” to his 2019 novel in which the main character is depressed.
Moncrieff’s undermining of the serotonin theory to argue against current anti-depressants, going beyond the conclusions of her own study, has sparked the most vehement criticism.
Swiss psychiatrist Michel Hofmann said her study was  “serious” and contributed to expert debates about depression.
“But I don’t think it is an article that should have any impact in the short term on the prescription of anti-depressants,” he said.
Moncrieff has warned that anti-depressant treatment should not be suddenly interrupted. But for her, the benefits of a course of anti-depressants are doubtful if it is based on a discredited theory. But many stress that the effectiveness of the treatments has been scientifically assessed, irrespective of the primary cause of depression.
The medicines used to treat depression  “are usually many and ultimately, in most cases, we don’t know what exactly makes a treatment effective”, Hofmann added.

1,Ice-age footprints shed light on North America’s early humans,Dozens of fossilised prints have been found in dried-up riverbeds in the US state of Utah.,"LOS ANGELES: Foot­prints laid down by Ice-Age hunter-gatherers and recently discovered in a US desert are shedding new light on North America’s earliest human inhabitants.
Dozens of fossilised prints found in dried-up riverbeds in the western state of Utah reveal more details about how the continent’s original occupants lived more than 12,000 years ago — just as the frozen planet was starting to thaw.
The fossils could have remained unnoticed if not for a chance glance out of a moving car as researchers Daron Duke and Thomas Urban drove through Hill Air Force Base chatting about footprints.
“We were talking about ‘what would they look like?’,” Duke said.  “And he said: Kind of like that out the window.’” What the two men had found turned out to be 88 distinct prints left by a mixture of adults and children.
“They vary between just looking like discolored patches on the ground and... little pop ups, little pieces of dirt around them or on them. But they look like footprints,” Duke said.
What came next was a painstaking few days of very careful digging — sometimes lying on his belly — to ensure that what they were looking at was as old as it appeared.
“What I found was bare feet of people... that had stepped in what looks to be shallow water where there was a mud sub layer,” Duke explained.
“The minute they pulled their foot out, the sand infilled that and has preserved it perfectly.” Duke, of the Nevada-based Far Western Anthropological Research Group, had been in the area looking for evidence of prehistoric campfires built by the Shoshone, a people whose descendents still live in the western United States.
He had brought Urban over from Cornell University because of his expertise in uncovering evidence of ancient humans -- including the discovery of human tracks in New Mexico’s White Sands National Park that are thought to be up to 23,000 years old.
The new fossils add to a wealth of other finds from the area, including stone tools, evidence of tobacco use, bird bones and campfire remains, that are starting to provide a more complete record of the Shoshone and their continuous presence in the region beginning 13,000 years ago.
“These are the resident indigenous people of North America, this is where they lived, and this is where they still live today,” Urban said. For him personally, finding the footprints has been a professional high point.

2,Dog Day Afternoon in Beirut for Lebanese man,BEIRUT: A customer armed with a rifle and threatening to set himself ablaze held bank workers hostage on Thursday in...,"BEIRUT: A customer armed with a rifle and threatening to set himself ablaze held bank workers hostage on Thursday in Lebanon’s capital, demanding to withdraw his trapped savings to pay hospital fees, security sources and a family member said. 
The incident is the latest between local banks and angry depositors unable to access their savings held in cash-starved banks because of informal capital controls in economic crisis-hit Lebanon. 
Security forces cordoned off a Federal Bank branch near west Beirut’s busy Hamra street where the armed man was holding staff hostage for several hours.
“He managed to get in with a pump-action rifle and flammable material, and threatened employees to give him his savings,” a security source told AFP, requesting anonymity. 
Another security source said a man in his forties “poured gasoline all over the bank, and closed the bank’s front door, holding employees hostage”.
He demanded more than $200,000 of his savings, the source said. 
The man “threatened to set himself on fire and to kill everyone in the branch, pointing his weapon in the bank manager’s face”, said Lebanon’s National News Agency (NNA). 
He said he stormed the bank because his father “was admitted to hospital some time ago for an operation and could not pay for it”, NNA reported. 
His brother Atef al-Cheikh Hussein told journalists: “My brother has $210,000 in the bank and wants to get just $5,000 to pay hospital bills.” His brother had grabbed the weapon “from the bank and did not bring it with him”.
A video circulating on social media showed two people negotiating with the armed man behind the bank’s iron door. 
He replied angrily, wielding the rifle in one hand and a cigarette in the other.
He later released one hostage, an AFP correspondent at the scene said, as dozens of onlookers and relatives of the hostages gathered outside.
Lebanon has been mired in a deep economic crisis since 2019, when the market value of the local currency began to plummet and banks started to enforce draconian restrictions on foreign and local currency withdrawals.
Lenders have also prevented transfers of money abroad.
“This is not the first such case, similar incidents keep happening, we need a radical solution,” George al-Hajj, who heads Lebanon’s bank employees union, told AFP outside the bank.
“Depositors want their money, and unfortunately their anger explodes in the face of bank employees because they cannot reach the management.” The local currency has lost more than 90 per cent of its value since the onset of the crisis.
Around 80 per cent of Lebanese live in poverty, according to the United Nations, amid rampant inflation and extended power cuts. 
International donors say aid is conditional on reforms, which politicians have so far resisted.

3,Iran brands US claim of Bolton plot ‘fiction’,TEHRAN: Iran dismissed as  “fiction” on Thursday US allegations it had plotted to kill former White House...,"TEHRAN: Iran dismissed as  “fiction” on Thursday US allegations it had plotted to kill former White House national security adviser John Bolton in retaliation for the assassination of one of its top commanders.
The US claim comes at a crunch moment in talks on reviving a nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that Washington had abandoned in 2018 but has said it wants to rejoin, with Iran now considering what European Union mediators have called a  “final” text.
“The US Justice Department has made allegations without providing valid evidence, creating a new work of fiction,” Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said.
“This time they have come up with a plot involving individuals like Bolton whose political career has failed,” Kanani scoffed.
“The Islamic Republic warns against any action that targets Iranian citizens by resorting to ridiculous accusations.” On Wednesday the US Justice Department announced it had stifled a plot by a member of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to kill Bolton, offering an unidentified person inside the United States $300,000 to carry out the job.
The alleged plan was likely set in retaliation for the US killing of top Guards commander Qasem Soleimani in Iraq in January 2020, the department said.
The plot, which stretched from October 2021 until April this year, never made headway because the ostensible assassin was an informant of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

4,"Arctic warming four times faster than rest of Earth, study warns",New UN report says Arctic is warming  “by more than double the global average” due to a process known as Arctic amplification.,"PARIS: The Arctic has warmed nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet over the last 40 years, according to research published on Thursday that suggests climate models are underestimating the rate of polar heating.
The United Nations’ climate science panel said in a special report in 2019 that the Arctic was warming  “by more than double the global average” due to a process known as Arctic amplification.
This occurs when sea ice and snow, which naturally reflect the Sun’s heat, melt into sea water, which absorbs it instead.
While there is a long-held consensus among scientists that the Arctic is warming quickly, estimates vary according to the timeframe studied and the definition of what constitutes the geographic area of the Arctic.
A team of researchers based in Norway and Finland analysed four sets of temperature data gathered by satellite studies since 1979 — the year when satellite data became available — over the entire Arctic circle.

5,"Wildfires burn, farmers struggle as another heatwave bakes western Europe",Severe drought is set to slash the European Union’s maize harvest by 15pc.,"HOSTENS: European nations sent firefighting teams to help France tackle a  “monster” wildfire on Thursday, while forest blazes also raged in Spain and Portugal and the head of the European Space Agency urged immediate action to combat climate change.
More than 1,000 firefighters, backed by water-bombing planes, battled for a third day a fire that has forced thousands from their homes and scorched thousands of hectares of forest in France’s southwestern Gironde region.
With a dangerous cocktail of blistering temperatures, tinder-box conditions and wind fanning the flames, emergency services were struggling to bring the fire under control. “It’s an ogre, a monster,” said Gregory Allione from the French firefighters body FNSPF said.
Heatwaves, floods and crumbling glaciers in recent weeks have heightened concerns over climate change and the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather across the globe.
The head of the European Space Agency, Josef Aschbacher, said rising land temperatures and shrinking rivers as measured from space left no doubt about the toll on agriculture and other industries from climate change.
ESA’s Copernicus Sentinel-3 satellite series has measured  “extreme” land surface temperatures of more than 45C (113F) in Britain, 50C in France and 60C in Spain in recent weeks.
“It’s pretty bad. We have seen extremes that have not been observed before,” Aschbacher said.
In Romania, where record temperatures and drought have drained rivers of water, Greenpeace activists protested on the parched banks of the Danube to draw attention to global warming and urge the government to lower emissions.
With successive heatwaves baking Europe this summer, searing temperatures and unprecedented droughts, renewed focus has been placed on climate change risks to farming, industry and livelihoods.
Severe drought is set to slash the European Union’s maize harvest by 15pc, dropping it to a 15-year a low, just as Europeans contend with higher food prices as a result of lower-than-normal grain exports from Russia and Ukraine.
Swiss army helicopters have been drafted in to airlift water to thirsty cows, pigs and goats sweltering under a fierce sun in the country’s Alpine meadows.
In France, suffering its harshest drought on record, trucks are delivering water to dozens of villages where taps have run dry, nuclear power stations have received waivers to keep pumping hot discharge water into river, and farmers warn a fodder shortfall may lead to milk shortages.
In Germany, scant rainfall this summer has drained the water levels of the Rhine, the country’s commercial artery, 
hampering shipping and pushing freight costs. However, as Europe contends with another heatwave, one group of workers has little choice but to sweat it out: gig-economy food couriers who often fall between the cracks of labour regulations.
After the mayor of Palermo on the island of Sicily in July ordered horses carrying tourists be given at least 10 litres of water per day, bicycle courier Gaetano Russo filed a suit demanding similar treatment. “Am I worth less than a horse,” Russo was quoted as saying in a Nidil CDIL union statement.
Britain’s Met Office on Thursday issued a four-day  “extreme heat” warning for parts of England and Wales.

6,Jamal Khashoggi’s ex-lawyer convicted of money-laundering,Asim Ghafoor has been convicted of  “money-laundering crimes linked to a US-based tax evasion operation”.,"DUBAI: The former US lawyer of slain Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has been convicted of money-laundering and fined but had a jail sentence overturned by a court in the UAE.
Asim Ghafoor was convicted of  “money-laundering crimes linked to a US-based tax evasion operation”, the official WAM news agency said late on Wednesday.
The Abu Dhabi Money Laundering and Tax Evasion Court rescinded a three-year jail term but raised a fine against Ghafoor to five million dirhams ($1.4 million) and ordered his deportation.
Ghafoor received the prison term and a three-million dirham fine following his arrest last month, reportedly as he was transiting Dubai airport.
Khashoggi, Ghafoor’s former client and associate, was murdered by Saudi agents in Istanbul in 2018, an incident that triggered a diplomatic backlash.
The case in the United Arab Emirates follows an  “assistance request” from US officials investigating Ghafoor’s  “involvement in tax evasion and suspicious money transfers”, WAM said.
“It was found that there was a money-laundering crime that occurred in the country, by the accused making international money transfers without proving their source,” it added.
The US embassy in Abu Dhabi did not respond to a request for comment.
In July, after the initial sentencing, the US State Department denied requesting Ghafoor’s arrest and said the case did not appear to be connected to his ties with Khashoggi.
Ghafoor, who attended Wednesday’s hearing, runs a private law firm and is a board member of Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a rights group founded by Khashoggi that called for his release in July.

7,UN proposes demilitarised zone near Ukraine N-plant,The Ukrainian plant is under the control of Russian troops and Ukraine has accused Moscow of basing soldiers and storing arms.,"KYIV: Russia and Ukraine accused each other of new shelling near the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on Thursday ahead of a UN Security Council meeting to address concerns over the facility’s security.
Both Moscow and Kyiv said there were five rocket strikes near a radioactive material storage area at the plant, Europe’s biggest nuclear facility which has been a focus of renewed fighting in recent days.
Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom said later there had been fresh Russian shelling near one of the plant’s six reactors that had caused  “extensive smoke” and  “several radiation sensors are damaged”.
Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Moscow-installed regional administration, said Ukrainian forces  “once again struck” the plant on messaging app Telegram.
The Ukrainian plant is under the control of Russian troops and Ukraine has accused Moscow of basing hundreds of soldiers and storing arms there.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned Russia could cause an incident  “even more catastrophic than Chernobyl” — a reference to the nuclear disaster in then Soviet Ukraine in 1986.
United Nations chief Antonio Guterres also said in a statement that continued hostilities around the facility could  “lead to disaster”.
He urged both sides  “to cease immediately” all military activity near the power plant.
The US State Department later on Thursday said the United States supported calls by the UN and others to establish a demilitarised zone around the plant.
“We continue to call on Russia to cease all military operations at or near Ukrainian nuclear facilities and return full control to Ukraine, and support Ukrainian calls for a demilitarized zone around the nuclear power plant,” said a State Department spokesperson. The Security Council is expected to meet at 1900 GMT. The Soviet-era plant in southern Ukraine was captured by Russian troops at the beginning of March — shortly after Moscow launched its invasion and has remained on the frontline since then.
“Russia has turned the nuclear station into a battlefield,” Zelensky said, addressing a Ukraine donors conference in Copenhagen by video link. He called for stronger sanctions against Russia saying it was a  “terrorist state” — on the same day that Latvian MPs adopted a resolution calling Russia a  “state sponsor of terrorism”.
The statement said Russia’s actions in Ukraine constituted  “targeted genocide against the Ukrainian people” and said the use of violence against civilians should be considered  “terrorism”.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba hailed it as a  “timely move” and urged other countries to follow suit, while Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called it  “xenophobia”.

8,Rajapaksa arrives in Bangkok after fleeing protests,BANGKOK: Former Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday arrived in Bangkok after his visa ran out...,"BANGKOK: Former Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Thursday arrived in Bangkok after his visa ran out following a month-long stint in Singapore where he had taken refuge from protesters at home.
The deposed leader landed on a private jet at Don Mueang International Airport around 8pm local time, a senior Thai official said. He left the airport’s VIP section around 40 minutes later with his wife and got into a black sedan, local media reported. 
Rajapaksa flew into Singapore from the Maldives on July 14 after fleeing a deepening economic crisis and widespread protests in Sri Lanka. He tendered his resignation shortly after his arrival. Sri Lankans arriving in Singapore normally receive a 30-day visa, but authorities said they had initially given Rajapaksa only two weeks and later extended the visa by another two weeks.
“The Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) confirms that Mr Gotabaya Rajapaksa left Singapore on 11 August,” Singapore’s immigration office said in reply.
The Thai foreign ministry, as well as a source in Colombo, had said that he was seeking a new safe haven in Thailand.
