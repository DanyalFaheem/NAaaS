0,Amnesty seeks immediate release of forcibly disappeared people,Human rights watchdog said govt should immediately inform all detainees of reasons for their arrest or detention.,"ISLAMABAD: Amnesty International has urged the government to immediately release forcibly disappeared people or promptly bring them before a judge in a civil court of law to prove the lawfulness of their arrest or detention.
In a report titled, ‘Braving the Storm: Enforced Disappearances and the Right to Protest’, released on Thursday, the human rights watchdog said the government should immediately inform all detainees of the reasons for their arrest or detention and provide them with full information about their rights, including prompt access to a lawyer to challenge the legality of their detention.
“The government should ensure that prompt, thorough, independent and impartial criminal investigations are conducted into all allegations of enforced disappearances. Where sufficient admissible evidence exists, prosecute those suspected of criminal responsibility in civilian courts in proceedings that conform to international fair trial standards. 
“Any independent and impartial investigation would preclude state agencies accused of involvement in alleged violations from investigating their own personnel or affiliates,” the human rights watchdog said. 
“The government should also ensure that investigations, and any prosecutions, are not limited to direct perpetrators but also address the criminal liability of those suspected of ordering, soliciting, planning, instigating, conspiring to commit, aiding or abetting, or otherwise assisting or facilitating commission of such crimes, as well as superiors who knew or should have known that a subordinate was committing or about to commit a crime but did not take all the reasonable and necessary measures within their power to prevent, repress or punish the crime,” the report says.
On the right to peaceful assembly of people, the Amnesty asked the government to facilitate and guarantee the right to freedom of peaceful assembly of people in protest rallies without discrimination. 
It (the government) should not use arbitrary detention, the registration of FIRs against peaceful protesters, and arrest of people for simply exercising their right to peaceful protest, the watchdog said.

1,Cable fault causes nationwide internet disruption,"Cable system, which was damaged at junction of Suez Canal and Mediterranean Sea , caused disruptions in other countries as well.","ISLAMABAD: A large number of internet users, mainly in Karachi, fa­­ced outages on Thursday evening as the submarine cable system SEAMEWE-5, extending from Singapore to France and Italy, was damaged. 
A statement issued by Transworld Home, the company operating the cable, said that a nationwide disruption was caused due to a ‘fibre cut in terrestrial network’. 
A senior official of IT and telecommunication ministry told Dawn that the disruption had occurred in the cable network of Transworld Associates, one of the three submarine cable operators in Pakistan. 
The cable system, which was damaged at the junction of Suez Canal and Mediterranean Sea near Egypt, caused disruptions in other countries as well. 
A senior Transworld Associates official said the cable was largely undersea, but a patch of around 480km was on land in Egypt to avoid disturbance due to the movement of ships in the Suez Canal. 
The official added that repair works on land were easier as compared to tracing and fixing the damage under the sea.
The South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 5 (SEAMEWE-5) submarine cable system, commissioned in 2016, is nearly 20,000 kilometres long, extending from Marseille in France to Singapore. 
Currently, there are seven submarine internet cable systems connecting to Pakistan, of which four are operated by Pakistan Telecom­mu­nication Company Limited, two by Transworld Associates and a new cable system that recently came online, owned by a Chinese company.

2,"Forced conversion ‘violation of Allah’s commands’, says Imran",Condemns the forced conversions of Hindu girls to Islam in Sindh.,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister and PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Thursday said that forced conversions of non-Muslims were against Islam and a “violation of Allah’s commands”. 
While addressing a minority convention, the former prime minister condemned the forced conversions of Hindu girls to Islam in Sindh. 
“There is an ayat (verse) in the Holy Quran [that] there is no coercion in Islam. This is Allah’s commandment. Whoever forcefully converts a non-Muslim is disobeying Allah.” He added that Allah even asked the Holy Prophet (PBUH) to only ‘preach His message’, and not worry about people entering the fold of Islam as this was not his responsibility. 
Mr Khan said that while there was a lot of hate in the world based on colour and religion, Islam did not believe in it. 
“Once a person starts practising Islam, he becomes a blessing for all hu­­m­ankind,” said Mr Khan, adding that Islam stresses on justice and equality. 
He cited the example of two caliphs who were summoned by the courts. 
“A Jew brought the case against Hazrat Ali but he lost the case, despite being the caliph, because the qazi [judge] refused to admit his [Hazrat Ali’s] son’s testimony.” 
He added that Islam stresses on justice and that’s why, 26 years ago, he decided to name the party as ‘Insaf ki tehreek’ (Movement for justice). Mr Khan also mentioned the killing of four Muslim men in the US state of New Mexico, claiming that their killing was a result of Islamophobia. 
However according to media reports, Albuquerque police has arrested the primary suspect who was also a Muslim and had developed differences with the decea­sed men over ‘personal animus’. 
Mr Khan also urged the masses to attend the public gathering on Aug 13 on the eve of Independence Day in Lahore’s National Hockey Stadium.

3,Raza Rabbani for revisiting policy of engagement with Tehreek-i-Taliban,Calls for reviewing the seven-year-old National Action Plan against terrorism.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party Senator Raza Rabbani has called for revisiting the policy of engagement with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and reviewing the seven-year-old National Action Plan (NAP) against terrorism. 
Talking to Dawn on Thursday, the former Senate chairman suggested that the new action plan should be prepared by the Parliamentary Committee on National Security (PCNS) having representation of all stakeholders, reminding that a similar committee had been constituted in 2012 after the US military operation in Abbottabad in which top Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden had been killed. 
The demands from the PPP senator came a day after Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, while speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, expressed his apprehensions at the success of talks with the TTP and admitted that anti-Taliban feelings were growing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as people were holding protest demonstrations in various parts of the province against the Taliban presence in their area. 
Mr Rabbani also condemned the increase in terrorist attacks in KP resulting in the martyrdom of the personnel of law enforcement agencies and the armed forces.
“These attacks suggest the need to revisit NAP as also the policy of engagement with the TTP as it also no longer seems to have a unified command,” said Mr Rabbani. 
The PPP senator suggested that the policy should be formulated in consultation with all stakeholders from the platform of a PCNS and then should be implemented after its approval from the joint sitting of the parliament. Moreover, he said its implementation should also be monitored by the committee and it should present a report on the state of implementation every three months to both the houses of the parliament. 
He also proposed that the Rules of the Parliamentary Com­mittee should be amended and instead of the National Assembly speaker, the chairman of the committee should be from the Senate as this matter related to the federation.

5,Recovery in youth employment still lagging: ILO,Sees global deficit falling to 4.5pc in 2022...,"ISLAMABAD: Though the pace of recovery in youth employment is still lagging in the aftermath of Covid-19, a new report by International Labour Organisation (ILO) says that less than half of the global youth employment deficit in 2020 is projected to be recovered by 2022.
The ILO report, “Global Employment Trends for Youth 2022”, released on Thursday, says the global deficit fell to 5.9 per cent and is projected to decrease further to 4.5pc in 2022. This implies a projected youth employment deficit of 19 million jobs in 2022.
The report, which marks the observance of International Youth Day on August 12, emphasised that as countries reassess their policy stance in the recovery phase, they need to invest in longer-term transformative approaches and overhaul their economic structures to make them more inclusive, sustainable and resilient. Accordingly, the report draws on a global macro-econometric model to quantify the economic and employment impacts of policy measures aimed at facilitating such transitions.
The unemployment rate of young people in the Asia and Pacific region is projected to reach 14.9pc in 2022, the same as the global average, although there are important divergences between sub-regions and countries.

Sees global deficit falling to 4.5pc in 2022

Young women are worse off than young men, exhibiting a much lower employment-to-population ratio (EPR). In 2022, 27.4pc of young women globally are projected to be in employment, compared to 40.3pc of young men, it says.
At the global level, the recovery of youth employment lags behind that of adults, who by 2022 are projected to recover more than half of their employment deficit in 2020. The youth labour force participation rate is projected to increase worldwide in 2022, but is nevertheless expected to remain more than one percentage point below the 2019 level. Global youth unemployment is projected to decline to 73 million in 2022, which would still be 6 million above the 2019 level, the report says.
The global employment deficit of young people relative to 2019 amounted to 8.2pc in 2020, whereas the corresponding deficit for adults was less than half of that. Young people were especially affected because firms that survived the crisis sought first and foremost to retain workers, while new recruitment collapsed.
In addition, young workers were less likely to have the seniority and types of contracts marking them out for retention by employers and hence were more likely to lose their job. Moreover, government-sponsored job retention schemes, where they existed, were less effective in protecting young workers.
The rise in youth unemployment by around 4m in 2020 grossly underestimates the labour market impact of the crisis. Global youth employment declined by 34m between 2019 and 2020. Most of the employment loss translated into labour force exit owing to the extraordinary circumstances of the crisis. The potential labour force, which comprises young people who are not part of the labour force but are marginally attached to the labour market, rose by 7m. The number of those outside the extended labour force rose by 27m.
The recovery in terms of youth unemployment rates is projected to diverge between low- and middle-income countries on the one hand, and high-income countries on the other. Indeed, high-income countries are the only ones expected to return by 2022 to youth unemployment rates close to what they were in 2019, while the rates are projected to remain well over 1 percentage point above their pre-crisis values in the other country income groups.
The Covid-19 crisis not only affected the employment prospects of young people but also disrupted the quality and quantity of education and training. Widespread school closures affected more than 1.6 billion learners. Disrupted education can cause significant learning losses, creating both intergenerational and intra-generational inequalities.

9,Shahbaz Gill charged with another offence; driver’s wife held,Court holds evidence against ARY News head insufficient.,"ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: PTI leader Shahbaz Gill was charged with another offence (disappearing evidence and giving false information), while the wife and brother-in-law of his driver were also arrested on Thursday in a case related to allegedly abetting mutiny and sedition.
Meanwhile, a court in Karachi discharged the head of the ARY News Ammad Yousaf from the case on Thursday.
Capital police officers told Dawn Section 201 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) — “causing disappearance of evidence of offence or giving false information to screen offender” — had been added to the FIR registered against Mr Gill.
The development comes two days after Mr Gill was arrested on charges of sedition and inciting the public against the state institutions, following his controversial remarks about the army on the news channel. Mr Gill’s driver/assistant, Izhar, was with him at the time of his arrest at Banigala Chowk in Islamabad and claimed he had been subjected to violence during the episode.

Court holds evidence against ARY News head insufficient

Police officers said the recording of the ARY News programme in which Mr Gill appeared had also been sent to the FIA for voice matching along with samples of his voice.
Officers said Mr Gill possessed his mobile phone at the time of the arrest, but its disappearance was noticed when the investigators came to collect it to send it to the FIA for forensic test and recover data.
Instead, a feature phone (the one with button-based inputs and a small non-touch display) was found with him instead of a smartphone, the officers said. On inquiry, Mr Gill replied that he left his smartphone at Banigala, though investigators believed he was hiding the truth.
They believed Mr Gill had either left his smartphone in his vehicle during the arrest or thrown it away somewhere else and now the mobile was in the custody of his driver.
The investigators also inquired about the place from where Mr Gill appeared in the news programme via an audio call and inquired about the script from which he was read. However, while the PTI leader disclosed the location from where he appeared in the bulletin, he denied reading from any script. However, the investigators insisted either Mr Gill was reading from written material or it was recorded audio.
FIR against driver, others
In the FIR registered against Mr Izhar and others, police said Mr Gill — who has been remanded in police custody — revealed during interrogation that he had given his mobile phone, which contained considerable matter regarding the case against him, to Mr Izhar, at the time of his arrest. 
The FIR said he told police that Mr Izhar still had his mobile and was living at his in-laws’ residence.
Following this revelation, a special raiding party was constituted and sent to the house where Mr Izhar was staying at 1:40am on Thursday, the FIR said.
It said Mr Izhar’s wife, Meh­re­en, and another suspect, Noman, were arrested from the scene while the rest managed to flee because of the dark. Subsequently, a case was registered against all the suspects at Aabpara police station under sections 147, 149, 186, 353, 382 and 506 of the PPC.
In a late-night move, Izhar’s brother-in-law was shifted to Pims Hospital in Islamabad after his condition got deteriorated, police officers said. He fell unconscious outside the lockups when he was taken out from there. Shortly, he was taken to the hospital where he was given emergency medical assistance. He later regained consciousness and was said to be in stable condition.
Meanwhile, Mr Gill was also brought to Pims for medical examination and was found in good health and had no marks of injury on his body, the police said. A police spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
Case against ARY News official
Meanwhile, a local court in Karachi on Thursday discharged the head of the ARY News Ammad Yousaf from the case.
On Wednesday, Memon Goth police arrested Mr Yousaf from his DHA residence and booked over his alleged involvement in abetting criminal conspiracy, mutiny, sedition and other charges. Others booked in the case included the channel’s CEO Salman Iqbal, journalists Arshad Sharif and Khawar Ghuman, programme’s producer Raja Adeel and PTI leader Shahbaz Gill.
On Thursday, the investigating officer produced him before Malir’s Judicial Magistrate Rana Saifullah Hassan to seek his physical remand in police custody for interrogation and investigation.
The investigating officer submitted that Mr Yousaf had been booked in the present case and his physical custody was required for interrogation to complete the investigation and other legal formalities.
Separately, PTI chief Imran Khan has condemned the arrest of Mr Yousaf, lamenting that his daughter went into a state of shock when law enforcement agencies “barged into his house at 2am”.
Such things never happen in civilised societies, he said while addressing a minority convention in Islamabad on Thursday.
The former prime minister also condemned the arrest of Mr Gill’s wife and said that it was unfortunate that law enforcement agencies did not think that how her little daughter would live without mother.

10,COAS Bajwa to be chief guest at Sandhurst passing-out parade in UK,"During the visit, COAS will also call on the military leadership of the UK.","LONDON: Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa arrived in the United Kingdom on an official visit early on Thursday morning, the military’s media wing said. 
The army chief will attend the passing-out parade at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) press release said on Thursday. The army chief will be chief guest at the ceremony. 
During the visit, the COAS will also call on the military leadership of the UK, the media affairs wing of the armed forces said. 
Sources said the visit was “a standardised official military visit” in keeping with an annual tradition.
Due to the pandemic, the army chief had not visited Sandhurst over the last couple of years, but had been a regular visitor each year since he took over as head of the army. 
The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS) is one of several military academies of the United Kingdom and is the British Army’s initial officer training centre. 
All British Army officers, including late-entry officers who were previously Warrant Officers, as well as other men and women from overseas, are trained at the academy. Sandhurst is the British Army equivalent of the Britannia Royal Naval College and the Royal Air Force College Cranwell. 
The RMAS was formed on the site of the former Royal Military College in 1947 when it amalgamated with the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich.
Following the ending of National Service in the UK and the closing of the Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot in 1972, the RMAS became the sole establishment for male initial officer training in the British Army.
