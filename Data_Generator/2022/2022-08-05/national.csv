PM Sharif, during a daylong visit to flood-hit areas of Dera Ismail Khan and Tank districts on Thursday, announced an increase in the financial assistance for those affected by the natural calamity. 
The premier was quoted by APP as saying, “God willing, you will see there will be no politics or discrimination in it,” he said about relief activities during his int­eraction with people displaced by flash floods.
The PM visited Meeran village of Parova tehsil and Band Korai village of Paharpur tehsil in Dera Ismail Khan, and Pai, Ranwal, Garah Shahbaz, Chirhi, Therhi and other villages of Tank district. 
Addressing the affected families, he said every challenge, including floods, could be tackled with unity and collective efforts. He urged the KP government of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf to increase the compensation amount to Rs1 million for the heirs of each deceased person. He also asked the provincial government to speed up the rehabilitation process. 
PM Sharif announced Rs1 million for each deceased’s heir, Rs0.2m for each injured, Rs0.25m for partial damage to house and Rs0.5m for completely damaged house. He pointed out that 58 per cent revenue of the National Finance Co­­mmission went to provinces. He expressed sympathies with flood affectees and assured them of all kinds of cooperation. 
While briefing the PM, Tank Deputy Commissioner Hameedullah Khattak said 437 houses had been damaged, adding that the floods had also devastated standing crops, livestock in Pai, Ranwal and adjoining villages of Garah Shahbaz, Chirhi and Therhi. A senior citizen in Pai village told Mr Sharif that no prime minister had ever come to their area during the past 60 years. 
In Tank, the PM visited three medical camps, a temporary camp in the Amakhel area as well as a relief camp in a Ramak School where about 200 to 300 families were given food and non-food items besides medical treatment. 
The PM was informed that flash floods had damaged about 293 houses besides destroying 1,720 hectares of agricultural land.  He said a joint survey would be conducted by the federal and provincial governments, NDMA, PDMA and other relevant authorities to assess the damage caused by rains and floods to crops and livestock so that compensation amount could be provided to those affected. 
He directed the National Highway Authority to immediately start rebuilding destroyed roads. 
While referring to poor countries that had made progress, PM Sharif said Pakistan could achieve economic prosperity and come out of the influence of IMF by hard work and effective utilisation of natural resources. 
PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who accompanied the premier, said that work on Nawaz Sharif government’s mega projects that was halted during the last four years in D.I. Khan would be restarted.

3,Kamil gets notice for removing Shujaat from top slot,ECP asked to stop ‘illegal’ intra-party election called by PML-Q’s Punjab general secretary on 10th.,"LAHORE: The PML-Q has issued a show-cause notice to its Punjab general secretary Kamil Ali Agha for taking an illegal step of calling a party meeting and removing Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain from the president’s slot.
The decision to issue the notice was taken at the PML-Q’s Central Execu­tive Committee meeting attended by party members, including secretary general Tariq Bashir Cheema, provincial presidents and central officials, in Islamabad on Thursday.
The participants expres­sed full confidence in the leadership of Chaudhry Shujaat through unanimous resolutions.
Presidents of the PML-Q Sindh, Balochistan, Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan chapters disowned the party’s meeting held in Lahore last week. 

ECP asked to stop ‘illegal’ intra-party election called by PML-Q’s Punjab general secretary on 10th

They also strongly condemned the declaration regarding the health of Chaudhry Shujaat, as well as the Lahore meeting that dared to remove him and Cheema from their party positions.
Another resolution passed by the party’s CEC on Thursday declared the upcoming session summoned by Kamil Ali Agha on Aug 10 “un-mandatory” and added the Punjab organisation did not have the authority to summon any session. Moreover, party leaders who participated in the meeting earlier called by Senator Agha would also be suspended, the resolution said.
Since the PML-Q ‘CEC’ meeting held last week, led by Senator Agha in Lahore, had decided to hold intra-party elections in 10 days and constituted a five-member election commission, it is learnt the PML-Q has approached the election commission and sought to stop the “illegal” election called by the party’s Punjab general secretary. 
The rift within the PML-Q and, particularly within the family of Chaudhrys of Gujrat, had surfaced after party president Shujaat had written a letter to the party’s 10 MPAs, including Chaud­hry Parvez Elahi, to vote for PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz, who was contesting the chief minister’s election against Mr Elahi himself.
Soon after Mr Elahi won the chief minister’s election with the votes of all 10 PML-Q MPAs, Senator Agha had called a central executive committee meeting and passed different resolutions, including seeking removal of president Shujaat and secretary general Cheema. 
The meeting was atten­ded by 83 out of the total 150 members of the committee. The quorum of the meeting was 40 members. 
A source in the Parvez Elahi camp told Dawn that the party would hold fresh intra-party elections on the announced date and elect a new president and secretary general.

4,Justice Sajjad Ali Shah complains to CJP about remarks against Sindh nominees at JCP meeting,"Questioning judges' integrity on basis of hearsay from one or two lawyers who were not even named is regrettable, he says.","ISLAMABAD: Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, a member of the nine-member Judicial Commission of Pakistan, has expressed his disappointment over comments made during the July 28 JCP session about the integrity of two nominees from Sindh. 
In a one-page letter written to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial on July 30, Justice Shah regretted a member of the commission claimed that he had gained information about credentials of the nominee judges from Sindh through one or two lawyers who hail from the province. 
Justice Shah’s letter is the fourth written to the CJP after last week’s JCP session. Earlier, Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood and Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf had also written letters to the CJP. 
“The worth of such information could be gauged from the fact that the Pakistan Bar Council’s (PBC) representative in JCP — Akhtar Hussain — did not question the integrity of judges, but specifically stated that as far as Justice Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi (both from Sindh) are concerned, he is disputing their nomination on the basis of seniority and had no issue with other traits. 
“With all humility and respect at my command, I must record that the honourable member did not have the confidence in his colleagues to consult them on this matter,” the letter said. 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah recalled that two members of the JCP had not only served as judges in the Sindh High Court (SHC) for more than a decade but had also been appointed its chief justice. 
Justice Sajjad said two more judges presently serving in the Supreme Court, other than JCP members, had served in the SHC for a decade and could have been consulted about the eligibility of the two nominees from Sindh. 
Justice Shah said since he had worked with the two SHC judges for a number of years, he could attest to their integrity. 
“I would like to state that questioning the integrity of judges on the basis of hearsay from one or two lawyers who were not even named was regrettable,” the judge said. 
It appeared that some elements had resorted to defaming the two nominees, Justice Shah said, adding that the CJP should do “everything in his power to restore their reputation”.
“Let us not lose sight of the fact that these nominees did not apply for this candidature, but were nominated on the basis of their credentials,” Justice Shah observed. 
The AGP spoke nothing about the competence of any nominee judge during the JCP meeting, Justice Shah added. 
“On the contrary, when one of the judicial members of the commission called for rejection of the nominations, the AGP sought adjournment of the session till settlement of the criteria for selection of candidates,” he said.
“Since I will be laying down my robes in a few days (Aug 14), I would not have the onerous duty of attending the next meeting of JCP. Therefore, I request the CJP to place this letter on record,” Justice Shah said. 
Disagreements among members of the judicial commission were not unusual, but the objections surrounding such disagreements had been less acrimonious in the past, the letter said.

5,Telcos directed to ensure national roaming by end of the year,National roaming will help users of one network to avail the cellular services of another network if they go out of coverage.,"ISLAMABAD: The IT ministry has directed telecom companies to implement national roaming by the end of this year so that citizens in areas with patchy network coverage can make calls and send messages using any cellular service.
National roaming — to be imp­lemented on motorways, highways and some tourist spots thro­ugh the Universal Service Fund (USF) — will help users of one network (for example, Ufone) to avail the cellular services of another network (such as Telenor or Jazz). Simply put, you’ll be able to use services of another network if you go out of coverage.
“The telcos have been directed to settle the framework and charges agreement for national roaming with the PTA to implement it before the end of 2022,” IT Minister Syed Aminul Haque said.
He said national roaming would be essential on highways, motorways and at some tourist spots because no company had full coverage at such places.
However, telecom companies have yet to agree on call rates they would charge consumers and share with each other.
Meanwhile, national roaming has been made mandatory for all USF projects on motorways and some isolated spots with patchy network coverage.
The USF works under the IT ministry to develop telecommunication services in unserved and underserved areas. It has no government funding and contributions come from 1.5 per cent of the adjusted revenues of telecom operators. 
A senior USF official said all technical arrangements had been made to implement national roaming, including security permissions, but the four telecom companies had yet to finalise the rate of national roaming calls.
The official said it had been proposed that the rate of national roaming should be 1.25 or 1.5 times higher than normal rates.
“As a result of national roaming, almost all the highways and motorways will get connected, as not every single company is required to establish its base along the complete route,” the official said.
Currently, the USF projects are under way at M3 and M5 motorways, Coastal Highway and National Highway 50 and 70.
The USF has estimated that out of around 13,000 kilometres of highways and motorways in the country, some 8,000km were not connected with telecom and broadband services.
According to its initial report, Balochistan paints a grim picture, as only 243km of its 4,129km highway network is served while 3,886km is unserved.

7,North Waziristan roads blocked against killings,"Business centres, markets and shops closed in in several areas on call of a jirga of Uthmanzai tribe.","NORTH WAZIRISTAN: Life came to a standstill in North Waziristan tribal district on Thursday after residents blocked all roads and observed a shutter-down strike as part of a ‘protest movement’ launched three weeks ago against targeted killings.
Business centres, markets and shops were closed in Miramshah, Mirali and other small towns of the district on the call of a jirga of Uthmanzai tribe.
Thousands of people took part in the street protests. They placed boulders on the Bannu-Miramshah Road, Thall-Mirali Road, Ghulam Khan Road, Razmak Road, Datakhel Road and many other link roads suspending vehicular traffic for long hours. They also burned old tyres.
A 50-strong organising committee oversaw the protests.
Committee head Malik Rab Nawaz said the North Waziristan Political Alliance, transporters and other associations ‘fully’ supported the protest.
The elders of Uthmanzai tribe had begun a protest against the growing incidence of targeted killings in the district insisting dozens of people lost life in those incidents. 
The residents had organised a sit-in protest in Eidak village and later extended protests to the entire district.
On Wednesday, senior officials of the district administration held several meetings with tribal elders in an attempt to persuade them to call off the protest, but to no avail.
The officials promised more steps to check targeted killings but the elders demanded a ‘firm guarantee’ about it. 
The committee also announced that the sit-in participants would go to Islamabad if targeted killings didn’t stop.

9,PTI withdraws case against CEC ‘to add more evidence’,"Fawad Chaudhry says reference to be filed again after considering additional aspects, including amendments to initial verdict.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) withdrew a reference against Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Thursday, a day after filing it with the Supreme Judicial Council, to add more evidence and highlight further legal aspects.
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry told journalists in Islamabad the reference would be filed again after adding more evidence against the CEC, including amendments to the initial verdict and subsequent addition.
Moved through Babar Awan, the reference pleaded with the SJC to order the removal of the CEC on account of the “commission of continuous and deliberate misconduct”.
The reference alleged that on July 29, a delegation of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) met the CEC and four other members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in his office to “pressure” him into announcing the verdict on the PTI prohibited funding case.

Fawad Chaudhry says reference to be filed again after considering additional aspects, including amendments to initial verdict

It was a consequence of that meeting that the ECP decided to deliver the verdict on Aug 2, the reference alleged, adding that by doing so the CEC had allegedly violated his oath.
The reference contended that the ECP’s decision was illegal, unlawful and coram non judice, i.e. before a court that lacks the authority to hear and decide the case.
It said the PTI would challenge the order in court and the CEC had violated the ECP’s code of conduct and failed to fulfil his constitutional obligations.
The code of conduct for judges of the superior judiciary applied to the chief election commissioner as well, the PTI said, adding that a high court judge never discussed pending cases with any person or institution.
“The CEC must be removed from one of the most respectable and sacred constitutional posts,” the reference said.
CEC Sultan Raja had dismissed many PTI applications in the prohibited funding case, including a request to conduct a joint hearing in funding cases of PTI and other parties, the reference said.
It said the Islamabad High Court had provided relief to the PTI, asking the ECP to extend equal treatment to all political parties and to hear their cases with due diligence and conclude these within a reasonable time.
Instead, the ECP announced a verdict in the PTI case only and kept the cases of other parties in abeyance, the reference said and described it as “absolute discrimination”.
It was a routine matter that judges of the Supreme Court meet members of the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and other lawyer forums, but it had been observed recently that the apex court refused to meet a delegation of the Supreme Court Bar Association during hearing of the suo motu petition under article 184(3) of the Constitution in the “Parvez Elahi versus Deputy Speaker, Punjab Assembly” case since it was one of the parties in the proceedings, it said.
The same rule applied to the CEC, the reference said, but he not only met the PDM delegation but also admitted that a discussion did take place on the timing of the judgement in PTI prohibited funding case.

10,Man carrying IED dies in blast near DC office,Suspect ‘went missing’ a few months ago...,"HYDERABAD: A suspect was killed in the small hours of Thursday morning near the offices of deputy commissioner, Jamshoro, when the improvised explosive device (IED) he was carrying went off.  
His body was found in nearby bushes. 
Police and administration officials confirmed the incident.  
The deceased was identified as Allah Bux, son of Maula Bux. His father is posted as ASI at the Site Police Station, Kotri.

Suspect ‘went missing’ a few months ago

The suspect also carried a remote control which was, apparently, to be used for detonating the device.  
According to Jamshoro Deputy Commissioner Fariduddin Mustafa, the man died at a place not far away from his office. He said the suspect might have tried to plant the bomb outside the DC office to cause casualties on Thursday morning when visitors started visiting his office. 
The SSP said no one claimed res­p­onsibility for the blast but he did not rule out involvement of the nationalist Sindhudesh Revolutio­nary Army (SRA) group. The SRA has been carrying out subversive activities by blasting tracks and attacking officials of law enforcement agencies in Sindh at regular intervals. 
A bomb disposal squad official Ramzan Panhwar said that around 200 to 300 grams of explosives and ball bearings were used in the canister to make the IED.  
He said the main railway track was passing through the area at some distance from the DC office. He said the body was badly damaged by the impact of the blast. 
The DC said that just a day before, police had informed him that security would be withdrawn from his office as per the directions of Police Headquarters to minimise security. 
Police and other law enforcement agencies launched investigation into the incident. Mr Panhwar said evidence had been collected from the place of the occurrence. 
DSP Kotri Malik Riaz and SHO Site police station, Kotri, Sub Inspector Khair Mohammad Mallah said the suspect was 35 years old and a resident of Ibrahim Kachhi village of Dadu district. 
The SSP said security was tightened at the government offices in Jamshoro after the incident. 
Later, a case was registered under sections 4 and 5 of the Explosives Act, sections 6 and 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, and Section 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code on a complaint of Police Post Telegraph in-charge ASI Ayaz Abro at the CTD police station, Hyderabad. 
The FIR said Mustafa Chandio, an employee of Gopang Hotel located near the DC office, had reported the explosion over the phone. In the blast, the activist of a banned organisation was killed, who while planting the bomb. 
The identity card of the suspect and other items were recovered, according to details of the case.
