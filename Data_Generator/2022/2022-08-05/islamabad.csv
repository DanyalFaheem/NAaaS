0,SC upholds high court verdict against sale of ETPB property in Raja Bazaar,Case concerns sale of property in 1992 in pursuance of the approval of then federal minister for social welfare in 1977.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected a plea moved by a real estate investor against a high court judgement concerning a commercial property located in Raja Bazaar Rawalpindi belonging to the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB).
A two-judge Supreme Court bench consisting of Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi had taken up the plea moved by Raja Ali Zaman (deceased).
The case concerned the sale of the property in 1992 in pursuance of the approval of the then federal minister for social welfare in 1977.
The commercial property was under the control of ETPB and was initially rented out to Raja Ali Zaman and Raja Mohammad Banaras (vendees) by the then competent authority on behalf of the ETPB. The tenants approached the then federal minister for social welfare and rural development for outright sale of the property to them.
Consequently, through a March 22, 1977, letter, the request was accorded but the federal government in a memorandum dated May 13, 1977, restrained the ETPB from finalising the deal.
But on June 6, 1992, the deputy administrator ETPB Rawalpindi executed the sale deed in favour of the vendees.
Subsequently, the ETBP challenged the sale deed on different grounds in Lahore High Court (LHC). The plea in the Supreme Court was filed against the LHC judgement.
The appellants argued before the court that they had a valid sale deed executed in 1992 through the ETPB official on the basis of a letter of the concerned ministry, thus there was valid sale deed and the order of high court was not sustainable.
Senior counsel Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar, who appeared before the apex court on behalf of ETPB, told Dawn that he argued that the then federal minister in year 1977 had no authority under the ETPB’s law to accord approval for such an alleged sale and no evacuee property could be sold and disposed of outside the scope of Evacuee Trust Properties (Management and Disposal) Act 1975.
The lawyer also submitted that in league with certain ETPB officials, private parties got a letter issued and executed a sale deed by sheer misrepresentation and without prior approval of the federal government, adding a letter obtained through collusion could not be treated as the direction of the federal government.
He also argued that disciplinary action was taken and recommended against officials involved in the collusive sale deed, stating that the meaning of the federal government and conduct of its business has been mentioned and prescribed in Articles 99 and 173 of the constitution.
Thus, the executive actions on behalf of the federal government could earlier be done in the name of the president. Now, after the 18th constitutional amendment, it is done by the cabinet. The sale executed in year 1992 in favour of the private appellants based on the approval of the minister in 1977 undoubtedly was unauthorised, and executed by incompetent authority violative to the Evacuee Trust Property Board 1975  and the constitution and could not be protected.
He argued that there was neither any approval by ETPB nor by the federal government regarding such an alleged sale deed and the entire case was made and started by the appellant on the letter of approval by then federal minister, which under the law he did not have the authority to issue such instructions.
Moreover, the evacuee property could only be sold after adopting due process and with the approval of the board and then on such recommendations to the federal government under Sections 4, 6 of the Evacuee Trust Property Board 1975, whereas in the present case there was no such approval of any alleged sale deed given by either the ETPB or by the federal government.
The ETPB lawyer contended that the high court had rightly considered all the points and decided on merit and prayed before the court that the appeal of private appellants and the application of others be rejected and the judgment of the high court be upheld.
The Supreme Court after hearing both the sides dismissed the appeal along with other applications and upheld the high court order.

2,NA body approves bill to repeal MTI Act of Pims,"Act of 2021 may be repealed to declare hospital as an attached department of health ministry again, says draft bill.","ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on National Health Services (NHS) on Thursday unanimously passed the “Federal Medical Teaching Institute (MTI) Repeal Bill 2022” moved by MNA Noor Alam Khan.
MNA Khan had submitted the bill alleging that former prime minister Imran Khan wanted to introduce American policies/system which were not feasible in Pakistan. The MTI Act was passed during the tenure of the PTI government and introduced at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Islamabad. Moreover, similar legislation was made in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab as well.
According to the draft bill, available with Dawn, Pims was established in 1985 as a tertiary care hospital/research centre. The institute comprises nine components - five hospitals and four teaching institutes i.e. Islamabad Hospital, Children Hospital, MCH, Burn Care Centre, Cardiac Care Centre, College of Medical Technology, College of Nursing, School of Dentistry and Quaid-i-Azam Postgraduate Medical Centre.
The institute was working smoothly but during the previous regime its status was changed from an attached department of the federal government to an autonomous body due to which the ailing humanity and federal government servants have been suffering a lot and the service standards in the hospital are deteriorating day by day. Moreover, Pims employees have become frustrated, it said.

Act of 2021 may be repealed to declare hospital as an attached department of health ministry again, says draft bill

“Keeping in view the above situation it is proposed that the Federal Medical Teaching Institutes Act 2021 (Act No.XII of 2021) may be repealed and the department may be declared as an attached department of Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) for smooth functioning and improvement of the Institute,” it stated.
Earlier, MNA Khan, who is a dissident legislator of PTI, had said though it was an individual’s bill, he had already done lobbying to ensure that it sailed through parliament.
In November 2020, President Dr Arif Alvi promulgated the MTI ordinance suggesting that the hospital will be run through a board of governors (BoG). According to the ordinance, the BoG would deal with all affairs of Pims. Its members were appointed and notified by the ministry of NHS on the recommendation of a search and nomination council.
Though employees protested against the ordinance it sailed through the parliament.
Later, the committee directed the ministry of NHS to hold a meeting with the Ministry of Law to remove lacunas in the proposed legislation, if any.
It deferred the Pakistan Nursing Council (Emergency Management) 2022, a government bill and the ICT Tuberculosis (Notification) Bill 2022, moved by Uzma Riaz till the next meeting.
The committee expressed annoyance over the absence of the president and registrar of Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) to answer queries. It deferred the agenda of the PMC with the direction to the officials to ensure their presence in the next meeting.
The meeting was attended by MNAs Dr Nisar Ahmed Cheema, Dr Samina Matloob, Dr Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro, Shamsun Nisa, Ramesh Lal, James Iqbal, Noor Alam Khan and Sajid Mehdi.
The meeting was held at Parliament House under the chairmanship of Dr Mohammad Afzal Khan Dhandla. The members welcomed the newly-elected chairman and assured him of their full cooperation for smooth functioning of the committee.
They also appreciated the services of Khalid Hussain Magsi, the ex-chairman, under which the committee worked as a team to resolve issues of the ministry and its attached departments.

4,Classes to begin in Maira Bagwal College from Aug 15,"Over 100 students enrolled, necessary arrangements in place...","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) is all set to start classes in Islamabad Model College for Boys (IMCB) Maira Bagwal from Aug 15 and it has also been decided to merge the nearby boys’ school with the new college so that the school’s building could be utilised for girls’ education.
The building of Maira Bagwal College, after 33 long years, is set to open its doors for students as around 160 students have already been enrolled in this college. Whereas, 138 students of the nearby boys’ school will be shifted to the college. The building of the boys’ school will be used for setting up a higher secondary school (inter college) for girls.
The college, located in a rural area near Bhara Kahu, was constructed in 1989, but successive governments failed to take measures for classes to begin in it. The college was built for technical education, but it could not be made functional.
In 1985, the government had decided to set up a new polytechnic college in Islamabad and the locals donated 232 kanals for this project in Maira Bagwal. Construction of the building was completed in 1989 but the college was awaiting its inauguration since then.

Over 100 students enrolled, necessary arrangements in place

However, following continuous efforts during the last few years by locals led by their MNA and director general of FDE Dr Ikram Ali Malik, the Ministry of Education, last year allowed FDE to take over the said building to start IMCB from class one to 12. Subsequently, in February this year, FDE issued a notification and deputed teaching and non teaching staff in the college. It is the first ever model college in Bhara Kahu area.
Dr Ali along with several directors of FDE visited the college on Thursday to review arrangements made by the college administration.
He inspected renovation work and issued directions for bringing more improvement.
When contacted, the DG said: “Yes, we are going to start classes in (IMCB) Maira Bagwal and five other new institutions from Aug 15. This IMCB will be highly beneficial for the rural population. It is also a blessing for those parents who have been facing transport related financial issues for sending their kids to IMCBs located in urban areas,” the DG said and added that the nearby boys’ school, which is located within a 1 kilometre radius of the college will be merged with IMCB and the building of the school will be used for girls’ education.
“I hope this IMCB and Girls Higher Secondary School (inter college) will bring a positive change in this huge rural area and will also reduce burden of admissions in model colleges of urban areas,” the DG said.
Earlier, he was told that over 160 students have already been enrolled and all necessary arrangements have been made for starting classes from Aug 15.
Officials said that FDE wants to hold a mega opening ceremony of all six new institutions particularly IMCB Maira Bagwal, which is likely to be attended by Education Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain.
Meanwhile, talking about the merger of the boys’ school with IMCB an official of FDE said: “Actually, we are going to merge the boys’ school with the college while one section of girls’ high school will be shifted to the boys’ school building and the existing girls’ school will be made a higher secondary school from class six to 12,” the official said.
He said locals and School Management Committees (SMCs) of both the boys’ and girls’ schools had been pursuing the FDE, as by doing this it will have a separate girls college as well.
The official said that three college buses have been allotted to the new IMCB for providing pick and drop service to students while a coaster has been provided to the college administration for pick and drop of staff.

5,IHC denies bail to convict over ‘conduct’,ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday granted post-arrest bail to a convict in a land grabbing case...,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday granted post-arrest bail to a convict in a land grabbing case while the same was denied to the co-convict owing to his “conduct”.
In an appeal filed in the high court, Afzal Khokhar and Chaudhry Abdul Rehman who were handed a 5-year jail term requested the court to suspend their sentence. Last week, a trial court jailed them for taking over 135 kanal of land forcibly.
At the time of the announcement of the verdict, Khokhar was arrested from inside the courtroom whereas Rehman before the pronouncement of the verdict fled the courtroom to avoid arrest.
As the IHC took up their appeal, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan suspended the sentence of Khokhar and granted him post-arrest bail. However, Rehman was denied relief in the case because of his conduct.
Rehman’s counsel defended his client’s conduct and said that Rehman had left the courtroom on account of ill health and was subsequently moved to a hospital. 
He said that the convict has now surrendered before the court; therefore, his sentence might be suspended till the final adjudication of the appeal against the decision of the additional district and sessions judge.
Justice Khan observed, “It appears that the role of the present appellant is not co-extensive with that of his co-convict”. 
The judge further observed that Rehman was a member of the company that has been accused of land grabbing. Justice Khan issued notice to the complainant and adjourned further hearing till August 10.
It may be mentioned that Rehman was arrested in February last year under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) after the district administration cracked down on land grabbers on the directives of then prime minister Imran Khan. The IHC had granted him post-arrest bail, however.
Initially, complainant Ishtiaqul Salikeen nominated Imtiaz alias Taji Khokar and Chaudhry Ali Akbar along with the above-mentioned individuals in a decade-old 135 kanal land grabbing case. 
Their names however were deleted from the complaint after their demise.
The complainant contended that Rehman and his accomplices asked him to sell his 135 kanal for his private housing society.
As per the complaint, Salikeen refused to sell his land and turned down their offer. However, they forcibly took possession of the land.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Abdul Ghafoor Kakar in March this year ordered the deputy commissioner, inspector general and the SSP for the recovery of the land under the Land Dispossession Act 2005 from Rehman, adding the possession of the land be given to the complainant, who as per the court order was its actual owner.
The complainant contended that Rehman along with his accomplices forcibly took over possession of his 135 kanal and converted it into over 400 residential and commercial units and sold out to different buyers.
He said on the direction of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the additional deputy commissioner revenue (ADCR) had appointed a commission to furnish demarcation of the land. 
The revenue officer in his report pointed out that “multiple high-rise commercial and residential buildings were constructed over there” and stressed the need for assistance of the Survey of Pakistan as the demarcation could not be possible by the revenue officials.
As per the order of ADSJ, the demarcation report was then submitted but the owners of the society objected that the ADCR was supposed to complete the job but it was done by a naib tehsildar.
The judge, on the other hand, was of the view that the land was demarcated in accordance with the directions of the Supreme Court. 
He directed the senior police officers and the district administration to give possession of the land to Salikeen from the “illegal occupation and possession of the respondents or any other illegal occupants.”

Talking to Dawn, Fazal Quyyum, a resident of Mohala Adda, said the two officials – a sub-divisional officer and a lineman - removed an electric meter from the house of a woman residing in his neighbourhood. He approached a senior officer of Wapda and lodged a complaint against them some months ago.

He said he tried to get the bill corrected but no one in Wapda listened to him so he had to pay the bill in installments. Afterwards, Mr Qayyum informed Wapda’s chief executive officer about what had happened. An inquiry was conducted against the two officials again and they were found guilty, he said, adding that they removed electric meters from three houses and the service station, since there was no electricity there for the last five months.
Instead of action against the two officials, they were transferred to another place, he added.
Later, Mr Qayyum approached the deputy commissioner, on whose directives, a case was registered against them at Secretariat police station. According to the first information report (FIR), the complainant is a poor man and the two officials sent him a bill of 5,788 units.
