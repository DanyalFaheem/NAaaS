“THE last 24 hours have been like a whirlwind,” says Nooh Dasta­gir Butt. “It’s an amazing feeling to see your dreams come true.”
Since becoming Pakistan’s first gold medallist at the Common­wealth Games in Birmingham on Wednesday, the 24-year-old weightlifter has been lapping up the adulation coming his way.
Nooh has received messages of congratulations from all over the world. Just about everyone wants a piece of him right now.
But with his phone broken, the only way to get to him is through his coach Irfan Butt. That is, if you’re lucky enough to get through considering Irfan has been flooded with calls and interview requests.“My phone is broken,” Nooh told Dawn in an exclusive interview from Birmingham on Thursday night. “I just got an iPhone but I can’t set it up because I can’t get an OTP on my Pakistani SIM card.”
A night earlier, Nooh broke the Commonwealth record in the men’s +109kg final when he lifted a total weight of 405kg to leave other competitors in the shade.
“The aim from the start was to get gold at these games,” said Nooh, referring to his bronze at the previous edition of the quadrennial spectacle at Australia’s Gold Coast. “I just put in everything I had.
“It’s the fruit of labour … the hard work we put in to train,” he added. “It’s a tough regimen and you have to train three hours twice each day to keep yourself fit and focused.”
Weightlifting runs in the family for Nooh. His father, Ghulam Dastagir Butt, is a 16-time national champion while his brother, Hanzala, also competed at the Games on Wednesday in the -109kg final in but couldn’t bring home a medal.
“I wanted to do it for my father … I’d promised him I’ll win gold,” informed Nooh. “I called my family as soon as I’d won. They told me they were watching me on television. It was an emotional moment for me.”
Emotions reached a crescendo for Nooh when Pakistan’s national anthem was played with him on the top of the podium. “It’s a feeling you can’t put in words,” he recalled.
Nooh, however, has another event to take part in before he sees his family.
Editorial: Commonwealth triumph
“We’re going to Turkey from here for the Islamic Games [which begin from Aug 9],” said Nooh. “I’d like to go home with another gold medal from there.”
Nooh’s performance was so strong that silver medallist David Andrew Liti of New Zealand, who had won gold last time out with a total lift of 403kg, said afterwards he was looking forward to facing off against the Pakistan weightlifter and beat him.
Things were more cordial with bronze medallist Gurdeep Singh with Indian media reporting and quoting Nooh that the duo danced to the beats of rapper Sidhu Moosewala, who was assassinated in May.
“Oh no sir, I’m from a Muslim country … I don’t dance,” Nooh said, with a bit of mischief in his tone.
The interview then shifted to more pressing matters, including Nooh’s bid to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympics after injury saw him miss out on Tokyo last year.
“The Olympics are the pinnacle and the goal is to qualify for Paris and win there,” Nooh said, adding that he and the country’s other weightlifters needed more support to win medals on the biggest stage.
“Gurdeep has been here in England for the last two months to train and acclimatise but we were here only seven days before the competition.
“Back in Pakistan, there is no training facility, nor any hall of international standard where competitions can be held. Equipment too isn’t up to the mark.
“I’ve got here because of my father’s passion for the sport. It was he who made sure we were able to train with the best equipment. But we need more support going forward.”
For now, Nooh is in line for a cash reward from the government. There might even be a dam named after him, as suggested by Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif in a cheeky exchange on social media where he was asked to do more in the weightlifter’s honour. Whether that will help Nooh achieve his Olympic dream remains to be seen.

1,"Notices to NA speaker, ECP over PTI resignations",Judge observes poll will have to be held while completing process of Riaz's removal but no other candidate running for the post.,"ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued notices to the National Assembly speaker, its secretary and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday on a petition filed by the PTI against “piecemeal” acceptance of its lawmakers’ resignations.
The PTI has argued that the resignations of all its 123 MNAs had been accepted months ago and the present National Assembly speaker had no “lawful authority or jurisdiction” to verify the resignations as former deputy speaker Qasim Suri had already approved them.
All PTI lawmakers, except dissidents, resigned en masse on April 11, two days after former prime minister Imran Khan was ousted from the top office after losing a confidence motion in parliament.
Later that month, Mr Ashraf decided to verify the resignations of the 123 PTI lawmakers by calling them individually or in small groups, but they couldn’t show up after party chief Imran Khan barred them from appearing before the speaker.
On July 27, National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf accepted the resignations of only 11 PTI lawmakers, including Dr Shireen Mazari, Ali Muhammad Khan and Farrukh Habib.
During the hearing on Thursday, PTI’s counsel Faisal Chaudhry submitted the copy of Mr Suri’s approval of resignations to the IHC acting chief justice.
The court issued notices to the National Assembly speaker, its secretary and the ECP, and set the next hearing for Aug 16.
The PTI petition said 123 MNAs gave their resignations on April 11 after the PTI’s parliamentary party meeting presided over by Mr Khan in a committee room at Parliament House. However, the present speaker withheld these resignations and did not forward them to the ECP on the pretext of “so-called verification”, it said.
“Now after the lapse of around three and a half months, the National Assembly speaker has approved resignation of only 11 MNAs of the PTI” and forwarded them to the election commission, which had de-notified the lawmakers, it said.
The party requested the court to direct the speaker to accept all resignations at once. Similarly, ECP should also be directed to denotify all PTI lawmakers en masse.
Raja Riaz’s removal
Also on Thursday, the Lahore High Court directed the NA speaker to take a decision within 30 days on an application requesting the removal of Leader of the Opposition Raja Riaz.
Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabbir, while taking up the case, wondered how the system would function if members of the assembly sat outside parliament and how one could oppose while sitting outside parliament.
He observed that parliament would have to conduct the election for the post opposition leader while completing the procedure in accordance with the law, but there was no other candidate in running, except Raja Riaz.
When the judge asked what the Constitution said when there was only one candidate before the NA speaker, the additional attorney general replied that the speaker fixed a day for the nomination of the NA opposition leader immediately after the contest for the premier and that the speaker nominated Raja Riaz through all due processes.
The court remarked that the petitioner was not a member of parliament and asked whether an ordinary citizen could file a complaint or not.
During the proceedings, petitioner Munir Ahmed’s counsel Advocate Azhar Siddique informed the court that an application had been submitted earlier to speaker for removal of the opposition leader, but no action was taken. Raja Riaz was holding this position without the consent of his party (i.e. PTI), he argued.
He claimed that the nomination of Raja Riaz as opposition leader was in “sheer violation” of rules 39, 43 and others of the ‘Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007 (“the Rules”)’.
Advocate Azhar argued that all resignations recently presented in the National Assembly were not accepted and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had not de-notified them.
Referring to a case, he said the IHC chief justice had held: “It is an admitted position that Dr Shireen Mazari continues to enjoy the status of a member of the Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament). She has not been de-notified by the Election Commission of Pakistan nor has the worthy Speaker of the National Assembly accepted her resignation in accordance with the principles and law highlighted by a division bench of that court.”
The counsel contended that the order clearly stated that the resignations had not been accepted by the NA speaker nor had the ECP de-notified the said members.
“If the said practice was not completed in accordance with procedure, then how is the respondent, Raja Riaz, appointed as the opposition leader?” he asked.
The court directed the NA speaker to decide the application seeking removal of the opposition leader within 30 days and adjourned the hearing till next date.
