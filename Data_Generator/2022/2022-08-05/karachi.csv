This year too, the AKU-EB awarded one national level position for SSC and HSSC qualifications each, and provincial level overall and group-wise top three positions for both SSC and HSSC. 
Ahmed Wali from Aga Khan Higher Secondary School, Gilgit, achieved National Level Overall First Position in HSSC and Wareesha Khan from Sindh achieved National Level Overall First Position in SSC.
Young Ahmed Wali noted: “AKU-EB does not assess students’ rote memorisation, no matter how much you try to memorise books. It is the conceptual learning I focused on when preparing for the examinations. AKU-EB has not constrained me to the textbooks, it has taught me how to live.”
Wareesha Khan, national high achiever from Sindh, said: “I feel fortunate to be a part of the AKU-EB education system. I was assessed for my intellectual ability, for conceptual learning and not for memorising the information given in the books.”
For the HSSC qualifications, the first positions at the provincial level were awarded to Ahmed Wali from Gilgit Baltistan, Sana Muftah from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Saleha Abid from Sindh, and Bareera Nasir Ahmad from Chenab Nagar.
For the SSC qualifications, the first positions at the provincial level were awarded to Haseeba Yousaf from GB, Aliya Shah from KP and Kashifa Asif from Chenab Nagar.
According to the Sukkur IBA Public School Principal Dr Ali Gohar Chang: “AKU-EB is about high-quality examination and assessment. It has been working as a driving force for improving quality education across Pakistan. We are fortunate that our SSC and HSSC students are performing well under the AKU-EB system. It is a way for us to know that our quality of teaching learning is at par with international standards.”
The board also recognised the collective efforts and partnership with its affiliated schools and found it critical in the successful performance of its schools across Pakistan. 
The board in its press release said, “This year, the Korangi Academy has shown exceptional performance in the AKU-EB annual examinations.”
According to Ms Asma Nasir, the principal of Korangi Academy: “For our school, it is a historical day. Our students’ national level achievement reflects the work of the Board with its affiliated schools, especially in the areas of teaching, learning and assessment. AKU-EB has opened the horizon of success for our students.”
AKU-EB CEO Dr Shehzad Jeeva noted: “AKU-EB students have demonstrated a phenomenal performance. Our high standards and academic rigour have prepared our students to compete globally. I am proud to see that AKU-EB students have reached more than 100 international universities, and more than 53 per cent of students enter top 15 universities in Pakistan.”

5,PTI moves SC for empowered LG system ahead of Aug 28 polls in Sindh,"Plea emphasises that without meaningful devolution of powers, proposed elections LG will be rendered a meaningless ritual.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Thursday challenged before the Supreme Court the July 6 Sindh High Court (SHC) verdict of refusing to delay the local government elections, and sought immediate compliance of the apex court’s Feb 1 directions regarding an empowered local government system before Aug 28.
Polling for the second phase of the LG election in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions is scheduled to be held on Aug 28.
Senior counsel Salahuddin Ahmed, who filed the petition before the apex court in Islamabad, told Dawn that emphasis had been made in the petition that without meaningful devolution of powers for the empowerment of elected local governments by the Sindh government and implementation of democracy at the grass-roots level as directed by the Supreme Court, the proposed elections for local government in Sindh will be rendered a meaningless ritual and would not comply with the mandate of Article 140-A of the Constitution.
The petition, moved jointly by PTI lawmakers Rabia Azfar Nizami and Sidra Imran, cited the Sindh government and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) as respondent.
The petition argued that the scheme of Article 140-A (1) (2) of the Constitution and the Feb 1 judgement of the apex court necessitated a prior and meaningful devolution of political, administrative and financial powers to local governments before elections were held.
“It is both the right and duty of political parties and their candidates to understand exactly what are the political, administrative and financial powers, responsibilities and resources of the office they are contesting elections for. Only once they have clarity on that, can the political parties select the best candidate for the job and prepare their manifestos and design their campaign accordingly,” the petition argued.
“Similarly, it is the right of voters to properly understand the role and functions of the office they are voting for and choose the appropriate candidate for the job. Elections to offices that presently possess no real power do not excite public interest and have low electoral turnout,” the petitioners said, adding that such a state of affairs invariably favours the ruling party in Sindh which was possessed of all the advantages of incumbency.
“As such, by rushing ahead with elections without first making the legislative amendments required to devolve political, financial and administrative power to local governments — the value of the elections themselves has and is being undermined,” the petition contended.
The petitioners argued that the Supreme Court through its Feb 1 judgement had ordered to amend a number of provincial laws, which had wrongly vested powers essentially belonging to local governments in the hands of provincial government.
“But not a single amendment has been made to any of these laws,” the petition regretted. 
They added that despite the elections, the newly elected local government representative would be devoid of any meaningful power or responsibilities and waste the majority of their term just trying to wrest their due powers, responsibilities and resources from the clutches of the provincial government.

6,Mystery shrouds Russian-made grenade that exploded in Karachi armoury,Police doubt grenades part of armoury’s inventory; inquiry under way to ascertain how blast took place.,"KARACHI: Mystery shrouds Wednesday’s grenade explosion outside a police armoury in Garden Police Headquarters as investigators on Thursday found 68 more grenades stored there but all of them were made by the Pakistan Ordinance Factory and not Russian made.
While police claimed that the grenades kept at the armoury were for fighting terrorists and criminals/kidnappers in Katcha areas of the province, there was no explanation as to how the two Russian-made grenades — one of which went off on Wednesday — ended up there. 
On Wednesday morning, Constable Shehzad and Cobbler Sabir were killed while Sub-Inspector Saeed and Constable Ali Gohar critically injured when one of the two Russian-made grenades, RGD-1, exploded outside the police armoury.
South-DIG Sharjil Kharal said that an inquiry was under way to ascertain as to how the incident occurred there. He said a special team had been constituted for ascertaining facts/inquiry of the explosion. 

Police doubt grenades part of armoury’s inventory; 68 POF-made hand grenades rust away

On Thursday, the DIG clarified that the grenades were part of equipment/ammunition for protection of police and fighting against criminals. He added that they were not ‘case property’. 
Another police officer, who wished not to be named, said that the wounded policemen were not in a position to talk to the inquiry team and tell them exact circumstances that led to the explosion.
He said that not only grenades but mortar shells had also been kept there for fighting criminals, particularly dacoits/kidnappers in Katcha area of Sindh as the armoury at the Garden Police Headquarters dealt with arms and ammunition for the whole province. 
The officer hinted that some of the grenades stocked at the armoury dated back to 2014. 
As the explosion took place outside the armoury and across the road, the officer said they were also looking into the possibility as to whether the grenades were brought from outside or taken from the armoury. 
68 grenades, 266 mortar shells ‘defused’ 
The Bomb Disposal Unit of Special Branch in their post-blast report on Wednesday identified presence of 68 hand-grenades and 266 mortar shells at the armoury and suggested their “demolition” by Pakistan Army as the same were in ‘rustic and dangerous condition’. 
According to the BDS report reviewed by Dawn on Thursday, the bomb experts had inspected 68 grenades, ME-36 made-in Pakistan Ordinance Factory, which were in “rusted/dangerous condition, metal body colour brown/complete”. 
The report said that all the grenades required to be demolished.
The report added that the technical experts of Special Branch also inspected 266 mortar shells and found that all these shells were in ‘old and dangerous condition’. 
The experts recommended that these shells also required demolition and handed over to Pakistan Army for safe demolition. 
Meanwhile, DIG-South Kharal claimed that the 68 grenades stocked at the armoury had been ‘defused’ and the shells had also been made safe by the police’s technical experts.

9,Sudden change in college admissions policy upsets students,Students expecting high grades in Matric lost out on good colleges...,"KARACHI: The week has brought with it much trial and tribulation for students hoping to get into their choice of colleges after having completed their Secondary School Certificate (SSC) or Matric.  
The students were all taken by surprise when they found out that this year all college admissions in Sindh would be based on their class nine results instead of their class 10 results, which used to be the general norm.  
As a result of this, many students still waiting for their Matric Part-II results before applying to college didn’t even apply for admission into their choice of colleges. And most of those who did apply were confused about what marks or grades to put in the admission form and made many mistakes there. Finally, when compared to 2021 when some 176 colleges and higher secondary schools in Karachi gave admission to 120,000 students, this year only 82,000 admissions could take place within the given deadline.  

Students expecting high grades in Matric lost out on good colleges

It is for the first time in the history of the province that something like this happened and it happened because Director General of Colleges Dr Mohammed Ali Manjhi was unable to inform everyone about the change in the admissions policy.  
He had taken the decision to rely on Matric Part-I results in good faith, to save everyone’s time when applying to colleges. But it all backfired because of his office’s failure to inform the students about it. 
Even though after realising the adverse repercussions of the change in college admissions policy (CAP), Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah had issued directives to extend the deadline for the admissions to ensure that all students get into college, things are still not going the students’ way.  
Many students expecting good marks in Matric Part-II lost out on the good colleges because they were judged on their Part-I exams.  
And what to talk about them when even those students who did well in class nine and filled their forms in time have been dealt with carelessness.  
Young Sawaiz Siddiqui, who had 86 per cent marks in class nine, filled his CAP form online. In his five college choices, he put in Adamjee College as his top choice but he was admitted to S.M. Science College, which he had put in as his fifth and last option.  
“I had put in Adamjee College as my first choice and a few others too, which were close to where I live. But I have been put into a college which is very far from where I live,” he told Dawn.  
“I visited the college with my father today and turns out that it is far away from my home. It took us one and a half hours to reach there. And by the time we reached, the college had closed, too,” he informed dejectedly.  
Another student, Ahsan Tariq, had even a worse experience because he was given none of the colleges he had put in his form despite 82 per cent marks in class nine.  
And Salman Ahmed, yet another student wronged, was shocked to find out that he had been put into a college that does not even cover his subjects. The boy is a pre-engineering student. But CAP decided to send him to Commerce College again while ignoring all his five choices.

10,Issue of drug use among students echoes in Sindh Assembly,"Education dept received no complaint about sale, use of narcotics in educational institutions, PA told...","KARACHI: Provincial Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah on Thursday told the Sindh Assembly that the government had not received any report or complaint about the use and sale of drugs in educational institutions, though there were news on social media and other sources of information about the menace with people expressing concern about it.
“This may not be mere speculation and there may be some truth in it, but according to the information we have received from schools, there is neither any report from the education department nor any formal complaint from anyone,” he added.
The education minister was replying to a call-attention notice moved by Rana Ansar of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), who drew the attention of the house towards the open sale and use of drugs and intoxicants in educational institutions, asking as to what action was being taken by the government to curb the menace.
Speaking on her notice, she said that drugs were being openly sold and used in the educational institutions. “It is very important to prevent it,” she said, adding that today children were getting addicted to drugs and drug addicts were seen sitting under bridges across the city all the time.

Education dept received no complaint about sale, use of narcotics in educational institutions, PA told

The MQM-P lawmaker said the use of drugs among students was reportedly rampant and regular drug parties were held in educational institutions.
The education minister said that it was a very important issue, but the education department had not received any report from any authorities, including police and law enforcement agencies.
However, he admitted that most of the reports of drug abuse related to private schools.
He said he had held a meeting with the representatives of private school owners in that regard, but they did not have any such complain in their respective institutions. “Nor did they [school owners] pointed out any other educational institution where such menace is prevailing,” he added.
Sardar Shah said the education department was not authorised to cancel the registration of a school where drugs were used as there was no provision of law. 
“There is no mentioning in the law that if a school is caught, then we can punish it and there is no determination of punishment either,” he said, adding that there was need of amendment in that regard.
Sardar Shah said the provincial government would bring amendment in the current laws to take action in that regard.
Martyrs paid tribute
The assembly unanimously adopted three clubbed resolutions to pay homage to six army men, including the corps commander of Southern Command, who embraced martyrdom in a helicopter crash in Balochistan, and lauded the Pakistan Army for standing beside the civilian administration during any disaster and calamity.
Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) Sharmila Faruqui and MQM-P’s Rana Ansar tabled the identical resolutions while Jamaluddin Siddiqui of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf moved another resolution.
Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari clubbed the resolutions since they were identical.
“The house expresses grief over crash of a military helicopter and subsequent martyrdom of six Pakistan Army officials, including the corps commander of Southern Command. The Pakistan Army has always defended the country against all odds, be it external threat or internal disturbance. Our army has also stood side by side with the civilian administration in the face of natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and have never shunned from sacrificing their lives as well,” one of the resolutions read.
Speaking on the resolution, the lawmakers also expressed solidarity with the families of the martyred soldiers and prayed for their eternal peace.
Ms Faruqui said the Pakistan Army had always stood for relief operation in any disaster.
PTI’s Jamal Siddiqui said the soldiers and officers had martyred while serving the humanity. “Our army always plays the role of vanguard during the calamity and disasters in the country.
Terming the incident a great tragedy for the country, Rana Ansar of the MQM-P said the gap could never be filled. The MPA, whose husband was also killed in a PIA plane crash in May 2020, said she could better feel the pain of the bereaved families of the army men.
Investigation demanded
Shamim Mumtaz of the PPP said the martyrdom of army personnel, including senior officials, was a great loss and matter of great concern for the nation. She said that a thorough investigation must be conducted in the air crash of army officers.
PPP’s Dr Sohrab Sarki and Ghazala Sial, PTI’s Adeel Ahmed and MQM-P’s Mangla Sharma also spoke on the resolution before Deputy Speaker Rehana Leghari put it in the house for approval.
The members of both sides of the aisle unanimously adopted the resolution, giving standing ovation to the martyrs.
The house was adjourned to Friday (today) at 10am.

Titled Reporting on climate change: Making the invisible visible, the two-day event was jointly organised by the Centre for Excellence in Journalism (CEJ) and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
The event was aimed at building technical knowledge and skills of journalists and promoting responsible and inclusive reporting.
Former minister for climate change Malik Amin Aslam, commenting on the need for a consolidated national response to climate change, said: “We have turned cities of gardens into cities of concrete. There are too many policies and negligent implementation. We need to move towards clean, nature-based solutions to this crisis.”

Journalists urged to highlight local impacts of climate change

The workshop allowed participants to learn about disaster risk reduction and management, politics and science of global climate change, and progress on the government’s national response to this phenomenon. 
Experts pointed out that climate change was deeply intertwined with local patterns of inequality and those already marginalised or in vulnerable situations faced disproportionate impacts of this crisis. 
They also warned that inaction on climate change would have serious consequences and urged reporters to connect climate science with local priorities. 
“If we do not control the average temperature by 1.5 degrees by the end of this century, two-thirds of our glaciers will disappear, for which no substitute is available,” said glaciologist Dr Sher Mohammad at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.
Journalist and lead trainer for the workshop Shahzeb Jillani  said it was imperative that we placed local communities at the heart of  our stories and highlighted the indigenous impacts of climate change  that were otherwise absent from the mainstream media coverage.
Karachi Urban Lab Director Dr Nausheen Anwar, Karachi Chief Meteorologist Sardar Sarfaraz and Maaz Tanveer also spoke.

THE Buddha-shaped object found at Mohenjo Daro. —Photo by writer

 
LARKANA: An object, believed to be of archaeological importance, has surfaced in the DK area of Mohenjo Daro during recent downpour and experts’ opinions are being sought to establish its make and age.
A private tourist guide, Irshad Ahmed Solangi, a resident of Dhand village located very close to the archaeological site, revealed on Thursday that he had found this object in a ditch, developed during the recent rainfall, a day earlier (Aug 3). He told Dawn that he reported the “discovery” to the site officer, Naveed Sangah. 
After examining the object, Mohan Lal, a former chief engineer of the department of archaeology and museums and currently working as project director of the Endowment Fund Trust (EFT), labeled the object as ‘Buddha Pendant’ and opined that it could be a unique antiquity. 
“This rare discovery demands further studies to find out missing history links,” he said. 
A senior officer of the culture department said the object appeared to be like a pendent worn by people around the neck. 
He said it could be a rare discovery of its nature at this site. It should be established by experts whether it was made up of bronze or some other material, he said, adding that they could also ascertain its historic or pre-historic value. 
When contacted, Naveed Sangah, the conservator at Mohenjo Daro, said the object was found by Irshad Solangi in the DK South area. 
“We have approached an expert working in the culture department to know about the object’s make and age,” he said.
Ali Haider Gadhi, a senior conservationist in the department, said that heavy rainfall led to the surfacing of this small figurine. 
The object is kept by Mr Solangi for the time being.
