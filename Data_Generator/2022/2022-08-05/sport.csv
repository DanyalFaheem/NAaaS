0,Shajar storms into 200m semis at CWG,"“Now, I’ll try my best to qualify for the final,"" he says.","BIRMINGHAM: There was no catching Shajar Abbas in his 200m heat at the Commonwealth Games on Thursday.  
Putting aside the disappointment of missing out on the 100m semi-finals by the narrowest of margins two days earlier, Shajar made sure he left nothing to chance this time.  
He won his heat at the Alexander Stadium in a time of 21.12 seconds to confirm his berth in Friday’s semi-finals. The final is scheduled for Saturday.  
“Now, I’ll try my best to qualify for the final,” Shajar told reporters.  
Shajar had missed out on the 100m semi-finals after finishing fourth in his heat. With the top two in each heat of that event advancing alongside the seven who posted the best times, the 22-year-old missed out despite having a better time than one athlete who qualified.  
For the 200m, the top two in each of the eight heats were to qualify for the semi-finals along with the next eight fastest sprinters and Shajar was one of eight winners on Thursday.  
At the 100m mark, Shajar trailed Nigerian Udodi Chudi Onwuzurike — the World Under-20 champion — and Abdul Rasheed Saminu of Ghana.  
But then he put on his afterburners, pulling level with Saminu by the 150m mark and then overhauling Onwuzurike in the last 25 metres, beating the Nigerian by 0.06 seconds at the finish line. Saminu was third in 21.32.  
Overall, Shajar — who holds a national record of 20.87 in the 200m — was 12th among the 57 sprinters who finished and he will be up against a top field in the semis.  
Four years after being disqualified in the last edition on Australia’s Gold Coast for impeding a rival before crossing first in the 200, England’s Zharnel Hughes posted the fastest men’s heat time of 20.30.  
Trinidad and Tabago’s Jareem Richards, who was promoted to the gold medal on the Gold Coast after being impeded by Hughes, qualified fourth fastest in 20.68.  
Pakistan’s athletes were basking in the afterglow of their first medals at the Games on Thursday after weightlifter Nooh Dast­agir Butt won the men’s +109kg final and judoka Shah Hussain Shah bagged bronze in the -90kg event the previous night.  
The men’s doubles squash team of Nasir Iqbal and Tayyab Aslam were also victorious on Thursday at the University of Birmingham.  
The Pakistan duo swatted aside Ghanaians Evans Ayih and Clement Anafo 11-1, 11-1 in 12 minutes to reach the round of 16.  
Over in the badminton court at the National Exhibition Centre, Pakistan saw two of its players fall in the round of 32.
Mohammad Irfan Saeed Bhatti proved no match for fifth-seeded Malaysian Yong Tze Ng as he fell 21-10, 21-9 in the men’s singles.
His compatriot Ghazala Siddique exited the women’s singles competition after losing to Tahila Richardson of Jamaica 21-14, 21-15. 
On Friday, Shajar will not be the only athlete Pakistan will have its eyes on. 
Fahad Khawaja, the country’s number one table tennis player, will be up against England’s Paul Drinkhall for a spot in the last 16. 
Fahad was imperious as he swept through the group stage on Wednesday night, winning all his three matches. 
He opened with a 4-0 victory over Guyana’s Christopher Franklin and then beat Mohtasin Ahmed of Bangladesh 4-1 before wrapping up Group 15 by cruising past Darren Douglas of Trinidad and Tobago.

1,Thompson-Herah wins 100m as Titmus stars in pool,BIRMINGHAM: Olympic 100m champion Elaine Thompson-Herah cruised to Commonwealth gold on Wednesday as Australia’s...,"BIRMINGHAM: Olympic 100m champion Elaine Thompson-Herah cruised to Commonwealth gold on Wednesday as Australia’s Ariarne Titmus completed a stunning individual freestyle treble on the last night of swimming action.
Elsewhere on the second day of track and field action in Birmingham, England’s Katarina Johnson-Thompson claimed her first heptathlon title for three years as she retained her crown.
Jamaica’s Thompson-Herah finished a disappointing third behind compatriots Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson in the 100m at last month’s world championships in Eugene, Oregon.
But she was the only one of three in the field at the Alexander Stadium and she made no mistake, crossing the line in 10.95sec to win the title for the first time.
“Feeling good,” said the 30-year-old.  “I didn’t have the best execution but nevertheless I had to dig for that one but I am still grateful to win my first Commonwealth Games.”
Johnson-Thompson ended her drought since the 2019 world championships by racking up 6,377 points in the heptathlon to finish 144 points clear of Northern Ireland’s Kate O’Connor.
“It feels incredible to do that in front of my home crowd,” said the 29-year-old, who finished a disappointing eighth at the world championships.
“It was the crowd who got me through the competition, especially the 800m when the noise was so loud.
“You know when you feel pain, you didn’t feel it, so I have got them to thank for that performance.”
Kenya’s Ferdinand Omanyala won the men’s 100m in a time of 10.02 while Scotland’s Eilish McColgan emulated her mother Liz McColgan in winning the women’s 10,000m.
On the final night of action at the Sandwell Aquatics Centre, 400m world record holder Titmus beat a high-class field after her earlier triumphs in the 200m and 800m freestyle.
The 21-year-old dominated the race, touching in 3min 58.06sec to see off the challenge of Canada’s 15-year-old Summer McIntosh.
The Olympic 200m and 400m champion skipped the world championships in Budapest in June, where she would have faced US star Katie Ledecky, to focus on the Commonwealths.
She leaves Birmingham with four golds in total after being part of Australia’s winning team in the women’s 4x200m freestyle relay.
“I came here with the goal to win all four. I believed I had the capacity to do that and I’m happy I did,” she said.
Titmus said it was crucial to have race practice in a high-pressure situation.
“I think that, back home, Australia really prides itself on success in the pool at the Comm Games,” she said.
“Potentially there’s more pressure here to win than at the Olympics sometimes because we are so dominant. Performing under that pressure is tough.”
England’s Ben Proud won his third straight Commonwealth men’s 50m freestyle title, dominating the field to win in 21.36sec.
“It’s a year ago since I was giving my interviews and burst into tears because of a bad swim at the Olympics,” said the world champion, who also won the 50m butterfly in Birmingham.
“So much has changed. This is really my redemption year. Something has clicked.”
Emma McKeon won a record-extending 20th Commonwealth medal as Australia brought the swimming events to a close by winning the women’s 4x100m medley relay.
The 28-year-old has won six gold medals in Birmingham to take her overall tally of golds to 14.
England’s Olympic 200m freestyle champion Tom Dean finally got his hands on a gold medal after six silvers, touching 0.08sec ahead of Australia’s Kyle Chalmers in the men’s 4x100m medley relay.
Australia finished with 25 swimming gold medals out of a total of 52, with the overall tally including swi­mming and para-swimming events.
Elsewhere on day six of the Games, England’s Georgina Kenn­edy beat Canada’s Hollie Naughton in four games to win the women’s squash final.
New Zealand’s Paul Coll won the men’s event, beating Joel Makin of Wales in a five-game nail-biter.
New Zealand also took gold and silver in the men’s cross-country mountain biking, with Samuel Gaze just edging out Ben Oliver while England’s Evie Richards won the women’s event.

2,"Two Sri Lanka athletes, one official go missing","A wrestler, judoka, and judo coach have disappeared from one of the Com­m­onwealth Games villages housing athletes and officials.","BIRMINGHAM: The Sri Lankan team management has asked its athletes and officials at the Common­wealth Games to turn in their passports after three members went missing.
The nation, which is experiencing a major economic crisis, confirmed late Wedne­sday that a wrestler, a judoka, and a judo coach have disappeared from one of the Com­m­onwealth Games villages housing athletes and officials.
Sri Lankan team spokesperson Gobinath Sivarajah told The Telegraph in India that Birmingham police are investigating the absence of the three members.
“We have asked all athletes and officials to submit their passports to our respective venue officials in all the villages after the incident,” he said. “The police are investigating and the three cannot cross the UK borders. What has happened is really unfortunate.”
At the 2018 Games on Australia’s Gold Coast, alm­ost one-third of the Came­r­oon team went missing after the event. Rwanda’s weightlifting coach also fled during a toilet break at the host stadium.
It was reported at least 230 athletes and officials lodged applications for protection vis­as in Australia after the ev­e­nt, but the majority were denied.
Sri Lanka, which picked a 161-strong contingent for the 2022 Games, had a silver and two bronze medals — including Yupun Abeykoon’s third place finish in the men’s 100m final on Wednesday — after six days of competition.

3,Haaland’s debut headlines opening weekend of Premier League season,"The Norwegian is expected to further strengthen Pep Guardiola’s side, who have won the title in four of the last five seasons.","MANCHESTER: Arsenal’s trip to Crystal Palace lifts the curtain on the new Premier League season on Friday, with Erling Haaland’s debut in the English top flight the highlight of the weekend as champions Manchester City travel to West Ham.
Haaland has been the marquee arrival to the Premier League from over 1 billion ($1.2 billion) spent on transfer fees ahead of the new campaign.
The Norwegian is expected to further strengthen Pep Guardiola’s side, who have won the title in four of the last five seasons.
However, Haaland and City’s season did not get off to a good start as perennial title rivals Liverpool won the Community Shield 3-1 last weekend.
A trip to the London Stadium is a good early season test of City’s revamped squad with Julian Alvarez and Kalvin Phillips also coming in to replace the departed Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fernandinho, Raheem Sterling and Gabriel Jesus.
The Hammers have also strengthened with the signing of Italian international striker Gianluca Scamacca as David Moyes’ men look to close the gap on the top four after qualifying for Europe in the past two seasons.
“We know what the standard is and we will reach the standards as quickly as possible and maintain what we have done always,” said Guardiola.
“I don’t feel, because we know each other well, that we are far, far away.
“But the games against West Ham and after Bournemouth will dictate our level and what we have to do.” 
CHELSEA ‘NOT READY’
Chelsea’s visit to Everton on Saturday pits together two sides who have reason to fear the season ahead at different ends of the table.
The start to Chelsea’s new era under the ownership of Todd Boehly’s consortium has not gone smoothly with manager Thomas Tuchel blaming an exhausting schedule on a pre-season tour to the US and a lack of signings for feeling  “not ready” for the new season.
Tuchel is also unhappy with a number of key players, including captain Cesar Azpilicueta, still looking to leave the club before the end of the transfer window.
Chelsea were thrashed 4-0 in pre-season by Arsenal in Orlando, but Everton suffered an even more embarrassing 4-0 defeat to Minnesota United on their tour to the States.
After narrowly surviving last season, the Toffees have since sold Richarlison to Tottenham.
But Everton have beaten Chelsea on each of the Londoners’ last four trips to Goodison Park.
Should Chelsea fail to hit the heights they previously have under Tuchel, Manchester United will be one of the sides hoping to take their place in the top four.
A 4-0 thrashing at the hands of Brighton in May summed up a miserable season for the Red Devils as they finished sixth.
Erik ten Hag has the chance to make a good first impression as United boss when the Seagulls visit Old Trafford.
But hopes of a new dawn for United have been dashed by another difficult summer off the field.
Cristiano Ronaldo has made his desire to leave clear, but a buyer cannot be found for the five-time Ballon d’Or winner, while United’s prolonged chase of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong appears set 
to fail.
Fixtures: Friday Crystal Palace v Arsenal Saturday  Fulham v Liverpool, Bourne­mouth v Aston Villa, Leeds v Wolves,  Newcastle v Nottin­gham Forest, Tottenham v Southampton,  Everton v Chelsea Sunday Man Utd v Brighton, Leicester v  Brentford, West Ham v Man City.

4,Cricket to make case for 2028 LA Games this month,NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council will make a presentation to the Los Angeles Olympics organisers later...,"NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council will make a presentation to the Los Angeles Olympics organisers later this month in its bid for the sport to return to the Games after a gap of 128 years, sources told Reuters.
Cricket has been shortlisted for potential inclusion at the 2028 Los Angeles Games along with baseball-softball, flag football, lacrosse, breakdancing, karate, kickboxing, squash and motorsport.
Teams would play Twenty20 cricket — the sport’s shortest international format which has inspired the lucrative Indian Premier League and similar franchise-based competitions in other countries.
The host city can include any sport but needs approval of the International Olympic Committee.
The governing body is likely to take a final decision at the IOC session in Mumbai next year, said one of the sources which had direct knowledge of the matter.
Twenty eight sports feature in the initial programme announced by the 2028 Games organiser in December.
Cricket has not been played at the Olympics since its maiden appearance in the 1900 Games at Paris, where Britain beat a team of mostly English expatriates representing France by 158 runs to win gold.
Despite initial obstruction from the powerful English and Indian cricket boards, the game has started to gain entry to multi-sports gatherings around the world.
Women’s Twenty20 is being played at the ongoing Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and cricket will also part of the delayed Asian Games in Hangzhou next year.
It will also feature in the Africa Games in Ghana and the Southeast Asian Games in Cambodia next year.
Considering cricket’s low profile in the United States, many believe it has better chances of making the cut for the 2032 Olympics in Australia.
The ICC, however, is determined to grow the game in the United States — which is cricket’s third largest broadcast market after India and Britain due to the Indian and Pakistani diaspora. It believes the 2028 Olympics would make the perfect showcase.
Olympic sports remain in cricket’s shadow in the sub-continent, so the ICC has based its bid around cricket’s unrivalled popularity among the region’s billion-plus fans.
Women’s Twenty20 has already proven a big hit on its Commonwealth Games debut with a record 150,000-plus tickets sold.
“Being in multi-sport games, whether it is the Commonwealth Games or the Asian Games or the African Games, putting cricket into these multi-sport events is good for the growth of our game,” ICC chief executive Geoff Allardice told reporters last week.
Allardice was merely echoing the sentiments shared by several former players.
“Great to see T20 cricket in Commonwealth Games. Next destination — Olympics,” tweeted former India player Mohammad Kaif.

5,Rivals desperate to break Bayern’s Bundesliga stranglehold,BERLIN: Bayern Munich have dominated the Bundesliga for a decade and when the champions open their new season ...,"BERLIN: Bayern Munich have dominated the Bundesliga for a decade and when the champions open their new season against Eintracht Frankfurt on Friday few will be betting against them winning a record-extending 11th consecutive league crown.
Despite the departure of striker Robert Lewan­dowski, Bayern do not look weaker than last year having brought in French forward Mathys Tel, Dutch defender Matthijs de Ligt, striker Sadio Mane and Ajax Amsterdam duo Ryan Gravenberch and Noussair Mazraoui.
They have already won their first piece of silverware, beating RB Leipzig 5-3 on Saturday in the German Super Cup, and will go into the opener against Europa League champions Eintracht with their confidence high.
“I was in Leipzig and saw Bayern’s performance. One has to say that their attack was impressive,” said Hans-Joachim Watzke, CEO of Borussia Dortmund.
“They have an unusually good team, invested immense amounts of money and so they are the top favourites. Everyone apart from Bayern fans want to see Bayern not win the title,” Watzke told ARD television.
Runners-up last season, Dortmund’s own title hopes have suffered a major setback after Sebastien Haller, their replacement for elite striker Erling Haaland, was ruled out for months.
Haller joined last month but two weeks later the Ivory Coast international was sidelined following the discovery of a testicular malignant tumour that required surgery and now will need chemotherapy.
The Ruhr valley club, who also signed talented Germany forward Karim Adeyemi, will be looking for a replacement for Haller but that will not happen before their season-opener on Saturday against fellow Champions League club Bayer Leverkusen.
RB Leipzig coach Domenico Tedesco hopes his players will kick off the season against VfB Stuttgart on Sunday in the same manner they finished the second half of the last campaign.
Tedesco took over with Leipzig in the lower part of the table and led them to a fourth-place finish, as well as steering them to the German Cup, the club’s first major trophy.
Leipzig have also managed to hold on to Bundesliga Player of the Season Christopher Nkunku, despite several top European clubs interested in signing the France midfielder.
Leipzig have moved to tighten up at the back with the addition of Germany international David Raum.
“I can play in the Champions League here. You can win titles with this club as the German Cup showed last season,” Raum said.
“RB Leipzig is a big club with enormous prospects and a big future.”

Dynamo, who were second in Ukraine last season when the league was abandoned following Russia’s invasion, played the game in Lodz because of the ongoing conflict in their country.
Oleksandr Karavaev, the hero of Dynamo’s extra-time win away to Fenerbahce in the second round, again scored the decisive goal as he volleyed in after 28 minutes.
The Ukrainians will take a slender advantage to Austria for the second leg on Aug 9. The winners of the tie will likely face two-time European champions Benfica for a place in the group stage.
Norwegian champions Bodo/Glimt are on course for the play-off round following Wednesday’s 5-0 rout of Zalgiris Vilnius.

The inauguration ceremony featured national stars Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi and Aqeel Khan while Punjab Tennis Association secretary Rasheed Malik was also present at the occasion. 
The Nishtar Sports Complex has been home to just one tennis court, which was built a decade ago and was then declared a “state of the art” facility. However, it failed to host a single national level event in this period.
Now that the facility has been improved, it can potentially help many local tennis players to train regularly. Ais­am, Aqeel and fellow players Ushna Sohail and Noor Malik played exhibition matches following the inauguration.
“Sports Board Punjab has done its job by building world-class tennis courts, now it is the players’ job to work hard,” said Aisam.
“Young players were lucky as they are getting such good facilities which were not available to us in the past.”

World number 88 Saville ripped the seventh-ranked American in hot and humid conditions while Romanian third seed Halep retired with illness down 7-5, 2-0 to Anna Kalinskaya.
“I stayed really composed,” Saville said.  “I managed the energy really well. It was very hot. But I thought it’s hot for everyone so get on with it.” Polish second seed Hurkacz crashed out in his second-round match at the US Open hardcourt tuneup, falling to Finland’s Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4, 7-6 (7/3).
Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios of Australia defeated US 14th seed Tommy Paul 6-3, 6-4 to book a third-round date with US fourth seed Reilly Opelka.
World number 63 Kyrgios, whose most recent title came at Washington in 2019, broke to open and close the first set. Paul’s fourth double fault gave the Aussie a match point and his forehand shot beyond the baseline gave Kyrgios the victory in 85 minutes.
Saville booked a quarter-final match against Cana­dian qualifier Rebecca Mar­i­no, who beat Germany’s Andrea Petkovic 6-3, 3-6, 6-1.
The 28-year-old Russian-born Aussie won her only WTA title at the 2017 Connecticut Open but dispatched Pegula in 98 minutes for her second top-10 win of the year after downing Ons Jabeur at Indian Wells in March.
“Everyone’s attitude is I’m here to win the tournament and I’m no different,” Saville said.  “I’m playing really good tennis right now. I’m excited for more.” Saville fell to 627th in the world rankings after Achilles tendon surgery that sidelined her for most of last year. Now she’s into her third quarter-final of the year after Miami and Guadalajara.
Ruusuvuori, set to rise one shy of his career-high to 43rd in the world rankings, den­ied Hurkacz on all four break-poi­nt chances to adv­an­ce after one hour and 44 minutes.
“I just tried to hang in there and stay as tough as can,” Ruusuvuori said. 
His third-round foe will be Sweden’s Mikael Ymer, who ousted 15th seed Aslan Karatsev 6-4, 3-6, 6-4 after eliminating three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray in round one.
Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka ousted Aussie 11th seed Alex De Minaur 3-6, 7-6 (8/6), 6-2. The world number 96 will next face seventh seed Karen Khachanov.
US third seed Taylor Fritz beat Australia’s Alexei Popy­rin 6-4, 6-3 to book a third-round match against British 16th seed Daniel Evans.
World number 13 Fritz comes off a five-set Wim­bledon quarter-final loss to Rafael Nadal and two weeks in a boot with a stress fracture in his left foot.
“It has felt great. No pain at all. It’s a really good sign,” Fritz said.

Last season, the Parisians romped to the title with a 15-point advantage over second-placed Marseille despite Messi failing to impress, Neymar and Mbappe bei­ng unsettled and Sergio Ramos missing most of the campaign.
But their galaxy of stars look to have turned a corner and have shown a new lustre, evident on a pre-season tour to Japan and in last Sundays emphatic 4-0 Super Cup win over Nantes.
It suggests the chasm between PSG and the rest of Ligue 1 could be even bigger this season, despite a change of coach with Mauricio Pochettino replaced by Christophe Galtier.
“Once you are at PSG, you have an obligation to achieve results,” Galtier said on his arrival at the club last month.
“I’m very ambitious. I came to Paris to win. There are three domestic trophies: we have to win them. You have to break records.”  Galtier was the last coach to break PSGs hegemony when he took Lille to the title two seasons ago and will have to balance domestic dominance with their Champions League ambitions.
PSG begin their campaign at Clermont on Saturday with the first game of the Ligue 1 season on Friday when Olympique Lyonnais host promoted Ajaccio.
Lyon’s eighth place last season was their worst since 1996 but Dutch coach Peter Bosz has streng­thened his squad with the likes of Alexandre Lacazette, back from Arsenal, Bayern Mun­ich’s Core­ntin Tolisso and Nicolas Tagliafico of Ajax.
The club also have a new American owner, John Textor, who has promised supporters: We want to win titles here. We are going to show up and we are going to spend.
It significantly improves their chances of being able to challenge with the likes of Marseille, Monaco and Stade Rennes.
Marseille fired volatile coach Jorge Sampaoli and replaced him with former Croatia international Igor Tudor despite their second place finish last season.
Monaco, who were held at home on Tuesday by PSV Eindhoven in the first leg of their Champions League third qualifying round tie, have boosted their attack with two new signings.
Switzerland’s Breel Embolo has arrived from Borussia Moenche­ngladbach and Japan’s Takumi Minamino from Liverpool to assist Wissam Ben Yedder who scored 25 goals last season.
Rennes were fourth last season and are expected to repeat that attacking approach in this campaign.

12,Hendricks sets up South Africa win in Ireland T20 opener,BRISTOL: Reeza Hend­ricks hit his fourth successive Twenty20 fifty as South Africa defeated Ireland by 21 runs in...,"BRISTOL: Reeza Hend­ricks hit his fourth successive Twenty20 fifty as South Africa defeated Ireland by 21 runs in their series opener here at the County Ground on Wednesday.
Ireland, however, did not help their cause by bowling 13 wides — more than two extra overs.
Hendricks, who hit three half-centuries in the Proteas’ recent 2-1 series win over Eng­l­­and, top-scored with 74 in a total of 211-5 and shared a third-wicket partnership of 112 with Aiden Markram (56), Lorcan Tucker (78) and George Dockrell (43) kept Ireland in the hunt but when the pair were dismissed off successive balls their side’s hopes of victory went with them.
Death-bowling specialist Wayne Parnell proved his worth for all he was hit for six off the last ball off the innings by tailender Barry McCarthy as Ireland finished on 190-9.
Left-arm paceman Parnell returned figures of 2-36, stand-in Proteas captain Keshav Maharaj took 2-29 with his left-arm spin and leg-spinner Tabraiz Shamsi 2-37.
For Ireland, it was yet another case of close but not close enough as they suffered a seventh successive T20 defeat having been competitive against India, New Zealand and now South Africa this season.
Hendricks’s latest fifty came off 32 balls, including seven fours and a six, while Markram got to the landmark in 25 balls including six boundaries.The pair fell to consecutive deliveries, with leg-spinner Gareth Delany having Markram caught at deep square leg before Hendricks holed out to point.
South Africa’s attack largely kept Ireland in check but a sixth-wicket stand of 86 between Tucker and Dockrell gave the Proteas something to think about.
Tucker faced just 38 balls, including seven fours and five sixes. But he fell when skying Shamsi to wicket-keeper Quintonde Kock off the last delivery of the 17th over.
Ireland needed 42 off the final three overs and the very next ball saw Dockrell well caught by Markram, diving forward from long-off, as he hit out at Dwaine Pretorius.
South Africa suffered a setback before the match started, with captain David Miller ruled out by a back spasm, with fellow batsman Heinrich Klaasen taking his place in the XI.
Proteas fast bowler Kagiso Rabada had already been sidelined from both matches in a two-game series that concludes in Bristol on Friday with an ankle injury.
