1,"Labourer dies, 10 hurt as building being built in ‘haste’ collapses in Karachi","Police book builder, contractors over manslaughter.","KARACHI: A labourer was killed while 10 others were injured when a multi-storey under-construction building collapsed in Surjani Town in the early hours of Tuesday morning, officials said. 
Surjani SHO Shahid Baloch said the four-storey building fell down after midnight in Sector-4-D, near Green Bus terminus. 
Area people, police, Rangers and rescuers rushed to the spot and dug out 11 people from the debris and took them to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where Waryam, 27, died during treatment, added the SHO. 
He added that experts from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) would be in a better position to describe the exact cause of the collapse. 

Police book builder, contractors over manslaughter

However, it was certain that ‘substandard material’ was being used in the construction as side pillars and roofs weren’t properly fitted with iron rods in the pillars, he said. 
There were reports that the builder had not only accelerated the construction work after someone had challenged its legality before the Sindh High Court but also ‘pressurised’ labourers to stay there for day and night construction.
However, the area SHO said he could not confirm such reports. But, he conceded that labourers were living in the building as the 10 people injured were all labourers while the 11th person was a passer-by, who suffered minor injuries. 
He said that all the people buried under the debris were retrieved. 
The officer pointed out that around three-four truckloads of debris had been removed and more removal work was under way as it might take a few more days to clear the place. He said due to heavy rains, the debris removal work had been stopped. 
Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed said 11 injured persons were brought to the ASH with varying nature and degree of injuries. Two of them suffered serious head injuries. 
A Rangers spokesperson said that their personnel had joined rescue efforts and recovered the injured people from the debris. 
Meanwhile, a SBCA team reached the scene and carried out an inspection. 
Builder, four others booked for manslaughter
In the evening, the Surjani police lodged an FIR against the builder, two contractors and as many supervisors.
The case was registered on behalf of the state through police officer Abdul Khaliq under Sections 322 (manslaughter), 337-H(I) (punishment for hurt by rash or negligent act), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code against builder Mohammed Shoaib, contractors Abdul Majeed and Sadiq and supervisors Noman and Asad.
The FIR said the under-construction building collapsed due to use of substandard material and negligence of the builder and contractors. 
Besides the death of one labourer and injuries to others, three parked rickshaws and one car were also destroyed, while nearby buildings also damaged. Last month, a six-storey building in Moosa Colony collapsed a few hours after its residents vacated it. 
On July 13, a man was killed when a multi-storey dilapidated building collapsed in old city area of Lyari.

2,Court sets aside magistrate’s order to exhume Aamir Liaquat’s body,KARACHI: A sessions court on Tuesday set aside the order of a judicial magistrate regarding exhumation of the body ...,"KARACHI: A sessions court on Tuesday set aside the order of a judicial magistrate regarding exhumation of the body of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MNA Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain for a post-mortem examination to determine the cause of his death.
Additional Sessions Judge-II (East) Ghulam Mustafa Leghari passed this order on an application filed by Aamir Liaquat’s son and daughter, who had challenged the June 18 order of the judicial magistrate that allowed a citizen’s application to exhume their father’s body to ascertain the actual cause of his death.
Judge Leghari ruled in the order: “I am of the humble view that the trial court has committed material irregularity and illegality in passing impugned order dated 18.06.2022, which is illegal and is hereby set aside and instant revision application is hereby allowed.”
In his order, Judicial Magistrate Wazeer Hussain Memon had observed that the cause of the late MNA’s death was still uncertain, which itself had raised question about either it was natural or unnatural and could only be ascertained after exhumation of the body and its examination.
However, the lawmaker’s family claimed that the citizen, Ahad, on account of his previous political rivalry with the late MNA had filed the application for exhuming the body for an autopsy.
On Aug 6, the incumbent judge had granted an interim stay order against the magistrate’s order of exhuming the body for an autopsy.
Earlier, the MNA’s family had challenged the magistrate’s decision in the Sindh High Court that had also granted an interim stay against exhumation of the victim’s body.

The ECP rejected all objections raised by his rival parties against Mr Khan’s candidature.
The returning officers of NA-246 (Lyari in district South), NA-237 (district Malir) and NA-239 (district Korangi) accepted the nomination papers of the PTI chief.
Speaking to reporters, former Sindh governor and senior PTI leader Imran Ismail said: “Now the people will give their verdict in the next month by-polls by electing Imran Khan from all three constituencies.
“The parties of the imported government used every tactic to keep Imran Khan away from electoral process, but they have failed terribly. The results of the by-elections will be a reflection of the next general elections when the people of Pakistan would elect Imran Khan with two-third majority,” he claimed.

4,Police invoke rape charge in Karachi teenage girl’s ‘abduction’ case,Magistrate fixes Aug 20 for acceptance or otherwise of supplementary charge sheet.,"KARACHI: Police have invoked the charge of rape in a case pertaining to the alleged abduction of a teenage girl from Karachi and her illegal underage marriage in Punjab. 
Around 10 suspects have been charged with abducting the 15-year-old girl and shifting her to Punjab where her illegal child marriage was solemnised in April this year. 
On Tuesday, the investigating officer (IO) filed a supplementary charge sheet before Judicial Magistrate (East) Aftab Ahmed Bughio. 
The IO stated that the suspects had abducted the underage girl from her house in Shah Faisal Colony on April 16 and transported her to Lahore. He added that one of the suspects had disclosed his presence in the city on the day of the incident while the presence of the purported spouse of the teenage girl in the city was established from his call data record (CDR). 

Magistrate fixes Aug 20 for acceptance or otherwise of supplementary charge sheet

He added that during the course of investigation, the detained and absconding suspects were found involved in committing offences punishable under Sections 364-A (kidnapping or abducting a person under the age of fourteen), 363 (kidnapping), 368 (wrongfully concealing or keeping in confinement, kidnapped or abducted person) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 3(ii) of the Prevention of Trafficking in Person Act, 2018. 
The charge sheet added that detained cleric Hafiz Ghulam Ali, who had allegedly facilitated the girl’s underage nikah, and Ali Asghar, who was a witness of the marriage, were involved in committing offences punishable under Sections 3 and 4 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013. 
The IO also invoked Section 375(v) (rape with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age) of the PPC against the girl’s purported spouse despite the fact that his request for permission to shift the teenage girl, who was kept in a shelter home, to a hospital for medical examination was declined by a judicial magistrate, who had observed that the medical examination at this stage would “achieve nothing, but embarrassment and offend the victim”.
He requested the magistrate to accept the supplementary charge sheet and also sought time to arrest the absconding suspects and produce them before the court on the next date. 
Granting the request, the magistrate fixed the matter for Aug 20 for acceptance or otherwise of the supplementary charge sheet. 
Initially, a kidnapping case was registered at the Al-Falah police station on the complaint of victim’s father Syed Mehdi Ali Kazmi.

5,‘Karachi’s population was deliberately undercounted to keep status quo’,Pashto speaking population has increased from 8pc in 1981 to 15pc in 2017 in city...,"

Arif Hasan

 
KARACHI: Distinguished architect and town planner Arif Hasan on Tuesday discussed several unique aspects of Karachi and said that there was an impression that population of the country’s commercial capital was deliberately underrated in the 2017 population census to keep the status quo.
“There are many unique facets to Karachi. This is the only place in Pakistan where the political leadership and public questioned the 2017 census. According to an international organisation, in 2016 the city’s population was 22.8 million. An impression is that it was deliberately undercounted [in 2017] to keep the status quo,” he said.
Speaking at a seminar titled ‘Ownership of Karachi’ at the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) House, Mr Hasan said that Karachi was the biggest non-Sindhi-speaking city of a predominantly Sindhi-speaking province. 
The programme, moderated by PMA’s Mirza Ali Azhar, was organsised by the Concerned Citizens Alliance in association with the PMA.

Pashto speaking population has increased from 8pc in 1981 to 15pc in 2017 in city

Mr Hasan narrowed down his topic to ‘What the census tells us’ and said the census of a country gives us details of its population. It tells us about the overall social and economic conditions as well as about human settlements. But it doesn’t tell us about trends. Trends are seen by comparing old censuses to the latest ones. 
He said therefore, he and his team’s research took into account the censuses that happened in 1981, 1998 and 2017. Doing so, they also took into account a comparative analysis of Lahore and to some extent Delhi to get a clearer picture.
The architect said from 1981 to 1998 Karachi’s population increased by 260,000 per year, and from 1998 to 2017 the number shot up to 325,000 per year.
‘Sindh’s 60pc urban population lives in Karachi’
Continuing with the argument about the uniqueness of Karachi, Mr Hasan said 60 per cent of the urban population of Sindh resides in the city whereas in Lahore, with respect to the province of Punjab, it’s 27 per cent. “Karachi’s urban population is overwhelming,” he said. 
The mother tongue of 11pc of people living in Karachi is Sindhi while the mother tongue of 80pc of residents of Lahore is Punjabi. “Karachi is the largest non-Sindhi-speaking city of a predominantly Sindhi speaking province.” 
In the 1981 census, the Urdu speaking population in Karachi was 57.34pc, which decreased to 48pc in 1998 and in the 2017 census it further decreased to 42.30pc, he said, adding that the Pashto speaking population has increased the most from eight per cent to 11pc to 15pc (between the three census taking time periods). 
The Sindhi speaking population, too, has increased from six to seven and now 11pc. “If these trends continue, then the Urdu speaking population will keep decreasing and Pashto and Sindhi speaking people will keep increasing,” he said.
He then shifted his focus on marital status with the 15-24 age bracket considered to be the most important. 
He said the number of married women decreased considerably from 1981 to 1998 but then again increased in 2017 to 30.87pc, which means that a majority of women in Karachi comprises unmarried adolescents. The divorce rate has also gone up. 
In 1981 and 1998 Karachi compared to Lahore was doing better in the divorce rate [there were less divorces] but in 2017, Lahore’s numbers are better.
Lahore ahead of Karachi in female literacy rate
Shedding light on the subject of literacy, Mr Hasan said in 1981 Karachi fared better than Lahore but in 2017 the situation changed, as female literacy in Karachi in 2017 was 77.9pc whereas in Lahore it was 84.5pc. 
With regard to housing, among other things, he told the attendees that 34 to 35pc people in Karachi live in rented houses. In terms of utilities, from 1981 to 1998 the number of shared bathrooms and kitchens has come down from 19pc to 13pc. And access to potable water in Lahore has increased in comparison to Karachi.
After his address, Mr Hasan invited his team members Dhuha Alvi and Amal Hashim to talk about educational attainment and employment. The latter also pointed out the shortcomings in the 2017 census.
Architect and town planner Fazal Noor, an assistant professor at Sir Syed University, said vis-à-vis the original topic that we are not just looking at the population but also at the built up area which has been increasing.

6,Vets reschedule Karachi Zoo elephant’s surgery,Surgery delayed as two surgeons unable to arrive in city due to bad weather conditions.,"KARACHI: International experts currently visiting Karachi Zoo had to postpone the two-tusk operation of an elephant scheduled for Tuesday as two surgeons could not arrive in the city due to bad weather conditions.
“The team couldn’t arrive today as planned yesterday due to bad weather conditions in Turkey. They will now come on Wednesday [today] early morning,” Dr Aamir Khalil of Four Paws, a global animal welfare group, told Dawn.
He added that preparations had been made for the operation.
The surgery, experts say, is unique as it would be carried out under a ‘standing sedation’.
It might be recalled that Madhubala and Noor Jehan, the two female elephants housed in Karachi Zoo, have been suffering from damaged and infected tusks for several years, keeping them in constant pain.
The problem was first identified by Four Paws’ team, which was invited for examination of elephants last year following court’s intervention in the case.

7,Plan to improve immunisation coverage in eight UCs discussed,KARACHI: Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho held a meeting on Tuesday with experts and officials to discuss ways...,"KARACHI: Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho held a meeting on Tuesday with experts and officials to discuss ways to effectively engage private providers in immunisation and other areas of preventive healthcare. 
The meeting was attended by Aga Khan University’s senior project lead Dr Shehla Zaidi, other health experts associated with the university, health secretary Zulfiqar Shah and parliamentary health secretary Qasim Siraj Soomro. 
Talking about the benefits of engaging the private providers, Dr Zaidi explained that they could administer vaccine after business hours and there was more public trust towards the private providers as well, so their target base was wider. 
About the immunisation project being implemented by the AKU in collaboration with government assistance in the eight high-risk union councils (UCs) of the city, she said it would offer sustainable services since the varsity had that project. 
Dr Zaidi informed the meeting that the staff involved in the care of newborns would be registered and provided training under the project by the Extended Programme for Immunization (EPI) in order to ensure birth dose vaccines to newborns and their follow-up visits by parents to health facilities. 
Sharing her concerns, Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho said that bringing all birthing stations under immunisation coverage was the government’s priority goal and that the department needed external support in hiring and training more vaccinators, though it could provide the vaccines free of cost. 
“The EPI officials are working on extending their hours so as to better accommodate the working population that may not be able to access the health centres before 5pm,” she said. 
The minister also spoke about the gaps in communication and counselling and emphasised that this area needed to be more focused. 
“Parents must be informed what the vaccine is for and what its side effects can be. There must be proper counselling and feedback should be taken from the parents so that reasons for refusal could be properly registered and officials are able to make their strategies accordingly,” she noted, adding that effective counselling would ensure that parents return for follow-up vaccines for their children. 
It might be recalled that the Sindh EPI had signed an memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the AKU in March this year, targeting hotspots of immunisation refusals in eight UCs of Karachi to increase zero-dose vaccination provided at birth as well as Penta 3 vaccination in children under six months, which is a marker of complete vaccination in children under six months.

8,SHC allows appeal against conviction in terror financing case,"Bench terms evidence against appellant ‘unreliable, utterly deficient’...","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday overturned a conviction order of a trial court against a man in a terror financing case.  
The SHC observed that all the evidence came up on record was completely unreliable and utterly deficient to prove the charge against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.  
In December 2020, the ATC-XII had handed down 10 years in prison as well as other sentences to Ghulam Rasool Rabbani, said to be associated with banned Jamaat Ud Dawa (JuD), for collecting funds at a mosque/seminary in a Malir locality in November 2020 for alleged terrorist activities.  
The trial court had also ordered forfeit of the mosque/madressah with directions to the administrator of education assets of the education department to take it over as it belonged to the banned organisation.  

Bench terms evidence against appellant ‘unreliable, utterly deficient’

The convict through his counsel filed appeal in the SHC against the conviction order of the trial court and after hearing both sides and examining the record and proceedings of the case, the bench comprising Justice K. K. Agha and Justice Zulfiqar Ali Sangi allowed the appeal and set aside the conviction order.  
The bench in its judgement observed that the FIR was registered on the basis of an intelligence report (IR), but the IR was not produced by prosecution before the trial court nor it was established that who had prepared the IR and the same person was not called as a witness.  
It further noted that the appellant had not been named in the FIR and there was no allegation that he was collecting funds for the proscribed organisation.  
The bench stated that as per the IO, he had collected some documents from the wife of the appellant, residing adjacent to the mosque, but she was not produced before the trial court as witness while the IO did not collect any material to establish that the mosque in question belonged to any banned organisation or was being used by it.  
The IO had examined two private persons and only one of them was produced before the court as a witness and he had not disclosed a single word in his evidence that the appellant was collecting funds for JuD, it added.

In Larkana, it started raining heavily in the morning, inundating low-lying areas and main roads. The Met office recorded 35 millimeter rainfall in the city within 55 minutes, which caused gutters to overflow and pool rainwater before trade centres and hospitals.  
The rainwater also accumulated in two underpasses connecting the city with healthcare facilities and district and divisional offices.  
Lightning kills three farmers 
Two brothers and their cousin died and their father suffered serious injuries in Waqa Mori village near Wagan town, 20 kilometres from Larkana, after lightning struck them when they were busy planting paddy saplings in a field.  
The deceased were identified as Mohammad Ishaq Wako, 22, his brother Mohammad Khan, 18, and their cousin Mohammad Amin Waqo. Mohammad Rabban, father of the victims, was admitted to Chandka Medical College Hospital with severe burns, said villagers.  
The heavy downpour also lashed Qambar-Shahdadkot district where most of the roads and low-lying areas were submerged. Rainwater entered police station in Qambar town, forcing the staff to take shelter in nearby mosque.  
In Shahdadkot town, the heavy rain caused flooding in several localities and trapped inmates in flooded houses.  
The town residents said that huge stocks of wheat were lying in the open without proper cover in government warehouse and the continuous rain could damage the grain.  
Three dykes develop breaches 
Arzi Shakh, Sujawal Shakh and Soonharo Shakh developed breaches during heavy rain in Sujawal Junejo, Warah and Dost Ali areas in Qambar-Shahdadkot district.  
The breaches submerged recently planted paddy saplings on hundreds of acres land and submerged several paths to villages. Thull Shakh, an offshoot of Warah Canal, developed breach at RD-1 near Din Mohammad Jattak village. The breach was plugged late on Monday night, said the villagers.  
In another development, Balochistan irrigation authorities closed water gates at Grang Regulator [a water distribution point between Sindh and Balochistan], which led to abrupt rise in Saifullah Magsi branch that irrigates Sindh’s land. 
The sudden rise in the canal mounted pressure on its offshoots and tributaries, causing Qubo Shakh, Shahbaig and other branches to develop breaches, said villagers.  
Rain cuts off land link of 300 villages 
The heavy rain in Khirthar range, Kachho and Kohistan areas cut off land link of more than 300 villages in union councils of Tando Rahim Khan, Wahi Pandhi, Sawaro, Drigh Bala, Chhinni, Mitho Babar, Haji Khan, Chhinni, Shah Hassan and Buriro and Fareedabad with Johi town.  
Residents of Kachho complained that people in the marooned villages had started to face shortages of food, medicines and fresh water.  
It also rained in Dadu, Johi, Khairpur Nathan Shah and Mehar towns, cutting off land link of 20 villages in Sann and Manjhand talukas. Kohistan and Thana Bula Khan, Karchat and Thana Ahmed Khan in Jamshoro district also received heavy rain.  
Manchhar Lake rises 
The level of water in Manchhar Lake had risen to 115.1 feet RL (reduced level) due to continuous rain in torrents in Khirthar range and Kachho, hence 13,000 cusecs had been released from the lake into the Indus River to reduce pressure on the lake’s embankments, said Engineer Mahesh Kumar.  
It also rained in Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Tando Mohammad Khan, Matiari, Jamshoro and Tando Allahyar districts where intermittent spells of rainfall continued throughout the day.  
Mirwah Gorchani, Digri, Jhuddo, Naokot, Kot Ghulam Mohammad, Mir Ki Landhi, Jhilori, Sindhri, Phuladiyyoon, Hingorno, Patoyoon and Tando Jan Mohammad towns and adjoining areas also received heavy rain.

“This is a huge task which needs to be expanded to cover a large number of patients coming to the centre from far flung areas of Sindh, Balochistan and southern Punjab, besides Larkana district,” the commissioner said.
Mr Leghari went round units of the hospital and held a meeting with medical superintendent Dr Gulzar Tunio. He told Dr Tunio that he had discussed healthcare issues of Larkana division with the chief secretary, who agreed in principle to lend maximum possible support to CMCH initiatives.
The commissioner advised Dr Tunio to focus on compiling and updating the data of all disciplines at the hospital “as figures always speak”. 
It was learnt that the commissioner had asked the consultants serving at the CMC Children Hospital, as well as the CMCH management, to prepare long-term plans in health and medical education sectors for upgrading of the available services. He held out the assurance that required softwares would be made available to this over 1,500-bed healthcare facility for compiling of data of all departments.
During the visit, Prof Dr Zameer Soomro, the orthopedic surgeon who has been running this small unit since 2015, briefed the commissioner about its operation. He said philanthropists should be involved for funding on a permanent basis while the health department would also be approached to promote this noble cause. 
Prof Soomro, who has acquired this skill from US and heads the CMCH department of orthopaedic unit-II, called for recruitment of adequate skilled staff for the unit.
He said that doctors and other staff were deputed at the unit every week to attend 50 to 70 patients coming from upper Sindh, lower Punjab and parts of Balochistan. 
“We have registered a gradual rise in the number of patients with congenital club foot deformity at the unit … in 2015, 109 cases were reported and most of them came from villages and remote areas,” said Prof Soomro.
