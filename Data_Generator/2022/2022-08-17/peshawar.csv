0,Amn Jirga wants govt to criminalise enforced disappearances,Empowerment of civilian institutions in tribal districts also emphasised.,"PESHAWAR: The Pakhtun Qaumi Amn Jirga, a syndicate of Pakhtun political, nationalist and religious parties, on Tuesday demanded of the government to declare enforced disappearances a crime and empower civilian institutions in tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The jirga met at the Awami National Party’s headquarters, Bacha Khan Markaz, here and discussed the emerging law and order situation in the province.
Besides the ANP’s central and provincial leadership, PML-N provincial president and adviser to the prime minister on political and public affairs Amir Muqam, PPP leader Akhunzada Chittan, Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement chief Manzoor Pashteen, Jamaat-i-Islami leader Inayatullah Khan, National Democratic Movement leader Abdullah Nangial, parents of the Army Public School students martyred in the 2014 militant attack, teachers and journalists.
ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan told reporters afterwards that the participants demanded of the government to grant powers to civilian institutions in tribal areas and the law-enforcement responsibility to the police.

Empowerment of civilian institutions in tribal districts also emphasised

He said that the forum also called for the criminalisation of enforced disappearances as well as the production of all ‘missing’ persons in the courts of law.
The Amn Jirga condemned the registration of FIRs against the people, who, it said, peacefully protested the resurgence of militants in Swat region and demanded their immediate withdrawal.
Mr Aimal said that police cases against peaceful protesters showed that the state and militants were on the same page against the people.
He said that the implementation of the KP Actions (in aid of civil power) Ordinance, 2019, had literally suspended the Constitution in the province and thus, increasing the incidence of the rights violation alarmingly.
The ANP leader said that torture cells were established under that law for Pakhtuns.
He claimed that the provincial chief minister, ministers, a former governor and a former National Assembly speaker had made extortion payments to militants in the province.
He said that the Amn Jirga had called such payments to the killers of Pakhtuns a national crime and state terrorism.
Mr Aimal also demanded of the government to form a parliamentary committee to probe extortion payments made by the cabinet members and PTI leaders.
He said that the targeted killing of educated Pakhtun youths in the province was common and that the culprits were later declared ‘unknown killers’, which was unacceptable to the Amn Jirga, which declared the state responsible for those killings.
The jirga also demanded of the government to immediate release MNA Ali Wazir detained one and a half years ago and said that the state’s conduct towards the lawmaker was very revengeful.
The ANP leader said that MNA Ali Wazir was a strong voice against state terrorism and that his family had been ruined by militants.
He said that the Amn Jirga hailed the recent street protests in Waziristan, Dir, Swat and Mohmand and other districts of the province against the alleged resurgence of militants and hoped that the educated youth in the region would offer strong resistance in case militants resumed activities.

He said the the ceasefire with the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan was intact and no major terrorist incident had occurred that might have created mistrust between the group and the government.
The spokesman, however, said there were some groups, which were opposed to the TTP’s peace accord, so their involvement in the terrorism-related incidents in the province could not be ruled out.
“We [government] assure the people that there is nothing to worry as the provincial government will maintain its writ in the province at all costs and no compromise would be made on the solidarity of the country, safety of the people as well as maintenance of peace,” he said.
He added that reports regarding deteriorating law and order situation on social media were totally false and fabricated.

The biosphere reserve consists of 89,374 hectares that provides prime habitat for certain wild animals including snow leopard, Himalayan brown bear, Himalayan lynx, cape hare, Red Fox, Himalayan ibex and Tibetan wolf.
Barrister Saif also informed that the cabinet also approved to declare Shahi Nagar Ghoor Dara of Daggar sub-division of Buner as the community game reserve.
Barrister Saif said that the cabinet also approved the KP Factories Rules, 2022 to regulate the matters with regard to labour in factories of the province.
The cabinet also decided to withdraw its earlier approval with regard to the appointment of Manzoor Ahmad as the chief executive officer of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Transmission and Grid System Company and allowed the energy and power department to float fresh advertisement for the post under the laid-down procedure.
The cabinet also approved the minimum support price of wheat crop in the year 2022-23 as Rs2,600 per 40kg as worked out by the ‘cost production committee’ on the basis of a survey conducted throughout the province.
The minimum support price of wheat crop for the last year 2021-22 was Rs2,200 per 40kg. The recommendations of the provincial government will be shared with the federal Ministry of National Food Security and Research.
Barrister Saif said the cabinet approved the establishment of the Darul Aman Crisis Centre in place of the Working Women Hostel, Hayatabad, the KP Mines Rules, 2022, and the provision of 107 acres of land for the fencing of Mohmand Dam.

5,Covid-19 testing now mandatory for hospitalisation in KP,Province records three deaths in a single day due to virus.,"PESHAWAR: The health department made Covid-19 testing mandatory for patients before hospitalisation or undergoing surgeries as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recorded three deaths due to the virus for the first time during the current year in a single day.
A notification issued from the office of director-general health services on Tuesday said that each and every patient requiring admission in hospitals must be subjected to Covid-19 testing in view of the increasing positivity reported during the last couple of weeks.
The notification circulated to all medical teaching institutions, district headquarters hospitals, district health officers and medical superintendents also showed concerns over the low number of tests for Covid-19 and instructed them to enhance sample collection to ascertain true picture about prevalence of the infection in the province.
It said that average positivity of the virus remained 4.7 per cent over the past one week while the infectivity level in some districts was 10 per cent, which was alarmingly high. However, it said that high positivity could be also attributed to low testing in the province.

Province records three deaths in a single day due to virus

Asking for enhancement of sample collection, the letter said that at present on average only 1.3 contacts were traced for each positive patient, which was far below than the national guidelines that recommends that samples should be taken from 10 to 15 close contacts of a confirmed patient.
To know the exact scenario regarding Covid-19 positivity across the province, all the relevant officials have been directed to increase number of contact-tracing in their respective areas in line with the guidelines of National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC).
The letter said that it was decided at the highest level that patients should be admitted to hospital only after they underwent Covid-19 testing.
It said that people with respiratory problems and their attendants should also be screened for the virus to put brakes on the spread of the pandemic in the province. It said that all patients, who got hospitalised for all sorts of surgeries, should be tested. It added that all details of positive patients should be shared with the authorities.
Meanwhile, the province’s mortalities due to the pandemic rose to 6,339 with three new deaths recorded at Lady Reading Hospital, Peshawar. 
All the three deceased were above 65 years and had underlying health conditions.
A health department report said that 72 new patients were detected during the last 24 hours, making the province-wide tally of infections 222,539. 
Of the affected people, 215,479 patients, including 70 recorded during the last 24 hours, have recovered.
Currently, there are 721 active patients in the province including 379 in Peshawar, the epicentre of the virus, which has recorded half of total deaths and cases in the province.
Officials said that 2,593 tests were conducted in the province. They said that the department wanted to process at least 7,000 samples on average per day to be able to know the presence of virus.
They said that the low number of tests was a matter of concern because it created doubts about the existence of the pandemic. If a district processes 10 samples and half of them turn out positive, it means positivity in that district is 50 per cent. 
“Already, we have established over a dozen PCR laboratories in different districts that are capable of conducting more than 500 tests per day,” said officials.
The health department has enough quantity of Universal Transport Media (UTM), a tube which contains preservative to transport nasopharyngeal swab to reference laboratory safely. Without UTM, samples are not accepted by PCR. Besides, Rapid Antigen Test is also available abundantly. 
“This test is conducted in all hospitals and in field or homes, bus stands, stadiums and tourist spots which gives result within 10 minutes,” said officials.

A single-member bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan observed that on tentative assessment of the available record, petitioner Aslam Khan was prima facie connected with the commission of the offence.
The bench observed that the offence also fell within the prohibitory clause of section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as such the petitioner was not entitled to the concession of bail.
The FIR of the occurrence was registered at Karora police station in Shangla district on June 29 under sections 302, 201, 202, 203 of the Pakistan Penal Code and section 15 of Arms Act.

FIR of case was registered in Shangla district on June 29

The complainant in the FIR was ASI Qaribullah, who stated that he received information from the petitioner, Aslam Khan, that his wife Salma committed suicide and her body was lying in his house.
He stated that pursuant to the information, he along with other police officials reached the spot and found the body lying in a pool of blood.
The body was sent for autopsy and the report provided that the deceased had not committed suicide as one of the bullets hit her left shoulder from behind, which was not possible in a suicide.
In the light of medical report and other information collected by the police, the petitioner was charged for the murder of his wife.
Police claimed that the motive of the murder was strained relations of the couple. They alleged that the petitioner was not of good character due to which he was often reprimanded by the deceased.
The petitioner’s counsel contended that his client was falsely implicated in the case and there was no eyewitness to the occurrence. 
He stated that the petitioner was present in the market at the time of occurrence when he received information about his wife committing suicide.
The bench observed that as per contents of the FIR, the petitioner claimed that his wife committed suicide but that claim was falsify by the medico-legal report.
The bench observed that the record revealed that in post events of the occurrence, the petitioner was not around anywhere including at the time of shifting of his inured wife to the hospital for treatment and then in receiving the body from the hospital or identifying the body before the doctor and also to attend her funeral ceremony.
It was added that such unnatural conduct on the part of petitioner in the case of unnatural death of the deceased made him disentitled for the grant of bail.
Earlier, bail petition of the petitioner was also turned down by an additional district and sessions judge in Shangla with the observation that a valuable human life was lost while the version presented by the petitioner shrouded in mystery, showing that he had somewhat link with the commission of the offence.

Kaghan bridge’s collapse suspends KP-GB traffic

Torrential rains also damaged houses in several localities. Suspension of power supply for several hours was also reported.
Meanwhile, a bridge on the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road was washed away by flash floods in Battal area of Kaghan valley on Tuesday evening.
The bridge’s collapse suspended traffic between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan stranding road users, including tourists, in large numbers.
Deputy commissioner Adnan Khan Bittani told reporters that the National Highway Authority had shifted machinery to the area to install a temporary bridge for traffic’s restoration.
He said the continuing rains had hampered rescue and rehabilitation activities but he hoped for the early resumption of those activities. He said the people stranded in the valley, especially tourists, would leave for their destinations soon.
While a portion of the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road was eroded by the downpour, heavy landslides blocked it at many points.
The road’s closure caused long queues of vehicles on its both sides to the misery of travellers, especially women and children.
“Besides blocking roads, landslides also diverted the course of the Kunhar River water. They also hit a pickup vehicle injuring its driver,” a witness said, adding that it could take days to clear the road of the mass of rock and earth, which came down the hills.
Kaghan Hoteliers Association president Saith Matiullah hoped for the early reopening of the road to traffic and said hotel owners and workers would treat stranded people as guests until the artery was blocked.
Kaghan Development Authority assistant director Asad Shahzad said machinery had been shifted to the rain-hit areas, while tourists and passengers had moved away from the MNJ Road on foot.

The residents of the remote Madan locality of Tirah told Dawn that more than 20 cows were killed by the disease in the valley as there was no treatment facility for the affected animals.
Zarin Khan, a resident of Maidan, said that the rapid spread of LSD terrified the locals as they lost their cows and a number of others were affected by the disease with no official assistance in sight.
He said that people were relying hugely on cattle for their daily requirements for dairy products.
Nauroz Khan, a local dispenser, told Dawn that most of the livestock owners arranged vaccines on their own as the lone veterinary dispensary in Karnakhel locality of Maidan was not yet to be made operational.
He said that the owners of affected animals were approaching private clinics for treatment where no medicines or vaccines were available, nor the local paramedics or dispensers had any knowledge about the treatment of LSD.
He said that the disease started affecting local livestock after the arrival of sacrificial animals from other parts of the province during Eidul Azha. “We brought the matter into the notice of local officials but no timely action was taken to save our domestic animals,” he lamented.
Reports about the sudden death of a number of cattle heads were also received from Sheen Pokh locality of Loe Shalman in Landi Kotal.
Malak Imroz and Gulab Khan, residents of the area, bordering Afghanistan, told Dawn that livestock was one of the major sources of livelihood for them and the sudden spread of LSD deprived them of their precious ‘assets’.
They said that the number of the domestic animals in Sheen Pokh was more than 2,000. They said they were at the risk of losing hundreds of their domestic animals if they were not provided with timely medical assistance. “We have already lost 119 cattle due to the deadly disease,” they added.
Aftab Khan, an official of livestock department, when contacted, said that several teams were constituted to vaccinate all the animals in Sheen Pokh locality.
He said that the newly constructed veterinary hospital in Sheen Pokh would be made operational in two weeks.
