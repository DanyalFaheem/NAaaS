• Developer citing financial crisis offers commercial area to authority
ISLAMABAD: The city managers have sought the opinion of the attorney general of Pakistan (AGP) on a proposal floated by owner of BNP Group’s multi-storey One Constitution Avenue project regarding the proposed new resettlement plan of outstanding payment owed by the developer to the Capital Development Authority (CDA).
In response to a proposal submitted by chief executive of the said project, Abdul Hafeez Sheikh, CDA’s Member Planning Naveed Ilahi, through a letter, sought guidance from the AGP.
The said project was de-sealed in January last year after the developer deposited Rs1.7 billion with the CDA on account of first installment of Rs17.5 billion, fixed by a three-member bench of the Supreme Court headed by then chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar in 2019.
However, now, sources said the developer, through a letter, told the CDA that due to current economic conditions “it has become impossible for us to complete the project and also make the annual installment of Rs2.9 billion”.
“Present value of the balance amount of Rs14.583 billion [which, according to him] comes to Rs9.46 billion discounted at 15.57pc,” the developer wrote.
The letter further stated: “BNP offers to transfer the commercial area valuing Rs9.46 billion in favour of CDA immediately ... CDA will become the exclusive owner of the said commercial property in lieu of the balance ‘discounted’ lease amount payable and will be at the liberty to use, rent or sell the commercial area.” 
The group also requested buyers of apartments to “voluntarily share some of the unreasonable burden imposed on us by Supreme Court” but none of them responded positively, the letter stated, adding regrettably, all this has compromised our ability to complete the project and make payments of lease installments.
After receiving the said letter, sources said that the member estate decided that CDA cannot entertain the proposal of the developer without getting input from the AGP. “I am directed to enclose a representation received from Chief Executive M/s BNP, Islamabad with regards to the settlement of pending litigations and balance amount owed by them to CDA as per the orders of Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan dated 09-1-2019. 
“It is submitted that the office of Attorney General representing the federal government before Apex Court and is now also representing the government in the pending review petitions filed by both M/s BNP and Authority [CDA] separately,” read the letter.
“Moreover, earlier a detailed inquiry was conducted by a committee constituted by the then prime minister on 16-11-2017 under the Attorney General of Pakistan in pursuance of the orders of the Honourable Islamabad High Court to address certain issues arising out of the litigation concerning the project,” it added. 
It is relevant to note here that the said project was sealed in 2016 by CDA and lease of the plot was also cancelled as the plot was meant for construction of a hotel but the developer had built and sold residential apartments instead.
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) upheld CDA’s decision but the Supreme Court restored the lease in 2019 and directed the BNP Group to pay CDA Rs17.5 billion in eight years.
According to the Supreme Court’s ruling, the developer is supposed to pay Rs17.5 billion in eight years in installments starting from January 2019. Both the developer and the CDA separately had filed review petitions in court against the said ruling, but decided to implement the SC judgment of 2019 in true letter and spirit till the outcome of the review petitions.
This project is said to be an elite project as buyers of the apartments in the said building include former prime minister Imran Khan, former chief justice of Pakistan Nasirul Mulk, former Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani, PML-N leader Khawaja Mohammad Asif, Federal Ombudsperson for the Protection of Women Against Sexual Harassment at the Workplace Kashmala Tariq.
According to the developer, two towers of the serviced apartments have been completed and work on construction of the shopping mall is near completion and construction of the hotel is yet to be carried out. The CDA had auctioned the plot to the said company in 2005 to build a luxury hotel.

4,"Why US envoys allowed to visit sensitive areas, questions Shireen Mazari",Says Washington conspired to remove well-performing PTI govt through local collaborators.,"ISLAMABAD: After criticising the visit of US Ambassador Donald Blome to Landikotal and Torkham border last week, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senior Vice President Dr Shireen Mazari on Tuesday said Mr Blome’s meeting with officials of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government and the chief minister was not a big deal.
However, she questioned under which contract US ambassadors visit sensitive areas while no Pakistani diplomat can go to any sensitive area in other countries.
The party, which criticised the meeting of US embassy officials with parliamentarians during its tenure, has been facing criticism over the contradiction in its stances towards the US.
Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, Dr Mazari alleged that the US had conspired to remove the well-performing PTI government through the local collaborators.

Says Washington conspired to remove well-performing PTI govt through local collaborators

She said the American ambassador was holding meetings with the provincial and federal governments. Under which agreement, he was allowed to visit the Pak-Afghan border, she asked.
Lashing out at the government for allegedly torturing party leader Shahbaz Gill, Dr Mazari demanded that sedition cases should also be filed against Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, Asif Ali Zardari, Ayaz Sadiq and Khawaja Asif as their statements were more alarming and dangerous.
She alleged that Shehbaz Gill’s body had signs of torture, claiming he was stripped naked and tortured.
She stated that if Mr Gill did anything unlawful, the law should take its course, but first he must be given a chance of fair trial to prove his innocence.
“If someone is accused of contravening law of the land or violating Constitution, he must be given a fair trial to defend himself so court can decide and give justice,” she added.
The PTI leader lamented that it was horrific to first abduct him, register an FIR and then tortured him. Shahbaz Gill’s body showed severe marks of torture, she added.
Talking about the prohibited funding case against the PTI, she said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the chief election commissioner (CEC) were working on a completely biased approach as the Supreme Court and the Islamabad High Court had clear directions to decide all the cases simultaneously.
Coming down hard on the government for increasing petrol prices, she said the government of “thieves” dropped another petrol bomb that would further augment the miseries of the inflation-ridden and pervert-stricken masses. She advised [PML-N leader] Maryam Nawaz to stop staging a drama on petrol prices.
PTI delegation meets Gill in jail
A seven-member parliamentary delegation of the PTI visited Adiala jail on Tuesday and met Dr Shahbaz Gill. They expressed serious concern over alleged police torture on him.
The delegation was led by Senator Dr Shehzad Wasim and comprised senators Saifullah Niazi, Shibli Faraz, Azam Swati, Abdul Qadir, Saifullah Abro and Sardar Gurdeep Singh. The lawmakers would brief the party leadership about the meeting.

System being created to keep complainants up-to-date

A detailed briefing was given on laws related to the harassment of women and the measures adopted. 
Ms Khan said anti-harassment laws had played an important role in providing a safe environment for women in offices, factories and other workplaces and now women were more confident and could perform their duties in a favourable environment.
Under the anti-harassment laws, a system is being devised to give continuous updates of the case to the complainant, under which the complainant will be informed about all stages of processing of the complaint.
She said the consultation process was ongoing at the divisional level to implement the laws in a more effective manner, adding that without a safe environment, society could not benefit from the potential of women and development and prosperity were not possible without the participation of women in the economic process and self-sufficiency.
UN Representative Tania Durrani said awareness of women’s rights and implementation of anti-harassment laws in Pakistan had improved significantly, in which the ombudsman and other government departments had played a significant role.
She said women in public and private departments had got a better environment than before, which was a result of joint efforts between the government and people. Officials of various departments spoke about their recommendations.

“There will be a one-window operation and people seeking to get their domiciles will get them on the same day on which they applied after submission of all the necessary documents,” said Assistant Commissioner Fazail Mudassir while briefing newsmen about the system in Hassanabdal on Tuesday.
He said that this was a step forward for the issuance of domiciles to the people of Hassanabdal tehsil in a hassle-free environment while all services and facilities will directly be monitored by Punjab Information Technology Board Lahore to ensure transparency.
He added that the one-window operation would spare precious time of applicants, mostly students.
Responding to a question, he said that the new system would make the process efficient and user-friendly, and would have zero chances of duplication or fake domicile issuance.
The verification, he said, would be done online as well. The domicile, he said, would be issued the same day when one would apply for it.
The best advantage of the computerised and automated system would be verification, record-keeping and a proper backup.
“There won’t be any duplication of domicile in future,” he added. He said the licences of two stamp vendors were cancelled after they were found guilty in an inquiry conducted by officials of the local administration and the revenue department of unnecessary delays in the issuance of e-stamp paper to the applicants for domiciles.

Mian Israr Ali, entomologist of the tehsil health department, told Dawn that two patients belonged to ward 8 of Wah Cantonment and one to rural union council.
The health official said that surveillance was underway to detect the existence of dengue larvae. Besides, strict action has also been taken against violators of dengue SOPs.
According to District Coordinator Epidemics Prevention and Control (DCEPC) Dr Sajjad Mehmood, so far this year two patients were reported from Taxila Cantonment, three from Wah while one from Taxila rural.

Responding to a question, he said during the indoor anti-dengue surveillance, larvae was found in 294 houses in Taxila Cantonment, 74 in Taxila city while 64 in Taxila rural.
Sources said that a number of suspected patients mostly from Lalazar, Gulshan Colony, Shadman Town of Wah and various localities of Taxila Cantonment have been admitted in various private hospitals of Taxila and Wah.
The health department is responsible for spray in six union councils in rural areas, while TMA is responsible for four union councils in urban centers. 
Despite the growing threat of the dengue spread in the area, both departments have failed to carry out spray on time as such practice carried out only on papers as no physical activity was carried out in the Taxila and Wah.

Police officers told Dawn that both the FIRs were registered at the Industrial Area Police Station. The FIR (10012) over the robbery was registered at 5:05am and the time of the occurrence mentioned in it was 4am. The other FIR (1013) over the encounter was registered at 7:15am and the shoot-out time mention in it was 5:15am, they added.
There were two robbers mentioned in the FIR registered over the robbery. However, the FIR registered over the encounter said the police tried to intercepted three suspects and one of them was killed and another injured from the firing of of their accomplice. The FIR said the robbery incident had taken place two kilometres from the police station at southwest side while the police and suspects also came face to face two km away from the police station at the eastern side.
Normally, robbers flee from the spot after committing a crime to avoid their arrest, the officers said. They said according to the robbery FIR, the culprits looted Rs1,767,000 and three mobile phones from three persons but roamed in the area for an hour till they were spotted and intercepted.
The police claim that they got information about the robbery at 4:20am is also quite strange as the robbers looted three mobile phones at around 4am. It is hard to find a calling device to inform police after one is deprived of his phone, the officers added.
The police on Tuesday claimed that a patrolling team spotted two persons on a motorcycle in I-8 acting suspiciously. When they saw the police chasing them, the suspects opened fire on the police who retaliated and during the cross-firing one of the suspects was killed and the other injured.
The police claim was however changed in the FIR registered over the incident which stated that the police had set up a picket on information of the robbery when three persons riding a motorcycle appeared there. But they left the motorcycle there and escaped on foot and were cashed by the police. The police overpowered one of them after which the other fired at the police.
“A suspect fired at the police to get his accomplice freed during which his two accomplices sustained bullet injuries fired by him,” the FIR said, adding later he escaped from the spot.
When the in-charge of the Police Public Relations Branch DIG Awais Ahmed was contacted, he refused to comment.
However, a PRO said he had the same version as mentioned in the FIRs.

12,Experts call for enforcing environment impact assessment to reduce disaster risk,Say urban systems need to be strengthened to withstand challenges...,"ISLAMABAD: Speakers at a webinar on Tuesday pointed out that disaster risk reduction should go hand in hand with urban expansion with rigorous implementation of environment impact assessment and proper land-use policies and plans.
The webinar on ‘Urban resilient infrastructure in Pakistan’was organised by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).
Aisha Khan, Executive Director for Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change, urged the need for strengthening urban systems to withstand challenges of mounting energy demands, land-use changes, loss of green spaces to urban expansion and development, pressure on road network, pollution, solid waste management and wastewater management etc.
She said energy efficient constructions, sensitising the public on responsible consumption of energy and other resources, were critical to prevent climate change from further exaggerating. She said groundwater abstractions were adding pressure and after years of deliberation no groundwater regulatory framework or water tariff regime had been accomplished.

Say urban systems need to be strengthened to withstand challenges

Ms Khan said that the system of surface water drainage and mass transit must be enhanced to meet the urban expansion rate, adding rainwater catchment remained a neglected aspect of urban planning.
As a transit city to tourist areas in Pakistan, the pressure on the health infrastructure in Islamabad has increased manifold and no capacity enhancement has been planned or executed. She said Islamabad as the capital and planned city should have been developed as a model solarised city.
Mubushar Hussain, Manager Disaster Risk Reduction, National Disaster Risk Management Fund, said that NDRMF was working on disaster resilience and disaster risk management throughout Pakistan by issuing call for proposals, funding and executing disaster resilience projects in collaboration with public and private sector.
The organisation is also worked on building risk management capacity at the community level for quick response to natural disasters keeping in view the recurrent and intense nature of such events.
He explained that NDRMF was funding early warning systems, heath systems post-Covid-19 and nature-based solutions for ecosystem restoration and climate adaptation. It is also developing a mechanism for risk transfer through disaster risk insurance based on a holistic funding model.
He explained the funding model aims for market based, sustainable products and data to reduce fiscal burden on government. Currently, in urban areas unplanned expansion and encroachment has significantly impacted surface drainage system. NDRMF is providing financing to the most vulnerable cities to develop these systems.
He called for research and development, technology-based solutions and re-evaluation of master plans every three years for climate smart resilient infrastructure.
Nabeel Siddiqui, CEO Modulus Tech, said climate smart housing was affordable, resource efficient, low carbon footprint and adhered to the SDGs agenda. He said while the previous government presented policy plans for affordable housing for low-income groups, it did not address the issue of energy consumption and subsequent emissions. He pointed out that 40 per cent of emissions from housing was generated due to energy consumption.
He stressed the need on a holistic approach to develop ideal net zero self-sustaining communities rather than implementing individual SDGs in isolated efforts.
Dr Hina Aslam, Research Fellow SDPI, said there was no more time for climate change mitigation rather adaptation and action must be focused proactively. She appreciated the initiative of mandatory implementation of urban plan for developing resilient infrastructure, land-use plan and robust environmental impact assessment.
She said unplanned and unchecked expansion and encroachment of urban sprawls engulfing agricultural lands was increasing pressure on resources and undermining resilience to climate change and climate induced disasters.

15,Pakistan ranked 92nd out of 116 countries on Global Hunger Index: report,"Data reveals alarming rise in number of hungry, poor people.","ISLAMABAD: While the world is off-track in the fight against hunger and moving further away from the binding goal of ending hunger by 2030, the 2021 Global Hunger Index (GHI) showed that over the years, Pakistan has shown improvement as the country was ranked 92nd out of 116.
GHI is a peer-reviewed report published by the Concern Worldwide of Ireland and Welthungerhilfe (WHH) every year since 2007 to track hunger across the globe.
An event, to launch the chapter regarding Pakistan, was organised at a local hotel on Tuesday and attended by the nutrition section of the Scaling up Nutrition (SUN) Secretariat in the planning ministry.
The sources of data to compile the report every year essentially include the Demographic and Health Surveys of Pakistan (DHSP) and nutrition-related surveys in the country, carried out by or led by the government.

Data reveals alarming rise in number of hungry, poor people

It is worth mentioning that developed countries are not included in the survey so the report is based on the situation of developing and under-developed countries. This year, data of only 116 countries was available. As per the report, the country considered to have a reduced ratio of hunger is close to zero and ones close to 100 are considered to have a higher hunger ratio.
This year, Pakistan with a score of 24.7 is ranked 92 out of 116 countries with sufficient data available. India has been ranked at 101 but other countries of the region showed better ranking as compared to Pakistan. Sri Lanka was ranked 65th whereas Nepal and Bangladesh were ranked 76th.
Data from the latest United Nations report is alarming as the number of hungry and poor people has been rising again for several years. In the world today, some 811 million people suffer from hunger and 41 million live on the brink of famine whereas 47 countries will not even reach low hunger levels by 2030; as many as 28 of these countries are in Africa.
The chapter regarding Pakistan shows that the situation regarding hunger was improving since 2000 as the ratio was 36.7 in year 2000, at 33.1 in year 2006, at 32.1 in year 2012 and in year 2021, the points further dropped to 24.7.
During the event, Aisha Jamshed, country director of Welthungerhilfe, welcomed guests and informed them about the objective of the GHI as well as Welthungerhilfe’s work of assisting food insecure communities and build resilience in cooperation with the civil society, government and private sector.
Food and Nutrition Security Advisor Omer Bangash, principal scientific officer from Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Dr Omer Tarar, chief of nutrition at the Ministry of Planning Dr Nazeer Ahmed, country director of the World Food Programme Chris Kaye and others spoke to participants.
