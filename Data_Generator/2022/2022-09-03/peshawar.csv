The assistance will benefit tens of thousands of flood affected people in coming days, according to a statement issued here on Friday. The items included 133,244 blankets, 80,000 mosquito nets, 35,347 jerrycans, 23,898 kitchen sets, plastic tarpaulins, buckets, solar lamps, and others.
UNHCR head of sub-office in Peshawar Gayrat Ahmadshoev and PDMA director- general Sharif Hussain signed a memorandum for the handover of relief goods for immediate distribution to disaster survivors.
The PDMA DG welcomed the UNHCR contribution and said the UN agency’s support was timely and important and would greatly help the efforts of the authorities to assist the people of the province in the current crisis.
The UNHCR’s representative said his organisation was committed to supporting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and its people for flood relief and rehabilitation.
“Our teams have been out to visit flood-affected communities and provide our emergency support adding to the ongoing effort of Pakistani authorities. We are working closely with the PDMA and will do everything we can at this time to help and stand by the people of the province,” he said.

4,Mining activity depleting Khanpur Dam’s storage capacity,"Waste material continues to accumulate in the reservoir; lease owners claim their units causing no harm to dam, environment","HARIPUR: The administration of Khanpur Dam has said that mining and stone crushing activities upstream of the reservoir are posing serious threat to the dam’s storage capacity as the crushing plant owners are dumping the waste material in the catchment area illegally.
Through a letter, it has asked the mine and minerals department to cancel the mining lease for the purpose of safety of the dam.
However, the lease owners, on the other hand, claimed that they had fulfilled the preconditions of making their project environment-friendly. They said that they were taking all necessary measures including construction of a check dam, retention wall and massive plantation for the purpose.
The letter was sent to director of the department from the office of executive engineer of the dam and was endorsed by the office of project director of Khanpur Dam at Tarbela head office on August 10, 2022.

Waste material continues to accumulate in the reservoir; lease owners claim their units causing no harm to dam, environment

Referring to an onsite visit to the area, the dam authorities said that 12 crushers were conducting mining activities in the hills of village Choi in Khanpur.
The plant owners, according to the letter, are dumping the raw material after crushing in the floodplain area of Nilan Kas, which is a major source of water to Khanpur reservoir. “These continuous crushing pose a serious threat to Khanpur reservoir’s water storage capacity,” it said.
The letter said that the piled up raw material narrowed the riverbed of Nilan Kas besides carrying a big quantity of material to the reservoir during the rainfall. It advised the mines department to cancel all the mining leases and stop crushing activity upstream the reservoir and ask the owners to clear the riverbed for avoiding further depletion of storage capacity as the dam was one of the major sources of municipal water supply to Rawalpindi and Islamabad besides irrigating a vast tract of agricultural land in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
“If the raw material continues to accumulate in the reservoir unchecked, it is feared that the dam administration would have to raise the existing dead level of the reservoir for the sake of protection of its canals,” said 
The chief engineer Tarbela, who is also project director of Khanpur Dam by virtue of his post, Toresh Kumar, when contacted, said that the dam administration had written many times to the mine and minerals department and local administration about the risks of depleting storage capacity of reservoir.
However, he said that no action was taken in that regard so far. “The department has even not bothered to respond to the letters,” he said. He said that there was no immediate need to raise the dead level of the dam as the maximum flow of rain-fed Khanpur reservoir was 4,000 to 6,000 cusecs.
Mr Kumar said that officials of Environment Protection Agency would visit the dam on Sept 8 to inspect it and discuss future line of action.
“I will conduct a fresh study this year as both the crushing activity and heavy rains have necessitated the on ground situation of the storage,” said Sohail Ahmed, the executive engineer of Khanpur Dam. He also confirmed the risks that the dam was exposed to due to inflowing sand and silt
However, Omar Farooq, the spokesperson for one of the lease owners, rejected that the mining and crushing activities were posing any risk to the reservoir. 
He said that Environmental Protection Agency, archaeology department, mines and minerals department and industries department issued NOC to the 33-year lease owners after scrutinising that the project was not going to harm the reservoir or the environment.

Sultan Rome of Barkana area told reporters that the recent flash floods had caused a large-scale damage to agricultural lands and crops.
He said the irrigation channels constructed by farmers and landowners by themselves were also damaged.
The grower warned if the government didn’t allocate funds to rehabilitate agricultural lands, construct flood embankments next to their riverside agricultural lands and repair irrigation channels, no crops would be grown in the district.
Adnan Rafi, a farmer in Bisham, said agricultural lands were protected by embankments but the recent flash floods destroyed them ruining standing crops.
“Our lands will be flooded if water outflow from the Khan Khwar River increases. The government should ensure the construction of riverside flood embankments with the help of quality material to protect our lands,” he said.
Ali Bhash Khan, a grower and village nazim from Basi area of Alpuri, said the downpour-induced flooding had destroyed agricultural lands and standing crops in the region but the government had yet to announce funds for their rehabilitation.
He said both federal and provincial governments should allocate funds for calamity-hit growers, write off their loans and announce new ones for them to grow crops.
The grower complained that the irrigation department had no office in Shangla, so the residents had to go to Swat for the resolution of grievances.
He said floodwaters damaged most irrigation channels.

A bench consisting of Justice Roohul Amin Khan and Justice Shahid Khan issued the stay order against the FPA in electricity bills of the local residents on the petition of the Frontier Printers and Publishers Association and issued notices to the respondents, including Pesco chief executive, chairmen of Wapda and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, federal energy secretary, for response on the next hearing.
It observed that the points raised by the petitioner needed consideration.
It decided to grant interim relief to the petitioner declaring that the collection, imposition and charging of FPA has been suspended to the extent of power consumers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Asks govt, Pesco, regulator for reply to petition against FPA imposition

Lawyers Shahid Qayyum Khattak and Saeed Roman appeared for the petitioner, whereas Nazish Muzaffar represented Pesco along with chief law officer Irfan Riayat and law officer Mohammad Taufeeq.
The petitioner’s counsel contended that the charging of FPA from the petitioner and other consumers in this province was illegal and without lawful authority.
They contended that the power so consumed by the consumers of KP was of hydroelectric generation and in this regard the province was self- sufficient, whereas, the surplus power was shared with other provinces.
They argued that collection of FPA was subject to the generation of power through sources other than hydel.
They contended that the imposition of FPA on consumers of this province was liable to be declared as null and void.
They requested the court to restrain the respondents from claiming and recovering the FPA from consumers here in future.
They further requested the court to direct the respondents to return the already imposed/ levied and collected amount on account of FPA from the petitioner and other consumers of the province, from whom these were unlawfully recovered.
The lawyers said that most members of the association did business in small shops and it had been badly hit by the escalating inflation rate.
They said that the respondents had sent huge amount in monthly electricity bills of Aug on account of FPA for June, which was beyond the paying capacity of the members of the petitioner association as well other consumers.
The counsel contended that the whole businesses of the association members would stop due to imposition of the said FPA in electricity bills.
They argued that this province was blessed with immense hydroelectric potential and the hydroelectric generation of this province was 58 per cent of the total hydroelectric generation.
The lawyers said that it won’t be wrong to say that the production of this province was almost double that what it actually consumed.
They contended that charging the consumers of this province on the pattern of the consumers of other Discos (distribution companies) violated Article 4 of the Constitution as the electricity produced in the province was from hydel sources.
The counsel said that the rate of electricity generated from hydel was hardly Rs1.03 per kWh, while after mixing the same with the electricity produced through other sources, the rate went very high.
