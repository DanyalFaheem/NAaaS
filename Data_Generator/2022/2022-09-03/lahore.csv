0,Three kidnapped amid police operation,Protesters block Guddu-Kashmor road against the incident,"RAHIM YAR KHAN: Despite an ongoing police operation in the area, dacoits kidnapped three men from Chowk Mahi near Murid Shakh on Friday. 
According to police, three men -- Ghulam Mustafa Mirani, Bakht Ali Mirani and Ali Nawaz Malik -- were going on Guddu Road when some dacoits kidnapped them.  
Later, in a video uploaded on social media dacoits carrying latest weapons said in Sindhi language that police had picked up their three men and two women from a private hospital at Sadiqabad on Thursday.

Reacting to the kidnapping, scores of people belonging to Mirani and Malik clans blocked Guddu-Kashmor road, near Daowala police checkpoint demanding recovery of the men. They alleged that Kot Sabzal SHO was incompetent and failed to maintain law and order in the area.  
The kidnapping took place at a time when RYK police, with the coordination of Rajanpur and Ghotki police, were carrying out an intelligence-based operation led by District Police Officer (DPO) Akhtar Farooq near Chowk Mahi for the last few days.
Kidnapping of three men despite the presence of police in the area raised many questions about the law and order situation there.
In the video, the kidnapped persons were seen requesting the dacoits for their immediate release.
In a press release, police spokesperson Saif Ali Wains said the operation against dacoits in Kacha area and Sadiqabad circle was going on. He claimed that dacoits had shared the video to pressurise the police to halt the operation. On the instructions of the DPO a police team had been constituted to analyse the video, he said, adding that all resources would be used to nab the dacoits.

The virtual museum is a digital platform for artists, academics and creative practitioners to reexamine shared cultural language and artistic legacy. The project is a part of the British Council’s Pakistan-UK Season: New Perspectives programme to mark the 75th anniversary of Pakistan. 
Speaking on the occasion, LBF Executive Director Qudsia Rahim said the NCA, where the virtual museum exhibition was held, was an important space for her.  
“It’s the same place where I used to work,” she said, adding that the exhibition was a combined effort of the artists and curators. She said the LBF was striving hard to create a nationwide alliance of artists to help out the flood-affected people. She thanked NCA Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Murtaza Jafri for providing the space to the foundation to hold the exhibition. 
“The virtual museum is a unique form of archiving, knowledge making and exhibition discourse in response to the global socio-cultural changes in museum practice and public perception. Curated by collaboration of leading local artists and academics, and not with a Western lens, it represents our shared history and heritage, and hopes to build upon the research as presented by local practitioners. With the current climate crisis in the country, it is now more crucial than ever to come together, collaborate and help each other,” Ms Rahim said. 
Mr Jafri shared with the audience that the NCA would build 100 houses for the flood-affected people and send 1,000 tents for them. 
Kate Joyce, business director cultural engagement, South Asia, British Council, said, “The virtual museum is an innovative way to use art and heritage in community building in an inclusive and impactful way. This formed part of our programme of activity for Pakistan/UK: New Perspectives programme. I look forward to many young artists and curators contributing to this space as we go and meaningfully sharing ideas that pave the way for an inclusive and sustainable future.” 
Additional Secretary Culture Farhat Jabeen also spoke. 
The project plans to develop and sell Art/NFTs as part of the LBF virtual museum for flood relief. Many people, including - Farida Batool, Salima Hashmi, Imran Qureshi, Masooma Syed and Sarmad Khoosat, involved with the virtual museum have already committed to donate to the cause.

It was a meditation on the feminist activism in Pakistan over the course of 75 years. 
Taos Chaman by Masooma was an artistic rendering of locations in ordinary cities, towns, villages and small communities in South Asia, by artists who have lived there. It explored the plurality of South Asian culture through the stories of migrants, marginalised individuals and communities. 
Manduva: Exploring What We Won’t Like to Call ‘Lollywood’ curated by Sarmad Khoosat investigated the evolution of Pakistani cinema, its stories and relationship with the sociopolitical landscape of the country.

2,Tarar gets pre-arrest bail in PA violence case,LAHORE: A sessions court on Friday granted interim pre-arrest bail to prime minister’s special assistant Attaullah...,"LAHORE: A sessions court on Friday granted interim pre-arrest bail to prime minister’s special assistant Attaullah Tarar in a case relating to violence in the Punjab Assembly on the day of election of chief minister on April 16.  
Tarar appeared before the court along with his counsel and sought the bail. The court allowed the bail till Sept 14 subject to furnishing of surety bonds and also directed the petitioner to join the police investigation.  
Speaking to the media persons outside court, Tarar lashed out at Chief Minister Parvez Elahi and his son Moonis Elahi for holding political rallies during the testing times of massive flooding in the province. He said the government should shun political rallies and reach out to the affectees of the floods.  
Answering a query about rising prices of petrol, Tarar said finance minister Miftah Ismail was doing a good job and the government would soon give relief to the masses. He said former chief minister Hamza Shehbaz had returned to the country and the party would boost its political activities.  
About the case against him, Tarar said he was not even present in the house but police at the behest of the government implicated him in the case.  
Initially, the Qilla Gujjar Singh police had registered a case against the MPAs of PTI and PML-Q and staff of the assembly on charges of resorting to violence during the election of the chief minister, wherein Hamza Shehbaz emerged victorious against Parvez Elahi. The MPAs of the coalition government were also charged for manhandling then deputy speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari.  
Several MPAs of the PTI and PML-Q besides staff of the assembly, including then secretary Muhammad Khan Bhatti, had secured pre-arrest bail from the court in the case.  
After the victory of Mr Elahi in a run-off election for the chief minister, police changed direction of investigation towards the MPAs of PML-N and started summoning them. Police also got warrants from a judicial magistrate concerned for the arrest of MPAs including Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, Attaullah Tarar, Sardar Awais Leghari, Saiful Malook Khokhar, Pir Khizar Hayat Khagga and Raja Sagheer Ahmad.

3,HRCP seeks national action plan for relief operation,Says role of local govts vital,"LAHORE: Amid political, economic and climate crises enveloping Pakistan, a public meeting held by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has put forward civil society’s concerns and a draft charter of demands.
An immediate concern is the devastation caused by the ongoing floods that are a result not only of the climate crisis but also of the state’s failure to carry out sustainable, pro-poor, pro-people development. Additionally, constant political confrontation continues to undermine democratic values at the expense of ordinary citizens’ needs, while decades of elite capture, hyper-securitisation and short-sighted economic planning have pushed daily-wage and fixed-income workers to the brink of survival, observes the meeting.
Civil society demands that a national action plan be conceived and implemented jointly by the federal and provincial governments to rescue and provide relief to all those affected by the floods as well as to rehabilitate their lives and livelihood, it says. The role of local governments is the key in this regard: they must be strengthened and given the technical and financial resources and autonomy needed to carry out relief work, climate change-resilient reconstruction and disaster preparedness. At the same time, the state must revise its policies towards civil society: the ousting of international NGOs has only worsened the current crisis.
Pakistan’s climate crisis is also political. Civil society demands that the state give all provinces a fair hearing and address the legitimate grievances of all ethnicities—in particular in Balochistan, Sindh, former FATA and the Seraiki wasaib—if it expects to put forward a united front to counter the climate emergency.

Says role of local govts vital  

It is equally critical that women be represented equally across all institutional and government tiers. Once national elections take place, they must be held in a free and fair manner that ensures a representative government with the political will to protect the interests of the working classes and marginalised groups.
Speaking at the meeting, senior journalist Imtiaz Alam said that civil society must develop a charter of demands encompassing the protection of all fundamental rights.
Human rights defender Tanveer Jehan said that disaster preparedness strategies should include mobile medical units and systems to trace families that had been divided by disasters.
Political economist Dr Fahd Ali said that the IMF deal should be renegotiated because Pakistan now needed fiscal space to carry out rehabilitation and reconstruction. 
He said the defence expenditure should be openly debated.HRCP chairperson Hina Jilani said it was critical for civil society to work in unison against a growing political narrative that did not believe in rule-based order and that valued demagoguery and populism.

In a tweet on Friday he says, “We are confronting a gang of cowards, conspirators and swindlers having an indecent mentality. This gang vomits out its mental depravity and indulges in conspiracies against the institutions throughout the days.”
In a reference to Shehbaz Sharif government, he says the “cruel”, “incompetent” and “thief” ruler is holding the reins of power and causing grave difficulties for the nation every now and then.  
Cheema says that by shedding “crocodile tears” Shehbaz is not deceiving the people, rather himself. The team of Shehbaz Sharif can do acting for photo shoots, but proved to be highly incompetent and inefficient in running the country, he adds.
“The Shehbaz-Zardari gang hatched a conspiracy and got themselves imposed on Pakistan, which was treading on the path of progress. Now they are unable to run this country and busy hatching conspiracies and trying to become political martyrs. The nation is standing with Imran Khan and he will win the next elections with a two-thirds majority.”
