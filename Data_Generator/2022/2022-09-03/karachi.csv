0,Computer lab built 15 years ago in KU collapses,"“Twenty-five computers, the entire furniture in the lab and two air conditioners have been completely destroyed,” said Dr Farhat Hussain.","KARACHI: The roof of a computer lab situated in the arts faculty of Karachi University collapsed on Friday afternoon damaging valuable items inside. However, no casualty was reported.
Officials said that the lab of the Library and Information Science Department, located on the first floor of the arts faculty, was not being used for over three years.
“Twenty-five computers, the entire furniture in the lab and two air conditioners have been completely destroyed,” said Dr Farhat Hussain, in charge of the library and information science department.
He rejected reports about a student getting injured in the incident.
“I was at the site from 12 noon when this incident occurred till 5pm. None of the walls fell, though lab’s roof caved in,” he explained.
He added that the lab had been closed down three to four years back when the university ended a programme concerning computers.
Weak structures
Sources said several classrooms, labs and buildings on the KU campus were in shambles and the lab in question wasn’t an old one.
“The lab was built in 2007. It collapsed because it wasn’t an RCC (concrete reinforced cement) construction. The university’s engineering department has carried out the assessment of the fallen structure and will submit its report to the vice chancellor on Monday,” a senior university official told Dawn.
There were several such structures on the KU campus, he added.
The sources said while it’s the first case of collapse of an entire structure on the campus, incidents of falling plaster and leaking ceilings were common in many departments.
“Fortunately, the lab wasn’t being used for more than a year but anything could have happened,” Dr Ghufran Alam of the Karachi University Teachers’ Society said, while sharing teachers’ concern over the incident.
Last year, he recalled, a small portion of the ceiling fell in the biochemistry department.
“In that case, too, there was no injury. Perhaps, the university administration is waiting for a tragedy,” he regretted.
On behalf of Kuts, he demanded that the university administration immediately carry out a detailed professional evaluation of all buildings and classrooms on the campus as lives of thousands of students, teachers and non-teaching staff were at risk.
“Infrastructure of several departments is in shambles, including that of petroleum technology department, mathematics department and physiology department. The university administration must understand that carrying out repairs is not enough and there is an urgent need for a professional assessment of the infrastructure,” Dr Alam said.
No KU official was available for comments.

1,Man having ice cream with family shot dead as robbers go on looting spree in Karachi,"Muggers kill teenager, hurt three citizens over resistance in city.","KARACHI: In what appears to be a renewed wave of street crimes in the metropolis, armed muggers shot dead a human resource manager in front of his family and a teenager when they put up resistance to their robbery bids in different parts of the city on Friday. 
Also on Friday, three more people were shot at and wounded by armed robbers over resistance in the city. 
Gulistan-i-Jauhar SHO Pervez Bhutto said Zeeshan Afzal, 41, did some shopping from the Bin Hashim superstore near Munawar Chowrangi and drove to the Baloch Ice Cream shop with his wife and two children late on Thursday night. 
The family was having ice cream when two armed robbers riding a motorbike pulled up there. One of them showed Afzal his pistol upon which he tried to grab his hand to tackle the armed robber. However the robber opened fire on him and escaped along with his accomplice from the busy area famous for restaurants and eateries on Prof Ghafoor Ahmed Road.

Muggers kill teenager, hurt three citizens over resistance in city

Afzal suffered a critical bullet wound in the head and was taken to the nearby Darul Sehat Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival. 
The SHO said the victim had lived in the United Kingdom and presently he was the human resources manager at The Kidney Centre. 
The incident angered area residents, who staged a protest on the main road, causing a massive traffic jam on nearby roads.
Residents of Gulistan-i-Jauhar also took out a rally at Jauhar Chowrangi against the killing. 
The protesters said local residents experienced a sudden rise in robbery incidents lately. They complained that police reached the crime scene very late. 
However, SHO Bhutto said he along with other police officers was busy in security duties for a religious gathering held near the mausoleum of the Quaid-i-Azam on Thursday night. He said the police rushed to the spot after receiving information while Madadgar-15 police had already reached there. 
In the second incident, a 17-year-old boy was shot dead by armed robbers when he put up resistance in Korangi Industrial Area (KIA) late on Thursday night, police said on Friday.
Area SHO Pir Shabbir Haider said that Talha Aslam was standing outside his home in KDA Allahwala Town, where the K-Electric was carrying out loadshedding as per daily routine. 
Two armed motorcyclists approached him and tried to snatch his cell phone. The teenager put up resistance, upon which the robbers opened fire on him and fled along with the snatched cell phone. 
The young boy suffered critical bullet wounds in the chest and was taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival. 
Three citizens wounded by robbers 
Meanwhile, three people were shot at and wounded by armed robbers over resistance in separate incidents in Orangi Town on Friday evening, police and rescue services officials said. 
Two men, identified as Abdul Haseeb, 20, and Malak Zafar, 40, were shot at and critically wounded when they resisted a robbery bid in Baloch Goth. 
In another incident in Raees Amrohi Colony in Sector-11 ½ in Orangi Town, 20-year-old Rizwan was shot at and wounded over resistance to a robbery bid. 
All the wounded were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. 
Meanwhile, two suspected robbers Kashif, 28, and Abrar, 30, were shot and wounded in an encounter with police on Sharea Faisal near Chota Gate. They were taken into custody and moved to a hospital for treatment.

2,Notices issued on plea against citywide water shortages,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday issued notices to the provincial authorities, the Karachi Water and Sewerage...","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday issued notices to the provincial authorities, the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board, K-Electric and others on a petition filed against acute water shortages in the metropolis.  
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi also put the advocate general of Sindh on notice and directed the official respondents to file their replies/para-wise comments till the next date of hearing.  
A regular litigant approached the SHC stating that Karachi, which was already faced with acute water scarcity, was now witnessing a crisis after the 72-inch diameter pipelines of KWSB had burst at the Dhabeji pumping station last week.  
Citing the chief secretary, secretary of energy department, chairman & managing director of KWSB and KE as respondents, the petitioner argued that pipelines had burst due to sudden breakdown of power supply to the pumping station.  
He contended that the city was facing a shortfall of 125 million gallons daily (MGD) that caused a water crisis in the city and making lives of citizens miserable.  
He submitted that the KE had plunged the city into darkness and there was nobody to hold it accountable.
He said as to why the KE had suddenly shut the supply to pumping station despite an agreement between KE and the Sindh government and its institutions regarding payment of bills.  
However, the petitioner submitted that even if there was any issue of non-payment between the KE and the KWSB, the same must not be used as a pretext for depriving citizens of water and asked the court to take action against them.

4,Killing of PPP man in ‘police encounter’ sparks controversy,Waqar Mehdi says slain man was local leader; police identify him as drug peddler...,"KARACHI: A local leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was shot dead in an alleged encounter in the Pirabad area early on Friday morning.
The PPP, however, said that Nadir Magsi, 45, was killed in a ‘fake’ encounter and demanded an impartial probe. 
The killing sparked protest by area residents, who took to the streets and blocked main road for vehicular traffic.
In a late night development, the police suspended the area SHO and formed two probe bodies.
Pirabad SHO Anzar Alam said that police on Thursday night had launched an operation against alleged drug dealers in ‘Magsi Mohalla’ of Qasba Colony.

Waqar Mehdi says slain man was local leader; police identify him as drug peddler

He said that upon seeing the police suspect Nadir Magsi tried to run away, but police chased him and he was killed in an ensuing ‘encounter’ near Paracha graveyard. 
The police claimed to have recovered one TT pistol from him. The body was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for a post-mortem examination.
The SHO said Magsi had been booked in four FIRs lodged at the Pirabad police station and was declared an absconder by courts.
He said Magsi’s brother, Manzoor, and cousin Badshah “are also known drug dealers” in the area.
PPP denies police’s claim
However, PPP-Sindh general secretary Waqar Mehdi said Magsi was the area general secretary of the party. 
Quoting his family members, the senior PPP leader claimed that the police had detained him from his house at around 3-4am and killed him in a ‘fake’ encounter.
He said that even if there were criminal cases against him, the illegal killing of their party’s local leader in the ‘fake’ encounter could not be justified.
DIG-West Nasir Aftab told Dawn that two inquiry teams had been formed on the demand of the deceased’s heirs to probe the encounter as well as to conduct investigations into the entire case.
He said the Pirabad SHO was also suspended so that he could not influence the inquiry.
He said the operation was launched in Kati Pahari and Magsi Mohalla, which were particularly notorious for drugs like ‘ice’, crystal and other synthetic drugs.

5,"People who survive floods may die of starvation, says Faisal Edhi",Charity head says 90pc of flood-hit persons still await assistance; govt urged to immediately lift ban on INGOs.,"KARACHI: Highlighting the relief efforts made for those who have suffered at the hands of floods triggered by monsoon rains, members of welfare organisations, social workers and individuals involved in humanitarian work in the affected areas painted a bleak picture of the situation on Friday evening.
Speaking at a press conference at the Karachi Press Club, Faisal Edhi of the Edhi Foundation said no province of Pakistan has been spared by the floods. The situation is extremely poor and it’s going to worsen. People’s participation, compared to the 2010 floods or when the 2005 earthquake hit the northern areas, in relief work isn’t sufficient, he said. 
This is the reason that the speakers at the event, which was moderated by Zehra Khan, decided to appeal all organisations, including those who work under the UN, USAID, etc, to extend help.
Mr Edhi warned that if in this critical time those organisations leave us on our own, it will have global consequences. 

Charity head says 90pc of flood-hit persons still await assistance; govt urged to immediately lift ban on INGOs

He said: “I fear that international migration from Pakistan will begin, the way it happened after the Syrian war. Three to four crore [30 to 40 million] people have been affected by monsoon rains and hundreds of thousands of houses have been destroyed.
“I was there for nine days, and despite a great deal of effort made by Edhi Foundation, the government and NGOs, we could only reach 10 per cent people, 90pc of them still await assistance. There are people who say that they don’t want to come to the streets with their children and only ask for food. Water has entered their houses,” he said.
He continued: “I have had a chat with my son who is at Khairpur Nathan Shah and wants to go to Meher where many are stranded. They are at a distance of 25 kilometres but we will have to move around 300kms to reach them because of the four- to five-foot stagnant water. 
“Edibles are not available. Crops — rice, sugar, wheat and cotton — have been destroyed. Nothing is available to eat in Sindh and southern Punjab. The army is playing a great role in relief work. The government is also doing its bit. I’m happy that the government has distributed Rs25,000 among the affectees. But we would request them to speed up the process and the amount be raised. 
“We would also like to request the government to immediately lift the ban on international NGOs for one year and allow them to work because in 2010 and 2005 international NGOs played an important part in relief and rehabilitation work,” said Mr Edhi.       
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Junior said he’d like to keep working with Edhi Foundation. His father, late Murtaza Bhutto, had also worked with them.
Call to allow imports from India
Economist Dr Kaiser Bengali said two floods have affected the area: first it came in the shape of rains, and then rainwater from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab has come to Sindh through rivers. The destruction of crops has two negative impacts. One, the farmers’ source of earning has finished. Two, if there’s no foodstuff in the market, then the customers won’t get any, and even if it’s available, it will be at high prices.
“The need of the hour is to import. We should import for one year — rice, sugar, onions, lentils, cotton. One part of the aid that the government is getting should be kept for these imports. There is a need to import from India because the advantage of importing from India is less transportation cost. People who will not die from the floods might die from starvation. And the spread of diseases once the water subsides will also be a huge problem,” said Dr Bengali.
At this point, Mr Edhi interjected saying there are reports of deaths of children and the elderly from every district.
Retired Justice Rasheed A Razvi said the government doesn’t have volunteers to work with. The medium of international NGOs has not been allowed to function. The Charities Act 2019 was passed in quick time in the Sindh Assembly, imposing a ban on the working of NGOs. This is the time for the government to lift the ban on dedicated NGOs.
Karamat Ali of the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education & Research suggested that 10pc of the GDP should be directed toward relief work.
Nasir Mansoor of the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF) said the NDMA should be made pro-people.
Dr Mirza Ali Azhar of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) said the outbreak of diseases has already begun. There have been massive casualties which are not being reported. He also demanded that the process of receiving aid should be made transparent.
During the question-answer session, Mr Edhi said the government should curtail its expenditures. “There are certain organisations which are not treating the minorities well. We have received complaints. The government must also check such NGOs. We are already a divided country, we can’t afford further divisions.”
Mr Bhutto reiterated the resolve to work with Faisal Edhi. “A revolution in our country is about to come. People are angry. They are fed up with the feudal system. They don’t want feudalism. We need radical reforms but our politicians do not give us radical reforms because we’ve spent the last 75 years dancing between feudalism and capitalism. Yes, in terms of the land that we [his family] have, almost all of it has been submerged. The houses of our haris have also been destroyed. Of course we are always there for the people. We are doing our best to help.”

6,Premiere for revenge crime thriller Carma held,"KARACHI: Now that the weather situation in the city has improved considerably, it seemed appropriate on the part of...","KARACHI: Now that the weather situation in the city has improved considerably, it seemed appropriate on the part of the promotion team of the film Carma to hold its premiere at Nueplex Cinema on Thursday evening. As it usually happens, the event was attended by a good number of film and TV journalists. After all, the movie is dubbed a ‘revenge’ thriller and its director Kashan Admani enjoys a good reputation among his contemporaries as a musician; so his admirers were eagerly waiting to see what he’s done by going behind the camera as a storyteller. 
The cast of the film, which releases nationwide on Friday, includes Adnan Siddiqui, Osama Tahir, Naveen Waqar, Lili Caseley, Paras Masroor, Zhalay Sarhadi, Khaled Anam and Arjumand Rahim. One or two of them were either missing or arrived late for the premiere. Overall, it was a well-attended programme.
The writer and producer of Carma, Fawad Hai, appeared to be the busiest on Thursday interacting with whoever sought his opinion on the film. 
Talking to Dawn about the movie, he said, “It’s a revenge crime thriller. I don’t think such a thing has ever been attempted in Pakistan before. No one has made a revenge crime thriller and I say that because I haven’t seen any such effort. We have a great ensemble cast. The director, my partner Kashan Admani, is also the co-producer of the project.”
On the question of the box office success of the film, because ever since Covid-19 hit the world businesses have been affected by it, he replied, “This is a passion project for us. It would be good to earn money but that’s not our priority. Our priority is to entertain everyone.”
At 9:15pm all the invitees walked into the cinema hall where the movie was shown to them. One of the immediate reactions to the first half an hour or so of the movie, at least of this writer, was: the makers are admirers of American film-maker Quentin Tarantino, someone who has won Oscars as a screenplay writer and yet to win one as director. Reason: his dialogue can be more dazzling than the visuals that he shows on screen.

“In all the relief camps established, the services (being) provided to the pregnant women and other displaced population are poor. Female healthcare providers, including medical officers and staff nurses of Covid-19, are not deployed,” says a notification released by the provincial health department. 
The officials have been directed to deploy gynecologists, medical officers, staff nurses, health visitors – all female-- and midwives at the flood emergency relief camps. 
“Ensure availability of lady health supervisors/workers to facilitate services to female patients/pregnant women. Ensure availability of beds more than two in number to help pregnant women in distress or discomfort.  
“Ensure availability of family planning commodities at all the camps and arrange health education sessions through health education officers and lady health workers,” the notification reads. 
In a video message, the health minister said it (flash floods) was a major catastrophe involving almost all districts and the government faced shortage of staff, medicines, logistics and essential items. 
“I appeal to people to come forward and donate generously for the flood victims,” she said.

9,SHC asks govt to form bodies under judges to monitor relief work,SUKKUR: The Sukkur bench of the Singh High Court has directed Sindh government to form ‘citizen committees’ with...,"SUKKUR: The Sukkur bench of the Singh High Court has directed Sindh government to form ‘citizen committees’ with civil judges as their heads to monitor relief works, set up ‘tent cities’ equipped with all required facilities in every district, and drain out stagnant rainwater from all flooded areas. 
The bench comprising Justices Zafar Ahmed Rajput and Shamsuddin Abbas read out on Friday the decision on a petition filed by a citizen Taj Haider a day before about pathetic post-rain and -flood conditions in Sindh and inhumane treatment being meted out to rain-hit people in relief camps set up by city administrations in different districts of the province. 
The petitioner’s counsel Shabbir Shar informed the court that the victims had been left alone. They were starving and looking for help but the Sindh government had not felt any sense of duty to help them and provide them succor, he said. 
He said that instead of the victims, the relief items had been provided to influential persons and landlords. “How pathetic is it to know that the relief items have been given to influential persons and landlords instead of starving families,” he said. 
The justice asked Sukkur commissioner about the number of people rescued and the kind of facilities provided to the rain-hit people. “Every individual is ready to help the calamity-stricken people in this crucial time. If anyone does not want to help them, then he must be a Pharaoh or Nimrod,” he remarked. 
The court ordered the Sindh government to get the stagnant rainwater drained out from al flooded areas, set up tent cities in every district and provide relief items the victims. There must be a mobile clinic at every tent city, it said. 
The court asked the government to plug the breaches in dykes of the river caused by unusual rise in its flows due to unrelenting heavy rains. The Sindh government should constitute citizen committees, which should include elected representatives and lawyers and civil judges should head and monitor them, said the order. 
The judges ordered the Sindh government to submit a report on the devastation caused by torrential rain and the measures taken to provide relief to the affected people. The court then adjourned the hearing till Sept 7. 
Earlier the bench said in the course of hearing of the petition that over 500,000 people had been rendered homeless by the torrential rain in Sindh and nowhere in the province proper arrangement had been made for sheltering the victims. The calamity-hit people were crying for help but they were not being provided tents, food, safe drinkable water and medicine, said the bench. 
Heavy rain had destroyed crops and killed cattle heads but the provincial and federal governments had not yet started helping the victims in an adequate manner, said the court. 
The bench said that officials of Rangers and health department should visit the tent cities, where, in addition to mobile clinic, lady doctors should be made available for maternity facilities. 
The bench authorised SSP of each district to lodge cases against those who were found misusing relief fund or selling relief items. Furthermore, breaches in dykes should be plugged immediately and no dyke should be breached in future, directed the bench, adding that the citizen committee should also include mukhtiarkar, MS, officials of PDMA and members of the bar association.

10,Kotri Barrage to pass peak of high flood today,"Peak will start to record a fall today, say officials.","HYDERABAD: After reaching state of high flood level on Friday evening, Kotri Barrage is bracing for peak of high flood before the flow is to be released for Indus delta downstream.
The barrage started showing a rising trend at 6pm upstream discharge. Flows of above 70,000 cusec had been received at the barrage over the last 24 hours. By 6pm Thursday (Sept 1), the flow was measured at 437,947 cusecs and 24 hours later it was recorded at 508,102 cusecs upstream. 
The peak would continue till Saturday morning before starting to record a fall, say officials.
“We will be receiving peak of high flood which was passed by Sukkur Barrage on Aug 25,” said Kotri Barrage chief engineer over phone. He appeared confident that the river dykes in his territorial jurisdiction were ‘safe’ and strong enough to withstand the flows.
Insofar as the current peak of 558,218 cusecs passed at Guddu Barrage at 12 noon on Friday, “this will be received at the [Kotri] barrage after a gap of at least a week given time-lag of water travel between three barrages”.
Sukkur Barrage had passed first high flood peak of 579,753 cusecs on August 25 at 6am. Two days earlier (at 6pm on Aug 23), Guddu Barrage had passed a peak of 576,075. “Difference of a couple of thousands of cusecs is due to incessant rains on August 23 and Aug 24 in the area that led to changes in flows,” said Abdul Aziz Soomro, in charge Sukkur barrage control room.
Kotri barrage has a designed discharge capacity of 875,000 cusecs. On Aug 27, 2010 the barrage had successfully passed a peak of 939,442 cusecs during super floods 2010 which breached Tori dyke upstream Guddu barrage on Aug 7 in that year. It had led to large scale displacement of people and left a trail of destruction in right bank districts.
Read: How current calamity compares to 2010 floods
After Kotri barrage passed the peak on Aug 27, 2010, another massive breach occurred at Kot Almo dyke of river in Sujawal same day, inundating large swatches of lands in Sujawal and causing migration of people in areas like Darro.
River discharges at Kotri barrage would keep rising until the peak is passed safely. “Besides recording gauges at [Kotri] barrage we note gauge level at Dadu-Moro bridge as well which delays water arrival,” said Kotri Barrage Chief Engineer Haji Khan Jamali.
Flows released from Manchhar Lake to keep it in safer limits were becoming part of overall flows in Indus river. The lake’s flows were measured at around 10,000 to 15,000 cusecs. “Now river Indus is not accepting huge flows as it is already having very heavy flows. Earlier, a flow of 30,000 cusecs was being easily released from the lake,” said irrigation officer Mahesh Kumar from Manchhar Lake.
The lake is receiving discharges from the Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD) which is known as Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD-I). Breaches had been reported in MNVD, which had received hill torrents and caused breaches in the Flood Protective (FP) bund at multiple locations.
Kotri Barrage, according to CE Jamali, has a 106-mile-long left bank and 111-mile-long right bank dykes. “On the right side of river bank, Kalri Baghar (KB) feeder serves as a common bank for river and the feeder,” he said.
Following heavy rains that triggered urban flooding in Hyderabad district and ravaged rural parts of lower Sindh region, rumours kept churning out that Hyderabad and Latifabad would drown due to upcoming floods in Indus River.
“We are expecting major amounts of floodwater flowing into the barrage this evening. It will maintain rising trend for next few days,” confirmed the CE. He believed a peak of around 500,000 to 550,000 cusecs downstream would pass through the barrage downstream in next few days.
As far as Guddu and Sukkur barrages were concerned, both would be passing a flow of close to 600,000 cusecs over the next 36-48 hours. “The peak that passed earlier at two barrages barrage in the last week of August had flows of waters from hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and flows of Indus, Kabul and Chenab rivers,” said Khalid Idris Rana, the director operations of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).
He said it was purely Indus flows that were crossing Sindh’s three barrages. “Now there are no backflows upstream Guddu which is having 558,218 cusces flows today (Friday),” he said. Guddu would record a fall after 24-36 hours and then this declining trend would be seen at Sukkur Barrage after 24 hours, he added.
“The gradients in Sindh are slow and that’s why water flows are reaching a bit slowly,” Rana said. At this point of time, he said, there was no forecast of a heavy spell of rain.
Taunsa Barrage upstream Guddu had already passed its peak of 622,095 cusecs on Aug 30 at 6am and since then it continued to record a declining trend. At 6pm on Sept 2, Taunsa barrage recorded a flow of 348,208 cusecs upstream and downstream which is almost half the flow it had passed on Aug 30.
