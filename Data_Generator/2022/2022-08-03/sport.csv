0,Heartbreak for Pakistan as Shajar misses out on 100m semis,A personal best for a fourth place finish in his heat wasn’t enough for Shajar Abbas.,"BIRMINGHAM: A personal best for a fourth place finish in his heat wasn’t enough for Shajar Abbas.  
The 22-year-old Pakistan sprinter got knocked out of the race for the men’s 100m semi-finals at the Commonwealth Games in the cruelest of ways possible on Tuesday.  
Running in heat eight at the Alexander Stadium, Shajar clocked 10.38 seconds to finish behind Jamaica’s Conroy Jones (10.28), Adam Thomas of Scotland (10.30) and Trinidad and Tobago’s Eric Harrison Jr (10.37).  
The quirk of the qualifying criteria, however, meant Shajar had to see Jake Doran of Australia, who finished 0.01 seconds slower than him, advance the semi-finals.  
Doran had finished among the top two in the second heat with the 27-man semi-final line-up comprising the first and second finishers in each of the 10 heats and the seven fastest losers.  
It meant Shajar — who was 27th overall among 70 sprinters — missed out by a fraction of a second with Harrison and Buntin Nadale of St Kitts and Nevis, who both finished in 10.37, advancing to Wednesday’s semi-finals.

“I couldn’t get off to a good start but I recovered and was hoping to go through,” Shajar told reporters. “I tried my best but that’s sport for you … I couldn’t finish among the top two but one sprinter who had a worse time than me went through because he had a second-place finish in his heat. 
“I will try to build and improve on this and hope to do well in the next event,” added Shajar, who will also take part in the 200m at the Games. 
Sri Lanka’s Yupun Abeykoon was quickest overall, in a time of 10.06, ahead of Kenya’s Ferdinand Omanyala (10.07).  
“I’m happy to reach the semi-finals and my next goal is to reach the final,” said Abeykoon, the only South Asian sprinter to have broken the 10-second barrier in the 100m.  
There was another personal best for Pakistan’s other sprinter in action on Tuesday but Aneela Ali didn’t even get close to advancing to the semi-finals of the women’s 100m.  
Aneela ended dead last in the fourth heat with her time of 14.01 seconds also seeing her finish 48th and bottom overall among the sprinters who were able to finish.  
Olympic champion Elaine Thompson-Herah confirmed she was the sprinter to beat after running 10.99sec to finish second in the heats behind Nigeria’s Grace Nwokocha.  
Thompson-Herah finished third behind fellow Jamaican sprint stars Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson in the 100m at last month’s world championships in Eugene, Oregon.  
It was a disappointing performance for the 30-year-old, who topped the podium at last year’s Tokyo Olympics in both the 100m and 200m, retaining the titles she had won in Rio.  
But she said she was confident she can reclaim her best form in Birmingham.  
“You have to believe in yourself because no-one else can believe in you,” Thompson-Herah said. “I wanted to do well this year. It’s not on God’s watch. It is on my watch. Whatever time I put together, I will work my way back up to the top. [My plans] are to have fun, smile, breath and just run.” 
Elsewhere on Tuesday, two other Pakistan athletes fell out of the medals race. 
In the pool, Haseeb Tariq clocked 24.65 seconds to finish fourth in his 50m freestyle heat but failed to advance to the semi-finals after he was 43rd overall among 71 swimmers. 
Mehreen Baloch, the first female boxer to represent Pakistan at the Games, was eliminated in the round-of-16 of the 57kg featherweight competition after losing 5-0 to Sajeewani Coorey Muthuthanthri of Sri Lanka. 
BOXER EXCLUDED 
Away from the action, officials of the Pakistan contingent said on Tuesday that they will be seeking compensation from the Commonwealth Games Committee after boxer Zohaib Rasheed’s name was excluded by the technical officials in the draw for the men’s flyweight category. 
“We will not only write to the Commonwealth Games Committee and the International Boxing Association but will also seek compensation by filing a case at the Court of Arbitration for Sport,” an official of the Pakistan Boxing Federation said.
Pakistan harbor hopes of a boxing medal at the Games through Ilyas Hussain, who advanced to the quarter-finals of the featherweight category when he overcame Trinidad & Tobago’s Anthony Joseph on a split decision on Monday night. 
For a place in the semi-finals, Ilyas will take on Northern Ireland’s Jude Gallagher on Wednesday.

1,"Karachi, Lahore  to host England in seven-match T20 series","LAHORE: Karachi and Lahore will host Pakistan’s seven-match Twenty20 International series against England, who are...","LAHORE: Karachi and Lahore will host Pakistan’s seven-match Twenty20 International series against England, who are set to tour the country after 17 years in September, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced Tuesday.
The current world champions will play four Twenty20 Internationals at the National Stadium in Karachi and the remaining three at the Gaddafi Stadium here from Sept. 20 to Oct. 2, and then return for three Test matches in December.
England were scheduled to visit Pakistan in October last year, but they pulled out citing players’ well-being issues days after New Zealand called of their respective visit to the country due “security alerts”.
Both tours were rescheduled not long after the PCB criticised England and New Zealand’s pull-out, with chairman Ramiz Raja claiming a “western bloc” was behind the move. 
New Zealand will play two Tests in Pakistan and a total of 13 white-ball games in December-January and April next year respectively. 
The success of Australia’s first visit to Pakistan in 24 years in March also played a key role in assuring the England and Wales Cricket Board and New Zealand Cricket.  
“We demonstrated our event planning and operational skills in the highly-successful series against Australia in March/April and I am confident we will be able to replicate 
these when England visit us for the first time since 2005,” PCB’s director international Zakir Khan said in a statement.
An ECB security delegation conducted an assessment of venues and potential team accommodations in Multan, Karachi and Lahore in its visit last month after which the tour schedule was decided. 
“We have been able to confirm schedule of the T20Is following a successful tour by the England and Wales Cricket Board recce team, which was pleased and satisfied with all our arrangements,” said Zakir.
ECB’s managing director Rob Key said the board had been “liaising closely” with the PCB over the arrangements for both the T20 and Test tours “will continue to work closely with the PCB, British High Commission and other relevant authorities” to prepare for them. 
“We would like to thank the PCB and the city authorities for all their ongoing assistance with planning for the tours, including hosting the recent pre-tour planning visit by ECB representatives and the PCA CEO,” Key added.
Complete schedule of England Test series as well as New Zealand and the West Indies series — which is set to be played in January next year — will be announced in due course, said a PCB statement.
Schedule: 
Sept. 20: First T20I, Karachi
Sept. 22: Second T20I, Karachi 
Sept. 23: Third T20I, Karachi 
Sept. 25: Fourth T20I, Karachi

2,McKeon dazzles in Commonwealth pool as Kenny wins emotional cycling gold,BIRMINGHAM: Australian swim sensation Emma McKeon won a record-extending 12th gold medal at the Commonwealth Games ...,"BIRMINGHAM: Australian swim sensation Emma McKeon won a record-extending 12th gold medal at the Commonwealth Games on Monday as cycling star Laura Kenny finished her campaign with an emotional gold.
It was another night of domination in the Birmingham pool for Australia, who now have 16 golds at the Sandwell Aquatics Centre out of a possible 33.
McKeon, who powered home in the 50m butterfly, has now won four golds in Birmingham and has collected more overall gold medals than any other athlete in Commonwealth Games history.
The 28-year-old, who won seven medals at last year’s Tokyo Olympics — including four golds — touched in 25.90sec.
“I love a challenge,” said McKeon.  “Just having this huge workload is preparing me for Paris [2024 Olympics] and even though it’s hard workload physically, it’s just training my mind to be able to do that many races back to back. I’m not going to have that many once I get to Paris. It’s just building that self-belief.”
Rising Canadian star Summer McIntosh, who is just 15, won her second gold of the Games, adding the women’s 200m individual medley title to her 400m IM crown.
Australia’s Kyle Chalmers won the men’s 100m freestyle final in 47.51sec after a 48-hour period that he described as  “hell” as a result of intense speculation in the media over his relationships with team members.
Reports suggested a rift with McKeon and Cody Simpson, who is reportedly dating McKeon, Chalmers’s ex-girlfriend.
The 2016 Olympic champion said:  “The lies and false truths getting put out there — it’s nowhere near the truth at all.
“We are great friends and have great support. I am just grateful to be a part of the team and sharing that with every single team member.”
Australian Olympic champion Kaylee McKeown destroyed the field to win the women’s 200m backstroke and Australia rounded off the night in style by winning the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay.
England’s Kenny and Australian Matthew Glaetzer won gold medals in an uplifting final session of track cycling, which was being held in London.
New Zealand’s Ellesse Andrews, in the women’s keirin, and compatriot Aaron Gate, in the men’s 40km points race, both won their third gold medals of the games.
Kenny, who has suffered a miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy since competing at last year’s Tokyo Olympics, admitted she had thought it was  “going to be my last race”.
However, she refocused and won the women’s 10-kilometre scratch on the same track where 10 years ago, aged 20, she won double Olympic gold.
Kenny admitted her confidence had been shaken by a horrific crash on Sunday that had resulted in her team-mate, Matt Walls, being taken to hospital.
“I can’t believe it. Honestly, I said to Jase [Jason Kenny, her husband] ‘I think this is going to be my last race’,” the five-time Olympic gold medallist told the BBC.
“I’ve lost the spark, training doesn’t come that easy. I have absolutely just lost motivation.
“Then last night I was messaging my new coach Len and I was like ‘No, I’m not giving up, I have one more roll of the dice, please just help me’.
“It could not have been better set up if I tried.”
Glaetzer battled back from thyroid cancer to compete at the Olympics.
But after some wretched luck in Birmingham — coming to grief in the keirin and then stripped of his bronze medal in the sprint on Sunday — he won the men’s 1,000m time trial to add to his gold in the team sprint.
“I’m making a habit of bouncing back at the Commonwealth Games,” he said.
“I’d rather not have such lows to come back from, but it shows there is always a new day and we can always try again.”
England extended their domination of the gymnastics competition.
Local boy Joe Fraser battled through the pain of a fractured foot to take gold in the pommel horse while Jake Jarman won the men’s floor to go with his men’s all-around title.
“I can hands down say that was probably the best routine I’ve done in my gymnastics career,” said Jarman.
England’s Courtney Tulloch retained his rings title as Georgia Mae-Fenton took gold in the women’s uneven bars.
Australia’s Georgia Goodwin won the women’s vault.
England have won seven of the nine golds on offer so far in the gymnastics competition.

Bilateral cricket remains suspended between the bitter neighbours who play each other only in multi-team tournaments.
A day after Sri Lanka take on Afghanistan in the opener, India and Pakistan will lock horns in the tournament’s most anticipated match.
The nine-team Twenty20 tournament was shifted to the United Arab Emirates last month due to the political and economic crisis in Sri Lanka, who retain the hosts’ honour.
Pakistan beat India by 10 wickets in a T20 World Cup match in Dubai last year in their previous encounter.
Dubai hosts 10 matches, including the Sept. 11 final, while three will be played in Sharjah, ACC president Jay Shah, who is also the secretary of the Indian cricket board, said on Twitter.

4,Robinson returns to England Test squad for South Africa series,Robinson has himself only recently returned to action after a back problem.,"LONDON:  England have recalled fit again fast bowler Ollie Robinson for the first two Tests of their three-match series against South Africa that starts at Lords on Aug. 17 as a replacement for the injured Jamie Overton.
Robinson has himself only recently returned to action after a back problem and will test his fitness in a four-day game for the England Lions against touring South Africa in Canterbury starting next Tuesday.
Sam Billings, who had been cover for concussed wicket-keeper Ben Foakes, drops out of the squad that beat India by seven wickets last month - a fourth win in a row under the new leadership of coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes.
Robinson’s last Test was against Australia in Hobart in January. He has 39 wickets at an average of 21.28 in his nine appearances to date.
The squad is for the first two matches of the series at Lord’s and then Old Trafford (Aug. 25-29) and will be reassessed ahead of the third and final game at The Oval (Sept. 8-12).
RABADA INJURED
South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has been ruled out of two Twenty20 Inter­nationals against Ireland this week and is also a doubt for the Test series against England as he works his way back from a medial ligament injury in his ankle.
Rabada is a key strike bowler for South Africa in the longer format and his absence would be a huge blow to the tourists hopes of success in the England series.
Cricket South Africa said on Tuesday the 27-year-old would be closely monitored ahead of the Test series but offered no time frame on a potential return to action.
He is definitely out of the T20 games against Ireland that will be played in Bristol on Wednesday and Friday.
South Africa will look to cement their lead in the World Test Championship with a series win against a resurgent England.
England squad:  Ben Stokes (captain), James Anderson, Jonny Bairstow, Stuart Broad, Harry Brook, Zak Crawley, Ben Foakes, Jack Leach, Alex Lees, Craig Overton, Matthew Potts, Ollie Pope, Ollie Robinson, Joe Root.

5,Record-breaking McCoy helps WI level T20 series,BASSETERRE: A record-breaking six-wicket haul by Obed McCoy paved the way for a nervy series-levelling five-wicket...,"BASSETERRE: A record-breaking six-wicket haul by Obed McCoy paved the way for a nervy series-levelling five-wicket win for the West Indies over India in the second T20 International of the five-match series at Warner Park in St Kitts on Monday.
Comfortable winners of the opening encounter in Trinidad three days earlier, India were dismissed for 138 off 19.4 overs with left-arm seamer McCoy returning the outstanding figures of six for 17, the best-ever by a West Indian in T20 Internationals.
Opening batsman’s Brandon King’s 68 set the home side on their way to what looked a comfortable victory before they stumbled towards the end and needed an unbeaten 31 from wicketkeeper-batsman Devon Thomas to reach the target at 141 for five off 19.2 overs.
McCoy, who has endured a succession of injury setbacks in the previous 12 months, looked to be back to his best and gave the West Indies the perfect start when he claimed the vital wicket of Indian captain Rohit Sharma with the first ball of the match.
He also completed his four-over effort with a wicket - Bhuvneshwar Kumar — off his final ball and in between added the scalps of Suryakumar Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Dinesh Karthik and Ravi Ashwin as India’s vaunted batting line-up laboured on pitch offering disconcerting bounce.
“I went into this match with a much clearer mind than the last game,” said McCoy after receiving the ‘Man of the Match’ award.
“I am enjoying the challenge bowling at the start of the innings and at the death and so far I am really learning a lot from these experiences.”
Hardik Pandya topscored with 31 but no-one in the visitors’ line-up was really able to get on top of a disciplined West Indies bowling effort.
King’s polished innings at the start of the West Indies reply came off 52 balls with eight fours and two sixes.
When he was yorked by Avesh Khan in the 15th over though at 107 for four, India looked to tighten the screws, only for Khan to spoil his earlier good work when he bowled a no-ball at the start of the critical final over of the match and Thomas capitalised to take his relieved team across the line.
“We didn’t bat well. We just didn’t apply ourselves, but that can happen,” was Sharma’s assessment of his team’s batting performance.
“But as I have said many times already, when you’re trying to achieve something as a batting group you won’t always succeed, so we aren’t going to change our plans based on this result.”

After slumping to 67-6 off 13 overs in the third and final match, Burl and Jongwe smashed eight sixes and six fours between them off 31 balls to offer hope to the hosts.
Both Jongwe (54) and Burl (35) were dismissed during the penultimate over as they looked to hammer medium-pacer Hasan Mahmud over the ropes.
Zimbabwe finished their 20 overs on 156-8 and, in a tense finish at Harare Sports Club, restricted Bangladesh to 146-8 for a 2-1 series triumph.
A 17-run victory for Zimbabwe last Saturday was followed one day later by a seven-wicket win for the tourists.
The Zimbabwe total was achieved despite losing their regular top scorer, Pakistan-born Sikandar Raza, for a golden duck.
Mahmud and Mehidy Hasan were the pick of the Bangladesh bowlers, both finishing with identical figures of 2-28 off four overs.
Always slightly behind the required run rate, Bangladesh reached 131-6 off 18 overs, leaving them requiring 26 runs to snatch victory in the match and the series.
Victor Nyauchi, one of three changes to the Zimbabwe team convincingly beaten on Sunday, restricted Bangladesh to seven runs in the penultimate over.
Needing 19 off the final over, Jongwe held his nerve with the ball to secure the win for Zimbabwe. Afif Hossain finished as Bangladesh’s leading scorer with an unbeaten 39 off 27 deliveries.
Nyauchi took three wickets and Brad Evans, another change after the second T20 loss, claimed two for Zimbabwe, who have won seven of eight matches in the shortest format since the beginning of July.
The change in fortunes after 3-0 T20 and ODI whitewashes at home to Afghanistan coincided with the appointment of former star Houghton.

7,South American countries set to launch official 2030 World Cup bid,MONTEVIDEO: Four South American countries were set to launch an unprecedented joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup ...,"MONTEVIDEO: Four South American countries were set to launch an unprecedented joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup on Tuesday, with the hope of bringing the global showpiece back to its first home.
Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and Chile’s intention to bid has long been in the making.
More than three years ago they committed to create a local organising committee to co-ordinate with South American football’s governing body CONMEBOL to plan their bid.
But it has taken until now for the  “Juntos 2030” (Together 2030) bid to be made official.
It centers on the desire to  “bring the World Cup back to its original home: South America,” said CONMEBOL president Alejandro Dominguez.
The very first edition of the World Cup in 1930 was held in Uruguay and won by the hosts, beating their neighbors Argentina 4-2 in the final.
The joint South American bid aims to stage the 2030 final in the very same Centenario stadium that hosted the first title match 100 years earlier.
“For us it should be called the 2030 Centenary World Cup,” said Uruguay’s sports minister Sebastian Bauza.
“What we have to focus on is the Centenary World Cup. The 100 year celebration of the first World Cup will be here. Back to the legend, back to its roots!” Should it be successful, though, the two tournaments could not be more different.
In 1930 there were only 13 teams and the entire tournament was played in the same city — Montevideo — in just three stadiums.
In 2030 there will be 48 teams with around 15 stadiums used across the four countries.
If successful it would be the first time that as many as four countries host the World Cup.
The 2026 tournament has already been awarded to three countries — Canada, Mexico and the United States.
Despite the Latin American region being one of the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic, Chile’s sports minister Alexandra Benado insisted in an interview published on Monday that all four countries remain in a position to host the tournament.
“Our proposal will be austere and sustainable and will meet FIFA’s demands,” Benado told El Mercurio newspaper.
The joint South American bid will likely come up against at least two other proposals.
Spain and Portugal have officially submitted a joint bid while Morocco have repeatedly insisted they will bid to become only the second ever African country to host the finals.
The United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland decided in February to abandon a joint bid that would have seen five FIFA member federations hosting the tournament.
There has also been tentative talk of an Israeli bid alongside the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
The last World Cup to be hosted in South America was Brazil 2014.
More than half of the 21 World Cup finals already staged have been in Europe but later this year Qatar will host the finals, only the second time they will be in Asia.

8,Jota signs new long-term contract with Liverpool,"LIVERPOOL: Forward Diogo Jota has signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool, the Premier League club said on...","LIVERPOOL: Forward Diogo Jota has signed a new long-term contract with Liverpool, the Premier League club said on Tuesday.
Liverpool did not disclose the length of the deal but British media reported the Portugal international has signed a five-year extension, keeping him at Anfield until 2027.
Jota helped Liverpool win the FA Cup and League Cup last season, while they finished second in the Premier League just a point behind Manchester City and reached the Champions League final, which they lost to Real Madrid.
The 25-year-old arrived at Anfield from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020 and has scored 34 goals in 85 appearances for the reds in all competitions.
“What Diogo has brought to this team and this club since he arrived is there for all to see, so it is really good news that he has signed a new contract,” Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp told the club’s website.
“I have said before that Diogo is the player we hoped he would be but also a little bit better, so long may this continue.”  Jota joins team-mates Mohammed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jordan Henderson, Virgil van Dijk and Fabinho in committing his long-term future to the club.
He is currently recovering from a hamstring injury that has curtailed his pre-season and is set to miss Liverpool’s Premier League opener at promoted Fulham on Saturday.
“Unfortunately for me I had an upset in this pre-season because I got injured (in the) last game of the season playing with Portugal,” Jota told the club website.
“So I was coming back in this pre-season, I felt it a little bit again. It will be a few more weeks, I would say.
“When you fight for everything, like we did last year, you just want to do it again and to do it better, because it’s possible. That drive is in me and I know it’s in my team-mates and ... We have everything to fight for those titles out there.”

World number 12 Kasatkina won 11 of the last 12 games to win 1-6, 6-2, 6-0 in Rybakina’s debut match since winning her first major title.
Kasatkina will next play American Taylor Townsend, who eliminated Australian Storm Sanders 6-1, 6-4 at the US Open hardcourt tuneup event.
After 23rd-ranked Rybakina rolled through the opening set in 35 minutes, Kasatkina dominated the final two.
American Madison Keys, the 2017 US Open runner-up, defeated China’s Zhang Shuai 6-4, 6-2 to book a second-round date against Tunisian Ons Jabeur, who lost to Rybakina in last month’s Wimbledon final.
Japan’s Naomi Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam champion, and American sixth seed Coco Gauff would meet in a second-round matchup if both win their openers.
Former world number one Osaka will face China’s Zheng Qinwen while 18-year-old Gauff, this year’s French Open runner-up, meets Anhelina Kalinina of Ukraine.
Osaka, whose ranking has slid to 41st, has not played since losing her first-round match at the French Open. She had suffered a right ankle injury in a tuneup event at Madrid.

Fifteen-time major champion Woods has always made clear his opposition to the series which is threatening to tear golf apart and triggered accusations of Saudi  “sportswashing”.
Speaking in an interview on Fox News with Tucker Carlson, LIV chief executive Norman was asked if it was true that the American golf legend was offered  “700, 800, a billion dollars” to join the breakaway circuit.
“That number was out there before I became CEO so that number’s been out there, yes,” Norman, a former world number one who is the public face of LIV Golf, said in the interview at Trump National in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the third LIV Golf Invitational was held last weekend.
“And look, Tiger is a needle-mover, right? So of course you are going to look at the best of the best.
“They had originally approached Tiger before I became CEO, so yes, that number is somewhere in that neighbourhood.” The 46-year-old Woods has consistently declared his loyalty to the PGA Tour and said he has no intention of following the likes of other major winners, such as Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Sergio Garcia and Dustin Johnson in jumping ship to the upstart LIV.
“I disagree with it,” Woods said ahead of the British Open in St Andrews last month when asked about his fellow professionals who have been tempted to join the hugely lucrative but deeply controversial circuit.
“I think that what they’ve done is they’ve turned their back on what has allowed them to get to this position,” Woods said.
“And who knows what’s going to happen in the near future with world-ranking points, the criteria for entering major championships?  “Some of these players may not ever get a chance to play in major championships. That is a possibility. We don’t know that for sure yet.” The LIV series, spearheaded by Norman and bankrolled by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, offers record prize money of $25 million per 54-hole event with shotgun starts and no cut.

11,"Murray, Venus lose in Washington Open first round",WASHINGTON: Three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray of Britain crashed out in the opening round of the ATP and ...,"WASHINGTON: Three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray of Britain crashed out in the opening round of the ATP and WTA Washington Open on Monday, falling to Sweden’s Mikael Ymer.
The 35-year-old Scotsman fell to 115th-ranked Ymer 7-6 (10-8), 4-6, 6-1 after two hours and 50 minutes at the US Open tuneup tournament.
“I’m excited,” said Ymer, who saved four set points in the first set.  “A lot left to do but it’s a very good start of the American swing.”
World number 50 Murray, the 2012 and 2016 Olympic champion, is trying to earn a seeding at the US Open, which he won a decade ago.
“It’s still possible,” Murray said. “I would just need to have a good run in Canada or Cincinnati really. It’s pretty straightforward if I was to make a quarter-final or a semifinal, which right now — after a loss like that — doesn’t seem realistic.
“I do feel like if I play very well that I could do that. But I’ll need to certainly play better than I did today.”
Seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams, playing her first singles match in nearly a year, was also eliminated in the opening round, falling to Canadian qualifier Rebecca Marino 4-6, 6-1, 6-4.
“It was nice to have the crowd behind me,” Venus said.  “Definitely a great experience. It’s my first match so I didn’t think I played well a lot of the times.
“Just trying to shake off some rust. That’s just to be expected. All I can do is just play another tournament and play better.”
Venus had not played a WTA singles match since falling to Taiwan’s Hsieh Su-wei 49 weeks ago in Chicago.
Ymer, who lost his only career ATP final last August in Winston-Salem, will next face 15th seed Aslan Karatsev.
Ymer won 75 percent of his first-serve points, 49-of-65, and smashed 37 winners past Murray, who made only 25 with 35 unforced errors, five more than Ymer.
Murray had a set point in the 12th game of the first set but sent a backhand wide and Ymer held into a tiebreaker.
Murray had three more set points in the tiebreak but Ymer smashed two forehand winners and a forehand volley winner to pull level at 7-7, prompting Murray to toss his racquet in frustration. Ymer, 23, took the set on a backhand volley winner.
“Had chances in the first set to close that out,” Murray said.  “Didn’t get it. Yeah, frustrating.”
While Murray clawed back to force a third set, Ymer raced to a 4-0 lead, they exchanged breaks on double faults and Ymer ended the match on a backhand crosscourt winner.
Two-time Grand Slam champion Simona Halep, coming off a Wimbledon semi-final run, beat Spanish qualifier Cristina Bucsa 6-3, 7-5.
“Always the first round is difficult when you change the surface,” third seed Halep said.  “I know it’s going to take time to make the game more solid.” US top seed Jessica Pegula cruised 6-2, 6-2, over US wildcard Hailey Baptiste.
Pegula won the most recent WTA Washington event in 2019 after two missed years due to Covid-19.
“It definitely feels weird,” Pegula said.  “It’s great to be back.”
Britain’s Kyle Edmund made a triumphant return to ATP singles after three left knee surgeries and a 20-month layoff by defeating Japanese qualifier Yosuke Watanuki 6-4, 7-6 (10-8).
