1,Prices of life-saving drugs may see around 7pc increase,Official rejects rumours regarding 20pc hike in cost of medicines.,"ISLAMABAD: In contrast to speculations regarding an exorbitant rise in the cost of medicines due to inflation, it is expected that prices of life-saving drugs will be increased by 7pc whereas other medicines prices may witnesses a hike of up to 10pc in light of the 2018 drug pricing policy.
As per the Drug Pricing Policy 2015, the prices of medicines were allowed to be increased in relation to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). 
But in 2018, changes were made to the drug pricing policy which said that though the hike will correspond with the CPI, in case of double-digit inflation, the increase will not be more than 7pc for lifesaving drugs and 10pc of the max retail price (MRP) for other medicines.
An official of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), requesting anonymity, said after the announcement of the CPI at 12.65, the prices of lifesaving medicine can increase by 50pc of the CPI i.e. up to 7pc increase.

Official rejects rumours regarding 20pc hike in cost of medicines

Similarly, the prices of non-scheduled drugs can be increased by up to 70pc of the inflation rate whereas threshold drugs’ prices can witness a 100pc increase in sync with the CPI.
However, the 2018 drug pricing policy has bound pharmaceutical companies not to increase the prices of lifesaving and other drugs by more than 7 and 10pc of the retail price, respectively.
“In other words, lifesaving drugs having a retail price of Rs100 cannot be sold above Rs107 and non-scheduled drugs of Rs100 cannot be sold over Rs 110,” the official said, adding that the companies will have to inform Drap about the hike.
The official disclosed that prices of at least 10,000 medicines out of the total 70,000 registered medicines have been increased so far.
However, Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) spokesperson Sajid Shah ruled out even a 7pc increase, saying the government was encouraging competition among pharmaceutical companies which would hopefully keep prices in check.
“A number of companies have been selling medicines at 20pc to 30pc lower rates compared to maximum retail prices allowed to them. However, some of the companies which have a monopoly in the market, sell their products at a maximum price rate. Such products are called orphan drugs,” he added.

On Tuesday, the private respondents submitted their statements in the court. The counsel for both the official and private respondents sought reasonable time from the court to resolve the controversy with an assurance that they would do the needful in this regard.
PMA AJK chapter president Dr Wajid Ali Khan, who is also chairman of the doctors’ Joint Action Committee, maintained that his community was performing their duties with full devotion and sincerity to serve the masses and was not involved in any violation of law or regulations governing their profession.

This was stated by Nong Rong, Ambassador of China to Pakistan, at a dialogue on ‘Global development & governance’ themed on ‘Governance experience exchange between Pakistan and China’ which was organised by Pakistan-China Institute (PCI) and the Academy of Contemporary China and World (ACCWS).
The ambassador said China was eager to support Pakistan in pursuing its development model appropriate for the circumstances on the ground because the two countries were all-weather friends. Through CPEC, China is also eager to expand its exchanges in the area of governance such as lowering poverty levels and raising peoples’ standards of living.
He praised the Communist Party of China (CPC), whose initiatives have profoundly changed China. 
He said the upcoming 20th congress of CPC would make plans for the future and set new objectives that would be accomplished by working together to benefit all peoples. China and Pakistan are strategic allies that have consistently stood by one another through tough times.
The dialogue was moderated by Mustafa Hyder Sayed, Executive Director PCI, and Lin Kun, Vice President ACCWS.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, Chairman of the Defence Committee of the Senate and PCI, extended congratulations to China on the 95th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) which was specially celebrated at the GHQ as a gesture of goodwill. He lauded the close cooperation between Pakistan Army and the PLA, including the comments by COAS General Qamar Javed Bajwa that both armies are ‘brother in arms’.
Referring to US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Asia and tentative plans for a journey to Taiwan, Senator Mushahid said this would be an unnecessary and unwarranted provocation, adding such a high level visit by an American official violate the One-China Policy agreed to by the United States and China in the Shanghai Communique.
He said such provocations had the potential to destabilise Asia and generate a new type of confrontation, something Asia cannot afford in these challenging times. Pakistan, he said, is firmly committed to the One-China Policy and preserving, promoting and protecting the strategic partnership with China.
He also discussed President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative, which he termed the 21st century’s most important development and diplomatic initiative. He said that CPEC, the BRI’s flagship undertaking, was progressing admirably since it has modernised the nation’s infrastructure and raised the socioeconomic standing of its citizens. 
He quoted two studies by the Harvard University. The first study, ‘Understanding CCP resilience: surveying Chinese public opinion through time, was published by the Ash Centre for Democratic Governance and Innovation of Harvard University in July 2020. The study found that there was very high satisfaction with the central government in China. 
The second study by Graham Allison of Harvard University was titled “The great tech rivalry: China vs the US.”
The study shows that China has replaced the US as the world’s top high-tech manufacturer, producing 250 million computers, 25 million automobiles and 1.5 billion smartphones in 2020. Moreover, it says that beyond becoming a manufacturing powerhouse, China has become a serious competitor in the foundational technologies of the 21st century: artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, quantum information science (QIS), semiconductors, biotechnology, robotics and green energy.
Gao Anming, Vice President and Editor-in-Chief of China International Communications Group (CICG), stressed deepening high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative and actively promoting the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Global development is inseparable from connectivity and open cooperation.
The joint construction of the “Belt and Road” pursues development, advocates win-win results, and conveys hope. As a landmark project in the joint construction of the “Belt and Road,” the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is a practical example of win-win cooperation between the two countries.
