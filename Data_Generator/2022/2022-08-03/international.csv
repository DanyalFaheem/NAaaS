0,An air of doubt and disbelief in Kabul,"“We have experienced such propaganda in the past and there was never anything in it,” says a resident.","KABUL: Many Afghans expressed shock or doubt Tuesday that Al-Qaeda’s chief had been killed in Kabul by a US drone strike, saying they couldn’t believe Ayman Al-Zawahiri had been hiding in their midst.
“It’s just propaganda,” said Fahim Shah, 66, a resident of the Afghan capital.
Late on Monday, US President Joe Biden announced Zawahiri’s assassination, saying  “justice has been delivered” to the Egyptian with a $25 million bounty on his head.
“We have experienced such propaganda in the past and there was never anything in it,” Shah said.
“In reality, I don’t think he was killed here.” The Taliban admitted earlier Tuesday that the US had carried out a drone strike, but gave no details of casualties — and did not name Zawahiri, who was considered a key plotter of the 9/11 attacks on the United States.
On Sunday, the interior ministry had denied reports of a drone strike, but Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said Tuesday that was because an investigation was underway.
Kabul resident Abdul Kabir said he heard the strike Sunday morning, but still called on the United States to prove who was killed.
“They should show to the people and to the world that ‘we had hit this man and here is the evidence’,” Kabir said.
“We think they killed somebody else and announced it was the Al-Qaeda chief... there are many other places he could be hiding -- in Pakistan, or even in Iraq.” The strike is sure to further sour already bitter relations between Washington and the Taliban, which pledged to stop Afghanistan from being a sanctuary for militants as part of the agreement that led to the US troop withdrawal last year.
University student Mohammad Bilal was another who thought it unlikely Zawahiri had been living in Kabul.
“This is a terrorist group and I do not think they will send their leader to Afghanistan,” Bilal said.
“Leaders of most terrorist groups, including the Taliban, were either living in Pakistan or in the United Arab Emirates when they were in conflict with former Afghan forces,” he said.
A straw poll, however, found some believers in the capital.
Kabul housewife Freshta, who asked not to be further identified, said she was shocked to learn of Zawahiri’s killing.
“It’s so uncomfortable to know that he was living here,” she said.
A shopkeeper who also asked not to be named said he too wasn’t surprised.
“Any terrorist group can enter our land, use it and get out easily,” he said.
“We don’t have a good government. We are unable to protect ourselves, our soil and our property. “

1,Who can succeed Zawahiri as Al Qaeda’s leader?,"Here are some top contenders to take over the militant organisation, according to experts.

The...","Here are some top contenders to take over the militant organisation, according to experts.
Saif Al-Adel
The mysterious, low-key former Egyptian special forces officer is a high-ranking member of Al Qaeda.
The US is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to his arrest.
Al-Adel was suspected of involvement in the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981, and left the country in 1988 to join the mujahideen fighting Soviet occupation in Afghanistan.
One of al Qaeda’s leading military chiefs, and often called the third-ranking al Qaeda official, al-Adel helped to plan the bomb attacks against the American embassies in Nairobi and Dar as Salaam in 1998 and set up training camps for the organisation in Sudan, Pakistan and Afghanistan in the 1990s.
In 2004, al-Adel’s diary was recovered during a raid in Saudi Arabia. His role in the organisation has been as a trainer, military leader and member of bin Laden’s security detail.
Before joining Al Qaeda he was a member of Egypt’s Islamic Jihad organisation, which was bent on toppling the state.
Al-Adel was linked to the killing of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl in Pakistan in 2002, U.S. investigators said in a report.
The findings by investigators of the Pearl Project revealed al-Adel had discussed Pearl’s abduction with Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, also known as KSM, the accused mastermind behind the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
Al-Adel was appointed caretaker leader after the death of bin Laden.



 
Abd Al Rahman Al-Maghrebi 
Moroccan-born Abd al-Rahman al-Maghrebi is wanted for questioning by the FBI in connection with his membership in Al-Qaeda. He studied software programming in Germany before moving to Afghanistan where he was selected to manage al Qaeda’s main media wing, said the FBI. The son-in-law of Zawahiri, he is a senior Al Qaeda leader.
Documents recovered in the operation that killed Bin Laden indicated al-Maghrebi had been a rising star in the group for many years. He served as Al Qaeda’s general manager in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Yezid Mebarek
Known as Abu Ubaydah Yusuf al-Anabi, Yezid succeeded as emir of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb in 2020, when a French raid killed his predecessor, after running one of the group’s leadership councils and sitting on another.
An Algerian citizen, Mebarek ran media operations for AQIM, using a 2013 video to call for global attacks against French interests after Paris sent troops to help quash a militant insurgency in Mali.
Mebarek, 53, pictured in one photograph with a full grey beard and green turban, is a veteran of Algeria’s 1990s civil war between the government and Islamist forces, rising through the ranks of a militant splinter group, the GSPC.
AQIM took advantage of chaos across the Sahel region to become one of the global network’s most active and valued branches, kidnapping Westerners and staging attacks across swathes of territory.
As a mark of AQIM’s importance to Al Qaeda, Mebarek’s predecessor as its chief Abdelmalek Droukdel, served a role in the global movement’s leadership team under Zawahiri, before being killed by French forces in 2020.
However, analysts believe AQIM has lost sway to newer militant groups in the Sahel, one of the world’s most important arenas of jihadist activity, while Mebarek is reported to suffer from old injuries and to lack the charismatic pull of Droukdel.

2,UN experts slam Israel’s ‘harassment’ in West Bank,"""Israeli authorities’ hubris is proving without limits,"" they say in a joint statement.","GENEVA: UN experts on Tuesday slammed Israel’s  “harassment” of human rights defenders and humanitarian workers in the occupied West Bank’s Masafer Yatta villages, where Israel has a military zone.
The special rapporteurs insisted such harassment must stop, and said residents continue to be threatened by the risk of forcible transfer, including mass forced evictions and arbitrary displacement.
“Israeli authorities’ hubris is proving without limits. They are even harassing human rights defenders and humanitarian workers seeking to support and protect people facing grave human rights violations in Masafer Yatta,” the four experts said in a joint statement.
“This is a direct assault on the core of human rights and international humanitarian law... this also confirms that impunity over abuse of power fosters power to abuse.”
The case of Masafer Yatta — or Firing Zone 918 — an agricultural area near Hebron, has been one of Israel’s longest running legal battles.
In the early 1980s the army declared the 30-square-kilometre territory a restricted military area and claimed it was uninhabited. Residents of eight villages had been in court for around 20 years fighting Israeli government efforts to evict them.
But in May this year, Israel’s High Court approved the eviction of Palestinian villagers to make way for a military training zone.
“The tragic implications of that decision are now before our eyes: roughly 1,200 Palestinian residents in Masafer Yatta are left defenceless in front of the threat of forced eviction and arbitrary displacement,” said the experts, who do not speak for the United Nations but are mandated to report their findings to it.
The statement was penned by a special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory as well as rapporteurs on internally displaced persons, adequate housing, and the situation of human rights defenders.
They voiced dismay at reports that human rights defenders and humanitarian workers have been harassed by the Israeli military in Masafer Yatta.
“They have been stopped and detained for several hours at checkpoints and had their identification documents or cars confiscated, often on grounds that they had entered a closed military site without permission,” their statement said.
The experts expressed particular concern for Sami Hureini, a prominent human rights defender and member of the  “Youth of Sumud” activist group  “engaged in peaceful resistance against illegal settlements in the southern Hebron hills”.

3,"Sadrists told to quit parliament, but keep protesting",Supporters of powerful preacher Moqtada Sadr have been occupying parliament for four days.,"BAGHDAD: A top official from Iraq’s Sadrist movement called on Tuesday on followers who have occupied parliament for four days to move their protest outside, as calls mount for dialogue between political rivals.
Supporters of powerful preacher Moqtada Sadr — whose political bloc in October won the largest share of seats in elections — stormed parliament on Saturday to protest against a rival Shiite faction’s pick for prime minister.
Nearly 10 months on from the elections, the oil-rich country still has no government and no new prime minister or president.
A standoff pits the two key factions of the Shia political scene, between the populist Sadr with a devoted following of millions, and the powerful pro-Iran Coordination Framework. While Sadr’s bloc resigned in June ostensibly in a bid to unblock the impasse, the situation has only deteriorated since then.
Mohamed Saleh al-Iraqi, a senior Sadr loyalist, called on protesters to  “leave parliamentary headquarters” and join fellow Sadrists at an  “encampment in front of and around the building”.
The announcement caused confusion in parliament, where some officials said the instructions were to only leave the main chamber and another meeting room, but that protesters could stay on in the large entrance hall.
On Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of protesters continued to lounge in armchairs and on carpets in parliament, a journalist said.
In the surrounding gardens, protesters have erected tents, while mobile food stalls have sprung up to serve food and drinks. Cows were tied up to a post and a butcher manned a sand. Protesters should leave the inside of parliament within 72 hours, Sadr ally Iraqi added, in a message on Twitter. “The pursuit of the sit-in is very significant because it will solidify your demands,” he said, recommending that protesters rotate their presence at the site.

4,Lanka dismisses India’s concerns on Chinese ship,Says the ship is coming only to refuel and replenish supplies.,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka on Tuesday brushed aside Indian concerns over a scheduled visit by a Chinese ship, saying it was coming only to refuel and replenish supplies.
The research and survey ship Yuan Wang 5 is due to dock in the Chinese-run Hambantota Port, in southern Sri Lanka, on August 11, according to analytics website MarineTraffic.
Indian media reports said that New Delhi was worried the vessel would be used to spy on its activities and that it had lodged a complaint with Colombo.
Sri Lankan government spokesman Bandula Gunawardena said that the cabinet discussed the ship’s visit on Monday and that it would still be allowed to dock.
“Both India and China are helping us at this very crucial time when we are facing an unprecedented economic crisis,” Gunawardena said.
“The President (Ranil Wickremesinghe) informed the cabinet that this matter will be diplomatically resolved by talking to all sides. Both are important friends.”

5,Scientists call for more research into ‘climate endgame’,PARIS: The world must prepare for a  “climate endgame” to better understand and plan for the potentially...,"PARIS: The world must prepare for a  “climate endgame” to better understand and plan for the potentially catastrophic impacts of global heating that governments have yet to consider, scientists warned on Tuesday.
Climate models that can predict the extent of global warming depending on greenhouse gas emissions are increasingly sophisticated and provide policymakers with an accurate trajectory of global temperature rises.
What is less well explored is the cascading impact of certain events, such as crop failures and infrastructure loss due to extreme weather events, which are made likelier to occur with every degree of warming.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) outlined what is currently known about  “catastrophic outcomes” and found gaping knowledge gaps.
Writing in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, they proposed an international research agenda to help governments plan for  “bad-to-worst cases”.
These included four main areas of concern — what the authors termed the  “four horseman” of climate change: famine and malnutrition, extreme weather, conflict, and vector-borne diseases.
“Irreversible and potentially catastrophic risks caused by human induced climate change must be factored into our planning and actions,” said Johan Rockstrom, PIK director and a study co-author.
He said that the more research is done on Earth’s climate tipping points — such as the irreversible melting of the ice caps or the Amazon rainforest turning from a carbon sink to source — showed the ever-greater need to factor in high-risk scenarios into climate modelling. “Key is to do the math of disaster, in order to avoid it,” he said.

6,Truss makes U-turn on pay plan in first big misstep,Britain’s foreign minister forced to backtrack on one of her most striking pledges a day after announcing it.,"LONDON: Britain’s foreign minister Liz Truss, the frontrunner to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister, was forced to backtrack on one of her most striking pledges a day after announcing it following a backlash from fellow Conservatives and opposition parties.
In the first big misstep of her campaign, Truss set out plans to save billions of pounds a year in government spending in a pledge opponents said would require cutting the pay of public sector workers, including nurses and teachers, outside of the wealthy southeast of England.
Truss had said late on Monday she would introduce regional pay boards rather than having a national pay agreement, tailoring pay to the cost of living where people actually work.
But after criticism on Tuesday, Truss said:  “I never had any intention of changing the terms and conditions of teachers and nurses. But what I want to be clear about is I will not be going ahead with the regional pay boards.”  The U-turn came as a poll showed Truss with a smaller lead over her rival Rishi Sunak than previously thought.
A survey of 807 Conservative Party members by Italian data company Techne carried out July 19-27 found Truss was backed by 48pc, compared with 43pc for former finance minister Sunak.
The result suggests a much tighter race than a previous poll of Conservative members carried out by YouGov on July 20-21, which gave Truss a 24-point lead over Sunak.
Truss’s public sector pay plan had faced criticism from the main opposition Labour Party and some Conservative lawmakers.
The Conservatives won the biggest majority in three decades at the 2019 national election by upending conventional British politics and winning in more industrial areas in central and northern England with a pledge to reduce regional inequalities.

Video on social media showed students at the Florets International School in Kanpur reciting prayers that included texts from four major faiths — Hinduism, Islam, Christianity and Sikhism. Several rightwing Hindu outfits and Hindu parents held street protests in the city at the weekend.
Religious conversion has long been a flashpoint in India, which is majority Hindu but also has the world’s second-largest Muslim population.The school is in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh state, which last year passed a law criminalising all religious conversions without prior state approval — legislation that critics said was targeted against Muslims.

9,700 migrants cross Channel in one day,"LONDON: Almost 700 migrants and asylum seekers crossed the Channel to Britain in a single day this week, a new ...","LONDON: Almost 700 migrants and asylum seekers crossed the Channel to Britain in a single day this week, a new record for the year, the UK government said on Tuesday.
The latest arrivals suggest the government’s controversial policy to deport those attempting the dangerous crossing to Rwanda has so far failed to deter them.
The defence ministry said 696 migrants arrived on 14 small boats on Monday, the highest daily tally in 2022 and only the second time this year it has topped 600.
Large groups of people, including young children, were reportedly brought ashore at Ramsgate, on the Kent coast in southeast England, before being taken by bus to processing centres.
More than 17,000 people have arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel — one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes — in small boats so far in 2022, according to government figures.
More than 28,500 — most of them young men — arrived on British shores last year. The all-time daily record of 853 was set in November 2021.
The number of crossing fluctuates through the year, depending on weather conditions and enforcement action along the northern French coastline.
In a bid to deter the arrivals, Britain earlier this year unveiled a new policy to send those crossing for processing and permanent resettlement in Rwanda.
However, the first flight due to take off in mid-June was grounded due to legal challenges, and the policy remains stalled.
Britain has been sending France tens of millions of euros annually to help stop the boat crossings, including for extra beach patrols and equipment such as night-vision goggles.
The Times reported this week that interior minister Priti Patel is set to announce the latest financial deal with Paris, despite questions over the arrangement’s value for money.
It has drawn consistent criticism from some ruling Conservative MPs, with one senior lawmaker telling the newspaper that Patel was  “throwing more good money after bad”.
Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, the two Conservative rivals bidding to succeed Prime Minister Boris Johnson, have both vowed to maintain the Rwanda policy.

10,Seven decades of China-Taiwan tensions,Tensions have spiked between China and the United States over a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.,"TAIPEI: As tensions spike between China and the United States over reports of a planned visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, this news agency looks back at relations between the self-governing island and its much bigger neighbour.
1949: separation: Mao Zedong’s communists take power in Beijing in October 1949 after defeating Chiang Kai-shek’s Kuomintang (KMT) nationalists in a civil war. The KMT flee to the island of Taiwan and form their own government in Taipei in December, cutting off contacts with mainland China.
In 1950, Taiwan becomes an ally of the United States, which is at war with communist China in Korea. The US deploys a fleet in the Taiwan Strait to protect its ally from possible attack.
1971: Beijing gets UN, US nods: In October 1971, Beijing takes over China’s seat at the United Nations, previously held by Taipei. In 1979, the United States cuts formal ties with Taiwan and establishes diplomatic relations with Beijing instead.
Washington expresses support for the  “One China” policy, which states that Taiwan is part of China, but maintains trade and military ties with Taipei.
1987-2004: relations improve: 
In late 1987, Taiwan residents are for the first time permitted to visit mainland China, allowing families to reunite.
In 1991, Taiwan lifts emergency rule, unilaterally ending a state of war with China. The first direct talks between the two sides are held in Singapore two years later. But in 1995, Beijing suspends talks in protest at a visit by Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui to the United States.
In 1996, China tests missiles off Taiwan to deter voters in the island’s first democratic presidential election.
In 2000 elections, the KMT loses power in Taiwan for the first time. Over the next few years trade links between the two sides improve.
2005-2015: threats and talks: In March 2005, Beijing adopts a law authorising the use of force if Taiwan declares independence. In April, KMT chairman Lien Chan makes a landmark visit to Beijing for talks with Chinese leader Hu Jintao.
In 2008, Taiwan and China resume high-level talks after the KMT’s Ma Ying-jeou is elected president on a Beijing-friendly platform.
In 2010, they sign a sweeping Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement and in 2014 hold the first government-to-government talks since separation.
2016: honeymoon over: In January 2016, Tsai Ing-wen, from the traditionally pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, wins presidential elections.
In June, China suspends all communications with Taiwan after the new government fails to acknowledge the  “One China” policy.
In December 2016, US president-elect Donald Trump breaks with decades of US diplomatic policy by speaking directly, by telephone, with Tsai.
In January 2019, Xi Jinping warns that the unification of China and Taiwan is  “inevitable”.
2021: US-China tensions: In 2021, Chinese military jets make hundreds of incursions into Taiwan’s defence zone. In October, US President Joe Biden says the United States will defend Taiwan if China attacks it, in comments later partly walked back by the White House.
Tsai confirms that a small number of US troops are present in Taiwan to help train its forces.
2022: Furore over Pelosi tour: On May 23, Biden urges the West to stand firm against Russia over Ukraine to deter China from trying to take Taiwan by force, and repeats that the US will defend Taiwan in the event of an invasion.

11,S. Korea develops nanotech tattoo as health monitoring device,DAEJEON: South Koreans may soon be able to carry a device inside their own bodies in the form of a bespoke tattoo...,"DAEJEON: South Koreans may soon be able to carry a device inside their own bodies in the form of a bespoke tattoo that automatically alerts them to potential health problems, if a science team’s project bears fruit.
Researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in the city of Daejeon southwest of Seoul have developed an electronic tattoo ink made of liquid metal and carbon nanotubes that functions as a bioelectrode.
Hooked up to an electrocardiogram (ECG) device or other biosensor, it can send a readout of a patient’s heart rate and other vital signs such glucose and lactate to a monitor. The researchers eventually aim to be able to dispense with biosensors.
“In the future, what we hope to do is connect a wireless chip integrated with this ink, so that we can communicate, or we can send signal back and forth between our body to an external device,” said project leader Steve Park, a materials science and engineering professor.
Such monitors could in theory be located anywhere, including in patients’ homes.
The ink is non-invasive and made from particles based on gallium, a soft, silvery metal also used in semiconductors or in thermometers. Platinum-decorated carbon nanotubes help conduct electricity while providing durability.
“When it is applied to the skin, even with rubbing the tattoo doesn’t come off, which is not possible with just liquid metal,” Park said.
