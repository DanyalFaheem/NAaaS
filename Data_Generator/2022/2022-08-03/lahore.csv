Kisan Board Pakistan central vice-president Amanullah Chattha told a press conference the government had failed to check artificial shortage and blackmarketing of urea compost since the last Rabi season.
This, he said, led to a drop in wheat production and was the dollar-starved government was forced to import 3.0 million tonnes of grain from abroad to meet the local output shortfall.
The forthcoming paddy crop because of the continuing compost shortage along with a hike in its price as one 50-kg bag of urea was available against at least Rs2,700 while its official rate is Rs1,950 per bag, he warned.
Any cut in rice production would be a plunge in the surplus crop available for export and result in a fall in foreign exchange earnings, he cautioned.
He stressed that the government should devise a mechanism in which the supply of urea fertiliser from its manufacturing units to farms is traceable for an effective check on hoarding and black-marketing of the commodity.
The Kisan Board leader lamented that instead of resolving the issues being faced by the farmers, the government was increasing diesel prices at the dictation of the IMF and making farming in the country unfeasible.

15,Work afoot on change in land status under Ruda project,The govt has started working out the charges for land use conversion in the existing industrial zone.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has started working out the charges / rates for land use conversion in the existing industrial zone falling within territorial jurisdiction of the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project.  
The Board of Revenue (BoR) will soon accomplish this job after which the owners of over 800 industrial units may get the status of their factories / units land changed from agriculture to industrial or commercial by paying the requisite fee, Dawn has learnt. 
“At a recent meeting, we have been told that the BoR is currently working to assess and finalise the rates, fees or charges for the conversion of our land use status. Let’s see what decision the board takes,” Mian Kamran, Ravi Industrial Estate Association Senior Vice Chairman Mian Kamran, told Dawn.  
According to Kamran, the industrial area falling within the Ravi project revenue limits consists of around 7,300 acre, out of which 2,500 acre have over 800 industrial units manufacturing steel, aluminum, pipes etc. On the remaining land (4,800 acre), Ruda plans to develop an industrial estate in collaboration with the business community.  
“The status of 2,500 acre where the industrial units exist at present is mentioned as agriculture in the revenue record. And Ruda plans to change category / nature of this land to commercial or industrial since there is no agricultural activity in the existing industrial zone,” Kamran explained. 
“The association, a few months ago, had also urged Ruda to impose the land use conversion charges according to DC rate of agricultural land. But our request was not entertained,” he maintained. Later, Ruda forwarded the matter to the BoR, the province’s apex revenue and relief authority, to work out the charges for the land use conversion in the industrial zone. 
The Ravi industrial zone, previously, was not considered to be a regulated industry in Lahore. However, after launch of the Ravi project, the government first decided to shift this zone to another place over which the association launched protest demonstrations, forcing the government to change its decision subject to some conditions.  
During various meetings with the association office-bearers, the industry owners agreed to pay Rs525,000 per kanal fee in installments to Ruda for carrying out development work in the existing zone. 
Similarly, the industry agreed to pay Rs30,000 processing charges and per sq feet fee for the approval of building plans / maps. “Ruda, initially, also tried to convince us of paying 20 per cent of the total value of the land as land use conversion charges. But we requested it to better go for a new formula for the land use conversion fee which is being worked out by BoR at present,” he maintained. 
Meanwhile, at a recent meeting, the Ruda authorities have told the association office-bearers about the land use conversion fee that will be imposed by Ruda after being assessed and finalised by the BoR in near future. During meeting it was also decided to speed up the units’ registration with Ruda in a bid to collect development charges from them. 
The matter related to launch of infrastructural development work in the industrial zone was also discussed at the meeting. The Ruda authorities told the association that the delay was due to a massive increase in the material cost. “Now we have received new rates as per existing situation. And soon we will update the PC-1,” reads minutes of the meeting.

PPP Punjab general secretary and parliamentary leader in Punjab Assembly Syed Hassan Murtaza said here on Tuesday that the PTI launched a malicious campaign on social media against the state institutions by paying huge emoluments to the social media activists from the illegal funding it had collected from foreign companies and individuals, even those from India. 
“The PTI’s social media operators continued to receive money from the prohibited funding,” he added. 
Reacting to the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision on PTI’s funding, he said former prime minister Imran Khan had proven to be ‘dishonest’ and ‘liar’ by the ECP verdict. He said the one who would accuse others of their involvement in a foreign conspiracy himself turned out to be the product of a foreign conspiracy. 
“The election commission’s decision proved that Imran Khan was launched to destroy Pakistan.” 
The PPP leader demanded that such a ‘certified’ liar should not be allowed to do politics. 
Mr Murtaza asked why an Indian citizen funded the PTI from Singapore. It had been proved, said Murtaza, that Imran Khan was spreading chaos and hatred in Pakistan by taking funds from foreigners. The narrative of the PTI leaders after the ECP verdict on the illegal funding case was nothing but ‘shamelessness’, he said.

20,"Ex-MPA Chohan, others remanded in judicial custody","Court directs police for medical examination of ex-legislator, his son","LAHORE: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Tuesday sent PML-N leader Nazir Ahmad Chohan, his son and six others on judicial remand.
Ex-MPA Mr Chohan was first arrested in the case of an armed clash between the PTI and PML-N workers during by-election for PP-167.
Mr Chohan is among the 25 PTI dissident lawmakers (including five on reserved seats) who voted for Hamza in the Punjab chief minister’s election in April and subsequently were de-seated by the ECP.
PTI had won 15 seats out of 20 general seats in the by-elections and succeeded in making PML-Q Parvez Elahi as Punjab chief minister in the second election for the top job in the province.

Court directs police for medical examination of ex-legislator, his son

On Monday evening, the Lahore police conducted a raid in Chuhng area and arrested ex-MPA Chohan, his son Saad Nazir and six others Abid Ali, Qamar Abbas, Rafaqat Ali, Qasim Ali, Hafiz Rizwan and Faisal Maqbol in connection with attack on PTI leader Khalid Gujjar.
The police also registered a second case against the ex-MPA, his son and body guards under sections 324, 353, 186, 506-B, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 at the Chung police station on Aug 1 for attacking a raiding team.
According to the FIR, police received information about Chohan’s whereabouts as he had already been nominated in a separate case. When he was pulled over, he disembarked from his vehicle and straightened his right hand in which he was allegedly carrying a pistol, it said.
Armed individuals accompanying Chohan also disembarked from another vehicle and allegedly opened fire on police, the FIR stated, adding that officials “saved their lives by laying flat on the ground”.
On Tuesday, the police had presented Chohan, his son and six others before an anti-terrorism court to seek physical remand.
The investigating officer said a case under terrorism charges was also registered against ex-MPA in Chuhang police station for opening fire and attacking policemen who raided to arrest him in a case.
He said the suspects were carrying heavy arms and they had [allegedly] attacked the police party to avoid the arrest.
He appealed to the court to give physical remand of the suspects to recover arms from them.
Chohan’s lawyer told the court that a case was registered against ex-MPA at the Johar Town police station and he was proven innocent in it.
He said there was no basis to arrest his client and he was nabbed on “political grounds.”
Meanwhile, Chohan along with his son showed marks of torture on their body parts and he told the court that police had not allowed him to take medicine from home after the arrest.
They also appealed for their medical examination.
ATC Judge Abhar Gul Khan directed the police to work under the law and rejected their plea for physical custody.
The court also directed the police to conduct a medical examination of Chohan and his son and also sent the ex-MPA and all others to jail on a 14-day judicial remand.
After the hearing, Nazir Chohan addressed the media and said that a judicial commission should be constituted to investigate the case against him.
He said he was not present when the police raided his house and nominated him in another case registered in the Chuhng police station.
He said he was present at Raiwind Road when the police raided his house. The police also tortured him and the SHO had snatched his car, mobile phone and Rs5 million. He appealed to Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to take notice of the incident.
Special Assistant to Prime Minister Ata Tarar, Khwaja Salman Rafique and Khwaja Imran Nazir also visited the ATC to show solidarity with Chohan.
