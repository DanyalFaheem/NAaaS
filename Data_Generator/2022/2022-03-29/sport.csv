0,Verstappen-Leclerc shaping up as F1 rivalry of 2022,JEDDAH: Two races into the Formula One season and defending champion Max Verstappen is already going toe-to-toe with...,"JEDDAH: Two races into the Formula One season and defending champion Max Verstappen is already going toe-to-toe with Ferrari rival Charles Leclerc rather than veteran Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time F1 champion whose crown he took last year. 
Verstappen and Leclerc, both 24 and rivals since their karting days, went wheel-to-wheel on Sunday, before Verstappen made a decisive pass three laps from the end of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix for his first win of the season and 21st of his career, while Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz was third ahead of Sergio Perez in the second Red Bull. 
“Every battle is different,” Verstappen said. “It’s just smart racing and good racing. It was not easy but a lot of fun.”
The race under floodlights was held two days after an attack on a nearby oil depot by Yemen’s Houthi rebels. 
Hamilton is F1’s record holder with 103 wins, but managed one meagre point for Mercedes in 10th. 
“It’s gutting but we’ll keep working hard and keep fighting, that’s all we can do,” Hamilton said. “Right now we’re not fighting for the top. We’re so far off the guys ahead. It feels like a long, long way away.”
Leclerc was aiming for back-to-back victories after winning the season-opener in Bahrain from pole position last Sunday. 
After coming close, Leclerc congratulated his rival on the radio and then gave him a thumbs-up afterward. 
“We’ve been pushing like I’ve rarely pushed before, we take risks. Of course there’s respect,” Leclerc said. “It was hard racing but fair. Every race should be like this. It was fun.” 
Ferrari had opened the season with a one-two last week in Bahrain and Sunday’s win put Red Bull, who drew a blank in Sakhir, back in the game. 
Leclerc, who recorded the fastest lap, leads the overall standings by 12 points from team mate Sainz with 21 races to go. Verstappen is 20 points off Leclerc in third. 
Ferrari continue to lead the constructors’ standings ahead of Mercedes with Red Bull vaulting up to third. 
Leclerc and Verstappen were running second and third after the start. 
Pole-sitter Perez appeared to have the race under control but an unfortunately-timed safety car, just after his pitstop, dropped him behind the Monegasque and his Red Bull team-mate. 
The Mexican lost another place when he was ordered to give up third position to Sainz, who had exited the pits alongside but slightly ahead of the 32-year-old under safety car conditions. 
Leclerc established a comfortable lead over Verstappen as the race resumed and appeared set for a second straight win. 
But a virtual safety car in the closing laps brought the race to life. 
Leclerc and Verstappen swapped the lead several times, as they both tried to be behind the other turning onto the long start-finish straight in an attempt to benefit from the top-speed boost of the Drag Reduction System (DRS). 
Verstappen eventually won the game of “DRS chicken” and swept past his Ferrari rival on the 47th of 50 laps. 
George Russell took fifth for struggling champions Mercedes ahead of Alpine’s Esteban Ocon and McLaren’s Lando Norris with Pierre Gasly taking eighth for AlphaTauri. 
Kevin Magnussen finished ninth for Haas and Hamilton, winner of last year’s inaugural Saudi race, rescuing some pride after starting 15th to claim the final point.

2,Pakistan aim for ODI series win against depleted Australia,Fakhar Zaman says Pakistan is aiming to take home all 30 points up for grabs in the series.,"LAHORE: Pakistan will continue their ICC ODI Super League campaign against a depleted Australian side at the Gaddafi Stadium here on Tuesday with the visitors losing two of their players on the eve of the first of the three-One-day Inter­national series.
Australia, already without key players due to different reasons, have been dealt by an injury to seasoned all-rounder Mitchell Marsh while wicket-keeper Josh Inglis has tested positive for coronavirus.
Placed tenth in the ODI Super League table after just three of their scheduled eight series played, Pakistan will look to make the most while Australia — at seven — face a challenge without David Warner, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Steven Smith, who were a part of their 1-0 Test series triumph.
Pakistan opener Fakhar Zaman said the hosts were aiming to take home all 30 points up for grabs in the series. 
“They are missing some big names so that will make a difference,” he said. 
“But it’s an international team and we are not going to take them lightly because Australia is known for doing well in all situations and all circumstances.”
After a hard fought Test series, which included an unexciting draw in Rawalpindi, a thrilling one in Karachi and concluded with a 115-run defeat for Pakistan in Lahore, Fakhar said Babar Azam’s men were only looking forward. 
“Our captain has spoken that what has happened is beyond us... this is a new series so we will do our best to win it,” said the flamboyant southpaw.
For Australia, who have won all of their last seven ODI series against Pakistan, it will be about the less experienced players rising to the occasion.
The 22-year-old Cameron Green did exactly that in the Test series with his all-round capabilities, especially during the last Test. He is expected to be pushed into the white-ball side as the like-for-like replacement for Marsh, who injured his hip flexor during a fielding drill on Sunday.
“Cam will play and probably bat in that middle-order role,” Australia captain Aaron Finch said during the pre-match online press conference. “We have seen he is a super-talented cricketer. He is someone who has been quite consistent in his Test career, his impact with the bat and ball can’t be understated. 
“Really excited for Cam to get that opportunity.”
Finch will also expect performances from new players Sean Abbott, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis and Ben McDermott while also testing his squad’s depth with his eyes on the ODI World Cup, scheduled to be held in India next year.
“We still feel like we have a squad to do that even though it is inexperienced at times that can be a blessing because you have guys who can play freely and express themselves,” said the Australian skipper.
“It’s about trying to build the depth of the squad and build experience in players. 
“It is a really good opportunity. With every decision we make there is one eye towards the 50-over World Cup and to tie everything back to that is really important. 
“Our goal 100% is to win this series.” 
Pakistan are likely to be without leg-spinner Shadab Khan for the first two ODIs, as he recovers from a groin injury he sustained during the Pakistan Super League earlier this year. The national team vice-captain, however, was seen batting and bowling in the nets during Pakistan’s practice sessions.
The hosts’ pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi’s inclusion in the side for the first ODI also remains a question after he was hit on his leg while batting during net practice.
Fakhar said Pakistan will look to score big on what will be batting-friendly pitches in Lahore with the dew factor likely to play its role under lights.
Teams (from):
PAKISTAN: Babar Azam (captain), Shadab Khan, Abdullah Shafique, Asif  Afridi, Asif Ali, Fakhar Zaman, Haider Ali, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali,  Iftikhar Ahmed, Imam-Ul-Haq, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris, Zahid  Mahmood, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Wasim Junior, Saud Shakeel, Shaheen  Shah Afridi, Shahnawaz Dahani, Usman Qadir.

3,North Macedonia game ‘matter of life and death’ for Ronaldo,"""it’s going to be an extremely tough game because if the Macedonians are here, it’s because they deserve to be,"" he says.","PORTO: With a spot on the line for what could be his fifth and final World Cup, Cristiano Ronaldo needs to avoid an upset like the one that ended Italy’s hopes of making it to the tournament in Qatar. 
Portugal face a winner-take-all game on Tuesday against North Macedonia, the team that shocked Italy last week to keep the four-time champions out of the World Cup for the second straight time, and their talisman Ronaldo said it is a “matter of life and death”. 
“The team is quite confident, I feel all the players are ready,” Ronaldo told a press conference on Monday. “For us, this game is a matter of life and death, we are aware of its importance and I take this opportunity to appeal to the supporters to give us incredible support tomorrow.” 
Portugal are trying to reach their sixth straight World Cup, and Ronaldo is hoping to play in his 10th consecutive major tournament after appearing in four World Cups and five European Championships since 2004. 
“We know that if we win we will go to the World Cup and if we lose we are out,” he said. “We have the responsibility to be positive and win the match. I see everyone well prepared and wanting to be at their best tomorrow.” 
Portugal would have likely been expecting to face Italy in the play-off final, but the European champions slumped to a shock 1-0 home defeat by North Macedonia last week. The Macedonians also claimed a surprise away victory over Germany earlier in the qualifying campaign. 
“We’re playing North Macedonia and of course people think it’s going to be an easier opponent,” admitted Ronaldo. “From my point of view it’s going to be an extremely tough game because if the Macedonians are here it’s because they deserve to be. North Macedonia are a very organised team, but if Portugal are at their best, they beat any team in the world.” 
Ronaldo, the all-time record goalscorer in international football, will be 41 by the time of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada. But the Portugal captain was irritated when asked if Qatar would be his last World Cup if Portugal qualified for the finals. 
“I’m tired of those questions. I’m the one who decides my future,” a visibly angry Ronaldo said. “If I want to keep playing, I will. If I want to stop, I will stop. I’m the one who is in charge of those decisions. That’s it.”
The other World Cup qualifying play-off final in Europe on Tuesday sees Poland host Sweden in the southern Polish city of Chorzow, with the Poles looking to end a run of six straight defeats against their opponents.
Poland, who finished second to England in their qualifying group, were given a bye to this game after scheduled semi-final opponents Russia were suspended from all international football until further notice following the invasion of Ukraine.
Sweden, quarter-finalists at the 2018 World Cup, beat the Czech Republic 1-0 in their semi-final with an extra-time Robin Quaison goal.Ten European sides have already clinched a place in Friday’s draw in Doha for the World Cup, with a total of three spots still up for grabs in the play-offs.
Wales will take part in the other play-off final but that is on hold until at least June because the war led to the postponement of Ukraine’s semi-final away to Scotland.

4,"‘It’s crazy’, admits history-making Eritrean cyclist Girmay",BRUSSELS: Eritrean Biniam Girmay said he is still coming to grips with his  “crazy” victory in Sunday’s...,"BRUSSELS: Eritrean Biniam Girmay said he is still coming to grips with his  “crazy” victory in Sunday’s Gent-Wevelgem, which saw him become the first African cyclist to win a one-day classic.
Girmay, who turns 22 next Saturday, was speaking at a press conference the day after his historic success and admitted the glare of publicity was not his thing.
Girmay’s victory was all the more remarkable as he had never previously raced on a cobblestone surface.
“I know where I come from, this victory is crazy!,” opined a smiling Girmay at the press conference held in Zedelgem.
“It was really emotional when I crossed the line, I could not bring myself to believe I had won. I love cycling and winning but cameras are not really my thing, I do not think I am ready for all that.”
Girmay said he had received  “thousands of messages” congratulating him, though he had been unable to reply to them all.
But he has found the time to call his wife back home in the Eritrean capital Asmara.
“I am really keen to go home,” he said. “Family for me is the most important thing, I must look after them.”
According to Flemish channel VRT, Girmay has not seen his wife and daughter for three months. This is due to be remedied as he is taking a flight out of Paris later on Monday.
He also said he wants to continue with his team Intermarche.
Girmay succeeded where other African riders had fallen short before, including his compatriot Daniel Teklehaimanot who briefly donned the polka dot jersey for best climber in the 2015 Tour de France.
Girmay’s victory continued a strong campaign. He won a race in Mallorca at the end of January, then finished 12th in the Milan-San Remo and fifth in the E3 Classic last Friday.

5,Rescheduled West Indies ODIs to be played  in Rawalpindi,"West Indies will arrive in Islamabad on June 5 for the One-Day Internationals on June 8, 10 and 12.","LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Monday that the West Indies will tour Pakistan in June to play three ODIs in Rawalpindi which were postponed due to Covid-19 cases in the tourists’ squad during their visit last year. 
“Rawalpindi will host the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Super League matches against the West Indies at the Pindi Cricket Stadium from June 8-12,” the PCB said in a news release. 
The West Indies will arrive in Islamabad on June 5 for the One-Day Internationals on June 8, 10 and 12. 
The series is part of World Cup Super League from which the top seven countries will qualify directly for next year’s World Cup in India. 
The three ODIs were supposed to be part of the West Indies tour to Pakistan last December, but were rescheduled after five positive Covid-19 cases were reported in the West Indies team, which had to leave the tour after playing three T20Is. 
The PCB added the West Indies have also agreed to play three T20s in Pakistan early next year, “the schedule of which will be announced in due course.”

6,Elgar ‘comfortable’ some key players opted for IPL over South Africa,DURBAN: South African Test captain Dean Elgar said on Monday he was  “comfortable” with the decision of key...,"DURBAN: South African Test captain Dean Elgar said on Monday he was  “comfortable” with the decision of key players to make themselves unavailable for a Test series against Bangladesh, which starts at Kingsmead in Durban on Thursday.
Earlier this month Elgar called for players contracted to the Indian Premier League to put country ahead of club. But all South Africa’s IPL-linked players opted to play in the lucrative Indian franchise tournament, which started at the weekend.
“A lot has happened since my last interview around this topic,” Elgar told a pre-series press conference in Durban. “I’ve had really good, detailed chats with those players to find out where they are mentally with regard to playing in the Tests or in the IPL.”
South Africa will go into the Bangladesh series without their front-line fast bowling attack of Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and Marco Jansen, as well as the injured Anrich Nortje. They will also be without batsmen Aiden Markram and Rassie van der Dussen.
Elgar said he was restricted in what he could say about the issue, but suggested the IPL players had to make a difficult choice after being told by Cricket South Africa that they could choose which way to go.
“I do know that the players were put in a bit of a situation with regards to making a decision on their availability,” he said.
Cricket South Africa has an agreement with the Board of Control for Cricket in India whereby it makes its players available for the IPL.
Elgar said it was time to move on. “They’re not here with us and we have to make do with our next best in the country, which I’m still very confident with. We’ve lost a few Test caps but it’s a great opportunity for those guys to stand up and put those other players under pressure.”
Elgar said that although he was not involved in South Africa’s one-day series defeat against Bangladesh, he shared the hurt felt by the local players which he said would make them hungry to turn the tables in the Test matches.
“We know this is not the Bangladesh side of old,” he said. “It’s a new team with a westernised coaching staff who have obviously changed their mindset with regards to how to play cricket in South Africa. The contest is going to be a good one.”

7,Root’s England facing questions over future,"Ben Stokes, currently England’s vice captain and a close friend of Root, appears to be the obvious successor as skipper.","LONDON: The head coach is gone. The director of the team is gone. The captain might go soon after just one win in 17 Tests over the past 14 months. 
The English cricket team is in disarray, with what can only be described as its winter of discontent capped by a 10-wicket loss to the West Indies on Sunday that sealed a fifth straight series defeat. That came after a 4-0 thrashing by Australia Down Under in the Ashes.A red-ball reset as it has been branded by the England and Wales Cricket Board is underway, apparently. It’s clearly needed given the teams hasty decline in a format that was once king in the English game but now might be something an afterthought given the riches that lie in white-ball cricket. 
But where does the ECB start? There’s so much wrong with the English Test team that surely more pain is coming this summer, when New Zealand and South Africa visit for three-match series either side of India returning to complete a five-match series they led 2-1 last year before the final Test was postponed for coronavirus-related reasons. 
Former captain Kevin Pietersen said the England set-up “stinks”, with Geoffrey Boycott accusing the team of going “nowhere” after their latest humiliating defeat. 
England captain Joe Root said on Sunday he had no intention of stepping down as skipper, with team director Ashley Giles and coach Chris Silverwood sacked following the Ashes debacle. 
And Pietersen, England’s captain from 2008 to 2009, insisted on Monday the fundamental issue was the ability of the squad available to Root, who has skippered the Test side on a record 64 occasions, rather than his much-criticised tactics in the field.
“As a captain you are only as good as your players,” Pietersen told Talk Sport radio.  
“Forget Joe Root, it is about the players. Who is going to do a better job with the calibre of player that is playing Test cricket for England? It is not Joe Root’s fault. Who are you going to pick?” 
Pietersen, 41, added: “When Jack Leach and Ben Stokes put that partnership together at Headingley [in the Ashes] three years ago, Stokes played the innings of his life — I said then Leach is not good enough. 
“He’s not a good enough spinner. And who is second in line, Dom Bess? Are you joking? Don’t point fingers at Root, understand the set-up. The set-up stinks.” 
Ben Stokes, currently England’s vice captain and a close friend of Root, would appear to be the obvious successor as skipper. 
But the 41-year-old Pietersen, a gifted batsman who scored 23 hundreds in 104 Tests, insisted a change of captain would mean little if the team kept suffering top-order collapses. 
“How is he [Stokes] going to do any better than Joe Root?... How are you going to get these guys scoring runs against the best bowlers in the world? 
“Have you seen what’s coming? New Zealand, India, South Africa. How are you going to get these guys scoring 200s? Number one, two, three, four and five, how are you going to get them scoring 200s when they can’t bat?” 
Boycott, another former captain said England, now bottom of the World Test Championship table, were  “going nowhere”. 
“They need a rocket up the backside from a new head coach with some fresh ideas,” Boycott wrote in his Daily Telegraph column. 
“Doing nothing is not an option. Nothing is working,” added Boycott, one of England’s all-time great opening batsmen, who did not spare Root, a fellow Yorkshireman, as he called for a “shake-up” in personnel. 
“The captain, Joe Root, is incapable of lifting these players,” Boycott insisted. “England are not losing because they are unlucky. They lose because they just aren’t good enough.” 
Former England captain Michael Atherton said Root should step down. 
“As was obvious to anyone who was in Australia, and should have been obvious to anyone who wasn’t, Root has reached the end of the road as captain,” Atherton wrote in The Times. 
“A change will not cure all ills — this is a poor team and England are paying the price for the neglect of the first-class game — but there simply comes a time when a captain has nothing new to say, no new methods of motivating his players and a different voice or different style is required. 
“He had reached that point at the end of the Ashes and nothing has changed.” 
Another former skipper, Nasser Hussain, said it was time for a change. 
“The England captaincy was the best job in the world and it is not one you keep doing simply because there is a perception no one else is capable of taking over,” Hussain wrote in the Daily Mail. 
“We’re talking about the England captaincy. It is too important for that.” 
Michael Vaughan said England would lose nothing by replacing Root as captain. 
“What are we going to miss? We are not going to miss his runs because he will keep scoring those,” the former skipper wrote in The Telegraph. 
“Are we going to miss his tactics in the middle? No.”

8,Mancini  to stay as Italy coach despite World Cup failure,FLORENCE: Roberto Mancini will stay on as Italy coach despite the team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup...,"FLORENCE: Roberto Mancini will stay on as Italy coach despite the team’s failure to qualify for the World Cup again. 
Italy, who won the European Championship only eight months ago, lost to North Macedonia 1-0 in the playoffs on Thursday and will now miss a second straight World Cup. The previous failure led to the dismissal of coach Gian Piero Ventura and the appointment of Mancini. 
However, the Italian football federation this time has decided to stick with the coach who revitalised the national team and led them to the Euro 2020 title. The 57-year-old Mancini was given a contract extension through 2026 in May. 
“We need to start again,” Mancini said Monday. “I talked to the president [Gabriele Gravina], we’re in agreement on everything well have time to discuss what we need to improve. 
“I’m still young and I wanted to win a European Championship and a World Cup, well have to wait for the second a little bit. I like this work and I know that with the players we can organise again something important. Apart from the disappointment, everything else is moving forwards.” 
Names including 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro and Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti were touted after Italy’s defeat in Palermo last week. 
After Thursday’s defeat team captain Giorgio Chiellini and Gravina both said they wanted Mancini to continue, and the 57-year-old all-but made a public bid to stay on as boss. 
Mancini introduced an exciting brand of football after taking over from Ventura. 
His team also broke several records, including setting a run of 37 unbeaten matches before losing to Spain in the Nations League finals. And, as Italy prepare to start from scratch again, veteran defender Leonardo Bonucci believes Mancini is once again the right man for the job. 
“What the coach has given us in these three years is something unique,” Bonucci said. “He has created an empathy that is rare to see at Coverciano [the Italy team’s headquarters]. Anyone who has been involved on the pitch, the dressing room or had anything to do with the coach wants only to carry on with him. 
“For us continuing with the coach is just the logical thing to do: his ideas, his human value are unquestionable. The result of a one-off match can change opinions, but those who live this every day only want to continue this path.”
Instead of preparing for a playoff final against Portugal on Tuesday, Italy will play Turkey after that team lost to the Portuguese on Thursday. 
Nine of the Italy players called up for the World Cup playoffs returned to their clubs over the past three days after struggling with physical issues: Marco Verratti, Jorginho, Ciro Immobile, Lorenzo Insigne, Domenico Berardi, Gianluca Mancini, Luiz Felipe, Alessa­ndro Florenzi and Matteo Politano. That should give some of the less experienced a chance to play. 
“We need to start again with a new cycle. We have important matches coming up,” Mancini said. “We will certainly introduce younger players already in June for the Nations League. I hope they will get experience in their club. That’s fundamental.”

9,Fruhvirtova becomes youngest player in Miami fourth round since 2004,MIAMI: Czech teenager Linda Fruhvirtova on Sunday became the youngest player to reach the last 16 of the Miami Open...,"MIAMI: Czech teenager Linda Fruhvirtova on Sunday became the youngest player to reach the last 16 of the Miami Open since 2004 when former world number one Victoria Azarenka retired from their third round match.
The 16-year-old arrived at the tournament with a world ranking of 279 but she dominated the two-time Australian Open winner, racing into a 6-2, 3-0 lead before the veteran Belarusian informed the chair umpire that she was done and walked briskly off the court. 
Azarenka, 32, who broke down in tears during her defeat to Elena Rybakina at Indian Wells earlier this month, looked out of sorts throughout against the impressive Fruhvirtova. 
“I don’t even know how to describe it,” Fruhvirtova said courtside. “It’s what I’ve always dreamed of, playing in these big stadiums in front of so many people. It’s definitely a dream come true.” 
It was not immediately clear why Azarenka retired although later in the evening the former world number one, who also deleted her social media accounts in the wake of her problems at Indian Wells, released a statement citing personal issues. 
“I shouldn’t have gone on the court today. The last few weeks have been extremely stressful in my personal life,” she said. “Last match took so much out of me, but I wanted to play in front of a great audience as they helped me pull through my first match. I wanted to go out there and try but it was a mistake. I hope to take a break and be able to come back.” 
Fruhvirtova advanced to a match with Spanish fifth seed Paula Badosa, who rolled past Kazakhstan’s Yulia Putintseva 6-3, 6-2. 
World number one Iga Swiatek breezed past Madison Brengle of the US 6-0, 6-3 while American Coco Gauff kept alive her bid for a maiden WTA 1000 title, firing off five aces to overcome China’s Zhang Shuai 7-6 (7-1), 7-5. 
Jessica Pegula of the US also made the fourth round, the 16th seed beating 17th-seeded Elena Rybakina 6-3, 6-4. Veronika Kudermetova advanced as well, topping Shelby Rogers of the U.S. 6-1, 7-5, and Petra Kvitova also prevailed. 
On the men’s side, Jannik Sinner saved five match points before advancing past Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta 5-7, 7-5, 7-5 and next faces Australian Nick Kyrgios, who put in a clinical performance to down Italian Fabio Fognini 6-2, 6-4. 
Second seed Alexander Zverev enjoyed a much smoother path to the last 16 as he made short work of American Mackenzie McDonald, winning 6-2, 6-2 in 73 minutes to set up a last 16 meeting with Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis, who came through a tight contest against Denis Kudla 7-6(7-5), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4). 
Frances Tiafoe of the US reached the fourth round in Miami for the fourth time after easing past Juan Manuel Cerundolo 6-3, 6-2. Tiafoe’s next opponent may be seeking family revenge. He’ll now face Francisco Cerundolo, Juan Manuel’s brother, who got a 6-2, 6-3 win over Gael Monfils. 
British number one Cameron Norrie overcame a slow start to beat Frenchman Hugo Gaston 6-3, 7-5 to set up a meeting with world number eight Casper Ruud, who has beaten the Briton on both of their previous meetings. Ruud had little trouble beating Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-2.

10,Canada rout Jamaica to end 36-year World Cup drought,"TORONTO: Cyle Larin, Tajon Buchanan and Junior Hoilett scored as Canada qualified for the World Cup finals for just...","TORONTO: Cyle Larin, Tajon Buchanan and Junior Hoilett scored as Canada qualified for the World Cup finals for just the second time on Sunday, beating Jamaica 4-0 to book their ticket to Qatar and end 36 years of failure and heartache. 
“Speechless. Dream come true,” midfielder Jonathan Osorio said. “We all dreamed of this as little kids, and as a Canadian that was impossible. Today the impossible happened. It’s an incredible feeling.” 
Canada missed out a chance to secure a spot in Qatar last week with a 1-0 loss to Costa Rica. It was Canada’s first loss in three World Cup qualifying rounds and it snapped a six-game winning streak. 
Boosted by the home crowd at BMO Filed, Canada rebounded in a big way against the Jamaicans, who were already eliminated from World Cup contention. 
Following the match the fans broke into the Canadian national anthem and Osorio led the crowd for a drum chant before the team danced on the field. Buchanan circled the field waving Canadas flag. 
Canada coach John Herdman became the first coach ever to lead both a men’s and women’s team to a World Cup berth. He coached the Canadian women’s team from 2011-18. 
In a post-game interview Herdman was doused with champagne by Canadian goalkeeper Milan Borjan. 
“Canada is a football nation, man. We better believe it,” Herdman said. “And we’re going to keep coming. We’ve only gotten started.” 
While Canada celebrated, Mexico and the United States will have to wait to learn their fate despite picking up wins along with Costa Rica, who also kept their Qatar hopes alive. 
The United States got a hat-trick from Chelsea midfielder Christian Pulisic as they romped to a 5-1 home win over Panama while Mexico needed a 70th minute goal from Edson Alvarez to win 1-0 and avoid a humiliating draw with winless Honduras. 
The victory for Canada puts the leaders on 28 points in the CONCACAF qualifying group, three points ahead of the United States and Mexico. 
Costa Rica won 2-1 at El Salvador to maintain fourth place with 22 points and prevent the US from being able to clinch on Sunday night. Anthony Contreras scored on a bicycle kick in the 30th minute, Christian Gil tied the score one minute later and Joel Campbell put the Ticos ahead in the first minute of first-half stoppage time. 
The top three teams earn automatic places in November’s World Cup with the fourth-place finisher facing an Oceania team in an intercontinental playoff for another berth. 
Mexico will host El Salvador on Wednesday, the United States travel to San Jose to take on Costa Rica and Canada wrap up their campaign against Panama. Both Mexico and the United States require only a draw to seal an automatic berth. 
After failing to clinch a finals spot away to Costa Rica, Canada returned home with renewed purpose and a chance to complete the job in front of a frenzied, red-clad, flag-waving, sold-out crowd of nearly 30,000 at BMO Field. 
Larin put Canada in front early with his team-leading 13th goal of the qualifying tournament. He had another clear chance in the 38th minute but the ball went just wide. 
Larin is one goal behind Ali Mabkhout of the United Arab Emirates for most goals in qualifying for Qatar. 
Buchanan scored in the 44th, celebrating with a backflip, to put Canada up 2-0 going into the break. 
Hoilett added the final goal in the 82nd and an own goal in the 88th to round out scoring. 
“I’m just so pleased we didn’t win in Costa Rica,” said Herdman. “This is how it was meant to be, I know why the football gods wouldn’t let us score, it was for tonight. 
Canada will play at the World Cup for the first time since 1986 in Mexico, where they lost all three games and failed to score a goal. 
“We’ve been through some tough times,” Herdman said. “I’ve knocked on doors to ask for money for this team, and we did it. And we just kept believing. I think this country never believed in us because we’ve given them nothing to believe in. They believe now. This is the time for everyone to get behind football and unite because we can be a powerhouse.”
