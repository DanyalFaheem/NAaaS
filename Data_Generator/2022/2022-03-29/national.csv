Traffic on the KKH remained suspended for about 10 hours, stranding passengers.
It is to mention here that Ganish and Nagar Khas villagers claim ownership of a 20-kilometre area near Attabad.
The case over land ownership is pending in court.
Officials said the residents of Ganish village took a body to Dongas, the disputed area, for burial. However, the people of Nagar Khas also gathered there and tried to stop the burial, claiming both the parties were bound not to interfere into the disputed land under an agreement reached a few days ago.
The police said a clash took place between the two groups with members of both the parties pelting stones at each other.
The clash continued for hours, blocking the KKH.
Police fired tear gas and fired in the air to disperse the people.
Hunza SP Tahira Yasub received a minor injury when a stone hit her head. She was shifted to a hospital.
Meanwhile, Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts, FC and police personnel were deployed in the area to control the situation.
Elders also started negotiations between the groups to settle the dispute peacefully.

1,SC irked by Imran’s remarks about Nawaz wooing judiciary,"If the PM has no confidence in the highest forum, how can his members have confidence in him: Justice Mandokhel.","ISLAMABAD: Taking exception to the statements made by Prime Minister Imran Khan about the judiciary at a public meeting a couple of days ago, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel on Monday wondered if the premier could restrain himself from “irresponsible” utterances. 
“If the prime minister has no confidence in the highest forum, how can his members have confidence in him,” Justice Mandokhel observed. 
The observation came during the hearing of a presidential reference seeking interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution. Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel regretted  that the prime minister in his speech at a public gathering in Kamalia had alleged that attempts were being made to woo judges. 
On Saturday, while addressing a large public meeting, PM Khan had said that if former prime minister Nawaz Sharif returned to the country, he would divide the judiciary, which, in fact, he had started doing and the signs are visible in the judiciary. 

Justice Mandokhel asks how defection can ‘damage’ parliament if one party’s loss is another’s gain

Justice Miankhel regretted that this statement was not only discussed widely on social media, but published in the mainstream media as well. 
However, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, who headed the five-judge Supreme Court bench, observed that the court cannot bar political parties from making statements, adding such rhetoric influenced people outside, but not judges.
Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan argued that even if Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution, which dealt with the disqualification of lawmakers for life, was kept aside the element of floor-crossing was destructive to parliamentary democracy, and looking at the country’s parliamentary history, the Constitution had always considered defection a devastating act. 
Question of defection
Justice Mandokhel, however, questioned that when defection by members damages one party but proves beneficial to another, how could such an act be against parliament, adding that it seems the reference had been instituted to keep a check on lawmakers.
The CJP observed that Article 95, which dealt with the no-confidence motion against the prime minister, also lays down that when a certain number of members resign and the ruling party loses majority, the prime minister could be asked to take a vote of confidence again even if the opposition’s no-confidence motion fails. 
Justice Munib Akhtar observed that the Constitution recognised the concept of minority since a country can have a prime minister who did not enjoy a majority from day one, but wondered if a president could ask a premier if he had the majority vote. However, Justice Mandokhel cited the example of Balochistan where a government was functioning with the support of the opposition, observing that if other parties in parliament were willing to declare that defection under Article 63-A of the Constitution entailed disqualification then let parliament decide, especially when the AGP was presenting the point of view of a particular party. 
The AGP argued that lawmakers had a fiduciary relationship with their parties, while parties in turn had a fiduciary relationship with voters, adding that elected members were bound by party discipline.

2,Opposition still figuring out who to blame for losing ‘Q’ support,"Insiders say PPP, PML-N leaders unhappy over Maryam Nawaz's ""inflexibility"" in talks with ‘Q’ league.","LAHORE: Hours after the PML-Nawaz-led opposition submitted a no-confidence motion in the provincial assembly against Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, the ruling PTI unleashed what appeared to be the long-promised ‘trump card’ by nominating PML-Q leader Parvez Elahi as its candidate for the provincial chief executive’s slot.
Sources say PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz is being blamed for the party losing out on the potential support of the ruling coalition’s important ally, the PML-Q. A poor offer to the Chaudhrys is said to be the main reason for the allies not backing the opposition in its efforts to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan through a no-confidence motion.
Read: Sacrificing Buzdar may be the right move but has left the PM with little time to keep his position intact
“Nawaz Sharif and his daughter are being blamed by some leaders in the PPP and PML-N for not showing flexibility in conceding the PML-Q’s demands,” a senior leader in the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), who was part of the parleys with the PML-Q, told Dawn on Monday.

Insiders say PPP, some ‘N’ leaders unhappy over Maryam’s ‘inflexibility’ in talks with ‘Q’ league

“The PML-Q leadership wanted the chief minister’s slot for the remaining term (of the incumbent assemblies), and up to 20 seats in the next term. The PPP top leadership — Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari — agreed to these demands, but the elder Sharif and Maryam were not ready to budge,” the leader disclosed, adding that the father-daughter duo had conveyed to the Chaudhrys that Mr Elahi could be considered for Punjab’s top position only for an interim period of three to five months, after sending the PTI government home.
There was no final understanding between them on seat adjustment for the next polls. 
Mr Zardari is reportedly upset with the Sharifs for not agreeing to a more lucrative offer to the Chaudhrys, which eventually resulted in the PML-Q announcing its support for PM Khan, who offered what his allies wanted.
Another opposition leader said the huge trust deficit between the Sharifs and the Chaudhrys could not be bridged despite vigorous efforts by PPP co-chairman Zardari. 
A PML-N insider said the party leadership was also concerned about Mr Elahi’s “political manoeuvering”. “There is a growing concern among the top leadership that if Mr Elahi is given the chief minister’s position he will consolidate his party at the cost of the PML-N,” he said.
Meanwhile, Yousuf Raza Gilani told Dawn that the joint opposition had not lost hope with the Chaudhrys and was still engaged in parleys with them. “We have the required numbers to oust the prime minister, yet we want the government allies to support the no-trust motion against the premier. We are hopeful that the PML-Q leadership will eventually join us,” he maintained.
PML-N Punjab information secretary Azma Bokhari also said the opposition was still in contact with the Chaudhrys and that they could review their decision about backing the prime minister.
Meanwhile, reports of a rift among the Chaudhrys are emerging over a decision to remain part of the coalition, as Mr Shujaat wants to shake hands with the PML-N, but Mr Elahi sees the PTI as a better option owing to the CM offer.

3,Bilawal plays down ‘neutrality edge’,Says PPP has been fighting against Imran Khan’s govt since day one.,"KARACHI: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has rejected the notion that the opposition is riding a wave of ‘neutrality’, stressing that “we have to put up a fight with or without a neutral”. 
“The PPP has proved it throughout history that whether there was neutral or not, we have to put up a fight. We must snatch our space,” he told Adil Shahzeb of DawnNews in an interview on Monday. 
“Institutions were not neutral when Gen Zia was the dictator, but we still fought. Institutions were not neutral when Musharraf was in power, but we still continued our political struggle.” 

 





 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari made these remarks as opposition legislators launched a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan in parliament on Monday.  
The house will begin a debate on the motion on Thursday and a vote is to be held within seven days. 

Says PPP has been fighting against Imran Khan’s govt since day one 

The opposition and analysts claim the prime minister had fallen out with the powerful establishment, which is not taking sides these days — or is simply neutral. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the opposition’s struggle was not new, as they had been fighting against the present government since day one. “We have been fighting this battle with an understanding that whether there is a neutral or not, we have to fight the battle of democracy… [and] parliament. We have to fight the people’s war.”
He said the biggest test of neutrality was the no-confidence motion, adding that it would be in the country’s interest if all institutions worked within their constitutional framework.
“The PPP has been struggling for three generations. One or two steps forward, one step back… but we have been continuously making efforts to ensure democracy continues in Pakistan.”
Talking about the PTI’s public meeting in Islamabad on Sunday, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said it was evident from the premier’s speech that “he was trembling”.
“Khan Sahib was standing in Parade Ground, sweating buckets … while reading from a paper,” he said. “It was clear that he was scared and upset. And I think whoever is in government is facing a similar situation. 
“We are preparing for a democratic victory and defeat the ‘selected’,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari said, using a euphemism for Mr Khan to mean that he was nurtured and supported by the establishment.

4,Court seeks police report on Sindh House storming,Judge expresses displeasure over the police's failure to submit a report.,"ISLAMABAD: A local court on Monday asked the police for a report in connection with the application filed by a Pakistan Peoples Party’s MNA seeking identification and arrest of suspects who had attacked the Sindh House.
On March 18, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers and workers stormed the Sindh House, Islamabad, to protest against the dissident members of the party who had been staying inside the building, which is managed by the government of Sindh.
The protesters broke the gate of Sindh House. After half an hour of the protest, the Islamabad police had arrived at the scene and arrested a number of protesters including some PTI MNAs.
Later, PM’s spokesperson Shahbaz Gill reached the police station and got the arrested people freed.
A case was registered with the Secretariat Police Station under sections 186, 188, 147, 149 and 422 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
PPP’s MNA Abdul Qadir Mandokhel had filed an FIR, but police inaction into the case led him to file an application with the additional district and sessions judge (ADSJ).
In his application, Mr Mandokhel stated that the suspects had attacked Sindh House and harassed lawmakers and their families. 
He said that police not only failed to protect the premises of Sindh House but also released the arrested people under pressure of the prime minister’s advisers and ministers.
ADSJ Farrukh Fareed expressed displeasure over the police failure to submit a report into the case.
He issued a notice to the police afresh and adjourned the proceedings of the case till Tuesday (today).
