0,Historic summit with Arab states to ‘deter’ Iran: Israel,"Talks bring together FMs of UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Egypt on Israeli soil for the first time.","SDE BOKER: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the top diplomats of Israel and four Arab states wrapped up a landmark meeting on Monday vowing to boost cooperation which, Israel said, would send a strong message to its arch foe Iran.  
The talks brought together for the first time on Israeli soil the foreign ministers of the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco — which all normalised ties with the Jewish state in 2020 — and of Egypt, a country formally at peace with Israel since 1979.  
Israel’s Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said that “this new architecture, the shared capabilities we are building, intimidates and deters our common enemies” — first and foremost Iran and its proxies. “They certainly have something to fear,” he said about Iran, a country Israel is fighting in a regional shadow war and which it accuses of seeking a nuclear bomb, a goal the Islamic republic denies pursuing.  

Talks bring together FMs of UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Egypt on Israeli soil for the first time

UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan called the two-day gathering “historic” and said that “what we are trying to achieve here is changing the narrative, creating a different future”.  
The meeting’s Sunday opening, in the Sde Boker kibbutz in the Negev desert, was marred by a shooting attack in northern Israel that killed two police officers.  
Iran nuclear deal 
The talks on restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal were high on the agenda at the Negev gathering and in Blinken’s meetings with Israeli officials.  
The European Union’s foreign policy chief said at the weekend that an agreement with Iran to restore the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action could be reached “in a matter of days”. That has raised concern in Israel and across much of the Middle East, where many US-allied Arab states view Iran as a menace.  
An Israeli official, speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity, said after the Sde Boker talks: “All countries here except the US have reservations about a nuclear deal with Iran and what happened is that we got them closer to our approach.”  
Blinken on Sunday stressed that Israel and the US “see eye-to-eye” on the core issue of stopping Iran from ever getting a nuclear bomb, despite their differences on the JCPOA.  
The UAE and Bahrain formed ties with Israel under the Abraham Acc­ords, brokered by former US president Donald Trump. Morocco then re-established relations with Israel under a separate Trump-brokered agreement.  
Israeli leaders have argued that the normalisations highlight a changed Middle East, where Arab leaders are no longer compelled to isolate Israel over its unsolved conflict with the Palestinians.  
The Abraham Accords infuriated the Palestinians, who argued that they marked a betrayal of a decades-old Arab League consensus.  
A small group of protesters outside the Negev venue sought to force the Palestinian issue into the room, waving placards that said “Haven’t you forgotten someone?”  
Antony Blinken — who departed Israel on Monday afternoon for Morocco — has voiced strong support for the Abraham Accords but cautioned that they cannot replace Israeli-Palestinian peace-building.  
“We have to be clear that these regional peace agreements are not a substitute for progress between Palestinians and Israelis,” said Blinken, who had on Sunday met Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.  
Blinken has insisted that President Joe Biden’s administration is committed to repairing Palestinian relations, which collapsed under Trump.

1,"Russia plans attacks on humanitarian routes, says Ukraine",Moscow says it is preparing to restrict entry into Russia for nationals of “unfriendly” countries.,"KYIV: Ukraine said on Monday it was pausing evacuations of civilians from war-scarred regions of the country because intelligence reports suggested invading Russian troops were planning attacks on humanitarian routes. 
“Our intelligence has reported possible provocations by the occupiers on routes of humanitarian corridors. Therefore, for reasons of public safety, we are not opening humanitarian corridors today,” Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a statement on social media. 
Meanwhile, Moscow said on Monday it was preparing to restrict entry into Russia for nationals of “unfriendly” countries, which include Britain, all EU states and the United States. 
“A draft presidential decree is being developed on retaliatory visa measures in response to the ‘unfriendly’ actions of a number of foreign states,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in televised remarks. 
Ukraine warned the hum­anitarian crisis in the pulverised city of Mariupol was now “catastrophic”, with thousands dead, as fighting surged around Kyiv ahead of new face-to-face peace talks with Russia in Turkey. 
A senior Ukrainian official said on Monday that around 5,000 people have been buried in the besieged city of Mariupol. But the burials stopped 10 days ago because of continued shelling,” Tetyana Lom­akina, a presidential adviser now in charge of humanitarian corridors, said.

2,The slap seen and heard  across Hollywood,"LOS ANGELES: When Will Smith marched onto the Oscars stage and smacked Chris Rock, the unpredictable moment served ...","LOS ANGELES: When Will Smith marched onto the Oscars stage and smacked Chris Rock, the unpredictable moment served as a jarring interruption to Hollywood’s feel-good celebration. 
But once Smith returned moments later to accept his first-ever Academy Award, he delivered a tearful apology for an act sure to overshadow his milestone achievement. He seized the opportunity during Sunday night’s awards to speak on being a fierce defender just like his tennis dad character Richard Williams from King Richard. 
Smith felt like the protector of many including his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, after Rock made a joke about her appearance that didn’t sit right with him. The exchange began when Rock took aim at Pinkett Smith’s shaved head, saying, “Jada, I love you. G.I. Jane 2, can’t wait to see it, all right? 
Rock’s reference was made from the 1997 film G.I. Jane, starring Demi Moore, who shaved her head to portray a fictional Navy Seal candidate. 
Pinkett Smith revealed in 2018 that she was diagnosed with alopecia. She has often discussed the challenges of hair loss on Instagram and other social media platforms. 
The joke missed, badly.
Smith walked onto the stage from his front-row seat and took a swing at Rock with an open palm, generating a loud smack. Smith walked back to his seat and shouted for Rock to leave Pinkett Smith alone. Rock replied that he was just making a G.I. Jane joke and Smith yelled back at him a second time. 
Smith shouted at Rock to “keep my wife’s name out of your (expletive) mouth”, and the crowd hushed as it became clear this was no act. 
The moment shocked the Dolby Theatre audience and viewers at home. At the commercial break, presenter Daniel Kaluuya came up to hug Smith, and Denzel Washington escorted him to the side of the stage. The two talked and hugged and Tyler Perry came over to talk as well. 
Smith shared what Washington told him: “At your highest moment, be careful because that’s when the devil comes for you.” 
“I’m hoping the Academy invites me back,” Will Smith said as he concluded his on-stage remarks. 
A representative for Chris Rock didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 
After the show, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences issued a statement saying it does not condone violence of any form. 
The Los Angeles Police Department also said in a statement that it was aware of the incident but the individual involved had declined to file a police report. “If the involved party desires a police report at a later date, LAPD will be available to complete an investigative report,” it added. 
“That was the greatest night in the history of television,” Rock said before resuming his role as presenter. 
A few minutes later, rapper Sean Combs on stage to introduce a tribute to The Godfather tried to play peacemaker and suggested Smith and Rock settle their differences at an Oscars after-party. 
Will and Chris, were going to solve that like family at the Gold party, Combs said.
The reverberations did not stop there. Several people approached Smith and Pinkett Smith in the commercial breaks that followed; Keith Urban hugged Smith during one stoppage in the show, and Nicole Kidman also went over to say a few words as well. 
Backstage, during interview sessions with winners, the Rock-Smith incident seemed like something few, if anyone, wanted to discuss. 
“I’m not talking about that,” said Ahmir Questlove Thompson, the director of Summer of Soul, which won an Oscar for best documentary. 
The confrontation overshadowed Smith’s milestone accomplishment. He was previously nominated twice for best actor, for his role in Ali in 2002 and The Pursuit of Happyness in 2007. In those films, he portrayed real-life characters: Boxing legend Muhammad Ali and Chris Garner, a homeless salesman. 
This time, Smith won against formidable competition including Andrew Garfield, Javier Bardem, Benedict Cumberbatch and Denzel Washington who won his first and only best actor Oscar award in 2002 over Smith for Training Day.
