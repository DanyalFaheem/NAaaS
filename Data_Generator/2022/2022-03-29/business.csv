0,"‘Faulty’ donor-driven advice piling up debt, says PIDE head","“The government is piling up debt to do work that Pakistani researchers can do better,"" he says.","BHURBAN: The government-owned Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) has criticised the government for blindly following donor-driven agenda unnecessarily burdening the country with debt without desired outcomes.
The continuously rising power sector problems including circular debt rising by Rs1 billion a day despite repeated loans and the recent housing subsidy scheme involving billions of rupees of taxpayers’ money on false estimates were quoted as glaring examples of hundreds of policy loans from international lenders.
The policy advisory loans by international creditors are pushing Pakistan further under the debt burden, which the government can avoid by relying on its researchers, says a former official of the International Monetary Fund Dr Nadeemul Haque — currently vice-chancellor of PIDE. 
He said the advice by the foreign lenders also often lacked a base, resulting in faulty decision-making. “The government is piling the debt to do work that Pakistani researchers can do better,” he said.

Researcher says Pakistan faces inadequate housing, not a shortage

The statement came days after the ADB approved a second tranche of a $300 million loan for capital market reforms. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have been pegging their loans with policy advisory to bring so-called reforms in areas of energy, revenue mobilisation, debt management, fiscal prudence and capital market reforms. But despite pumping in billions of dollars, the country’s performance in these sectors has remained dismal.
Few post-programme evaluations reports by independent wings of the WB and the ADB also admit that these loans have failed to bring reforms in the targeted areas. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government has obtained over $53bon gross foreign loans after coming into power and around three-fourths of these were either policy loans or short-term commercial loans.
Dr Haq is the second senior government official who has publicly criticised the growing dependency on foreign policy loans. Earlier, Federal Board of Revenue chairman Mohammad Ashfaq said that the FBR was better off without a $400m WB loan meant for increasing revenues. The loan had been signed by the PTI government despite public opposition to it.
The donors are dumping their research in Pakistan with money on the table that Pakistan also has to return, said Dr Haq who is also a former deputy chairman of the Planning Commission.
Despite billions of dollars that the foreign lenders pumped into the energy sector, the sector sustained Rs8 trillion losses in the past 10 years, said Dr Haq.
Without having any check and care for the output, the government has given Rs2bn to the UNDP, which is more than the money given to any university in Pakistan for conducting research, said the PIDE VC.
The circular debt of power, petroleum and LNG sectors has jumped to over Rs3.9tr, said Dr Naveed Arshad — a researcher from Lahore University of Management Sciences who has researched on reduction of the cost of electricity generation. His findings showed that the country can reduce the cost of generation by shifting demand from peak to off-peak hours. He estimated Rs6.5bn savings by shifting only 5pc peak period demand.
However, despite billions of rupees of foreign loans for the energy sector, the cost of generation and end-consumer prices have been constantly on the rise. Pakistani researchers can do much better than a white man who does not have local experience but gives advice on Pakistan through policy loans, said Dr Haq. “We still have not been able to free ourselves from the colonial clutches,” he said while inaugurating the conference.
He said the onus was is on Pakistani researchers and asked why they are being silent spectators? Why don’t they question things around us? 
He said PIDE’s RASTA was one such platform where it has provided the space for our local researchers to come up with innovative ideas and local solutions. Through RASTA, we have also proved that we can do better than those who steer local research from outside.
The government made a policy to provide 10 million homes, apparently on the advice from the WB that claimed a shortage of 10 million homes in Pakistan, said Durr-e-Nayab, Director Research and Pro-Vice-Chancellor of PIDE. 
Presenting her study titled ‘The Assumed Shortage of Housing in Pakistan’, she said the WB based its claim on SBP research and the SBP was referring to the WB in its papers. “A whole policy was made on a figure that didn’t have a verified base,” said Dr Nayab.
“We are short of 10 million housing units” has been a buzzword in politics, media, and donor-driven research for the last 10 years, she stated. Given an average household size of well over six persons, this means that nearly one-third of the population is without housing. Do we see such a huge number of people living on footpaths, on the sides of roads, under bridges, or in any open area? Thankfully, NO.
It is not clear from where did this number come from, she added. Worryingly, the government also uses this estimate without ever questioning its validity. Sadly we have based policy on this assumption and initiated a large public housing effort at considerable cost. Not to mention the negative spillover effects on the other sector in the context of tight fiscal space. So, PIDE after digging out the reality concludes that there is certainly not a “deficit of 10 million housing units” in Pakistan. There may be “inadequate housing” in the country, but not a “housing shortage”. The deficit is in the quality of life in the houses, not the absence of housing units.

3,"Risks growing for economy, cautions finance ministry",Says the scalation of geopolitical tensions and domestic political conditions could hamper the positive outlook for economy.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Monday cautioned that escalation of geopolitical tensions and domestic political conditions could hamper the positive outlook for Pakistan’s economy and may also aggravate the macroeconomic imbalances.
The recent geopolitical tensions, in particular the Ukraine crisis, is the most important external risk factor. Likewise, political conditions at home are building domestic risks, the Economic Adviser’s Wing (EAW) of the Ministry of Finance in its Monthly Economic Update & Outlook.
In its March update, the EAW noted that a further escalation of these risks could hamper the positive outlook for Pakistan’s economy and may also aggravate macroeconomic imbalances.
Currently, the global economy is facing three challenges including financial sanctions, commodity prices and supply-chain disruptions due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. These challenges have fueled global inflation and downgraded the growth outlook in most countries.
Both energy and non-energy prices increased in February 2022 by 7.7 per cent and 4.2pc, respectively. Among key sub-groups, only fertilisers witnessed a decline of 1.9pc, agriculture commodities rose 4.5pc, metals and minerals 4.7pc, and precious metals 2.2pc.
According to the report, Pakistan’s economic performance continues to be strong and is still on a trajectory compatible with an economic growth target of around 5pc in the current fiscal year.
Its cyclical position has returned to a more neutral stance. If this trend continues in the next months, economic growth will be driven primarily by the expansion of manufacturing capacity. However, the intensity of internal and external risks has still not been exactly realised which may adversely affect domestic economic activities.
Further, inflation and the current account deficit (CAD) are still under pressure. The government is taking measures to limit as much as possible further increases in the cost of living in the coming months. Moreover, the government measures designed to stimulate exports and discourage unnecessary imports are expected to contribute to constrain CAD.

5,"Steel hits all-time high at Rs216,000 per tonne",One company has attributed the hike to a continuous and unprecedented bullish trend in the cost of scrap over the past month.,"KARACHI: The second increase in the ongoing month pushed the steel bar price to an all-time high of Rs216,000 per tonne thus affecting the construction activities across the country mainly due to the rising cost of all other building materials.
The manufacturers had raised prices by up to Rs8,000 in the second week of the current month.
Amreli Steel Ltd (ASL) has increased the price to Rs216,000 for 9.5/10mm and 12mm sizes while the price of 16mm and above (deform and extreme bars) is fixed at Rs214,000.
The company attributed the price hike to a continuous and unprecedented bullish trend in the cost of scrap over the past month, the falling rupee and the rising cost of energy. 
The new price of Agha Steel Electric Arc Furnace rebar has been increased by Rs7,000 per tonne. The rates of 16mm and above and 9.5mm-12.7mm are Rs214,000 and Rs216,000 as compared to Rs207,000 and Rs209,000 per tonne respectively.
Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD) chairman Mohsin Sheikhani said the cost of construction has risen by over 70pc in the last year owing to soaring steel bar, cement, labour cost, paint, sanitary fittings, tiles, windows and door fittings, etc. He said the price of sanitary, tiles, doors and window fittings has swelled by 30-35pc in the last year.
The government has stopped holding weekly meetings with construction stakeholders, builders and relevant government ministries for the last three to four weeks owing to rising political temperature and uncertain economic conditions, he said.
He said builders had asked the government to reduce the customs duty on the finished steel products and raw materials used in the making of steel bars to bring down steel prices. 
Mr Sheikhani said builders of low-cost projects are highly worried as they had started their construction work at Rs2,500 per sq ft rate a year back which had now risen to over Rs4,000 per sq ft.
Karachi Iron and Steel Merchants Association (KISMA) President Shamoon Baqarali said the demand for steel products has slowed down due to political unrest.
As per the Sensitive Price Index data for the week ending March 24, the cement price had gone up by 41pc compared to the same week last year. 
The average price is now Rs862 per 50 kg bag versus Rs610.
