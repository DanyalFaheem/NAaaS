0,Lahore's Shahkam Chowk flyover opens to traffic,Finishing work to be completed within a month.,"LAHORE: The newly-constructed Shahkam Chowk flyover has been opened to traffic, easing mobility of the public at large at Link Canal Road, Shahkam intersection and New Defence Road.
Since the flyover was operationalised after some necessary works were completed on a fast track in a bid to allow motorists to use the facility during Eid, the finishing work would be completed within the next 30 days, Dawn has learnt.
“The flyover has almost been completed. And now both sides of the flyover have been opened to traffic which will not only ease public mobility but also help us in eliminating environmental issues caused by the constant traffic jams, carbon emissions etc,” LDA Chief Engineer (II) Mazhar Hussain Khan told this reporter when contacted.
“For completion of the finishing works, the flyover will not be closed as the remaining work would be done side by side with continuation of traffic,” he added.

Finishing work to be completed within a month

It may be mentioned that work on the Rs4.233 billion Shahkam Chowk flyover project had been launched on-time in July last year. However, the land acquisition (64 kanal) was delayed for some time due to procedural issues. The possession of the entire land was given to the contractor in November last year. The project total outlay included Rs2.5487bn construction cost. For completion of the project, the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco), on the request of LDA, had also observed power shutdown after Eidul Fitr in a bid to make the extra high voltage transmission lines (66kV, 132kV and 220kV) dead, enabling the construction workers and engineers of the contractor to easily lay girders, deck slabs through cranes under supervision of the project owner - Lahore Development Authority - without any fear of electrocution and other incidents.
Earlier, the Lesco had refused to observe shutdown during Ramazan with a view to supplying electricity to consumers uninterruptedly. However, after observance of the shutdown schedule, the engineers, workers and allied staff completed the works related to laying of girders, deck slabs and other material through heavy machinery.
“I can say that the substantial completion of the project has been done. The finishing works such as lane marking, beautification etc., the at-grade (on-ground) works at New Defence Road, which links Kahna/Ferozepur Road with Multan Road at Mohlanwal and other right/left housing schemes, villages and small localities will take a few weeks more,” the chief engineer explained.
“But we have opened the road leading to Mohlanwal. However, the New Defence Road (Hudiara drain side/Kahna) will also be opened soon after completion of some ongoing work if Lesco shifts as many as 50 poles to other place on time,” he said.
To a question, he said the Rs4.3 billion Saggian Road Rehabilitation Project would also be completed soon as the work is under way these days In May, the newly-constructed Sheranwala Gate flyover had also been opened to traffic, easing mobility of the people crossing the area to reach Ravi Road. However, some at-grade works including the allied ones - construction of a road with protected U-turns, slip roads, concrete pavement, shifting of utility services etc., were completed later. The construction work on the Rs5bn Sheranwala gate project had been launched in June last year and was set to be completed on March 18. However, various issues such as delay in land acquisition at tyre market and other areas affected the pace of work on the project. The Rs5bn project cost included Rs2.634bn for construction and the rest for the land acquisition. The beneficiary areas of the project include Lahore’s northern parts (railway station, Walled City, Akbari Mandi, Azam Cloth Market, Lunda Bazaar, Badami Bagh, Shadbagh, Misri Shah, GT Road, Shah Alam Market, Data Darbar area, Brandreth Road and Azadi Chowk).
“At present, this project is complete and there is no pending work,” the LDA chief engineer said.

1,Religious groups lend support to PTI candidates,"LAHORE: Different religious groups including Tehreek Dawatul Haq, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad, Muttahida Jamiat Ahle...","LAHORE: Different religious groups including Tehreek Dawatul Haq, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad, Muttahida Jamiat Ahle Hadis and Ittehad Ulema Council on Saturday announced their support to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf candidates contesting by-elections in 14 districts in the province.
Speaking at a news conference at Jamia Taleemul Quran, the religious groups leaders including Pir Hanif, Syed Waliullah Shah Bukhari, Hafiz Nauman Hamid flanked by PTI leaders said the PML-N coalition government was [allegedly] harassing people just to protect its corruption.
PTI central Punjab president Dr Yasmin Rashid and general secretary Hammad Azhar said the by-election on 20 seats had assumed a great importance as its results would decide whether the PML-N government could be toppled or not.
Dr Rashid said every segment of the society was amassing support for Imran Khan since he was the only leader who would steer the country out of the crisis. She said the successive governments had taken the country to slavery and this election would help the country to take the path of progress.
Mr Azhar expressed gratitude to the religious groups for extending support to the PTI for by-elections and asserted that the PTI candidates would now win the elections and topple the PML-N government.
He said the nation must go for general elections because the country was heading towards economic disaster. “Some 70 per cent of people as per fresh surveys want to go to the fresh general elections,” he added.
Senator Ijaz Chaudhry said the religious organisations had supported Imran Khan because he was the only leader who announced and tried to establish Riasat-e-Madina in the country.

2,Fayyaz Chohan alleges threats by Maryam’s media cell,Claims has been asked to leave PTI within two days.,"LAHORE: PTI chairman Imran Khan’s media adviser Fayyazul Hassan Chohan has alleged that he was threatened by PML-N vice chairperson Maryam Nawaz’s media cell and asked to “leave the party within two days”. 
Sharing the screenshot of the calls allegedly made on his mobile phone with the media, Mr Chohan said Maryam Nawaz’ strategic media cell was operating to “widen the gulf between the public and state institutions”. 
He said the callers, who used a “no caller ID” line, asked him to leave the PTI within two days or face serious consequences.  
Mr Chohan said the “no caller ID” line was used to create an impression that the calls were being made by persons belonging to some state institution.  
He said such tactics being allegedly used by the PML-N and Maryam Nawaz could not demoralise the PTI leaders and workers. 
Mr Chohan demanded that the state institutions and intelligence agencies should take notice of these activities of Maryam Nawaz’ strategic media cell.

3,Four-day long power outage: Protesters block motorway for hours,LAHORE: Thousands of people travelling to their native areas suffered inconvenience on Friday night after protesters...,"LAHORE: Thousands of people travelling to their native areas suffered inconvenience on Friday night after protesters blocked the M-5 Motorway near Shah Rukn-i-Alam interchange against the Multan Electric Supply Company’s (Mepco) failure to restore electricity supply to nearby villages for the last four days.
Hundreds of residents of the villages deprived of electricity approached the M-5 Motorway near Shah Rukn-i-Alam interchange late on Friday night and blocked both sides of the road for traffic.  
The protest continued till 10am on Saturday. 
The protesters were chanting slogans against Mepco for failing to restore electricity in their localities for the last several days. 
The motorway blockage caused inconvenience to the passengers travelling by buses and cars from Lahore to Sukkur, besides truckers carrying sacrificial animals. The traffic remained trapped for several hours. 
According to Mepco sources, the electricity supply to several villages was disrupted due to uprooting of poles supporting the high-voltage wires and conductors during a heavy thunderstorm and rain hitting the area four days ago. 
The protesters said despite repeated complaints, the Mepco administration turned a deaf ear to their grievance and took no action to restore the power supply. 
During the protest, the motorway officials concerned kept diverting the traffic to alternate routes to save the passengers from inconvenience. 
On being informed of the protest, Motorway SP Javed Iqbal Chadhur, DSP Hassan Bhatti, Mepco and district administration officials held dialogues with the protesters and convinced them to clear the road for traffic. 
The Mepco Chief Engineer Maher Allah Yar Bharwana held an emergency meeting with his subordinates and directed them to immediately resolve the issue. 
Later, the power supply was restores to the affected villages on Saturday.

The  chief  minister assigned the tasks to Solid Waste Management Companies  and to  the administration of every district to ensure zero waste and  warned of  action in case of any lapse.
He directed deputy  commissioners and  officers of SWMCs to review cleanliness plan by  making field visits and  announced that he would personally supervise  all the arrangements being  made.
Hamza Shehbaz also ordered  facilities for visitors at  tourist spots, specially Murree and asked  official concerned to maintain  the flow of traffic in all the tourist  places.
LWMC: The Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) claims to have prepared a fool-proof plan to lift and dump the sacrificial animals’ offal and other solid waste during the three days of Eid.  

LWMC cleanliness plan ‘ready’ for Eid days

According to LWMC, it has set up 13 camps in the cattle markets and sacrificial animals’ sale points, 280 camps in as many union councils and 18 model camps at various places in the city to distribute environment-friendly waste bags among the people, besides lodging waste-related complaints.

5,PTI ‘justifies’ jeer Ahsan faced at Bhera stopover,Minister terms episode result of hate-mongering fanned by Imran...,"LAHORE: As PML-N federal minister Ahsan Iqbal has called himself a ‘victim of hate’ the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) says the people are showing their anger for the ‘imported regime’ for stealing their mandate.
“I am a victim of hate. I had earlier been shot at by a man who was poisoned by hate and now this heckling incident was originated by the politics of hate introduced by PTI chairman Imran Khan,” Mr Iqbal who has a portfolio of planning and development told a presser here on Saturday.
Ahsan Iqbal was jeered at and heckled by the PTI supporters at a restaurant in Bhera (Lahore-Islamabad motorway) on Friday night. Viral videos of the incident circulating on social media show women and teenagers chanting anti-government slogans against the incumbent nine-party coalition government led by the PML-N calling Iqbal ‘chor’ (thief). The minister put up a smile and did not offer any reaction.
In the presser, Mr Iqbal declared he did not intend to seek criminal charges against the PTI supporters who heckled him, saying he had left the matter in the ‘people’s court.’

Minister terms episode result of hate-mongering fanned by Imran

Critical of ousted premier Imran Khan’s ‘politics of hatred’, the minister said the incident put the culture of hate into the spotlight Imran Khan had introduced. “The disease of polarisation and hatred is detrimental to our society and the country. Imran Niazi, who was a sportsman, is expected to teach his supporters sportsmanship in the country’s politics but unfortunately he is doing the opposite. The hate Khan spewed is spreading fast and if we don’t counter it, the society will be just steps away from anarchy and civil war like that of Libya,” he cautioned.
Iqbal, who was shot at and injured in an assassination attempt by a man who had affiliation with the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) months before 2018 elections, also asked the PTI supporters and sympathisers to give a serious thinking whether they wanted their children to become victims of this hate.
Senior PTI leaders did not condemn the incident, rather they said the PML-N and allied parties should be aware of the ground realities.
“People are against you (PML-N) because you have come to power by stealing their political mandate,” former information minister of PTI Fawad Chaudhry said in a tweet and demanded fresh elections. Chaudhry also advised the PML-N leaders to ‘wear burqa (veil)’ while going out in public to save them from their reaction.
Another former PTI minister Shireen Mazari said those heckled Iqbal were ordinary citizens. “Why assume its PTI followers? Ordinary citizens are fed up & angry. As for the political atmosphere being vitiated, the Imported Govt & handlers have already done the needful,” she said in a tweet.
PTI’s Hammad Azhar tweeted: “As per PML-N and its dependents, its okay to throw tear gas at peaceful citizens including women and children, order police to barge into residences without warrants, book people on fake FIRs. But raising slogans in McDonald’s against an unpopular fascist govt is high treason.”
On Saturday, Iqbal’s incident was one of the top trends on social media with thousands of tweets in his support and against his party.

7,Water availability more urgent than other inputs,LAHORE: Availability of water at the right time and in the right quantity is the more crucial issue for Pakistan’s...,"LAHORE: Availability of water at the right time and in the right quantity is the more crucial issue for Pakistan’s agriculture than shortage or high prices of fertilisers or other farm inputs, says Punjab Director-General Agriculture (Extension) Dr Anjum Ali Buttar. 
Speaking to Dawn on the issues currently being faced by the agriculture sector, he expressed his concern at the increasing shortage of the most important farm input – water – as a result of climate change. He says either there are no timely rains, particularly in the rivers’ catchment areas, or there is downpour but the whole water goes wasted for a lack of storage capacity.  
“Countries with water storage capacity of less than 30 days face the same kind of challenges in agriculture as we are facing now.” He says Punjab is still facing 50pc shortage in river waters and this issue, coupled with unusual heatwave, is stressing Kharif crops. 
He calls for reviving the Punjab tradition of developing ponds at village level as a short-term measure to overcome the water shortage at crucial stages of crops. By harvesting rainwater and the canal water supplies, when it is not needed during monsoon, in the ponds, the farmers may meet their emergency water requirements from these small storages, he adds.  
Bigger reservoirs may be, and should be, developed at a later stage, he says. He says the department is also working on introducing farm methods that could reduce consumption of water by crops such as rice. “We are carrying out experiments such as direct seeding at our research facilities and their success will help overcome the need for abundant water to sow rice and other crops.”  
The DG says the country is producing 6.2 million tonnes of urea which is enough for domestic needs but the smuggling of the compost due to a huge difference between the local and international prices is leading to the twin menaces of hoarding and smuggling of urea.  
His department, he says, is conducting raids against the unscrupulous elements involved in hoarding urea and other fertilisers or overcharging the farmers. Since May 9, 2002, a fine of Rs20.377m has been imposed on hoarders and those found involved in overcharging in fertilisers with 258 FIRs launched and 67 arrests made, he claims. He says the government is also importing three million tonnes of urea to meet the increasing local demand. He says application of urea during monsoon is ‘overuse’ of the input because rainwater serves the same purpose as what is obtained from the compost – growth of leaves.  
Dr Buttar says they need to promote the usage of phosphoric fertilisers as it is lower than international standards but these fertilisers develop grain in the crops and thus help improve per acre yield.

Through his counsel, Mr Zahoor says the daughters custody  matter has already been settled by the Supreme Court. He says no  threats have been extended to Sofia. Rather, she has been requested to  share any admissible evidence in this regard, failing which the law  shall take its course against her.  
He says during the pendency  of proceedings before the Supreme Court, several attempts were made to extradite him from the UAE, however, the request of extradition by the Pakistan government was turned down every time by the UAE government due to lack of any incriminating material. 
Currently, he said, the matter of bail of one Sadaf Naz is pending before the court without him (Zahoor) being any party to the proceedings.  
Most importantly, he says, a court in the UAE has granted him the custody of daughters.  
“Despite being given a colossal sum of money and full support  by me and the foreign office of Pakistan upon the orders of the Supreme Court in order to assist her to present her case in  the UAE, Sofia failed to pursue the case of custody of daughters.” 
Mr Zahoor says his daughters have also made it publicly clear that they are “happily living with their father”.

The  PML-N has fielded Syeda Zehra Basit Bukhari, wife of MNA Syed Basit  Sultan Bukhari, and PTI reposes trust in Sardar Moazzam Khan Jatoi in  PP-272. Interestingly, Bukhari’s brother-in-law Syed Haroon Sultan  Bukhari is in the run as an independent candidate. MNA Bukhari is  holding corner meetings for his wife.  
A tough contest is  expected among the contenders. Former MPA Sardar Chunnu Khan Leghari has  withdrawn his candidature in favour of Moazzam Khan Jatoi. Another  independent candidate, Dr Zareena Kausar, is contesting the election for  the first time and she is trying to convince the constituents to vote  for her. The Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan has fielded Muhammad Ibrahim who  is also actively canvassing.  
At a press conference, Jatoi  alleged that MNA Bukhari had used his influence to have water theft  cases registered against his supporters. He urged the judiciary to take  notice of the intimidatory tactics.  
Meanwhile, the supporters of  Bukhari family seem to be divided and Jatoi may be able to cash in on  the situation. Chunnu Khan Leghari said PTI chairman Imran Khan  requested him during a meeting at his Bani Gala residence to support  Jatoi. Some people respect MNA Bukhari for being a man of commitment who  works to ensure development projects for the people. He claimed that he  left the PTI only because it ignored the schemes he proposed.
Bukhari  won the NA seat in the 2018 general election as an independent  candidate while Haroon Bukhari contested election on the PML-N ticket.  
Dr  Zareena Kausar is also expected to make her presence felt as she is the  first woman in Jatoi tehsil to have ventured into politics and is the  wife of an additional district and sessions judge.  
In PP-273,  Syed Sibtain Bukhari of the PML-N is considered a strong candidate  having support of the Gopang and Syed families. Sardar Amir Talal  Gopang, an MNA, is burning the midnight oil to ensure his success. PTI  candidate Yasir Jatoi, who enjoys the support of Sardar Qayyum Khan  Jatoi and Syed Qaim Ali Shamsi, is likely to give a tough time to  Bukhari. 
Moazzam Khan Jatoi told Dawn that Imran Khan would reach out to the public on July 11.
