Western diplomats have long expressed concern about devices this cascade, or cluster, of centrifuges is equipped with.
The use of these so-called modified sub-headers means Iran could switch more quickly and easily to enriching to higher purity levels.
While Iran is required to inform the International Atomic Energy Agency about such a switch, if it chose not to, it might escape detection for some time as there is currently a lag between Iran’s enrichment and IAEA inspectors’ verification of what is produced.
“On 7 July 2022, Iran informed the Agency that, on the same day, it had begun feeding the aforementioned cascade with UF6 enriched up to 5pc U-235,” the confidential report to IAEA member states said.
UF6 refers to uranium hexafluoride gas which is fed into centrifuges to be enriched.
In a report on June 20, the IAEA said that months after Iran informed it of its intention to use the cascade, Iran had begun feeding UF6 into it for passivation, a process that comes before enrichment.
The IAEA verified on July 6 that passivation had ended, Saturday’s report said.
“On 9 July 2022, the Agency verified that Iran had begun feeding UF6 enriched up to 5pc U-235 into the cascade of 166 IR-6 centrifuges with modified sub-headers for the declared purpose of producing UF6 enriched up to 20pc U-235,” it said.
Iran is already enriching to up to 60pc elsewhere, well above the up to 20pc it produced before its 2015 deal with major powers that capped its enrichment level at 3.67pc but still below the roughly 90pc of weapons grade.
The move is the latest step of many to breach and move well beyond the restrictions which the 2015 deal imposed on Iran’s nuclear activities. It comes as talks to revive that deal are at an impasse and Western powers have warned time is running out to reach an agreement.
The United States pulled out of the deal in 2018 under then-president Donald Trump, re-imposing sanctions against Tehran that the deal had lifted. A year later, Iran began retaliating by breaching the deal’s restrictions.

1,Rival Libyan PM says to enter capital ‘in coming days’,"TUNIS: Libya’s Fathi Bashagha, appointed as prime minister in a challenge to a unity government in Tripoli, plans...","TUNIS: Libya’s Fathi Bashagha, appointed as prime minister in a challenge to a unity government in Tripoli, plans to take office in the capital  “in the coming days”, he said.
Libya’s parliament picked the former interior minister in February to lead a government to replace that of interim premier Abdulhamid Dbeibah, appointed last year as part of a United Nations-backed peace process to end more than a decade of violence in the North African country.
But Dbeibah has refused to hand over power before elections, setting up a showdown with Bashagha, named by the eastern-based legislature elected in 2014 and backed by military strongman Khalifa Haftar. In May, Bashagha arrived in the capital Tripoli in the country’s west and attempted to take office there, sparking pre-dawn clashes between armed groups supporting him and those backing Dbeibah.
He backed down to avoid bloodshed, but says he has since received  “positive invitations” to enter the capital.
“All the roads are open into Tripoli and God willing we’ll be there in the coming days,” he said in an interview, speaking via Zoom from his temporary base in the central city of Sirte.
“Some armed forces have changed their position and have nothing against us entering the capital.” Both Bashagha and Dbeibah come from the western city of Misrata and are backed by different forces in Tripoli.
Their rivalry is the latest configuration of the complex power struggles that have riven the country since the 2011 Nato-backed revolt that toppled and killed dictator Moamer Qadhafi.
Dbeibah came to power following a landmark 2020 ceasefire that ended a year-long battle as Haftar tried, unsuccessfully, to seize the capital by force.
The transitional government had a mandate to lead the country to elections last December, but they never took place due to divisions over the rules and the presence of controversial candidates. Bashagha argues that today, Dbeibah’s government is  “illegitimate”.

2,Police admit security flaws as body of Shinzo Abe arrives home,"“It is undeniable that there were problems with the guarding and safety measures for former prime minister Abe,” says official.","TOKYO: Japanese police on Saturday admitted there were  “problems” with security for former prime minister Shinzo Abe, as his body arrived at his family home a day after he was assassinated on the campaign trail.
The country was in mourning for Japan’s longest-serving premier and well-wishers gathered to pay their respects, with senior politicians dressed in black arriving at Abe’s Tokyo residence to offer condolences.
But candidates also continued campaigning for the upper house election on Sunday, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida insisting:  “We must never allow violence to suppress speech during elections, which are the foundation of democracy.” The murder of Japan’s best-known politician has rattled the country and sent shockwaves around the world, particularly given the nation’s low levels of violent crime and strict gun laws.
Police are still piecing together details of the man who opened fire at close range on Friday, but the 41-year-old named as Tetsuya Yamaguchi has confessed to killing the former premier, motivated by a belief Abe was linked to an unspecified organisation.
The tearful head of police in the Nara region where Abe was killed admitted on Saturday there were  “undeniable” flaws in security for the former leader.
“I believe it is undeniable that there were problems with the guarding and safety measures for former prime minister Abe,” said Tomoaki Onizuka, head of the Nara prefectural police, pledging a  “thorough investigation.”  “In all the years since I became a police officer in 1995... there is no greater remorse, no bigger regret than this,” he said. Early on Saturday afternoon, Abe’s body arrived at his home, where mourners like Tetsuya Hamada gathered to offer prayers and flowers.
“I am stunned that things like this still take place in Japan,” he said.
“It makes me sad. How it is possible that this happened in broad daylight?” Japan’s upper house election will go ahead as planned on Sunday, and Kishida calling on supporters to  “help us until the very end.” But Abe’s death cast a long shadow, and at the scene of his murder, 52-year-old Kayoko Ueda was wiping away tears and described herself as  “distraught”. “I couldn’t believe something like this could actually happen in Japan,” she said.
Yamagami’s motives remain unclear, with police declining so far to identify the organisation he believed Abe had links to.
They are investigating claims Yamagami served in Japan’s navy, and said he appeared to have used a handmade gun.
National broadcaster NHK said he described months of planning for the attack, including an original plot involving explosives that was later shelved in favour of building guns. Citing police sources, the station said Yamagami also claimed to have scouted out Abe at other speeches.
Security at local campaign events in Japan can be relatively relaxed, but given Abe’s profile, questions have been raised about whether measures to protect him were too lax.
Dramatic footage of the attack showed Yamaguchi, dressed in a grey shirt and brown trousers, was able to approach Abe from behind without being intercepted, and draw a weapon from a bag. He appeared to fire two shots, each producing a cloud of smoke.

3,India fines Amnesty nearly $8m after funding probe,NEW DELHI: India has fined the local arm of Amnesty International nearly $8 million after a probe into its finances...,"NEW DELHI: India has fined the local arm of Amnesty International nearly $8 million after a probe into its finances the watchdog said was part of a  “witch hunt”.
Rights groups have long claimed they face harassment from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist administration for highlighting rights abuses, including in held Kashmir.
Amnesty’s local bank accounts were frozen in 2020 as part of the probe, forcing the group to lay off staff and halt campaign and research work.
India’s Enforcement Directorate, the agency responsible for investigating financial crimes, said that Amnesty had broken foreign funding laws by directing overseas contributions to expand its local operations.
In a statement, it said Amnesty India had been fined $6.5 million for receiving illegal foreign contributions, while its former chief executive Aakar Patel was fined an additional $1.3 million.
Amnesty did not immediately respond to the latest action by the agency. But in 2020, the group said the freezing of its accounts was part of an  “incessant witch-hunt of human rights organisations by the Government of India over unfounded and motivated allegations.” 
Like in Russia under President Vladimir Putin and Viktor Orban’s Hungary, critics say Modi’s government has sought to pressure rights groups by heavily scrutinising their finances and clamping down on foreign funding.
In 2015, the year after Modi took office, the Indian government froze the bank accounts of environmental organisation Greenpeace’s India unit.

4,"MPs jockey for UK leadership race, defence secretary won’t stand",Four contenders have so far declared they are standing.,"LONDON: Britain’s defence secretary, one of the favourites in polls to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson, announced on Saturday that he would not throw his hat into the already acrimonious leadership race.
The likely months-long campaign, potentially pitting more than a dozen Tory lawmakers and multiple factions of the ruling party against each another, is set to be formalised on Monday when a committee of backbenchers will meet to agree the timetable and rules.
Four contenders have so far declared they are standing. The early frontrunner is former finance minister Rishi Sunak, who helped kickstart the cabinet revolt that led to Johnson’s forced resignation on Thursday.
Sunak resigned late on Tuesday, triggering dozens of more junior colleagues to follow suit and forcing his ex-boss to then quit as Tory leader 36 hours later.
But Johnson, whose three-year premiership has been defined by scandal, the country’s departure from the European Union and Covid, said he would stay on until his successor is selected.
A summer of rancorous campaigning now looms. Party members will eventually choose their new leader — from a two-person shortlist whittled down in multiple rounds of MPs’ voting — before the Conservatives’ annual conference in early October.
Taxation is set to be a key feature of the race, alongside candidates’ Brexit credentials, as Britain faces the toxic combination of high inflation and rampant cost-of-living increases alongside stagnant growth and relatively high tax rates.
Alongside Sunak, attorney general and arch-Brexiteer Suella Braverman, the relatively unknown former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch and backbench Tory MP Tom Tugendhat have announced their candidacies.
Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and new finance minister Nadhim Zahawi — who replaced Sunak in the treasury on Wednesday — are expected to join the crowded field which could feature as many as 15 contenders.
Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, who was runner-up to Boris Johnson in 2019, is also  “virtually certain” to run again, allies told UK media.
However, Wallace who has impressed as defence chief and been among the frontrunners in several recent polls, said he would not stand after discussing a bid with colleagues and family.
“It has not been an easy choice to make, but my focus is on my current job and keeping this great country safe,” he added on Twitter.
Sunak, narrowly ahead of Truss atop the latest poll of party members, drew immediate support from several senior MPs after declaring he was standing in a slick video on social media late on Friday. He was also swiftly attacked by Johnson loyalists in a sign of the acrimony that could blight the contest.

5,Four injured in Shanghai hospital stabbing,Police say attacker shot and injured.,"SHANGHAI: Four people were wounded in a stabbing at a major Shanghai hospital on Saturday morning, local police said, before the knife-wielding attacker was shot and subdued by officers.
Huangpu district police said on social media that they received emergency reports at 11:30am on Saturday of a stabbing at downtown Ruijin hospital.
“The police quickly arri­ved on the scene and discovered a man holding a group of people hostage with a knife on the hospital’s seventh floor,” the statement said.
“When the suspect intended to injure the hostages and punish the police, the police decisively fired a shot to injure and subdue him.” Four members of the public were being treated for wounds and are  “not in a life-threatening condition”, the statement added. At present, the attacker’s motive remains unclear.
Chinese media published videos showing armed police officers attempting to break into a locked room in the hospital. Another heavily circulated social media video showed over a dozen distressed members of the public running out of the building.
Mass violent crime is rare in China, which strictly prohibits citizens from owning firearms, but knife attacks do happen occasionally.
Last month, a 23-year-old man in the eastern city of Ningbo died after being violently stabbed on the street in broad daylight.
Video of the attack near a bus stop went viral on social media.
In recent years, a string of fatal knife attacks targeting kindergarten and school students have occurred nationwide, carried out by people reportedly wishing to wreak revenge on society.

6,Russia threatens broad Ukraine offensive as US presses China over war stance,"Ukrainian defenders battle to contain Russian forces along several fronts, say officials.","KYIV: Ukrainian defenders battled on Saturday to contain Russian forces along several fronts, officials said, as the United States pressed China to align itself with the West in opposing the invasion following an ill-tempered G20 meeting.
A missile strike on the northeastern city of Kharkiv wounded three civilians, its governor said, though Russia’s main attacks appeared focused southeast of there in Luhansk and Donetsk.
The two provinces, swathes of which were already held by pro-Russian separatists before Russia’s invasion in February, comprise the eastern industrial region of the Donbas.
Ukrainian officials reported strikes in both on Saturday, while Britain’s Ministry of Defence said in a regular bulletin that Moscow was assembling reserve forces from across Russia near Ukraine.
Donetsk regional Governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on the Telegram messaging service that a Russian missile had struck Druzhkivka, a town behind the front line, and reported shelling of other population centres.
Luhansk Governor Serhiy Gaidai said on Telegram that Russian forces were  “firing along the entire front line”, but later said a Ukrainian counter-attack had hit Russian weapons and ammunition stores and forced Moscow to halt its offensive. Russia, which claimed control over all of Luhansk province last weekend, denies targeting civilians.
On Friday, Ukraine had pleaded for more of the high-end weapons from the West that Kyiv said had thus far enabled it so slow Russia’s advance.
Hours later, US President Joe Biden signed a new weapons package for Ukraine worth up to $400 million, including four additional high mobility artillery rocket systems (HIMARS).
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked Biden for armaments he said were priority needs.  “It is what helps us press on the enemy,” he said on Twitter.
Commenting on the supply of weapons, the Russian embassy in Washington said the United States wanted to  “prolong the conflict at all costs” and compensate for Ukrainian military losses.
On Saturday US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, urging the international community to condemn Russian aggression, said he had raised concerns with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi over Beijing’s alignment with Moscow, during talks that lasted over five hours.
Blinken spoke to journalists from the Indonesian island of Bali after a gathering on Friday of G20 foreign ministers. Russia’s Sergei Lavrov had walked out of a meeting there, denouncing the West for its  “frenzied criticism”. Shortly before the Feb. 24 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Beijing and Moscow announced a  “no limits” partnership, although U.S. officials have said they have not seen China evade tough US-led sanctions on Russia or provide it with military equipment.
Oleh Synehubov, the governor of Kharkiv, said on Telegram that, as well as the missile strike on the city, fighters had repulsed two Russian attacks near Dementiivka, a town situated between the city and the border with Russia.
Russia’s defence ministry said its forces hit two  “bases of foreign mercenaries deployed near Kharkiv”.
Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov also said two Ukrainian Su-25 aircraft had been shot down in the southern Mykolaiv region, and that it had destroyed five ammunition depots there and in the eastern regions of Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk.

7,Syrian President Bashar al-Assad attends Eid prayers in former rebel bastion,Wishes the people of Syria and soldiers in the military a happy Eid.,"DAMASCUS: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on Saturday took part in Eidul Azha prayers on the second day of his first visit to ex-rebel-stronghold Aleppo in over a decade, state media reported.
Assad began the highly symbolic visit on Friday to Syria’s second city, formerly held by rebels and jihadists before it was recaptured in 2016 with crucial Russian backing, marking a major turning point in the country’s 11-year war.
“President Bashar al-Assad on Saturday performed Eid prayer at Sahabiy Abdallah bin Abbas mosque in Aleppo city,” state news agency SANA reported.
The news agency also released a message in which Assad wished the people of Syria and soldiers in the military a happy Eid.
Much of Aleppo was disfigured by the conflict, including its historic Old City, where Assad and his family were pictured walking near the Grand Umayyad mosque on Friday. SANA on Saturday published images of Assad surrounded by a crowd of clerics and worshippers clamouring to greet him.
Before the war, the northern city — considered to be one of the world’s longest continuously inhabited — boasted markets, mosques and public baths, but a brutal siege on rebels left it disfigured. Fighting damaged as much as 60 percent of Aleppo’s Old City, according to estimates by the UN’s cultural agency, Unesco.On Friday, Assad visited a major power plant in the province’s eastern countryside to supervise its partial relaunch after war damage. He was also present for the relaunching of a water pumping station, statements from the Syrian presidency said on Telegram.
Electricity networks and other infrastructure across the country were ravaged by the war, which is estimated to have killed nearly half a million people and displaced millions.

Around 10,000 people were camped near the remote Amarnath temple, nestled in a Himalayan mountain cave, when a sudden cloudburst triggered a deluge.
Frequent whirring helicopter sorties were evacuating the dead and an unknown number of panicked and injured pilgrims from the Baltal base camp to the north of the shrine.
“We found 16 bodies so far and at least 40 are missing,” an official from the state disaster response agency said.
“Security forces and all the rescue teams are looking for the missing and injured,” the official said.
The Indian army said it had deployed two infantry battalions and special forces units to help with the search alongside search and rescue dog squads.
They have so far taken 63 people with injuries away for treatment, including to a field hospital set up by the army in mountains near the shrine.
Rescuers were using handheld thermal imaging devices to look for victims who might be trapped under the mud, the army statement said.
Vivek, a pilgrim who escaped the destructive downpour, said that some of his family and members of the group he travelled to the site with were still missing.
“We were a group of 150 and 30 of us are still stuck up there. Their phones are switched off.” The annual pilgrimage sees hundreds of thousands of people trek up for days through rugged mountain passes to reach the shrine.The pilgrimage is being held for the first time since 2019 after a two-year halt brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. In normal times it is one of the biggest religious events in held Kashmir.
This year the pilgrimage is being staged alongside a huge security deployment involving tens of thousands of soldiers and police.
But treacherous weather in the mountains has in the past posed a bigger threat than security issues in the restive territory. Nearly 250 people died in 1996 when they were suddenly caught up in snowstorms that hit the area.

9,Date-rape drugs wreck German chancellor’s summer bash,"At least nine women were given a date-rape drug at an invite-only event attended by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, says his party.","BERLIN: At least nine women were given a date-rape drug at an invite-only event attended by Chancellor Olaf Scholz and MPs, his Social Democratic Party (SPD) said on Saturday.
“There’s quite a lot of emotion,” a spokesperson for the SPD’s parliamentary group said, confirming a report in the Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel.
Berlin police said officers were investigating allegations of serious bodily injuries after a 21-year-old woman filed a complaint following  “a political party’s summer party”.
“I advise all those concerned to file a complaint,” SPD’s Katja Mast said on Twitter.
The spokesperson did not rule out further cases adding to the nine already declared, according to the party.
The SPD sent out an email to all those invited to the event on Wednesday night condemning a  “monstrous act which we immediately declared to parliamentary police”. About 1,000 people joined the chancellor and MPs at the SPD’s traditional summer bash ahead of the parliamentary recess.
“It was an internal event. You could only get in with an invitation,” said the spokesperson. “There’s still a lot of uncertainty, the police are investigating.” 
In a statement, Berlin police said the woman who filed the complaint had no memory of the party the next day, prompting her to get a medical exam and file a complaint.
The woman told police she felt nauseous and dizzy during the event after consuming food and non-alcoholic beverages. The police said they had been so far informed of four other cases.

10,Madressahs revive ‘Golden Age’ in Morocco’s Fez,"FEZ: In the narrow streets of Fez’s Old City, Morocco’s first capital, centuries-old places of learning are ...","FEZ: In the narrow streets of Fez’s Old City, Morocco’s first capital, centuries-old places of learning are being revived to promote moderation in Islam, as their founders originally intended.
Studying at the 14th century Bou Inania madrassa (religious school), inside the Unesco-listed walled city, offers a life  “in the embrace of a venerable academic history”, according to student Moaz Soueif.
The Bou Inania madrassa is one of six such institutions to be renovated since 2017, under a programme funded by Morocco’s government to preserve the city’s heritage and promote tourism.
Soueif, 25, shares the madrassa’s upper floor with around 40 students of the Qarawiyyin University, which was a world-leading spiritual and educational hub centuries before the European renaissance.
Adorned throughout with intricate inscriptions and mosaics, students are not Bou Inania’s only visitors. Tourists also flock to see the elegant open-air courtyard, graced by a central fountain and walls of carefully maintained tilework.
The madrassa sits just inside Bab Boujelloud, one of the Old City’s main entrances and a key landmark for tourists. The nearby Cherratine and Attarine madrassas were also recently renovated for the benefit of tourists, who  “usually say their time here feels spiritual and the Old City is really genuine”, according to guide Sabah Alawi.
Today, Fez serves as a monument to a highpoint of Islamic civilisation, the 13th and 14th centuries when Muslim rulers governed from Morocco to western China.
That period also represents a golden age in the city’s history, which had just been reinstated as Morocco’s capital after three centuries of being overshadowed by Marrakesh further south.
Down a steep alley from Bou Inania lined with stalls selling traditional wares and local food, stands the Qarawiyyin mosque, built when the city was founded in the ninth century. It later became the heart of the university of the same name — one of the oldest in the world.
Fez University history professor El-Haj Moussa Aouni said the city thrived in the 13th-14th centuries along with other centres across the Maghreb region — from Marrakech to Oran in Algeria and Kairouan in Tunisia. The madrassas of Fez are  “add-ons to the main university, which were used for teaching sciences such as maths, medicine, mechanics and music, as well as Islamic studies and literature”, he said.
The Qarawiyyin mosque has a large, roofless courtyard surrounded by pillars separating it from the covered sections, which are set aside for prayer and study. The site is off-limits to tourists — although some take advantage of the doors being opened shortly before prayers to snap photos in the courtyard.
At the time of its establishment the university was one of the best in the world and hosted noted scholars such as Tunisian Ibn Khaldoun, seen as the founding father of sociology.
Another prominent figure believed to have studied there was Gerbert of Aurillac, a polymath who introduced Arabic numerals to Europe, is credited with inventing the mechanical clock, and later became Pope Sylvester II.
As well as preserving the city’s architectural treasures, the renovation work is part of Morocco’s wider efforts to promote moderation in Islam.
Model of tolerance
The scholars have left their mark on the city — such as at the Qarawiyyin library, home to some 4,000 manuscripts including an original donated by Ibn Khaldoun himself.
“It’s among the oldest libraries in the Islamic world,” said its rector Abdulfattah Boukachouf.
The 14th-century institution sits on a courtyard filled with the ringing of hammers of brass and silver workers. But in the reading room, last extended by Sultan Mohammed V — grandfather of the current King Mohammed VI — silence reigns.
