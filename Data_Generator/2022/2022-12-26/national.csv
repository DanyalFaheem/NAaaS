Syed Adeel Hussain, a head constable in Islamabad police, and Syed Sajjad Haider Shah, the taxi driver, were martyred and six other people, four policemen among them, injured in the blast at Islamabad’s I-10/4 sector. 
Television footage showed the fiery wreckage of a vehicle with several cops at the scene after the explosion. Shortly afterwards, the Islamabad police declared a “red alert” in the city. 
The outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, which called off a stop-start ceasefire with the government last month, claimed responsibility for the blast in a statement. It was established during investigation the taxi driver had no links with the suicide bomber. 
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the district administration of Islamabad on Sunday to hand over a cheque for Rs10 million to the family of Sajjad Haider.  The cheque was handed over to his family the same day. 
The premier also directed the interior ministry to ensure that the martyred policeman’s family received the Shuhada (martyrs) Assistance Package. 
Former prime minister Imran Khan had approved the Shuhada Assistance Package in 2018 under which the payment to the family of a martyred police official was raised from Rs2 million to Rs20m.

1,"Holding census before 10 years ‘unconstitutional’, says NP chief",Dr Abdul Malik Baloch directs National Party leaders to prepare themselves for elections.,"QUETTA: National Party (NP) President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch has opposed the upcoming national census and termed it ‘unconstitutional’, saying that Constitution did not allow that a census was taken before 10 years.
Presiding over a meeting of the party’s central committee in Karachi on Sunday, Dr Baloch said that the census in the country should be taken every 10 years and taking it after just five years was a violation of the Constitution.
The meeting also discussed several other issues, including the ongoing political situation, organisational matters, and the Reko Diq mining agreement.
NP Secretary General Mir Jan Muhammad Buledi quoted Dr Baloch as telling the central committee members that the leadership of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) had practically ignored democracy and the 1973 Constitution while passing a bill guaranteeing the protection for foreign investment in the Reko Diq project.
“Reko Diq is the national property of the people of Balochistan and it will not be relinquished under any circumstances,” Dr Baloch said.
“We have nothing to do with the government of the Pakistan Democratic Movement and its allies. Our alliance with the PDM was and still is on 26 points, which include the recovery of all missing persons, giving control of Balochistan’s natural resources to the Baloch nation, and ending interference by state institutions in the electoral process in the country,” he said.
Dr Baloch, who served as Balochistan’s chief minister from 2013 to 2015, said that no compromise would be made on the Baloch nation’s interests and no conspiracy against Balochistan and its people was acceptable.
He directed National Party leaders to prepare themselves for elections, give time to party workers and responsible colleagues, and go to their areas to mobilise party activists for polls.
He said Pakistan was a federation where all nations were constitutional and legal owners of resources in their provinces. The equality of nations should be recognised, he said.
The NP president said that his party had a clear policy that there should be no interference in the election process of the country and that the people should be given a free choice to elect their representatives without any fear, adding that his party believed in the power of the people.

2,Nasa partnership unveils new flood prediction technology,ISLAMABAD: The National Aeronau­tics and Space Administration (Nasa) of the United States is partnering with ...,"ISLAMABAD: The National Aeronau­tics and Space Administration (Nasa) of the United States is partnering with several leading scientific institutions to release a significant breakthrough in flood prediction technology to help save lives and aid early response to rising flood impacts worldwide. 
“This new technology covers the face of the globe, enabling us to observe flood risk and anticipate the likelihood of floods in ways never before possible,” said Dr Shanna N. McClain, Manager for Nasa’s Earth Science Applied Science Programme. 
“The technology we have developed will be transformative, enabling early action by communities around the globe — especially small island communities and developing states that lack the necessary early warning information to protect themselves and their loved ones during flood events. 
“Until now, comprehensive global flood early warnings have not been possible. Either due to limitations in hydrologic monitoring networks, forecast models, or expertise to operate and widely disseminate their results, especially in small and vulnerable countries, the “Model of Models” MoM will be a game changer,” said Chris Chiesa, Deputy Executive Director of Pacific Disaster Center, a key partner in the project. 
For the new technology to be put into use, it must reach the hands of local populations and decision-makers who need it the most — that is where the Pacific Disaster Center (PDC) comes in. 
The PDC is a University of Hawaii applied science and research center that specialises in disaster risk reduction 
science and technology that supports organisations worldwide in creating a safer world.
“Effective early warning information is proven to save lives. Flood early warning has so far been expensive, requiring hyper local investment, knowledge and maintenance. I am looking forward to helping PDC and Nasa make this powerful 
tool available to all communities to complement the efforts of national disaster management organisations and meteorological agencies to help early warnings reach the last mile,” said Omar Abou-Samra, Director of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)’s Global Disaster Preparedness Center.
The IFRC currently integrates all of PDC’s ‘DisasterAWARE’ early warning and risk information into its ‘Go Platform’, which provides its 192 national societies and more than 15 million volunteers with critical emergency needs information and the tools they need to provide adequate response. 
Pakistan Red Crescent Society provides aid to communities following catastrophic flooding in 2022 which caused more than 1,700 deaths and displaced more than 7.9 million people. 
Roughly half of the world’s countries lack adequate hazard early warning systems, according to a recent study by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO).
Floods are among most deadly and costly disasters worldwide and are only increasing in severity due to climate change. To make matters worse, a large percentage of the world’s population lack the tools needed to detect and respond to floods, leaving them vulnerable to the full force of flood impacts.

Some other embassies have also advised their staff and citizens in the federal capital to restrict their movement for some time, especially until Jan 1. 
According to an alert uploaded on the US embassy’s website, all government employees have been prohibited from visiting the Marriott Hotel. 
“The US government is aware of information that unknown individuals are possibly plotting to attack Americans at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad sometime during the holidays.  
“Effective immediately, the embassy in Islamabad is prohibiting all American staff from visiting Islamabad’s Marriott Hotel. Furthermore, as Islamabad has been placed on a red alert citing security concerns while banning all public gatherings, the embassy is urging all mission personnel to refrain from non-essential, unofficial travel in Islamabad throughout the holiday season,” the embassy stated. 
It advised embassy personnel to exercise vigilance at events, places of worship, and to avoid places with large crowds. 
“Review personal security plans, carry identification and follow requests from law enforcement, be aware of surroundings and monitor local media for updates,” the statement said. The advice came in the wake of a suicide bombing in the federal capital on Friday (Dec 23) which claimed the lives of a policeman and a taxi driver. 
According to the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), it was the first suicide attack in the capital since 2014. 
A total of 165 people lost their lives and over 600 were injured in 18 suicide attacks in the city from 2005 to 2014.  
The last suicide attack took place in March 2014 when two persons blew themselves up in the Judicial Complex at F-8 sector. 
“The PICSS militancy database shows the first suicide bombing in Islamabad after 9/11 was carried out in May 2005. Prior to 9/11, the only suicide bombing in Islamabad was an attack against the Egyptian embassy in 1995,” according to the think tank. 
The country has seen 504 suicide attacks over the last 22 years. A total of 6,748 people were killed and 15,111 injured in these attacks.

5,Gwadar’s Haq Do Tehreek — genuine movement or political ambition?,Senior leader of the movement blames the government’s “non-serious attitude” for the impasse.,"QUETTA / GWADAR: Two Balochistan government officials — home minister and an adviser to the chief minister — arrived in the coastal city of Gwadar on Saturday with one purpose: to negotiate a settlement and convince the protesters of Haq Do Tehreek (HDT) to end their around two-month-long demonstration.
Home Minister Mir Ziaullah Langove and Adviser to Balochistan CM Lala Rasheed met with the HDT leadership, but with little goodwill between the two sides, talks failed to make any headway.
Mr Langove said the government was making “all-out efforts’’ to address the protesters’ grievances and hoped to find a way out with negotiations.
While the minister appeared hopeful, HDT leader Maulana Hidayatur Rehman refused to even participate in the negotiations and the government delegation had to meet the second-tier leadership.
Mr Rehman blames the government’s “non-serious attitude” for the impasse.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Rehman — a veteran politician from Gwadar — said the provincial government has failed to address their concerns for a long time.
He said the locals were protesting over “genuine issues” including, illegal trawling in Gwadar’s water, high number of security checkpoints and trade on Pak-Iran border.
“These are issues of the Baloch. There is no trade at the Pakistan-Iran border. There are still a great number of checkpoints. The issue of illegal trawling still persists,” he told Dawn.
Illegal trawling has deprived local fishermen of their livelihood and if the provincial government was serious, it can easily put an end to this issue, he said while complaining of lack of efforts from the other side.
However, officials told Dawn that considerable progress has been made to address the protesters’ demands. Gwadar Deputy Commissioner Izzat Nazeer Baloch said eight trawlers have been confiscated by the fisheries department. And the fee for boat registration and renewal of licence has been decreased as per the protesters’ demand.
“Police, Pakistan Maritime Security Agency and Coast Guards, will carry out joint patrolling to curb illegal trawling,” DC Baloch said.

With respect to the trade on the border, he claimed smooth trade was going on at Kuntani border and the Iranian authorities have been requested to open more border crossings. 
“All unnecessary checkpoints have been removed but the HDT is demanding to abolish army camps which is impossible under the current security environment,” the deputy commissioner added.
“Multiple meetings were carried out before the sit-in and [Mr Rehman’s] genuine demands were met,” he claimed while referring to the ongoing sit-in at the Expressway, a road linking to key installations like the port and the under-construction international airport.
‘Politics’ behind the movement 
This is not the first mass mobilisation led by Mr Rehman. The coastal town of Gwadar — which seldom made headlines before being flushed with Chinese investment under CPEC — was catapulted into national discourse last year when Mr Rehman led historic protests seeking redressal of the same issues.
Those who saw the previous movement say the support for the movement has decreased this year. They link it to Mr Rehman’s ‘political aspirations’.
They claim the HDT leader has his sights set on the next general elections and the fresh movement has little to do with the rights of its people.
For Mr Rehman, contesting elections was his “democratic right” like every other politician. He also dismissed the claims of diminishing support. 
He said fishermen, locals, activists, labourers and above all “the nation” was standing with him.
Experts say Mr Rehman has presented himself as a popular leader amid a political vacuum that existed in Gwadar.
“In Gwadar, the Baloch follow Maulana because the political leadership, especially the nationalist leadership, has disappointed [them] due to corruption and vested interests,” said Prof Mumtaz Baloch, a political science professor at a university in Quetta.
Analysts say the fresh wave of protests will continue till the next general elections as Mr Rehman would like to transform it into an electoral victory.
“Maulana has political ambitions,” argues Nasir Sohrabi, who is an analyst hailing from a political family in Gwadar.
He added that if the HDT leader played his “political cards” well, he could give a tough time to Hammal Kalmati, the current provincial assembly member from Gwadar.
Mr Kalmati has been dominating the politics in the port town since long before Mr Rehman emerged on the national scene with his protests last year.
“[Mr Kalmati] is well aware of the grounded political realities in Gwadar, which is why over the last few months he has been showcasing his development works in Gwadar,” Mr Sohrabi added.
But for those who joined Mr Rehman in the protests, his political ambitions, if any, don’t matter as they rallied behind him over genuine issues.
Rukhsana Baloch was one of the women who joined the women’s rally in Gwadar, headed by Mr Rehman.
She told Dawn she went along with other women in her family for her brother Azeem Dost who has been missing for the last eight years.
The viewpoints on the movements — political or genuine — might vary, but the ground reality remained that a large number of people were out on the streets of Gwadar demanding their rights.
Understandably, the developments are being closely monitored by China which has heavily invested in the area and has been developing the deep sea port.
Commenting on the protests, Chinese Consul General Li Bijan said Mr Rehamn and his movement’s leaders met Chinese officials in Karachi and Islamabad.
“We have been assured the protests in Gwadar have got nothing to do with the CPEC,” said Mr Bijan while talking to Dawn at the Chinese consulate in Karachi.
However, he added that a deeper analysis shows the protests have “got to do something with the CPEC”.

7,"Toll rates in Pakistan relatively low, claims ADB",Bank’s report says more roads needed to be tolled to increase revenue.,"ISLAMABAD: A new report of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on road funds and user charges claims that toll rates in Pakistan are relatively low and increase in toll rates is not considered a viable option because toll roads have relatively low usage in the country, and it is expected that the users will opt to use non-tolled highways. 
The National Highway Authority (NHA) is now looking at increasing its revenue from the use of right-of-way highways, but this is unlikely to provide the necessary levels of revenue and additional sources will need to be identified. 
In 2009, the NHA issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) for leasing of the right-of-way that aim to commercialise the right-of-way and develop it as an important source of income for the road maintenance account (RMA). 
The ADB report was developed as part of the support of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) programme towards the establishment of competitive transport corridors, facilitation of movement of people and goods, and provision of sustainable, safe and user-friendly transport and trade networks. 
The report covers Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Uzbekistan.

Bank’s report says more roads needed to be tolled to increase revenue 

Titled ‘Roads Funds and Road User Charges in the CAREC Region’, the report released on Saturday said the road maintenance account (RMA) revenue growth has not been able to keep up with demand. 
Where the RMA revenue was able to cover over 70pc of needs at the time of establishment, coverage gradually decreased to 40 to 50pc in past years. 
This is causing a considerable problem, with highways receiving insufficient maintenance and becoming subject to accelerated deterioration. The inclusion of some state highways under the responsibility of NHA led to the worsening of road conditions as reflected in the average roughness of the network. 
Many of the poor highways have since been improved through capital investments financed outside of the RMA in a gradual improvement in network conditions.
The improved road conditions have also reduced the maintenance funding needs, although these remain nearly twice as high as the available funding from the RMA. Most high-volume highways and motorways have now been put under tolling and, although some additional road sections can still be tolled and provide additional revenue, this is very limited, report says. 
The RMA is an off-budget road fund, where all revenues are collected by NHA and deposited directly into the RMA bank account. The revenues do not go through the federal budget and are not included in or approved as part of the annual budgeting system. 
According to the CAREC report, in 2003-2004, the optimal funding needs were determined to be just under Rs7 billion. Over time, the needs grew to Rs64 billion in 2019–2020. To a large extent, this is because of the expansion of the road length under the responsibility of NHA, as state highways were transferred to NHA that was considered to be in a better position to finance their maintenance than the provincial governments. The upgrading and new construction of motorways have also led to increased funding needs, the report says. 
The RMA is largely dependent on toll revenue, which provided Rs25.6 billion in 2019-2020, equivalent to 64pc of total RMA revenue. The length of motorways and highways under tolls continues to expand, but is limited by the available network. 
The report says currently the NHA is faced with encroachment and unauthorised use of the right-of-way and has started mapping buildings and other structures in an effort to regulate the usage of the right-of-way. 
The NHA is also facing old leases that were signed by the provincial construction and works departments before the NHA was created, and that provide certain entities with the right to use the right-of-way at no or very little cost, often with very long lease periods of 99 years. The NHA aims to regulate these existing leases and introduce short-term leases for new service stations and other amenities.

8,"Sost dry port earns Rs1bn revenue in Dec, claims customs",GILGIT: A ‘record revenue’ of around Rs1 billion was collected from trade activities at the Sost dry port in the...,"GILGIT: A ‘record revenue’ of around Rs1 billion was collected from trade activities at the Sost dry port in the first 20 days of December, customs officials have claimed. 
The revenue was collected from duties and taxes as a result of clearances of import consignments that were stuck at the post due to a month-long strike in November. 
The strike was called by traders against the mismanagement of customs officials in October. They blamed the then Gilgit-Baltistan customs collector for ‘creating hurdles’ in the way of clearance of goods. 
After the strike, the Federal Board of Revenue changed the collector on Nov 29 and Abdul Waheed Marwat took charges as new collector customs on Dec 5. 
After his appointment, Mr Marwat met the traders as well as the GB Chamber of Commerce and Industry representatives and assured them of timely clearing of goods. 
A coordination committee with traders’ representatives was constituted to address the issues and ensure timely clearance and additional staff was deputed under the port’s assistant collector to expedite the process. 
After a break of two months, the clearance resumed on Dec 8 and around 170 containers carrying fabric, hosiery, shoes, dry fruits and miscellaneous items stuck at the port were cleared. 
Officials said the clearance of goods was a huge challenge as winter was approaching and heavy snowfall could result in closure of roads. 
GB importers and exporters association president Iqbal Hussein and local trader leader Haji Liaquat Ali said they cooperated with customs officials and fulfilled all legal formalities.

10,Literary Notes: Ram Babu Saksena and his history of Urdu literature,AN editorial note in January 1958 issue of literary journal Ma’arif expressed deep grief over death of,"AN editorial note in January 1958 issue of literary journal Ma’arif expressed deep grief over death of Ram Babu Saksena. The note read: “He was in love with Urdu and its service. He had made serving Urdu his life’s primary work […] and in the recently held session at Hindustani Academy, where the entire atmosphere was anti-Urdu, Saksena’s was the lone voice raised in favour of Urdu.”
Aside from his career as civil servant, Saksena was a researcher and wrote on Urdu and Persian literatures. Though he had many works to his credit, Saksena’s A History of Urdu Literature (Lucknow: Naval Kishore Press, 1927) gave him the everlasting fame. According to Dr Gian Chand, no other edition of the English version of this work was ever published. But Saksena’s fame kept on rising with the passage of time because of his other literary works as well as the Urdu translation of his signature work: Mirza Muhammad Askari translated Saksena’s A History of Urdu Literature from English into Urdu and the Urdu translation was first published in 1929 by the same publisher.
But Mirza Askari was not only translator; he had made many changes and had divided the book into prose and verse portions. The original work lacked samples or excerpts from Urdu poetry and Askari added them. Askari also added some other details that had been dropped by Saksena but were there in the source material, such as Muhammad Husain Azad’s Aab-i-Hayat’. Askari expressed his views in the footnotes wherever he had a difference of opinion. On top of it, Askari made necessary corrections at many places and added some new material.
Soon the Urdu version was prescribed as textbook. Surprisingly, its Urdu version remained in print for quite long — some 50 years — since as a textbook it was reprinted umpteenth times. It was referred to and quoted until a couple of decades ago, despite certain lacuna. A new lease of life was given to the book when some scholars, such as Ghulam Husain Zulfiqar and Tabassum Kashmiri, separately revised and updated the Urdu translation. Kashmiri appended footnotes and made corrections in the light of new research that had been carried out since the publication of translation. This edition too had run into several reprints. A Hindi translation in two volumes had appeared from Allahabad in 1951.
Some scholars have criticised certain aspects of Saksena’s history of Urdu literature. For instance, it does not have footnotes and does not mention original sources from where certain information was obtained. It not only failed to reproduce samples of poetry by great poets such as Ghalib even, it also lacked the chapter on modern Urdu poets. Saksena was well aware of these shortcomings and had promised to make up for these lapses in the second edition, but it never happened.
Ram Babu Saksena’s place of birth is often quoted to be Barely, UP, and his year of birth as 1892 or 1895. But Malik Ram in his Tazkira-i-Mah-o-Saal has mentioned that Saksena was born in Pipar, a village in district of Farrukhabad, UP, on Sept 27, 1896. Saksena died on Meerut Railway Station on Dec 20, 1957, while waiting to board a Calcutta-bound train where he was going to attend a literary gathering.
As put by Tabassum Kashmiri, Saksena did his MA and LLB from Allahabad University and in 1918 was made deputy collector. In 1922, he served as private secretary to Maharaja of Baroda. Later on, he worked as secretary and other high-ranking posts. Saksena participated in the establishment of Hindustani Academy and was also a member of Sahitya Academy.
Saksena’s other works include: European and Indo-European Poets of Urdu and Persian, Auraaq-i-Pareeshan’, and Poets of Urdu and Persian. His two works, namely, Muraqqa-i-Shuara and Masnaviyaat-i-Mir Bakhatt-i-Mir are criticised by some researchers and some have expressed their doubts about the book that claimed to be a collection of Mir Taqi Mir’s masnavis in his own writing as its genuineness is questionable.
Gian Chand has named three other books that Saksena was working on at the time of his death: Symbolism and Literature with special reference to Languages of India, Hindi Poetry of Urdu and Persian Poets, and Modern Urdu Literature. Gian Chand opined that none of these works could see light of the day.
Despite all its shortcomings, Ram Babu Saksena’s history of Urdu literature is a milestone in that it was the first-ever complete history of Urdu literature that covered both prose and poetry of Urdu, unlike other works, for example Azad’s Aab-i-Hayat that covered only poetry. Saksena’s critical evaluation is generally not accepted as of a high class but it goes to his credit that he was the first, even before progressives, to recognise and appreciate the poetic merits of Nazeer Akberabadi.
