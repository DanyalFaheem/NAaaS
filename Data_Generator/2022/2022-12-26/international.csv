0,Former guerilla leader Prachanda returns as Nepal PM,KATHMANDU: Nepal’s president appointed former guerrilla leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal prime minister for the third ...,"KATHMANDU: Nepal’s president appointed former guerrilla leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal prime minister for the third time on Sunday, 
after his Maoist party cobbled together a coalition following elections last month.
Dahal, better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda or  “the fierce one”, hid out for years in the jungle during Nepal’s 1996-2006 civil war that killed nearly 17,000 people and led to the end of the monarchy.
Sagar Acharya, a spokesman for President Bidya Devi Bhandari, said that Dahal, 68, has been appointed as the new prime minister and would be sworn in on Monday.
Following the 2006 peace accords, Dahal transformed his Maoist revolutionary movement into a political party and served briefly as prime minister in 2008-9, and again in 2016-17.
Elections in the Himalayan nation of 29 million people on Nov 20 saw the ruling coalition of prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, 76, lose its majority although his Nepali Congress remained the largest party.
Dahal’s Maoist CPN party has now formed an alliance with another communist party, the CPN (UML) — they used to be one party before splitting — and six others including combative television host Rabi Lamichhane’s new National Independent Party.
Lamichhane, who once held a Guinness record for the longest talk show at over 62 hours, was one of more than 30 independent and minor party candidates to enter parliament after the election in a 
wave of frustration at Nepal’s ageing political elite.

1,22 killed as savage US blizzard cuts power,Road ice and white-out conditions also lead to the temporary closure of some of the nation’s busiest transport routes.,"NEW YORK: More than 200,000 Americans woke up without power on Christmas morning as a days-long winter megastorm that hammered several eastern US states on Sunday left more than 20 people dead.
The extreme weather, a mix of prolonged blizzards and historic cold, plunged wind chill temperatures in all 48 contiguous US states below freezing this weekend, stranded holiday travelers with thousands of flights cancelled and trapped residents in ice- and snow-encrusted homes.
Twenty-two weather-related deaths have been confirmed across eight states, including at least seven fatalities in western New York, where ferocious snows, relentless winds and deep freezes have plunged Buffalo and surrounding towns into crisis.
While large swathes of the country have begun shovelling out from the massive storm and temperatures in some locations were returning to seasonal normality, Buffalo remained in the grips of  “a major disaster,” with emergency responders unable to reach several high-impact areas, a senior official said early on Sunday.
“We do have seven confirmed deaths at this point as a result of the storm in Erie County. There may be more,” county executive Mark Poloncarz told reporters.
He described ferocious conditions, with hours-long whiteouts and bodies discovered in cars and under snow banks in a region where Governor Kathy Hochul deployed the National Guard to help with rescues. “It was as bad as anyone has ever seen it,” Poloncarz said.
‘Conditions are just so bad’
The National Weather Service warned that blizzard conditions in the Great Lakes region caused by lake-effect snow would continue on Christmas Day, with  “additional snow accumulations of 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 metres) through tonight.” One couple in Buffalo, which sits across the border from Canada, said that with the roads completely impassible, they would not be making a 10-minute drive to see their family for Christmas.
“It’s tough because the conditions are just so bad... a lot of fire departments aren’t even sending out trucks for calls,” said 40-year-old Rebecca Bortolin. A broader travel nightmare was in full effect for millions.
The “bomb cyclone” storm, one of the fiercest in decades, forced the cancellation of more than 1,500 US flights on Sunday, in addition to some 3,500 scrapped and nearly 6,000 on Friday, according to tracking website Flightaware.com.
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg tweeted that  “the most extreme disruptions are behind us as airline and airport operations gradually recover.” But travelers remained stranded or delayed at airports including in Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis and New York.
Road ice and white-out conditions also led to the temporary closure of some of the nation’s busiest transport routes, including the cross-country Interstate 70.
Drivers were being warned not to take to the roads — even as the nation reached what is usually its busiest time of year for travel.
The extreme weather has severely taxed the country’s electricity grids, with multiple power providers urging customers to reduce usage to minimise rolling blackouts in places like North Carolina and Tennessee.

2,Over 180 Rohingya refugees feared dead at sea,57 survivors of another boat land in Indonesia after one month.,"NEW DELHI/BANDA ACEH: At least 180 ethnic Rohingya stranded at sea for weeks after leaving Bangladesh in November are feared dead, as their rickety boat is thought to have sunk this month, the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said.
Citing unconfirmed reports, the agency said the  “unseaworthy” boat probably sank after it went missing in the sea. “Relatives have lost contact,” the UNHCR wrote on Twitter on Saturday. 
Last week, two Myanmar Rohingya activist groups said up to 20 people died of hunger or thirst on a boat that was stranded at sea for two weeks off India’s coast. The boat with at least 100 people was said to be in Malaysian waters.A  broken-down boat carrying 57 Rohingya refugees landed on Indonesia’s  western coast on Sunday after a month at sea, police said.
“Those last in touch presume all are dead.”  More than 1 million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are living in crowded camps in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, including tens of thousands who fled Myanmar after its military conducted a deadly crackdown in 2017.

57 survivors of another boat land in Indonesia after one month

Earlier this month, the Sri Lankan navy rescued 104 Rohingya adrift off the Indian Ocean island’s northern coast.
Survivors land in Indonesia
Thousands  of the mostly Muslim Rohingya, heavily persecuted in Buddhist-majority  Myanmar, risk their lives each year on long, expensive sea journeys — often in poor-quality vessels — in an attempt to reach Malaysia or  Indonesia.
The wooden vessel with 57 men on board arrived around 8am local time (0100 GMT) on a beach in the westernmost Aceh  province, local police spokesman Winardy said.
“The boat had a  broken engine and it was carried by the wind to a shore in Ladong  Village in Aceh Besar (district),” Winardy, who goes by one name, said.
“They  said they have been drifting at sea for a month.” Winardy added that  police arrived at the beach after being informed by some locals that the  boat had docked there.
He said four of the men on board were sick and had been transported to a hospital.
Telmaizul  Syatri, the head of the local immigration office, said the refugees  will be temporarily housed at a local government facility.
“We  will coordinate with the International Organisation for Migration and  the UNHCR so that it can be handled well,” Syatri said.
This is the third Rohingya refugee boat to arrive in Muslim-majority Indonesia in recent months.
Two  boats carrying a total of 229 Rohingya landed in Aceh on Nov 15  and 16, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR).
Sunday’s  arrival comes after the UNHCR and Southeast Asian politicians called  for the rescue of another vessel carrying as many as 200 Rohingya  refugees, including women and children, which has been stranded at sea  for several weeks.
That boat has been reported in waters close to  Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and India in the Andaman Sea and the  Malacca Strait, one of the world’s busiest shipping routes.
The  UNHCR said last week that it has been in the water since late November,  and it had received reports of at least a dozen people dying on board.  Those left on the boat have no access to food or water.

3,Ex-president of Maldives gets 11 years’ jail,MALE: The Maldives criminal court on Sunday sentenced former president Abdulla Yameen to 11 years in prison and ...,"MALE: The Maldives criminal court on Sunday sentenced former president Abdulla Yameen to 11 years in prison and fined him $5 million after finding him guilty of corruption and money laundering charges related to receiving kickbacks from a private company. Yameen has denied any wrongdoing.
He lost power in 2018 but has been declared presidential candidate for the Progressive Party of the Maldives for an election due in 2023.
Already in 2019 he was sentenced to five years in jail and fined $5 million in 2019 for embezzling $1 million in state funds, which the prosecution said was acquired through the lease of resort development rights.
After his sentencing, Yameen was shifted to house arrest in 2020 and was freed months later.
Since his release, Yameen, the half-brother of former dictator Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, has returned to active politics with a campaign against Indian influence in Maldives, raising concerns in New Delhi.
Situated close to strategic shipping lanes in the Indian Ocean, Maldives is a focal point for competition between India and China over influence in the region.

4,‘Changed radically’: how women fight in Ukrainian city,"“I no longer feel I need to hide. All I want is revenge,” says a Ukrainian woman.","MYKOLAIV: The very day Russia launched its attack on her country, Svitlana Taranova enlisted in the Ukrainian army in the southern city of Mykolaiv, her birthplace.
“At 11 am on Feb 24 my contract with the territorial defence was signed,” said the former construction firm manager who is in her 50s. “It was the only possible decision, not a sacrifice,” she said. 
Mykolaiv came under threat rapidly after Kherson, 70 kilometres to the east, was taken by Russian forces.
President Vladimir Putin’s army needed to take Mykolaiv if it was going to conquer the Black Sea transport hub of Odessa, its main target and a two-hour drive to the west.
So the Russians began to pound Mykolaiv with artillery, massively and methodically.
Taranova, by now in the infantry, often found herself in close combat with Russian troops. “In the beginning, I was terrified of the cluster bombs, my heart missed a beat every time one went off,” she said.
But then the fear gave way to grim determination.  “I no longer feel I need to hide. All I want is revenge,” she said. While an AFP team was in Mykolaiv in September and October, the city was bombarded almost every night.
‘We feed the soldiers’
As Taranova was battling Russians in combat, other women contributed to the war effort in different ways, a team found. “We’re fighting here, too,” said Svitlana Nitchouk, 41, a bakery employee.
“We feed the soldiers.” When AFP met with her, she was watching an emergency unit clearing the rubble of an old apartment block in the city centre. The bakery where she works, on the ground floor, was badly damaged.
The remains of a nearby regional authority building miraculously holds up after a Russian missile destroyed seven floors.
Julia, a resident living nearby, said her apartment had already been hit three times.
The IT worker in her thirties took her daughter to the relative safety of western Ukraine, but regularly returns to Mykolaiv — mostly to distribute cars or military equipment to the fighters, funded by online appeals she has launched.
In another neighbourhood Julia Kirkina, a musicologist, sings and plays piano in a restaurant every Friday. “Music is one of the best cures for the spirit,” she said.
“My vocal therapy helps people stay calm and be optimistic.” Mykolaiv remained within range of Russian artillery fire for 262 days, and escaped bombing for barely 50, according to local authorities.

5,King Charles hails Britons’ ‘solidarity’ in first Christmas message,"“Such heartfelt solidarity is the most inspiring expression of loving our neighbour as our self,"" says King Charles.","LONDON: King Charles III has hailed the  “heartfelt solidarity” of people across the recession-hit UK struggling with a worsening cost of living crisis, in his first Christmas Day message as monarch.
Addressing the country from the Windsor Castle chapel where his mother, Elizabeth II, was interred in September, the 74-year-old also thanked people for the  “love and sympathy” expressed following her death.
Standing aside a sparkling Christmas tree, the sovereign noted in the annual royal message — broadcast at 1500 GMT — that it is a  “particularly poignant time for all of us who have lost loved ones”.
He then turned to the impact of the country’s growing economic woes, as decades-high inflation eats into earnings and escalates strikes over pay across the public and private sectors.
“I particularly want to pay tribute to all those wonderfully kind people who so generously give food or donations, or... their time, to support those around them in greatest need,” Charles said, dressed in a blue suit.
“Our churches, synagogues, mosques, temples and gurdwaras have once again united in feeding the hungry, providing love and support throughout the year.” The king also commended charities for their  “extraordinary work in the most difficult circumstances”.
He added:  “Such heartfelt solidarity is the most inspiring expression of loving our neighbour as our self.”
Charles ascended to the throne when Elizabeth died on Sept 8 after a record-breaking seven-decade reign.

6,Hezbollah hands over suspected killer of UN peacekeeper,"“The main shooter has been arrested by security forces after Hezbollah handed him over hours ago,” says security official.","BEIRUT: Lebanon’s powerful Hezbollah group has handed over a man suspected of killing an Irish United Nations peacekeeper earlier this month, a security official said on Sunday.
Private Sean Rooney, 23, was killed and three others injured on December 14 when their UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) vehicle was attacked near the village of Al-Aqbiya in the country’s south, a stronghold of the Iran-backed group.
UNIFIL acts as a buffer between Lebanon and Israel and operates near the border.
“The main shooter has been arrested by security forces after Hezbollah handed him over hours ago,” the security official said, declining to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media.
It was not immediately clear if the individual arrested was a member of the group.
Hezbollah is cooperating in the probe led by Lebanese military intelligence, the official said, adding that  “preliminary investigations are nearly complete.” Earlier this week, a judicial official said that Lebanese investigators had identified suspects in the attack, adding that there were  “at least two” shooters.
A car carrying armed men followed the UNIFIL vehicle, the judicial source had said, citing preliminary findings and calling the attack  “premeditated”.
Hezbollah has repeatedly denied involvement in the incident, and its security chief Wafic Safa has described the killing as  “unintentional”.
Witnesses said villagers in the Al-Aqbiya area blocked Rooney’s vehicle after it took a road along the Mediterranean coast not normally used by UNIFIL.

7,Paris shooting suspect admits hatred of foreigners,"""The suspect said he was depressive and wanted to kill foreigners after a burglary in his home in 2016,"" official says.","PARIS: A French man suspected of killing three Kurds in a Paris shooting last week has confessed to a “pathological” hatred for foreigners, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said on Sunday.
The 69-year-old man was due to appear before a judge on Monday, prosecutors said. The suspect spent nearly a day in a psychiatric facility before being returned to police custody on Sunday afternoon.
Beccuau said in a statement that the suspect was “depressive” and “suicidal” and said he “wanted to kill foreigners” after a burglary in his home in 2016.
The shooting at a Kurdish cultural centre and a nearby hairdressing salon on Friday sparked panic in the city’s bustling 10th district, home to numerous shops and restaurants and a large Kurdish population.
Three others were wounded in the attack, but none are in a life-threatening condition, with one now out of hospital.
The suspect said he initially wanted to kill people in the northern Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis, which has a large immigrant population. But he changed his mind as few people were around and his clothing made it difficult for him to reload his weapon, the prosecutor said.
He then returned to his parents’ house before deciding to go to the 10th district instead.
Clashes in Paris 
The shooting has revived the trauma of three unresolved murders of Kurds in 2013 that many blame on Turkiye.
Many in the Kurdish community have expressed anger at the French security services, saying they had done too little to prevent the shooting.
The frustration boiled over on Saturday and furious demonstrators clashed with police in central Paris for a second day running after a tribute rally.
The French capital’s police chief Laurent Nunez told BFM television channel that 31 officers and one protester were injured in the disturbances, while 11 people were arrested, “mainly for damage”.
Hundreds of Kurds in Syria demonstrated on Sunday in solidarity with the victims.
The suspect -- named as William M. by French media -- is a gun enthusiast with a history of weapons offences who had been released on bail earlier this month.
The retired train driver was convicted for armed violence in 2016 by a court in Seine-Saint-Denis, but appealed. A year later he was convicted for illegally possessing a firearm.
Last year, he was charged with racist violence after allegedly stabbing migrants and slashing their tents with a sword in a park in eastern Paris. The prosecutor said no links with an extremist ideology were found following a search of his parents’ home, a computer and a smartphone.
The suspect said he acquired his weapon four years ago from a member of a shooting club, hid it at his parents’ house and had never used it before.
‘He’s mad’ 
“He is mad, he is crazy,” his father said, describing him as quiet and reserved. He added that his son said nothing as he left his parents’ home on Friday.
Often described as the world’s largest people without a state, the Kurds are a Muslim ethnic group spread across Syria, Turkiye, Iraq and Iran.
Of the six victims of the attack, five were Turkish nationals and one was a French national.
Meanwhile, a top aide to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan blamed the street unrest that gripped Paris following the killing on outlawed PKK militants.
“This is PKK in France,” Erdogan’s foreign policy adviser Ibrahim Kalin tweeted, posting images of overturned and burning cars in Paris.
“The same terrorist organisation you support in Syria,” he wrote in apparent reference to the YPG.
The Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) is designated as a terrorist organisation by Turkiye and its Western allies and has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984.
Ankara has been feuding with the United States and European powers about their support for Kurdish fighters in the People’s Protection Units (YPG) militia, which it says is the Syrian offshoot of the PKK.
The YPG played a central role in the US-led campaign against the militant Islamic State group in Syria.
It is not proscribed as a terrorist group by either the United States or the European Union -- an issue of constant tension in their relations with Nato member Turkiye.
“The same PKK that has killed thousands of Turks, Kurds and security forces over the last 40 years. Now they are burning the streets of Paris. Will you still remain silent?” Kalin wrote.
Some of the people who joined the subsequent protests chanted slogans mentioning the PKK.

8,China to stop publishing daily Covid figures,Says the wave of infections is not being accurately reflected in official statistics.,"BEIJING: China will no longer publish daily figures for Covid-19 cases and deaths, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Sunday, ending a practice that began in early 2020.
Cities across China are struggling with surging virus cases, resulting in pharmacy shelves stripped bare and overflowing hospitals and crematoriums, after Beijing suddenly dismantled its zero-Covid regime earlier this month.
The decision to scrap the daily virus count comes amid concerns that the country’s blooming wave of infections is not being accurately reflected in official statistics.
Beijing last week admitted the scale of the outbreak has become  “impossible” to track following the end of mandatory mass testing. Last week, China also narrowed the criteria by which Covid-19 fatalities were counted — a move experts said would suppress the number of fatalities attributable to the virus.
The NHC did not offer an explanation for its decision to stop releasing daily Covid data. “From today, we will no longer publish daily information on the epidemic,” the NHC said.
“The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will publish information about the outbreak for reference and research purposes,” the NHC said, without specifying the type or frequency of information to be published.
’Can you talk about it?’
On Chinese social media, some users responded to the NHC’s decision with cynicism, pointing to the increasing discrepancy between official statistics and infections within their families and social circles.
“Finally, they are waking up and realising they can’t fool people anymore,” wrote one user on the social network Weibo.
Another user said:  “This was the best and biggest fake statistics manufacturing office in the country.” Under China’s new definition of Covid deaths, only those who die of respiratory failure — and not pre-existing conditions exacerbated by the virus — are counted. Only six Covid deaths have been reported since Beijing unwound most of its restrictions.
But crematorium workers interviewed have reported an unusually high influx of bodies, while hospitals have said they are tallying multiple fatalities per day, as wards fill up with elderly patients and they are forced to fill atriums with beds.
“Are there crematorium workers here? Are you overloaded? Can you talk about it?” another Weibo user wrote.
China’s censors and mouthpieces have been working overtime to spin the decision to scrap strict travel curbs, quarantines and snap lockdowns as a victory, even as cases soar.
While state media has largely refrained from reporting the grimmer side of the exit plan, they have, to some extent, said hospitals are under stress from an influx of patients and a shortage of anti-fever drugs.
In a rare acknowledgement this week, a senior health official in the eastern city of Qingdao was quoted by the media as saying half a million people are being infected daily.
1m cases in Zhejiang
Health authorities in Zhejiang, a coastal province of around 65 million people south of Shanghai, said the number of daily infections now exceeded the one million mark.
And in Beijing,  “a large number of infected people” were reported on Saturday.

9,Western claims show ‘effectiveness of Iran’s drones’,TEHRAN: Iran’s top general has said that Western claims its drones are being used by Russia against Ukraine show...,"TEHRAN: Iran’s top general has said that Western claims its drones are being used by Russia against Ukraine show the ‘effectiveness’ of Tehran’s unmanned aerial vehicles, Iranian media reported on Sunday. 
Kyiv and its Western allies have accused Russia of using  Iranian-made drones to carry out attacks against Ukraine in the months-long conflict, causing significant damage to civilian and energy infrastructure. 
In response, Western nations have sanctioned a number of Iranian firms and military generals, including the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, Major General Mohammad Bagheri.  Tehran had repeatedly denied supplying weapons “to be used” in the war in Ukraine, but admitted last month that it had sent drones to Russia before the invasion began in February. 
“Today’s atmosphere-creating by the world of arrogance (a reference to the United States and its allies) regarding the use of Iranian drones in the Ukraine war, is part of the enemy’s psychological warfare,” Bagheri said, according to Tasnim news agency. 
“Apart from the fact that many of these claims may be false, this, in fact, shows the effectiveness, importance and high rank of the Islamic republic in the field of drones.” 
The United States and Israel accuse Tehran of dispatching fleets of drones to its proxies in the Middle East, including Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement, the government of Syria’s President Bashar al Assad and Yemen’s Houthi rebels. 
Iran started developing drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), in the 1980s during its eight-year war with Iraq. 
Bagheri said that Iran will continue to develop UAVs. 
“The country’s armed forces will continue to grow and develop their  drones... we will cooperate with other countries on drones”, he was quoted as saying by Tasnim. 
“Our drone systems are at a high ranking in the world in terms of accuracy, durability and continuity of operation and mission execution,  and they perform various missions”, he added.

“Seven main leaders of the recent protests related to the UK were detained by intelligence services of the IRGC (Revolutionary Guards) including dual nationals who were trying to leave the country,” the statement read.
The British foreign ministry said it was seeking further information from Iranian authorities on reports that British-Iranian dual nationals had been arrested in Iran.
The reported arrests follow unrest triggered by the Sept 16 death in detention of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian who was arrested for wearing  “inappropriate attire” under Iran’s strict Islamic dress code for women.
The protests, in which demonstrators from all walks of life have called for the fall of Iran’s ruling theocracy, has posed one of the biggest challenges to the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution.
The government has blamed the unrest on demonstrators bent on destruction of public property and says they are trained and armed by enemies including the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia.

11,Israeli Zionist rabbi Haim Druckman dies at 90,"JERUSALEM: Rabbi Haim Druckman, spiritual leader of the religious Zionist movement in Israel, died on Sunday aged 90...","JERUSALEM: Rabbi Haim Druckman, spiritual leader of the religious Zionist movement in Israel, died on Sunday aged 90 after contracting Covid-19, a Jerusalem hospital said.
For decades Druckman was the most important figure in the religious Zionist movement, which represents roughly 12 percent of Israel’s Jewish population.
“The Hadassah hospital announces with sorrow the death of rabbi Haim Druckman,” the facility said in a statement, adding that he had been hospitalised for 10 days. Hadassah had said in a previous statement that Druckman had contracted Covid-19.
The religious school he presided over said he was 90 years old.
Druckman was a mentor to Israeli politician Bezalel Smotrich from the Religious Zionism political bloc, an extreme-right alliance.
Smotrich is set to be finance minister in incoming premier Benjamin Netanyahu’s new government.
“The Jewish people have lost one of the spiritual giants of his generation, a just (person), an educator, a man who dedicated his life to the Torah, to the Jewish people and the land of Israel,” Smotrich said.

Prime Minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu, who is preparing to present his religious-nationalist coalition this week, has vowed to preserve principles of tolerance.
But his political rivals have accused the veteran conservative leader of being vulnerable to his far-right allies policy demands.
“A situation whereby citizens of Israel fear threats against them based on their identity or values runs counter to the basic democratic and ethic principles of Israel,” President Isaac Herzog, whose role is largely symbolic, wrote on Twitter.
Netanyahu said twice on Sunday that his government would safeguard equal rights, however.
“We will not allow discrimination against members of the LGBTQ community or harm to the rights of any other citizens of Israel,” he said in one statement.
Earlier on Sunday, an incoming member of Israel’s government from the right-wing Religious Zionism party told public radio that hotels should be allowed to refuse services to people based on religious grounds as well as doctors, as long as others are available.
Netanyahu’s conservative Likud and like-minded religious-nationalist parties close to Israel’s ultra-Orthodox and West Bank settler communities won a comfortable majority in a Nov 1 election.
The inclusion of hardliners Itamar Ben-Gvir of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party and Bezalel Smotrich from the far-right Religious Zionism party in the coalition has dismayed Palestinians and liberal Israelis.
Separately on Sunday, Netanyahu voiced support for amending a law that prevents individuals who support terror or racism from running to be members of the Israeli parliament, saying he intends to replace that section while ensuring equal rights for Israeli citizens.

14,Brother and sister’s future separated after Taliban university ban,"The ban by the Taliban govt has sparked global outrage, including from Muslim nations who deem it against Islam.","KABUL: Marwa was just a few months away from becoming the first woman in her Afghan family to go to university — instead, she will watch achingly as her brother goes without her.
Women are now banned from attending university in Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where they have been steadily stripped of their freedoms over the past year.
“Had they ordered women to be beheaded, even that would have been better than this ban,” Marwa said at her family home in Kabul. “If we are to be so unlucky, I wish that we hadn’t been born at all. I’m sorry for my existence in the world.
“We are being treated worse than animals. Animals can go anywhere on their own, but we girls don’t have the right even to step out of our homes.” 
The 19-year-old had recently passed an entrance exam to start a nursing degree at a medical university in the Afghan capital from March. She was thrilled to be joining her brother, Hamid, in attending the campus each day. But now their futures have been pulled apart.
“I wanted my sister to achieve her goals along with me — to succeed and move ahead,” said Hamid, 20, a student of business administration at a higher education institute in Kabul.
“Despite several problems, she had studied until the 12th grade, but what can we say now?” 
Dreams crushed
The ban by the hardline Islamist government, which seized power in August last year, has sparked global outrage, including from Muslim nations who deemed it against Islam.
Neda Mohammad Nadeem, the Taliban’s minister for higher education, claimed women students had ignored a strict dress code and a requirement they be accompanied by a male relative to campus.
But the reality, according to some Taliban officials, is that the hardline clerics that advise the movement’s supreme leader Hibatullah Akhundzada remain deeply sceptical of modern education for females.
Girls have also been banned from secondary schools in most of the country.
Women have been slowly squeezed out of public life in recent months, pushed from government jobs or paid a fraction of their former salary to stay at home.
They are also barred from travelling without a male relative and must cover up in public. Women are prohibited from going to parks, fairs, gyms and public baths.
Marwa and Hamid come from an impoverished family but their parents had supported their pursuit of higher education.
With dreams of becoming a midwife, Marwa had planned to visit remote areas of Afghanistan where women remain deprived of health services.
“I wanted to serve women in faraway places so that we never witness the loss of a mother’s life during childbirth,” she said.
Instead she will now stay home to teach her six younger siblings, while her father, the family’s sole breadwinner, earns money as a vegetable vendor.
History repeatingMinister Nadeem insists women students behaved in a way that insulted Islamic principles and Afghan culture.
“They were dressing like they were going to a wedding. Those girls who were coming to universities from home were also not following instructions on the hijab,” he said in an interview on state television. But Hamid strongly rejected the justification for the ban.
“When universities opened under the Taliban, different days were specified for boys and girls,” he said.
“They (girls) were not allowed to enter unless they wore a mask and hijab.
How then can they (the Taliban) say they were without hijabs?” After the Taliban seized power, universities were forced to implement new rules, including gender-segregated classrooms and entrances, while women were only permitted to be taught by professors of the same sex, or old men.
Marwa’s mother, holding her newborn baby in her arms, said she felt history repeating itself. Two decades ago she was forced to quit her studies during the Taliban’s first regime between 1996 and 2001.
