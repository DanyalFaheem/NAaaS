ISLAMABAD: Before the Supreme Court turned down the ruling coalition’s plea late on Monday evening to form a full court to hear the petition against Punjab chief minister’s election, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry in the afternoon said his party had no objections to a full court, but they will not allow blackmailing and pressuring of the superior judiciary.
Talking to the media outside the apex court after the government leaders’ press conference earlier in the day, Mr Chaudhry even called the rulers “band masters” playing their own tunes.
“They were saying that court proceedings can be boycotted, but in the court they were speaking non-stop,” he said, adding the PML-N has a history of using pressure tactics and misdemeanour, especially in courts.
He said former law minister Farogh Naseem had to resign twice only to present his arguments in the court, but the incumbent law minster started his arguments on Monday, which showed the government feels its counsel was incompetent.

Law minister says only political party head authorised to declare party policy in view of SC verdicts

Chaudhry said the Tarar family (of Punjab minister Ataullah Tarar) was once again active in “corrupting” judges, just as their “elder Rafiq Tarrar did and which had been mentioned by former chief justice Sajjad Ali Shah too”.
He added that pressure tactics and threats could not undermine the apex court, adding strengthening the parliamentary party would be a leap forward for democracy in the country.
Former state minister Farrukh Habib said it was unfortunate that there was no proper chief minister for a province of 120 million.
“They tried to establish the government with the help of turncoats and failed. Now the entire PML-N was paying high fees to lawyers only to have a fake chief minister in Punjab,” Mr Habib taunted.
He maintained that the decisions taken by Hamza Shehbaz were all illegal and the expenses incurred on maintaining the large Punjab cabinet should be recovered from the personal account of CM Hamza.
PTI leader Maleeka Bokhari highlighted that the chief justice has the right to establish a full court over a reference, and such a decision could not be taken through “mob justice”.
Earlier, PML-N leaders, including Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar and Punjab minister Attaullah Tarar, said all the ambiguity over the issue of the CM’s election would be removed with the constitution of a full SC bench.
The law minister said presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association were also present during Monday’s proceedings and had endorsed the demand for a full court. He added that when former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was sentenced, a petition was filed against the decision, however, a full court in 2015 had said it was a prerogative of the party chief to file objections to floor crossing in assemblies.
Azam Tarar said only the head of a political party was the authority to declare party policy in view of previous judgements of the apex court.

1,‘Earlier SC verdict behind confusion over deputy speaker’s ruling’,Legal experts say apex court should revise its view on Article 63A; insist ‘boycotting proceedings’ would not help PDM cause.,"KARACHI: After the Supreme Court turned down a coalition request to form a full-court bench to hear the case against Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari’s ruling, legal experts remained split on whether the matter warranted closer scrutiny or not.
Several legal minds suggested on Monday that one way to draw the country out of the quagmire that is threatening its political and economic stability is for the apex court to revise its judgment in the presidential reference for the interpretation of Article 63A, to not count the votes of lawmakers who violated party policy.
Talking to Samaa TV, noted lawyer Salman Akram Raja said that the current crisis wouldn’t have occurred had the court not ordered the discounting of votes by lawmakers who violated party policy.
While referring to review petitions filed against the verdict, Mr Raja said the court could revise its judgement, but the possibility of this happening was bleak, since the same judges who had issued the earlier verdict, would hear the review petitions.

Legal experts say apex court should revise its view on Article 63A; insist that ‘boycotting proceedings’ would not help PDM cause

Similar sentiments were echoed by retired Justice Shaiq Usmani, who said that the court should revise its interpretation of the article in question and the ambiguities raised by the decision should be removed. While talking to ARY News, he advised the court to club the review petitions and applications filed by 20 PTI MPAs who were de-seated and then form a full court bench to hear the petitions.
PPP leader and eminent lawyer Sardar Latif Khosa said that the roles of the parliamentary party and party head were clearly defined in Article 63A and called the 3-2 verdict of the court “tantamount to rewriting the Constitution”.
However, he added that Mr Mazari erred in interpreting the judgment when he disregarded those votes during the run-off election.
No need for a full court bench
Talking to DawnNews, legal expert Asad Rahim said the case under consideration did not merit a full-court hearing.
“There is no conflict or a clash of precedent, neither is it a complex constitutional question or a legal crisis,” Mr Rahim elaborated.
He added that the only point to be decided in the case was whether Punjab Assembly deputy speaker ruling to disregard the votes cast by PML-Q members was legal or not.
Supreme Court Advocate Barrister Abid Zuberi, while talking to DawnNews, said that although every party has a right to demand the formation of a full-court bench, the discretion to constitute benches lies with the chief justice.
Mr Khosa was also of the opinion that the three-member bench currently hearing the case should continue as “there was no ambiguity” that warrants the constitution of a full court bench.
Boycott won’t impact the case
On the issue of the boycott of proceedings, as indicated by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah in his remarks outside the SC building on Monday, Mr Zuberi said the court wouldn’t be bothered by a boycott and will still decide the case.
“These things won’t matter in the court as it has to examine the facts and decide if Mr Mazari’s ruling was in the light of the June 17 verdict.” Mr Zuberi added.
Mr Usmani also said that there was no boycott in courts and once a lawyer appears in the court, the presence of their party is marked.
“After [appearing in court] a lawyer could say that they have been instructed by their client not to pursue the case and can urge the court to put their client on notice again,” Mr Usmani added.
Former PTI leader and keen legal mind, Hamid Khan, told ARY News that the language used by the members of the ruling coalition against the judiciary was “inappropriate” and an “attempt to pressurise the judges”.
He advised the court to “ignore the pressure” and decide the case on its merits.

2,1.5 million Afghans chose to stay back in Pakistan after US pullout,"UNHCR report reveals refugees in Asia-Pacific region grew by 138,400 last year.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan remains the largest refugee-hosting country in Asia and the Pacific as 1.5 million Afghans still prefer to stay in this country, even though one year has elapsed since the US forces beat a hasty retreat from Kabul.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in a report released on Monday that the number of refugees in Asia-Pacific region grew by 138,400 last year and now stood at 4.2m, or 19 per cent, of the global refugee population. This represents a three per cent increase over 2020.
By Dec 2021, the “Documentation Renewal and Information Verification Exercise” (DRIVE) found there were 1,252,800 registered Afghans, carrying “proof of registration” (PoR) cards, in Pakistan.
A further 129,700 unregistered members of registered families (UMRFs) were awaiting verification at the time of reporting.
According to official estimates, some 250,000 Afghans had entered Pakistan since Aug 2021.
Bangladesh is the second-largest host country with 918,900 refugees, followed by Iran, with 798,300 refugees.
China has over 304,000 refugees and asylum-seekers, over 303,000 Vietnamese among them.
According to the report, 95 per cent of the refugees in Asia Pacific region reside in developing (low- and middle-income) countries, while high-income countries host only five per cent of the displaced persons.
Impact on host nation
Comparing the size of the refugee population with that of the host country, gives a measure of the impact of hosting refugees and the scale of burden.
The number of refugees per 1,000 de facto inhabitants — a Global Compact on Refugees (GCR) complementary indicator — gives a perspective of the scale of burden in host countries.
The Afghan refugee population continues to be the largest in the region and the third largest globally, with 2.7 million refugees hosted by 98 countries.
The numbers grew by almost five per cent (118,000) in 2021, driven by new outflows to neighbouring countries: Pakistan (108,000) and Iran (27,800), as well as newly registered births and new recognitions in Europe (59,100) and Asia-Pacific (6,000).
Myanmar is the second-largest country of origin of refugees in Asia-Pacific and the fifth largest in the world. In 2021, the number of refugees grew by seven percent (73,800) to reach 1.2 million, with more than three quarters of them hosted by Bangladesh.
The increase in 2021 was primarily due to the registration of new births, including the backlog from 2020, as registration resumed after remaining suspended for two years on account of Covid-19.
The number of people displaced inside their own countries due to armed conflict or human rights violations continued to grow in 2021.
By the end of 2021, there were 4.4 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) in the region, a 23 per cent increase compared to the end of 2020.
In the region, seven countries reported conflict-induced IDPs. Countries with the most conflict-induced IDPs by the end of 2021 were Afghanistan (3.5m), Myanmar (671,000), and the Philippines (105,200).

3,Russian-Polish climber scales Gasherbum-II in 15 hours,Denis Urubko is the 15th climber to scale all 14 eight-thousanders.,"GILGIT: Russian-Polish climber Denis Urubko has set another record by climbing 8,035m Gasherbrum-II within a span of 15 hours, just days after summiting 8,051m Broad Peak.
This is his fifth summit of G2, while overall he is the 15th climber to scale all the 14 eight-thousanders and eighth to achieve the feat without the use of supplemental oxygen.
According to official Facebook page of Denis Urubko on July 23, the high-altitude mountaineer did another interesting composition in Karakoram. Starting at 3am from base camp, he went alone by the icefall, the long glacier and followed classical route of G2 with some stops for breakfast and lunch. He finally reached the summit at 18:20pm. Since no people were on the slopes in upper camps, Denis enjoyed his personal adventure in pure style.
He helped to fix ropes in the beginning on G2 and then took “a break” during which he made a powerful ascent on Broad Peak on July 19. He descended from the top directly to the base camp next morning at 4am after a 25-hour trip though extremely tired yet satisfied.
Such an adventure looks as a new step for that remote zone but for Urubko, it is the fifth time on G2 and 25th ascent on any mountain above 8,000m.
On July 19, climber Urubko summited Broad Peak (8,030m) in 14 hours. He started the summit push of Broad Peak from the base camp directly and reached the top within 14 hours. After summit, Urubko headed back directly to the base camp same day. Urubko completed the mission solo and scaled Broad Peak for the third time.
In a separate expedition, Ahmed Hussain and Abbas Ali from Shigar also summited G2.
Denis Urubko is on the top of Gasherbrum-II.

4,Two PIA planes avoid collision,The national carrier's Boeing 777 was enroute from Islamabad to Dubai while other was Airbus A320 from Doha to Peshawar.,"RAWALPINDI: Two Pakistan International Airlines planes averted a midair collision on Sunday over Iranian territory near the United Arab Emirates (UAE) airspace, as both planes were on the same route and altitude.
Due to alleged negligence of the Iranian Air Traffic Control (ATC), which is said to have cleared the same altitude, the two planes came dangerously close to each other. According to sources, a PIA Boeing 777 was en route from Islamabad to Dubai while the other airliner was Airbus A320 from Doha to Peshawar.
Captain Samiullah was flying Airbus A-320 while captain Athar Haroon was flying Boeing 777.
However, when the two planes came closer, one was asked to ascend and the other descended as per standard practice.
There is a system on all planes, called Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). It automatically guides the plane by communicating with the TCAS of other aircraft.
A PIA spokesman said: “PIA is writing to Iranian air traffic control (ATC) to investigate as the Iranian ATC instructed the plane, but it was wrong.”
He said a PIA flight (PK-211), a Boeing 777 from Islamabad to Dubai, was maintaining 35,000-foot altitude when it came close to Peshawar-bound PIA flight (PK-268) of Airbus A320 from Doha. He said PK-268 flight was flying at an altitude of 36,000 feet and was cleared to descend to 20,000 feet.
The descent would have come in the flight path of PIA flight of Boeing 777 PK-211, the spokesman added.
However, he added, the aircraft’s TCAS corrected the course for both the planes and automatically guided them.
