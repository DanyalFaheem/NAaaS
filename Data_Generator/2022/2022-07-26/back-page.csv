FOR paragliders Tom de Dorlodot and Hoaracio Llorens, it was a case of so near, yet so far. The first people ever to fly to K2 — rather than from its slopes — their aim was to soar over Pakistan’s highest peak.
They did reach 7,500 metres, but flying over the 8,611m peak — the world’s second-highest mountain after Everest — and breaking the altitude record of just over 8,400m proved insurmountable. Nevertheless, just flying across the ‘Savage Mountain’ was a feat in itself.
“As you fly closer and closer, it gets bigger and bigger … it’s an amazing experience,” Spaniard Llorens told Dawn in an interview on Monday, just hours before the 39-year-old flew back home from Islamabad. “It’s just a pity we couldn’t go over it.”
His partner De Dorlodot said: “We got really close.

Paragliders from Spain, Belgium hope their adventure will ‘open door’ for more expeditions

“We got the best conditions to fly towards K2,” the 37-year-old Belgian told Dawn. “But unfortunately there wasn’t enough wind to carry us over it.”
There have been several attempts in the past to climb K2 and then paraglide from its summit. In 2019, Austrian high-altitude mountaineer Max Berger paraglided from a shoulder of the mountain at 8,000m and flew down to the base camp at near 5,000m in about 17 minutes.
Llorens and De Dorlodot, however, are cross-country paragliders, who take off from the ground and use ascending thermal currents to gain altitude.
De Dorlodot believes the duo — who were accompanied by Spaniard Ramon Morillas, a paramotor pilot filming their expedition for the first few weeks — has broken new ground. “I think we’ve opened the door for more expeditions like this in the future and for more paraglider pilots to come to Pakistan and attempt this,” he said.
“We’d certainly be coming back and do what we couldn’t.”
Llorens struck the same chord. “For sure, we’re going to attempt it again,” he said. “It’s a challenge for us now and probably we’ll be back as early as next year.”
This was the seventh time De Dorlodot was flying in Pakistan while Llorens came for his third expedition in the country. This season, their expedition was arranged by Red Bull. In 2011, the duo broke the Asian distance record when they flew 226km from the remote Hushe valley to Gilgit.
De Dorlodot and Llorens were attempting to break the record of 8,407m set by Antoine Girard of France last year when he flew over the 8,051m Broad Peak, eight kilometres from K2.
Like Girard, they soared over the Baltoro Valley and flew past the Karakoram’s majestic peaks including Broad Peak, Muztagh Tower, Gasherbrum IV and, of course, K2.
“When we gained 7,500m on K2, we could see Nanga Parbat [the 8,126m peak which is the western anchor of the Himalayas],” recalled De Dorlodot. “It was special.”
During Pakistan’s busiest climbing season in over two decades, with a record number of expeditions attempting to scale Karakoram’s majestic peaks, they often flew over the mountaineers. “We saw many expeditions and flew over some climbers attempting Broad Peak. However, we couldn’t see climbers on K2 as we were on the other side of the climbing route. We did see the base camp though, and it presented a beautiful view with all the tents around and a flurry of activity going down there,” De Dordolot said.
At the end of their month-long stay, which saw them undertake over a dozen flights, the duo reflected on how tough it had been.
Setting their base camp at the Baltoro Glacier, some 50km from the peaks, they even had to ration their supplies after roads were cut off due to landslides in the region. “At times, we were getting tired while trekking to the point from where we would take off,” De Dorlodot reminisced. “But then you see the local high-altitude porters who climb with all the equipment without complaining. It kind of keeps you going.”

1,Two pro-democracy activists among four executed by Myanmar junta,"Executions spark widespread condemnation, heightening fears of more sentences and prompting calls for stern measures.","

YANGON: Myanmar’s junta has executed four prisoners, including a former lawmaker from Aung San Suu Kyi’s party and a prominent activist, state media said Monday, in the country’s first use of capital punishment in decades.
The executions sparked widespread condemnation — including from the United States and France — heightening fears that more death sentences will follow, and prompted calls for the international community to take sterner measures against the already-isolated junta.
The four were executed for leading “brutal and inhumane terror acts”, the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper said, without saying when or how the men were killed.
The junta has sentenced dozens of anti-coup activists to death as part of its crackdown on dissent after seizing power last year, but Myanmar had not carried out an execution for decades.

Executions spark widespread condemnation

Phyo Zeya Thaw, a former lawmaker from Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy (NLD) who was arrested in November, was sentenced to death in January for offences under anti-terrorism laws. Democracy activist Kyaw Min Yu — better known as “Jimmy” — received the same sentence from the military tribunal.
Family members of the two men gathered outside Yangon’s Insein prison after news of the executions was published, in the hope of retrieving their bodies, local media reported.
The two other men were sentenced to death for killing a woman they alleged was an informer for the junta in Yangon.
The NLD — which won a landslide in 2020 elections before being ousted by the military months later — said it was “devastated” by the news. Responding to media enquiries on reports of the executions, a junta statement said “it is as stated in the state media”.
Diplomatic condemnation
The executions drew immediate condemnation from the United States, which slammed the regime for the “execution of pro-democracy leaders and elected officials for exercising their fundamental freedoms”.
“We join the people of Myanmar in mourning,” the US embassy in Yangon said in a statement.
Japan’s government — a major provider of economic assistance to Myanmar — said it “seriously deplores” the executions.
France called the executions “a major regression and another phase in the escalating atrocities committed by the Myanmar junta since the coup d’etat”.
The sentiment was echoed by United Nations human rights chief Michelle Bachelet. “This cruel and regressive step is an extension of the military’s ongoing repressive campaign against its own people,” she said in a statement on Monday, slamming the military for showing “no regard for human rights”.
UN rights workers have said that under the junta’s martial law provisions, the death penalty could be given for 23 “vague and broadly defined offences” — which in practice could include any criticism of the military.
Myanmar expert Richard Horsey of the International Crisis Group (ICG) said on Twitter that the executions were “an outrageous act. And one that will create political shockwaves, now and for a long time to come”.
The United Nations’ Special Rapporteur on Myanmar Tom Andrews said the “depraved acts must be a turning point”.
“What more must the junta do before the international community is willing to take strong action?” he said.
A history of activism
According to Amnesty International, around 100 others are currently on death row after being convicted in junta courts.
But Phyo Zeya Thaw and Kyaw Min Yu were among the most prominent.
A hip-hop pioneer whose subversive rhymes irked the previous junta, Phyo Zeya Thaw was jailed in 2008 for membership of an illegal organisation and possession of foreign currency.
He was elected to parliament representing the NLD in the 2015 elections, which ushered in a transition to civilian rule.
The junta accused him of orchestrating several attacks on regime forces, including a gun attack on a commuter train in Yangon in August that killed five policemen.
Kyaw Min Yu rose to prominence during Myanmar’s 1988 student uprising against the country’s previous military regime, and had spent more than a dozen years in and out of prison under the previous junta for his pro-democracy activism.
The 53-year-old was arrested in an overnight raid in October.
The country’s military alleged voter fraud during the 2020 elections as justification for its coup on February 1 last year.
Suu Kyi has been detained since then and faces a slew of charges in a junta court that could see her face a prison sentence of more than 150 years.
The Nobel laureate, 77, learned of the executions at her latest hearing on Monday, a source with knowledge of the matter said.
She did not comment on the news but “looked sad”, the source said.

2,Ulema look to prevail upon TTP during Kabul visit,"Mufti Taqi Usmani-led delegation hopes senior Afghan Taliban leaders can convince TTP to ""soften stance"".","PESHAWAR: An eight-member delegation of Pakistani ulema, led by known religious scholar Mufti Taqi Usman, reached Kabul on Monday for talks with senior leaders of Afghanistan’s interim government, in a bid to persuade leaders of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) to further extend their ceasefire with Islamabad.
Senior Taliban officials and Pakistan’s ambassador to Afghanistan Mansour Ahmad Khan, received the delegation at the Hamid Karzai International Airport, Kabul. Video footage released by the Afghan Taliban showed the delegation receiving a warm welcome upon their arrival.
Head of Wafaqul Madaris Al-Arabia Qari Hanif Jalandhari and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) Senator Talha Mahmood were also part of the delegation. Sources said that senior officials briefed members of the delegation in Islamabad before their departure for Kabul.
Sources said the ulema would also meet TTP leaders during their stay in Kabul and would try to convince them to soften their stance and extend the ceasefire. The proscribed organisation’s commanders, including their chief Mufti Noor Wali Mehsud, have been in the Afghan capital for talks with the Pakistani officials.

Mufti Taqi Usmani-led delegation hopes senior Afghan Taliban leaders can convince TTP to ‘soften stance’

Before this, a 57-member jirga, consisting of elders from various Pakhtun tribes from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, had last visited Kabul in June and met TTP commanders, but their talks remained fruitless. Sources said the ulema would also seek assistance from senior members of the interim Taliban government to pressurise the TTP into making the ceasefire effective and softening their pre-conditions for talks.
One of the main demands of the outfit is the reversal of the merger of erstwhile Fata with the settled areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, something that the government has already termed ‘non-negotiable’.
“Our demands are very clear and especially the reversal of Fata with KP is our primary demand which the group cannot back down from,” said Noor Wali Mehsud, during an interview with a YouTuber in Kabul in June.
The TTP had announced ceasefire for an indefinite period before Eidul Fitr. Despite this, Pakistani security forces have come under frequent attack, particularly in the volatile Waziristan districts. Attacks on the security forces from the Afghan side have also increased in this time.

3,Doorman at elite Paris diner says he was told to ‘refuse non-whites’,The Manko restaurant and nightclub on the exclusive Avenue Montaigne is being investigated after black women were turned away.,"PARIS: A doorman working at an elite Parisian restaurant embroiled in a racism scandal said on Monday that he was told to refuse entry to non-white customers.
The Manko restaurant and nightclub on the exclusive Avenue Montaigne, a short walk from the Champs-Elysees, is being investigated after video emerged of black women being turned away.
The Peruvian-themed venue denies having a racist policy and has apologised to three shocked women who filmed their experience on July 16 and posted it on TikTok.
“They told me right away ‘you shouldn’t let many Africans in. You shouldn’t let many people from the Maghreb (North Africa) in’,” the doorman seen in the clip told BFM television on Monday.
Named as Damien by the channel, the bouncer was removed after the TikTok clip went viral but he said the directives came from “managers” and he was simply following the “policy of the establishment”.
The women in the video are turned away on the grounds that they are not in “evening wear” — even though they are in dresses and heels.
“But we’re in evening wear! It’s a joke... what should I have worn?” one of them can be heard saying, adding that it was her “first experience of racism”. Other black people can be seen being turned away, while white guests are allowed to enter.

4,UK PM rivals spar over tax in first head-to-head primetime TV debate,"Sunak vows to curb this before cutting taxes, and called Truss’ plans “a short-term sugar rush”.","

LONDON: Britain’s two prime ministerial contenders clashed fiercely over tax on Monday night in their first head-to-head televised debate, as former finance minister Rishi Sunak seeks to peg back the frontrunner, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss.
The primetime debate kicked off a crucial 12-day period featuring three such live TV duels and four husting events in front of Conservative members who will decide the contest and begin receiving their postal votes next week.
The weeks-old Tory leadership contest to replace outgoing prime minister Boris Johnson has turned increasingly acrimonious, with both sides’ camps fiercely briefing against each other.
That tone was carried into Monday’s live BBC debate, with Sunak savaging Truss’ plans to slash taxes immediately — a key dividing line between the two candidates.
“I don’t think that’s right, I don’t think it’s responsible and it’s certainly not Conservative,” he interjected as the foreign secretary detailed her proposals.
“If we follow Rishi’s plans, we are headed for recession,” she replied, adding that “this chancellor has raised taxes to the highest rate for 70 years”.
The leadership contest comes as Britain grapples with a cost-of-living crisis that has seen inflation surge to a 40-year high.
Sunak has vowed to curb this before cutting taxes, and called Truss’ plans “a short-term sugar rush”.
Opinion polls put Truss well ahead among the roughly 200,000 grassroots party members, after she and Sunak emerged as the run-off candidates in a series of votes by Tory MPs. The winner will be announced on September 5.
Sunak’s resignation as finance minister earlier this month over Johnson’s scandal-hit leadership helped spark the downfall of the outgoing premier.
That has angered some of the party grassroots.
Meanwhile, questions about his family’s tax affairs and his prior decision to retain US residency have also dented his previously high popularity among Conservatives.
Truss initially struggled to gain momentum in the race, but eventually made the run-off by winning over the party’s right-wing MPs with pledges to immediately cut taxes and deregulate.
Monday’s debate was held in Stoke-on-Trent, in front of an audience of people who all voted Conservative at the last general election in 2019.
The area, which backed Brexit heavily in the 2016 referendum, was once a traditional seat of the main Labour opposition. But it switched to the Tories — along with dozens of its other heartland seats — in 2019.
A weekend of bitter sniping by the two candidates’ camps over their respective stances towards China and other perceived UK national security threats, gave way to personal attacks on Monday.
Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries, a Truss supporter, openly mocked millionaire Sunak over his purported expensive taste in clothing, tweeting reports he wore an expensive suit and Prada shoes on a campaign visit.
She contrasted this with Truss being more likely to wear a low price pair of earrings.
The latest so-called blue-on-blue attack prompted an immediate backlash from other Conservatives, with one MP saying she had “muted” her colleague on Twitter while others urged a more conciliatory approach to the race.
“The puerile nature of this leadership contest is embarrassing,” Cabinet Office minister Johnny Mercer said. “Time to raise the standards.”
Newly-appointed finance minister Nadhim Zahawi also took to the airwaves to warn people “don’t vote for teams that are divided”.
The main opposition Labour party, which has been leading in polls for months but may have to wait until 2024 for the next general election, is eager to capitalise on fallout from the bitter Tory battle.
In a speech Monday, Labour leader Keir Starmer branded Sunak “the architect of the cost-of-living crisis” while calling Truss “the latest graduate from the school of magic money tree economics”.
