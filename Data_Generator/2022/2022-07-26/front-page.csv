• Counsel for ruling parties asked to come prepared for argument on Elahi’s plea today
• CJP says ‘expeditious’ decision must for smooth functioning of govt, constitutional machinery
ISLAMABAD: After a prolonged hearing that continued late into Monday evening, the Supreme Court finally rejected a set of petitions moved by the ruling coalition partners seeking hearing of Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi’s plea by a full court comprising all available judges to decide the issue of chief minister’s election.
However, the Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial-led bench provided another opportunity to the counsel representing Pakistan Democratic Move­ment (PDM) member parties to come prepared on Tuesday so that Mr Elahi’s challenge to Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Mohammad Khan Mazari’s ruling for discarding all 10 PML-Q votes could be discussed threadbare.
At the hearing, Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan, a member of the three-member SC bench, repeatedly mentioned that all what the court wanted was an explanation if the direction to lawmakers comes from party head or parliamentary leader.
Moved by Mr Elahi, one of the contestants for the top Punjab slot, the petition challenging the ruling of the deputy speaker was accepted by the apex court Friday midnight and later allowed PML-N leader Hamza Shehbaz to function as a trustee CM with limited powers.
On Monday, the SC that commenced the proceedings at 1pm and took two breaks finally decided at 9:15pm to reject the ruling allies’ request for formation of full court to hear the case, with the direction that the detailed reasons would be issued later as the court had heard arguments on merits as well.
Senior counsel Salahuddin Ahmed, who represented PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, argued during the hearing that since everyone had seen the wonders of the Sharifs of Model Town and the glorious past of the Chaudhrys of Gujrat, heavens would not fall if Mr Elahi or Mr Hamza became the Punjab CM. “But heavens will definitely fall if a large section of people takes away the impression that all the cases of political import are heard and decided by only a few members of the bench,” he added.
He said Mr Shujaat, being head of the PML-Q, had granted party tickets to all the 10 PML-Q lawmakers. He was of the opinion that in this polarized political matter, this would not be appropriate that the decision as to who would sit at CM office rested entirely on the three judges especially when earlier an eight-member bench in 2015 had already discussed the importance of the party head.
“It would be better to rely on the collective wisdom of the court. Especially when there were fissures and divisions, then collective authority of the apex court was better on polarized disputes.”
Justice Munib Akhtar, however, observed that the judges in a larger bench could also differ, emphasizing that chief justice was always the master of the roster.
Chief Justice Bandial while highlighting a different dimension of the polarized political environment remarked it was sad that such environment existed. Therefore, it was important to resolve these issues “expeditiously” so that the governments and the constitutional machinery could function smoothly, he added.
“We see crisis brewing and festering since April and after four months, do the counsel still want this environment of conflict to continue,” the CJP wondered, also highlighting that the full court would mean resumption of the case hearing not before September due to unavailability of judges amid current vacation.
“But we can’t allow such state of affairs to drag and prolong,” Justice Bandial said. The Supreme Court had already made an opinion on the presidential reference on Article 63A of the constitution, which was binding, he remarked.
The approach the PDM lawyers had taken was the prolongation or deferring of the matter when such important matter should not be deferred especially when the current economic condition made everyone concerned and the foreign exchange was falling. “Do you think it is because of our [court] intervention or due to the political intervention?” CJP questioned the counsel representing the ruling alliance.
He observed that a party with majority votes of 186 was sitting outside the assembly and the one with a minority vote of 179 was the chief minister. The CJP noted, “We want a solid footing to protect the current chief minister and that the affairs of the state must carry on and propriety demands that we should not give more time.”
Mr Ahmed, the counsel for PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat, however, apprised the court that they were not interested in prolonging the matter. He contended that he would be filing documents to show that the letter by his client was issued not only to the deputy speaker but also party lawmakers and even the latter came to see his client after the issuance of the letter.
While questioning if a decision taken by the legislature could come before the apex court, Farooq H. Naek the counsel for the PPP earlier requested the court to adjourn the matter until Thursday so that all the counsel representing different parties could come prepared.
The CJP, however, explained that “unconstitutional decisions” would definitely come before the apex court for verdict.
Irfan Qadir, who appeared on behalf of the Punjab Assembly deputy speaker, contended that the court should “not show haste in deciding the matter” and all judges should come on one page rather than a smaller bench deciding the matter. The counsel argued that too much hair splitting would create an impression of bias. He said he was not criticising the court rather laying emphasis on the legitimacy of the institutions.
Referring to the May 17 opinion of the court on Article 63A, he said it had held in clear terms that in case of any dispute, the fundamental rights of the party head would prevail than the members.
He also apprised the court that he would need further instructions from his client since his brief concern was only the request for the formation of the full court to hear the matter of national importance.
Mansoor Usman Awam, on behalf of Mr Hamza, also sought time for instructions to argue the matter on merits. Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar as well as PML-N prayed for the full court emphasizing that the points raised in the review petition by the Supreme Court Bar Association was very pivotal and should be decided along with the present case, because if it was accepted, the present case decision could be reversed.
The law minister said they were sitting in a coalition government and wanted to go back and seek instructions.
Earlier, former SCBA presidents, led by Latif Afridi, said the crisis had deepened and requested the apex court to constitute a full court to avert further deterioration of the situation. Hearing by the full court would save the system and the present crisis would be averted, the senior lawyers believed.
Advocate Ali Zafar, who represented Mr Elahi, said his client had complete faith in the court. He reminded the court that 15 such requests for full court formation had been rejected previously and only three to four times, a full court had been formed during the past 25 years.

1,18 perish as rains continue to batter country,"Met Office says weather system likely to persist for at least two more days; third monsoon spell wreaks havoc in Balochistan, KP.","

• Karachi reports 11 deaths as fresh spells bring misery for citizens
• Four killed in Balochistan, Hub Bridge among three washed away
• Army, rescuers put on high alert in Pindi
QUETTA / KARACHI: As authorities scrambled to mitigate the impacts of a torrential spell of monsoon rains, which has inundated cities and prompted flash floods across the country, at least 18 more people became victims of the deluge which washed away bridges and submerged houses and markets.
Due to incessant rain and subsequent accumulation of water, protests against administration officials erupted in several areas of Sindh against hours-long power outages and inundation of residential areas as they complained that officials were nowhere to be found.
Like the weekend, Monday also spelt misery for the citizens of Karachi. Though the fresh spell of the current monsoon season had weakened in Karachi, it still claimed 11 more lives in a single day: five people lost their lives due to electrocution, while six persons drowned.
Though several key roads were cleared by the administration after hours-long efforts in the city by the sea, life remained miserable in several low-lying areas, residential neighbourhoods, housing societies and commercial centres which remained flooded.
The rain, which started early on Sunday continued to come down till 10am with frequent breaks and by the end of first half of the day the city had received up to 204-millimetre rain.
The Met Office said that though the system took a break on Tuesday, it was likely to persist for at least two more days.
“The system is very much there. The latest data analysis suggests that the rain will continue for another two days. We may see moderate to heavy rains in Karachi and lower Sindh areas till late July 27,” said Sardar Sarfraz of the Met Office.
Due to the heavy downpour, Monday had already been declared a holiday for the citizens of Karachi and Hyderabad.
In Hyderabad, a 20-year-old man was reported dead in village Baqar Nizamani of Tando Mohammad Khan district.
In Dadu and Khairpur Mirs, two persons were killed and 10 others were injured in rain-related incidents.
Large swathes of land came under water as rain flooded streets and inundated standing crops in villages of the coastal districts of Thatta and Sujawal. The deluge also suspended traffic between Karachi and Badin as water accumulated on the national highway passing through the Thatta district.
The Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and the highway authorities managed to open one track for traffic after prolonged efforts to restore the traffic flow. According to official information, the Thatta district received 220 millimetre of rain this season.
In the coastal talukas of Ghorabari and Mirpur Sakro, hundreds of acres of agricultural land was submerged after a riverine stream started overflowing due to rain. The water level in Keenjhar Lake also witnessed an increase due to rainfall.
Due to the accumulation of water in several parts of the district, people from Thatta, Ketibandar, Ghorabari and other areas of the coastline converged on the national highway to protest the suspension of power and inundation of localities.
Dadu, with its streets submerged under 3 feet of water, presented a picture of a canal. The inundation resulted in power outages which caused a shortage of drinking water in the city. Mehar, Khairpur Nathan Shah and Johi towns of the district presented a similar picture.
Due to continuing downpours, rainwater could not be drained out in Jamshoro, Kotri, Sann and Bhan Syedabad towns where low-lying areas were inundated.
Various parts of Shaheed Benazirabad district, including Nawabshah, Daur, Daulatpur, Bandhi, Sakrand and Kazi Ahmed towns, received heavy downpour on Monday.

Balochistan
The third spell of monsoon rains wreaked havoc in various parts of Balochistan, washing away at least two bridges on the Quetta-Karachi National Highway – Landa Dora near Bela and Danda area of Uthal – and resulting in the death of four people in Khuzdar and Lasbela.
In addition, a section of the Hub Bridge, which connects Sindh and Balochistan, was washed away in a heavy flash flood late on Monday, cutting off Hub from Karachi.
“A 4km portion of the highway linking Quetta to Karachi is submerged due to floods,” a senior official of the local administration confirmed to Dawn. He said that one child drowned, while another man was killed in the Jam colony in the Bela area. Two more deaths were reported in Khuzdar’s Wadh tehsil in a roof collapse.
Officials in the Sibi district said that though the rain stopped for the last two days rivers passing through Sibi were still carrying high floods as their catchment areas were receiving heavy rains in Ziarat, Harnai, Loralai and Qila Saifullah districts.
Heavy rains were also reported in Bolan and Nasirabad districts.
The Bolan River in the Kachhi district was also carrying flood water that put pressure on the Quetta-Sukkur highway near the Dhadar area which suspended traffic on the highway for at least 10 hours.
“Landslides were also reported in some areas of Bolan pass due to heavy rains at the mountains,” official sources said, adding that the boulders were removed from the road and traffic was restored.
Similarly, the Hub Dam was receiving heavier torrents as the catchment areas of the dam received heavy rains over the last 24 hours. The spillway was seen overflowing as the dam was releasing over 150,000 cusecs of water into the Hub River.
Punjab
Punjab has received 150 per cent more rain so far as compared to the last monsoon, according to Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Faisal Farid. However, he ruled out the possibility of flooding in the province.
Meanwhile, the downpour submerged parts of Rawalpindi as rainwater entered shops and houses destroying property worth millions. Leh Nullah rose to 15 feet at Gowalmandi and Kattarian bridges.
The rain varying from light to heavy forced the local administration to turn on the flood sirens as a warning sign for dwellers along the banks of the nullah to move to secure places.
The army was put on alert and the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), Rescue 1122, Civil Defence Department and health department called their officials to deal with any emergency. “The army was not called, but put on alert to deal with any emergency,” Deputy Commissioner Tahir Farooq told Dawn.
Downtown, the rainwater submerged motorcycles and cars parked on the main roads of Mochi Bazaar, Bohar Bazaar, Sadiqabad, and Jamia Masjid Road.
In other parts of Punjab, at least 22 villages of Rajanpur and 13 in Mianwali districts were flooded due to rain in the mountainous areas of Sulaiman Range, the PDMA added.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
Meanwhile, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, over 260 persons were rescued from the low-lying villages located along the River Kabul after the river overflowed and entered several localities late on Sunday and Monday.
On the other hand, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) also issued a low to medium flood alert for the districts of Haripur, Swabi and Nowshera districts in anticipation of the opening of the Tarbela Dam spillways.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi said river water entered houses in Wazir Killay, Bela Mohmandan, Parchavay and Shah Alam Pul. He said that a total of 261 people, including 225 people from the Bela Mohmandan area, were rescued. Also on Monday, another 36 people were rescued from the Shah Alam area in light of flooding in the river.
Mohammad Hussain Khan in Hyderabad, Imtiaz Ali in Karachi, Aamir Yasin in Rawalpindi, Qurban Ali Khushik in Dadu, and Ghulam Hussain Khawaja from Thatta also contributed to this report.

2,PTI takes rulers to task over campaign against apex court,"Imran Khan shares video clip purported to be about the PML-N's ""attack"" on top court.","ISLAMABAD: At a time when his party leaders and lawyers were busy at the Supreme Court (SC), Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Monday shared a video clip purported to be about the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz’s (PML-N) “attack” on the top court in 1997.
“This video says it all about the Sharif mafia. Those who can’t be bribed must then be eliminated,” he tweeted with the video news report about the PML-N’s alleged attack on then chief justice Sajjad Ali Shah’s court.

 





 
On the other hand, PTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry, while addressing a news conference at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House here, demanded the names of Pakistan Demo­cratic Movement (PDM) leaders be placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) for what he called blackmailing the apex court to pressurise it.
Reacting to the press conference of the ruling coalition leaders, he said the “gang of thieves” had launched a direct attack on the Supreme Court. After the judiciary, he claimed, the PML-N would initiate a campaign against some army officers to pressurise both institutions, as 531 registered accounts had been allegedly used in the anti-judiciary campaign online.
Mr Chaudhry lamented that despite being on bail, a woman (in reference to Maryam Nawaz) continued to hold press conferences against the judiciary, and that too in the PM House.
Lashing out at PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, he said the entire Sindh became a dam whenever it rained, but the former president was focused on salvaging the Punjab government by spending Sindh’s money.
Regarding Zardari’s departure to Dubai, the former minister claimed he had fled the country knowing the incumbent government was going to last just a few days, adding that all the “crooks” could try to escape anytime, hence their names should be added to the ECL. He further said Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari should be reminded that his mother Benazir had been a victim of the PML-N’s tyranny and oppression her entire life.
Commenting on Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s tone and attitude during the ruling leadership’s press conference, Fawad questioned how many seats he held in Punjab. All these 11 parties together had been defeated by Imran Khan (in the Punjab by-polls), and they should have resigned if they had any shame, he remarked.
The PTI leader said the way things had been going for sometime, it showed the establishment was not neutral, adding Mr Khan had saved Pakistan from becoming Sri Lanka. He demanded a full court be constituted regarding the media cell allegedly working under the leadership of PM’s adviser Fahd Hussain.
Meanwhile, PTI Sindh President Ali Haider Zaidi also shared the same video clip as his party chief, calling it “one of the most shameful moments of #BlackmailerLeague’s politics”. He alleged the PML-N had stooped to all the way down to attacking the apex court physically as they got too used to “marzi ke faislay”.

 





 
In a statement, he said Pakistan was once more at a crossroads and now all eyes were on the SC, as the “crooked N-league” had resorted to their old tricks and once again started attacking the SC, so far not physically but through massive verbal abuse on TV and social media.
The PTI leader maintained people were upset, as they had been constantly lied to and their belief in the system was at an all-time low.
Dr Shahbaz Gill of the PTI asked on social media why not even a single government lawyer argued that the ruling of the Punjab Assembly deputy speaker was correct.

 





 
Former PTI minister Hammad Azhar also asked why Hamza Shehbaz was the chief minister for three months.
“Hamza Shahbaz has remained CM of Punjab since last 3 months despite never been elected by the majority in the house. The 12 parties are so petrified of Imran Khan that they are shamelessly and repeatedly insulting the public mandate. For how long?” he tweeted.

 





 
Another PTI leader, Farrukh Habib, also asked, in a tweet, in which capacity Maryam Nawaz had held a press conference in an auditorium of the PM Secretariat.

3,"Army vows to hunt down terrorists, ensure security",COAS Bajwa chairs 249th Corps Com­manders Conference against the backdrop of growing attacks in Balochistan and tribal areas.,"ISLAMABAD: The army’s top brass on Monday vowed to hunt down the terrorists involved in recent terrorism incidents and ensure security in the country.
The resolve was expre­ssed at the 249th Corps Com­manders Conference held at the General Head­qua­rters, whose agenda was dominated by a review of the border and internal security.
The meeting was chaired by Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa.
Corps Commanders’ Conferences have traditionally been a monthly feature at GHQ in which army’s operational and training matters are discussed, besides reviewing the security environment. However, this edition of the conference was held after an extraordinary break of over four months. The previous conference was held on March 15.
During this period, two formation commanders’ con­ference, a bigger army for­um attended by field formations, were, however, held. The two conferences were held in quick succession with an unusually short interval of less than two months.
The latest corps commanders’ conference was held against the backdrop of growing attacks in Balochistan and erstwhile tribal areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Forum took comprehensive review of the security situation with particular focus on Border and Internal Security,” the ISPR said.
Baloch fighters have stepped up attacks against security forces in Balochistan. In one recent such incident, the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) abducted Lt Col Laeeq Baig Mirza in the mountainous Hernai district near Ziarat.
He was later assassinated by the abductors. It was a rare attack on an officer of his rank in the volatile Balochistan province and that too while travelling with his family.
Similarly, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Daesh and other militant organisations targeted security forces. Attacks on polio teams in North Waziristan and Khyber districts were also reported.
The attacks in erstwhile tribal areas of KP happened as security forces’ ceasefire with banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan held. It is believed that most of these attacks were undertaken by Gulbahadur group.
Peace talks between the military and TTP are, meanwhile, continuing in Afghanistan.
The army has responded to these attacks by carrying out intelligence-based operations against the militant groups.
“COAS lauded successful ongoing counter terrorism operations and paid rich tribute to the supreme sacrifices of officers and men to ensure security of borders and safety of masses,” the ISPR said.
Gen Bajwa recalled army’s relief efforts for mitigating sufferings of the people affected due to floods and heavy rains in the country.
“The forum reaffirmed resolve of armed forces to extend complete support to civil administration in rescue/rehabilitation activities,” the ISPR said.
The PML-N government, which took office in April, has been hit by economic crisis and floods that have wreaked havoc in various parts of the country.

4,Ruling alliance to boycott court proceedings,"PM Shehbaz chairs late-night meeting with ruling partners to chalk out future plan, terms apex court's decision ""unacceptable"".","• Coalition leaders question impartiality of three-judge apex court bench, refuse to accept its verdict
• Maryam says anti-PML-N judges repeatedly included in benches; court favours PTI despite their ‘repeated mockery of judiciary’
ISLAMABAD: In a late-night press conference following the Supreme Court’s refusal to constitute a full court to hear the plea against the Punjab chief minister’s election, the ruling coalition announced a boycott of the proceedings.
Leaders of the ruling parties, who termed the SC decision “unacceptable”, joined heads at the Prime Minister Office to chalk out their future line of action. The late-night meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Addressing the press conference after the meeting on Monday night, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said any verdict announced by the three-judge bench hearing the case would be considered partial. Rejecting the apex court’s refusal to a full court, he said the government would not appear before this bench.
“The government wants no interference in its affairs and seeks a continuation of its policies for which it will also suggest parliament legislate to ensure respect to the people and judiciary’s verdicts.”
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) senior vice president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the case at hand would be a test for the SC. “Justice demands that if a question has been raised over a bench or judge, they should recuse themselves. This is supremacy of the law. It is for this bench to decide how their conduct will go down in history.”
Federal ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Ahsan Iqbal and allied party leaders also spoke on the occasion.
In a tweet, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz claimed that people now knew decisions in the country were made over personal likes and dislikes.

 





 
Earlier in the day, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, speaking outside the Supreme Court building, had hinted that the ruling coalition would boycott the case proceedings if a full court wasn’t formed.
Resuming the hearing of the government’s appeal for the last time after multiple breaks late at night, the court rejected the plea to constitute a full court, and adjourned the hearing till Tuesday morning (today).
Earlier in the morning, coming down hard on the judiciary and questioning its impartiality, all parties of the coalition government banded together and expressed ‘no confidence’ on the three-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial hearing a plea against the election of Hamza Shehbaz as the chief minister, and reiterated their demand for a full court to decide the case.
In the high-profile press conference held at the PM Office, the top leadership of all parties in the coalition government said they won’t acknowledge any decision announced by the three-member bench, which they alleged was inclined towards the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and ‘favouring’ the party, but were ready to accept the decision of a full court.
Kicking off the press conference, PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz said there were many respected judges in the apex court, and questioned why they were not hearing cases. “One or two judges, who have always been anti-PML-N and anti-government, are repeatedly included in benches,” she remarked, adding that “bench-fixing is as big a crime as is match-fixing”.
She alleged that court decisions were favouring the PTI despite the fact that it consistently mocked the judicial system. She questioned the state of justice in the country where decisions were handed out in favour of those who “abuse and bully institutions” the most.
Ms Nawaz also cited several examples of the PML-N leadership’s legal woes, claiming its leaders were being discriminated against. About her cousin, Hamza Shehbaz, being asked to carry on as the CM with limited powers, she asked: “Have you ever heard of a trustee chief minister?” Since the day Hamza was elected, he was not allowed to work. “He has been shuttling between parliament and courts. What kind of justice is this?”
Mentioning the April 16 election for the Punjab CM, the firebrand PML-N leader said 25 provincial lawmakers were de-seated by the court on a petition of the PTI for voting for Hamza. “Ninety-five per cent independent jurists said it was tantamount to rewriting the Constitution... 25 PML-N members were added to the PTI tally… the PML-N votes were deducted and the PTI’s increased.”
Answering a question as to why no action was being taken against former premier Imran Khan despite the ruling parties leveling so many allegations against him, and the status of the cabinet committee formed to try PTI leaders under Article 6, Ms Nawaz said they could only do something once they were done facing the many court cases against them.
‘Constitution can’t be altered over pressure’
Foreign Minister and PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari asserted that only three people could not decide the country’s fate, or whether this country would be run through a “democratic system, an elected system or a selected system”.
“Certain powers are unable to digest that Pakistan is moving towards democracy and people are making their own decisions,” he commented, without mentioning whom he was pointing at.
“It has been three months (since Khan’s ouster as the premier) and some powers, people, political parties and conspirators are unable to tolerate… a campaign is being run to keep Imran Khan at the forefront,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari alleged, adding that the campaign was a conspiracy against the country’s economic progress and democratic journey.
“We did not let any conspiracy succeed in the past and we will not let it happen now. We want institutions to remain uncontroversial and function within the ambit of the Constitution.”
He stressed the Constitution could not be altered due to any pressure exerted by the PTI chief.
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazl said fingers were being pointed at the judiciary. “The coalition government wants to strengthen the judiciary so their decisions speak for themselves. They shouldn’t have any conflict or give the impression of being biased,” he suggested.
Supremacy of law demanded
Muttahida Qaumi Movement leader Usama Qadri said the institutions should respect the wishes of citizens. He further said all the political parties were united on major political issues facing the country. “We want supremacy of the law and strengthening of democratic institutions. We are against any unconstitutional move, considering it against the people’s wishes.”
Jamhoori Watan Party leader and Minister for Narcotics Control Shahzain Bugti, joining the presser via a video link, called the full court a need of the hour to avoid any controversy at such a critical juncture.
Parliamentary leader’s powers
Awami National Party leader Aimal Wali Khan said all the state institutions should work under the ambit of the Constitution otherwise it would create chaos in the country.
“If a party president has no power then there is no use of his position and the parliamentary leader should be given his powers,” he asserted, maintaining, “the parliamentary leader is answerable to the party president”.
Regarding reports of the SC barring political parties’ leaders from entering its premises during the hearing, Muhammad Aslam Bhootani, an independent MNA from Balochistan, said: “We should all go there (SC) and confirm the veracity of the order.”
Balochistan National Party-Mengal MNA Agha Hassan Baloch called the ban regrettable.
Grand jirga
Balochistan Awami Party MNA Khalid Magsi suggested all stakeholders call a grand jirga to decide the country’s future as “we have failed to put Pakistan on the right track”. He said the Punjab CM’s election had caused uncertainty in Pakistan. “The country seems to be working like a tribal system.”
Independent MNA Mohsin Dawar said a country could not function without the supremacy of law. The only binding document, he added, was the Constitution that kept the entire nation unified. He said since Nawaz Sharif’s ouster over an iqama in 2017, it was no surprise how the judiciary had been making selective decisions, adding the missing persons cases were pending for years. “Our colleague Ali Wazir’s case best defines the judiciary. Every time he is produced in courts, either a judge goes on leave or is sent to another bench. If he gets bail in one case, another is instituted against him,” he added.
Commenting on the reports of ban on entry of ruling party leaders to the apex court, he said the judges’ mala fide and their intentions were evident from such decisions.
Other senior leaders of the ruling alliance present on the occasion included federal ministers Rana Sanaullah, Ahsan Iqbal, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Sherry Rehman, Khurram Dastgir, Tariq Bashir Cheema, Asad Mehmood, and PM’s Adviser Amir Muqam.
Coverage disruption
The live telecast of the press conference through the state-run Pakistan Television (PTV) was disrupted for a few minutes, sparking another controversy whether it was a bid to ‘censor’ the scathing statements of Maryam Nawaz. However, a senior PTV official told Dawn the disturbance was caused by the thunderstorm in the federal capital.
