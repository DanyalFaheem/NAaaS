0,"Cameras to remain turned off until revival of N-deal, Iran tells IAEA","Kanaani accuses IAEA chief of having ""unprofessional, unfair and unconstructive views"" on Iran's nuclear programme.","DUBAI: Iran will keep the UN nuclear watchdog’s cameras turned off until a 2015 nuclear deal is restored, the head of the country’s Atomic Energy Organisation said on Monday, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) it had removed IAEA equipment, including 27 cameras installed under the 2015 pact with world powers, after the agency passed a resolution criticising Tehran in June.
“We will not turn on the IAEA cameras until the other side returns to the nuclear deal,” Iranian nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami said.
The 2015 nuclear pact imposed curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Then-president Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2018, reimposing tough economic sanctions on Tehran.
Iran’s ruling clerics responded by breaching the pact’s nuclear restrictions.
Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani on Monday accused IAEA Chief Rafael Grossi of having  “unprofessional, unfair and unconstructive views” on Tehran’s nuclear programme.
He also added that Tehran hopes a return to the nuclear deal can be reached soon should the United States show goodwill.
“Iran is committed to talks and will continue until a good and sustainable deal is reached,” Kanaani said at his weekly news conference.
Iran’s nuclear programme is  “galloping ahead” and the IAEA has very limited visibility on what is happening, Grossi told Spain’s El Pais newspaper in an interview published on Friday.
Western powers warn Iran is getting closer to being able to sprint towards making a nuclear bomb. Iran denies wanting to. Indirect talks between Iran and the United States on reviving the 2015 deal have been stalled since March.
French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his disappointment to his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi at the lack of progress over talks, the Elysee Palace said on Saturday. 
The nuclear pact seemed near revival in March but talks were thrown into disarray partly over whether the United States might remove Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) from its Foreign Terrorist Organisation list. 
The IRGC controls elite armed and intelligence forces that Washington accuses of a global terrorist campaign.
The Biden administration has made clear it has no plan to drop the IRGC from the list, a step that would have limited practical effect but which would anger many US lawmakers.

1,Marauding monkeys injure 42 in Japan,TOKYO: Local authorities in Japan’s Yamaguchi city said on Monday they are turning to tranquiliser guns to ...,"TOKYO: Local authorities in Japan’s Yamaguchi city said on Monday they are turning to tranquiliser guns to confront marauding monkeys that have injured 42 people in recent weeks.
Japanese macaques are seen commonly across large parts of the country, and are a pest in some areas, eating crops and even entering homes. But a spate of monkey attacks in the city in western Japan has been unusual, with adults and children suffering wounds including scratches and bites.
“All of Yamaguchi city is surrounded by mountains and it’s not rare to see monkeys,” a city official from the agricultural department said, declining to give her name.
“But it’s rare to see this many attacks in a short period of time.” The injuries have so far been largely mild, but authorities are now turning to tranquiliser guns after traps they set failed to snare any of the pesky primates.
“Initially only children and women were attacked. Recently elderly people and adult men have been targeted too,” the official said. The city isn’t even sure if the attacks are the work of multiple monkeys or a single aggressive individual. The intruders have in some cases entered by sliding open screen doors, or entering through windows.
City officials and police have been patrolling the area since the first attacks around July 8, but have yet to snare any monkeys. The story has made headlines in Japan in recent weeks, with local residents reporting regular invasions.
“I heard crying coming from the ground floor, so I hurried down,” one local father told the Mainichi Shimbun daily. “Then I saw a monkey hunching over my child.”

2,Lawmakers urge Biden to seek Muslim attorney’s release,"Asim Ghafoor, slain journalist Khashoggi's legal counsel, was sentenced to three years in prison on July 16.","WASHINGTON: Five US lawmakers — two senators and three members of the US House of Representatives — have pressed President Joe Biden to raise Asim Ghafoor’s detention with the highest levels of the UAE government and advocate for his fair and humane treatment.
Asim Ghafoor, a Virginia resident, is a US-born Muslim of South Asian origin. He is also a board member of an Arab advocacy group called Dawn — Democracy for the Arab World Now.
Senators Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine and Representatives Jennifer Wexton, Don Beyer and Gerry Connolly wrote in their letter that Mr Ghafoor was “tried in absentia, detained without notice of his conviction, and sentenced to prison on to-date unsubstantiated charges by United Arab Emirates (UAE) authorities.”
Mr Ghafoor was a close personal friend of The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi who was murdered at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2018. He also served as Mr Khashoggi’s legal counsel.
Mr Ghafoor was detained by the UAE authorities on July 14 this year while transiting Dubai International Airport, and was sentenced to three years in prison on July 16. He was transiting through Dubai to attend a wedding in Turkey when arrested.
“The UAE’s decision to detain Mr Ghafoor — without notice or opportunity to seek legal counsel — represents a gross violation of his due process rights,” the lawmakers wrote.
Mr Ghafoor became popular in the American Muslim community after 9/11, when he represented many Muslims and Arabs facing deportation and detention on various charges. From 1997 to 2000, he served as Legislative Assistant to Congressman Ciro D. Rodriguez, a Texas Democrat.
Last week, US authorities rejected UAE’s claim that they had sought the lawyer’s arrest on previous charges of tax evasion and money laundering.  State Department spokesperson Ned Price said at a news briefing earlier this week that the US did not seek Mr Ghafoor’s arrest and has conveyed to the UAE its expectation that he “be afforded a fair and transparent legal process and that he be treated humanely”.
Mr Ghafoor’s attorney, Faisal Gill, told The Washington Post that his client had not heard anything about his conviction in the UAE before his arrest and had yet to see any documentation for the government’s charges. Mr Ghafoor was not facing any criminal charges in the United States, Mr Gill said.

3,Three killed in Canada shooting,Chief superintendent says police actively investigating series of shootings.,"LANGLEY: Three people including the suspected gunman were killed in a series of shootings early on Monday in the Canadian province of British Columbia, police said.
Authorities had earlier issued an emergency alert for multiple shootings in the city of Langley involving homeless people and asked residents to stay away from the area.
“We are actively investigating a series of shootings that has left two dead, one in critical condition and another with serious injuries,” said Chief Superintendent Ghalib Bhayani of the regional Royal Canadian Mountain Police force.
“At this time we don’t know the motive behind this deadly incident, nor if there was any relationship between the deceased suspect and the victims.”  A witness saw two black SUVs, similar to those used by police emergency response teams, in a ditch near one of the shooting sites. One vehicle had bullet holes in the windshield.
Police in Langley, a suburb of Vancouver, said they responded to “multiple reports of shots fired with several victims and several different scenes throughout the City of Langley, and one scene in the Township of Langley” and asked the public to remain out of several areas, including the parking lot of a casino and a bus stop.

4,Swathes of planet hit by extreme and deadly heatwaves,China swelters under record heat,"BEIJING: Cities across China were on red alert for heatwaves on Monday, as tens of millions of people were warned to stay indoors and record temperatures strained energy supply. Swathes of the planet have been hit by extreme and deadly heatwaves in recent months, from Western Europe in July to India in March to April.
Scientists say the extreme weather has become more frequent due to climate change, and will likely grow more intense as global temperatures continue to rise.
China is no exception and is sweating through one of its hottest summers on record.
In the eastern provinces of Zhejiang and Fujian, the mercury rose above 41 degrees Celsius (106 degrees Fahrenheit) over the weekend, reaching all-time highs in two cities.

China swelters under record heat

People in areas under red heat alerts — mostly concentrated in the southeast and northwest — are being ordered to “cease all outdoor activities” and “pay special attention to fire prevention”, the national meteorological service said in multiple notices over the weekend.
Saturday marked the “Great Heat” day on China’s traditional calendar, long recognised as the hottest period of the year, but this summer has been exceptionally warm.
Earlier this month Shanghai reco­rded its highest air temperature — 40.9C — since records began in 1873.
The scorching heat sent hundreds of people to the beach in Fujian’s Xiamen city on Sunday, while others hid from the sun under hats and face coverings.
China’s power grid is also feeling the strain from increased demand for air conditioning, with the country’s largest power plants generating at a record capacity in mid-July, according to energy industry publication Sxcoal.
Some local governments have resorted to turning off street lamps and raising peak period electricity tariffs for factories this month.
The ongoing heat wave, which has struck the lower reaches of the Yangtze River especially hard, will also “adversely affect local crops,” warned Fu Jiaolan, chief forecaster at the National Meteorological Centre.
Wildfire in California
Meanwhile, firefighters in California were making slow progress on Monday in the battle against a raging wildfire near Yosemite National Park that officials said would force some residents to evacuate with “just the shirts on their back”.
The latest blaze — which has already forced thousands to evacuate — comes as much of the United States remain in the grip of a sweltering heat wave.
The Oak Fire in Mariposa County has burned 16,791 acres (6.795 hectares) and is so far 10 per cent contained, Cal Fire, the state fire department, said.
“What we’re seeing on this fire is very indicative of what we’ve seen in fires throughout California, in the West over the last two years,” Jon Heggie, a Cal Fire battalion chief, told CNN.
“These fires are burning with just such a velocity and intensity it makes it extremely challenging and extremely dangerous for both the public and the firefighters,” Heggie said.
“It’s moving so quickly it’s not giving people a lot of time and they sometimes are just going to have to evacuate with just the shirts on their back,” he said.
The Oak Fire has forced the evacuation of several thousand people so far, officials said, and the hot and dry conditions and steep, rugged terrain are complicating firefighting efforts. 
Wildfire in Greece
In Greece, which is particularly vulnerable to fires, firefighters battled wildfires on three fronts on Monday as flames destroyed around 2,200 hectares (5,400 acres) of woodland in one of the country’s most important protected habitats.
Around 320 firefighters, two water-bombing planes and four helicopters deployed to contain the fire, now raging for a fourth day, at the Dadia National Park, known for its black vulture colony.
Some villages in the area have been evacuated. The flames have already destroyed some 2,200 hectares of woodland, according to a local mayor.
“It’s an uphill battle, a fight to ensure the survival of this exceptional ecosystem,” said the minister for climate crisis and civil protection, Christos Stylianidis, after visiting the affected area.
“It’s an ecological disaster, the damage is incalculable,” Soufli mayor Panagiotis Kalakikos told Star TV.

Democratic Taiwan lives under constant threat of being seized by China, which views the self-ruled island as part of its territory to be taken by force if necessary.
Russia’s assault on Ukraine has heightened fears that Beijing might similarly follow through on threats to annex its much smaller and outgunned neighbour.
This year’s five-day  “Han Kuang” (Han Glory) war games have incorporated lessons from the ongoing European war, simulating  “all possible actions” China could take to invade Taiwan, according to the defence ministry.
On Monday, reservists armed with machine guns ran into sandbagged trenches dug under a bridge before getting into firing position, in a drill aimed at blocking enemies from gaining access to the capital Taipei.
“The underground bunkers help cover the troops and ward off the enemy’s strike forces,” said Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at Taiwan’s Institute for National Defence and Security Research.
“They are part of Ukraine’s urban warfare.” Stinger missiles, effective against helicopters and low-flying planes, were also deployed in some high-rise buildings in the area, he said.
The highly portable missiles have been invaluable to Ukrainian forces fighting off Russian air power.
Separately, the streets in several northern cities were empty for 30 minutes as part of a civilian air-raid drill, with pedestrians and cars banned after sirens and text-message alerts warned of mock missile attacks.

6,Marcos Jr unveils economic blueprint for ‘turbulent time’,"MANILA: Philippine Pre­si­dent Ferdinand Marcos Jr vowed on Monday to slash poverty, rein in soaring food prices...","MANILA: Philippine Pre­si­dent Ferdinand Marcos Jr vowed on Monday to slash poverty, rein in soaring food prices and boost renewable energy, as he unveiled an ambitious blueprint for his six-year term.
In his first State of the Nation address, Marcos Jr offered a laundry list of targets, ranging from getting children back into classrooms, easing the debt burden of farmers, and expanding internet access.
Unlike his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte, who used to frequently go off script in a stream of consciousness and threaten to kill people, Marcos Jr stuck to a prepared speech that was methodical and heavy on numbers.
After inheriting an economy ravaged by Covid-19 lockdowns and inflation, the new president expressed cautious optimism for the future — even as the war in Ukraine and supply chain disruptions drive up food and fuel prices.
“I do not intend to diminish the risks and challenges that we face in this turbulent time in global history,” he told the audience of lawmakers, diplomats and judges.
“And yet I see sunlight filtering through these dark clouds. We have assembled the best Filipino minds to help navigate us through this time of global crisis.” Marcos Jr, who is the son and namesake of the country’s late dictator, spoke for 74 minutes without mentioning human rights, corruption or peace talks with militant groups.
Instead, the 64-year-old scion focused on the economy, clean energy, agriculture, and helping poor Filipinos.
Marcos Jr vowed to more than halve the poverty rate to single digits by the end of his term and offer financial relief to many farmers, including forgiving debts.
Renewable energy was  “at the top of our climate agenda”, he said, insisting it was time to reconsider building nuclear power plants in the disaster-prone country.
He also pledged to boost agricultural productivity and bring down food prices.
“These will not be done in one day, one month or one year. But we need to start now,” he said. Marcos Jr was swept to power by a landslide in the May 9 elections, completing his family’s remarkable comeback from pariahs in exile to the peak of political power.
Hours before his speech, several thousand protesters marched peacefully along a major avenue to oppose his victory and criticise his first weeks in office.
“He’s just sitting around, he’s busying himself revising history instead of doing the urgent work of stopping the rising costs of commodities especially food, distributing land to farmers and raising the wages of workers,” said Angelo Suarez, who volunteers for an agricultural workers union.
Outside Congress, thousands of Marcos Jr supporters wearing red, his campaign colour, also gathered, waving the Philippine flag and holding signs with slogans such as  “Progress”.
Congressman Ralph Recto said the new president’s spe­ech was  “brave, not boring” and gave the country a  “fiscal reality check”. The higher cost of living is worsening the financial misery of millions of Filipinos already struggling to feed their families.
The central bank recently raised interest rates for the third straight month as it struggles to rein in surging energy prices. Inflation hit 6.1 percent in June, the highest level in nearly four years.

7,Chinese astronauts set up new lab on space station,"The crew, dressed in blue jumpsuits, were seen floating around the brightly lit module before facing the camera and saluting.","BEIJING: Astronauts entered the new lab module of China’s space station for the first time on Monday, in a major step towards completing the orbital outpost by the end of the year.
The station is one of the crown jewels of Beijing’s ambitious space programme, which has landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon, and made China only the third nation to put humans in orbit.
Once completed, Tiangong — or  “heavenly palace” — will be constantly crewed by rotating teams of three astronauts, who will conduct scientific experiments and help test new technologies.
Wentian, the second of Tiangong’s three main sections, docked with the station’s core module Tianhe on Monday after successfully launching from southern China a day earlier, state media reported.
A few hours after docking, the three astronauts — who have been living in the core module since June — opened the hatch and entered Wentian, footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed.
The crew, dressed in blue jumpsuits, were seen floating around the brightly lit module before facing the camera and saluting.
Wentian will focus on life sciences and biotechnology research, according to official news agency Xinhua, including cell research and growth experiments on plants, fruit flies and zebrafish.
The module will have living space for three additional astronauts, housing up to six people during crew transitions, state media said. The third and final module, another lab named Mengtian, is scheduled for launch in October.
Tiangong, once completed, is expected to remain in low orbit 400-450 kilometres (250-280 miles) above Earth for at least 10 years.
Next year, China is also planning to launch a space telescope with a field of view 350 times that of Nasa’s Hubble Space Telescope.
The telescope will be positioned in the same orbit as Tiangong, allowing the station to dock with it for refuelling and servicing when needed.
China has poured billions of dollars into space flight and exploration as it seeks to build a programme that reflects its stature as a rising global power.
The programme has rapidly yielded successes in the last two decades, including launching the first Chinese astronauts, a historic first controlled landing on the far side of the Moon, and delivering a rover to the surface of Mars.
And after several missions to test the technologies needed for a constantly crewed outpost, it is set to finish Tiangong this year.
The station when completed is expected to have a mass of 90 tonnes, around a quarter of the International Space Station — from which China has been excluded by the United States.
The ISS — a collaboration between the United States, Russia, Canada, Europe and Japan — is due to be retired after 2024, although Nasa has said it could potentially remain functional beyond 2028.

Satellite broadband promises to bring coverage to the most remote areas of the planet and supply connectivity on aeroplanes and to products like connected cars.
Starlink heads the market with more than 2,000 tiny satellites in lower-earth orbit (LEO), just a few hundred kilometres above the Earth.
Eutelsat already provides some internet services through a deal with telecoms firm Orange, using its network of 35 larger satellites that operate thousands of kilometres from Earth in geostationary orbit (GEO) that are more commonly used for TV and other communications.
But Eutelsat said its tie-up with OneWeb, if it goes through, would be the first of its kind allying GEO and LEO satellites — OneWeb has 428 in orbit. The French firm said it would be  “uniquely positioned” to exploit a market that it expected to be worth $16 billion by 2030.
The  “potential all-share combination” would  “create a global leader in connectivity”, Eutelsat said in a statement. However, the European firms face stiff competition.

9,Strong dollar: Ten reasons why it matters to you,The greenback is now at a 20-year high against other world currencies.,"FRANKFURT: All things to all people, the US dollar leaves its imprint in every corner of the global economy: It is the currency in which vital raw materials are bought and sold, and it is the safe haven to which investors turn in times of trouble.
The greenback is now at a 20-year high against other world currencies, thanks in part to expectations that the Federal Reserve will increase its interest rates faster than most.
Here are 10 reasons why you should be paying attention: 
American abroad: A strong dollar is great if you are a US tourist. Hotels, meals or a designer bag all are cheaper by comparison, whether in London, the French Riviera or Cancun. It goes without saying that the reverse is true for the traveller going to the United States unless they bought their Disneyland tickets or Las Vegas junket a good while ago, it is going to cost more.
The joys of parity: This is a welcome added boon for Americans travelling to one of the 19 countries that use the euro and a small consolation for European tourists in the United States. No more mental arithmetic is required to convert between dollars and euros you can call it pretty much one for one now. 
Made in America: For shoppers around the world in search of top US brands, the strong dollar means they could end up paying a premium for them unless local distributors try to cushion the currency impact. 
Just in the past days, US companies such as Mattel Inc maker of the Barbie doll and Hot Wheels cars said it was seeing a hit from the dollars move upwards, even if consumers as a whole looked ready to take on higher prices. 
Emerging trouble: For Argentines, the rise of the dollar against the peso has meant a doubling of local prices in just one year and a spiralling economic crisis. Governments and businesses in a lot of emerging economies finance themselves by issuing bonds in US dollars.
The amount they owe has now surged in value when measured in their local currency. Tapping the market for more credit has also become more expensive because US rates have risen.
Raw materials: Countries like Turkey and Egypt that import a lot of their raw materials have been hit by a double whammy. Most commodities from oil to wheat are priced in US dollars, meaning they are paying more in their local currency for every barrel or bushel they buy. This comes as the price of many of those materials is already at a multi-year high due to the war in Ukraine, extreme weather and the aftershock of the Covid pandemic.
HOME SUPPORT: A strong dollar is good news for people in poorer countries such as Mexico and Guatemala who depend on money sent by relatives who work in the United States. The Covid-19 fallout dealt a sharp blow to these remittances in 2020 but they’ve seen a steady recovery since.
INFLATION: Even for richer countries such as Germany a strong dollar can spell trouble because it helps fuel already record-high inflation through more expensive imports. Local central banks have generally responded by raising interest rates, which makes credit dearer and slows economic growth.
ROUBLE RALLY : The Russian rouble is the only currency in the world that is comfortably in the black against the dollar this year — an unexpected outcome for a country under international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine. But this strength — a somewhat artificial result of controls on foreign exchange — does little for the ordinary Russian. 
BITCOIN: Marketed as the ultimate shield against inflation, the world’s largest crypto currency hasn’t lived up to its promise and is down by more than half this year despite runaway consumer prices in large parts of the world. Legions of individual investors drawn to crypto during last year’s bull market have now ditched the digital tokens to park their savings in a US currency they perceive as safer — and which is now starting to pay interest again.
BEEF UP: If the price of a hamburger is anything to go by, the dollar might actually be too strong and bound to fall back. The Economist’s Big Mac Index, which compares the price of the ubiquitous burger around the world, shows that the greenback is overvalued against all but a handful of currencies. The dollar is most expensive — and a Big Mac cheapest for a US traveller — in Venezuela, Romania and Indonesia. The opposite is true in Switzerland, Norway and Uruguay.

The former school teacher and state governor was elected to the largely ceremonial position last week with 64 percent of the vote by members of India’s parliament and state assemblies. Murmu, who is from the Santhal tribe and was born in eastern Odisha state, paid her respects before her inauguration at a memorial dedicated to India’s independence hero Mahatma Gandhi in New Delhi.
“I started my life journey from a small tribal village,” Murmu, 64, said after taking the oath of office in parliament. “From the background I come from, it was like a dream for me to even get elementary education,” she added.
“But despite many obstacles, my resolve remained strong and I became the first daughter from my village to go to college.” Murmu’s win was considered a certainty because of the strength of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies in the parliament and state assemblies.
Analysts said the move would probably help Prime Minister Narendra Modi extend his base among the poor tribal communities ahead of his re-election bid in 2024.
“Her assuming the Presidency is a watershed moment for India especially for the poor, marginalised and downtrodden,” Modi said on Twitter after Murmu’s address.
Murmu said her election would give hope to those left behind by India’s recent economic growth.
“It is a matter of great satisfaction to me that those who have been deprived for centuries, who have been away from the benefits of development...are seeing their reflection in me,” she said.

11,Tunisians vote on constitution set to bolster one-man rule,"TUNIS: Tunisians were voting on Monday on a new constitution promoted by President Kais Saied, which has been...","TUNIS: Tunisians were voting on Monday on a new constitution promoted by President Kais Saied, which has been criticised for giving his office nearly unchecked powers and threatening to install an autocracy in the birthplace of the Arab Spring.
The referendum comes a year to the day after Saied sacked the government and froze parliament in a power grab that his rivals condemned as a coup.
His moves were, however, welcomed by many Tunisians fed up with a grinding economic crisis, political turmoil and a system they felt had brought little improvement to their lives in the decade since the 2011 overthrow of dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.
Most think Monday’s vote will pass, but turnout will gauge Saied’s popularity after a year of increasingly tight one-man rule that has seen scant progress on tackling the North African country’s economic woes.
Early on Monday, a handful of voters queued as they waited for a polling station to open in Tunis, guarded by a pair of soldiers and four police officers. After casting their ballots, they emerged with purple ink on one finger to prevent fraud.
Electoral board chief Farouk Bouaskar said turnout had reached 13.6 percent by 3:30 pm, and that voting had so far taken place without incident.
Speaking mid-morning, Saied told journalists the country faced a  “historic choice” and a free vote.
“Together we are founding a new republic based on genuine freedom, justice and national dignity,” he said. Imed Hezzi, a 57-year-old waiter, said he had  “lots of hope” Saied would improve the country. “Tunisia will prosper from today onwards,” he said after voting.  “The start of the new Tunisia is today.” Some 9.3 million out of Tunisia’s 12 million people are eligible to vote.
No minimum participation has been set for the constitution to pass, nor any provision for a  “no” result, and Saied’s critics have warned Tunisia risks sliding back towards dictatorship.
The new text would place the head of state in command of the army, allow him to appoint a government without parliamentary approval and make him virtually impossible to remove from office. The president could also present draft laws to parliament, which would be obliged to give them priority.
The new charter  “gives the president almost all powers and dismantles any check on his rule and any institution that might exert any kind of control over him,” declared Said Benarbia, regional director of the International Commission of Jurists.
“None of the safeguards that could protect Tunisians from Ben Ali-type violations are there any more.” Saied’s charter would replace a 2014 constitution that was a hard-won compromise between Islamist-leaning and secular forces after three years of political turmoil. His supporters blame the resulting parliamentary-presidential system and the dominant Islamist-influenced Ennahdha party for years of political crises and corruption.
Saied’s draft constitution was published this month with little reference even to an earlier draft produced by a committee he appointed himself.
Sadeq Belaid, a mentor of Saied who led the process, warned the president’s first draft was far removed from that of the committee and risked creating a  “dictatorial system”. A slightly amended version did little to address such concerns.
Opposition parties and civil society groups have called for a boycott, while the powerful UGTT trade union has declined to take a position. Benarbia said the text  “doesn’t even envisage the possibility of a no vote”.
Saied, a 64-year-old law professor, won the 2019 presidential election in a landslide, building on his image as incorruptible and distanced from the political elite.
He has appeared increasingly isolated in recent months, mostly limiting his public comments to official videos from his office — often diatribes against domestic foes he brands as  “snakes”,  “germs” and  “traitors”.
He has vowed to protect Tunisians’ liberties and describes his political project as a  “correction” and a return to the path of the revolution. Mongia Aounallah, a 62-year-old retiree, said she hoped the referendum would lead to  “a better life for our children’s children”.
“The schools are a catastrophe,” she said.  “The situation is catastrophic. Everything is catastrophic.” Labourer Ridha Nefzi agreed. “I came to vote to change the situation of the country,” the 43-year-old said.
“The country’s run into a brick wall. But today we turn a new page.” But while Saied enjoys some popularity, that will be tested by soaring inflation, youth unemployment of 40 percent and a tough loan deal with the International Monetary Fund. Voting is set to end at 10pm and initial results are expected on Tuesday evening.

12,Pope apologises to Canada’s natives for ‘evil’ of church schools,"Calls for ""serious"" investigation to help survivors and descendants heal.","MASKWACIS: Pope Francis apologised on Monday to Canada’s native people on their land for the Church’s role in schools where indigenous children were abused, calling their forced cultural assimilation a “deplorable evil” and “disastrous error”.  
Speaking near the site of two former schools in Maskwacis, Alberta, Francis apologised for Christian support of the “colonising mentality” of the times and called for a “serious” investigation of the schools to help survivors and descendants heal.
“With shame and unambiguously, I humbly beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians against the indigenous peoples,” said Pope Francis, who arrived and left in a wheelchair due to a fractured knee.
The address to the First Nations, Metis and Inuit people was the first apology on Canadian soil by the pope as a part of tour to heal deep wounds that rose to the fore after the discovery of unmarked graves at residential schools last year.
The 85-year-old pope had promised such a tour to indigenous delegations that visited him earlier this year at the Vatican, where he made an initial apology.
Indigenous leaders wearing eagle-feather war headdresses greeted the pope as a fellow chief and welcomed him with chanting, beating of drums, dancing and war songs.
“I am here because the first step of my penitential pilgrimage among you is that of again asking forgiveness, of telling you once more that I am deeply sorry,” he said.
He was addressing the indigenous groups in the Bear Park Pow-Wow Grounds, part of the the ancestral territory of the Cree, Dene, Blackfoot, Saulteaux and Nakota Sioux people.

Musk’s tweets came after a Wall Street Journal report that cited unidentified sources saying he had engaged in a brief affair with Shanahan. The paper said the affair prompted Brin to file for divorce from Shanahan earlier this year and ended the tech billionaires’ long friendship.
Dismissing the report, Musk tweeted,  “Sergey and I are friends and were at a party together last night! I’ve only seen Nicole twice in three years, both times with many other people around.
