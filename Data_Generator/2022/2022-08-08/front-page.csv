0,FIA team to trace culprits behind online campaign over Balochistan copter crash,"PM Shehbaz terms social media campaign ""ridiculing the sacrifices"" of martyrs ""horrifying"", calls for ""deep reflection"".","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Sunday sprang into action and constituted a team to trace and arrest those running a negative social media campaign on the tragic incident of army helicopter crash amid flood relief operation in Balochistan, after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said belittling and ridiculing the sacrifices of martyrs was horrifying.
“The social media campaign belittling & ridiculing the sacrifices of our martyrs was horrifying. This is what self-righteous political narratives do: they poison the minds of the youth & weaponise hate speech. 
“Which way are we headed? The moment calls for a deep reflection,” PM Sharif wrote on his Twitter handle. 

 





 
Also, the head of ruling coalition partner Chaudhry Shujaat came up with an appeal to politicians to put aside their political affairs and expediencies and foil the propaganda campaign against the armed forces, a day after a joint resolution was adopted by the Balochistan Assembly “saluting the brave senior officers of Pak-Army who sacrificed their lives to protect the lives of flood-stricken people of Lasbela”.

PM calls for reflection amid ‘horrific’ drive against martyrs

Earlier, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), condemning the “highly unacceptable and regretful social media campaign”, stated it “caused deep anguish and distress among the families of martyrs and rank and file of the armed forces”. 
On Sunday, the FIA constituted a four-member team and tasked it with pointing out, arresting and taking legal action against those involved in running a negative social media campaign on the tragic incident of helicopter crash.  
The FIA team, to be headed by additional director general of cyber crime wing Mohammad Jaffar, will include director (cyber crime, north) Waqaruddin Saeed and additional director Imran Haider as its members, according to Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb.
After the chopper crash, a section of social media activists and certain political zealots launched an abhorrent and unacceptable online campaign to advance their personal and political malice, which drew a strong reaction from the people belonging to all walks of life, political leadership and the state institutions.
The ruling coalition at the Centre has been blaming the social media team of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf for launching the smear campaign on the behest of PTI chairman Imran Khan. The PTI leadership was also accused of not attending the funeral of Lt-Gen Sarfaraz Ali and other martyrs. However, the PTI leadership attempted to negate the impression as President Arif Alvi phoned the families of the martyrs while Mr Khan visited the residence of martyr, Lt-Gen Ali.
Meanwhile, the Balochistan Assembly in a joint condolence resolution moved by treasury and opposition members and adopted a day ago paid tribute to the six army officers who embraced martyrdom in helicopter crash in the Winder area of Lasbela district while supervising rescue and relief operations in the flood-stricken areas.
The joint resolution stated, “We salute these brave senior officers of Pak-Army who sacrificed their lives to protect the lives of flood stricken people of Lasbela.” It said their sacrifice would always be remembered as they did not bother about their lives while performing their duty and the entire nation was in shock on their shahadat. 
“Whenever we need the help of the people, our brave army personnel and officers rush to provide help and comfort to the needy people,” the resolution said and expressed deepest grief and pain over the tragic incident that deprived the nation of the senior army officers.
The resolution was moved by Adviser to the Chief Minister on Home and Tribal Affairs Mir Ziaullah Langove on behalf of Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, Mohammad Khan Lehri, Mir Nasibullah Marri, Mohammad Khan Toor, Mobin Khilji, Nawabzada Gohram Bugti and Maulana Noorullah. 
Provincial ministers Noor Mohammad Dummar and Syed Ehsan Shah, opposition leader Sikander Khan, Abdul Khaliq Hazara, lawmakers Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi, Khalil George Bhutto and other members paid tribute to the martyrs.
They recalled that Lt-Gen Ali, as IG Frontier Corps (South) and XII Corps Commander, played an important role in maintaining law and order in the province and guided the youths of Balochistan towards the right direction. His role in the progress and development of Balochistan was unforgettable, as he personally visited far-flung areas of the province to get himself aware about the issues being faced by the people, they added.
While strongly condemning the negative propaganda from some political circles and quarters, they said they were “agents of the enemies” of Pakistan. “If we have such elements, who are making baseless and negative propaganda, we do not need foreign enemies,” they pointed out.
They said the entire nation condemned this propaganda and standing with the families of martyrs.
Appeal to foil campaign
Meanwhile, PML-Q president and ex-premier Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain on Sunday urged politicians to fully support the armed forces, putting aside their political affairs and expediencies. “Politicians should keep [their] political issues and expediencies aside and foil the propaganda campaign against the armed forces fully supporting defenders of the country,” he said.
Everything could be tolerated except propaganda campaign against the armed forces, he said, adding that the whole nation shared the sorrow and grief of the families of the martyrs.
He said Pakistan Army helped and served the nation in every calamity, trouble and difficult times. “The armed forces have played an important role and laid down their lives in restoring peace and order and ending terrorism in the country and thus deserved respect and support.”

1,Notices by probe body to party leaders baffle PTI,• Party claims FIA issued notices to leaders who were not office-bearers at time of funding  • Minister says implementation of...,"• Party claims FIA issued notices to leaders who were not office-bearers at time of funding
• Minister says implementation of ECP ruling in progress
ISLAMABAD: As investigations into prohibited funds received by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) inch forward, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry on Sunday questioned the issuance of notices to four PTI leaders, including former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser.
At a press conference, the former information minister said he could not comprehend why notices were issued to the party leaders even though they did not hold any office in 2011-12 when the party received these funds.
The Federal Investigation Age­ncy (FIA) has summoned former Sindh governor Imran Ismail and MPA Dr Seema Zia in Karachi; Mah­moodur Rasheed, Punjab’s local government minister, in Lahore; and Asad Qaiser in Peshawar.
“I do not understand in what capacity FIA is issuing notices to our leaders. These people were not public office-holders in 2011-12. However, we are cooperating with the FIA,” he added. 
Mr Chaudhry said PTI had provided details of its accounts to the Election Commission of Pakistan.
He said the party would approach the courts for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) audit to be finalised within 15 days. He claimed that PML-N had received Rs10 million but had not declared the funds.
Accusing the PML-N of money laundering, he alleged that the party had spent Rs1.3 billion on media campaigns but had not mentioned any source.
He further claimed that ex-president and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Asif Ali Zardari headed one part of the party while Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari headed another. According to the PTI leader, the explanation given by the PPP leaders was that one party funded another; however, under the ECP rules, no political party could fund another party. He asked why the ECP was “protecting the PPP and the PML-N”.
Fawad also claimed that certain “journalists and Baloch insurgents” were harping on about PTI chief Imran Khan’s disqualification. 
“Who has the courage to disqualify Imran? You are not announcing elections because you fear he will win a two-thirds majority,” he said, adding that a campaign was underway against Imran Khan.
“The government is holding by-election on nine seats because it is fed up with its allies. They want to gather seats gradually to secure a majority. This is their political move,” he went to allege.
Probe into May 25 cases
During the press conference, the former minister said that PTI — which rules Punjab along with PML-Q — would also launch an investigation into the cases registered against its workers and leaders in the province following the long march on May 25. He said that investigation team could summon Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Ataullah Tarar, who had served as home minister in Hamza Shehbaz’s cabinet before its dismissal as a result of a Supreme Court verdict, and expected that they will cooperate during the investigation just like the PTI has decided to cooperate with the FIA in the funding case.
It may be noted here that the PML-N government in Punjab had stopped the May 25 march of the PTI with iron hand and had taken into custody scores of PTI leaders in a late-night crackdown. The provincial government then led by Hamza Shehbaz had also registered cases against the PTI leaders.
ECP verdict
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb said implementation on the prohibited funding case ruling was in progress, reported APP. “The decision in the funding case has been given [by the ECP] which is being implemented as per law,” she said in a statement while reacting to Fawad Chaudhry’s comments on social media. She said the PTI had been declared a “foreign aided” party under the Political Parties Order 2002. Imran Khan had submitted a false affidavit with ECP five times as per the decision, she added.
The PTI sought 51 adjournments, changed nine lawyers, and filed 11 petitions in courts, the minister observed. “The lies, fraud and drama of a foreign agent and foreign aided party must end,” she added.

2,PSO may stop serving airports amid auction row with CAA,Expresses inability to serve only loss-making airports if profitable fuelling facility at Karachi airport is auctioned.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid current financial challenges, the state-run Pakistan State Oil (PSO) has expressed its inability to serve only the loss-making airports if the profitable fuelling facility at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport is auctioned out to a private supplier, with PSO officials asking another state-owned entity, the Civil Aviation Authority, to adopt a uniform policy for all airports across the country.
The PSO has already moved the competition appellate tribunal against the Competition Commission of Pakistan’s (CCP) direction to tender the existing fuel farm, Eastern Joint Hydrant Depot, at Karachi airport and notices had been issued to the CAA and other respondents on the matter, the country’s largest fuel supplier reminded the federal government.
In a communication to the petroleum secretary, PSO Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Syed Mohammad Taha said the company maintained jet fuel refuelling facilities at 10 airports across Pakistan as per international standards and had been investing millions of rupees every year to upgrade and maintain these facilities for increasing productivity and efficiency.
However, the state-owned supplier warned, “PSO be­ing a public sector entity cannot agree to operate at loss-making airports only, while we are being removed from a major airport on the pretext of promoting competition.”  
It recalled that when CAA had issued a tender for establishment of jet fuel refuelling facility at Skardu airport, PSO explained that flights for Skardu got two-way fuel from Islamabad airport and due to the high road transportation cost, fuel price at Skardu airport would be very high, discouraging airlines to refuel from Skardu. Yet in the national interest, PSO participated in the tender and agreed to establish a mobile facility for a temporary period to support the government vision to promote tourism, it explained.
The CEO also reminded the federal government that a few years back, a private troubled entity, Hascol Pet­ro­leum, had approached the CCP complaining that the CAA had not been allowing them to establish fuel farm at Karachi airport for jet fuel business. Subsequently, the CCP directed the CAA to tender the existing Fuel Farm i.e. Eastern Joint Hydrant Depot (EJHD), a joint venture of PSO, Shell Pakistan and Total Pakistan for past six decades.
PSO later challenged the CCP direction before the appellate tribunal, which is pending adjudication. 
Regardless of PSO’s continuous engagement with the CAA and explaining that fuel farm can be leased through “direct allotment” as per CAA Policy 2019, but the CAA in violation of its own policy issued a letter of interest (LOIs) for operation and management of EJHD, Karachi airport, according to the PSO. Strangely eno­ugh, it noted, the CAA also claimed the ownership of Hydrant Refuelling System, which was purchased by PSO and its partners in the joint venture through 1994 agreement of sales.
Three other airports 
The PSO chief pointed out that the CAA was also planning to offer loss-making Sukkur, Nawabshah and old Gwadar airports for takeover and establishment of jet fuel facilities under ‘direct contracting’, without considering the option of tender.  He complained that the CAA’s current approach was not public-sector friendly, as it was asking PSO to operate at all loss-making airports and “at the same time evicting PSO from Karachi airport which is to some extent a viable business option”.
PSO officials said the government had been approached to not only look into the matter but also ask the CAA to adopt a uniform policy for all airports whether it seeks to lease out jet fuel refuelling facilities at all airports through tender or through direct allotment to PSO. 
“It is unfair to expect PSO to feed smaller airports at a loss while major airports are offered for competition which should be on overall basis instead of pushing for selective competition,” an official said.
When the CAA was approached by Dawn for comment, the officials said they could not respond to questions before Wednesday (due to two-day public holiday for Ashura on August 8 and 9). 
SOS calls 
PSO has been raising SOS calls to avoid international default as delay in payments by different entities had exhausted its liquidity. As a result, the company has not been able to deposit Rs81bn to the federal government’s local currency account for onward transmission to Kuwait Petroleum Cooperation (KPC) under a contractual obligation. The government had to order special arrangements for payment of Rs32bn to meet the obligation.
Just last week, the federal government was informed that PSO’s receivables had touched Rs608 billion as of July 28, including Rs340bn from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL). A major contributing factor was the LNG supply that added a cash shortfall of Rs213bn since July 1, 2021. SNGPL, on its part, had been constrained by delayed payments by Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) whose receivables jumped to Rs113bn from Rs43bn since January 1, 2022. CPPA had another Rs182bn direct payables to PSO on account of fuel supplies, including Rs16bn accumulated since July 1, 2022.
Moreover, PSO had not been able to deposit Rs16bn to the federal government against an integrated-term finance certificate (ITFC) facility, which has been deferred to avoid PSO’s international contractual obligations. There has been a decline of sales of high-speed diesel (HSD) and petrol for PSO by 28pc and 32pc respectively, having an impact of Rs69bn on collections, while about 17.8pc devaluation of rupee against dollar in July alone had resulted in increased cost of procurement of these products by PSO by Rs63bn. It was reported that PSO had foreign exchange loss of about Rs85bn over the years of which Rs28bn was settled in the last quarter of 2020 while Rs55bn was still outstanding.
Despite these challenges, the petroleum secretary had warned the ECC, PSO had met its contractual international payments in July 2022, but “this will not be possible in August”, resulting in disruption of the national oil and gas supply chain in LNG and petroleum products. While PSO’s collections during the first fortnight of August are expected at Rs157bn, it is supposed to make an international payment of Rs267bn in the same period, indicating a net deficit of Rs100bn.

3,FO rejects New Delhi’s ‘ludicrous comments’ on OIC stance,"In statement distributed at UN headquarters, OIC reiterated calls for implementing UNSC resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir.","ISLAMABAD: The Fore­ign Office on Sunday categorically rejected the ludicrous comments and fallacious claims made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) regarding a statement of the Organi­sation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). 
In a statement distributed in the UN headquarters on Friday, the OIC reiterated its earlier calls for implementing UNSC resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir, which recognise the right of the Kashmiri people to decide their own future. The OIC General Secretariat reminded India that its Aug 5, 2019, illegal action could not alter the disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir. 

 





 
The Foreign Office spokesperson said in a press release on Sunday that India’s hubris in this regard was deplorable. The spokesperson said the OIC is the largest multilateral forum of Muslim countries representing more than 1.7 billion Muslims and has always been vocal in support of the legitimate rights of the Kashmiri people, who had suffered unspeakably from India’s seven-decades-long illegal occupation and unabated oppression. 
While perpetuating its tyranny and injustice, the spokesperson said India would not succeed in misleading the international community by claiming socio-economic growth and development in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. 
“No amount of repetition would turn a falsehood into truth. In the interest of justice as well as durable peace and security in South Asia, India must honour its commitment to the Kashmiris and to the world community by faithfully implementing the UNSC resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” FO the spokesperson maintained.

4,Arshad Nadeem tears record books to win javelin gold at CWG,"Without his coach and with his elbow heavily taped due to injury, Arshad wins the final with a monster 90.18-metre throw.","BIRMINGHAM: The gold delivered in record-smashing style, a 56-year medal drought in track and field for Pakistan at the Commonwealth Games ended, Arshad Nadeem sank to his knees and prostrated. 
This meant a lot. This was incredible. Against all the odds, without his coach and with his throwing elbow heavily taped due to injury, Arshad won the javelin throw final at the Alexander Stadium with a monster 90.18-metre throw on Sunday evening. 
Achieving that distance in his fifth throw, he came on top in a field that included world champion Anderson Peters, former Olympic champion Keshorn Walcott and former Commonwealth and world champion Julius Yego. 

 





 
That brought Pakistan’s first athletics medal at the Games since 1966 and a first javelin gold for the country, bettering Mohammad Nawaz’s silver at the inaugural edition of the quadrennial multi-sport spectacle in 1954 and Jalal Khan’s second-placed finish in 1958.
It was Pakistan’s second gold in Birmingham and the first was also won with a Games record when Nooh Dasagir Butt triumphed in the +105kg weightlifting competition. 
Like Nooh, Arshad was also one of Pakistan’s leading hopes for a medal going into the Games and he delivered a statement of his intent with just his first throw. 
On an evening when he improved on his personal best thrice, Arshad’s first effort was 86.61 metres. 
He was setting the distance to beat for the rest of the field and it was a question of whether it would be enough for gold. 
A foul on his second attempt didn’t matter as Arshad imp­ro­ved his personal best again with a throw of exactly 88 metres. 
Each effort, however, ended with Arshad grimacing in pain, the 25-year-old immediately reaching out to feel his right elbow, which he’s been nursing after last year’s Tokyo Olympics where he finished fifth. He finished at the same place at last month’s world championships. But in the lead halfway through the final, he could still afford a smile. 
Arshad’s fourth throw landed just beyond the 85-metre mark but with two rounds remaining, he was still in the lead. 
It was in the penultimate round, when Arshad finally trailed — Peters launching the javelin to 88.64 metres. Peters celebrated as if it was enough for gold but his joy was short-lived. This was Arshad’s gold to win and he immediately threw over the sport’s ‘holy grail’ mark of 90m. Doing so he became only the second Asian to cross that mark after Taiwan’s Chao-Tsun Cheng (91.36m). He also broke the Games record of 88.75m by South African Marius Corbett that stood since 1998.  
Peters, who threw over 90 metres to win at the worlds in Oregon, tried with his final throw to overhaul Arshad but it wasn’t to be. He ended with silver with Kenya’s Yego picking up bronze with a best throw of 85.70m. 
10 Sri Lankans missing 
Meanwhile, 10 members of crisis-hit Sri Lanka’s Commonwealth Games contingent in Birmingham disappeared in a suspected attempt to remain in Britain, a top sports official said on Sunday. 
The nine athletes and a manager vanished after completing their events, the Sri Lankan official said, requesting anonymity. 
Three of them — judoka Chamila Dilani, her manager Asela de Silva, and wrestler Shanith Chathuranga — had disappeared last week. 
That prompted a police complaint by the Sri Lankan officials. 
“Since then, another seven have vanished,” the official said, without identifying them. 
“We suspect they want to remain in the UK, possibly to get employment.” 
The 160-strong Sri Lankan contingent’s management possessed the passports of all members to ensure they returned home. 
That failed to deter some from leaving. 
British police located the first three that disappeared, but as they had not violated local laws and held visas valid for six months, no action was taken, the Sri Lankan official said. 
“In fact, the police got us to return the passports that we were holding as a deterrent against defections,” the official said. 
“The police have not told us about their whereabouts.” 
Britain’s West Midlands police force, which covers Birmingham, said it was looking into reports of six Sri Lankans going missing from the Games, and said “inquiries continue to ensure they are safe and well”. 
The force declined to comment further, including on the claim of there being 10 missing people in total, and the UK interior ministry also refused to comment. 
Sri Lanka had won one silver and three bronze medals at the Games as of Sunday evening.
