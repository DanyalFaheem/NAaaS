The MPA said funds were also approved for construction of schools and health facilities in the far-off localities of the district.
“It is first time since the erstwhile tribal area was given the status of a settled district in 2011 that any government has earmarked funds for construction of schools, roads and health facilities in Torghar,” he said.
Mr Khan said the previous Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government had suspended work on the Rs220 million electricity supply schemes, but he added he had moved the Abbottabad Circuit Bench of Peshawar High Court to order release of the funds to complete the schemes.

“After finding no response from the authorities the people of the villages on both sides of the road started its repair on self-help basis,” said Iqbal Khan, an elder of Enzar Shah locality. 
Earlier, elders of the affected areas held a meeting during which they expressed their concern over the authorities’ silence over the issue and decided to start work on the road, said Ajab Khan, a resident of Kohi Shah area. He said two people from every family would participate in the activity. 
The residents flayed the local lawmakers for not taking interest in resolving their problems.

The wild bushes and shrubs not only disturb the natural beauty of Islamabad but also provide potential breeding sites for the growth of dengue larva, so these are being removed on priority, Director General (Environment) Irfan Niazi told APP.
He said during the first phase, CDA teams were removing grass and bushes on main roads, particularly from green belts, median strips, and different marakiz, adding that residential areas and streets would be cleaned at the end. Labour and special grass cutting machines were being used to accomplish the task, he added.
In this regard, special teams were formed, and their performance was being monitored on a daily basis. To a query, he said the plantation drive was also underway and thousands of saplings of local plant species were planted in coordination with the climate change ministry and non-governmental organisations.

The budget speech and finance bill 2022-23 has a contradiction with respect to procedure. 
It is very unfortunate that those who have received an electricity bill of Rs100 have also been sent a tax of Rs3,000. 
Tier 1 category should be maintained for the jewellery sector on the basis of 1,000 square feet.
These views were expressed by Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) President Nadeem Rauf in a meeting with the chairman of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Dr Asim Ahmed. 
Member planning and member customs were also present in the meeting. Former presidents Najam 
Rehan, Raja Aamir Iqbal, Malik Shahid Saleem, representatives from Anjuman Tajran Sheikh Hafeez, 
Fayaz Qureshi, executive member Waseem Riaz and chamber member Khalil Noon were also present in the meeting.
Mr Rauf said that declared property should be exempted from deemed income tax, and notices should be issued to non-filers. 
He added that 17 percent sales tax on bakery products is excessive as these are daily items and there is no luxury on which 17pc is levied, he added.
“We demand that this harassment be stopped. Filers should be given incentives as this will help in documenting the economy,” he said.
Dr Asim assured the delegation that the finance minister is looking into the issue of fixed tax and it is being advertised through newspapers and media that if the tax has been wrongly calculated, it will be adjusted in the future bills. 
The FBR chairman welcomed the proposal of the chamber members related to broadening the tax net and also issued instructions for immediate restoration of Tax Advisory Committees at the regional level.

The martyrs of Karbala, free from worldly interests or greed, laid down their lives in the way of truth. 
These views were expressed by Dr Yousuf Khuskh, chairman of Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) while presenting the keynote address at the ‘Mehfil-i- Musalama’ held in memory of the martyrs of Karbala. The event was presided over by Dr Ehsan Akbar. Ali Akbar Abbass and Anjum Khaliq were the chief guests while Akhtar Usman, Dr Arshad Mahmood Nashad and Shakeel Jazib were the guests of honour. The proceedings were conducted by Arif Farhad.
Dr Khushk said that the events of Karbala drew a boundary between right and wrong, the oppressor and oppressed, and cannot be erased from history.
“On the one hand, this incident exalted the religion of Islam and on the other hand, it determined the lifestyle known as Hussainism. 
“Writers of every genre of literature in Pakistan, whether it is history, poetry, fiction or novel have drawn inspiration from Imam Husain, his sister Bibi Zainab and their companions. From ancient times till today, the story has been used through new angles, new words described using new metaphors. Karbala has widened the scope of literature,” he said, adding the martyrs’ sacrifice is remembered every Muharram.
Dr Ehsan Akbar said: “It is a matter of luck for me to participate in this blessed gathering. Those who honour the martyrs collect a lot of good for themselves and are lucky. Imam Husain’s suffering is the hallmark of our nation and our life.”

9,KP govt planning to set up burn accident prevention authority,"Official says it will be mandatory for buildings to have safe exit, fire extinguishers.","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government is planning to make legislation for establishing a burn accident prevention authority to ensure that the government and private buildings install fire extinguishers and make arrangements for safe exit of the people in case of fire. 
“We are in the process of planning with the lawmakers to make legislation that will pave the way for establishment of an authority and make it mandatory for owners of the buildings such as shopping malls and government and privately-owned buildings to install proper mechanism for putting out fires and ensuring protection of the people,” Prof Tahmeedullah, Director Burns and Plastic Surgery Centre, Hayatabad Medical Complex, told Dawn. 
According to him, three meetings have taken place in this regard and the health department and members of the provincial assembly are keen to pass a law and ensure safety of the people. 
The authority will be established on modern lines covering all aspects, he said. The passage of the law will make it mandatory for the owners of the markets, plazas and officials and private buildings to have smoke detectors and mechanism for exist of the people in case of fire, he said. 

Official says it will be mandatory for buildings to have safe exit, fire extinguishers

Presently, the buildings don’t have such arrangements due to which the people are exposed to burn injuries which entail complications, including mortalities. 
Dr Tahmeed said that women were most vulnerable to burn injuries, especially in domestic cases, adding ratio of male and female victims was 1:3. 
“Women stay in the kitchen in homes and sustain burn injuries due to cylinder blasts and other incidents. We are trying to impart training to nurses in management of burn cases,” he said. 
He said they had signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Khyber Medical University to offer a one-year diploma to nurses in burn injuries after completion of their graduation. He said this would improve the burns care required by female patients. 
“In Pakistan, we have the largest number of 12 female trainee medical officers (TMOs). It is very encouraging for people of the province and women victims of burn injuries,” he said. 
In the last one year, 170,000 patients visited the HMC’s burns centre, two-thirds of whom were women and children, he said. The 120-bed centre, made operational in 2018 with the assistance of US government, has now been fully financed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government. 
“We have got 60 beds for burns patients and as many beds for plastic surgery along with the eight-bed ICU and eight-bed high dependency units, but on the government’s directives we are expanding the services to facilitate people in their home districts,” he said. 
Dr Tahmeed said that three-year’s data of patients at the centre showed that most of them were brought here from Dera Ismail Khan, Tank, Waziristan, Chitral, Abbottabad, Swat and Dir. He said that they were trying to develop facilities in those areas. 
The centre’s director said a 20-bed ward each had been established in Mufti Mehmood Teaching Hospital, DI Khan, and Swat to cater to patients at local level and refer the serious patients to Peshawar. He said in other districts they were establishing burns units in collaboration with the government. 
The centre, he said, was the only facility in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa recognised by the College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan for specialisation of 21 doctors a year. 
“The doctors completing training and qualifying the examinations could be deployed in the district level hospitals as well as in medical teaching institutions to ensure prompt treatment of burn and trauma patients,” he said. 
All patients undergo free operations and diagnostic procedures with the grant provided by the provincial government, he said, adding their centre had also got the services of physiotherapists, psychologists, nutritionists and other experts to ensure rehabilitation of the patients.

The elders from the settled districts of Khyber Pakhunkhwa had approached the jirga of the Uthmanzai tribe and requested them to end their three-week-long protest against the incidence of targeted killing and to reopen the roads and bazaars. The elders, in accordance with the Pakhtun traditions, also presented sheep to the jirga as Nanawati.
In Nanawati, a tenet of the Pakhtunwali, a third party, presents the sheep, which is a way of seeking reconciliation or mediation. According to the local traditions, the Nanawati is always accepted.
Sources said that Bannu commissioner Mohammad Arshad Khan had constituted a 25-member jirga of the elders of Bannu, Lakki Marwat and Wazir Bakkakhel tribe to persuade the elders of Uthmanzai tribe to end the agitation.
The residents of North Waziristan had started the protest movement against the targeted killings with people blocking major roads in the district and closing bazaars. 
Officials said that the Uthmanzai Wazir tribe had accepted the Nanawati and postponed their strike for the next 24 hours.
A jirga member Malik Rab Nawaz told mediapersons that roads would be blocked after 6pm on Monday if the government did not accept their demands. He said that the shutter down strike would also continue in the district. 
Witnesses said dozens of loaded vehicles had been stranded on the Miramshah-Ghulam Khan highway. Trade with Afghanistan via Ghulam Khan border crossing has also been halted due to closure of roads in the district.

13,PHC rejects plea against official holding additional charge of medical college CEO,Rules qualification will be considered when faculty members are appointed for Timergara Medical College.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has dismissed a petition against assigning additional charge of the chief executive officer of newly-established Timergara Medical College (TMC), Lower Dir, and its teaching hospital to an official of the health department by the provincial government. 
A bench of Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar and Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan also turned down the request made in the petition to issue directives to the government to appoint principal/dean/chief executive for TMC and its teaching hospital under the relevant law. 
The petition was jointly filed by two citizens of Lower Dir, Azad Bakht and Bakhtawar Said, seeking directives of the court for the government to withdraw the relevant notifications issued in favour of Dr Shaukat Ali, who is regional director health services, Malakand, and also assigned the additional charge of CEO TMC and its attached teaching hospital. 
They also requested the court to declare as illegal the recruitment process started by the respondent (Dr Shaukat) for the college. 

Rules qualification will be considered when faculty members are appointed for Timergara Medical College

The petitioners’ counsel contended that the inauguration of TMC was held on July 4, 2015, and the District Headquarters Hospital, Timergara, was declared as its teaching hospital on May 18, 2020. 
He argued that Dr Shaukat, who was earlier serving as medical superintendent of the DHQ Hospital, was posted as regional director health services, Malakand, and was also assigned the duty as project director of TMC through a notification on Sept 22, 2021. He stated that the said respondent was then assigned an additional charge of the post of CEO of TMC and DHQ Hospital, Timergara, on Jan 17, 2022. 
He stated that some categories of posts out of the 436 posts, which were created and sanctioned by the provincial government, were advertised and for the screening test the respondent (Dr Shaukat) had hired the services of a testing agency named Hiring Testing Service (HTS), which was against the policy of the provincial government of conducting screening tests through the Education Testing and Evaluation Agency (Etea). 
He argued that the respondent could not be appointed CEO of the medical college as under Regulation No 22 of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council such post could be occupied by the principal having level-III qualification in medical sciences, which the respondent lacked. 
The bench observed that the respondent (Dr Shaukat) was declared to act as project director for the ADP Scheme named “Establishment of Timergara Medical College, Dir Lower” through a notification on July 28, 2017, and he was assigned different tasks through TORs (terms of reference). 
The bench ruled that the record showed that many of the tasks mentioned in the TORs were yet to be completed, including the appointment of employees for the college, and as such the project was yet to be finalised. 
About the qualification required for principal of a medical college, the bench ruled that plain reading of the regulation would show that this rule would only be applicable when the faculty members, including professors, were appointed and then out of them a professor of level-III qualification should be appointed as principal by the competent authority. 
The court observed that establishment of TMC was going through transition period and at this stage such objections of the petitioners could not be legally sustainable. 
About the petitioners’ request to direct the provincial government to appoint principal/dean /chief executive for TMC and DHQ teaching hospital, the bench ruled that such stage of appointment had yet to reach as the principal had to be appointed by the competent authority at the relevant time, therefore, the prayer of the petitioners was premature. 
The bench ruled that the petitioners’ prayer that process of appointments be carried out through testing agency named Etea instead of HTA, would amount to the court’s interference in affairs of the provincial government when it was an entirely administrative decision.

16,Islamia College’s Khyber Union completes 100 years of glory,It was formed to spur students’ creative talent...,"PESHAWAR: Originally named ‘Cunningham Union’, the Khyber Union was formed in 1921-22 for carrying out cultural activities in the Islamia College Peshawar to boost the confidence of its students and spur their creative talent. 
Two decades later, in 1942, a magnificent hall called the Khyber Union Hall was built to create leadership qualities among the learners of this great seat of knowledge. 
The Khyber Union was created to produce leaders with broad vision and global understanding of issues. Earlier, all the activities used to be held in Roos Keppel Hall, but in 1942 another magnificent building, the Khyber Union Hall, was built for the purpose. 
However, during early 60s and 70s the selection of the Khyber Union president got politicised so much so that in 1983 the selection of KU president was abandoned in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ban on the student unions on the campuses. 

It was formed to spur students’ creative talent

The best orator capable of leadership qualities from among the students of the college used to be selected after a tough contest as president of the Khyber Union. According the KU record, Ghulam Haider Khan had served as the first president of Khyber Union for the academic year 1921-22. 
According to the college archives, the union president would enjoy some special perks such as a car with flag besides having his own cabinet members and a lodge in Osmania Hostel where he would entertain guests in three rooms, receive protocol and invite guest leaders and experts for delivering addresses. 
The Khyber Union was created on the pattern of the ‘Oxford Union’, a forum where scholars, political leaders and artists of high repute were invited to share their views on a wide range of topics, while the students also conducted debates on world issues. 
Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah paid his first visit to the Islamia College Peshawar on October 20, 1936, as the President of All-India Muslim League on the invitation of Khyber Union . On his second visit in 1945, the Quaid mobilised students to play their role in the Independence Movement and on the third visit in 1948 he acknowledged the role of Islamians in golden words. 
Masood Jan, 85, a retired officer and old Islamian, quoted his father who was then present on Quaid’s visit as telling him that a student requested the Quaid to change the name of ‘Cunningham Union’ to Khyber Union as he had also changed ‘Cunningham Park’ to Jinnah Park during the same visit, which was immediately accepted. 
About 31 personalities, heads of states and statesmen from 1922 to 2002 had had the privilege to become the life members of Khyber Union owing to its high status. The list includes Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, Reza Shah Pahalvi of Iran, Mrs Eleanor Roosevelt of the US, Jawaharlal Nehru, Mahatma Gandhi, Fatima Jinnah and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. 
Prof Izharullah Izhar, in-charge of the Khyber Union Hall, told this scribe that around 16 different student societies had been holding social, literary and cultural events during the academic session. He said that the students took great interest in such activities.
