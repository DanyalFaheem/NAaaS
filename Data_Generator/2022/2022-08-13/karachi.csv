Syed Mehdi Ali Kazmi, through his lawyer, approached the SHC stating that he was dissatisfied with the investigating officer (IO) of the case for attempting to conclude the probe in favour of the accused by removing key offences without collecting any new evidence. 
The petitioner submitted that his daughter was abducted from his house in Karachi on April 16 and forced for underage marriage in Lahore with main accused Zaheer Ahmed. 
He argued that investigation officer DSP Saeed Rind had filed a final report under Section 173 of the criminal procedure code before the area magistrate without complying with mandatory provisions and also discharged 17 suspects who were earlier prima facie found culpable in the subject crime. 
He maintained that the IO did not even wait for the order of the judicial magistrate on an application filed for the medico-legal examination of the girl and in connivance with the accused removed the offence under Section 375 of the Pakistan Penal Code from the scope of investigation. 
The petitioner said the investigation of the case might be supervised by a DIG not from the Anti-Violent Crime Cell/ CIA to ensure a fair and transparent probe.

2,MUET student dies after donating blood on Jamshoro campus,"The camp set up by health dept immediately closed, probe committee formed by VC...","HYDERABAD/DADU: A first year student of the Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (MUET), Jamshoro, died after donating blood at a camp established on the campus by the provincial health department’s regional blood centre (RBC) on Thursday.
The incident prompted the university administration to immediately wind up the camp. Vice Chancellor Prof Tuaha Hussain Ali has ordered an inquiry into the incident and formed a five-member committee for the purpose.
The RBC had established the blood donation camp on the campus on Thursday with the consent of the MUET administration. A total of 140 students had turned up at the camp and 70 of them — 63 male and seven female — had already donated their blood before the news of one donor, Kuldeep Soothar, having fallen seriously ill spread like a wildfire across the university. Amid panic, the report of his death at the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences hospital followed and the MUET administration ordered immediate winding up of the camp.       

The camp set up by health dept immediately closed, probe committee formed by VC

The VC constituted a committee headed by Dean Faculty of Architecture Dr Khan Mohammad Brohi to hold an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the death of Kuldeep Soothar, a student of the same department. The other members of the committee are the MUET registrar, Dean Faculty of Science Dr Anil Kumar, Dr Pir Mohammad Abro and Adviser Students Affairs Dr Tanveer Hussain. The VC directed that no blood donation camp be established on the campus till further orders. 
It was gathered that Kuldeep, a resident of Diplo town of Tharparkar, had left for Sindh University to attend a short course after donating blood. His condition started deteriorating there and he was rushed to the LUMHS where he died.
Prof Dr Tuaha Hussain Ali, other faculty members and administration officers visited his family members to offer their condolences.
Protest on campus
Students belonging to various nationalist groups and political parties took out a rally from Zero Point to the MUET campus over the death of Kuldeep Soothar. They alleged negligence on the part of the medical staff and organisers of the camp. 
They also claimed that prompt and appropriate treatment was not provided to him at LUMHS hospital.  
Leaders of the protesting students noted that necessary tests were not conducted before allowing students to donate their blood.
They demanded registration of an FIR of the incident and legal action against those found responsible for the student’s death. 
Awami Tehreek (AT) organiser Sajjad Ahmed Chandio and Noor Ahmed Katiar attributed Kuldeep Soothar’s death to negligence on the part of the MUET. 
In a statement issued on Friday, they said the university administration had organised the blood donation camp as a ‘big event’ on the campus. They deplored that the required mandatory tests were not done before collecting blood donation from students and this resulted in the death of Kuldeep Soothar. 
They insisted that it was not an ‘accidental death’, adding that the university administration had now formed a committee to hoodwink people and prove itself innocent in the matter.

3,FIR registered one week after petrol pump manager’s ‘murder’,Woman lawyer’s brother was found dead last Saturday; police were not ready to book ‘influential’ suspects...,"THATTA: A murder case was registered at the Sujawal police station on Thursday night after almost a week of efforts by the bereaved family of Sadaq Rasool Sheikh, who was found dead in the meeting area of the petrol pump, where he was serving as manager, last Saturday. 
The bereaved family, led by Mr Sheikh’s sister, Advocate Kanwal Sheikh, had been making relentless efforts to get the case registered but the area police appeared reluctant to oblige them as, according to her, the suspects were backed by highly influential political figures of Thatta and Sujawal districts.  
On Wednesday, a large number of area people along with the heirs and their relatives assembled at the police station and raised slogans against apathy of the police. Advocate Kanwal Sheikh held hours-long debates with different police officers and also approached their high-ups over phone in her attempt to persuade the Sujawal SHO to register the FIR but in vain.

SI Mushtaq Ahmed along with some officers and personnel drove to the site and threatened to use force if they did not end the protest and clear the road. However, the protesters refused to disperse and insisted that the FIR be registered as per the desire of the bereaved family. 
The Sindh Bar Council in a statement condemned the police apathy in the matter and expressed sympathy its woman member over the death of her brother. It deplored the attitude of Sujawal police with the bereaved family. The Sujawal Shehri Ittahad also announced its plan to launch a protest drive over the alleged murder of Sadaq Rasool Sheikh.

Riaz’s nephew Hussain Aziz was picked up by plain-clothed personnel late on Thursday night from London Town in Qasimabad when he was sitting at a hotel but let him go after people offered resistance. 
One of the men in civvies introduced himself as A.K. Zardari, a sub-inspector at Qasimabad police station, and said that he was performing official duties by detaining Aziz though he freed him over peoples’ reaction, said party sources.
But later on he was picked up at gunpoint near Jamali Para in Qasimabad phase-II by the same group of men when he was returning home. 
JSM claimed that he was shoved into a police mobile, intimidated and threatened. Before letting him go, his tormentors gave him a message that he should inform Riaz Chandio to ‘behave’, said the press release.
The JSM, which met here with Riaz Chandio in the chair, said that video footage of the incident had been shared with police authorities, including DIG and SSP Hyderabad. 
Riaz said that he was told on Friday by SSP that Zardari was an informer of police and that Riaz could lodge an FIR against him. 
He wondered who were those seven men accompanying Zardari and why they had not been arrested yet.

7,PTI to file Imran’s papers on three NA seats today,"The three constituencies are NA-237 in district Malir, NA-239 in district Korangi and NA-246 (Lyari) in Karachi.","KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf will file nomination papers of former prime minister Imran Khan from three Karachi National Assembly seats, which fell vacant after acceptance of resignations of MNAs belonging to the opposition party.
Speaking at a press conference, former federal minister and Sindh chief of the PTI Ali Zaidi said that the nomination papers for the by-elections would be filed before the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) office in Karachi.
The three constituencies are NA-237 in district Malir, NA-239 in district Korangi and NA-246 (Lyari) in district South.
“The by-elections will once again prove the love of Karachi and its people for Imran Khan,” he said. “The PTI will launch an aggressive election campaign and we are very much hopeful that Khan sahib [PTI chairman] would also visit Karachi very soon.”
He accused the Sindh government of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of rigging the first phase of the local government elections in Sindh.
Mr Zaidi warned the ruling party against using government machinery to rig the Aug 28 LG polls in Karachi and Hyderabad. 
He also demanded a transparent role of the ECP, which he said “failed” to hold free and fair LG elections in the first phase in 14 districts of Sindh.
He also criticised the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan for staying silent on different issues which it always raised while being in the coalition with the PTI. 
He said the population census had always been a key issue of the MQM-P, but it did not say a word when the current government delayed the census process for months. “The people of Karachi are well aware and they will give their verdict in the coming polls,” he said.

8,PPP withdraws from NA-245 contest in favour of rival MQM-P,By-poll on seat vacant after Aamir Liaquat’s demise scheduled for Aug 21.,"KARACHI: In line with a joint strategy of the ruling coalition partners at the Centre, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) on Friday announced withdrawing from the August 21 by-poll on a Karachi National Assembly seat, NA-245, to support the candidate of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P). 
The PPP’s decision has left the MQM’s candidate as the main contestant against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which had won the National Assembly seat in 2018 general elections. 
The NA-245 seat had fallen vacant after the death of PTI MNA Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain. 
The Election Commission of Pakistan, which had earlier announced that it was organising the by-poll on the vacant seat on July 27, issued a new schedule last month and fixed August 21 as the new date of polling. 

By-poll on seat vacant after Aamir Liaquat’s demise scheduled for Aug 21

All major parties contesting the elections had met all the formalities before the new schedule was announced by the ECP. 
The PPP said the decision to withdraw its candidate in favour of the MQM-P’s was in fact the decision of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — an alliance of all the parties in the coalition government. 
However, it made it clear that the strategy was opted only for the by-polls across the country. 
“It is a consensus decision of the parties in the coalition [in the federal government] that whichever party had won or stood second in the general elections would be supported by other parties in by-elections,” Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani, who is also the PPP’s Karachi chapter president, said in a statement. 
“So we are very clear to follow the rules set by the parties with better vision for the future democratic course and we in line with this strategy have decided to withdraw our candidate Danish Khan from the NA-245 to support the MQM-P.” 
The PPP candidate, Mr Khan, who joined the party only a month ago and had become the candidate for the National Assembly seat has endorsed the statement of Mr Ghani who’s also the PPP Karachi president. 
The MQM-P and PPP had signed a Charter of Rights in March. Both the parties are part of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif-led federal government, but in the province the MQM-P sits on the opposition benches in the Sindh Assembly.
MQM-P and PTI emerge as key contestants 
After the fresh announcement from the PPP, the MQM-P and the PTI have emerged as key contestants in the NA-245. 
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had already withdrawn its candidate to support the MQM-P, though the party hardly enjoys any vote bank in the constituency. 
With the history of winning the seat for the past many general elections except in 2018 when it lost the seat to PTI’s Aamir Liaquat, the MQM-P has fielded Moeed Anwar as the candidate for the NA-245 seat. Mr Anwar was elected as District Municipal Corporation-East chairman in 2016 local government elections. 
Dr Farooq Sattar factor 
Enjoying strong position in the constituency after support from different parties, the MQM-P, however, faces a new challenge as its disgruntled leader, seasoned parliamentarian and founder of the Organisation Restoration Committee of the MQM-P Dr Farooq Sattar is also contesting as an independent candidate. 
Addressing a news conference last month, Dr Sattar announced that he would contest from NA-245 after negotiations had failed with the MQM-P’s coordination committee, particularly convenor Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui. 
He said the negotiations had failed because the MQM-P had refused his suggestion to convene a workers’ convention where the workers could devise a strategy for the reunification process.

KARACHI: A group show titled Saahil Ki Kahanian (Stories from the coast) opened at the Koel Art Gallery on Friday evening. Curated by eminent artist Noorjehan Bilgrami, the exhibition is a result of collaboration between the gallery and the British Council.
In all, eights artists — individuals and in pairs or groups — are taking part in the display: Mahera Omar, Marvi Mazhar, Abuzar Madhu and Swalay Muhammad; Taqi Shaheen and Sara Khan Pathan; Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Janan Sindhu.
The objective of the whole exercise is to raise awareness of the effects of climate change in the coastal areas of the country. In doing so, the project has awarded grants to the Pakistani artists who have explored the subject through a variety of mediums such as film, music, illustrations, photography, textiles and crafts. 

Show aims at raising awareness of climate change effects in country’s coastal areas

There was a buzz on Friday around the art space where the artists, their admirers and the media started to gather from 5pm. The lovely images of the coastline and visuals representing the subject in relation to maritime life with catchy captions such as ‘field notes from where the salt meets the sweet water’ and ‘kabhi aisey bhi hota hai kinare doob jate hain’ instantly attracted their attention.
Talking to Dawn, Ms Bilgrami said, “I was approached by the British Council to curate an exhibition in connection with the 75th anniversary of Pakistan’s independence. Since I live in this city, I’ve always been drawn to the coast of Karachi, and having previously done a project on mangroves, I thought it’s a great opportunity to do a larger interactive event and get more people involved. So the idea for Saahil Ki Kahanian came about.
“We thought to make it open-ended. They wanted to give out grants [as well] so it was put out to individuals and organisations to come up with some ideas and concepts of how they would interpret something that could benefit the fishermen community and the coast at large.

“Forty-two organisations and individuals applied. It was difficult to shortlist because of the really good projects. The selection committee selected the artists whose work is on view. My role was to work with them and guide them in order to find a common ground. But they were totally independent and carried out [work] on their own,” she said.
Mahera Omar, a film-maker, has worked individually by recording the mangroves; Marvi Mazhar, Abuzar Madhu and Swalay Muhammad’s effort called ‘Milaap’ is a conversation between the river and the sea; Taqi Shaheen and Sara Khan have developed a board game-like concept, ‘The shape of island’, to use the game as a storytelling tool for reflection and ecological understanding about scarcity of natural resources around Bhit Island; and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who has paired up with another film-maker Janan Sindhu, focuses on the plight of blind dolphins.
Mr Bhutto said, “The show has incredible artists focused on coastal ecologies of Pakistan. My collaboration is with Janan Sindhu. Both of us are working on Indus river dolphins which are a species that can only be found in Pakistan. We are working in particular with a man called Nazir Mirani. He has been a dolphin conservator for the past 55 years. A lot of the exhibits you will see here is about him and his family.”
He added that the dolphins are an endangered species mainly because of the water shortage issues that surfaced in the last decade. “The survival of the species indicates the health and survival of our own river. If the species population is healthy, it means our river is also healthy.” 
The exhibition concludes on Aug 19.

A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha also issued notices to the interior secretary, director general-FIA, deputy director FIA-Karachi and the deputy attorney general for the next hearing.
Former Sindh governor Imran Ismail and MPA Dr Seema Zia, through their counsel, petitioned the SHC impugning the call-up notices issued by the FIA on Aug 5 in connection with an enquiry into alleged mismanagement of party funds.

SHC issues notices on PTI leaders’ plea against FIA probe into prohibited funding case

The petitioners’ lawyer argued that the impugned notices were issued pursuant to the Aug 2 order of the Election Commission of Pakistan in the PTI’s prohibited funding case.
He stated that the ECP had not referred the matter to the FIA and the notices were issued without jurisdiction only to harass and humiliate the petitioners.
The counsel has placed reliance on an order of the Peshawar High Court passed on Aug 11 in a writ petition filed by former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser in an identical matter and pleaded to issue a restraining order for the FIA not to take any coercive action against the petitioners.
“Be that as it may, let notices be issued to the respondents as well as DAG for 24.09.2022. Meanwhile, FIA may continue enquiry, however, no adverse action pursuant to the notices stated above be taken against the petitioners till the next date of hearing,” the bench in its order said.
Both PTI leaders in their petition submitted that their party was singled out despite orders passed by the Islamabad High Court for hearing and concluding pending matters related to other political parties.
They were of the view that the order passed by the ECP was a fact-finding report that required other proceedings to be initiated by issuing a show-cause notice and it cannot be considered as the final conclusion of the ECP.
They submitted that the ECP never called any regional wing including the Sindh chapter of the PTI or any other allied mother wing or office-bearers and maintained that the bank accounts opened and maintained by local office-bearers of regional/provincial wing of the PTI were never used for foreign funding or prohibited funding rather the central party through cross cheques transferred certain amounts for expenditure to the provincial wing, which was a matter of record.
They alleged that they were going to be victimised politically by using agencies as a tool to pressurise political rivals and pleaded to set aside the impugned call-up notices.

Abdul Nasir, Adil Khan and Mehmood Khalil were booked for physically assaulting Sana Akram over a petty dispute within the jurisdiction of the Sharea Faisal police station.
The video of the incident went viral on social media prompting Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah to direct the city police chief to arrest the person who attacked the innocent woman.
District and Sessions Judge (East) granted the trio bail against a surety of Rs30,000 each with direction to cooperate with the police during the investigation.
The matter was fixed for Aug 16 for confirmation or otherwise of their interim bail.
In the FIR, complainant Sana had stated that she worked as a domestic help at a flat in an apartment complex. She said on the night of Aug 5, her son Sohail, had come at the reception of the complex to give her food but Abdul Nasir, Adil Khan, Mehmood Khalil and others of the flat union did not allow him to go to the flat. When she came downstairs and asked as to why they were not allowing her son, Adil started using swear words and asked security guard Daud to beat her. The guard slapped her and kicked her.
The applicant had stated that she was five to six months pregnant and felt pain and became unconscious due to beating.
A case was registered under Sections 337 (Shajjah), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of the victim.
