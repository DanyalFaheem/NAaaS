0,Police barred from harassing PML-N leaders,"Judge issues notices to Punjab govt and police, summons record of the cases registered against the petitioners.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Friday restrained the police from causing harassment to PML-N leaders Attaullah Tarar, Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan and Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan.
Justice Safdar Saleem Shahid passed the order on a joint petition filed by the three politicians through Advocate Rana Asadullah Khan.
The judge issued notices to the Punjab government and police, besides summoning record of the cases registered against the petitioners.
Earlier, their counsel argued before the court that the police at the behest of the provincial government and out of political 
vendetta, were causing harassment to the petitioners as raids were being conducted on their residences.
He alleged that the police were bent upon arresting the petitioners in fake and politically-motivated cases.  
He asked the court to restrain the respondents from harassing the petitioners and their families. He further asked the court to summon details of the cases, if any, registered against the petitioners and also restrained police from arresting them.
The judge heard the petition in the chamber and sought para-wise comments from the chief secretary and police on the next hearing to be fixed later.
“Meanwhile, no illegal measures shall be taken against the petitioners,” the judge said in his order.

1,"Alvi offers to mediate between Shehbaz, Imran to reduce tension","Stresses need to initiate a consultative process, says army should not be dragged into politics","LAHORE: President Dr Arif Alvi on Friday called upon political parties to refrain from bringing the Pakistan Army into political discourse, saying the military was the guarantor of national security and “it should not be made controversial”.
The president’s statement comes days after PTI leader Shahbaz Gill was arrested by the Islamabad police on charges of sedition and inciting the public against the state institutions, following his controversial remarks about the armed forces on a news channel. 
Speaking to the media at the Governor House, Dr Alvi said that there was a need to initiate a “consultative process” to bring all the important stakeholders of the country to a negotiation table, reports Dawn.com. 
“However, the constitutional role of a president does not allow him to officially reach out to the stakeholders.” 

Stresses need to initiate a consultative process, says army should not be dragged into politics

Dr Alvi stated that it was the primary responsibility of the government, opposition, and all the other relevant institutions to deliberate upon defusing the rising polarisation in the country.
He said political parties and stakeholders needed to sit together and chalk out a way forward, especially with regard to holding free and fair elections and developing a charter of economy that could help ease out the current political and economic situation. 
“Everyone will have to think about the situation we are currently embroiled into.”  
The president also offered to mediate between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PTI Chairman Imran Khan “for the sake of the country”. 
“It will be my endeavour to reduce tensions between the two leaders and make the environment feasible for early elections.” 
Dr Alvi stressed that a conflict between the federal government and provinces was unfavourable for the country, stressing that it should be settled. 
He said he had been “reminding all the stakeholders that the things are not right”. 
The president went on to say that he had also been informing Imran about the management issues in Pakistan, adding that “he had his own viewpoint over the matter.” 
He also stressed that stakeholders within Pakistan should only be involved in hammering out issues confronting the country without any involvement of any foreign persons or a country. 
During the talk, the president insisted that he had a very cordial relationship with the incumbent government, saying he accorded timely approval to all summaries sent by PM Shehbaz, except for four which were delayed. 
He also revealed that he held more discussions with the incumbent prime minister as compared to Imran. 
Separately, the president highlighted corruption as “a major reason for the backwardness of any country”. 
“One of the best ways to counter corruption is to make all financial transactions through formal banking channels, especially when it comes to political parties while receiving and managing donations,” he suggested. 
Dr Alvi opined that 90 per cent of social media was “good” as “it provides huge chunk of information and we should learn to deal with the remaining 10pc by filtering out fake news and hearsay”. 
EVM: The president said he was the main proponent of electronic voting machines since long even during the governments of the PPP and the PML-N. 
“It was me who convinced the PTI for the use of technology during elections. The EVM provides extremely simple solutions to conduct free and fair elections.” 
He emphasised the need for consensus on the use of the technology during the election process which, he said, would strengthen the democratic process in the country. 
While commenting on the government talks with the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, he said he was of the opinion that any such negotiations should be mandated by the parliament and they ought to be pursued in confidence to reach some amicable outcome. 
“The result should be reported back to the parliament before making them public,” he said. 
Dr Alvi said he respected all institutions being the head of the state. 
He said he also agreed with the remarks of the chief justice when he had said there should be a standard for appointment of judges in the judiciary.

3,Ahmadi man stabbed to death at Chenabnagar,LAHORE: A 60-year-old Ahmadi was stabbed to death over ‘religious differences’ at Chenabnagar on Friday....,"LAHORE: A 60-year-old Ahmadi was stabbed to death over ‘religious differences’ at Chenabnagar on Friday.  
Police said Naseer Ahmad and his brother Munir were going for shopping in the morning when an unidentified man, who was standing at the Chenabnagar bus stand, stopped them and asked them questions about their religion. Ahmad told the man who carried a bag that they belonged to the Ahmadiyya community, police said, adding the suspect pulled out a dagger from his bag and attacked Ahmad. He died on the spot.  
Police said the locals gathered and nabbed the suspect who tried to flee, and handed him over to the law enforcers.  
The deceased, who belonged to Darul Rehmat Sharqi near Chenabnagar (Rabwah), has left behind a widow and three daughters to mourn.  
Police shifted the body to morgue for autopsy and registered a murder case against the suspect who was identified as Hafiz Shahzad Hasan Sialvi, a resident of Sargodha’s Sillanwali area. The suspect graduated from Madrassa Anwar-ul-Quran in the area of Muhammadwala police station in 2010.  
Victim’s brother Munir told Dawn that the suspect had attacked them on religious grounds and was chanting slogans in favour of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP). He said the suspect also raised slogans eulogising TLP founder, the late Khadim Hussain Rizvi. Munir demanded action against the people inciting religious hatred in the country.  
Expressing concern and grief over the brutal murder, Ahmadiyya community spokesperson Saleemuddin said the murder of an Ahmadi in broad daylight at the hands of a religious fanatic was extremely worrisome. He said the population of Rabwah consisted of 95 per cent of Ahmadis and they were not safe.  
Chiniot District Police Officer Asadur Rehman told Dawn that the suspect was arrested and the weapon had been recovered. He said a police team led by DSP Zulfiqar had been constituted to know the cause behind the killing. He said police would investigate the matter keeping in view all possibilities.

4,"Protest against AstroTurf removal: PTI workers heckle former hockey stars, media",Olympian Tariq Aziz says he is disappointed over the government’s decision to allow a political gathering at the stadium.,"LAHORE: Workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Friday raised slogans against former hockey stars who gathered at the National Hockey Stadium (NHS) to protest against removal of the AstroTurf to hold a public rally on Saturday (tomorrow).  
Dr Tariq Aziz, who represented the Pakistan team which won the gold medal in the Mexico Olympics in 1968 and silver medal in Tokyo Olympics, was prominent among the protesters. As the hockey players entered the stadium, a number of PTI workers who were already there to make arrangements for the event raised slogans against them. 
Two former international players, retired Col Abdul Rauf Sindhu and retired Maj Pirzada, along with some hockey lovers, continued their protest. 
They displayed the posters inscribed with slogans demanding that the stadium should not be destroyed, a new turf be laid and efforts be made to save hockey. 
Olympian Tariq Aziz told Dawn that he was disappointed over the government’s decision to allow a political gathering at the stadium despite the fact that there were many open places which could be used to hold such rallies. He said the attitude of the political party workers was unfair as the hockey lovers had the right to protest against any decision detrimental to the game.  
He said Imran Khan as a sportsman should promote sports instead of destroying the grounds. As a former hockey player, Aziz said, it was his duty to highlight such an action as he had no link with any political party and he was raising the issue solely out of his love for hockey and for its future.  
“Our aim is to save hockey as the game has given us respect and pride,” he said. 
Retired Col Abdul Rauf said although the government claimed that a new turf would be laid, it was not an easy job as it would take at least one year and the players would be deprived of a world-class venue until that time. He condemned the attitude of the political party’s workers. 
Pirzada also expressed his concern over the government’s move and made it clear that the protest was being registered without any political motive.  
Meanwhile, during the media talk, the party workers continued to heckle the event while raising the volume of the sound system through which some of them delivered ‘hate speeches’ against the protesters.  
The PTI -- the ruling party in Punjab -- shifted the public rally from Islamabad to Lahore a few days ago and selected the hockey stadium as the venue. It is the first time a political event is being held at the NHS which hosted World Cup-1990, Champions Trophy in 1988, 1994, 1998 and 2004, besides many other international events.

6,Lahore – city of stories and traditions,"“Lahore is history, culture, home. Anyone who writes or expresses views about Lahore will have a different...","“Lahore is history, culture, home. Anyone who writes or expresses views about Lahore will have a different experience to share. My primary interest is in the Walled City because every time you go there you find something new. The more you read, the more you’re fascinated by the area. No amount of pictures can justify that ambiance and life”, is how Dr Mehreen Hasan feels about the city that became a home away from home, and one that she’s captured through her lens over the years. 
Photographer by passion and cardiologist by profession, Dr Hasan has now put together some of her best photographs depicting the vibrant life, captivating history and rich culture of Lahore in the form of a coffee table book -- Lahore by Heart -- which was launched in June and is now available at bookstores and online. 
Multan-born Dr Hasan has been in Lahore since her graduation from the Allama Iqbal Medical College in the late 90s, and has been associated with the Punjab Institute of Cardiology for 15 years. Though she’s been pursuing photography as a hobby for as long as she can remember, the idea of a book popped up a couple of years ago only. 
“Photography runs in my genes because both my father and grandfather were passionate about it; they developed photos back in the days themselves in those darkrooms. So that inspired me. My DSLR was always with me whenever I would take guests to show around Lahore. I remember upgrading from a point-to-shoot to a DSLR around 2008-09. After that it was just self-learning through tutorials and videos online,” she tells Dawn. 
After having clicked thousands of pictures of various corners and monuments of the city, someone suggested she compile them into a book. And it was in 2019 that Dr Hasan grabbed  
her camera again and set out to her favourite part of Lahore: the Walled City. That way, she ended up capturing the area before, during and after renovation of some of its streets. 
Later, when the Covid pandemic hit, and she got a little break from the hospital, she sat down, selected from thousands of pictures she’d taken and then started reading about those places and their history. 
“I was most interested in the Walled City because every time you go there you find something new. When I started compiling the book, I read up a lot about the places I clicked and their history. The more you read, the more you’re fascinated. During Eid Miladun Nabi it’s decorated so beautifully that no amount of pictures can justify that ambiance. I couldn’t pay attention to the rest of the city because the Walled City only consumes you, especially Wazir Khan mosque that I’ve covered from almost all angles,” says Dr Hasan, explaining why her book primarily contains pictures from the old part of the city. 
She says through her 128-page book she wants to create awareness among those dwellers of the city who haven’t seen much of it despite living here. “I want to make people aware of the beautiful architecture and culture of the city that they don’t go and visit. Foreigners come and explore the city, but its own citizens don’t. Every corner, every street is fascinating.”
She’s aware that it’s just the tip of the Lahori ‘iceberg’ she’s touched through her book, but has come out of the area with a newfound fondness for the locals. “Only 10-20 per cent has been touched. Everybody has a different aspect of Lahore; everybody sees it in a different way. More than the monuments, what’s fascinating is the locals you encounter who tell you their history, how and when they settled in an area, the history of their own house and how it’s been transformed. This interaction with people is amazing; they’re so friendly and forthcoming. When I went to cover Eid Miladun Nabi, people were so hospitable that they would invite me over to their houses, offer halwa puri or whatever they’d be cooking. You won’t find such hospitality in places like DHA.” 
In the next two years, Dr Hasan plans to launch another such book covering other areas of Lahore. “I couldn’t cover The Mall because you need permissions for certain buildings. So I will sort that out and then work on another book.”

9,PTV legend Leghari looks to govt for theatre’s revival,"LAHORE: One of the finest actors of Pakistan who graced a number of television plays during the golden era of PTV,...","LAHORE: One of the finest actors of Pakistan who graced a number of television plays during the golden era of PTV, Aurangzeb Leghari, says if the government provides any patronage to message-oriented and socially relevant plays, quality theatre can be revived. 
Mr Leghari in an interview with Dawn not only threw light on the prevalent situation of television plays but also recalled the days when he used to do theatre back in the 60s at Alhamra and how good were the plays, the direction and the scripts in those days. 
He said that amidst this overwhelming commercial theatre wave topped with dare bare dances and vulgarity, only the patronisation of the government could lead to quality theatre revival. Leghari is also the chairman of the Pakistan Artistes Equity. 
“If the Punjab government patronises quality theatre and the finance division allocates funds for decent morally up to the mark theatre, things could change as many artistes from the Equity could be asked to be part of such kind of theatre,”  he said. 
Leghari was born on Oct 25,1944, in Rahimabad, Rahim Yar Khan. He studied at the Government Central Model School, Lahore, later got admission to the Cadet College of Pataro and did graduation from the Government College Lahore.
In the early 60s, Leghari started his acting career by taking part in plays staged at the Government College, Lahore. He acted in a play in ‘Sawan Ren Da Sufna’, the Punjabi translation of Shakespeare’s ‘Mid Summer Night Dream’. The play was translated by Sufi Gulam Mustafa Tabassum.  
He then started doing theatre at Alhamra with the likes of Anwar Sajjad, Kavi Khan, Firdous Jamal and other leading actors. 
“I did a play at Alhamra during the war of 1965 ‘Lahoo Kay Charagh’, said Leghari saying all the actors did that play with great fervour and passion.
He said in the early 60s, theatre used to be nice and decent with thought-provoking message-oriented scripts; there were no dances and below-the-belt vulgar dialogues in the plays. 
He performed in over 300 theatrical plays. “We used to sell tickets of our plays by ourselves while standing on The Mall; the ticket price used to be Rs5,” he recalled.  
His first TV play was ‘Samjohta’ but before stepping into TV plays, he hosted television shows and also used to read the weather report. His memorable TV plays include Waris, Dehleez, Waqat, Hazaroon Rastay, Faraib, Uchay Burj Lahore Dey, Tali Thalay, Chanan Tey Dariya and many others. 
He also assisted many film directors, such as Farid W Ahmed and S Suleman, though he acted only in one movie, Naureen. 
Leghari, besides being a fellow from the world of performing arts, is also a philanthropist; he is one of the directors of an orphanage named Asra where orphan children are also given modern education. 
To this question about his experience of working in the Karachi showbiz industry, Leghari said the experience was not that good. “Perhaps, there is a need to work in harmony. An artist is an artist, so every artist should be given due respect and space,” he said.
He said there was a decline in the film industry in Punjab because the directors of their times did not produce their students. Good scripts and great direction were needed to produce good films as formula films won’t do any good.

The CM ordered early completion of the project and announced to upgrade it to the status of Fatima Jinnah Dental University.
Mr Elahi said the scheme was approved in his previous tenure in 2005, but the PML-N government made no significant progress on it. Like other public welfare schemes, he said, this project also became a victim of political enmity.  
He said the project could not be made functional despite a lapse of 17 years (including three-and-a-half years of PTI governments in centre and Punjab), adding that the delay resulted in increasing the construction cost.  
He said the failure in timely completion of healthcare schemes was criminal negligence. He added that if completed as per 
the schedule, the project would have resulted in provision of quality healthcare facilities to the people.  
He directed the officials of communication and works department and NesPak to complete the project without any further delay.  
“It is my mission to provide quality healthcare facilities at the doorstep of the masses and the Fatima Jinnah Dental University will provide modern treatment facilities to the patients,” he said.
Earlier, the health secretary gave a briefing on the project details.
CONCESSIONAL PACKAGE: Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi on Friday announced a concessional package for women and students on Orange Line Metro Train, while elderly citizens and differently-able persons would be allowed free travel.

14,Restoration work starts on damaged rail track,Red alert issued for possible flood in next 48 hours,"NAROWAL: The Pakistan Railways has started restoration work on the  railway track that was washed away by the flood in the rainwater drain  Dek while the Narowal district administration has again issued a red  alert in view of the possible flood in the next 48 hours.   
Relief operation of Rescue 1122 is going on in flood-affected areas of district Sialkot.   
A high-level flood passed through the Dek coming from India-held  Kashmir, making the drain overflow. The floodwater swept away the  railway track between Ahmedabad and Pasrur railway stations on the  Narowal-Sialkot section, suspending the movement of trains.   
The railways started the repair and maintenance work of the  damaged track. A team of engineers and workers has started working on  the section of the damaged track. According to the sources in the  railways, traffic would be restored on the Narowal-Sialkot section on  Saturday (today).   

Red alert issued for possible flood in next 48 hours   

“We have plugged the10-foot deep breach at around 60-foot long  piece of the rail track that was washed away on Thursday owing to  torrential rains in India-held Kashmir,” PR Chief Executive Officer  Farrukh Taimur Gilzai told Dawn.  
He said Allama Iqbal Express (9-Up/10Down) and Lasani Express  (125Up/126 Down) would not go beyond Narowal instead of going to Sialkot  due to the breaches near Pasrur Station.  
“Two trains – Faiz Ahmed Faiz (209-Up/210Down) and Narowal  passenger (211-Up / 212-Down) – are running between Lahore and Narowal.  It is hoped that traffic will be restored on Saturday, subject to  completion of the work and no rains or flooding in the area,” he added.  
In Sialkot, according to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Muhammad  Waseem, rescue operations are being carried out for the residents of the  flood-affected villages near nullah Dek. The people trapped in the  flood in Klaswala and other surrounding villages are being shifted to  safer places. 
Narowal District Emergency Officer Naeem Akhtar said the district  administration had dispatched the Rescue 1122 to Chandianwala to deal  with the possible flood in the Ravi river while rescue posts had been  established at Kot Nainan. 
“There is a low-level flood in the river Ravi  and rainwater drains of Dek, Bein and Oaj in the Narowal district,” he  added.   
According to the irrigation department sources, Dek, which had a  flow of 31,500 cusecs of water on Thursday, was reduced to only 2,500  cusecs on Friday. They claimed that the floodwater in the surrounding  villages as well as the fields would be cleared within the next 36  hours. In Sialkot, the water level in the Chenab river at Head Marala  has come down to 80,000 cusecs.  
Narowal Deputy Commissioner Shahid Farid visited the rainwater  drains and embankments of the Ravi river and reviewed the arrangements  made to deal with the possible floods.

The facility was developed in 2000 alongside the rail track by the then assistant commissioner, Naseem Sadiq, and was named Teku Park in the memory of Sikh leader Tek Singh who served the rail passengers for a long time by providing them drinking water in the 18th century as the subsoil water of the area was brackish. Historians say he would fetch water from Teku canal several kilometres away from the city.  
During the last 22 years the Municipal Committee could not take proper care of the park and its costly swings installed for children, gates and grassy grounds were ruined. Recently citizens informed Deputy Commissioner Zahid Suhail that unkempt bushes provided a shelter to the criminals and addicts and that the jogging track for visitors and recreational facilities for children could be restored.  
The DC deputed MC staff to restore and renovate the park. An official said the park had almost been restored and the remaining work would be completed within a week after which it would be opened for the citizens.
