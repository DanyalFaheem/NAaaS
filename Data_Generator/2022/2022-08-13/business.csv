0,Discos allowed Rs9.9 tariff hike for June,Data showed Discos fuel cost increased by about Rs133 billion in June.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Friday notified ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) to charge Rs9.90 per unit additional fuel cost adjustment (FCA) on electricity they sold in June to collect an extra Rs132 billion during August.
The regulator said in a notification that it “has reviewed and assessed an increase of Rs9.8972 per kWh (kilowatt-hour) in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variation in the fuel charges for June”.
The notification added that the additional FCA will apply to all consumer categories except lifeline consumers and will be shown separately in the consumers’ bills based on units billed to the consumers in June and reflected in August bills.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) — a subsidiary of the Power Division — on behalf of Discos had filed a petition for a record Rs9.91 per unit additional monthly FCA but Nepra approved Rs9.90, which is almost 166pc higher than the reference fuel cost charged to consumers in June. It is also an unprecedented mismatch between estimated and actual fuel costs.
Data showed that despite 52pc power generation from cheaper domestic resources with static prices, Discos fuel cost increased by about Rs133bn in June. 
The CPPA claimed that the consumers were charged by Discos a reference fuel cost of Rs5.93 per unit in June, but the actual cost turned out to be Rs15.84 per unit, hence an additional charge of about Rs9.91 per unit to consumers. Nepra determined the actual fuel cost at Rs15.83 per unit.
The share of domestic fuel sources in overall power generation was slightly lower at 52pc in June compared to 54pc in May and better than 50pc in April and 45pc in March. The share of hydropower supply in the overall basket stood almost unchanged at more than 24pc as in May. Hydropower has no fuel cost.
The share of nuclear power almost dropped by 50pc to 9pc in June from 13pc in May and 17.37pc in April because of the closure of 1,100MW K-2 for re-fuelling.
As a result, the biggest contribution of over 24.43pc in overall power supply came from imported RLNG-based power plants, partly at very expensive rates, and its share was nominally higher than 23pc in May. The share of domestic gas in power generation increased to almost 11pc in June against 10pc in May and April.
The share of coal-based power plants was almost unchanged at 13.6pc in June and May but was significantly lower than 16.74pc in April and 25pc in March because of low coal stocks amid financial limitations of power producers and higher global prices. In January and February, coal-based generation had contributed 33pc and 32pc to the overall power supply.

2,Maersk suspends C&F bookings from Pakistan,Blames the “restrictions/limitations” imposed by SBP on outward freight remittances.,"KARACHI:  International logistics company Maersk told its Pakistani clients on  Friday it’s going to “temporarily suspend” the acceptance of C&F  bookings — contracts in which freight is prepaid — with effect from  Aug 15.
A C&F contract covers both cost and freight as the  seller is required to arrange for the carriage of goods by sea to a port  of destination.
Maersk blamed the “restrictions/limitations”  imposed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on outward freight  remittances for putting the freight services provider in a “very  difficult situation”.
The company said it’ll keep the acceptance  of C&F bookings suspended until remittances restrictions are either  eased or lifted by the SBP.
The company noted that it’ll continue  accepting export bookings on the basis of FOB (freight collect), which  stipulates that the buyer owns the products en route to its warehouse  and must pay any delivery charges. The SBP’s move is apparently aimed at  restricting the outflow of dollars. The quick depletion of the dollars  has brought the local currency under pressure, leaving the country  scrambling for greenback supplies from international lenders and  friendly countries.

4,Credit offtake surges fourfold  in July-December: SBP report,"Exports grew considerably in the first half, notwithstanding some deceleration in the second quarter.","KARACHI:  The private sector credit grew nearly fourfold year-on-year  in the first six months (July-December) of the previous fiscal year, the State Bank of Pakistan said in its half-yearly report on the state of Pakistan’s economy on Friday.
The report said this was mainly on the  back of working capital requirements that rose due to increased domestic  demand, higher exports, as well as the global commodity price hike and an ensuing jump in domestic wholesale prices during July-December 2021-22. 
The  report noted that soaring global commodity prices, coupled with growing  domestic demand, especially for industrial inputs, resulted in a  widening of the current account deficit, despite double-digit growth in  workers’ remittances to $15.8 billion in 1HFY22. 
Exports grew considerably in the first half, notwithstanding some deceleration in  the second quarter. Both higher unit prices and export volumes contributed to export growth with a $3.4bn year-on-year increase  in 1HFY22 to  $15.2bn — “which is highest-ever half-yearly export  out-turn”, said the report.  
“However, despite slightly slower  import momentum in the second quarter, the increase in 1HFY22 imports  was nearly four times the increase in exports,” said the report.  
Besides the global commodity price hike, import  growth was led by elevated demand for raw materials and capital goods;  Covid vaccine procurement; and the continued need to import wheat and  sugar to plug domestic supply gaps, it said. 
“Amid a  widening current account deficit, the market-determined exchange rate  depreciated by 10.7pc in the interbank market during 1HFY22,”  said the report. 
The State Bank’s foreign exchange reserves  remained relatively stable till the end of 1HFY22, supported by a $1 bn inflow from Eurobond issuance, the additional SDR allocation of $2.8bn from the IMF in Q1, and bilateral deposits of $3bn from Saudi Arabia in Q2.
The report added that the  confluence of costlier imported commodities (such as edible oil and  pulses) and some demand-side pressures pushed national CPI inflation  into double digits during 1HFY22, as the spike in non-perishable food  prices more than offset the decrease in the prices of perishable food  items. The increase in global commodity prices also led to upward  adjustments in administered prices of petrol, LPG, and electricity. 
The  strength of the economy, the broad-based inflationary pressures and the  widening of the current account deficit necessitated a cumulative  increase of 275 basis points in the policy rate during 1HFY22. 
“This  was aimed at ensuring sustainability in both economic growth and the  external account, as well as anchoring inflation expectations,” said the  report.  
On the fiscal side, the overall deficit remained  unchanged in 1HFY22 at last year’s level of 2.1pc of GDP.  However, the primary balance narrowed to 0.1pc of GDP in 1HFY22,  from 0.6pc in the same period last year, as the increase in  non-interest expenditures more than offset the robust rise in tax  revenues.

5,CDNS to issue digital certificates,KARACHI: The Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS) and the Central Depository Company of Pakistan Ltd (CDC)...,"KARACHI: The Central Directorate of National Savings (CDNS) and the Central Depository Company of Pakistan Ltd (CDC) will convert and issue National Savings Certificates (NSCs) in the digital form.  
The two entities signed on Friday an agreement that’ll lead to the induction of NSCs into the Central Depository System (CDS) of the CDC, which already handles the electronic settlement of transactions carried out at the Pakistan Stock Exchange.
The federal government–run CDNS bypasses banks and directly generates deposits from the general public at rates of return that are pegged to the cut-off yields on government securities. As a result, ordinary people receive relatively better returns on their savings by eliminating the banks’ cut as intermediaries.
“The initiative is in line with the CDNS’s ultimate objective of the digitisation of NSCs. This platform will facilitate investors of NSCs, making it easier for them to invest in and maintain their NSCs in the electronic format, thereby promoting and harvesting the savings culture in Pakistan at the grass root level,” a statement quoted CDNS Director General Hamid Raza as saying.
Innovative, tech-based processes will lead to higher productivity, reduced turnaround times, lower costs and wider outreach, he added.
CDC CEO Badiuddin Akber said the core objective of establishing the CDC was to dematerialise — i.e. switch from paper certificates to electronic record-keeping — all types of financial instruments in Pakistan. The CDC has already dematerialised almost all types of securities, except NSCs. “It’s indeed the need of the hour that a mechanism be developed for investors to have NSCs in book-entry form,” he said while referring to the form of ownership that allows investors to own securities without a certificate.

6,Rupee regains 10.8pc in nine days,The declining trend for the greenback looks set for another week.,"KARACHI: The rupee appreciated by 1.57 per cent on a day-on-day basis to close at 215.49 against the dollar in the interbank market on Friday. 
The local currency recovered 10.8pc in the last 9 working days supporting the exchange rate to gain stability. Despite no funding from any bilateral or multilateral sources, the rupee has been gaining strength against the US dollar only in the hopes of the expected release of a $1.17bn tranche by the IMF board this month.
The declining trend for the greenback looks set for another week.
However, currency experts still believe that the speculators are benefitting from the country’s fragile foreign exchange reserves.
They were of the view that speculators were involved in the current buying and selling of the dollars and they may go to any extent to exploit the current situation.
The State Bank of Pakistan’s reserves dropped below $8bn in the last week signaling that the external front of the economy is vulnerable and the greenback could see another sharp spike in the coming days, they believe.

7,Progress on Sino-Pak collaborations reviewed,The countries have sped up the process of creating a conducive environment for business-to-business and JVs.,"ISLAMABAD: A Board of Investment (BoI) mission on Friday held a meeting with the Chinese consul general in Karachi, Li Bijian, to review the progress on enhancing collaboration between Pakistani and Chinese enterprises.
In the ambit of the recently signed ‘Framework Agreement on Industrial Cooperation’ provided by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative, the two countries have now sped up the process of creating a conducive environment for business-to-business, joint ventures, and match-making to bridge the gap between private sectors.
For its part, the BoI has circulated a list of thirty Chinese projects that are ready for investment in Pakistan to the major chambers of commerce and industry in the country. As a follow-up, BoI officials have also held meetings with the Chinese and Pakistani associations in Karachi.
BoI Executive Director General Kashishur Rehman proposed building a government-to-government special economic zone (SEZ) between Pakistan and China in order to facilitate the influx of Chinese industries relocating to Pakistan.
The Chinese diplomat was appreciative of the BoI’s move to circulate ready-to-invest projects in Pakistan’s trade and industry circles, and told BoI officials that he had offered to encourage the Chinese companies to be even more forthcoming in sharing collaboration opportunities.
The meeting resolved that with the support of BoI, Chinese missions in Pakistan and PCBIF, meaningful match-making and joint ventures could be concluded between the private sectors of the two countries.
Mr Rehman informed the Chinese envoy about the commitments made by the National Development and Reforms Commission of China to engage provincial and local governments of China in promoting industrial cooperation at all levels. He said BoI has already simplified the work visa process and visit visas and encouraged Chinese investors and enterprises to apply for work visas.
