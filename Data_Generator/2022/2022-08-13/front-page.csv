0,IMF money may arrive in Pakistan’s account by August-end,"Miftah says letter of intent for programme’s revival to be signed, returned to lender in coming days.","ISLAMABAD: The Inter­nat­ional Monetary Fund (IMF) has convened a meeting of its executive board on August 29 to approve a bailout package for Pakistan, including disbursement of about $1.18bn, before the close of current month. 
The move follows the completion of the $4 billion in bilateral financing from four friendly nations and would pave the way for an immediate disbursement, expected to be in Pakistan’s account before the end of working hours on August 31.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail told Dawn that a letter of intent (LOI) had been received early Friday from the lender for the revival of the programme under the staff level agreement (SLA) and memorandum of economic and fiscal policies (MEFP) signed last month. 
“We are going through the LOI, would sign and send [it] back to the IMF anytime soon and look forward to (executive) board meeting later this month for approval,” he said.

Miftah says letter of intent for programme’s revival to be signed, returned to lender in coming days

Sources said the executive board would meet on August 29 to take up Pakistan’s case for approval of the completion of seventh and eighth reviews of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), besides a $1bn increase in size of the programme to $7bn and the extension of its tenure to August 2023. 
Sources said the board meeting was convened after Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and China confirmed to the IMF that they had completed arrangements for $4bn in bilateral financing to Pakistan, which was the last hitch to the bailout package after completion of all the prior actions agreed under the SLA. The IMF board’s clearance was expected to reverse continuously depleting foreign exchange reser­ves, strengthen Pakistani rupee and support balance of payments.
With increase in petroleum development levy on oil products on July 31, the IMF had publically confirmed that Pakistan had completed all the prior actions for revival of its programme but had linked the approval of disbursement of $1.18bn funds by its executive board to confirmation of $4bn additional inflows from the four friendly countries. 
Since then, the rupee had been recovering against the dollar, from about Rs240 per dollar to less than Rs216 at present, and stock market had been showing robust activity following months of downturn. The exchange rate had been under continuous pressure amid declining foreign exchange reserves, mainly due to delay in formal commitment by the friendly countries. 
The finance minister had earlier claimed to have lined up $8.5bn-$10bn inflows from the friendly countries against a financing gap of $4bn estimated by the IMF, but at the same time blamed political turmoil in the country for steep currency depreciation and bullish stock market.
The IMF had announced on July 13 a much-awaited staff-level agreement with Pakistan on nine-month extension in tenor and $1bn increase in size of the bailout package to $7bn, including upfront disbursement of about $1.18bn.
Its approval from the IMF executive board was, however, linked to a series of prior actions that the government fulfilled over the past two weeks
‘Additional measures’
On top of this, the IMF also made it binding on the authorities to “stand ready to take any additional measures necessary to meet programme objectives, given the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and financial markets”. Since then, the government waived taxes on small traders and decided to impose over Rs40bn worthy of additional taxes to make up for an unseen supplementary grant required to bailout the state-run Pakistan State Oil whose more than Rs610bn is stuck up with the government, its entities or private companies choked by non-payments by the public sector.
Likewise, the government also gave a commitment to ensure timely implementation of power tariff rebasing as already determined by the power regulator along with quarterly and monthly adjustments to rein in rising circular debt which the Fund estimated to have increased by Rs850bn last year ending June 30. The government has now notified a schedule for gradual power tariff increase.
The government has since also revised the development levy on petroleum products and fixed at the rate of Rs20 on petrol and Rs10 per litre on high speed diesel, light diesel and kerosene – the last prior action under the commitment.
The original $6bn worth of 39-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) — provided to countries facing serious payment imbalances because of structural impediments or slow growth and an inherently weak balance-of-payments position — was to end in September this year, but only three tranches of about $3bn could so far be disbursed as the programme suffered repeated breakdowns.

1,Pemra moves against ARY News after licence revoked,Formal notice for shut down not issued yet; channel vows to challenge decision in court.,"ISLAMABAD: In an unprecedented move, the Pakistan Elec­tronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) revoked the operating licence of ARY News late on Friday night after the security clearance of the channel was withdrawn by the Ministry of Interior, paving the way for the permanent closure of the TV channel.
Earlier, in a notification, the interior ministry said: “The NOC issued in favour of M/S ARY Communications Pvt Limited (ARY News) is cancelled with immediate effect and until further orders on the basis of adverse reports from agencies.”
The decision by Pemra was taken during its 172nd meeting which was chaired by re-appointed chief Saleem Baig. 
Sources in the regulatory authority said Mr Baig chaired the meeting in the presence of three other members, while four members, including the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) chairman, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman and the interior secretary joined the meeting via video link. 

Channel vows to challenge decision in court; head of electronic media body slams ‘excessive measure’

After detailed information and background regarding the renewal of the operating licence, the working paper of the meeting said, “...Ministry of Interior vide letter dated 10.11.2021 had initially granted NOC/ security cle­a­rance for renewal of satellite TV licences of M/s ARY Comm­unication Ltd. However, the Ministry has withdrawn the NOC in respect of M/s ARY Comm­unication Ltd. (ARY News) vide letter dated 11.8.2022.”
“Foregoing in view and based on the fact that the mandatory requirement of security clearance has not been fulfilled since NOC has been withdrawn by Ministry of Interior, the request of M/s ARY Communication Ltd. for renewal of licence for another term of 15 years may be regretted by the authority,” the working paper added.
Although both the Pemra chairman and DG Tahir Shaikh did not respond to queries regarding the outcome of the meeting, sources confirmed that the auth­ority had approved the notification forwarded by the interior ministry and the electronic med­ia regulator could now “legally” shut down the channel’s transmission across the country. However, ARY’s transmission continued in many cities on Friday night, including Karachi, as the authority did not issue a formal notice in this regard. 
‘Excessive measure’ 
The decision to shut down the news channel was met with disapproval across the board. 
The ARY management condemned the ban, saying the network was being victimised by the federal government. This move is akin to the “economic murder of more than 4,000 media workers associated with the news channel”, it said, adding that the interior ministry’s notification will be taken to the courts as it was done without any due notice.
Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors (AEMEND) President Azhar Abbas condemned it as an “excessive measure” and said such moves have never worked. He urged the government to immediately withdraw the decision. 
PPP leader and ex-senator Farhatullah Babar tweeted that the use of state power “arbitrarily will backfire”. “There may be 101 good reasons but question as to who is competent to cancel, how & whether due process followed must be answered,” he said, adding, “Effects of [the] law of diminishing returns already becoming apparent.”

 





 
In a tweet, PTI leader Asad Umar said: “This is ‘purana’ Pakistan desperately trying to hang on. The tide of history cannot be stopped by coercive illegal measures.”
“Under the fascist regime, the freedom of the press is being curtailed. Journalists cannot speak freely. They face FIRs, arrests and bans are being imposed on TV channels,” PTI leader Farrukh Habib said. He added that people who were trying to suppress the freedom to speak were harming Pakistan.

 





 
PTI leader Ali Mohammad Khan said the decision by the ministry to revoke the NOC of the news channel was a “political” and “totally wrong” decision.
The interior ministry “takes decisions in the national interest to protect the state from all kinds of threats. It is not a party office to be used for political purposes”, he added.

 





 
ARY journalist gets bail
Separately, the Lahore High Court granted protective bail to journalist Khawar Ghumman in a case registered against him by the Islamabad police. 
Mr Ghumman, the Islamabad bureau chief of ARY News, appeared before the court along with his counsel Abuzar Salman Khan Niazi. 
His counsel argued before the court that police registered a “fake case against his client and wanted to arrest him”. 
Justice Saleem Safdar Shahid heard the petition and granted Mr Ghumman interim protective bail for seven days to enable him to approach the court concerned for the pre-arrest bail.

2,"Pakistan, Turkiye sign agreement to boost trade",ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Turkiye have signed a preferential trade agreement (PTA) to boost trade in certain products...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Turkiye have signed a preferential trade agreement (PTA) to boost trade in certain products between the two countries.  
Since the signing of a framework agreement on March 22, 2016, both sides have held 14 rounds of bilateral negotiations to identify those products for trade which are not affecting each other’s interests.  
The PTA will come into effect from January 1, 2023. The concessions will be offered in three phases — immediately, up to five years and up to 10 years.  
Turkish Trade Minister Dr Mehmet Mus and Minister for Commerce Naveed Qamar signed the agreement at a ceremony in the presence of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.  
Under the agreement, the Turkish side has offered concessions on a total of 261 tariff lines. Pakistan’s exports value of these tariff lines stand at $5.1 billion or 16 per cent of the total exports, while Turkish global imports in these products amount to $7.6bn. Now it depends on Pakistani exporters how they exploit the narrow margin availability in these products.  
Duty will be reduced to zero per cent on 123 tariff lines, including five agricultural and 118 industrial products. The current exports value of these products is $714 million, while Turkish global imports of these products stand at $3.920bn.  
Customs duty on average is 2-3pc. However, additional customs duty is 20pc for industrial products, which will be reduced. This is one area having potential to increase exports of non-traditional products.  
Turkiye will reduce duty to zero per cent on 92 tariff lines during a period between five and 10 years. Pakistan’s exports value of these products is $1.608bn, while Turkish global imports stand at $2.084bn.  
Turkiye has offered a margin of preferences and tariff rate quota on agriculture products to Pakistan. The categories of products which will get benefit from the concessions are: leather, footwear, glass and ceramics, articles of base metal, plastics and rubber, furniture, mattresses and lamps, sports and engineering goods, chemicals and cosmetics, agriculture products and processed agriculture.  
In response to that, Pakistan has offered concessions to Turkiye on 130 tariff lines. The total exports value of these products is $23bn or 12pc of its total global exports. Pakistan’s global imports of these products stand at $6bn.  
Pakistan will reduce duty to zero per cent on 16 tariff lines for Turkiye. Pakistan’ global imports of these tariff lines stand at $1.224bn, while Turkish global exports of these products are $2.486bn. Duty will be reduced to zero per cent in five to 10 years on 16 tariff lines. Turkish global exports of these tariff lines stand at $2.123bn, while Pakistan’s imports of these products are $684m.  
Pakistan will exempt duty for Turkiye immediate on cocoa powder, acrylic filament and staple fibre, nonwoven man-made filament, black tea, modems, wire condensers, flavours for food industry, machine for reception and transmission, enzymes and gum base.  
In five years, the duty will be exempted on chocolate crumbs, active yeast, flavouring powders, animal feed, laboratory reagents, clamps of steel, copper wire 6mm, pressure reducing valves and slide fasteners. In 10 years, duty will be reduced on clips, brackets of iron and steel, mounting, fitting for furniture, parts of sorting, screening, grinding machines, apparatus for transmission of voice, etc.

3,Minister threatens polio vaccine boycott in ex-Fata areas,Says people would boycott vaccination campaign if govt and security institutions fail to restore peace.,"PESHAWAR: Federal Min­ister for Religious Aff­airs Maulana Abdul Shakoor has warned that people of the erstwhile tribal areas would boycott a polio vaccination campaign if the government and security institutions failed to restore peace.
“We want to make it clear that if the government and security institutions fail to provide us with peace, the people of [formerly] Fata won’t accept the measures being taken by the government, on top of which is polio vaccination,” he said in a widely circulated video on social media.
He said the boycott might be followed by civil disobedience campaign “like the one started by (PTI chief) Imran Khan”.
He said the JUI-F did not favour such protest measures, but people were being compelled to head towards such a situation. He urged the security institutions and the government to restore peace in those areas before things got out of control.
While it could not be confirmed who had filmed the video, the JUI-F’s provincial information secretary Abdul Jalil Jan confirmed to Dawn that Maulana Shakoor was addressing a delegation of party leaders and workers from former tribal areas in Peshawar.
He said it was an internal meeting of the party where the media was not invited, but someone might have uploaded the video on social media.
In the video, the minister also spoke about the recent killing of a JUI-F leader Qari Samiuddin in North Waziristan and last year’s killing of another leader, Maulana Abdul Salam in Bajaur, and asked the participants to stage protests and highlight the killings.
He also asked them to condemn the provincial government and the security institutions “as they have completely failed in maintaining peace”.
The video footage has since drawn criticism on social media.
“Sitting federal minister Mufti Shakoor of JUI-F announces boycott of polio vaccination,” activist Gul Bukhari wrote on Twitter and wondered if such people could remain in the cabinet of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

 





 
Some of his supporters defended him by uploading one of his previous videos in which he was supporting the polio vaccination campaign in the erstwhile Fata.

4,PTI hires firm to ‘improve image’ in US,"Documents reveal party to pay firm $25,000 per month; Fawad Chaudhry says firm engaged to communicate party’s viewpoint in US media.","• Documents reveal party to pay firm $25,000 per month
• Fawad says firm engaged to communicate party’s viewpoint in US media
WASHINGTON: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) US chapter has hired a public relations firm to improve its image in the United States, where it has been portrayed as anti-America since April, when party chairman and former premier Imran Khan accused Washington of backing efforts to overthrow his government through a no-confidence motion.
Following his ouster in April, Mr Khan and his party have been running a systematic campaign on the narrative that the US backed “local abettors” to topple his government through a conspiracy, and install an administration of its choice.
However, this latest move suggests that the party is looking to carry out damage control following its leader’s campaign, vilifying the US to win over popular support in Pakistan.
“This is an agreement between a PR firm, not a lobbyist, and a group of US citizens,” Sajjad Burki, the PTI chairman’s focal person for the US, told Dawn. “We are not lobbying for PTI Pakistan, and certainly not within the US administration.”
The agreement, signed on Aug 1 between David Fenton of Fenton/Arlook and attorney for PTI USA Salman Ravala became effective on Aug 9. It points out that PTI USA “is not supervised, owned, or controlled by any foreign political party, but will in certain instances be directed by a foreign political party in Pakistan”.
The PTI USA will pay the firm $25,000 per month, “collected from PTI supporters who are legal US residents”, Atif Khan, another PTI official, in Dallas, Texas, told Dawn.
The documents filed on Aug 9 showed the party had engaged Fenton/Arlock LLC to support the PTI’s “goals for good relations with the United States and the Pakistani diaspora in the US”.
The documents appear to lend credence to reports that the party was trying to mend its ties with the Biden administration after relentlessly accusing it of backing efforts to overthrow the PTI government through a “conspiracy”, which includes backing the Pakistan Democratic Movement that is in power in Islamabad.
Under the agreement, the New York-based PTI USA is the principal client of the PR firm, which has been hired for six months to manage the party’s public and media relations.
The same firm has previously represented the Pakistan embassy in the US for a brief period while the PTI was in power. Former prime minister Imran Khan also had dinner at Fenton’s in 2019 when he visited New York to attend the UN General Assembly session.
Both agreements – with the PTI USA and the embassy – are available on an official US website as public documents. The documents have been made public under the US Foreign Agents Registration Act, on a website controlled by the Unit of Counterintelligence and Exports Control in the US National Security Division, which falls under the Department of Justice.
A document filed on March 26 shows the firm had been contracted to work for the embassy from March 21 to Sept 20, 2022. But an embassy official told Dawn the contract was cancelled in May after the ouster of the PTI government.
Under the agreement, the firm was providing public relations services to the embassy, which included distributing information to and briefing journalists; placing articles and broadcasts in the respective media; arranging interviews with representatives and supporters of Pakistan; advising on social media efforts; and other such PR services.
For this, the firm was charging $30,000 a month, plus expenses.
Usually, when such a contract is cancelled, the hiring party is required to pay the entire amount specified in the agreement.
A US lawyer, who requested not to be identified because he was not involved in the case, told Dawn that “there’s nothing illegal in either agreement. Foreign governments and parties often hire PR persons and lobbyists in the US. It’s not unusual”.
The lawyer also said the amount mentioned in the two documents – $25,000 and $30,000 per month – “are peanuts. Other embassies and organisations pay much more”.
Under its agreement with the PTI USA, “Fenton/Arlook shall provide public relations services, including but not limited to distributing information to and briefing journalists, placing articles and broadcasts, arranging interviews with representatives or supporters of PTI, advising on social media efforts and other such public relations services”.
Until recently, the PTI USA publicly promoted Mr Khan’s claim that a US State Department official had threatened to topple his government in a lunch meeting with the then Pakistani ambassador Asad Majeed Khan.
But since last month, the party has been trying to rebuild its ties with the US, and it is alleged that recently the PTI chairman held a video call with US Ambassador in Islamabad Donald Blome.
‘Seeking pardon from US’
Meanwhile, the ruling PML-N was quick to avail the opportunity to take on PTI chief Khan over the ‘hypocrisy’.
“I have never had any doubts that Imran Khan has a hundred faces. What he poses and professes is a smoke screen. Behind this smoke screen is the face of an egomaniac, narcissist & selfish person. He is now begging the USA by all means whether by sending emissaries or engaging lobbyists,” federal minister Ahsan Iqbal said in a tweet on Friday.
Federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman also urged the PTI to tender an unconditional apology for what she called misleading the nation through its fake and concocted narrative to target its political rivals.
At a media briefing in Islamabad, she said the PTI had quietly hired an American lobbying firm to improve its ties, perception in the US and enhance its advertisements.
“You have repeatedly perpetrated propaganda against the US and befooled the nation under your fake narrative,” the minister stressed. “What kind of hypocrisy is this that the entire nation was engulfed in hoax propaganda and this party secretly hired a lobbyist firm to improve its projection in the US?”
She also questioned the claims of some PTI leaders that the agreement was meant for the PTI’s advertisement in the American media, saying: “Why do you need advertisements in the US?”
In the same breath, Ms Rehman also claimed that during the recent visit of the US ambassador to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI had held talks with him, and Imran Khan allegedly secretly spoke to him too.
“You are not going to improve Pakistan’s image rather your own party’s in the US. Who is imported now, as you have been accusing all other political parties of being foreign assisted?” she remarked.
However, in his party’s defence, former PTI minister Fawad Chaudhry tweeted in response to a journalist’s tweet that he had asked for an Urdu translation of the agreement “so that some incompetent journalists and ministers understand that it’s not a lobbyist firm, but a media relations firm that the PTI USA has engaged to put its point across in the media. It’s the job of these firms to develop a relationship between the media and the party”.
Zulqernain Tahir in Lahore and Jamal Shahid in Islamabad also contributed to this report.

5,Imran ‘open to talks’ with PDM if polls announced,"PTI chief admits Shahbaz Gill made ""objectionable"" statement, deplores ban on ARY News.","ISLAMABAD: In a dep­a­r­ture from his traditional stance that he would never negotiate with the ‘crooks and looters’ currently in power, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan said on Friday the doors of negotiations were always open, even with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM).
“We are ready to talk to PDM on everything after they announce the date for the fresh elections,” he said, claiming that the PDM leadership was “confused” as due to their falling popularity they didn’t want snap polls.
Amid speculations that he may be disqualified for life under Article 62 (1)(f) in light of the Toshakhana and prohibited funding cases against him, ostensibly to pave the way for the return of ex-PM Nawaz Sharif to national politics, the former prime minister said he would not cut any deals to this effect. 
He made these remarks on Friday during the ‘Independence Diamond Jubilee Special’ session on Zoom, which was attended by journalists and celebrities among others. 

PTI chief admits Gill made ‘objectionable’ statement, deplores ban on news channel

In response to a question, Mr Khan said efforts were underway for a “technical knockout” and added that references in the Tosha­khana case and prohibited funding case were part of a ‘Plan C’ to remove him from the political scene. 
According to Mr Khan, these cases will be dismissed in courts as they contained “nothing substantial”. 
“However, the Sword of Damocles is hanging over my head,” he added.
“They are trying that after the propaganda which may result in a ban [on Imran from politics] they will offer a deal that if the ban on Imran Khan is to be removed, then similar treatment should be extended to Nawaz Sharif as well. It is a bargain like that,” Mr Khan told the participants of the Zoom session.
He said that his cases and Nawaz’s cases were not similar, but a deal was still being sought. “I have not made a deal, nor will I cut one,” the PTI chief said, terming the rumoured deal an ‘NRO-2’ for Mr Sharif. He added that the “conspiracy” to sideline him will eventually harm the country.
In response to a question regarding another extension to the chief of army staff, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Imran Khan said that appointments in the military, including that of the military chief, should be made on merit. “We should strive for merit in the army so that best officers could rise through the ranks,” he added.
The PTI chief, while talking about a ban on ARY News, said the tv channel was banned not because of the comments made by his chief of staff Shahbaz Gill, but because it was an attempt to stifle the voices supporting him. He admitted that a sentence uttered by Mr Gill during the TV show was “absolutely objectionable” but banning the news outlet over the PTI leader’s remarks still did not make sense.
About the resurgence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa region, Mr Khan feared it looked like a plan to “destabilise” his party’s government in the province. He, however, warned about the fallout of the move.

6,"COAS Bajwa links world peace with impartiality, mutual defence","Becomes first-ever Pakistani dignitary to be invited to Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst as chief guest.","ISLAMABAD: Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Friday linked global peace with the impartiality of multilateral forums, collective defense of the common good and the supremacy of international law, as the head of the army became the first-ever Pakistani dignitary to be invited by the British monarch as a chief guest to the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.
“In the interest of world peace, we must strive to preserve the vitality, relevance and internal sense of impartiality in multilateral institutions, maintain consensus on the collective defense of global commons and uphold the prestige of international law.
“In case we fail to do that, I am afraid we may end up destroying the beautiful world that we have,” Gen Bajwa said while speaking at the Sovereign’s Parade for Commissioning Course 213.
Apart from the UK, 41 international cadets from 26 countries, including two from Pakistan — Cadet Mohammad Abdullah Babar Malik and Cadet Mujtaba Ahmed Malik — were among those passed out. 

COAS becomes first-ever Pakistani dignitary to be invited to Sandhurst as chief guest

Reacting to the visit, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also tweeted: “COAS Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s address at Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, the UK, as chief guest is not just a matter of honour for the armed forces but also for Pakistan. This is a recognition of the Pakistan-UK strategic partnership & the success of our armed forces in war on terror.”

 





 
In his address, Gen Bajwa said the primary reason for the existence of the armed forces should not be to prosecute wars, but to ensure that they do not take place. “Mankind’s destiny, more than ever before, hinges on our collective capacity to come together and take the route of peace and cooperation instead of conflict, communication instead of clash and multilateralism instead of self-preservation,” he said.
He said his presence at the academy was a testament to the deep-rooted relationship between Pakistan and the UK, which was based on mutual respect and shared values carefully nurtured by both nations over many decades. “Our huge Pakistani diaspora in the United Kingdom displays the strength of our historic relationship,” the army chief pointed out.
Similarly, he said, the bond between the two armed forces was uniquely special as well, forged on the battlefields of great wars and kept alive over the years through exclusive regimental affiliations and close professional contact in training and a myriad of other military activities.
AI’s role in war
Addressing the cadets, the COAS said that as a direct consequence of the onset of fourth industrial revolution, dual-use technologies and niche capabilities led by artificial intelligence were fundamentally altering the character of future wars.
He noted that the battlefields of the future would be characterised by extr­eme precision, lethality and transparency that would be particularly challenging for military leaders, especially young officers in the battle, both mentally and physically. “This future is inevitable, and each one of you would have to adapt to new realities in the technological domain to ensure successful outcome in the battle,” he remarked.
Gen Bajwa said while it was important to understand the change in the character of war, there were some realities in battlefield that would never change. He highlighted the value of keeping up a brave face in front of the troops, even when one is as shattered and frightened inside as all of them. “Remember, when lot of lead is flying in the air in the battlefield, an officer never says advance, rather always says follow me,” he said. 
Gen Bajwa said Sandhurst, which has groomed boys and girls from the UK and Commonwealth countries from across the world for over 200 years, is without a doubt one of the finest military institutions that produced some of the greatest military leaders this world has ever seen.
“Two Pakistani cadets would also be graduating with you today. Let me say that I am as proud of you all, as I am proud of them,” the army chief said.
He said correct decision-making required competence and confidence, which could only be acquired through high-class military education, rigorous training and continuous study of military history.
