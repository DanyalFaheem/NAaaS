0,‘E-Learn Punjab’ hardly worked during Covid lockdown,Probe finds programme partially successful but not impactful.,"LAHORE: An inquiry committee formed by the provincial government has found the project of ‘E-Learn Punjab (Phase-I)’ launched for schools not so successful on several fronts, such as cost and utility for teachers and students.
The Punjab School Education Department launched the project to resolve the issue of ownership, copyright, licensing and balancing of reach with legitimate commercial interests. E-Learning resources include animated, localized topics and self-learning exercises, and digital books.
The project is an open online and offline repository of digital content for kindergartner to class 12 students. Previously, the Punjab Curriculum and Textbook Board (PCTB) were publishing hard copies for school students. 
The project was originally approved on Dec 30, 2013, at a cost of Rs61.952 million with a gestation period of 18 months. The project cost was later revised to Rs140.369 million and the gestation period extended to Dec 31, 2016.

Probe finds programme partially successful but not impactful

In the second revision, the project cost was revised to Rs199.175 million and the gestation period was extended to June 2018. In the third revision, the cost was revised to Rs191.935 million and the gestation period was extended to June 2019. The actual expenditure of the project is Rs186.171 million against the release amount of Rs245.837 million.
The Punjab government formed a team of the Directorate General Monitoring and Evaluation to evaluate the project.
The report’s major observations include the needs assessment was not carried out for this project. It is revealed from the school census of 2018 data that 20 percent of government schools have internet facilities and 16pc of schools have a computer lab.
Similarly, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey of 2017-18 reported that internet access in Punjab is a 26pc at households - rural areas have 18.9pc internet access and urban areas 38.6pc. Ignoring the quality of internet services, these stats do not support this kind of intervention.
The project implementation was not well worked out. Initially, only English books of the PCTB were uploaded to the e-learn portal having voice over in the Urdu language. The voice-over quality was not good. Currently, the voice-over has been removed from the books.
It states that the project is technically not very complex in nature; spending Rs87 million on human resources is on the higher side.
There are many off the shelf software solutions available for the creation of e-books that can create e-books on the fly. Also, the creation of e-books is a repetitive activity in nature, once an e-book is created, you have to follow the same pattern for the creation of other e-books. Revising a project based on different grades seems not a good idea.
Because of this, the project has been revised three times, increasing its cost from Rs 61.95 million to Rs191.935 million and project durations from 18 months to 66 months. 
It states that offline content was not introduced through DVDs, USBs and memory cards for students/teachers so that they can use them for personal devices. Some of the tablets given to staff and in the labs for students of eight selected schools were found broken and non-functional at different schools.
When the schools were closed during Covid-19, E-Learn was not used to continue the educational activities online. The main reason is the lack of coordination among the different stakeholders of the project and the lack of required resources at the teacher and student end.
The evaluators observed that during the visit and from beneficiary surveys, most of the students do not have internet facilities available at their homes.
It was observed during beneficiary surveys that most of the students (approximately 76%) were taking coaching classes, so it indicates that E-Learn is not very effective for students to act as a replacement for coaching classes.
It states the selected schools where E-Learn classrooms and labs were established, also do not have technical resources. The E-Learn system user interface is not classroom friendly while using LEDs. It is hard to navigate back and forth on the LEDs. It is observed during school visits that teachers bring their own collection of videos and run from USB.
The SOPs were not prepared for the proper usage of the provided gadgets for students, teachers and also there was no maintenance plan for gadgets. Although the recurring cost of the project HR is included, details of the posts are not given.

1,Seraiki Lok Sanjh rejects South Punjab province bill,"Says submitting the bill now, when the govt is facing a no-trust move in the National Assembly, reeks of insincerity.","DERA GHAZI KHAN: The Seraiki Lok Sanjh issued a press statement on Sunday rejecting the presentation of the South Punjab Province Bill in Parliament by the ruling party. 
The body notes the introduction of the bill by the government proposes to amend the constitution to create the province of South Punjab. 
“As advocates for the creation of a Seraiki (South Punjab) province over the last four decades, we are dismayed that the bill has been introduced at a time when the government is fighting to save itself in the face of popular discontent and a loss of confidence among members of the National Assembly”, reads the note. 
The Sanjh expressed its dismay over the development: “The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf came to power by centring the redressal of the grievances of the people of the Seraiki Waseb in its manifesto. Since coming to power, we have found them uncommitted to the creation of the South Punjab province. 
We note that the Law and Justice Committee of the National Assembly had, in 2019, recommended the creation of a Parliamentary Committee that would consider the issue and work to build parliamentary consensus on the creation of the new province. 
This recommendation was not implemented by the government, which left the issue dormant and did not make any efforts towards building the required majority that was required to pass a constitutional amendment delimiting the new province”.
It said submitting the bill now at a time when the government is facing a consequential and likely successful vote of no-confidence in the National Assembly reeks of insincerity. It is clear the government wishes to exploit the legitimate grievances of the people of the Seraiki Waseb to delay and distract from the constitutionally mandated process by which it must submit to a vote of no-confidence. 
The note concluded that it was disappointing to us that Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, who has long claimed himself to be our representative, is at the forefront of the cynical move.

4,Symposium on genetic diseases: 50pc infant mortality linked to high rate of consanguinity,"Experts blame cousin, same-caste marriages","LAHORE: Declaring genetic disorders a “silent pandemic”, the Pakistan and German medical experts say that nearly 50 percent of the mortality in infancy is linked to the high rate of consanguinity in Pakistan. 
Sharing the outcome of a joint study presented in a symposium arranged by the Children’s Hospital Lahore, the senior medics from Germany pointed out an alarmingly-high rate of genetic disorders among the local population, adding that the percentage of consanguinity ranged from 78percent to even 100pc in some rural areas. 
Sponsored by the German government and Arcensus institute (Germany), the symposium was organised at the Anne Marie Schimmel Institute on The Mall with a theme “Genetic Matters to Everyone”. 
“We have so far performed tests of 30,000 families, including children, in all the four provinces of the country and Islamabad. The results show over 70pc of them were carriers”, says Prof Huma Arshad Cheema, the head of the Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology of Children’s Hospital Lahore. She also played a key role in Pakistan to launch country-wide investigations into the burden of the diseases related to various genetic disorders. 

Experts blame cousin, same-caste marriages

Talking to Dawn, she says, the study has highlighted that the cousin and same-caste marriages are wreaking havoc by increasing the number of children with disabilities in Pakistan. 
“I am not against cousin marriage or marriage in the same cast, but I would strongly suggest taking doctor’s advice for risk assessment before taking such decisions”, she says, adding that the pre-marriage screening tests should be declared mandatory. 
Unfortunately, she says, there is no facility for testing patients for any genetic disease in the country. “The access to diagnosis is limited as genetic testing is highly expensive and no public sector hospital offers free testing for genetic diseases in Pakistan”, she says. 
A leading private hospital in Karachi is sending blood samples to a foreign country for the diagnosis of any genetic disorder. Similarly, two private hospitals of Lahore are also availing the same facility abroad, she says, adding that each test costs Rs300,000, which is highly expensive. 
“We provided this facility to the patients free of cost and have done tests of 300,000 individuals from all over the country”, Prof Huma says. The tests were performed in collaboration with German partners Prof Arndt Rolfs and Prof Peter Beur at Arcensus and the Centogene (Germany). The results turned out to be alarming as over 70 percent of them were found carrying some sort of genetic disorder linked to diseases like cancer and liver, kidney and neurological ailments etc, she says. 
“If preventive measures are not taken and awareness is not created at public and private sector hospitals, we will be heading to a disaster”, Prof Huma warned. 
She further says the joint team of senior doctors from Germany and Pakistan set up camps at Children’s Hospital Lahore, besides facilities at Multan, Islamabad, Karachi and other parts of the country to examine such patients. 
“In Lahore’s Children Hospital we examined nearly 200 families, including children, since March 20”, she says, adding that the pregnancy screening and other tests showed over 50 percent of them were careers of genetic diseases. 
‘Pakistan has a huge burden of genetic diseases due to high rate of consanguinity. The quoted rate of consanguinity [in Pakistan] ranges from 78pc to even 100pc in some rural areas” Prof Huma says. It is estimated that 50pc of mortality in infancy is caused by genetic diseases in Pakistan, she adds. 
She stressed the need for adopting a multi-pronged approach to raise awareness, improve diagnostic facilities and access to treatment and prenatal diagnosis of genetic diseases. 
Addressing the symposium, Arcensus Chief Executive Officer Prof Rolfs spoke about the impact of the genetic disorders and the measures being taken for prevention in Pakistan. 
He says the cooperation between Pakistani hospitals and Arcensus is not new. “Over the last year, Arcensus has diagnosed genetic disorders in more than 2,000 Pakistani children with the help of advanced genetic testing technique called Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) free of cost to help them and their families live a better life.” 
“As Arcensus CEO and founder, I believe this symposium is only the beginning of an even closer cooperation”, he said. 
University of Child Health Sciences Vice Chancellor Prof Masood Sadiq announced that he was going to approve establishment of a genetic institute at the varsity. He highlighted the huge donations being given to the liver unit of the Children’s Hospital Lahore for treatment of such patients. 
Cricket legend Misbaul Haq spoke to the affected families and vowed to become an ambassador for raising awareness about the issue.

5,Haqooq-e-Khalq to contest all elections,Holds public rally of groups of the Left; rejects current system of democracy,"LAHORE: In a bid to reactivate themselves politically, the groups belonging to the Left held a public meeting on Sunday in a show of ‘no-confidence’ in the governance system in vogue. 
Assembled under the banner of the Haqooq-e-Khalq Movement (HKM) at the Nasser Bagh, they pledged to become a political alternative for the working classes whose voice was being ignored by the mainstream political parties. They vowed to work for ending the ‘welfare state’ status for the rich and making the working class as the third force in national politics.  
Bringing together working people from across Lahore as well as from Murdike, Faisalabad, Toba Tek Singh and Kot Addu, the HKM promised that it would put working classes at the centre of local and national politics, instead of the small groups of the elite fighting out amongst each other to grab power. 
It announced that the HKM would be registered as a party and that it would contest all local and national elections while fielding candidates from working people.  
HKM chief Ammar Ali Jan, rights activist Hina Jilani, Farooq Tariq, Farrukh Suhail Goindi, Irfan Mufti, Rabbiya Bajwa advocate and others spoke.  

Holds public rally of groups of the Left; rejects current system of democracy

Mr Jan said [Imran Khan’s] stage in Islamabad public meeting displayed representatives of the land, sugar and education mafias and the landlords while the Nasser Bagh stage was set by the people from the working class and the localities like Kot Lakhpat, Chungi Amar Sidhu, Shahdara, Muridke etc.  
He rejected the governance system in vogue called democracy, saying those born with silver spoons in their mouths were spending over Rs200m to win a National Assembly seat. He said that the HKM would bring about true national unity, in opposition to the ‘separatist’ elite that lived in gated housing schemes and that had built separate health and educational facilities for itself.  
Ammar Ali Jan said Pakistan was not a poor country but the wealth of the poor was being stolen and put in the coffers of the rich. He added that only the elite in Pakistan received subsidies and packages, which meant that Pakistan was in reality a welfare state for the rich. He promised that the unity of working populations would bring about true democracy and rights back to them.  
Ms Jilani said the political and economic situation of the country had never been worse than the present times, putting democracy at stake.  
Warning the ‘selectors’ not to indulge in the ‘selection’ again, she urged the masses to always stand for human rights for the future of their children and the country.  
Commenting on the events in Islamabad, Farooq Tariq said the people of Pakistan would say good riddance if Imran Khan was ousted but they also knew that the opposition had no social or economic alternative for them. He said both the government and opposition were paying people to go with them to Islamabad for their respective rallies but the real working people of Lahore had come to the HKM Jalsa because it represented their real voice.  
Ms Bajwa said problems of the masses could be solved only through political movements, like the one being launched by the HKM, which could raise the issues of the labourers, peasants and women.  
The participants carried red flags and placards inscribed with their demands like saying no hike in educational institutions’ fees, change the system not faces, revolution incomplete without the voice of women etc.

6,Punjabi ‘Dhugga’ and its glorious history,Have you ever thought as to why Punjabis sometimes are ‘Dhugga (bulls/oxen)? It apparently seems to be a ...,"Have you ever thought as to why Punjabis sometimes are ‘Dhugga (bulls/oxen)? It apparently seems to be a pejorative phrase and a loaded one. Interestingly, if we look beneath the patina of time we will discover that 1, it wasn’t originally denigrating as it seems now, 2, it has a very long history linked with the evolution of our agrarian production.  
What is the most prominent symbol/motif of Harappa civilisation? The famous bull! It appears on the seals and other objects found during the excavation of a score of Harappa archaeological sites. This magnificent Harappa bull, strong and big, is humped like the bulls or oxen we still have in Punjab, especially in its Dhunn region (Chakwal and adjoining areas).  
Intriguingly, in the Vedic culture, the most conspicuous animal is the cow, not bull. The cow in Harappa culture is as inconspicuous as the bull is in the Vedic society. The stress on the bull in the former and on the cow in the latter obviously signifies the crucial importance that arose from the economic needs of each which later got religious or metaphysical sanction.  
Harappa society, sophisticated and advanced, stood erected on a large agrarian base which produced a surplus for its urban development. In the agricultural production and domestic economy of that epoch, the bull played a pivotal role; it was raised for breeding purposes and when castrated it worked as a powerful draft animal. So stress was on the bull but could it exist without a cow? Obviously no.  
In the Vedic society which came into existence as a result of interaction, complex and torturous, stress, on the contrary, is on the cow. This again is linked with the specific economic needs of Vedic Aryans who were mostly nomadic pastoralists and herders. They weren’t settled and were unacquainted with agrarian practices which were signs of higher socio-economic development. Being roaming tribes they mainly depended on two animals; horses and cows. The horse was valued for facilitating movement, herding cattle, and fighting the war. The cow was prized for being an important source of food and also for its offspring which were employed for ploughing.
As Aryan tribes gradually got settled, the stress imperceptibly shifted from horse to cow. In the earlier times cow too was killed in a ritual sacrifice. Horse sacrifice (Ashvamedha) was performed mostly by kings and rulers.
Wendy Doniger writes in her book The Hindus: “The Vedic people sacrificed cattle to the gods and ate cattle themselves…one verse states that cows were ‘not to be killed (a-ghnya)’, but another says that a cow should be slaughtered on the occasion of marriage, and other lists among animals to be sacrificed a cow that has been bred but has not calved”.
It took long for the cow to become an object of veneration. “Gradually, from the Mauryan period onwards the references to cow killing began to figure less in our sources. The Brahmins who were the main proponents of sacrifices, now began to discourage and even disapprove of the killing of the cow”, says historian DN Jha.  
If you keep the religious and ideological mumbo jumbo aside, you clearly discern in the historical process of Aryans’ transformation from pastoralists to agriculturalists a gradual emphasis from cow slaughtering to cow veneration. Not that it was not an important animal in the Vedic epoch, but it became more so in the post-Vedic age with the increased dependence on farming. The cow provided milk, calves - would be bulls and oxen - and dung as free fuel in the land that was witnessing the vanishing of wilds and jungle with the increase in population.
So the bull for the Harappans and cow for the Aryans. The former obliquely own the cows by owning the bull while the latter obliquely own the bull by owning the cow. It’s worth remembering that Ausra was an indigenous god opposed to Aryan gods (Surya) as well as the name of the Harappa tribes as mentioned in Rig-Veda and Vedic literature. Professor Malti J Shendge writes in her The Civilized Demons; “The proud Brahmani Bull on the seals and later expressions comparing man to the bull Naravrshbha may be indicative of the importance of bulls as an animal associated with Asura, who is said to have given birth to the first bull”.  
It’s interesting to note that the most prominent mythological figure to come out of the Asura tribes of Harappa is none other than the glorious Lord Shiva who was widely worshipped across Punjab before the Turk invasions from the north till the late 10th and early 11th centuries. The grand architectural ensemble at Katas Raj housing a Shiv temple in our Potohar region is a testimony to the fact if needed at all. Lord Shiva, the god of Harappa has his bull called Nandi. It’s his mount. Another Harappa tribe was Panis who were mostly bankers and tradesmen. They had, the stories tell us, their assets in the shape of large cowherds. They stole cows from some of the Vedic sages and hid them in mountain caves and gods sent Sarama, the bitch, to trace the stolen animals. Despite this conflict, the Panis are less demonised compared with other Harappa tribes in the Vedic and post-Vedic literature. The reason could be that being business people they resisted the Aryans less. So the question as to why Punjabis are called “Dhuggas (Bulls/Oxen) becomes easier to address. The bull was the proud symbol of Harappa tribes that embodied the virility, strength, and abundance which made Punjab the granary of a vast human settlement spreading over a huge chunk of the subcontinent. So there are concrete historical reasons that Punjabis are likened to bulls. We don’t need to be apologetic at all about being associated with an animal that brought prosperity to our land that laid the foundation of one of the most advanced and peaceful civilisations in the ancient world.  
The vestigial traces of a bygone era when we Punjabis loved bulls and were like bulls can still be found in our folklore. “Qurban Dhuni da vassna/ hik baaka joda rakhna (What a delight to live in the Dhun region and own a pair of splendid bulls) is a line from a folk song. And for our dairy, we the ‘Duggas/ bulls’ love buffaloes more than cows. Life isn’t as simple as it appears to be. — soofi01@hotmail.com

7,Dance performance on 31st,LAHORE: A fusion performance of folk and classical dance will be held at Shakir Ali Museum on March 31.,"LAHORE: A fusion performance of folk and classical dance will be held at Shakir Ali Museum on March 31.  
The performers will be from the National Performing Art Group (NPAG) and the show has been choreographed by noted kathak dancer Adnan Jahangir.  
The performance will be organised by Shakir Ali Museum, the regional office of the Pakistan National Council of the Arts. “The NPAG will perform after a hiatus of two years as it will be their first performance after the pandemic,” Shakir Ali Museum Director Tania Suhail told Dawn on Sunday.  
She said dresses had specially been designed for the exclusive show titled, Bahar Ayee. Ms Suhail said Adnan Jahangir had been training the group for their upcoming performance for the last one month. 
The NPAG, the high-scale dance wing of the PNCA, was established in 2006. The group has inspired choreographers such as Roshan Ara Bokhari and Zarin Pana to share their expertise with it. The group over the years had different choreographers who worked with the NPAG and the performers used to be taught an average seven dances every year. By now, they have learnt over 100 dances including Peacock Dance, Candle Dance, Cotton Picker’s Dance, Basant Bahar Dance, Jhoomar, Harvest Dance, Dhamal, Luddi, and Bhangra, besides Katthak and other forms of classical dance. 
In the past, it was decided that the group would perform at the Shakir Ali Museum after every two months but this process could not be followed.  
Ms Suhail said Shakir Ali Museum would try its best to hold regular performances of the NPAG Lahore wing. She said work was being done on a cultural calendar which includes visual and performing art classes, talks and discussions.

8,"Separated by Partition, brothers reconnect at Faisalabad village",Village residents warmly welcome 78-year-old Sikka Khan.,"TOBA TEK SINGH: Scores of resident of Chak 255-RB Bogran in the Dijkot area of Faisalabad warmly welcomed Indian citizen Sikka Khan (78) when he arrived at the house of his brother Siddiq Khan (80) on Saturday night after waiting for his entry into Pakistan for two months. 
Sikka (real name is Muhammad Habib) and Siddiq Khan were separated during the Partition of India. Their father was killed in the violence, Siddiq and his sister moved to Pakistan while Sikka was left in India along with his mother. Both brothers had met at Kartarpur Corridor on Jan 10 this year with the help of a Pakistani YouTuber Nasir Dhillon and his team. Both the brothers had appealed to Prime Minister Imran Khan to issue the younger brother a visa for visiting Pakistan. The Pakistan government had immediately issued Sikka a visa for two months. However, he could not come earlier due to the restrictions from the Indian side. His visa was still valid when the Indian government lifted the restrictions and Sikka travelled to Pakistan to meet his brother. 
Sikka Khan had crossed Wagha-Attari border on Saturday where he was welcomed by Siddiq and his family, including grandchildren. He was clad holding a long club as a support to walk and wearing a peach turban. YouTuber Nasir Dhillon was also there to welcome him. It took them several hours to reach Chak 255-RB Bogran as there were hurdles on the highways due to political rallies. In the village, as soon as Sikka Khan stepped out of the car, almost all male residents of the village, especially the youth, started dancing on the drumbeats while flowers and currency notes were showered on him. Both brothers were looking very happy after seeing each other for the second time since the Partition.  
Sikka Khan said although the visa was granted to him two months ago but the Covid-19 restrictions were the hurdle in his way to reach Pakistan. He said he could not get married as he had become an orphan as his mother had also died after the Partition and he lived with his relatives in Chak Pulewal of district Bathinda. On Sunday, the people of Chak 255-RB Bogran and adjoining villages visited the house of Siddiq Khan and met Sikka Khan. They greeted him both the brothers.

The workshop consists of eight sessions, three of which were held on Saturday. As many as 90 candidates from across the country attended the workshop.  
Englishers President Dr Muntazar Mehdi said generating ideas was easy but what’s difficult was conceiving and executing those ideas. 
He said the workshop would set an example and would be followed by other training programmes.
Englishers Director Training Dr Antonio Taglialatela introduced the field of research, its challenges (especially for young writers) and purpose of the ongoing training.  
AIOU former vice chancellor Prof Dr Shahid Siddiqui said the definition of education as a process of communicating information was very misleading. Instead, education is not only the preservation of past knowledge; rather it is also a process of constructing new knowledge on a regular basis.  
OUP’s Mr Zaid discussed genres of publishing books, types of intellectual property and copyright issues.
