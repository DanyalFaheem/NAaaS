0,PM unveils ‘foreign plot’ against his govt,Says he has credible evidence in the shape of a letter to back his claim.,"• Claims to have credible proof in shape of a ‘letter’
• Terms PTI’s performance better than all govts in 30 years
• Believes opposition lawmakers, too, will join him soon    
ISLAMABAD: In what appeared to be his ‘trump card’, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday evening revealed that he has credible evidence in the shape of a letter that an international conspiracy had been hatched to topple his government and some ‘people’ in Pakistan were being used against him through foreign funding.
The prime minister, in his much-awaited speech, then threatened the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) dissident lawmakers once again that they will have to face wrath of the nation if they voted for the no-confidence motion against him in the National Assembly. 
In his nearly two-hour-long address at Parade Ground, PM Khan claimed that not only the PTI dissents but some lawmakers belonging to the main opposition parties — Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) — would also join the government once they would know about the international conspiracy against the “independence of the country”.
Taking out a document from his pocket and waving it to the crowd and media crew, Mr Khan said he had credible evidence that his government was being toppled under an international conspiracy but he would show the documentary proof to anyone, especially the media, ‘off the record’ only.
“Foreign funding is being used to change the government. Money is coming from abroad and people inside the country are being used. Some of them are unaware they are being used and some are intentionally using this money against us,” PM Khan said while reading out a note during his speech.
He then asked the crowd “to decide will the Pakistani nation make successful all those who are conspiring [against the government] by getting money from abroad or not”. He said he was a ‘democrat’ who did not go into hiding and always went to public in difficult times.
Depending on who you believe, the crowd was something between tens of thousands to over one million — latter being claimed by the PTI leaders.
Without identifying those he was referring to, Mr Khan said he also knew the forces behind the efforts to unite the PPP and the ‘murderers’, adding that the government had been aware of the plot against it for past few months.
In a rare expression of appreciation, PM Khan admired the foreign policy of former premier and PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and said Mr Bhutto was hanged under an international conspiracy for making independent foreign policy. He said PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who always did politics in the name of his grandfather [Bhutto], joined the successors of Bhutto’s killers. “We know who have united the victim and the murderer,” he added.
The prime minister said the letter he had showed to the nation was “a credible proof” of the plot against him and offered anyone including the media to have a chat with him “off the record” on the letter. “We are receiving threats and now the nation and the media should decide that for how long we have to live like this [compromise on the foreign policy],” he added.
Mr Khan was curiously evasive when he said he was not disclosing the content of the letter at the moment and that from whom he had received it. However, he said, he would make it public at an “appropriate time”. “I am unveiling the evidence that I have before you but I am not giving details in the best interest of the country,” he added.
“I cannot tell everything to you — not because of any fear but for the best interest of the country. I do not fear anyone, but God. Nobody can give me anything. I do not need anything. I run my house by myself. I don’t have any camp office and I, after becoming the PM, saved money more than any prime minister of the past,” he said.
The premier said he had written that part of his speech [claim about the threat and letter], because he did not want to say anything in high emotions that may have an adverse impact on Pakistan’s foreign policy.
He said the corrupt leaders received threats and dictation from abroad because of their bad deeds. “Governments in our country were used to be changed with the help of our own people,” he added.
He said the country was passing through the same situation that had surfaced when former premier Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was punished and hanged for establishing an “independent foreign policy”.
At the end of his speech, the PM asked the crowd to promise that they will “never let the head of the nation bowed” before anyone. He said the country had lost 80,000 lives for becoming a US ally in the war on terror and faced drone attacks in the tribal areas that rendered 3.5 million Pakistanis homeless.
He then threatened the PTI dissident lawmakers, apparently in the opposition camp, that if they voted against him in the National Assembly, they would face the ‘worst kind of public wrath’.
“The whole nation will watch who will vote on the day of voting. I advise you do not vote on that day, otherwise people will never forgive you. If you have any differences with the government, you have only one way to quit by resigning from the party seat. But people will never spare you if your conscience awake by seeing Rs250 million,” he said, adding that whenever people would press the word ‘conscience seller’ [in their gadgets] the picture of PTI dissidents would appear.
PM Khan also claimed that he would never give the National Reconciliation Ordinance-like relief to the ‘corrupt leaders’ and said former president Gen Pervez Musharraf had committed the biggest ‘crime’ by giving them the concession.
Calling leader of the opposition in the NA Shehbaz Sharif, former president Asif Zardari and Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) head Maulana Fazlur Rehman “three stooges and rats”, the prime minister claimed he would never give them any NRO-like relief and would fight till end against the ‘corrupt’ leaders even if he was ousted.
Besides Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry, Shafqat Mehmood, Pervez Khattak and Murad Saeed, Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid and Grand Democratic Alliance leader Dr Fehmida Mirza was among the cabinet members who addressed the public on the occasion. 
The PM also recounted all his government’s achievements during the past three and a half years and said people would feel a big difference between the present and past regimes when he would complete five-year term. “I challenged that no previous government had done in past 30 years what my government has done in three years,” Mr Khan said, and referred to the project of three major dams, women’s rights, construction boom, revival of industrial sector, health insurance cards, agricultural subsidy and education reforms.
Mr Khan earlier arrived at the venue in a helicopter.

1,"With no-trust on agenda, NA begins crucial session today","Sheikh Rashid hints at further delay, says voting could take place on April 4.","ISLAMABAD: All eyes are now on the National Assembly as it is set to meet here on Monday (today) after a two-day recess, with an opposition-moved no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Imran Khan and a government-sponsored constitution amendment bill seeking the creation of the south Punjab province on its agenda.
Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told a news conference on Sunday said the voting on the no-trust motion would take place on April 4 if National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser allowed its tabling on Monday, hinting that the government could further delay the process.
Under the rules, from the day the resolution is moved, it “shall not be voted upon before the expiry of three days, or later than seven days”. The minister’s remarks show that the government will take maximum time for putting the resolution to vote, whenever the speaker allows its tabling.
On the other hand, the opposition parties have planned to hold a strong protest inside and outside the National Assembly if the speaker further delayed presenting the no-confidence motion. 

Minister hints at further delay, says voting to take place on April 4 if speaker allows tabling of motion

After the decision of Shahzain Bugti of the Jamhoori Watan Party to quit the ruling coalition, the number of treasury members has now reduced to 178 in the 342-member lower house of the parliament, whereas the opposition now enjoys the support of 163 MNAs.
The PML-Q, the Balochistan Awami Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan — the three major government allies having 17 MNAs — have yet to decide which side they are on. These parties are still negotiating with both the government and opposition parties. 
Read: Why is the PM in election mode?
Besides, over a dozen PTI dissident MNAs have already come into the open with their criticism on the government policies, indicating that they might support the opposition’s no-trust motion even at the cost of being disqualified as National Assembly members.
The speaker — who had called the opposition-requisitioned session on Friday, three days after the expiry of the constitutionally mandatory 14-day deadline — adjourned the sitting until Monday. He did not allow the opposition’s no-trust resolution to be tabled after offering fateha for the deceased PTI MNA from Hangu Khayal Zaman as per the parliamentary tradition. 
The speaker adjourned the sitting within minutes and ignored Opposition Leader Shehbaz Sharif who wanted to seek the floor to deliver a speech. Later, the opposition lashed out at the speaker for not giving floor to Mr Sharif, stating that it was also a parliamentary tradition that the opposition leader was always given the floor whenever he stood up to speak.
Venting their anger at the speaker after the session, the opposition leaders alleged that the speaker was running the parliament “like a member of the ruling PTI and not the custodian of the house”.
South Punjab bill
After the opposition members addressed the news conference outside Parliament House, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi also talked to the media and disclosed that he had submitted a constitution amendment bill to the National Assembly secretariat, seeking the creation of the south Punjab province.
It was at Mr Qureshi’s request that the speaker had immediately issued orders to put the bill on Monday’s agenda.
The move has come at a time when the PTI is struggling to win back support of its allies and dissidents within the party, many of whom happen to be from south Punjab.
Under the draft bill, the south Punjab province would have 56 seats in the National Assembly, including 46 general seats, and 119 in its provincial assembly. Creating south Punjab as the country’s fifth province was one of PTI’s election manifestos.
“Today, we have fulfilled another promise made to the people of south Punjab,” Mr Qureshi told reporters, adding that he had moved the bill on the prime minister’s directive. He urged opposition parties, including the PPP and PML-N, to support the constitution amendment bill.
A bill seeking the creation of south Punjab province introduced by PML-N’s Rana Mehmoodul Hasan and was supported by both PTI and PPP has already been pending before the Senate since January.
On Sunday, the National Assembly secretariat issued a 26-point agenda for the Monday’s sitting, which included the presentation of two ordinances, besides resolutions seeking extension in the constitutional life of three other ordinances. Interestingly, two of the ordinances have already expired.
The opposition submitted the requisition notice on March 8 under Article 54 of the Constitution and the no-confidence resolution against the prime minister under Article 95.
According to Article 54, once a National Assembly session has been requisitioned with signatures of at least 25 per cent of its members, the speaker has a maximum of 14 days to summon a session. 
However, the speaker, who had to call the lower house in session by March 22, convened it on March 25. 
In his order, he stated that a motion had been adopted by the National Assembly on Jan 21 to allow the exclusive use of its chamber for the 48th session of the Organisation of Islamic Countries’ Council of Foreign Ministers on March 22 and 23. 
He said the Capital Development Authority chairman and Islamabad’s deputy commissioner were also approached for the provision of a suitable place outside the parliament building, but “they have informed in writing that no suitable place is available at present in Islamabad”.

2,PTI chief showed ‘fake letter’: Fazl,"JUI-F chief calls PM Imran an ""agent"" of the West.","ISLAMABAD: Chief of his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday refuted Prime Minister Imran Khan’s claim of receiving threats to his government and claimed that the letter shown by Mr Khan during the public meeting was “fake.”  
Addressing a rally at H-9 sector in Islamabad where the opposition parties are scheduled to hold a public meeting on Monday (today), the Maulana called the prime minister “an agent” of the West and alleged that he had been imposed on Pakistan to meet the agenda of West and destroy the country.
The Maulana, who is also the head of the Pakistan Dem­ocratic Movement (PDM), said the participants of the PDM public meeting could hold a march towards D-Chowk in front of the Parliament House.  He, however, said that they would not do so in respect of the Sup­reme Court’s orders whi­ch had barred public gathering at Islamabad’s Red Zone.     
Talking about the prime minister’s claim that he was receiving threats and got a letter, the PDM chief said: “He [PM] waved a false letter that he was receiving threats. You are making people fool by writing false chits but no letter can save you,” he added.
The Maulana said it was the prime minister and not the opposition who was seeking an NRO.
“We are not giving you NRO. Now you are under our control. We can drag you at any square,” he added in an apparent reference to the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) that had been issued by the then military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf in 2007 to provide relief to the politicians facing corruption charges.

3,"Abolition of customs duty on crude oil, HSD imports likely",Customs duty is the only tax left on the petroleum sector after the govt gradually abolished sales tax and petroleum levy.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid rising oil prices, the government is expected to abolish customs duty on crude oil and high-speed diesel (HSD) imports to contain inflationary pressures. 
Informed government sources told Dawn that the finance and petroleum ministries, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), oil refineries and oil marketing companies were examining the proposal. Customs duty is the only tax left on the petroleum sector after the government gradually abolished sales tax and petroleum levy. 
The matter would be taken up by the upcoming meeting of the cabinet’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC).
At present, customs duty applies to the import of crude oil and all petroleum products, including diesel and petrol, at the rate of 10 per cent. Interestingly, customs duty on the import of petroleum products from China is zero under the free trade agreement with the country, and therefore oil companies tend to arrange their imports from there.
Under the proposal being discussed, customs duty on crude and HSD would be removed because of their inflationary impact, whereas petrol and other products would remain subject to import duties. Rationalising duties on imports from China is also likely to be a part of the proposal.
The sources said the government was currently paying price differential claims (PDC) on petroleum products, as the prime minister announced a cut of Rs10 per litre in petroleum products’ prices on Feb 28, along with a four-month freeze. Meanwhile, global oil prices have gone up by over 15pc since then. 
Petrol and diesel prices should have increased by Rs23 and Rs34 per litre, respectively, on March 16 based on global trend but are being absorbed with a supplementary budget of Rs32bn payment to oil companies for March alone. The finance ministry has already released Rs20bn to Pakistan State Oil (PSO) for onward payments to other companies after a verification process involving Ogra, audits and the finance ministry.
Therefore, instead of paying out of budget, the authorities have proposed abolishing customs duty on crude oil and high-speed diesel to completely and partially get rid of the PDC. This would also enable finance and tax authorities to revive the petroleum levy to mop up revenues as international prices come down because the levy is a 100pc federal tax while customs duty, despite being a federal tax, has to be shared with the provinces. 
When the prime minister announced a price freeze on Feb 28, the government estimated global crude oil prices to remain in the range of $85 to $100 per barrel over the final four months, i.e. March to June. 
However, prices have since gone beyond $120 per barrel and the rupee has depreciated to Rs182 per dollar versus Rs178 estimated at the time. 
The government had set a budget target of Rs610bn for petroleum levy during the current year but is unlikely to go beyond Rs250bn because its application on petroleum products was brought down to zero.
The government was doing well in the first half of the year in terms of revenue collections. During the first seven months (July to January) of the ongoing fiscal year, the FBR collected about Rs287bn in indirect taxes from petroleum products, an increase of 72pc over the same period last year.
Although customs duty rates remained unchanged after the government increased it from 5pc to 10pc in the budget, sales tax rates were adjusted downward on fortnightly price reviews. As a result, the government collected Rs287bn as customs duty and sales tax on petrol, crude oil, high-speed diesel and furnace oil against Rs168bn a year ago.
During the July-January period, the country spent Rs1.4 trillion on the import of the four petroleum products, which was or 120pc higher than the same period a year ago. 
Interestingly, while sales tax on petroleum products was gradually reduced, the tax on crude oil, imposed in the 2021-22 budget, remained unchanged at 17pc — a major reason for higher revenue collection on oil.
The seven-month customs duty collection on the import of these four petroleum products stood at Rs84.4bn, which was 132pc higher than the previous year. 
Likewise, the sales tax collection at the import stage on these items also increased to Rs163bn against last year’s Rs70bn. In addition, Rs40bn sales tax was also collected at the local stage, which was 35pc lower than the previous year because of a change in taxation from domestic to import stage in the budget. 
The Rs287bn revenue collection amounted to almost 9pc of total FBR taxes during the seven months against 6.7pc a year ago.
In July-January, the FBR collected Rs70bn in taxes on the import of petrol on account of customs duty and sales tax, almost Rs17bn higher than the same period last year. The customs duty collection on petrol imports was Rs36bn in seven months, almost 300pc higher than last year.
Crude oil yielded over Rs92bn taxes at the import stage, up to five times higher than last year, as the government imposed a 17pc sales tax on crude oil imports in the budget. OF that amount, the sales tax collection accounted for Rs80bn. The FBR collected over Rs59bn on the import of high-speed diesel, almost double compared to the year-ago period.

4,Imran has delivered a ‘farewell address’: opposition,"PPP says PM wants country to burn to ""save his own skin""; PML-N accuses him of having no courage to take a stand.","ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Terming Prime Min­is­ter Imran Khan’s speech at the Parade Ground on Sunday a ‘farewell address’, the opposition said there was no surprise in it as was being claimed by the ruling party for the past many days.  
PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz said PM Khan had nothing to reveal at the much-trumpeted public meeting and had no courage to take a stand. “If you (Imran Khan) had any secret, you would have propagated world over,” Ms Nawaz said in response to the prime minister’s statement that he had many a secret, but would not reveal them.  
Ms Nawaz said PM Khan was sitting silent and not speaking up because he knew several corruption cases would be opened against him that included LNG, sugar and flour scams. She also chided PM Khan for threatening state institutions, saying Nawaz Sharif would hold the institutions accountable, if he returned. “These state institutions, public and this country belong to Nawaz Sharif,” she added.  

PPP says PM wants country to burn to ‘save own skin’; PML-N accuses him of having no courage to take stand

A spokesman for Bilawal House said in a statement that Imran Khan wanted to put the country on fire in an effort to save his own skin. “He [Imran Khan] had no business even bringing Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s name to his ‘crass tongue’. What was his surprise? That he’s obsessed by Bhutto Shaheed?” said the spokesman, adding these were the rantings of an “unhinged mind”.  
“His [Imran’s] claims are bizarre, tragic-comic in fact. He has lost support in parliament and in the court of people,” he said, adding that the common man could not bear the burden of his government’s “terrible misrule”.  
“No foreign hand is needed to remove him. That is just his delusional mind speaking; cannot even be dignified with a response. Sorry to see such toxic words pollute the public discourse,” he stated.  
The spokesman said Imran Khan clearly did not understand that attacking others won’t help the country, or himself. “But he clearly is not thinking of Pakistan or it’s stability. He is willing to push the country into the fire to save his own office, but it’s obvious to everyone the game is over. In any case in democracy you have to learn to give up power. Incumbency is not for life, which seems to be the sense of entitlement in his muffled mind,” he said.  
PPP’s central information secretary Syed Nayyar Bukhari said the PTI’s public meeting was a flop show, adding that after failing to present 172 members in parliament, Imran Khan was crying. “Now, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari will not give any NRO to Imran Khan.”  
Mr Bukhari said getting funds from Israel and India was against the country and Imran Khan would face the music soon.  
PPP leader Faisal Karim Kundi said Imran Khan was using religion card after failing to give any argument over his government’s failure. “It was a farewell public meeting of ‘former’ Prime Minister Imran Khan.”  
Meanwhile, a senior leader of the PML-Q — a PTI ally at the Centre and in Punjab — said on condition of anonymity that there was nothing surprise in the prime minister’s much-talked about speech. “We don’t see any surprise [in PM’s speech]; and where’s is the ‘trump card’ he was talking about.”
