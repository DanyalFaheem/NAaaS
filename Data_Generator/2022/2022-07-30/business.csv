0,Situationer: Currency market cries out for dollars amid liquidity crunch,Greenbacks trading at 'astronomical level' in open market; LCs being opened at 'higher than' SBP-notified rate.,"Countries like Pakistan cannot imagine an economy without dollars, but the situation is heading fast in this direction and policymakers either look helpless or are simply waiting for the economy to default. This was the crux of currency market’s feelings on Friday.  
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor, while assuring the nation that the problem is being overblown, has said dollar outflows have emptied the central bank’s wallet. On July 22 alone, $754 million flew from the SBP reserves and the total further fell to $8.57 billion, which is enough only for five weeks of imports.  
July proved to be the worst month of the new fiscal year (FY23) for the local currency as it lost 14.14 per cent in value against the US dollar. The rupee has lost 26.26pc during the calendar year and 36.38pc since May last year.  
What is more important is that the calculations are based on official dollar rates reported by the State Bank, but the actual rates are much higher than the reported ones.  

Greenbacks trading at ‘astronomical level’ in open market; LCs being opened at ‘higher than’ SBP-notified rate

Anchorperson Kamran Khan in an ‘SOS tweet’ reported that Pakistan State Oil (PSO) retired a letter of credit (LC) of $64m at the rate of Rs248 via National Bank of Pakistan. It should be considered the official dollar rate, while the SBP-reported price was Rs239.94 on Thursday.  

 





 
Importers complain that the banks are charging an even higher price of dollars as the shortage has created greater space to earn profits on each dollar.  
Former SBP governor Reza Baqir was determined to interfere in the exchange rate if the situation went out of control. It was stated when the exchange rate was left at the mercy of the market. The free exchange rate was managed to some extent during the previous governor’s tenure, but the new government, under pressure from the IMF, was not ready to touch the exchange rate.  
“I don’t have official information, but our currency market believes that the government has assured the IMF of Rs250 per dollar rate, that may further rise to Rs275,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer having an experience of 25 years in the interbank market.

He said the State Bank was selling 20-25m dollars in the interbank market daily and kept the dollar rate at the desired level, but it had failed to support the local currency. The central bank usually provides $50,000 to an importer who has to manage the rest for import requirements. Only a few importers get one or two million dollars for imports, Mr Ahmed said.  
“The imports in July will surely decline. It will affect government’s income from import duties,” he said.  
Banks are allowed to manage and sell dollars at rates which are suitable to them. “With the rupee crisis spiraling out of control, the risk of a wider, more detrimental crisis through inflation, closure of factories, unemployment, law and order situation has increased. 
Time is running out for a purposeful intervention in the currency market,” said Komal Mansoor, Head of Research at Tresmark, a web-based terminal for financial markets.  
The dollar has practically crushed the local currency. Over 36 per cent appreciation of the dollar since May 2021 flooded the economy with high inflation. Both the government and State Bank have warned of higher inflation in FY23.  
For the first time after 15 days, the dollar slightly declined by 57 paisa to Rs239.37 on Friday. It was surprising for the market, but some of the currency dealers said importers had stopped opening LCs for the time being due to frequent appreciation of the dollar against the rupee.  
The open market has been selling 95 per cent of their dollars to banks, but over the last three days this process has came to a halt.  
“Over the last three days, we have not been able to sell dollars to banks since the ‘smugglers’ in Punjab and Peshawar were extremely active and most of the dollars from grey markets were smuggled to Afghanistan,” said Zafar Paracha, general secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan.  
The dollar was sold at Rs246 in the open market, while the ‘grey market’ was offering Rs255 because the dollar rate stood at Rs260 in Afghanistan.  
“I issued a press release on Thursday asking the relevant authority to stop this smuggling of millions of dollars. Today, I feel that a positive result has come out of it,” said Mr Paracha.  
He said the situation was alarming for the economy and the country, and the government, State Bank and all stakeholders should to pay full attention to resolve the issue.

1,Depreciation takes a heavy toll on stock investors,Stock investors lost 17.3 per cent of their investments in dollar terms in July.,"KARACHI: Stock investors lost 17.3 per cent of their investments in dollar terms in July — a period that saw the highest month-on-month depreciation.
The dollar-based losses in stock investments in July were the highest since March 2020, according to a research report issued by Arif Habib Ltd. The dollar rate in the local currency surged to Rs239 from Rs205 at the close of the preceding month. This translates to more than 14pc depreciation in a single month.
Financial services firm Bloomberg said July has been the worst month for the rupee since 1989 when it started tracking the local currency.
The dollar-based value of all listed shares is hovering around a 12-year low. Market capitalisation is currently $28.2 billion as the country struggles with a severe shortage of dollars amid an unrelenting political crisis.
In rupee terms, however, the loss of stock investments in July was less pronounced. The benchmark index shed 1,390.47 points or 3.3 per cent on a monthly basis, said the brokerage house. The decline was 3.6pc and 4.8pc in the preceding two months.
“As a result, domestic businesses appear anxious over the rising cost-push inflation,” it added, noting that major sectors may no longer be able to completely pass on the impact of the exchange rate movement given suppressed domestic demand amid the economic slowdown.
The average daily volume during July was 145 million shares, down 31pc month-on-month. The average daily traded value also decreased 30pc to $21m. Foreign investors bought shares worth $7.4m. 
On the local front, mutual funds and insurance companies were major sellers as they offloaded shares worth $11.9m and $8.4m, respectively. 
Last month also saw the benchmark regain some semblance of stability after the government reached a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has paved the way for the disbursement of $1.2bn, the brokerage said.
However, political instability arising out of the Punjab chief minister election once again took a heavy toll on the market trajectory. 
“Investors anxiously await the release of the IMF tranche as two more credit ratings agencies — Fitch and S&P Global — have downgraded Pakistan’s outlook from neutral to negative, reflecting the rising risks to external financing,” it said.

2,Inflation records highest-ever weekly spike,Food prices to rise further as rains damage crops.,"ISLAMABAD: Inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) increased by 3.68 per cent from the previous week mainly due to the highest-ever increase in food prices, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) data released on Friday.
The increase in the weekly inflation is the highest since the change of the base year. On June 17, the second highest increase in SPI was recorded at 3.38pc. The SPI recorded a highest-ever year-on-year increase of 37.67pc in the week under review. 
The government increased petrol and diesel prices massively which also contributed to an increase in food inflation.

Food prices to rise further as rains damage crops

The recent rains across the country have also caused damage to the standing crops as a result of which vegetables prices are likely to be stayed on the higher side amid short supplies. The massive increase in electricity tariff is another factor that contributed to the price spike.
The government has already announced in the budget that it will revive sales tax on petroleum products as well as impose a petroleum development levy in a phased manner. As a result, the price of diesel is expected to increase for next quarter. This will further increase food prices because of high transportation charges.
The government projected a modest inflationary annual target of 11.5pc for FY23 in the budget documents. 
However, the Federal Board of Revenue, which uses inflation as one of the measures to gather extra tax from consumers, has projected inflation at 12.8pc. Independent economists projected that annual inflation would be in the range of 25pc to 30pc. 
Soon after coming into power, the new government disbanded the dedicated National Price Monitoring Committee, which was led by the finance minister, while provinces were represented by provincial chief secretaries. The committee meets every Monday to monitor the prices of essential food commodities.
The PBS data shows that the prices of 30 essential food items increased during the week under review compared to the previous week.
The price of tomatoes was up 17.53pc, pulse masoor 4.18pc, pulse mash 2.87pc, pulse gram 2.46pc, pulse moong 2.02pc, vegetable ghee 2.5 Kg 1.80pc, garlic 1.69pc and rice basmati broken 1.21pc. In the non-food items, the price of electricity was up 26.11pc, LPG 7.02pc, washing soap 2.34pc and energy saver 1.03pc.
The SPI increased by 3.27pc for the lowest income group (i.e., people earning below Rs17,732 per month) and by 3.54pc for the group with a monthly income of above Rs44,175.
The year on year increase in diesel was 101.53pc, pulse masoor 99.14pc, petrol 94.15pc, chicken 75.65pc, cooking oil 5 litre 74.81pc, vegetable ghee 1 Kg 72.90pc, mustard oil 72.45pc, vegetable ghee 2.5 Kg 70.51pc, onions 64.18pc, washing soap 62.46pc, pulse gram 55.28pc, electricity 52.61pc, gents sponge chappal 52.21pc, garlic 45.18pc and pulse mash 38.35pc.
