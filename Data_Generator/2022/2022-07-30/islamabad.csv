Police detained two sisters for their involvement in the kidnapping.
According to a police spokesman, the infant, who was kidnapped from the hospital’s OPD, was reunited with his parents after being recovered during an intelligence-based joint operation on Thursday night.
Aftab Ahmad, father of Mohammad Musa, could not control his emotions when he was informed by the police that his little son had been recovered.
Aftab Ahmad, who has a nine-year-old daughter and three-month old son, told Dawn that his family was thankful to the police and media because of whom he was with his son.
He said the woman who kidnapped his son had already been convicted and sentenced to 24 years in prison in a similar case in Karachi but she was released after six years of imprisonment.
According to police, the woman who took the infant from the hospital was detained and an investigation was being carried out to ascertain the motive behind the abductions.
As part of the investigation, police with the help of CCTV images interviewed a rickshaw driver who gave a ride to the woman after she took the newborn on Wednesday from BBH.

1,Pemra told to broadcast water conservation awareness messages,RAWALPINDI: The Lahore High Court (LHC) Rawalpindi bench directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority...,"RAWALPINDI: The Lahore High Court (LHC) Rawalpindi bench directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) to broadcast water conservation awareness campaigns on national media and also instructed the Rawalpindi administration to establish a dedicated YouTube channel and disseminate relevant content for this purpose through social media platforms.
LHC Justice Sohail Nasir, deciding the petition against installation of illegal hydrants, issued multiple directions to the Rawalpindi administration, Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) and Pemra.
The court directed the deputy commissioner and Wasa managing director to provide content depicting public responsibilities in the ongoing water crisis to the Pemra chairman for their onward distribution to private television channels for broadcasting since it was the prerequisite in their licence.
Justice Nasir further directed the deputy commissioner and MD Wasa to launch a campaign to educate the public by quoting the verses of the Holy Quran and hadith on the importance of water by displaying them on billboards, streamers and banners in mosques, educational institutions and government offices.
“The deputy commissioner shall also ask the representatives of chamber of commerce, Rawalpindi to use their forum for this campaign by inviting trade unions and other sectors of society. The district education officer shall ensure that all educational institutions of the city (government and private) shall carry out effective awareness programmes through short-term lectures on alternate days in a week by inviting the volunteers relevant to the subject as well as by hosting debate competitions,” the court order said.
It further added: “The district education officer and the deputy commissioner shall launch a YouTube Channel solely dedicated to the issue. Using this platform, all the videos irrespective of rewards produced by the students shall be uploaded. The targeted contents shall also be posted, displayed and uploaded by using other platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.”
Justice Nasir said water is the best choice for hydrating the body and it is difficult to survive after a specified period in case water is not provided to a human being.
The court noted that currently, sources of water supply to the metropolitan (excluding cantonment) are from Rawal Dam, Khanpur Dam and tubewells being controlled, regulated and managed by Wasa. Right now, against the demand of 68 million gallons per day (MGD) the supply is of 51 MGD with a shortage of 17 MGD. Apparently, Wasa has no solution to cover the shortfall between demand and supply.
The court further observed that since the MD Wasa has given an undertaking of taking action against illegal hydrants, therefore, the grievances of petitioners have been addressed.
The court has entertained the petition as public interest litigation, therefore, the judge has asked the relevant quarters to play their obligatory role to counter the water crises.

3,Record of royalty tax collection contracts confiscated,MUZAFFARABAD: A police team raided the office of District Council Muzaffarabad on Friday and confiscated the record...,"MUZAFFARABAD: A police team raided the office of District Council Muzaffarabad on Friday and confiscated the record of past 11 years related to the royalty tax collection contracts.
The action was taken in the light of an FIR registered against a contractor after his arrest by the civil secretariat police from the premises of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Supreme Court on the direction of a division bench, comprising Chief Justice Raja Saeed Akram and senior judge Khawaja Mohammad Naseem.
Banaras Iqbal Abbasi, a self-proclaimed A-class contractor of Local Government Board (LGB), had filed a petition for leave to appeal (PLA) in the apex court to challenge a High Court judgement whereby his plea to restrain District Council Muzaffarabad from revoking a ‘work order’ for royalty tax collection issued in his favour on September 22, 2020, was dismissed “in the light of the record and arguments from both sides”.
On Thursday, when the apex court bench took up the PLA, it questioned Mr Abbasi’s counsel whether the ‘work order’ annexed with the PLA was genuine or fake. In response, the counsel maintained that the “respondents [District Council and LGB] had removed [the copy of] ‘work order’ from their official record with mala fide intentions.”
On being asked by the bench to explain his institution’s position in this regard, District Council’s Chief Officer Anjum Bilal Khan stated that no ‘work order’ had ever been issued in Mr Abbasi’s favour and that the one being claimed by him was fake beyond doubt.
The chief officer informed the court that Mr Abbasi had been securing the royalty tax collection contracts from the District Council for the past 11 years without any due process. Expressing anger, the bench ordered the secretary LGB to conduct a detailed inquiry into the matter, fix responsibilities and submit a report to the registrar’s office within one month.

6,Sherry makes case for equitable climate financing to address crisis,Pakistan alone needs $101bn for a smooth energy transition.,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Friday said as chair of G77+China, Pakistan would ensure that climate financial justice and losses were at the core of all multilateral negotiations at this year’s COP-27.
Senator Rehman was speaking at the launch of the Climate Finance Accelerator (CFA) programme by DAI Pakistan as the chief guest. The event was organised to provide a platform to discuss the future road map for the programme.
During her speech, Senator Rehman reiterated the urgent need for equitable and just climate financing to address the current climate crisis. 
Highlighting the climate catastrophe that Pakistan was experiencing, the minister said: “Climate change is a poster child for knowing no borders or timelines. Burning fossil fuels in one country impact a whole chain of small emitters near the equator in ways that multiply disaster outcomes for the vulnerable. There have been so many tragic monsoon casualties this month alone in Pakistan, and the weather cannot be in anyone’s control, only our responses can be optimised better.”
The world, particularly South Asia, was experiencing unprecedented climate events, with Europe and the United States experiencing extreme temperatures, she said, adding those are still 10 degrees less than what we have been enduring here. 
In terms of global collective action, though, we are all moving at glacial speeds even with the crisis knocking at our doors. There is a commitment gap for all societies and a huge fault line between commitments and their actualisation. Pakistan alone needs $101 Billion for a smooth energy transition.
The Climate Finance Accelerator (CFA) programme was a four-year programme funded by the United Kingdom Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). The CFA works with eight middle-income countries to help them achieve their national climate plans and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). 
Development director of British High Commission, Annabel Gerry said: “The Climate Finance Accelerator will build partnerships between projects, the financial community, and policymakers to help low carbon projects looking for investment. The launch of CFA Pakistan underlines the UK’s firm commitment to supporting the effort to fight climate change in Pakistan.”
CFA Pakistan’s project director from DAI, Eldana Djumalieva said: “Pakistan is amongst the top 10 countries in the world most affected by climate change. Climate action is a pressing need in Pakistan.”

7,Over 90pc communities never consulted on disaster risk management: report,ISLAMABAD: More than 90pc disaster-prone communities across four provinces observed that they have never been...,"ISLAMABAD: More than 90pc disaster-prone communities across four provinces observed that they have never been consulted and involved in disaster risk assessment, planning and implementation by state institutions.
They also noted that there existed no coherence in development policies as far as disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation was concerned.
These are the key findings of Pattan’s study on inclusive disaster risk governance – views from frontline. The project is being implemented simultaneously in Pakistan as well as in 52 countries in five continents.
Sarwar Bari, National Coordinator Pattan, presented the salient features of the study at a two-day ‘National stakeholders’ workshop on DRR and resilience’.
More than 1,700 households, 150 NGOs and 150 officials of local governments were interviewed across 15 districts of the four provinces. At least 52pc of the community sample comprised women and 48pc men.
Besides representatives of disaster-prone communities from 15 districts, chairperson of a subcommittee of the Senate for Climate Change Seemee Ezdi, Senator Fauzia Arshad, members Senate subcommittees on health, education and interior, Chairman Federal Flood Commission Ahmad Kamal, Director General Rescue 1122 Emergency Services Dr Rizwan Naseer, Director General Met Office Sahibzad Khan and others participated in the workshop.
Ms Ezdi encouraged the organisers to help improve legislation on climate change and for the involvement of women and communities in DRR.
Ms Arshad assured the participants that she would try her best as a senator to improve health education and participation of women in disaster management.
She said the state was responsible to fulfil its role to make citizens part of planning.
Dr Naseer said Pakistan has too many laws on disaster management and too many disaster management institutions and this created confusion and tensions while the country lacked effective accountability mechanism.
Mr Kamal said the country has no third tier of governance and that was the main reason for lack of policy implementation.
Mr Khan of Met Office said this year 400pc more rains had already fall. Poor and inadequate infrastructures are more responsible for destruction than rains, he observed.
Abdul Qadir of Pattan Board said hazard and people centered disaster discourse was must for the country.
Mr Bari of Pattan said for decades disaster narrative had been ‘nature’ focused. Most governments and disaster experts tend to blame unprecedented natural events for destruction.
This narrative is an attempt to hide their poor planning and governance. He suggested to have a paradigm shift on disaster narrative to improve DRR.
The study ranked five disasters as most frequent and most devastating — flooding, earthquake, diseases/epidemics, pollution, heavy rainfall. Many respondents of the study also believed poverty and inequality were disasters.

In its 14-point Code of Azadari, the TNFJ said it would not accept intervention or curbs on Azadari. “Government must fulfil promises to resolve problems related to Azadari,” TNFJ Secretary General Syed Shujaat Ali Bukhari said at a press conference.
He said the government should act on Moosavi-Junejo agreement for bringing out mourning processions and establish control rooms at the federal and provincial levels and connect them with TNFJ offices.
“Every conscientious person is grieved by the martyrdom of holy Prophet Muhammad’s (peace be upon him) grandson. Azadars must be facilitated,” he added.
Mr Bukhari demanded foolproof security for Majalis and mourning processions, ensuring cleanliness and uninterrupted supply of power.
Meanwhile, Muttahida Ulema Board, comprising scholars from different schools of thought, also issued a code of conduct for Muharram.
In a meeting held recently, the board appealed to the political and religious parties to create an atmosphere of coherence. 
Muttahida Ulema Board Chairman Hafiz Mohammad Tahir Ashrafi said not only sectarianism or faith-based armed attacks were against the principals of Islam but imposing one’s ideas on others by force was also contrary to Sharia. 
Scholars and clerics said provocation, hatred, killing and imposing ideas on others had to be controlled by the authorities. 
Meanwhile, the Islamabad administration imposed ban on deviation from any past practice of holding processions and majalis.
A notification issued by the office of Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon imposed a ban on construction of civil structure on rooftops of houses or other buildings situated on or near procession routes and storage of stones, bricks, bottles and rubbish on or near procession routes in the capital.
