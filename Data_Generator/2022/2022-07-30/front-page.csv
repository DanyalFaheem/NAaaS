0,Audio released to settle facts of ‘contested’ JCP meeting,"CJP takes ‘unprecedented’ decision in bid to end controversy created by Justice Faez Isa, Justice Tariq Masood’s letters.","ISLAMABAD: The controversy surrounding developments during Thursday’s closed-door meeting of the Judicial Commi­ssion of Pakistan (JCP) deepened further on Friday when Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial relaxed the commission’s rules and ordered the release of over-two-hour-long audio recording of the session to public.
Prompting the release of the recording were the letters issued by two JCP members — senior puisne Supreme Court judge Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq Masood — both of whom claimed the meeting had disapproved the nominations of judges, proposed by the CJP, for elevation to the top court.
But the press release issued by the apex court’s public relations officer on Thursday stated the meeting had been deferred to enable the CJP to place additional information and data about the nominations and add more names to the list for consideration, if he considered appropriate. 
On Friday, a fresh press release was issued — seemingly meant to put an end to the controversy — announcing the release of the JCP meeting audio recording. “This infighting among the judges will only bring a bad omen to the institution that delivers justice,” lamented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity, saying that in 1997, a CJP was isolated, vilified, physically assaulted and ousted. “The resemblance with today is uncanny.”
The JCP had met to consider elevation of Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rasheed Khan, Justice Shahid Waheed of the Lahore High Court, and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiq and Justice Naimatullah Phul­poto from the Sindh High Court to the Supreme Court. 

CJP takes ‘unprecedented’ decision in bid to end controversy created by Justice Isa, Justice Masood’s letters

The audio recording was released after Justice Masood, who was part of the nine-member JCP, in a letter to other commission members, including the CJP, highlighted the need for putting out factual and correct minutes of the meeting, in which details of observations and discussions of each member should be mentioned. The audio recording discussed the credentials of each nominee and the judgements rendered by them.
“The correct minutes of the meeting, if made publically, will stop needless rumours,” Justice Masood wrote in his two-page letter.
In a similar letter written to other JCP members, Justice Qazi Faez Isa had also highlighted that the acting secretary, who had attended the meeting in the absence of the JCP secretary, should immediately release this decision to the media, which would also stem unnecessary speculation and misreporting, as the meeting was held behind closed doors. It was expected that the detailed minutes would accurately reflect all that transpired.
Editorial: Supreme discontent
Soon after Justice Masood’s letter became public, a press release was issued on the instruction of the CJP, who is also JCP chairman, in defence of the version contained in Thursday’s statement, which has now been disputed by the two judges.
“A resulting controversy has therefore arisen in the print and electronic media. In these exceptional circumstances the JCP chairman has been pleased to relax the restriction under Rule 5(4) of the JCP Rules, 2010 and has directed for the audio recording of the JCP proceedings of July 28, 2022 to be made available on the official website of the apex court. The audio recording from time slot 1:29:45 to 1:38:08 contains the statement by Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Ashtar Ausaf that the matters under discussion should be deferred to frame appropriate rules. He did not assess or reject the merits of any of the high court judges proposed for appointment to the apex court. As a result, five members of the JCP supported the deferment of the meeting as reported in the press note of Thursday,” the fresh statement said.
The recording indicates the AGP did request for a deferment of the issues for the time being, but at the same time also suggested that JCP rules be framed urgently by developing a system of checking or ticking the boxes of the data provided, which will help discourage debates on issues in future so informed decisions could be made properly. In the audio tape, the AGP can be heard saying “when we talk of seniority, ability, integrity and temperament, we should also consider whether the appellate courts have appreciated their judgements or overturned them”.
The AGP had also opposed the idea of discussing nominations on vacancies that would occur next month, saying that one should cross the bridge when one reached there. He also highlighted the need to consider the input of bar about judges instead of deciding the matter of elevation in haste.
“While nominating judges we should also consider how much time they will have in the Supreme Court to decide matters,” he said, pointing out that if they had only three years, then it would not be enough.
Justice Isa, who spoke in the end after the CJP, expressed surprise that while the two senior-most CJs of the high courts could sit in the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), they were not fit to be elevated in the Supreme Court. “What an irony?” he remarked.
“What does a CJ of the high court bring to this court? [He] brings experience as a CJ. What I have learnt as CJ, I would never have learned as a judge. It is altogether a different ball game,” he emphasised.
Justice Isa also said the CJP had no unilateral power to nominate anybody. “We all are equal and can nominate and all of us carry one vote to decide. This is not about winning or losing but a question of future. You are bypassing chief justices,” Justice Isa regretted.
However after Justice Isa spoke, the CJP said: “let’s rise” and left the room, leaving Justice Isa and Justice Sardar Tariq wondering whether the meeting had ended abruptly and what would happen to the minutes of the meeting.
Read: Why transparency in judicial appointments is critical
During the meeting, the CJP also coined an idea regarding increasing the number of judges in the Supreme Court and saying that if everybody cooperated, he could approach the government for amending the necessary laws to have a couple of judges more in the apex court, especially in view of a backlog of cases. “We will be short of five judges next month and we have 50,000 cases,” the CJP pointed out.
Justice Tariq Masood’s letter
Justice Tariq Masood who gave a detailed overview on the competency, integrity and capacity of each nominees, however, disputed the facts mentioned by PRO in Thursday’s press release.
Justice Masood said he came to know through the newspapers that a press release was issued by Supreme Court’s PRO giving a totally different version of events from what actually had occurred during the meeting.
Narrating the events, the letter recalled when the meeting started on Thursday, the CJP described the credentials of his nominees and then requested Justice (retd) Sarmad Jalal Osmany – a member of the commission, for his views regarding the nominations who endorsed four nominees but disapproved the nomination of Justice Naimatullah Phulpoto.
Thereafter, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and Justice Ijazul Ahsan fully endorsed all the judges nominated by the CJP for their appointment as judges of the Supreme Court.
On his turn, Justice Sardar Masood said, after discussing the seniority principle referred to a comparative analysis of the nominated judges with superseded senior judges.
“I also recommended that Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah, who was second in seniority amongst the chief justices of all the high courts, be considered and stated that no one has raised a finger against his integrity, competency etc,” the letter said, adding he did not approve three nominated judges of the Sindh High Court and one judge of the Lahore High Court and requested that the nomination of the chief justice of Peshawar High Court be deferred.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf – who joined the meeting through a video link from the US – and Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) representative Akhtar Hussain also agreed with his recommendations.
Justice Isa also agreed with this and when he was in the middle of giving the reasons for his disapproval, when, without dictating the decisions of the commission and formally ending the meeting, the CJP stood up and left the meeting room, uttering the word ‘adjourned’. He was followed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan.

1,Cricket club disclosure haunts PTI funding case,• PML-N demands early decision in matter of prohibited funding • Farrukh insists his party did nothing wrong,"• PML-N demands early decision in matter of prohibited funding
• Farrukh insists his party did nothing wrong
ISLAMABAD: The latest disclosure about funds collected in the name of charity landing in the accounts of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has provided the ruling coalition already actively seeking an early verdict in foreign funding case with even more ammunition.
Talking to reporters after a meeting of a joint delegation of PDM, PPP and MQM with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) officials, central PML-N leader and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi also referred to the Financial Times report that investigated how the PTI accrued funds through cricket matches organised under Wootton Cricket Ltd, a company owned by Abraaj Group founder Arif Naqvi.
“It is the right of the people of Pakistan to know by taking money from whose agents, PTI has been doing politics in the country,” Mr Abbasi said.
Also, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted that the investigative report of the Financial Times was a serious charge sheet against PTI Chairman Imran Khan. He said the report exposed facts related to transfer of huge funds from prohibited sources into PTI accounts.
A report by Simon Clark — the author of The Key Man, a book exposing dealings of business tycoon Arif Naqvi, published in Financial Times reveals how funds collected through charity cricket matches were used for the rise of PTI.
The report says fees were paid to Wootton Cricket Ltd, which, despite the name, was in fact a Cayman Islands-incorporated company owned by Naqvi and the money was being used to bankroll Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, Khan’s political party. Funds poured into Wootton Cricket from companies and individuals, including at least £2mn from a UAE government minister who is also a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family.
“Pakistan forbids foreign nationals and companies from funding political parties, but Abraaj emails and internal documents seen by the Financial Times, including a bank statement covering the period between February 28 and May 30 2013 for a Wootton Cricket account in the UAE, show that both companies and foreign nationals as well as citizens of Pakistan sent millions of dollars to Wootton Cricket — before money was transferred from the account to Pakistan for the PTI”, Clark writes.
“Wootton Cricket’s bank statement shows it received $1.3mn on March 14 2013 from Abraaj Investment Management Ltd, the fund management unit of Naqvi’s private equity firm, boosting the account’s previous balance of $5,431. Later the same day, $1.3mn was transferred from the account directly to a PTI bank account in Pakistan. Abraaj expensed the cost to a holding company through which it controlled K-Electric, the power provider to Karachi, Pakistan’s largest city.
A further $2mn flowed into the Wootton Cricket account in April 2013 from Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak al-Nahyan, a member of Abu Dhabi’s royal family, government minister and chair of Pakistan’s Bank Alfalah, according to the bank statement and a copy of the Swift transfer details.
Mr Abbasi said one point upon that the meeting was held was that the prohibited funding case of PTI has been pending for the last eight years; its decision has been reserved but not being pronounced.
He explained that as per laws, if any political party received funding, it had to declare as to when, how much money it received, while no party was allowed to get funding from any foreign company.
The ex-PM said PTI founding member Akbar S. Babar had provided clear evidence in the case that the PTI pressed in every way to stop the case. “Imran Khan knows the facts of the prohibited funding case, therefore, he attacks the ECP while the scrutiny committee report revealed some facts, more facts will come out when the decision is announced, so Imran Khan is trying to pressure the ECP to stop the decision by hurling abuses and carrying out personal attacks.
He said that if Mr Khan had clean hands, he would have presented records on the first day and said that a decision should be taken and the case would have been decided in six months.
Mr Abbasi maintained that according to the available facts, PTI itself admitted that the accounts operated from outside were not known, there are at least two companies in the US whose chairman’s name was Imran Khan, the money that came to the companies was part of the record.
The records of these accounts, he noted, also contained records of funds received from companies, whether it is in accordance with Pakistan’s law to get funds from companies, funds cannot be obtained from companies as you become their agents by getting funds from them, so funding from any foreign company is not allowed.
“We have requested the Election Commission that it is your constitutional responsibility to come out with this report and take action accordingly, it is the responsibility of the Election Commission to decide the case at the earliest,” he contended.
Abbasi said that ‘if a political party is doing politics by getting money from Jewish agents or doing politics by getting funding from anyone, it is the right of the people to know, this is the issue of all of us’.
Replying to a question, he said the ECP claimed to be working on this case, as there had been various hurdles in this work in the past. “We understand our constitutional responsibilities, we will decide the case and place it before the people,” he quoted the ECP as telling the delegation.
He said the delegation told the ECP that the record was very clear and they had to decide, as courts open in the darkness of night in the country to negate their own judgements.
Mr Abbasi contended that Financial Times reported that Arif Naqvi conducted cricket matches in London for welfare work in the name of charity and received crores of rupees. His company sent more than Rs550 million to the PTI and Imran Khan’s account in Pakistan for which Mr Khan did not give any record to the ECP.
He said the money from prohibited funding was obtained and used for politics in Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik had said the entire nation awaited the ECP decision on the PTI prohibited funding case. “We request the ECP to announce the decision on the PTI’s prohibited funding. We will accept, whatever the decision is given in this case,” he said while addressing a news conference along with
Adviser to PM on Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Qamar Zaman Kaira said the constitution did not allow any party to receive funds from a foreign citizen or company. The PTI had received funds from the foreign companies and individuals, he added.
He reiterated the demand that the pending decision on the foreign funding case be announced at the earliest.
Mr Kaira said Mr Khan was criticising the CEC in order to pressurize the ECP and asked if the PTI chief was still considered ‘sadiq and amin’ and his hands were clean.
PTI did nothing wrong: Farrukh
PTI leader Farrukh Habib told a presser in Lahore that the donations received by the PTI did not fall in the ambit of foreign funding. He threw a challenge on PML-N for an audit of records of both the parties by financial experts, claiming that the PTI did nothing wrong.
He said all the funds that the party received from Wootton Cricket Ltd, a Cayman Islands-incorporated company owned by Pakistani businessman Arif Naqvi, were transferred though a bank. “All the records [related to those transactions] are available,” the party’s central deputy information secretary told a press conference after a Financial Times report revealed that Naqvi “transferred three instalments directly to the PTI in 2013 adding up to a total of $2.12m” — which were of foreign origin.
He said there was no case against Mr Naqvi or his Abraaj Group in 2012 and that the businessman had given £20 million to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and his brother, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as “bribes”.

2,Indian and Pakistani FMs avoid ‘bilateral tiffs’ at SCO,"Despite being in same room, Bilawal and Jaishankar steer clear of handshakes.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistani and Ind­ian foreign ministers on Friday toge­ther attended the Shanghai Coopera­tion Org­anisation’s (SCO) Council of For­eign Ministers’ meeting and events on its margins, but avoided handshakes.
The SCO meeting was the first multilateral event where Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and S. Jaishankar came together since the former became the foreign minister after the change of government in Pakistan in April.
Even in informal settings, for instance when the foreign ministers of SCO member countries waited for a joint call on Uzbekistan’s President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, the two foreign ministers sat away from each other.
Relations between the two neighbouring nuclear-armed rivals have been bitter for long. Islamabad had lowered diplomatic ties with New Delhi after the BJP government revo­ked the autonomous status of Indian-held Jammu and Kashmir in 2019.

Despite being in same room, Bilawal, Jaishankar steer clear of handshakes

Subsequent events in Kashmir and Hindu supremacists’ actions against Muslims in India have so far prevented re-engagement. Islamabad’s position has been that it wants normalisation, but it is for India to provide a conducive environment for that to happen.  
Foreign Minister Bhutto-Zardari, while speaking at a government-run think tank in Islamabad last month, emphasised the need to engage India. He had argued at the time that despite a “long history of war and conflict” and Indian government’s actions in Occupied Kashmir and its anti-Muslim agenda, it was not in Pakistan’s interest to remain disengaged.
But soon afterwards, the Foreign Office clarified that there was no change in Pakistan’s policy on India, on which there is national consensus.
However, Mr Bhutto-Zardari and Mr Jaishankar, in line with SCO rules and charter, neither mentioned bilateral disputes, nor accused each other. 
There is a clause in SCO charter barring member states from bringing their bilateral acrimony to the organisation’s meetings.
The Pakistani FM, in his speech at the Council of Foreign Ministers meeting, highlighted Pakistan’s perspective on important regional and international issues of concern to SCO member states. He emphasised that “shared prosperity” was essential for peace, stability and development in the SCO region and globally. 
The foreign minister also shared Pakistan’s vision for the future direction and growth of SCO which could be achieved through joint efforts to enhance greater connectivity; road/rail links within the SCO region; building network of businessmen and entrepreneurs of SCO; harnessing the potential of technology and digitalization; and removing barriers to intra-SCO trade.
About strengthening connectivity in the SCO region, Mr Bhutto-Zardari proposed the construction of railways and roads, and the opening of trade routes. He said Pakistan backs the proposed “strategy for the development of interconnectedness and the creation of efficient transport corridors.”
Pakistan is working with Afghanistan and Uzbekistan on a planned railway project. This project, if it is realised, could provide an important access for Central Asian countries to the seaports of Pakistan, and will become an important component of the transport system of the SCO region. 
The foreign minister also spoke about the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and reminded the member states about their responsibility to help the war ravaged country.
Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar, meanwhile, touched upon the challenges facing the region and expansion of the organization.
According to the FO, the SCO Foreign Ministers deliberated upon important topical issues facing the organization after 20 years of its establishment, including expansion in its membership; improvement in the mechanisms of the SCO Secretariat; and SCO’s stance on global economic and political developments and the challenges for SCO countries. 
The foreign ministers signed sixteen decisions endorsing proposals on diverse areas of socio-economic cooperation and adopted a Joint Statement on Strengthening the Biological Weapons Convention.
FM Bhutto-Zardari, on the sidelines of the conferences, also met with his counterparts from China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. 
“In these bilateral meetings, the Foreign Minister exchanged views on issues of common interest as well as matters relating to bilateral cooperation and further strengthening of political, economic and trade relations with these countries,” the FO said.

3,Man ‘killed’ in Ziarat operation shows up at presser,Says he was in jail in Iran; family earlier claimed he was on missing persons' list and killed in operation by security forces.,"QUETTA: Zaheer Ahmed Bangulzai, who was identified by his family among the five men killed in an operation launched by security forces after the abduction and martyrdom of an army officer and his cousin from Ziarat, appeared before the media at a press conference in the capital of Balochistan on Friday.
The family had earlier claimed that Zaheer was on the missing persons’ list and alleged that he was killed by the security forces along with four others in the Ziarat operation.
Belonging to the Bangu­lzai Baloch tribe, Zaheer appeared before the media along with tribal elder and PPP leader Sardar Noor Ahmed Bangulzai, at the latter’s residence. Two bro­thers of Zaheer — Khur­sheed Ahmed Bangulzai and Ghulam Haider Bang­ulzai — were also present.
The family had received a body from hospital after they identified one of the bodies as that of Zaheer. They later buried the body in the family graveyard in Mastung town, some 50km from Quetta. 
“I was in a jail in Iran,” Zaheer disclosed to the media, adding that when he returned home a few days back after his release, the family was astonished. 
“I was also astonished to learn about my supposed death in an operation as a missing person and that my family members also arranged my funeral,” he said, adding that he was very much alive and did not know how his name appeared on the missing persons’ list.
He said he did not belong to any organisation and was in the real estate business. “I went to Iran with a friend with a visa but the Iranian authorities arrested me and sent me to jail. I spent nine months in an Iranian jail,” he said, adding that the Iranian authorities blindfolded him before dropping him near Pakistan border.
Zaheer said he reached Naushki and the other day returned to Mastung where he connected with cousin and went home with him where family members were surprised seeing him alive. They told him (Zaheer) that hospital officials handed over a body to them identifying it as Zaheer Ahmed.
Khursheed Ahmed Bangulzai told the media that since his brother had been missing for quite some time, he lodged a report with police station. 
PPP leader Sardar Noor Ahmed Bangulzai told the presser that through “false and misleading propaganda”, attempts were made to show those killed in the Ziarat operation as ‘missing persons’.
“Elements who were killed during operation against those who martyred Lt Col Laiq Baig Mirza and his cousin Umar Javed Ziarat were involved in acts of terrorism,” he said, adding that attempts had been made to include the name of Zaheer Bangulzai in the fictitious list of already missing persons to make them appear as innocent citizens and divert attention from this heinous act of terrorism.
The tribal elder said that anti-peace elements were killed in the Ziarat operation and a ‘drama’ was created regarding the killing of the ‘missing persons’.
“The man namely Zaheer Ahmed who belongs to the Bangulzai tribe is not only alive but is also present with us,” he said. 
The tribal leader welcomed the formation of a judicial commission for probing the killing of the people in Ziarat operation and said the government should also form another judicial commission for inquiry into the receiving extortion from the mine owners and even mine workers by the people of banned organizations in Margat and other areas.

4,Army chief reaches out to US on ‘matter of economic security’,"Bajwa's conversation with Wendy Sherman on early release of IMF tranche reported by media; COAS, Centcom chief discuss security.","WASHINGTON: The head of Pakistan’s military has reached out to Washington to request help in securing an early disbursement of funds from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), media reports and officials said on Friday. 
In a dispatch from New York, Nikkei Asia reported that “dwindling foreign reserves” have sparked “a scramble in Islamabad to avoid a default.”
Gen Bajwa’s phone call to US Deputy Secretary of State was part of Pakistan’s efforts to avoid a default, the report added.
Foreign Office Spokesperson Asim Iftikhar, when asked about the conversation between Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, told journalists in Islamabad on Friday: “Well, I understand conversation has taken place, but at this stage, I am not in direct knowledge of the content of this discussion.”

Bajwa-Sherman conversation on early release of IMF tranche reported by Nikkei Asia; COAS, Centcom chief discuss security

When Dawn asked the US State Department for confirmation, one of their spokespersons said: “US officials talk to Pakistani officials regularly on a range of issues. 
“As standard practice, we don’t comment on the specifics of private diplomatic conversations.”


Wendy Sherman

 
Earlier this month, one of the prime minister’s advisers — Tariq Fatemi — also met the deputy secretary at her office and conveyed a similar message. Later, both sides issued separate statements, saying that economic matters were discussed in the meeting. 
The Nikkei report said Gen. Bajwa had made an appeal for the White House and Treasury Department to push the IMF to immediately supply nearly $1.2 billion that Pakistan is due to receive under a resumed loan program.
The report noted that the present Pakistani government “does not have much credibility or political capital beyond Islamabad, and faces persistent pressure from ousted rival Imran Khan.”
That’s why observers say “power lies with Gen. Bajwa, 61, an infantry officer” although he is due to retire in November after a three-year extension. 
According to the report, while Pakistan has already been granted “staff-level approval” for the loan, it will only be processed after the lender’s board grants final approval.
“The IMF is going into recess for the next three weeks and its board will not convene until late August. No firm date has been set for announcing the loan approval for Pakistan,” the report quoted an IMF official as saying. 
‘Engaged but impartial’
On Thursday, the State Department had said it remains engaged with a range of stakeholders in Pakistan, but it does not support one political party over another.
Spokesperson Ned Price said this at a news briefing in Washington where he also emphasized the US policy of supporting democratic principles across the globe.
“We remain engaged with a range of stakeholders in Pakistan. With those currently in governments, in a broad array of others, but I’m just not in a position to speak to any such meeting,” said Mr. Price while responding to a question about a reported meeting between a PTI representative and senior State Department official, Donald Lu.
Mr. Lu, who heads the bureau for South and Central Asian Affairs at the State Department, is the official blamed by PTI in an alleged conspiracy to topple their government/
“If there was any such meeting, I just not in a position to speak to it,” said Mr. Price, when asked if a PTI representative had met Mr. Lu, asking him to “forget the past and move ahead.”
Mr. Price also refused to comment on PTI’s position on this issue, saying: “What we’ve said on this before remains true.”
“We support the peaceful upholding of constitutional and democratic principles, including respect for human rights. We don’t support one political party over another. We support those broader principles of the rule of law and equal justice under the law,” he added.
Gen Bajwa and General Michael Erik Kurilla, Commander United States (US) centcom had a telephonic conversation, ISPR stated. During the call, matters of mutual interests, regional stability as well as defence and security cooperation were discussed in detail.
