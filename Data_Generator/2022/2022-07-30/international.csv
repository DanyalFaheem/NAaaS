0,Macron counts on MBS to ‘ease’ Ukraine war effects,PARIS: French leader Emmanuel Macron and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman agreed to work “to ease the...,"PARIS: French leader Emmanuel Macron and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman agreed to work “to ease the effects” of the Ukraine war, Macron’s office said Friday, after talks in Paris that marked the full diplomatic rehabilitation of the Saudi leader.
Like US President Joe Biden who visited Riyadh earlier this month, Macron had been keen to secure extra oil production from the de facto Saudi leader who was a pariah in the West until recently.
A French statement made no reference to any agreement during a dinner on Thursday night, but said the two men had agreed to “intensify their cooperation to ease the effects (of the war) in Europe, the Middle East and the world”.
The meeting outraged rights groups because of bin Salman’s suspected role in the murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018.
Western leaders snubbed the 36-year-old prince after Saudi agents killed Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul.
But the heir to the Middle East’s most powerful throne is being courted again as Europe and its allies urgently seek fresh sources of fossil fuels to replace lost Russian production.
As he left on Friday, bin Salman expressed his “deepest gratitude and appreciation for the warm reception and hospitality” in a statement posted online by the Saudi foreign ministry.
While Biden fist-bumped bin Salman as he arrived in Riyadh, Macron shook hands on the steps of the Elysee Palace as he welcomed the prince.
“He’s shaking the hand for a long time of a man whose hands are covered in blood,” senior left-wing MP Alexis Corbiere told BFM television on Friday.
Corbiere also took aim at bin Salman’s role overseeing Saudi Arabia’s military intervention in Yemen in 2015 against Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Allies of the French president defended a meeting that has been portrayed as a case study in “Realpolitik” -- putting practical needs above principles in foreign policy.
Analysts say Saudi Arabia is one of few countries worldwide with the capacity to increase its oil production, though its margin for manoeuvre is seen as limited.
“There are partners, countries that do not all share the same democratic values as France,” French Public Services Minister Stanislas Guerini, a close ally of the president, told Europe 1 radio.
“But I believe it would be a mistake to not speak, to not try to make things happen,” he added.
“French values, the voice of France, human rights, were carried last night, as always, by the president,” he added.
Oil market analysts say an August 3 meeting of the Opec oil cartel, of which Saudi Arabia is a key member, will be decisive in showing whether Western pressure for extra output bears fruit.
Amena Bakr from Energy Intelligence, a consultancy, told AFP the “most likely outcome is a modest increase or delay.” A US official told journalists on Thursday that “we’re optimistic that there could be some positive announcements coming out of the next Opec meeting.”
Macron’s decision to host the controversial royal sparked fierce criticism at home from human rights groups and left-wing opponents.
The head of Amnesty International Agnes Callamard told AFP she felt “profoundly troubled by the visit”.
The killing of Khashoggi was described by a UN probe as an “extrajudicial killing for which Saudi Arabia is responsible”.
US intelligence agencies determined that the crown prince had “approved” the operation that led to Khashoggi’s death.
Riyadh denies this, blaming rogue operatives. “I am scandalised and outraged that Emmanuel Macron is receiving with all the honours the executioner of my fiance, Jamal Khashoggi,” his fiancee Hatice Cengiz told AFP on Thursday.
The French president first hosted bin Salman in 2018, when he took his guest to an art exhibition at the Louvre Museum.

1,Israel demands UN investigators resign over anti-Semitism row,"Israel has flatly refused to cooperate with the commission, created after an 11-day war in 2021 between Israel and Gaza.","GENEVA: Israel on Friday accused members of a UN commission investigating abuses in Israel and the Palestinian territories of making and defending anti-Semitic comments, demanding they resign and disband the commission.
“It is time to disband this commission,” Israel’s ambassador in Geneva, Meirav Eilon Shahar, wrote in a letter to the president of the UN Human Rights Council that was seen by AFP.
She said she saw “no possible way” for the three members of the Commission of Inquiry (COI), which was created by the council last year, to “carry out their roles in an effective manner”.
“As such, (I) call on all three of them to resign immediately,” she said.
A spokesman confirmed that council president Federico Villegas had received the letter.
Eilon Shahar’s call follows days of outrage after commissioner Miloon Kothari was quoted alluding to a “Jewish lobby” and questioning whether Israel deserved its UN membership, reigniting long-time allegations that the council is biased against the Jewish state.
Asked in an interview published Monday by online publication Mondoweiss about member states’ criticisms of the commission, Kothari pointed to wider efforts to undermine the investigation.
“We are very disheartened by the social media that is controlled largely by, whether it is the Jewish lobby or it is specific NGOs, a lot of money is being thrown into trying to discredit us,” he said.
‘Jewish lobby’
Eilon Shahar sent a letter to the council president two days later to protest that Kothari had made “a number of outrageous comments, including some that are evidently anti-Semitic”.
Several ambassadors, including from Britain and the United States, also tweeted their outrage at Kothari’s remarks.
Commission chair, Navi Pillay, a former UN rights chief, said in a letter on Thursday that Kothari’s comments “seem to have deliberately been taken out of context” and had been “deliberately misquoted”.
She said his comments reflected the “commission’s disappointment with the continued lack of cooperation” from Israel with its investigation.
Israel has flatly refused to cooperate with the COI, created after an 11-day conflict in 2021 between Israel and armed militants in Gaza. The commission has so far largely blamed Israel as it probes “all underlying root causes” in the decades-long conflict.
Eilon Shahar said Pillay had “doubled down on the commission’s clear support for anti-Semitic comments made by Mr. Kothari”.
“It is the defence of the indefensible,” she said.
“She has endorsed anti-Semitism. She has brought shame to the whole institution.” “I expect you to take all necessary measures at your disposal to call for Ms Pillay and the other commissioners, to resign,” she wrote to the council president.

2,Gluttonous cosmic ‘black widow’ is heaviest-known neutron star,"WASHINGTON: Astronomers have observed the most massive known example of an object called a neutron star, one...","WASHINGTON: Astronomers have observed the most massive known example of an object called a neutron star, one classified as a “black widow” that got particularly hefty by gobbling up most of the mass of a stellar companion trapped in an unhappy cosmic marriage.
The researchers said the neutron star, wildly spinning at 707 times per second, has a mass about 2.35 times greater than that of our sun, putting it perhaps at the maximum possible for such objects before they would collapse to form a black hole.
A neutron star is the compact collapsed core of a massive star that exploded as a supernova at the end of its life cycle. The one described by the researchers is a highly magnetized type of neutron star called a pulsar that unleashes beams of electromagnetic radiation from its poles. As it spins, these beams appear from the perspective of an observer on Earth to pulse — akin to a lighthouse’s rotating light.
Only one other neutron star is known to spin more quickly than this one.
“The heavier the neutron star, the denser the material in its core,” said Roger Romani, director of Stanford University’s Center for Space Science and Astrophysics and a co-author of the research published this week in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.
“So as the heaviest neutron star known, this object presents the densest material in the observable universe. If it was any heavier it should collapse to a black hole, and then the stuff inside would be behind the event horizon, forever sealed off from any observation,” Romani added.
A black hole’s event horizon is the point of no return beyond which anything including light gets sucked in irretrievably.
“Since we don’t yet know how matter works at these densities, the existence of this neutron star is an important probe of these physical extremes,” Romani said.
The neutron star, residing in our Milky Way galaxy in the direction of the constellation Sextans and formally named PSR J0952-0607, is located roughly 20,000 light years from Earth, Romani said. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). The researchers studied it using the Keck I telescope in Hawaii.
Stars that are about eight or more times the sun’s mass transform hydrogen into heavier elements through thermonuclear fusion in their cores. When they build up about 1.4 times the mass of our sun in iron, that core collapses into a neutron star having a diameter only about the size of a city, with the rest blown off in the supernova explosion.
Its matter is so compact that an amount about the size of a sugar cube would outweigh Mount Everest.
This neutron star inhabits what is called a binary system, in an orbit with another star. The neutron star is a kind dubbed a “black widow,” named in honor of female black widow spiders that eat their male partners after mating.
It apparently was born with the usual mass of a neutron star, about 1.4 times that of our sun, but its gravitational pull poached material from its companion star, enabling it to grow to a mass seemingly at the uppermost limit before physics would dictate a collapse into a black hole, the densest of all known objects.
Its companion star has been stripped almost bare, losing perhaps 98% of its mass to the black widow, leaving it at about 20 times the mass of our solar system’s largest planet Jupiter — a far cry for its original size.
“It has swallowed nearly a full sun’s worth of mass without yet becoming a black hole. So it should be just on the edge of black hole collapse,” Romani said.

3,Unseasonable rains leave seven dead in UAE,The emergency services said they had answered hundreds of calls for help over the past two days.,"DUBAI: At least seven people have been killed in the United Arab Emirates after unseasonable downpours triggered flash flooding in eastern districts of the normally parched Gulf state, authorities said.
“We regret to announce that six people of Asian nationalities have been found dead as a result of the floods,” the interior ministry’s chief of central operations, Ali al-Tunaiji, said.
The ministry later announced the death of a seventh Asian migrant.
July temperatures in the UAE regularly hit 40 degrees Celsius but its east coast can also be affected by the Indian Ocean monsoon.
When torrential rain falls on sun-baked earth, it can lead to flash flooding.
The emergency services said they had answered hundreds of calls for help over the past two days as the floodwaters swamped the streets of the port city of Fujairah and other eastern districts.

4,15 dead in ‘devastating’  US state flooding,JACKSON: At least 15 people have died in Kentucky in flash flooding caused by torrential rains that swept away homes...,"JACKSON: At least 15 people have died in Kentucky in flash flooding caused by torrential rains that swept away homes and left some residents stranded on rooftoops, the governor of the US state said Friday.
“It is devastating,” Governor Andy Beshear told CNN. “Our number of Kentuckians we’ve lost is now at 15.
“I expect it to more than double,” Beshear said. “And it’s going to include some children.” “Some people’s houses were completely swept away in the middle of the night while they were sleeping,” the governor added. He said hundreds of people had been rescued by boat and there had been about 50 aerial rescues using National Guard helicopters.
With many roads washed out “we still can’t get to a lot of people,” he said.
“The current is so strong it’s not safe for some of those water rescues that we need to do.” Eastern Kentucky has had flash flooding previously “but we’ve never seen something like this,” Beshear said.
“Folks who deal with this for a living, who have been doing it for 20 years, have never seen water this high.” Some areas of the state’s Appalachia region reported receiving more than eight inches (20 centimeters) of rain in a 24-hour period.
The water level of the North Fork of the Kentucky River at Whitesburg rose to a staggering 20 feet within hours, well above its previous record of 14.7 feet.
Many roads resembled rivers, mangled cars littered the landscape and muddy brown floodwaters lapped against the rooftops of low-lying houses.
Kayla Brown, 29, and Joe Salley Jr., 56, residents of Perry County, told the Lexington Herald-Leader that the fast-rising flood waters trapped them in their mobile home.

5,Eurozone economy resilient amid inflation,"BRUSSELS: Europe’s economy is proving surprisingly resilient against soaring energy and food prices, data showed ...","BRUSSELS: Europe’s economy is proving surprisingly resilient against soaring energy and food prices, data showed on Friday, as tourism boosted France and Spain but export powerhouse Germany stalled, keeping recession fears alive.
The EU agency Eurostat said gross domestic product in the 19-country eurozone grew by 0.7pc in the second quarter, far stronger than expected by analysts. The EU as whole grew by 0.6pc.
The war in Ukraine has seen the price of natural gas and grocery items skyrocket, and Eurostat’s data also showed that inflation in the single-currency area hit yet another new record of 8.9pc in July.
Europe’s industrial powerhouse Germany continued to be the worst affected by the war, which added to the country’s woes from the continued Covid restrictions in China, a crucial export market. 
Stagnant German growth in the second quarter has led analysts across the board to predict a recession that would spill over to the continent as a whole.
Russia has sharply reduced its gas flows to Germany, raising the fear that reserves will be very low this winter and force some level of rationing that would be devastating for the economy.
The International Monetary Fund has warned that Germany, which serves as the engine of the wider European economy, is the most at risk against the war in Ukraine.
Countries reliant on tourism showed better-than-expected resilience, with growth in France and Spain gaining strength as tourists took advantage of unrestricted travel to the world’s top destinations.
The economies of France and Spain expanded from the previous quarters by 0.5pc and 1.1pc, respectively.
Nevertheless, analysts warned that the tourism boost would be short-lived and said all countries faced a huge challenge to sustain growth in the second half of the year.
“The stronger-than-expected GDP data... do not alter the fact that a deepening energy crisis, soaring inflation and rising interest rates are likely to push the region into recession later this year,” said Andrew Kenningham, economist at Capital Economics.
Italy, a major source of concern for analysts, also defied expectations by growing one per cent in the second quarter.
Italy is heavily indebted and fears of a political crisis are rife after the announced departure of Prime Minister Mario Draghi — who is seen as a steady hand by the financial markets.

6,Eight-year jail sought for Shakira,MADRID: A Spanish prosecutor is seeking a prison term of eight years for Colombian superstar Shakira over a 14.5...,"MADRID: A Spanish prosecutor is seeking a prison term of eight years for Colombian superstar Shakira over a 14.5 million-euro tax fraud case, a prosecutor’s office document showed on Friday.
The singer, who has sold more than 80 million records worldwide with hits such as “Hips Don’t Lie”, earlier this week rejected a settlement offer from the prosecutor’s office to close the case.
She is accused of failing to pay taxes between 2012 and 2014, a period in which Shakira says she did not live in Spain.
The prosecutor’s document asserts that Shakira was ordinarily resident in Spain between 2012 and 2014 and in May 2012 bought a house in Barcelona which became a family home for herself, her partner and their son born in Spain in 2013. 
It asked for an eight-year prison sentence and a fine of more than 23 million euros ($23.5m) should she be found guilty. No date for a trial has been set yet.

7,‘WAGatha Christie’ libel trial ends in defeat for devastated Vardy,"LONDON: Coleen Rooney, wife of former England soccer captain Wayne, emerged victorious in her high-profile libel...","LONDON: Coleen Rooney, wife of former England soccer captain Wayne, emerged victorious in her high-profile libel match with the spouse of an ex-teammate after a High Court judge agreed that Rebekah Vardy had leaked stories about her to the press.
In a case that has gripped the public with its mix of glamour, soccer, and amateur sleuthing, the judge backed Rooney’s public assertion that Vardy had spilled private details about her to the Sun tabloid, leaving Vardy “devastated”.
The intrigue began almost three years ago when Rooney grew suspicious about stories in the Sun and turned detective to try to find the culprit.
She said she blocked everyone from viewing her Instagram account except one person and then posted a series of false stories to see whether they leaked out, which they did.
Rooney wrote on her social media accounts that only one person had viewed the false stories, concluding with the dramatic revelation: “It’s ... Rebekah Vardy’s account.” Vardy, 40, sued Rooney and the feud was dubbed the “WAGatha Christie” case after the “WAG” moniker given to a group of footballers’ wives and girlfriends, and the renowned author of detective novels in honour of Rooney’s sleuthing.
The judge, Justice Karen Steyn, said Rooney proved her allegation was “substantially true”. She concluded that Vardy knew and condoned details being leaked to the Sun by her agent Caroline Watt.
“It was not a case I ever sought or wanted,” Rooney said in a statement. “I never believed it should have gone to court at such expense ... when the money could have been far better spent helping others,” she added.
Any decision over who foots the legal fees will be settled at a future hearing. British media have speculated the trial cost millions of pounds.
“Although I bear Mrs Vardy no ill-will, todays judgment makes clear that I was right in what I said in my posts of October 2019,” Rooney said.
Vardy said she was “extremely sad and disappointed at the decision”.

8,"US, Pakistan pressing Taliban to let girls go to school: Blinken","Kabul, Washington discuss possible release of Afghanistan’s frozen assets.","WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has identified Pakistan as one of the partners the United States has been working with to persuade the Taliban to let girls go back to school.
On Thursday, Secretary Blinken launched the US-Af­ghan Consultative Mecha­nism (USACM), which would enable Afghan citizens to communicate directly with American policymakers.
Addressing the launching ceremony, the top US diplomat said that besides Pakistan, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Qatar and Turkey, and others were also backing US efforts to convince the Taliban to reverse their decision to keep Afghan girls out of school.
The new platform — USACM — that was launched in Washington on Thursday brings together Afghan women, journalists, and at-risk ethnic and religious communities with the representatives of the US State Department. It will facilitate regular engagement with the US government on issues ranging from human rights documentation to women in Islam.

Kabul, Washington discuss possible release of Afghanistan’s frozen assets 

With USACM’s launch, “we are taking these relationships to the next level. That’s why I’m so pleased about today,” Secretary Blinken said.  He identified the group’s priorities as supporting income-generating activities for Afghan women, strategising ways to help Afghan human rights monitors safely document abuses, and devising new methods to promote religious freedom.
Afghan assets
The United States has discussed with Taliban officials the possible release of Afghan central bank’s assets frozen after the fall of Kabul in August last year, the US State Department confirmed on Friday. 
“The two sides discussed ongoing efforts to enable the $3.5 billion in licensed Afghan central bank reserves to be used for the benefit of the Afghan people,” said an official statement released in Washington. 
“The United States expressed the need to address the urgent humanitarian situation in Afghanistan” and also “underscored the need to accelerate the work on these efforts,” the statement added. 
The meeting, involving Special Representative for Afghanistan Thomas West and Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Brian Nelson, took place on Wednesday in Tashkent. The meetings took place after the conclusion of the Tashkent Conference on Afghanistan that Uzbekistan hosted on July 26. 
Media reports on the meeting claimed that the talks had made “some progress” and the US and Taliban officials had exchanged proposals for unfreezing the assets. But some differences remained unresolved. 
One of the key differences was over the Taliban’s refusal to replace the bank’s top political appointees, “one of whom is under US sanctions as are several of the movement’s leaders,” one of the reports added.
