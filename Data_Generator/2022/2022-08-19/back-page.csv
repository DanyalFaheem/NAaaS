0,Israeli forces raid offices of Palestinian rights groups,Close seven institutions and confiscate property; Tel Aviv says struck ‘third country’ during recent Gaza fighting.,"RAMALLAH: Israeli security forces on Thursday raided the offices of multiple Palestinian human rights groups in the occupied West Bank, which the state has branded “terrorist organisations”.
The military said soldiers and police officers “closed seven institutions and confiscated property” in the overnight raids.
At the Ramallah offices of human rights group Al Haq, the front door had been welded shut and a Hebrew statement left saying it would remain closed for “security reasons”.
“Any activity in this place jeopardises the security of the area, of the security forces and of public order,” said a statement.

Tel Aviv says struck ‘third country’ during recent Gaza fighting; Palestinian youth shot by troops in West Bank dies of wounds

A priest said an Anglican church on the building’s ground floor was damaged as troops sought to access the Al Haq offices. “The soldiers came into the premises around 3:00am and we started hearing shots and banging on the doors,” Father Fadi Diab of St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church said.
Al Haq is one of six Palestinian groups branded terrorist organisations by Israel in October for their alleged links to a leftist group — Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). Israel has not publicly shared any evidence of the alleged ties to the PFLP.
Israel struck ‘third country’
Meanwhile, the Israeli Military chief Aviv Kochavi revealed on Thursday that the Israel Defence Forces carried out a strike on an unnamed country during the recent round of fighting in the Gaza Strip earlier this month.
“Ten days ago, the Israel Defence Forces hit with great precision [Islamic Jihad commander] Tayseer Jabari, who is an arch-terrorist,” he said at a local conference, according to a Times of Israel report.
According to reports in the middle Eastern media, at least six Iranian and Lebanese advisers were killed on Aug 7 in Yemen at a camp run by the Houthi rebel group. The reports attributed the blast to a Houthi ballistic missile that exploded while being redeployed, according to The Times of Israel.
Meanwhile, a Palestinian shot by Israeli troops during clashes near a flashpoint holy site in the occupied West Bank died of his wounds on Thursday, Palestinian officials said.

1,Kabul mosque blast death toll rises to 21,KABUL: A blast that ripped through a mosque packed with worshippers in the Afghan capital killed at least 21 people...,"KABUL: A blast that ripped through a mosque packed with worshippers in the Afghan capital killed at least 21 people and wounded more than two dozen others, police said on Thursday.
The number of bombings across Afghanistan has declined since the Taliban returned to power last year, but several attacks — some targeting minority communities — have rocked the country in recent months, including those claimed by the militant Islamic State (IS) group.
No group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday evening’s blast at Kabul’s Sediqia Mosque, which has an adjoining madresah.
“He was my cousin, may God forgive him,” said one local resident who gave his name as Masiullah, referring to a relative who died in the explosion. “One year had passed from his marriage, he was 27 years old... he was a good person.”
Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran said 21 people were killed and 33 others wounded.
Italian non-governmental organisation Emergency, which operates a hospital in Kabul, said it had received 35 patients, including three who died.
“Most of the injuries were caused by shrapnel and burns. Our surgeons were operating throughout the night. There were nine children among the victims that we received,” country director Stefano Sozza said in a statement on Thursday.
Local hospitals contacted by AFP said they were not permitted to provide details of casualties they had treated.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan on Thursday said security was “deteriorating” in the country. “We deplore yesterday’s attack in a Kabul mosque, the latest in a disturbing series of bombings which have killed & injured more than 250 people in recent weeks, the highest monthly number of civilian casualties over the last year,” said a statement released on Twitter.

2,PTI puts off Karachi rally,"Rally postponed to Aug 26; Fawad warns of taking anti-govt drive ""beyond rallies"" if Shehbaz, cabinet don't step down.","• Party announces schedule of public meetings in 17 cities
• Will take anti-govt drive ‘beyond rallies’ if Shehbaz, cabinet don’t step down, warns Fawad 
KARACHI/ISLAMABAD: Just hours before announcing the postponement of yet another rally of former prime minister Imran Khan in Karachi, senior leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) claimed on Thursday that the party had rebuilt the recent momentum to push the ruling coalition in the centre to resign by Sept 10 and announce general elections.
They warned that if Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet didn’t step down, the PTI would take its anti-governm­ent campaign “beyond rallies and protests”.
Earlier this week, the PTI had decided to hold a series of rallies across the country, starting from Karachi on Aug 19 and led by party chairman Imran Khan himself, to mount pressure on the government to announce snap polls. However, on the eve of the planned demonstration in Karachi on Thursday, the party’s city chapter issued a statement announcing its postponement.
“Due to the ongoing weather conditions and heavy rains, the Karachi rally and chairman Imran Khan’s visit scheduled for August 19 has been postponed,” said the statement, adding that the rally will now be held on Aug 26 and addressed by Mr Khan. Previously, Mr Khan’s rally in the run-up to the local bodies polls in Karachi had been postponed last month.
Addressing a news conference at the party’s election office in the NA-245 constituency, where by-election is scheduled for Sunday, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry said: “Our current movement that includes rallies in different cities would actually go till Sept 10. If this government doesn’t resign by then and announce general elections, this [anti-government movement] will not stop here; it will go beyond rallies. And for that we will devise a comprehensive strategy.”
Flanked by former Sindh governor Imran Ismail and the party’s candidate for NA-245 Mahmood Maulvi, Mr Chaudhry expressed least interest when asked about the offer from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss a charter of economy with all stakeholders, including the PTI, and instead called for unity and consensus among political parties on “more important issues”.
He demanded an independent medical board to examine the health of party leader Shahbaz Gill. “We also request the judiciary to look into the matter as a case of hu­­m­an rights,” he said. “The Islamabad police chief and DIG should be summoned [by co­­urt] and asked who brutally tortured Shah­baz Gill. His health deteriorated and the recent PIMS report has proved he is suffering from a serious breathing problem.”
Earlier, the former minister held a meeting with the party’s Sindh chapter leaders and its candidates from Karachi for the upcoming local bodies polls in the city.
Marathon rallies in 17 cities
Meanwhile, under a well-conceived move to mobilise the masses, the PTI anno­unced the schedule for its chairman’s marathon public meetings in 17 major cities.
Imran Khan would kick off the campaign from Rawalpindi on Sunday, to be followed by Haripur on Aug 24 and Karachi on Aug 26.
According to the schedule, a rally would be held in Sukkur on Aug 27, Peshawar on Aug 28, Jhelum and Attock on Aug 29 and Aug 31, respectively. A public meeting would also be held in Sargodha and Gujrat on Sept 1 and Sept 2, respectively, and in Bahawalpur on Sept 3, Faisalabad on Sept 4, Mardan Sept 6 and Bahawalnagar on Sept 7.

According to a press release issued by the military’s public relations arm — Inter-Services Public Relations — Gen Kurilla visited the military’s General Headquarters on Thursday along with a delegation.
The press release said that matters of mutual interest, regional security situation and stability, defence and security cooperation, particularly military to military ties, were discussed during the meeting.
The one-on-one call was followed by a delegation-level meeting, the statement said.
During the meeting, the Pakistan Army’s counter-terrorism efforts and significant contributions towards regional peace and stability were discussed, while the Pak-US military training exchange programme also came under discussion.
Later, the visiting dignitary visited Army Museum, the statement said.
Earlier, Gen Bajwa and Gen Kurilla had a telephonic conversation on July 29, where they discussed issues of bilateral interest, including the situation in Afghanistan.
Gen Kurilla took charge of Centcom from Marine Corps Gen Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr. on April 1 this year.
Centcom consists of more than 44,000 service and family members overseas and nearly 5,000 personnel assigned and attached to the headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida.
It oversees the strategically sensitive region of the greater Middle East, which includes both Afghanistan and Pakistan. As the Centcom chief, Gen Kurilla looks after US military missions throughout the 21-country area of responsibility in the Middle East, Levant, and Central Asia, as well as leading the 78-nation campaign against the militant Islamic State group.

4,Registrar can’t decide on maintainability: SC judge,"""Question of maintainability of a petition or an appeal ... is solely the prerogative of the court,"" says court order.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the court’s registrar does not enjoy any power under the rules to decide about the maintainability of a petition or an appeal.
“The question of maintainability of a petition or an appeal is a justiciable issue that calls for adjudication and thus, it’s solely the prerogative of the court in exercise of its judicial power,” observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in a four-page order.
The order came after a chamber appeal instituted by Muhammad Ahsan Abid, whose petitions against two sitting ministers — one federal and the other provincial — were returned by the registrar on March 22 last year, when the PTI was in power.
The two were: federal industries minister Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar and Punjab finance minister Makhdoom Hashim Jawan Bakht.
Justice Shah ordered the court’s office to fix the main appeals — seeking disqualification of members of the national and provincial assemblies on grounds of alleged concealment of their assets — for an urgent hearing by the apex court.
The main petitions, filed under Article 63A(5) of the Constitution, were returned by the court office for not being entertainable on the grounds that an appeal under Article 63A(5) can only be filed against a declaration by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) regarding defection of a member of parliament or a provincial assembly.
Justice Shah explained that under Article 191 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure of the court. These rules simply regulate the practice and procedure of the court and are thus merely administrative in character.
The rules empower the registrar to ensure that the form and presentation of petitions or appeals are in order.
However, there is one exception in the rules under which the registrar has the power of a court in deciding certain applications in pending cases.
But this power, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah added, appears to be procedural in nature and prima facie does not impinge upon the apex court’s judicial power to decide upon substantive justiciable issues thrown up by petitions or appeals.
In the cases under consideration, Justice Shah observed, the registrar had decided that the appeals were not maintainable under Article 63A(5). But the registrar does not have the power to decide that a petition is maintainable or not, the judge stressed.
Even a judge hearing an administrative appeal against an administrative order of the registrar cannot take a decision about maintainability, Justice Shah added.
Frivolous petition
But Order XVII Rule 5 of the court’s rules empowers the registrar to refuse to admit a petition if it is frivolous, the judge emphasised.
A frivolous petition within the meaning of this rule, the order said, was limited to its form and presentation and no more. A petition whose form and presentation falls short in material particulars or which fails to refer to any provision of the Constitution, the law or the rules under which it was purportedly filed, will be frivolous, it added.
In such a case, the registrar can refuse to receive a petition unless the petitioner improves the form and presentation of the petition. The rule, however, does not vest judicial power in the registrar to adjudicate the justiciable issue of maintainability of a petition or appeal on the ground that it is frivolous, the order clarified.
Even if a petition or appeal was prima facie non-maintainable under the Constitution, a law or rules, the question of maintainability under these provisions was to be adjudicated by the court on the judicial side and not by the registrar on the administrative side, the order said.

5,Turkiye stuns markets by cutting interest rate despite soaring inflation,Central bank lowers one-week repo auction rate to 13pc from 14pc.,"ISTANBUL: Turkiye’s central bank on Thursday stunned the markets by lowering its main interest rate even as inflation soared to a 24-year high and looks set to climb further.
The central bank said “recession is increasingly assessed as an inevitable risk factor” as it lowered its one-week repo auction rate to 13 per cent from 14pc.
“Just insane — with inflation at 80 per cent and rising,” BlueBay Asset Management economist Timothy Ash remarked in an emailed comment.
“Turkiye’s central bank (has) stepped up its fight against economic orthodoxy,” Jason Tuvey of Capital Economics added in an ironic note. “The move increases the risk of yet another currency crisis.”
The Turkish lira lost one per cent of its value against the dollar within moments of the announcement. Turkiye’s monetary policy decision contradicts the approach pursued by most other countries as they try to combat the spike in consumer prices caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The war has sent food and energy prices soaring and forced central banks to raise borrowing costs — even as economic growth remains anaemic.
But Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan subscribes to the unorthodox belief that high interest rates cause inflation rather than rein it in. He has fired three central bank governors since 2019 who have tried to pursue a more conventional economic course.
Turkiye now has a real interest rate of negative 66.6pc when adjusted for inflation. This forces businesses and ordinary people to spend as much as possible before their liras lose even more value with each month.
Weak lira
Some economists interpreted the rate decision as a concerted effort by Erdogan’s team to devalue the lira in order to spur growth through cheaper exports.
Erdogan has touted this export-driven growth as a “new economic model” that a powerful and independent Turkey should pursue in order to reduce its dependence on global powers.
The lira has lost more than half its value against the dollar in the past year alone.

6,"Bereft of words at rapists’ release, India's Bilkis Bano says she’s ‘still numb’","Protest, anger spread across India over court’s decision; Bilkis Bano was gang-raped during 2002 Gujarat riots.","

ACTIVISTS holding placards shout slogans during a protest on Thursday against the release of men convicted of gang-raping Bilkis Bano.—AFP

 
NEW DELHI: Outrage and anger spread across the country on Thursday after the Gujarat government set free 11 convicts serving a life sentence for the gang-rape of Bilkis Bano and the brutal murder of her family members during the anti-Muslim pogrom of February-March 2002.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi asked pointedly if Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not feel ashamed at this kind of politics.
Women’s groups and NGOs have also appealed to the Supreme Court to rescind the decision.
Assembly elections in Gujarat are due in December, and the Congress was the ruling BJP’s main challenger in the last contest five years ago. Stirring the communal pot is never far from the politics in the state, a factor that spurred the rise of Mr Modi, a middle rank Gujarati activist of the RSS, to the country’s top job.

Protest, anger spread across India over court’s decision

The trauma of the decision to free her rapists and the killers of her three-year-old daughter is heart-wrenching for Ms Bano.
In a statement on Thursday, she said, “Two days ago, on August 15, 2022, the trauma of the past 20 years washed over me again when I heard that the 11 convicted men who devastated my family and my life, and took from me my three-year-old daughter, had walked free. I was bereft of words. I am still numb.
“Today, I can say only this — how can justice for any woman end like this? I trusted the highest courts in our land. I trusted the system and I was learning slowly to live with my trauma. The release of these convicts has taken from me my peace and shaken my faith in justice. My sorrow and my wavering faith is not for myself alone but for every woman who is struggling for justice in courts.”
Ms Bano complained that no one inquired about her safety and well-being, before taking such a big and unjust decision.
“I appeal to the Gujarat government, please undo this harm. Give me back my right to live without fear and in peace. Please ensure that my family and I are kept safe.”
The Gujarat government had released all the 11 convicts after the Supreme Court directed it to consider their plea for relief under the 1992 remission policy.
A special CBI court in Mumbai had on Jan 21, 2008, sentenced to life imprisonment all the 11 accused in the case for murder and gang-rape. Their conviction was later upheld by the Bombay High Court.
These convicts served more than 15 years in prison, after which one of them approached the Supreme Court with a plea for his premature release.
On March 3, 2002, Ms Bano’s family was attacked by a mob at Randhikpur village in Limkheda taluka of Dahod district. Ms Bano, who was five months pregnant at the time, was gang-raped and seven members of her family were killed by rioters.
Mr Gandhi on his part cited the examples of rape cases in Unnao and Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, Kathua in India-held Jammu and Kashmir and now Gujarat where the government released those convicted of rape and murder in the 2002 Bano case.



 
“Unnao — worked to save BJP MLA. Kathua — rally in favour of rapists. Hathras — the government in favour of rapists. Gujarat — the release and honour of rapists. The support to criminals displays the petty mindset of the BJP towards women,” Mr Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.
“Are you not ashamed of such politics, Prime Minister Ji,” he asked.
Discussing the release of the Bilkis Bano case convicts, senior Congress leader P. Chidambaram added that two BJP MLAs were part of the review panel that granted them remission.
“There is an interesting side story to the grant of remission to 11 persons convicted for gang rape in Gujarat. Among the Review Panel were two BJP MLAs Shri C. K. Raolji and Shri Suman Chauhan!
“Another member was Shri Murli Mulchandani who was a key witness for the prosecution in the Godhra Train burning case!,” he alleged on Twitter.
