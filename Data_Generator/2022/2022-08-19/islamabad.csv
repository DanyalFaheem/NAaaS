“Although he has asthma since childhood, it is not severe. Oxygen was being administered to Mr Gill when he was brought to the hospital. Some tests were conducted and it was found that there were some minor changes in the ECG. Although Mr Gill could have been released at that time, it was decided to retain him in the hospital as tension can lead to a sudden emergency,” he said.
The doctor said that after three hours even the ECG was perfect. Moreover, around 25 tests, including for Covid-19, were conducted and the reports were quite satisfactory, he added.
Replying to a question, he said: “initially a four-member board, headed by Dr Shajee, was constituted. The board had doctors of medicine, surgery, neurosurgery and orthopaedics. Later, a cardiologist and a pulmonologist were co-opted in the board. The board has been considering discharging Mr Gill as he is medically fit.”
However, when contacted, Director Hospital Dr Khalid Masood said that the board was fully empowered to decided about retaining or discharging Mr Gill.
“There is no interference or pressure on the board and it will take a decision considering the condition of the patient,” he said.
Meanwhile, patients suffered throughout the day at Pims as security was enhanced and leaders of PTI visited the hospital and held media talks.
Those who visited the hospital included Senators Faisal Javed, Wasim Shehzad, Shibli Faraz and Azam Swati. However, police did not allow them to meet Mr Gill saying he was on physical remand.
Employees’ protest from today
The employees of Pims have decided to protest against the MTI from today (Friday). They said all departments apart from emergency will be kept closed.
The employees’ leader Chaudhry Qamar Gujar said the hospital will remain closed till the bill, suggesting repealing of the MTI, is passed from the Senate.
Dr Haider Abbasi said that on the one hand the government has promised to repeal the MTI and on the other it was allowing the management to take decisions with impunity.

4,QAU seeks police security for vice chancellor,"Registrar requests DC to deploy Rangers at entry, exit gates after aborted attack on VC...","ISLAMABAD: Following a recent attack on Vice Chancellor Quaid-i-Azam (QAU) by a temporary employee, the university on Thursday sought police security for the VC and deployment of Rangers at the entrance and exit points of the university.
QAU Registrar Dr Raja Qaiser Ahmed wrote a letter to the deputy commissioner Islamabad requesting him for providing police security to VC Dr Mohammad Ali and deploying Rangers at the entrance and exit gates.
In his letter, the registrar stated: “It is submitted into notice that law and order situation in Quaid-i-Azam University is intensely unpleasant. The worthy Vice Chancellor on August 14, 2022 has survived an attempted assassination on the event of flag hoisting ceremony in the university premises. In this connection, it is requested to kindly provide personal security to Vice Chancellor.  The assassination attempt on VC is reflective of putrid law and order situation.”
It further said: “Your good office is again requested to deploy sufficient personnel of Rangers and police officials at the University’s entrance and exit gates for prevention of any dreadful happening.”

Registrar requests DC to deploy Rangers at entry, exit gates after aborted attack on VC

The suspect had been associated with the QAU as a paid internee against Rs10,000 per month in the Computer Science Department since 2016.
However, despite his years long efforts, he could not get a regular or daily-wage job in the university.  A university official said there was a provision to hire anyone against a regular post or on a daily wage basis without adopting the proper procedure, which is calling applications through the media.
The internee on August 14 opened fire on VC apparently to vent his anger against the university management for not providing him a job.
However, the VC remained unhurt as a faculty member foiled the attempt of the internee and grabbed his hand due to which the bullets hit the wall and rooftop of a library. Later, the suspect was handed over to the police and after two days a court sent him to jail.  Though the suspect has been sent to jail on judicial remand, the university management alleged that the police did not carry out a proper investigation.
A Joint Action Committee (JAC) comprising faculty members and employees of QAU also wrote a letter to the SSP investigation, showing their concerns. The committee said the investigation of the case was not conducted in a professional way, adding the investigation officer (IO) missed the angle of terrorism and sectarianism.
They said forensic of the cell phone and social media account of the suspect was also not been carried out.
The JAC demanded of the SSP to task a senior officer with investigating the case.
When contacted, IO of the case Fayaz Akbar told Dawn that a thorough investigation was conducted and the main reason behind the attack was found to be frustration of the highly low-paid employee. The attacker told the police that he had been getting only Rs10,000 per month for the last seven years. The IO said the suspect also said despite repeated attempts he could not get a regular job.
“The suspect has been sent to jail along with his friend, whose pistol was used in the attack. The pistol has been sent to laboratory for forensic,” he said and added that intelligence agencies also probed the matter. “We found no sectarianism in the attack,” he added.

7,Death of five tourists in flash flooding confirmed,MUZAFFARABAD: The recent cloudburst induced flash flood in Neelum Valley of Azad Jammu and Kashmir had swept away...,"MUZAFFARABAD: The recent cloudburst induced flash flood in Neelum Valley of Azad Jammu and Kashmir had swept away five young tourists from Punjab, officials confirmed on Thursday, a day after the body of one of the victims was fished out from the river.
The cloudburst had unloaded huge amount of water in Ratti Galli Nullah, some six km downstream of the famous glacial lake, between 5pm and 6pm on Tuesday, partial damaging and destroying some houses, vehicles and foot bridges along its course.
Initially, the officials had stated that five tourists had gone missing but the statement was immediately withdrawn for “having been given due to some miscommunication.”
However, on Wednesday afternoon, recovery of a young boy’s body from the Neelum River at Sandoq Syedan village and a video clip showing two persons being swept by the flooded stream persuaded the officials to revisit their earlier denial of the casualties.
“After we received the video from the villager who had shot it from his elevated house and contacted the jeep driver Amjad, who had brought the victims up to Jabba, a place ahead of which they were struck by the deluge, as well as another local resident Rustam who was also on board the same vehicle, their drowning was confirmed,” said Akhtar Ayoub, valley’s disaster management officer.
According to Mr Ayoub, driver Amjad had told his passengers at Jabba that he could not steer ahead because of the rain and bad road condition. He and Rustam also advised the visitors against going ahead through the vulnerable track amid downpour and swollen water channel and instead asked them to take another comparatively elevated pedestrian track, he said.
However, the boys dismissed the suggestion saying they would hurriedly walk towards the main [Neelum valley] road because they had to reach Islamabad the next morning, added Mr Ayoub.
In the video clip, it can be seen that as the two boys start walking through the track, suddenly huge amount of murky water gushes through the channel from behind them and sweeps them away in a wink.
Mr Ayoub identified the victims as Umair, 20, his sibling Zubair, 17, and cousin Talha Javed, 16, Akmal, 19, residents of Narowal; and Hasnaat Khattak, 20, resident of Mianwali.
Umair and Khattak were stated to be students of software engineering in Comsats Islamabad, their family members confirmed to Dawn.
They had arrived in Neelum valley on the night of August 13 to celebrate Independence Day there. Some of them had also posted pictures with green flags on their social media accounts.
Mr Ayoub said the body recovered from Sandoq Syedan village was of Talha Javed and his family members were on their way to the valley to collect it.
“We have alerted police and Rescue 1122 officials all along the route of Neelum and Jhelum rivers to spot the remaining bodies. Let’s pray we find all of them at the earliest.”

8,Experts vow to work towards granting access to sanitation for all,"ISLAMABAD: Women from across Pakistan have vowed to work together in ensuring access to water, sanitation and ...","ISLAMABAD: Women from across Pakistan have vowed to work together in ensuring access to water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) services for all particularly differently-abled people, transgender persons and people from minority communities.
This commitment was made in a national consultative workshop titled ‘Promoting Women’s leadership for Wash as a development Priority’ held here on Thursday. The speakers stressed that women and girls are disproportionally affected by poor hygiene.
Organised by WaterAid Pakistan in collaboration with the Parliamentary Task Force on sustainable development goals (SDGs), experts highlighted that appropriate sanitation and hygiene facilities eventually support business opportunities for women too and it can further women’s economic empowerment in less developed areas of the country.
Romina Alam, convener of Parliamentary Taskforce on SDGs said that women can play an important role in transforming their own and others’ lives through the availability of business opportunities in the sanitation and hygiene sector.
Arif Jabbar Khan, country director of WaterAid Pakistan said: “Lack of sanitation especially affects women’s dignity and self-respect and exposes them to gender-based violence.”
He stressed for investment in Wash by the public and private sectors as this help the country achieve multiple social, economic and climate objectives. Mr Khan also said that there was a significant gap in availability of evidence-based data related to women and Wash and one of the key reasons was societal behaviour.
He added that proper data can support policy development and its implementation in this regard.
Sana Ahmed, a participant from a Peshawar-based organisation said that there was a need for collective efforts to change this attitude of society, and eventually obtaining realistic data in health issues and economic growth of women due to lack of proper sanitation.
It was decided that civil society oranisations would work with relevant government departments for the formulation of policies. Female representatives from more than 30 civil society organisations from all over Pakistan participated in the workshop.

9,AJK govt withdraws 15th amendment bill,Bill envisaged establishment of a separate commission for local bodies elections.,"MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government withdrew the 15th constitutional amendment bill from the Legislative Assembly on Thursday when the house was to consider the report of the relevant standing committee of the house.
During the session which lasted for less than 10 minutes before being prorogued by the chair sine die, the house suspended the relevant rule on the suggestion of PM’s adviser on information Chaudhry Rafique Nayyar to pave way for withdrawal of the bill.
The bill which envisaged establishment of a separate commission for local bodies (LB) elections was tabled by the government on August 13 with the backing of the opposition Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) lawmakers.
It was seen as an attempt to technically frustrate the AJK Election Commission’s announcement to hold LB polls on September 28 in obedience to an AJK Supreme Court direction to the government to hold the long overdue LB polls by October 15.
Spelling out the aims and objectives of creating a separate electoral body of LB polls, the government had maintained that the Election Commission had announced the schedule without addressing the issues of corrections in voter lists as well as litigation and complaints regarding delimitation of wards and divisions of revenue villages and town committees. In such a situation, holding of free, fair, impartial and peaceful elections by it was next to impossible.Therefore, establishment of a constitutional body for LB elections was imperative, the government had added.
However, over the past five days, the government remained of two minds on whether it should give the green light to the amendment bill or adopt some other course to achieve its goal.
On Wednesday, the government moved an application in the Supreme Court through senior counsel Raja Sajjad Ahmed, seeking extension until March 2023 in the court’s deadline to hold LB elections.
Believing that the application would be taken up and favourably disposed of by the apex court by Thursday noon, the speaker had summoned the house at 3pm.
However, on Thursday, the court did not entertain the application and said it would do so on Friday.
In the meanwhile, in anticipation of grant of its request amid “good vibes” from the apex court, the government decided and subsequently withdrew the bill from the house.

All stakeholders must work together to make receiving an education a reality for everyone through provision of gender-inclusive facilities, quality education and development of school infrastructure. 
This was expressed by participants of an event held on Thursday as they pledged to work together towards eradicating all these barriers to girls’ education.
The event titled ‘Educating Girls in Balochistan’ was held at Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), organised by the International Rescue Committee, under the ‘Teach and Educate Adolescent Girls with Community Help’ project funded by the United Kingdom. Participants engaged in dialogue as they tried to come up with sustainable solutions to make access to education for girls in Balochistan a reality.
Shabnam Baloch, country director of International Rescue Committee said: “In order to eradicate the barrier to girls’ education in Balochistan, collaboration of all stakeholders, policymakers, practitioners, academia, and civil society is the need of the hour. 
Graham Gass, group head (health and education) British High Commission said: “The UKAID-funded Teach and Educate Adolescent Girls with Community Help programme has supported up to 29,000 out-of-school girls in Balochistan - providing accelerated learning programmes and vocational skills and helping to address the limiting social norms and barriers faced by girls in accessing quality education.”
A theatrical performance by Tekrik-i-Niswan, led by Sheema Kermani, was performed on barriers that girls in Balochistan had to face on a daily basis just to reach school. The play covered barriers like non-availability of nearby schools in the community, lack of availability of sanitation and hygiene facilities, boundary walls, and female teaching staff in schools.
Participants of the discussion concluded that such dialogues were necessary for cross organisational learning, adding that financing access to education, providing materials for learning, and creating safe spaces to learn within communities was of utmost importance.
Anne Flaker, who is director, Office of Education (USAID) said: “With an estimated 22.6 million children (aged 5 to 16) out of school,Pakistanis facing an education crisis. This is disproportionately affecting girls, who make up two-thirds of the country’s out-of-school children. 
“With so many girls not able to achieve more than an elementary education in Pakistan, USAID has made it a priority to improve girls’ education. We want to build on a long history of expanding access to high-quality education, especially for young girls in Balochistan, since we all understand how important it is for economic development, prosperity, and security that girls have access to school.”
Sher Zaman, managing director of Balochistan Education Foundation said in order to remove barriers to girls’ education in Balochistan, female teachers from the surrounding districts should be incentivised where there is significant shortage of female teachers, hindering basic operations of existing schools. He said girls and teachers who were attending school from surrounding villages should be allowed flexibility in school timing.
Quratulain Bakhteari, who is chief executive officer of Institute for Development Studies and Practices (IDSP) while speaking at the event mentioned the need to focus on adolescent girls’ nutrition and their psychological wellbeing. “Girls go through various physiological changes between the ages of 12 to 15 and it is then when we add in pressure of multiple subjects. Moreover, even if families consent to sending girls to school without female teachers, young girls require a mentor and a female figure to sensitise them on the physiological changes that they are going through.”
Ian Attfield, regional senior education adviser, Girls Education Challenge in his closing remarks shared that girls’ education had a positive multiplier effect as this will reduce child marriages, adolescent pregnancies, maternal mortality, and gender-based violence.The UK is supporting a global coalition that tackles the learning crisis by delivering foundational learning for all children.
During the event, emphasis was placed on the crucial and dynamic role of SDG 4 towards achieving the other 17 goals, which served as the cornerstone of the global commitment to ‘Leave No One Behind’.

Country head Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Malik Imran Ahmed, in a statement, said that in June 2019, the federal cabinet announced to impose additional health tax on tobacco products to save children and low-income groups by taking tobacco products out of their spending reach.
“However, prominent members from all political parties have repeatedly blocked this move,” he alleged.
Mr Imran claimed that the current excise tax on cigarettes was lower than the inflation due to which practically cigarettes became cheaper and more affordable than two years ago.
“Therefore, it is important to impose healthy levy immediately otherwise the number of smokers in Pakistan will go beyond our control,” he said.
Program Manager Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC) Khalil Ahmed Dogar said that children and low-income people were primary target of tobacco industry and unfortunately tobacco control policies were making these groups more vulnerable.
“Despite the claims of tobacco industry, its products are the leading cause of deaths due to cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and cardiovascular disease. 1,200 children start smoking daily and 170,000 people die due to tobacco induced diseases every year,” he said.
He said that the country was not recovered from financial crisis and cannot afford to lose precious funds on tobacco consumption.
“The government needs to adopt adequate measures for tobacco control and these include imposing health levy and strict implementation of tobacco control laws,” he said.
