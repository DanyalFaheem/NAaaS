0,Quetta to get Green Bus under public-private partnership,CM Bizenjo chairs first meeting of Balochistan Public Private Partnership Board.,"QUETTA: Fifteen development projects, including a Green Bus Service for Quetta, will be launched under the public-private partnership (PPP) mode in the province, the Balochistan Public Private Partnership (BPPP) Board decided on Thursday.   
At the first BPPP Board meeting, Balochistan Chief Minister, Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo gave his approval of the Balochistan Public Private Partnership Act. The Authority Rules 2022 were also approved in the meeting. 
It was decided to initially launch 15 development projects under the PPP mode. Apart from the bus service for the provincial capital, other projects include a seven million gallon per day solar desalination plant in Gwadar, development of the Hub Special Economic Zone; and 100 MW solar parks in Hub.
The PPP mode would have 12 members, including three members from the private sector. 
BPPP Unit Managing Director Dr Noor Muhammad said the development and functioning of the Bostan Special Economic Zone is also included in the 15 suggested projects, which would be implemented initially under the PPP mode along with some other projects.
Dr. Muhammad stated that passing the BPPP Act was a privilege of the current government.”The partnership between the government and the private sector is being promoted under PPP across the world and steps will be taken soon in this regard,” he added. 
CM Bezenjo said that with the promotion of PPP in Balochistan, investors from all over the world will be attracted to Balochistan for investment in different sectors. He stated that development goals cannot be met unless Balochistan moves toward self-sufficiency, and that PPP will play an important role in paving the way for the province to achieve self-sufficiency.
“To achieve self-reliance, development of own resources and promotion of investment are necessary,” the CM said, adding that unfortunately, in the past, no attention was paid towards the concept of self-reliance.
He said that it was the first government in the province to turn its attention towards the resource development and their utilisation for the development and prosperity of Balochistan. “To promote investment, the government policy should be made more comprehensive,” he said and added that by giving all kinds of facilities and incentives to the investors, their confidence will be firm and the Reko Diq Agreement is an important step towards inviting investment in Balochistan and it will attract foreign investors for investment in the province. 
The Parliamentary Secretary on Services and General Administration Bushra Rind, Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz Uqaili, Additional Chief Secretary Planning and Development Hafiz Abdul Basit, Secretary Law Akbar Harifal, Chairman Balochistan Board of Inves­tment and Trade Saeed Ahmed Sarparah, and PPP Executive Officer Rafiullah Kakar attended the meeting.

1,"Oil prices fall, but inflation stays high",LONDON: Oil prices have dropped by a quarter since June and could fall further if a nuclear deal is reached with ...,"LONDON: Oil prices have dropped by a quarter since June and could fall further if a nuclear deal is reached with Iran as it would bring more crude to the market, yet inflation remains stubbornly high.
Crude prices soared to $140 per barrel in early March after Moscow invaded Ukraine, raising fears that Western sanctions would drastically cut supplies from Russia, a major producer and exporter.
But traders are now concerned about demand due to various factors, including fears of recession, a strong dollar and weak Chinese oil imports during the country’s Covid lockdowns, said Giov­a­nni Staunovo, commodities analyst at UBS bank.
Oil prices are set in dollars, so any rise in the currency makes barrels more expensive for importers using other currencies.
In China,  “oil demand has taken a hit as processing of crude imports were weak in July” although stockpiles still rose, said Geordie Wilkes, analyst at Sucden.
The price of Brent, the international benchmark, has dropped to $95 while WTI, the main US contract, is at around $90 — and fuel prices at the pump have fallen in the United States.
But UBS expects Brent prices to climb back to around $125 by the end of the year as Russia exports fall, Chinese imports rise and Western countries stop tapping their strategic reser­ves, Staunovo said.

2,DAP import regulations irk stakeholders,Say it will not only raise the prices of the commodity but also lead to corruption and cartelisation.,"LAHORE: Fertiliser importers have criticised the government’s decision to regulate di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) import and local pricing via the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP), fearing that it will not only raise prices of the commodity but also lead to corruption and cartelisation due to a lack of competition.
“It is really a surprising decision taken on the pretext of ensuring DAP availability at the regulated price. We have also come to know that the government, while taking this decision, did not table it before the Council of Common Interest (CCI) and the federal cabinet for discussion and approval,” said Dr. Sohail Badar, a commercial importer.
”Moreover, no policy was formulated to introduce the DAP price-regulating model. None of the importers were taken into confidence before making this important decision. It is really unfair,” he added.
It may be mentioned that the country’s total DAP consumption per annum is about 2.2 million tonnes or 44m bags. The total consumption includes 80 per cent of its use for the wheat crop alone in October and November. Of 2.2m tones, 1.5m tonnes are imported each year by a total of 11 main exporters, while nearly 700,000 tonnes of DPA are locally manufactured by the Fauji Fertilizers Bin Qasim Limited (FFBL) with the import of raw material (phosphoric acid).
Under an open competition model, which continued since 1994, the importers used to import DAP according to the country’s needs by independently monitoring the international price mechanism and selling it in the local market on their own at competitive prices.
“Since we started doing this business, I have never seen any shortage of DAP in Pakistan. Moreover, I always witnessed the availability of DAP at competitive prices,” another importer said. 
He questioned the government for failing to ensure the availability of the locally manufactured urea in the past due to hoarding and smuggling issues. “Why is it trying to regulate the DAP market which never faced shortage or the price escalation issue since deregulation in 1994 to date?”
He said that, under the decision, the TCP has been assigned to regulate the DAP market price in Pakistan. However, the LCs are to be opened by the importers themselves. He said even today, the DAP price in Pakistan is lower than today’s CFR (cost of freight) price.  And this is just because of competition amongst 10-11 importers in Pakistan. 
He said the reduction in competition through regulation and consolidation of buying and pricing in one hand of TCP would definitely escalate DAP prices in the country, creating shortages and resulting in the emergence of scams in the future.

3,PM orders preparation of agriculture reform plan,"""The effects of climate change on the agriculture sector should be considered while preparing the reform plan,"" PM Shehbaz says.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif gave directives on Thursday to launch a comprehensive plan to reform the agricultural sector on an emergency basis in order to increase agricultural production, reduce imports of agricultural products and improve the livelihood of the farming community in the country.
The PM chaired a meeting on reforming the agricultural sector. The prime minister asked all concerned ministries to prepare a reform plan on an emergency basis starting from the next crop season and submit it to him within two days. 
The effects of climate change on the agriculture sector should be considered while preparing the reform plan, he directed.
The eight sub-committees formed by the PM to reform the agricultural sector, submitted their reports recommending short-, medium-, and long-term reform plans. Detailed briefings by the heads of sub-committees on wheat, cotton, edible oil, fertilisers, agricultural research, irrigation water, climate change and agricultural machinery.
The recommendations pertained to concrete measures for enhancing production of wheat, cotton, and edible oil during the next rabi and kharif seasons, besides provision of the latest farm implements to farmers at low cost, subsidy on urea and DAP, production targets with provision of exporting surplus crops, certified seeds, efficient use of irrigation water, and timely sanction of loans to farmers.
The PM said that the government would provide incentives to farmers on a priority basis. The government will ensure that farmers are provided with certified seeds and fertilisers at a reduced cost, he said, adding that the companies selling uncertified seeds and pesticides should be dealt with strictly.
PM Sharif said that the agricultural research institutions that produce quality seeds within the country would be encouraged and facilitated. The government will provide loans to farmers to acquire the latest agricultural machinery.
He stated that the government would soon take the initiative to build silos to store agricultural produce that is threatened by post-harvest climatic conditions. 
He asked concerned ministries and departments to take steps to achieve and surpass the production target for the next wheat crop. The PM said it should also be ensured that the subsidy on agricultural inputs reaches farmers.
He emphasised that efforts would be made to introduce to the farming community the best practices of agriculture in the world. A comprehensive awareness programme would be launched in this regard, he said.
Federal ministers including Tariq Bashir Cheema, Ahsan Iqbal, Marriyum Aurangzeb, Miftah Ismail, special assistants Ahad Cheema and Muhammad Jahanzeb Khan and high-ranking officials attended the meeting. The agriculture secretaries of all the provinces participated in the meeting through video link.

4,SBP reserves up by $67m,Country's total reserves at $13.613bn.,"KARACHI: Foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) witnessed an uptick of $67 million to $7.897 billion during the week ended on Aug 12, the central bank reported on Thursday.
Holdings of the banks were $5.716bn while the country’s total reserves were $13.613bn.
The weak external account of the country requires additional help to improve its reserves of the country but the new government has so far been unable to increase its reserves. The finance minister has been assuring the nation that the inflows from IMF and other resources would be resumed soon.
These assurances of the finance minister worked well as far as the exchange rate is concerned. The local currency substantially recovered from the peak of Rs239.5 to Rs213.8.
However, for the last two days the dollar halted the rupee’s recovery and appreciated by 7 paise on Thur­sday to close at Rs214.95 from Rs214.88 a day earlier.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday issued a circular regarding the business of inward home remittances.
“To facilitate the disbursement of home remittances, exchange companies are allowed to enter into agreements with the authorised dealers [banks] to act as their sub-agents for disbursement of home remittances in PKR to beneficiaries, received by banks through their international tie-ups,” said the SBP circular.
The exchange firms were advised to ensure that no home remittances-related incentive, as provided by the Government of Pakistan, shall be claimed by them for the transactions disbursed as sub-agent of a bank. 
“The ECs will also not recover any funds from remittance recipients, said the SBP. However, banks can share with ECs any part of the incentive for home remittances, as provided to them by the government.
All such transactions will be recorded by the ECs in their Core Business Application on a real-time basis; however, ECs are not required to report such disbursements to SBP, as ADs are reporting such transactions to State Bank under ITRS.

6,Pak Suzuki extends plant shutdown,Company says decision taken due to shortage of inventory.,"KARACHI: Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) has extended its plant shut down to Aug 26 from its earlier plan to keep production off from Aug 18-19.
The company in a stock filing on Thursday said the decision was taken due to shortage of inventory. PSMCL said the State Bank of Pakistan’s mechanism for taking prior approval for import under HS Code 8703 category including completely knocked down (CKD) kits vide circular issued on May 20, 2022 had adversely impacted clearance of imported consignments, thus affecting inventory levels.
The two-wheeler assembly plant would remain operative, the company said.

7,Miftah meets textile exporters,Directs relevant authorities to resolve all issues at the earliest.,"ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Thursday assured representatives of the textile industry that the promotion of export-oriented sectors was the top priority of the government.
During a meeting with the textile exporters, the finance minister further directed the relevant authorities to resolve all the issues at the earliest.
The exporters met the finance minister for the second time in the past couple of weeks to inform him about the challenges they are facing related to income tax, sales tax refunds, deferred payment claims and exchange rates.
They complained that the tax machinery had withheld exporters’ refunds to show a rise in the overall revenue collection and there were delays in the availability of subsidised loans on already approved projects.
A delegation of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association (PTEA) shared with the finance minister about the contribution of the textile sector to the economic development of the country. It was highlighted that this sector contributes heavily to exports and is effectively bringing in substantial dollars into the country.
Mr Miftah was also apprised about the various issues faced by this sector especially related to sales tax refunds which result in a liquidity crunch for the suppliers of the textile industry. 
The textile sector’s pending refunds stood at Rs35 billion on account of sales tax and Rs30bn in income tax. The tax credit amount of the textile sector is around Rs20bn.

The benchmark index opened in the green zone but profit-taking pulled it down by 286 points, said Arif Habib Ltd. Refinery and cement sectors were in the limelight.
