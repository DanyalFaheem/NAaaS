• New taxes for retailers, tobacco industry
• Subsidies exempted from GST
ISLAMABAD: In the first mini-budget of this fiscal year, the government on Thursday announced fresh revenue measures of more than Rs50 billion and lifted a ban on all non-essential, or luxury, imports to meet yet another lateral demand of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) before it clears Pakistan’s bailout package later this month.
Addressing a press conference in the federal capital on Thursday, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said Rs36bn worth of additional tax had been imposed on cigarettes and tobacco and about Rs14bn would come from changes in the retailers’ tax regime.
He said some of the other proposed tax relief measures for real estate, capital markets, banks and so on had been postponed for now.
The minister said Pakistan had completed all conditions and prior actions required by the IMF under the 7th and 8th reviews for the disbursement of $1.18bn and complied with an additional funding arrangement of $4bn from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and re-rolling of payable debt by China.
“However, the Fund wanted clarity on certain issues,” the minister said and explained that the import ban was imposed on May 19 for two months to control the outflow of scarce foreign exchange. However, the import ban issue could have been raised by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) with which the IMF worked very closely, he said, adding that this was why the Fund wanted the ban removed.
Mr Ismail said the prime minister was not in the mood to let luxury imports flow in while the government’s priority was to provide for food items and arranged imports of one million tonnes of wheat, 200,000 tonnes of urea, cotton, edible oil and pulses, which helped control prices.
Therefore, with limited dollars, Pakistan’s choice was easy to feed its 230 million citizens instead of luxury imports like Mercedes, iPhones and home appliances.
“But since this is a demand of the international community, we are lifting the ban on imports and replacing it with prohibitive regulatory duties of 400pc to 600pc so that fewer dollars be spent on luxury imports,” he said, adding that the government would impose thrice the existing regulatory duties —maximum permissible under WTO rules — on completely built units (CBUs), or finished goods.
“With my limited resources, I will prioritise flour, wheat, cotton and edible oil instead of iPhones and cars. We will remove the bans but impose prohibitive duties in the form of regulatory duties, customs duties and sales tax, so their import does not materialise,” he said.
He said the import ban was lifted to comply with IMF conditions and other international agreements while limiting imports.
The minister conceded that despite the ban, one could still find salmon and sushi in Karachi and Islamabad restaurants — which obviously could not be four months old and meant these consignments were still coming, perhaps through the green channel that the government would soon regularise with duties. The minister said these duties were not aimed at raising revenues but discouraging foreign exchange outflow.
Responding to a question, he said there would be no restrictions on industrialists importing machinery for manufacturing products for exports, or on spare parts in small quantities, but there would still be restrictions on the machinery imported to manufacture products for the local market.
On a question about imports by the manufacturers or assemblers of automobiles, cell phones and home appliances, Mr Ismail said the ministries of industries, commerce and the State Bank of Pakistan would, for some time, allow them to import half of what they used to do earlier.
“Let me get my head above the water” before getting back to normal but “we would have to remain within our means and allow imports that could be covered with remittances and exports and no more”, he said.
He said the government had also complied with power tariff adjustments and would ensure that all subsidies are funded in the budget and would also remain committed to generating Rs153bn primary fiscal surplus (the difference between revenues and expenditures excluding debt servicing).
Regarding tax measures, Mr Ismail said he had made a mistake while projecting Rs42bn in revenue through a tax on retailers as it became applicable also to very small traders consuming up to 50 units of electricity and with monthly bills of Rs1,000-2,000 and then the Federal Board of Revenue somehow slipped up and imposed Rs6,000 monthly tax instead of Rs3,000.
As a result, he said, this had to be withdrawn from the beginning, i.e. from July 1. Now, we would be able to recover Rs27bn instead of Rs42bn — a gap of Rs15bn.
The finance minister said the government would now promulgate an ordinance over the next few days to charge variable taxes to traders, starting with 5pc sales tax and 7.5pc income tax will remain in place for three months for all traders, i.e. until Sept 30.
After three months and with effect from Oct 1, this 5pc sales tax and 7.5pc tax would be on consumption of up to 50 units, after which these taxes would gradually increase for higher consumption to 7.5pc, 10pc, 12.5pc and after 1,000 units to 12.5pc and 20pc sales tax and income tax, respectively.
This Rs15bn gap was being more than filled with the imposition of Rs36bn additional tax on the tobacco industry, the minister said. The current tax of Rs1,850 per 1,000 cigarettes on tier-2 packs will be increased to Rs2,050, and Rs5,900 per 1,000 cigarettes on tier-1 packs will be raised to Rs6,500. The Rs10 per kg cess tax on tobacco is also being increased to Rs380 per kg.
Mr Ismail said the government had removed sales tax on power subsidy paid out of budget, which the FBR used to charge on the final electricity cost of about Rs22-24 per unit while the government was providing it to export sectors at Rs9 per unit. He said there was no point in charging tax on subsidies and paying it out of budget.
Now, the FBR will charge sales tax on the actual cost of units billed to a consumer and this will also be covered in the upcoming ordinance. The same principle will now also apply to gas pricing.
The minister said the issue of sales tax on agricultural machinery and implements would also be addressed.

1,PM Shehbaz renews deadline for financial aid to flood victims,13 killed in Sindh; Balochistan completely cut off from other provinces; several DG Khan areas under water.,"

KARACHI: Police and rescue personnel look for members of an ill-fated family on Thursday, after their taxi was swept away by the overflowing Malir River in the city’s Memon Goth area. The bodies of two siblings were fished out, while the search for the couple, their two children and the taxi driver was still under way.—PPI

 
ISLAMABAD / QUETTA: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday gave a ‘new deadline’ to the authorities to pay Rs50,000 compensation to each family affected by floods, after his previous three-day deadline failed to initiate the transfer of money.
In a meeting to review the damage caused by flash floods, the prime minister directed the authorities to provide cash assistance through electronic transfer to ensure that the beneficiaries get their due compensation.
He also directed the National Disaster Manage­ment Authority (NDMA) and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to carry out relief and rehabilitation activities in the flood-hit areas of southern Sindh.
He emphasised on immediate supply of food, medicines and clean water to the victims besides ensuring their accommodation.

13, including women and minors, killed in Sindh; Balochistan completely cut off from other provinces; several DG Khan areas under water

The prime minister also directed the provincial and federal agencies to conduct a joint survey for damage assessment, which should be completed in three weeks.
The meeting was further informed that the federal government was in contact with international donors and other welfare organisations.
The Asian Development Bank and the World Bank have pledged funds for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of flood-hit areas under the Emergency Disaster Relief Fund.
13 die in Sindh
A couple, their four minor children and the driver of the taxi they were travelling in drowned in flooded Malir River in Karachi’s Memon Goth area. The bodies of two two siblings were fished out, while the search was underway for the remaining members.
In another incident, a young mother drowned in Gadap Town while saving her two minor children during heavy flooding late on Thursday night.
Separately, three more people drowned while four were electrocuted in other rain-related accidents in the city.
In other areas of Sindh, more than a 100 mud houses caved in, resulting in injuries to 20 people in Larkana.
Moreover, continuous rainfall has caused flooding in several areas of Hyderabad, Dadu, Jamshoro, Larkana, Sanghar, Badin, Mirpurkhas and Umerkot districts.
Balochistan’s land links severed
Four more deaths were reported across Balochistan as incessant rain and flash floods has further deteriorated the situation in areas that were already reeling from the devastations of monsoon rains.
The total death toll in the province has touched, according to official figures.
The province’s land connections with the entire country were effectively cut off after heavy land sliding, triggered by continuous downpour, blocked Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan and Loralai-Fort Munro highways — roads connecting Balochistan to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The Quetta-Karachi and Quetta-Sukkur highways were already closed while the railway service was already suspended for the past four days.
Official sources said that mountainous areas in Sherani district and Fort Munro received downpour throughout the night.
A truck driver was seriously injured when a boulder hit the truck at Fort Munro Pass, the sources added.
Several passenger coaches and other vehicles were stranded on the two highways at different points and leading to long queues of vehicles on both sides of the highways.
Sherani Deputy Commissioner Ijaz Ahmed Jaffar said that after heavy landsliding at Zhob-Dera Ismail Khan Highway, the security forces stopped all kinds of traffic near Danasar.
In Nasirabad, over 25 villages are completely submerged and hundreds of mud houses have been damaged or destroyed, according to the local administration officials.
“Dera Murad Jamali was saved from massive destruction as flood in Lehri River was turned towards an abandoned area,” Nasirabad Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Hussain said.
He added that the Rabi canal was breached at six points and the authorities have fortified the protection dyke around Dera Murad Jamali and the movement of flood water was constantly being monitored.
DG Khan
Three mega flash floods generated by hill torrents in Sulaiman Range over the last four weeks have eliminated hundreds of human settlements and killed more than a dozen people in Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan.
Due to breach in protection dykes of Thatta-Leghari Canal, Kallarwala, Retara, Jatwala, Tibi Qaisrani, Banbhan Dona, Qaziwala, Damra, Jarh, Bhattawala and dozens of small settlements in Dera Ghazi Khan came under water.
APP adds: Pakistan Army troops continued rescue and relief efforts on Thursday in various flood-hit areas of Balochistan and Punjab, and shifted the affected population to safer places.
According to the Inter-services Public Relations (ISPR), the troops were carrying out relief activities in Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, Naseerabad and Lasbela. The army’s medical teams were also providing healthcare to affected people.

2,"Imran still MNA until NA accepts resignation, says ECP",ISLAMABAD: Rejecting the plea that PTI chairman Imran Khan is no longer a lawmaker so the Election Com­mission of...,"ISLAMABAD: Rejecting the plea that PTI chairman Imran Khan is no longer a lawmaker so the Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP) cannot issue notices to him, the ECP on Thursday adjourned till Aug 22 the hearing of a reference invol­ving the alleged sale of gifts received from foreign dignitaries by the former premier.
The argument was advan­ced by Barrister Gohar Ali Khan while appearing before a five-member ECP bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja hearing the case.
Advocate Gohar, who also sought an adjournment saying the main counsel Barr­ister Ali Zafar was unable to attend due to other engagements, recalled that PTI MNAs had resigned en masse before Shehbaz Sharif was elected as the prime minister.
The CEC, however, said Imran Khan continued to be an MNA in the eyes of the law. He said the National Assembly Secretariat was yet to accept Khan’s resignation and send it to the ECP. Stressing that constitutional matters should not be twisted to make them suitable for someone, the CEC said an MNA couldn’t be de-notified until the speaker accepted the resignation and sent it to the ECP.
“Show us which resignation the (former) deputy speaker sent to us,” the CEC remarked, referring to the resignations of PTI MNAs submitted to former NA deputy speaker Qasim Suri, adding the resignations that did get sent to the ECP were processed and the MNAs were subsequently de-notified.
The commission also directed the petitioners in the disqualification reference against former prime minister Khan to provide its copies and other relevant documents to the PTI lawyer, before adjourning the hearing till next week.
Talking to reporters after the hearing, PML-N MNA Mohsin Shahnawaz Ranjha, who filed the reference also carrying signatures of other allied party MNAs against Mr Khan for concealing details of the Toshakhana gifts and proceeds from their alleged sale, said it was time to apply former chief justice Saqib Nisar’s 2018 ruling that disqualification handed down under Article 62(1)(f) was for life.
Highlighting the allegations levelled in the reference, Mr Ranjha accused Mr Khan of getting Toshakhana gifts evaluated by his “friends” so they were undervalued and sold out. “He also did not declare those assets,” he alleged.
The MNA also alleged that Imran pressured the Toshakhana staff into declaring the value of the gifts lower than their actual cost. He also challenged Imran to file a defamation suit against him if the allegations were untrue.
In their reference, the ruling alliance MNAs included documentary evidence to corroborate their claims against the former PM and sought his disqualification under sections 2 and 3 of Article 63 of the Constitution, read with Article 62(1)(f).
Meanwhile, the ECP on Thursday reserved its verdict in the case involving attempts to remove PML-Q President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain from his party position.
Appearing before a five-member ECP bench, headed by the CEC, Advocate Umar Aslam, counsel for Chaudhry Shujaat, argued that only the Central Working Committee of the party was authorised to take disciplinary action against any office-bearer.
Shujaat had approached the ECP after a faction of the PML-Q, led by his cousin Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, held a party meeting in Lahore and dismissed both Shujaat and PML-Q federal minister Tariq Bashir Cheema from their posts in the party. The group had also announced the intra-party elections.

3,IHC ‘holds’ petition assailing ECP verdict in funding case,ISLAMABAD: While ruling out any stay order on the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) probe into the party’s...,"ISLAMABAD: While ruling out any stay order on the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) probe into the party’s funding, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday decided not to admit the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s petition seeking to set aside the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) decision in the prohibited funding case.
The IHC larger bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Aamer Farooq, Justice Minagul Hassan Aurangzeb and Justice Babar Sattar took up the petition and after preliminary hearing, decided not to admit it for regular hearing for the time being.
The bench issued pre-admission notice to the ECP for Aug 24 to decide whether or not to admit the petition.
During the hearing, the PTI’s lawyer was grilled by the bench over his plea on the ECP’s decision.
In response to the questions, the PTI’s counsel Anwar Mansoor Khan argued that the wording of the ECP’s report ‘was more like a decree’.
The federal government directed the FIA to initiate a probe into alleged prohibited funding after the ECP’s verdict, he argued.
Mr Khan expressed his apprehensions that the federal government might label the PTI as a ‘foreign funded party’ after the probe.
However, Justice Farooq remarked that the court cannot issue an order over mere assumptions.
“Even if the bench sets aside the ECP’s order, the inquiry cannot be closed,” observed Justice Farooq.
The counsel told the bench that the Supreme Court had made it clear in the Hanif Abbasi case that the federal government can not take action against political parties.
After hearing the arguments, the bench adjourned the proceedings till Aug 24.

4,Hoped establishment would ‘keep crooks out of power’: Imran,"Ex-PM urges ‘neutrals’ to reconsider their decision, says history would not forgive them","ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan on Thursday questioned the “all-powerful” military establishment for its failure to stop the “crooks” from coming into power after the ouster of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government in April while urging “neutrals” — a euphemism he uses for the establishment — to “review” their decisions.
Addressing a seminar on media freedom in Islamabad, the PTI chairman said, “I always thought our establishment cared more about this country and they would not let such a thing happen.”
The ex-PM said he had always thought the military establishment would act against corruption because throughout his struggle, the establishment and the the premier intelligence agency in particular, used to tell him about the corruption of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and the Pakistan Peoples Party. Imran Khan claimed the establishment told him how Suleman Shehbaz, son of the incumbent premier, went to China to ask for alleged kickbacks.
Mr Khan said the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) was “not in my control” and added that he could not comprehend why the incumbent rulers were not behind bars even though the cases against them were “mature”. “There was a helping hand of someone who would press the accelerator and undo it as per their wish… we would just look on and take the flak for the actions of NAB … If NAB was in my control, I would have retrieved Rs15 to Rs20 billion from them [corrupt politicians],” he claimed.

Ex-PM urges ‘neutrals’ to reconsider their decision, says history would not forgive them

The PTI chairman said everyone from army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa to President Arif Alvi knew about the US cipher and the threat made by US official Donald Lu, but “I am surprised that even when it was known that there was a foreign conspiracy [to remove Imran Khan as the PM] … and it was also known that crooks facing corruption charges were going to replace [Imran Khan] … then how were they allowed to be imposed on the country.”
The former premier said only the establishment could have stopped this because they were the “most powerful” institution and “with power comes responsibility”. “It cannot be the case that power lies with someone else and responsibility with another… authority and power are interlinked,” Mr Khan said as he blamed the establishment for not doing more.
‘Review decision’
“No matter how many times you call yourself neutral, history will blame you for what you did with the country,” Imran Khan said, adding that first things were allowed to rule the country and now there were efforts to disqualify him. The PTI chief said there was still time for “neutrals to “review their policies” as “decisions taken behind closed doors” were not always beneficial for the country. “You should review and think that there are 220 million people in this country” more than half of the population comprising youth who needed jobs.
Imran Khan said only free and fair elections guaranteed stability in the country rather than foreign loans as they would eventually translate into higher debt servicing. He said that he should not be considered “anti-American” just because he refused to provide bases to the US in Pakistan and added he had taken the decision in the interest of Pakistan.
Shehbaz, Marriyum flay Imran
In a tweet, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accused Imran Khan of “distorting facts”. “This is what self-righteousness does to you: you consider yourself holy & above reproach despite flawed conduct in office. You confuse people by distorting facts. You play mind games & insult their intelligence through deceitful ways. Niazi’s speech today was nothing but this.”
Mr Khan was also bashed by Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb who took him to the task for the “anti-media” policies during the PTI regime. In a statement shared by the state-run APP, Marriyum said Imran Khan should be arrested for snubbing the investigation notice in the prohibited funding case.
