0,"Gill, Dhawan help India cruise to 10-wicket rout of Zimbabwe","""I thought we started well but lost our way from the 18-over mark,"" Zimbabwe captain Regis Chakabva says.","HARARE: Opening batters Shubman Gill and Shikhar Dhawan starred as India recorded a comfortable 10-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the first of three One-day Internationals here at the Harare Sports Club on Thursday.
Gill (82) and vice-captain Dhawan (81) were unbeaten as the tourists knocked off a modest target of 190 with 19.1 overs to spare at Harare Sports Club.
The home side were all out for 189 in 40.3 overs, thanks largely to a brave 70-run ninth-wicket stand between Richard Ngarava and Brad Evans.
“I am enjoying batting with young Shubman and today I feel like a youngster too,” said Dhawan.
“Once I was set, I went after the bowlers. I wanted to rotate the strike as well and then accelerate.
“My rhythm with Gill has settled nicely. The way he bats and times the ball is lovely to watch. He has shown the consistency in converting 50s into bigger 50s.
“Our bowlers did well and it was nice to see Deepak Chahar come back from injury and pick up three wickets.”
Zimbabwe captain Regis Chakabva said:  “India bowled really well and put pressure on us. I thought we started well but lost our way from the 18-over mark.
“It was good to see Richie and Brad give a good partnership at the back end. They were quite good, but we needed one or two more big partnerships.
“Our bowlers tried to come hard at them but Shikhar and Gill batted really well and took us out of the game.”
Zimbabwe used eight bowlers, but none could claim a wicket as the Indian openers struck a six and 19 fours between them.
Ngarava fared worst with the ball, conceding 40 runs in seven overs, while Luke Jongwe restricted the Indian openers to 11 runs in his two-over stint.
India, third in the ODI rankings and 10 places above Zimbabwe, travelled to southern Africa without several stars, incl­u­ding Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, who are resting.
Head coach Rahul Dravid also took a break after matches in England and the Caribbean with V.V.S. Laxman taking charge.
In trouble at 83-6 after being put in to bat by India, the home side rallied with Ngarava scoring 34 and Evans unbeaten on 33.
Ngarava faced 42 deliveries and smashed a six and three fours before being clean bowled by Prasidh Krishna.
Evans also struck a six and three fours, off 29 balls, as Zimbabwe sou­ght in vain to extend a run of nine victories in 11 matc­hes since Dave Houghton became coach in June.
Former batting star Houghton inherited a team demoralised after 3-0 ODI and T20 whitewashes by Afghanistan and led Zimbabwe to series triumphs over Bangladesh in both white-ball formats.
The other Zimbabwe batsman to impress was Chakabva, whose 35 runs included four fours.
Axar Patel, Deepak Chahar and Krishna shared the Indian bowling honours with three wickets each.
Although Krishna was the most expensive, conceding 50 runs, he claimed the prized wicket of Zimbabwe middle-order star Sikandar Raza.
Pakistan-born Raza, who scored unbeaten centuries in two of his three ODI innings against Bangladesh, had scored just 12 when he was caught by Dhawan in the slips.

Pakistan captain Babar Azam, the world’s top-ranked ODI batsman, scored 57 off 65 balls before Rizwan and Salman led the tourists home in their pursuit of 187 with 16.2 overs to spare.
Dutch seamer Vivian Kingma removed openers Fakhar Zaman and Imam-ul-Haq cheaply as Pakistan stuttered early, but Babar and Rizwan steadied the innings before Salman finished it off by blasting his first ODI fifty.
Fakhar, who made 109 in the first ODI, was caught and bowled by Kingma for three and Imam was lured into a loose drive four balls later to reduce Pakistan to 11-2.
Babar passed fifty for the 38th time in 89 ODI innings but top-edged off-spinner Aryan Dutt to Bas de Leede at mid-wicket, ending an 88-run stand with wicket-keeper Rizwan.
Rizwan adopted a relatively cautious approach as he compiled 69 off 82 deliveries, in contrast to the fireworks of Salman, who clubbed the final ball of the match for six to finish 50 not out in just his second ODI.
“We are trying different combinations and Salman in his second match has showed his class,” said Babar.
Haris Rauf and Mohammad Nawaz took three wickets apiece to dismiss the Netherlands for 186.
“The fast bowlers bowled very well in the first 10 overs and took wickets and later on spinners Shadab [Khan] and Nawaz bowled very well and took wickets,” added Babar.
De Leede (89) and Tom Cooper (66) struck battling half-centuries to lift the Dutch from 8-3 but only one other batsman passed double figures for the hosts on a challenging pitch.
Naseem Shah removed Vikramjit Singh in the second over as the teenage opener edged behind and Max O’Dowd followed when he drove Haris straight to Babar at mid-off.
The 38-year-old Wesley Barresi was bowled by Naseem for three, two days after scoring just two in his first international innings since 2019.
De Leede and Cooper set about restoring order and put on 109 for the fourth wicket.
Cooper hit seven fours and two sixes before falling for 66 when he offered left-arm spinner Nawaz a simple return catch.
His dismissal precipitated the loss of three quick wickets, with captain Scott Edwards caught behind off Nawaz for five and Teja Nidamanuru going in the same manner without scoring after glancing Haris down the legside.
Logan van Beek holed out to Naseem on the long-off boundary for 13 to give Shadab Khan his first wicket.
Tim Pringle went for a second straight duck after Moha­­m­mad Wasim pinned him leg before and Nawaz claimed his third scalp by sneaking one past the defence of Dutt.
De Leede was last man out for 89, caught by Fakhar trying to clear long-on as Haris finished with 3-16 after wrapping up the Dutch innings in 44.1 overs.
“We just couldn’t get going in the lower order,” said Edwards. “It’s disappointing to probably hand a few wickets away throughout the innings. I think there’s a lot of positives still to take.”
Pakistan won the first match by 16 runs. The series finale is scheduled for Sunday at the same venue.

2,Khokhar set to retain post of president in PHF elections,"The PHF has picked Karachi as the venue for the elections while overlooking Lahore, its own headquarters.","LAHORE: Retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar is set to retain the post of president when the elections of the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) are held in Karachi today with no observer from the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) due to the ongoing tussle between the two sports organisations.
In July, the PSB de-notified Brig Khokhar along with three more PHF officials  for  failing to meet the deadline for the federation’s elections  which were due in May this year. The country’s sports governing body, during July, also appointed a four-member committee to hold the elections within 30 days.
Ignoring both the moves, Brig Khokhar took a firm stand to  hold the elections according to PHF constitution. He also appointed  Karachi Hockey Association (KHA) secretary Syed Haider Hussain, who is  also a PHF council member, as the federation’s secretary in place of  Asif Bajwa. It is likely Haider may be elected as the secretary. 
Interestingly, the PHF picked Karachi as the venue for the elections while overlooking Lahore, its own headquarters, because the district level elections in Lahore were not held due to the protest of many clubs there against the process which was followed for scrutinising the clubs.
In Karachi, the PHF has its own Abdul Sattar Edhi  Hockey Stadium and the support of Shehla Raza, a key figure of Sindh government, who has facilitated the Sindh Hockey Associ­ation in different spheres.
However, the worrying aspect of the situation is that the PHF elections are being held against the consent of the federal government.
During the last four years, the Sindh government supported the PHF while allotting a huge amount of Rs1.50 billion for renovating the Abdul Sattar Edhi Hockey Stadium. Sources said a major part of the sanctioned amount (Rs870 million) had already been released for the venue’s renovation.
Sources close to the PHF elections said the renovation of the stadium in Karachi was also an attraction for Brig Khokhar — who has remained at the helm of PHF since 2015 — to contest the elections for the next term. With financial backing from the Sindh government he could run the PHF without the federal government’s support, sources added.
Here it may be mentioned that the prime minister has been the patron-in-chief of the PHF and due to this the federal government in the past granted billions of rupees to the federation.
The federal government on Wednesday received a recommendation of the Natio­nal Assembly’s Stan­ding Com­m­ittee on Inter-provincial Co­or­d­­i­nation to conduct the audit of PHF accounts of the last eight years, during which Brig Khokhar remained the federation’s president.
This move by the government seems to have been made to grill Khokhar, instead of  interfering in the PHF affairs by holding its elections which could persuade the International Hockey Federation (FIH) to suspend Pakistan’s membership.
As the first step the PSB tried to convince Brig Khokhar to leave the offices but he went against the advice and decided to contest the elections for a full term of four years as his first three-year tenure started after then PHF president Akhtar Rasool stepped down because he had lost the confidence of then prime minister Nawaz Sharif who was willing to bring in Brig Khokhar.
Meanwhile, the newly-elected representatives of the Punjab Hockey Association left Lahore for Karachi, by bus, to participate in the PHF elections.

SOUTH African opener Sarel Erwee stops his batting partner from taking a run during the first Test against England at Lord’s on Thursday.—Reuters

 
LONDON: Sarel Erwee guided South Africa to within sight of a first-innings lead in the first Test against England at Lord’s on Thursday.
Erwee’s 60 not out was the cornerstone of the Proteas’ 158-2 at tea on the second day, a deficit of just seven runs after England had been bundled out for a mere 165.
Aiden Markram was in fine touch, his 16 not out featuring three elegant fours off Matthew Potts, James Anderson and spinner Jack Leach.
South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada did the bulk of the damage in England’s innings, returning figures of 5-52 -- the 12th time he has taken five wickets in a Test innings.
Ollie Pope’s 73 was the only double-figure score by a specialist England batsman, with the next-best contribution coming from captain and all-rounder Ben Stokes, who made 20.
South Africa captain Dean Elgar and fellow opener Erwee both scored briskly, without taking undue risks, against an England attack that lacked both the pace and accuracy of their opponents’ four quicks.
Elgar, however, was dropped on seven when he edged Potts, only for Zak Crawley to spill a head-high slip catch.
Elgar, punishing anything loose, was largely untroubled from then on until, having made 47, he fell in freak fashion when a ball from 40-year-old Anderson defl­ected off his thigh guard and forearm before trickling onto the stumps. His exit left South Africa 85-1.
New batsman Keegan Petersen got off the mark by stylishly whipping Anderson legside for a well-struck boundary.
The 32-year-old Erwee reached just his second fifty in his short Test career when he struck Stuart Broad through the covers for a sixth four in 89 balls faced.
But he nearly ran himself out soon afterwards when, going for a quick legside single, he was well short of his ground only for Broad to miss with a shy at the non-striker’s stumps.
England did have a second wicket when Potts had Petersen (24) edging to Jonny Bairstow at third slip.
ENGLAND DISMISSED
England resumed Thursday on 116-6, with Pope 61 not out and Broad unbeaten on nought, only to be all before lunch.
Rabada polished off the tail after he had sparked a collapse on Wednesday’s rain-shortened first day by removing openers Alex Lees and Crawley.
England have won all four of their Tests under their new leadership pairing of Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum after switching to a mode of all-out attack.
But the policy did not work against a quality attack that has helped South Africa climb to the top of the World Test Cham­pionship table.
Pope should have been out for 67 when he edged Rabada straight to first slip, only for Erwee to floor a routine chance despite four juggled attempts to keep hold of the ball.
Rabada then got the wicket he deserved when Pope chopped on to a full-length ball for 73 to end a 102-ball innings, leaving England 134-7.
And he showed there was more to his game than sheer speed when he undid Broad (15) with a clever slower ball that the tailender lobbed to Elgar at point.
Rabada ended the innings when he had Anderson lbw for a duck to earn a place on the coveted honours board at Lord’s.

4,Kohli opens up about mental health struggle,"NEW DELHI: Indian cricket superstar Virat Kohli, who took his team to unprecedented heights, says he has struggled...","NEW DELHI: Indian cricket superstar Virat Kohli, who took his team to unprecedented heights, says he has struggled with his mental health throughout his career, local media reported on Thursday.
The 33-year-old ex-captain built a reputation for in-your-face aggression and exemplary batting, leading his team to the top of the five-day rankings. But the man dubbed  “King” Kohli has been plagued by a run of poor form and has been relieved of his captaincy of all formats since late last year after a dismal showing at the Twenty20 World Cup.
Kohli told The Indian Express newspaper that the pressure of his career had at times had a negative impact on his mental health. “I personally have experienced times when even in a room full of people who support and love me, I felt alone, and I am sure that this is a feeling that a lot of people can relate to,” Kohli said in an interview published on Wednesday. “It is definitely a serious issue and as much as we try to be strong at all times, it can tear you apart.”
Kohli said it was important for athletes to rest and recover from the pressures of sport and reconnect with their  “core self”. “If you lose that connection, it wouldn’t take very long for other things to crumble around you.”

5,"World Cup ticket sales approach 2.5 million, says FIFA",The cheapest tickets for fans from outside Qatar are priced at 250 riyals.,"DOHA: A total of 2.45 million tickets have been sold for this year’s World Cup in Qatar after over half a million were snapped up in the latest sales period, world football governing body FIFA announced on Thursday. 
FIFA said that 520,532 were sold in the first-come, first-served phase between July 5 and August 16, with Qatar, the United States, England, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, France, Argentina, Brazil and Germany the leading countries of residence for those purchasing match tickets. 
FIFA stated that the most popular games for ticket sales include Brazil’s group-phase encounters against Cameroon and Serbia, Portugal’s meeting with Uruguay, Costa Rica’s clash with Germany, and Australia against Denmark. 
“Fans living in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United States, Mexico, the United Arab Emirates, England, Argentina, Brazil, Wales and Australia led the way and the digital queues by securing the biggest number of tickets,” FIFA said. 
The cheapest tickets for fans from outside Qatar are priced at 250 riyals ($69). Fans need a confirmed ticket purchase to book places to stay in Qatar through an official tournament website. 
FIFA previously said it got 3 million ticket requests for the World Cup final on Dec 18 — Qatar’s national day — at the new 80,000-seat Lusail Stadium. 
In June organisers said there had been “record-breaking” demand for tickets at a time when 1.2 million had been sold. 
That figure has now more than doubled, with total ticket sales including those going to partners of FIFA, federations and for hospitality, as well as to the general public. 
There are 3,010,679 tickets available altogether, with FIFA saying a “last-minute” sales period will open in the run-up to the start of the tournament at a date still to be confirmed. Over-the-counter sales will also start in Doha after the launch of the last-minute sales phase. 
More seats typically become available as stakeholders return some of their allocation, and during the World Cup from fans of teams that are eliminated. 
More than a million visitors are expected in Qatar — the tiny Gulf state with 2.8 million inhabitants — for the 64-game tournament in eight stadiums in and around Doha. 
The World Cup begins a day earlier than originally scheduled with the opening ceremony taking place before the host nation kick off the tournament on Sunday, Nov 20 against Ecuador. 
It will be the first World Cup staged in the Middle East and has been pushed back to later in the year than its typical June-July schedule to avoid the region’s punishing summer heat.

The programme, which is being started as the Pakistan Football Connect programme, will allow the Haroon Malik-led NC to register clubs from across the country before carrying out the all-important process of scrutiny, which global football body FIFA identified as the first step towards holding elections when it appointed the NC back in September 2019. 
It also marks the first step the NC has taken towards the election process since FIFA lifted a 15-month suspension on the PFF at the end of June after the NC regained control of the PFF headquarters. 
“I want to congratulate the football community on the launch of the Pakistan Football Connect programme,” Haroon told a news conference on Thursday. 
“We now have a way to ensure that no stakeholder in Pakistan football is left unregistered or uncounted. This is the foundation of a robust system that Pakistan football was searching for and after many decades.” 
Haroon also announced that the Pakistan Football Connect programme will be headquartered in Karachi with dedicated staff working to facilitate the registrations of various football stakeholders across the country. There will also be an Urdu version to allow easier access and registration. 
Not only would the Connect programme allow the clubs to be registered but officials, players, coaches and referees will also be registered.

8,Coric crashes Nadal’s Cincinnati welcome back party,CINCINNATI: Borna Coric spoiled the return of Rafael Nadal after a five-year absence from the ATP and WTA Cincinnati...,"CINCINNATI: Borna Coric spoiled the return of Rafael Nadal after a five-year absence from the ATP and WTA Cincinnati Masters on Wednesday with a 7-6 (11-9), 4-6, 6-3 upset victory in the second round.
The 36-year-old Spaniard, who won the Cincinnati title in 2013, was playing his first match in well over a month after withdrawing with an abdominal injury from his Wimbledon semi-final against Nick Kyrgios.
“When you come back from injury, if you win the first match things get better,” Nadal said.  “That was not the case today.”
Nadal began the season with three titles and 20 consecutive wins but will head into the US Open after only one summer hardcourt match.
“This tournament was difficult for me. He played better,” Nadal said.  “It’s difficult to take a lot of positive things from this match.
“I need to practice. I need to return better. That’s the truth.”
The night appearance by the 22-time Grand Slam champion was interrupted for an hour and a quarter by rain in the opening set.
Once back, the pair struggled into a first-set tie-breaker which lasted for well over a quarter of an hour.
Nadal missed on two set points of his own and had to save two set points for Coric.
But on the Croat’s third opportunity, Nadal handed over the set after an hour and a quarter on court with a costly double-fault.
“I had chances in the tiebreaker and I played terrible on two easy set points,” Nadal said.
Nadal then took another 75 minutes to square the match thanks to a break in the seventh game of the second set.
The Spaniard was broken to trail 2-4 on a forehand wide, opening the door for Coric, who finished off the victory in just under three hours.
“It was very very special,” said Coric, who had shoulder surgery last year.
“I’ve been out the last two years injured. I didn’t play on the big stage.
“I was looking forward to playing this match. It was all kind of crazy I would say.” 
Kyrgios, meanwhile, lost his way amid objections to on-court advertising lights, with the Wimbledon runner-up falling 6-3, 6-2 to American Taylor Fritz.
The Australian was in complaint mode from the start, lamenting the distraction of flickering LED lights on an advertising board and demanding a fix.
World number 28 Kyrgios, after a standout summer which included the Washington title this month, could not find his best game in crashing out to 11th seed Fritz after only 50 minutes.
Women’s 10th seed Emma Raducanu dispatched her second Grand Slam champion in less than 24 hours, crushing Victoria Azarenka 6-0, 6-2.
The teenaged US Open champion claimed the first 10 games before Azarenka, a two-time Australian Open champion, finally captured a game.
But the young Briton, who ousted Serena Williams the night before with another love set, denied Azarenka on two break points in the final game to win in 63 minutes.
“It was another really difficult match and a tough matchup to play Vika,” Raducanu said.  “I knew I had to be really on my game. I didn’t have much time to turn around.
“I’m obviously pleased with how I played today and how I stayed really focused.” Andy Murray needed a post-match on-court visit from the trainer after losing 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to Cameron Norrie in the second round.
Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, twice a Cincinnati champion, needed massage on his right thigh before leaving the court after battling for nearly two and three-quarter hours.
“My consistency maybe was not where I’d want it,” Murray said.  “But there was some positive tennis in there at times. I definitely had enough opportunities to win.” After cramping at other events in recent weeks, the 35-year-old Scotsman is worried about his physical situation.
American Ben Shelton stunned fifth seed Casper Ruud, defeating the Norwegian 6-3, 6-3, while women’s world number one Iga Swiatek beat Sloane Stephens 6-4, 7-5.

Incumbent men’s world champion Ahsan, who is also the national U-17 champion, and national U-18 runner-up Hamza were supposed to participate in the event but failed to receive their passports before the departure date.
“There is no response from the Romanian embassy in Islamabad where the cueists along with three officials have submitted their passports in person on Aug 8,” sources told Dawn on Thursday.
The three officials who have submitted their passports to secure visa incl­u­de Pakistan Billiards and Snooker Federation chairman Alamgir Shaikh, senior vice-president Abdul Qadir Memon and referee Naveed Kapadia.
Romania is hosting the World U-16, U-18 (men) and U-21 (men and women) Snooker Championships which will run from Aug. 14-27.

10,Ireland edge Afghanistan for  T20 series win,BELFAST: George Dockrell saw Ireland to a narrow T20 International series win over Afghanistan in a rain-affected...,"BELFAST: George Dockrell saw Ireland to a narrow T20 International series win over Afghanistan in a rain-affected finale at Stormont on Wednesday.
Dockrell hit the winning run with two balls to spare after Ireland had been set a revised target of 56 in seven overs, with a seven-wicket victory giving the hosts the five-match contest 3-2.
Ireland paceman Mark Adair removed openers Hazratullah Zazai and Rahmanullah Gurbaz in his first over after home skipper Andy Balbirnie won the toss.
And when Adair dismissed Ibrahim Zadran, he had figures of 3-16, with Afghanistan 26-3 inside four overs.
Usman Ghani, however, led an Afghanistan counter-attack after Josh Little had Najibullah Zadran and captain Mohammad Nabi caught behind by Lorcan Tucker off successive deliveries.
But having made an unbeaten 44, off just 40 balls — including three fours and two sixes — Ghani’s innings was curtailed by rain, with Afghanistan 95-5 off 15 overs.
A lengthy delay left Ireland chasing a revised target.
Off-spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman had Balbirnie lbw for nine and when he had Paul Stirling (16) caught at midwicket, Ireland were 38-2.
That became 45-3 when Tucker fell to leg-spinner Rashid Khan for 14.
But Harry Tector and Dockrell then held their nerve as Ireland won with three wickets down.

12,Benfica take control of Dynamo tie in CL,PARIS: Dynamo Kyiv’s unlikely bid to qualify for the Champions League ran up against a tough Benfica team that won...,"PARIS: Dynamo Kyiv’s unlikely bid to qualify for the Champions League ran up against a tough Benfica team that won 2-0 in Poland in the first leg of their playoff tie on Wednesday. 
Dynamo’s fifth game in Champions League qualifying in the past month was played in the Polish city of Lodz, where Dynamo are in exile following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that started in February. 
Gilberto and Goncalo Ramos scored first-half goals as twice former European champions Benfica took a big stride towards qualifying for the lucrative group stage. 
Red Star Belgrade, the 1991 European Cup winners, lost 3-2 away to Israeli champions Maccabi Haifa, who are hoping to reach the group stage for the third time after 2002-03 and 2009-10. 
Haitian forward Frantzdy Pierrot struck twice for Maccabi as the hosts opened the scoring but then fell behind as Red Star replied with goals from Aleksandar Pesic and Guelor Kanga. 
Pierrot equalised shortly after half-time and Tjaronn Chery grabbed the winner on the hour to give Maccabi a narrow advantage heading into next week’s return leg in Serbia. 
In the other playoff first-leg game on Wednesday, Qarabag drew 0-0 with Czech champions Viktoria Plzen in Baku. 
The second legs are scheduled for August 23. 
Benfica started strongly and waited just nine minutes for a reward when Brazilian defender Gilberto overlapped in attack to score with a rising shot into the top corner. 
Dynamo responded thanks to Viktor Tsygankov, whose effort forced Odiseas Vlachodimos into a smart save. 
Roger Schmidt’s side had dominance in possession, while the Ukrainian side tried fast counterattacks. In the 24th minute, Joao Mario might have doubled the lead, but he missed the target.
Goncalo Ramos turned out to be more effective. Eight minutes before the break, the Portugal Under-21 forward, a transfer target for several teams, clipped the ball home after a surprising turn from David Neres. 
In the second half, Benfica controlled the game to be more focused on defence. Ramos, who scored a hat trick in the third qualifying round against Midtjylland, was replaced by former Dynamo forward Roman Yaremchuk. 
About 30,000 fans at Sammy Ofer Stadium in the northern city of Haifa saw Israeli champions Maccabi dominate in the opening minutes and score in the 18th minute through Pierrot, after a cross by Dolev Haziza. 
Red Star recovered quickly, and evened the score in the 27th minute, after a shot by midfielder Aleksandar Katai hit his team-mate Pesic and confused goalkeeper Josh Cohen on the way to the net. 
The visitors completed a turnover in the 40th minute from an accurate shot by Gabonese midfielder Guelor Kanga, after a pass by Ghanaian winger Osman Bukari. 
But Maccabi equalised in the 51st minute, with a shot by Pierrot who completed a brace, again after a pass by Haziza. 
Haziza also set up the winner in the 61st minute, with a pass to Surinamese midfielder Chery, who scored impressively from 18 metres ahead of the second leg in Belgrade.

13,Brooks powers West Indies to victory over NZ,BRIDGETOWN: Shamarh Brooks played the sheet anchor role to perfection in guiding the West Indies to a five-wicket...,"BRIDGETOWN: Shamarh Brooks played the sheet anchor role to perfection in guiding the West Indies to a five-wicket victory over top-ranked New Zealand in a low-scoring opening day-night One-day Intern­ational of a three-match series here at the Kensington Oval on Wednesday.
After the home side’s bowling combination pace and spin dismissed the visitors for 190 off 45.2 overs batting first, Brooks’ 91-ball 79 with nine fours and one six provided the much-needed solidity to take his team to 193 for five off 39 overs in reply.
His 72-run fourth-wicket partnership with captain Nicholas Pooran (28) steadied the chase and ensured there would be no repeat of the collapses which have become an all-too-common feature of their game in recent years.
“It was important just to get a start because this was not the easiest pitch to bat on,” said Brooks after receiving the man-of-the-match award.
“It was especially gratifying to be in a good partnership with the captain and to see the way he really buckled down, which is not his nature.”
Not only did the result mark New Zealand’s first ODI loss of the year but it also ended the Caribbean team’s abysmal run of nine consecutive losses in the 50 overs-per-side format.
More importantly, it earned them 10 vital points in the bid to qualify for next year’s World Cup in India.
Left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein and fast bowler Alzarri Joseph claimed three wickets each as the Black Caps, winners of the preceding T20 Intern­ational series in Jamaica 2-1, laboured in the conditions earlier in the day with captain Kane Williamson top-scoring with 34.
Put in on a bright afternoon, New Zealand looked to be establishing the platform for a formidable total via an opening stand of 41 between Finn Allen (25) and Martin Guptill (24).
Hosein changed the complexion of the innings with the first three wickets but it was Joseph’s double-strike in the 30th over which proved the most incisive as he first trapped Daryl Mitchell leg-before and then induced an outside edge from Williamson’s bat to wicketkeeper Shai Hope.
A 40-run seventh-wicket stand between Michael Bracewell (31) and Mitchell Santner (25) gave New Zealand hope of pushing past 200 but Jason Holder claimed two wickets in two balls and Joseph wrapped up the innings in the 46th over when Trent Boult played on.
