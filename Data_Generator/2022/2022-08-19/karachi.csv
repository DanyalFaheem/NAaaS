They have also called upon the federal government to declare Sindh as calamity-hit. 
AT central organiser Lal Jarwar has criticised the Sindh government for not utilising budget of municipal bodies in rain emergency.  
He said the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) and opposition parties had disappeared in the present conditions. He urged the federal government to declare Sindh as calamity-hit. 
In a statement issued here on Thursday, he said the district-level committees of the Sindh government had failed to perform even in emergencies. They were indulged in corruption instead of carrying out relief work, he observed.  
He said that in rural areas, livestock had perished and the houses of poor villagers were badly damaged.  
He said the rains had damaged standing crops in fields, causing huge losses to growers. The federal and Sindh governments should pay Rs10 million compensation for each life lost in the rain-related incidents and Rs5 million for damaged houses in katchi abadis. 
In a statement on Thursday, Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders and Small Industry president Mohammad Altaf Memon requested the CM to allocate some portion of US government’s $1m flood assistance given to Sindh for the restoration of Hyderabad and Karachi’s infrastructure. 
He said the two cities should be declared calamity-hit and emergency should be declared there. Compensation should be paid to the traders who had suffered losses due to rain, he added. 
He said that electricity and gas bills’ recovery should be waived for at least one year to help traders and businessmen financially.  
He said the recent rains had affected many cities, inundating low-lying areas there. 
He said the drainage of rainwater had become a serious problem for the authorities, causing damages to traders’ properties. Due to short circuit in shops, some traders had suffered heavy losses.

1,Six friends denied bail in Karachi's DHA high-rise death case,Judge observes the applicants claim themselves to be close friends of victim but they left him unattended.,"KARACHI: A sessions court on Thursday dismissed bail applications of six young men held in connection with the death of a young man, who fell from a multi-storey residential building in Defence Housing Authority (DHA) Phase VIII last month.
Police booked and arrested Syed Muhammad Ammar, Usman Ahmed, Muhammad Awais, Aziz Ahmed, Ahmed Jamil and Syed Khizr Akbar following the death of their 26-year-old friend, Adil Masood Khan, on July 31.
On Thursday, Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Shahid Ali Memon pronounced his order reserved earlier on the suspects’ bail applications seeking grant of post-arrest bail.
While dismissing their bail pleas, the judge noted that the applicants claimed themselves to be close friends of the victim but they left him unattended. “Therefore, under such circumstances, it can be said that the accused persons ruined the trust of [their] friend,” the order said.
The judge observed that even if it was presumed that the suspects being friends of the deceased had no mala fide intention on their part, then the question arose as to why they had left the body unattended.
The court ruled that the case was at the stage of investigation and if bail was considered under such circumstances, it would amount to encouraging such a bad behaviour of the applicants.
Earlier, defence counsel submitted that their clients were innocent and implicated in the case as the victim was their friend.
On the other hand, the state prosecutor argued that the suspects did not deserve to be released on bail as they had abandoned their friend after the incident and fled with mala fide intentions.
He said the police incorporated Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) in the case, due to which they were not entitled to the concession of bail.
According to the prosecution, the victim had got an apartment on one-day rent in a DHA high-rise building, where he and his friends were having a party. Adil fell from the balcony of the flat, hit the ground and died. His friends fled the scene and the building administration shifted the body to a hospital later.
A case was registered under Section 322 (manslaughter) and 34 (common intention) of the PPC at the Darakhshan police station on the complaint of victim’s sister Varda Masood.

Inundation ravages Gadap town, many other localities; six more people die in rain-related incidents

The drowned persons were identified as the couple Mohammed Zeeshan Ansari and Rabia and their four children namely Hamna, Ebad, Mohammed Moosa and Ayan and their driver, Abdul Rehman. 
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said the body of Mohammed Moosa, 10, had been fished out in the afternoon. In the evening, the body of Hamna, seven, was found. 
Edhi Foundation head Faisal Edhi and his son Saad Edhi were personally supervising the rescue operation since Wednesday night, added the spokesperson. 
Memon Goth SHO Ateeq Rehman said they received information on Madadgar-15 that one family travelling in a car had fallen in the Nadi (river) at link road at Dumloti-8 and rescue efforts were launched. He said when the water level receded to some extent on Thursday, the car surfaced at Bakhshani Goth in the river, but the vehicle was without any person. 
The SHO said the family had come from Hyderabad to attend a marriage ceremony in Karachi. They were returning to their home in Hyderabad on Wednesday evening when they were reportedly drowned. 
A resident of Dumloti-6, Engineer Amjad Jan Brohi, told Dawn that the bridge of Malir River on the link road (which connects National Highway with Superhighway (now Motorway-9) through Gulshan-i-Hadeed had been in a dilapidated condition for long and was not being used by commuters. 
The authorities have built a causeway, which is being used by motorists. 
However, because of heavy rains which continued on the outskirts of Malir for several hours on Wednesday, the causeway was overflowing when the heavy flow of water swept away the car along with its occupants. 
The residents said that rescue teams were facing difficulties in tracing the drowned persons because there were deep ditches caused by of gravel and sand lifting from the bed of Malir River by the ‘reeti bajri mafia’ besides there were bushes all over the area. They feared that the family members might have been stuck up in the bushes or the deep ditches in the river. 
Saad Edhi told Dawn that they were facing difficulties in tracing the drowned persons because it was a vast area besides heavy flow of water.
Relatives complain of slow pace of rescue operation 
Relatives of the drowning victims while speaking to the media complained of slow pace of the rescue operation. 
Mohammed Danish, a maternal nephew of drowned Mohammed Zeeshan Ansari, said that his uncle along with his wife and four children was returning home in Hyderabad after the marriage ceremony in a rented car. 
He said because of the rain, they travelled on the link road where the car was swept away by heavy flow of water. 
He said his uncle had hired a cab and advised the driver not to use the link road as it was dangerous. 
Ubaidullah, brother of the drowned driver, Abdul Rehman, said his brother was returning home in Hyderabad when the family hired his cab. The driver had made a phone contact with his wife on Wednesday at 6pm saying that he might reach Hyderabad within two-and-a-half hours. 
“Rescue operation is very slow,” complained Ubaidullah.
He suggested that Pakistan Navy rescue teams be called in. He believed that the water in the river receded and. as such, the rescue efforts should be expedited. He said only Edhi volunteers were helping in the rescue operation. 
Saad Edhi told the media that because of heavy flow of water; the cab was taken far away, which was recovered a distance of around three kilometres from the reported place of drowning incident. 
Similarly, the boy’s body was found at a distance of four kilometres from the site. He said with the help of boats, Edhi divers had launched a rescue operation spread over a radius of three-four kilometres.

He said three seasonal rivers namely Bazaar Nadi, Kathor Nadi and Ansari Bridge Nadi were overflowing with rainwater and the water of all the three seasonal rivers had entered Malir River, compounding the problem. 
He recalled that four-five villages were evacuated in Gadap as rainwater was seen overflowing even upper underpass of Bahria Town Karachi. 
However, this tragic incident of drowning of car occurred in the link road. The SSP said the area people asked the family not to go there, but perhaps they did not realise the gravity of the situation. He said so far, bodies of two children had been recovered. Mr Bahadur added that Pakistan Navy had also joined the rescue efforts.

Speaking to Dawn, the experts described her operation on Thursday as less-challenging as compared to Madhubala’s which took the team five hours and 40 minutes to complete a day earlier.  
“I am very much relieved today. It took us over three hours this time but the infection was still severe,” Dr Aaamir Khalil leading the global animal welfare group’s team said. 
Both animals were recovering satisfactorily and would be reunited soon, he added. 
Sharing his experience, team member Dr Thomas Bernd Hildebrandt, who heads the Department of Reproduction Management at Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, said Noor Jehan’s tusk root was infested with worms and maggots.  
“The worms were 23 centimetres inside her head. We removed a tumor and a lot of dead tissues,” he said, adding that the infection could have affected her eyes and the brain, if left untreated. 
Dr Thomas, a full professor of Wildlife Reproduction Medicine at Freie Universität Berlin, emphasised the need for post-surgery care for which the local zoo staff needed training.   
Both experts agreed that these animals once rehabilitated should be united with Malika and Sonia, the two Safari Park elephants, as they all belonged to the same herd. The four female elephants were caught from the wild in Tanzania and brought to Karachi in 2009.  
“Elephants are known for their intelligence, close family ties and social complexity. It’s important for their wellbeing that the four are kept together and the husbandry issue is addressed as the four animals are in their prime breeding age.” 
In this respect, Dr Hildebrandt pointed out, artificial insemination could be an option (as there was no male member in the group) for which the animal welfare group could provide technical support to the local staff. 
“But, this could only work when animals are provided with nice living conditions,” he said.

4,Petition of accused for quashment of FIR in underage marriage case disposed of,"Notices issued to prosecutor general, IO on contempt plea.","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday disposed of a petition filed by Zaheer Ahmed, who allegedly abducted an underage girl from Karachi and contracted marriage with her in Lahore, seeking quashment of the case and also a petition filed by the girl’s father seeking supervision of investigation for not being maintainable. However, the court issued notices to the Sindh prosecutor general and investigating officer of the case on another application filed by Zaheer Ahmed seeking contempt proceedings against the PG and IO for fixing criminal liability regarding alleged abduction despite court orders.
Ahmed in his petition contended that he had contracted the marriage with Dua’s own freewill and she had given several statements before the high court and lower courts as well as police about her freewill marriage, but her father nominated him in a supplementary statement due to same grudge, and pleaded to quash the FIR.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha observed that the petition was not maintainable since the matter had been charge sheeted and the petitioner had alternative remedy before the trial court.

Notices issued to prosecutor general, IO on contempt plea

Syed Mehdi Ali Kazmi, father of the underage girl, through his lawyer had also approached the SHC and argued that he was dissatisfied with the conduct of the IO who, according to him attempted to conclude his investigation in favour of the accused by removing key offences without collecting any new evidence.
The petitioner contended that his underage daughter was abducted from his house in Karachi on April 16 and forced to contract a marriage. He submitted in court that he had lodged an FIR at the Al-Falah police station about kidnapping of his daughter.
He pleaded that the investigation of the case be supervised by a DIG and the IO be restrained from submitting the charge sheet.
The bench also deposed of this petition for not being maintainable in the constitutional jurisdiction of SHC and observed that the charge sheet had already been filed before the court concerned and the petitioner had alternative remedy before the trial court.  
The same bench also put the PG and IO, alleged contemnors, on notice with direction to appear before it on the next hearing, to be fixed after six weeks.
The counsel for Ahmed argued that alleged contemnors were implicating the petitioner and his family members in the case which was blatant disobedience of high court orders and tantamount to contempt.

6,"Around 56,000 students in Pakistan get their O Level results","KARACHI: Thousands of students who had appeared for their Cambridge O Level, Cambridge International General...","KARACHI: Thousands of students who had appeared for their Cambridge O Level, Cambridge International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) and Cambridge International Certificate in Education (ICE) exams in June 2022 received their results on Thursday along with a quarter of a million of their peers from around the world.
It was a test of nerves for the students in Sindh as fearing bad weather and torrential rains the provincial government had ordered closure of all education institutions for a day. Many students who were looking forward to going to school and receiving their results in person from there and celebrating with their friends were unable to do that. Some schools notified them about their results through email, some through WhatsApp and some through phone calls. But until that happened, they all kept checking their email accounts and smart phones. Many also kept checking with their friends if they had received their results yet.
Still, all schools did not follow that pattern. Some schools did keep their office open for their Cambridge students to be able to come and take their results from them in person.
Then after getting the results, there were others things to worry about as some students were not happy and satisfied with their results unlike others who were quite happy. Also, it was felt by many students that this year the threshold was too high because many hardworking students expecting higher grades did not get what they had hoped for.
It has been another difficult year for students and teachers worldwide, with some still affected by lockdowns and most still dealing with the various effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.
In Pakistan, over 200,000 Cambridge O Level and Cambridge IGCSE subject entries were made by schools in the June 2022 exam series, with around 56,000 students appearing for exams from 628 schools. Students sat their exams amid strict Covid-19 standard operating procedures, which were implemented to keep them safe, whilst enabling them to gain their qualifications and continue with their next educational steps. Cambridge International (CI) also provided support to help students and teachers to adapt running of exams and other assessments to the disruption caused by Covid-19.
Islamiyat, English Language and Pakistan Studies were the most popular Cambridge O Level subjects in the June 2022 exam series among Pakistani students.
CI’s chief accountable officer Christine Özden said that this year had been another tough one. “The pandemic has continued to disrupt our lives and learning in different ways. Some of our students and teachers have been affected by school closures and ongoing restrictions,” he said and added: “More than ever, I congratulate Cambridge students for their hard work towards these results. They’ve shown great resilience and dedication to get to this point, and I am proud of everyone’s achievements. They can now progress to new opportunities and experiences, and I’m confident they have the skills, knowledge and courage to succeed in every choice they make.”
“I also want to express special thanks to Cambridge schools and teachers. Their commitment and passion for education has been fundamental to their students’ success,” he further said.
CI Pakistan country director Uzma Yousuf said that she would like to congratulate all of their students in Pakistan on their Cambridge O Level and Cambridge IGCSE results. 
She said: “This is a fantastic achievement, in the face of yet another difficult year, as these students have had to overcome many challenges brought by the Covid-19 pandemic,” and added: “All those receiving results today should be very proud of what they have achieved. I would also like to congratulate the teachers, schools and families for the constant support they have given to our students through such uncertain times, which has enabled them to gain their qualifications and continue with their studies.”
“I would like to appreciate the diligence of our partners, the British Council, for conducting these exams during this time and for ensuring the safety of all the students taking their exams, by adhering to strict Covid-19 safety measures,” she continued.
Across the entire CI exam series in June 2022, more than 460,000 students, making 1.4 million entries in 147 countries, were able to gain the qualifications they need to progress.
More than 700 schools across Pakistan offer Cambridge programmes and qualifications to their students. The Cambridge Pathway curriculum offers flexibility and choice to students and schools, with over 40 subjects available in Cambridge O Level, over 70 subjects at Cambridge IGCSE and over 55 subjects offered at CI AS and A Level, and a choice of two exam series each year. CI AS and A Level results have already been announced on Aug 11.

According to a statement issued by HWA on Thursday, thousands of peasants and labourers’ houses collapsed, their crops destroyed, cattle died due to lack of fodder and diseases and daily wagers were in a state of hunger due to non-availability of work in the rainy weather. Children, women, and men were also said to be suffering from various diseases due to mosquitoes and stagnant water. The demanded that government should provide an immediate relief package to peasants and labourers.
HWA President Akram Khaskheli said that the rain has caused havoc in the province since last month, due to which, cotton crops being cultivated on millions of acres had been destroyed, the cattle were dying in Sindh, specifically in Sanghar, Badin, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot, Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Naushahro Feroze, Sukkur, Ghotki, Khairpur, Dadu and other districts. 
“This amounts to millions of rupees of loss to the peasants and they are facing debt. The situation can lead them to further destruction and become a reason for forced labour and already, the situation of forced labour is the worst in Sindh,” he said.
He added that from 2013 to 2021, a total of 10,190 peasants and labourers had been released from the captivity of landlords and brick kiln owners through court orders. Seven years ago, the Sindh Bonded Labour System Abolition Act (SBLSAA) 2016 was passed, but its implementation is zero. The District Vigilance Committees were also not constituted in all districts to monitor the situation of bonded labour. 
“Due to the non-availability of economic opportunities in the field of agriculture and livestock and non-implementation of SBLSAA, there are chances that rain-affected peasants and labourers could become victims of bonded labour, therefore, we demand that the government take concrete measures to ensure livelihood support to peasants and daily wagers. SBLSAA must be implemented in true letter and spirit,” he said and added: “Currently, it is cotton-picking season in Sindh, which provides an opportunity for livelihood to thousands of women and men, but due to the destruction of the crop, they could not find employment. They have migrated from Mithi, Umerkot, and Mirpurkhas to Sanghar, Nawabshah, Naushahro Feroze, Khairpur, Matiari and Hyderabad. Being residents of other districts, they are helpless at this time and are sitting under the sky. Every district administration should help them immediately on the basis of migrant workers.” 
He also said that men, women, old people and children sleep under the open sky as their houses, traditionally made with mud, had demolished. They also lack basic facilities such as safe drinking water and toilets. Their cattle and livestock suffer from mosquitoes, waterborne disease and insects.
He further said that millions of farmers and labourers in Sindh have been pushed into poverty by the rains, but the government has not announced any assistance for them so far. 
“The Sindh government should declare the entire province as flood/disaster affected and provide financial assistance to them under livestock and housing, immediately. They should be provided with tents, mosquito nets, mosquito spray, food and drink, equipment for digging drains and ensuring drainage of water from villages and crops,” he concluded.

Unabated rain brought civic life to a halt in Hyderabad which remained entirely shut in the wake of government’s announcement of holiday. Luckily, no casualty was reported from any part of the district though there were reports of collapse of houses’ walls in Pucca Qilla.
According to Hyderabad deputy commissioner, 204.75mm of rainfall has been recorded in last 60 hours since Aug 16 till Thursday 12 noon.
Met office said that 17mm of rain was recorded at airport office and 24mm at city office from 8am to 8pm on Aug 18.
On Thursday, downpour continued intermittently, leading to accumulation of rainwater on main arteries and low-lying areas. Hyderabad railway station was the worst affected area as it remained inaccessible to pedestrians as well as motorists. Some donkey carts were seen ferrying train passengers to and from the railway station.
Streets in Latifabad unit-2 and 11, Qadam Gah Maula Ali road, City Cloth market road, Fakir ka Pir, Pinjra Pole area, Hali road, American Quarters, Qazi Qayoom road, Gharib Nawaz Colony and areas in Qasimabad including Anwar Villas, Faraz Villas, Qasim Nagar, Sheedi Goth area, Citizen Colony, Gulistan-i-Sajjad, London Town, Prince Town, Bhitai Town and Sehrish Nagar were submerged in rainwater.

The unabated rain in Khirthar ranges cut off land link of 300 more villages in Kachho from Johi town and caused 50 mud-thatched houses to collapse.
10 villages flooded 
The Main Nara Valley Drain developed breaches at Pir Mashaikh and other parts, inundating 10 villages while heavy rain continued to batter Jamshoro, Kotri, Nooriabad, Sann, Manjhand, Sehwan and Bhan Syedabad towns.
Indus Highway came under water at Sann, Laky Shah Saddar and Jamshoro towns after hill torrents flowed over the highway during the heavy rain. 
Rainwater entered houses in Bhan Syedabad town and caused several mud-thatched houses to cave in. The town residents complained that no government official had arrived to help them.
Heavy rain paralysed life in Shaheed Benazirabad division, Sanghar, Tando Adam, Shahdadpur, Sinjhoro and Khipro areas as the rainwater disrupted entire drainage system and entered houses and shops. Dozens of mud-thatched houses collapsed in Sanghar during rain. 
The drainage of the stagnant rainwater was increasingly becoming difficult with rise in canals’ level.
Sangahr Deputy Commissioner Imran Al Hasan Khawaja said that nine people had died in the district and PDMA had given the heirs a total of rupees one million. The remaining heirs would also receive compensation, he said.
It rained heavily in Nawabshah and Naushahro Feroze districts and their towns of Bandhi, Daulatpur, Kazi Ahmed, Sakrand, Moro, Kandiaro and Mehrabpur where all roads were inundated and rainwater entered houses in low-lying localities.
In Mirpurkhas, two days of continuous heavy rainfall caused flooding in the district as the city, all the towns and villages had come under one to two feet rainwater.
The district administration had announced opening relief centres for the rain-hit people who had taken shelter in nearby government buildings, makeshift huts and other safe places but it had not yet done anything to 
that effect. Hundreds of families had shifted to safe places after rainwater entered their houses. 
Civil society and religious and social organisations condemned Mirpurkhas municipal committee for inefficiency and said that despite having huge budget and resources at its disposal it had failed to drain out rainwater from the city.

several villages were flooded forcing a large population to shift to safe places along main roads, highways and in nearby government buildings. 
The affected villagers demanded the chief minister immediately start relief work and set up relief camps to save the rain-hit people from hunger and diseases.
Farmers Khalid Arain, Mohammad Ali Bhurgari, Maqsood Rajput and others said that the heavy rainfall had created flood-like conditions in all seven talukas of the district. 
They blamed influential landlords for having established illegal dykes in the riverbed to save their farmland and villages by diverting water flow towards villages of poor people. 
They demanded Hesco reduce loadshedding hours and provide power to the city and towns so that pumping machines could drain out stagnant rainwater from low-lying areas, roads and streets. 
They urged high authorities to provide food and shelter to the rain-hit people and declare Mirpurkhas district as calamity-hit area.
In Badin, continuous rain for the last two weeks caused widespread damage to rice fields and washed away paddy saplings after surface drains failed to drain out water from the fields. Crops of cotton, tomatoes and vegetables were also destroyed in the rain.

Scores of mud-thatched houses collapsed in the town and roof of a house caved in on inmates in Noor Khan Dhonkai village, wounding Ranjho Dhonkai, who was taken to Hyderabad in critical condition.
No relief activities have been initiated by the government and encroachments have not been removed from rain drains, which create obstructions to dewatering operation carried by growers on their own.
