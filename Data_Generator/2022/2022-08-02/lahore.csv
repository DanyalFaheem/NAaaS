0,Zoo safari selling 12 African lions,Sources say animals being auctioned over ‘feed cost issue’,"LAHORE: Owing to lack of space and breeding issues, the Lahore Zoo Safari is set to sell its 12 African lions through auction, sources told Dawn. 
Sources said the Lahore Zoo Safari currently houses 29 African lions, three white lions, six tigers and two jaguars. The presence of jaguars at the safari makes the captive breeding facility exceptional as jaguars are not available all over Punjab in captive breeding except the safari. 
The sources said that in the wake of the increased figure of African lions at the safari, the zoo management committee took a decision a few months ago to auction 12 African lions, including nine females and three males. The committee was of the view that by putting the lions on auction would increase space and help in smooth breeding of lions.  
Nevertheless, like other public captive breeding facilities and wildlife parks, pairing is again a big issue with which these places are confronted.  

Sources say animals being auctioned over ‘feed cost issue’

To many wildlife lovers, the Punjab Wildlife Department is not paying due attention towards pairing of animals be it Lahore Zoo, Lahore Zoo Safari or other Zoos and Wildlife Parks.  
The sources said that another factor behind the auction is the feed expenses incurred on the feeding of animals; however, Lahore Zoo Safari in-charge Tanveer Janjua vehemently denied the reports in the media that lions were being auctioned due to feed expenses.  
“This is absolutely wrong that the auction is taking place due to the feed expenses as it’s all about the lack of space at the safari and suitable breeding atmosphere for animals,” said Mr Janjua who added that the auction was taking place on the decision of the zoo management committee.  
He said the lions to be auctioned on Aug 11 had been chipped. Only those could apply for the auction who had registered animal breeding farms and every applicant would come up with a pay order of Rs37,500, he added.  
The auction of African lions requires active FBR registration, copy of valid breeding farm/dealer license, no objection certificate from assistant director wildlife concerned, certificate from veterinarian and other such requirements. 
According to some media reports, the zoo safari is selling some lions at a price as low as Rs150,000.

On Tuesday last, two armed men ‘kidnapped’ the lawyer when she was sitting in the driving seat of her car parked in a DHA street. The criminals drove away the car in broad daylight after dropping the lawyer at some distance. They also took away a laptop, cash and other valuables that were in the car.
On being informed of the incident, police registered a case against unidentified criminals and started investigation.
The complainant told Dawn she was abducted and tortured in the car by the criminals, but the police did not include abduction charges in the first information report (FIR).
Narrating the incident, the lawyer said she was sitting in her vehicle when two men arrived there in a car. She said one of the criminals occupied the back seat of her car, while the other first thrashed her and then took the driving seat.
She said the intruders subjected her to torture and tried to get her phone, which she had already placed under the car’s carpet. Meanwhile, she said, an another car kept following her vehicle closely.  
The lawyer said though she suffered injuries to her neck, face, back and legs because of the torture by the criminals, the police did not get her examined medically.  
About the police claim of arresting one of the suspects, the lawyer said she was not called for identification of the suspect so far.
She said several other victims of such crimes from Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Sheikhupura and Lahore had contacted her after the incident was reported in the media and complained about lack of police help in arresting the criminals and recovering their vehicles.
She said the criminals had also abducted some of the victims and released them after receiving ransom from their families.
On Saturday, police had claimed to have arrested one of the suspects identified as Abdullah from Bedian Road. Police claimed he was a member of a Rawalpindi-based gang involved in several cases of car theft.

A two-member bench, headed by Justice Muzzamil Akhtar Shabbir, heard a petition filed by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) against the election.
Advocate Mansoor Awan represented Malik Saiful Malook Khokhar, the PML-N candidate for PA speaker. He claimed that the election was held in an ‘illegal and unconstitutional manner’.
He contended that the contest for the speaker’s slot was a ‘sheer violation’ of Article 226 which said that “all elections under the Constitution, other than those of the Prime Minister and the Chief Minister, shall be by secret ballot”.
Mr Awan further said that a serial number was mentioned on the ballot papers and each MPA had to sign it. “The choice exercised by each MPA could be identified by comparing the serial number on the ballot paper and the signatures,” he added.
The court questioned whether there was any forum available to address the speaker election and could the matter be referred to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
However, Mr Awan responded in negative and said that the contest was challenged for the first time in the history of Pakistan.
The PML-N lawyer said that the election commission could take measures to stop rigging in such elections while the court had the power to intervene in this matter.
Later, the Lahore High Court issued notices to the respondents and summoned Punjab Advocate General (AG) for assistance in the case.
PTI candidate Sibtan Khan was elected as the new speaker of the Punjab Assembly on July 29. He secured 185 votes while PML-N’s Saiful Malook Khokhar obtained 175 votes.  
Meanwhile, special assistant to Prime Minister Ata Tarar, talking to media outside the court, said the speaker election was conducted under secret ballot but the government had violated Article 226 of the constitution.
He said the constitution was violated in the speaker’s election and Chauhdry Pervaiz Elahi had recruited seven people illegally.
He demanded that the election should be declared illegal and a new speaker election should be carried out according to the constitution.

8,52 Muzaffargah villages hit by flood in Chenab so far,Floodwater level expected to keep rising in next four days.,"MUZAFFARGARH: Fifty-two villages and crops of sugarcane and cotton on thousands of acres of land have so far been damaged by the flood in the Chenab river. 
On Tuesday (today), there will be high flood in the Muzaffargarh district. On the other side in Kot Addu, the water in the Indus river is rising, creating panic at the Head Taunsa Barrage. 
The irrigation department has closed the Muzaffargarh canal and TP Link canal since Saturday evening when the medium flood with 300,000 cusecs of water started passing from the Head Taunsa Barrage.  
Kot Addu Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Amir thinks that the floodwater will rise more in the coming four days and 20 more villages downstream had been evacuated by administration because of the dangerous situation and heavy erosion along the river Indus.  

Floodwater level expected to keep rising in next four days 

An irrigation official says three spur bunds on the river are in dangerous condition while the department is busy ensuring the protective measures.  
Deputy Commissioner Ali Annan Qamar visited the dangerous spots. He says the district administration is trying to control the alarming situation but three to four days will be required to control the breaches.  
The irrigation officials have issued the letters to the contractors to complete work on the breaches on the river Chenab. Schools have been closed in the flood-affected areas.  
An official says that from Rangpur to Muzaffargarh, 52 villages have been affected badly by the Chenab river and dozens of houses have been destroyed. The administration teams started assessing the losses after the Punjab government announced compensation for flood-affected people. 
The union council secretaries are making announcements in the villages to vacate the areas facing danger of flood on both sides of the Chenab; however, many families refused to evacuate their homes, saying that they would move to safer places if the situation worsened.  
The affected families claim that the district administration is not taking care of them and there is nothing to eat at the flood relief camps.  
The deputy commissioner says some areas have been declared unsafe because of erosion and the people living there have been asked to evacuate on an urgent basis. Crops of sugarcane and cotton on thousands acres have been damaged by the Chenab flood so far.

According to the spokesperson of Houbara Foundation, wildlife habitats are being degraded the world over because of over-grazing and wood-cutting by the local communities. Consequently, wild animals and birds are unable to find their favourite foods in sufficient quantities, resulting in their rapid decline and ecological imbalance.  
In 1998, the Houbara Foundation International Pakistan undertook to reinforce the diminishing vegetation through aerial broadcast of seeds of the desert plants in Cholistan, the prime wintering habitat of the houbara bustard. This year, 177kg seeds of houbara’s favorite food plants have been broadcast, bringing the total seed broadcast in the last 23 years to over 2,789kg. Regular monitoring of the habitat shows encouraging results and higher yields of germination are expected as the work goes on.  
Restoration of complete habitats is a long and laborious task but with dedicated support of the Pakistan Army, Houbara Foundation aims at continuing to work on the project and restore the ecological balance by reinforcing the desert vegetation and building up populations of the houbara and other wildlife species.

An official privy to the Punjab government told Dawn on Monday that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf  (PTI) leadership had marked 30 police officers for their “controversial” actions during the May 25 Azadi March.
Some of them were labelled as being close to the top leadership of the PML-N. 
According to the source, former Lahore DIG Sohail Chaudhry, Additional IG Usman Anwar and former capital city police officer Bilal Siddique Kamyana were at the top of the list.
On Monday, the government also removed Mr Anwar and repatriated him to Islamabad. He was posted during the tenure of the PML-N in Punjab on the recommendations of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Being an additional IG (AIG) of the special branch, he was said to be a highly influential police officer and directly reported the police matters to then chief minister Hamza Shehbaz.
Mr Chaudhry was first removed from his post of DIG Operations Lahore on July 31 and posted in the CTD on the recommendations by Inspector General of Police Faisal Shahkar.
Mr Shahkar defended Mr Chaudhry’s posting in the province and convinced the chief minister that any decision like sending him out of the province would be tantamount to ‘victimization’ and consequently, the Services & General Administration Department issued a notification of his appointment as the CTD DIG of Punjab on July 31. The following day, he was surrendered to Islamabad.

Now the law will take its course. Khan did not forget May 25. Will not forget”.

It is learnt that PTI leaders Shafqat Mehmood and Dr Shahbaz Gill also held a discussion with Moonis Elahi on the matter of cabinet formation as a follow-up meeting late on Sunday night after which the list of probables had to be sent to Mr Khan for his final approval. 
A close aide to the Punjab CM said that Mr Elahi had already done a lot of homework for launching different initiatives. He said Punjab police would be given at least 300 to 400 new vehicles for patrolling and police stations whereas the Punjab highways patrolling police might also get at least 150 more patrolling posts across the province. 
He said the incumbent IGP Faisal Shahkar had previously worked on the Punjab highway patrolling project during previous stint of Parvez Elahi as Punjab CM in 2002 to 2007 to improve the law and order. 
He said the city of Lahore could be bifurcated into four districts and at least three to four new districts would also be created and chances of Gujrat district getting divisional headquarter status were now bright as the provincial board of revenue had been tasked to work expeditiously on the matter. 
Similarly, he said the PTI-PML Q coalition had decided to establish a new international airport in Lahore as the existing airport might be utilised for domestic flights only.

19,Millers start submitting data to cane commissioner,LAHORE: Sugar mills in Punjab have begun submitting their sugarcane purchase data with the Punjab cane commissioner...,"LAHORE: Sugar mills in Punjab have begun submitting their sugarcane purchase data with the Punjab cane commissioner after the Lahore High Court (LHC) involved the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in obtaining the financial transactions of the millers from the banks in this regard and sharing it with the commissioner’s office.
The cane commissioner’s office has been making abortive attempts for the last many months to get a record of the cane purchase receipts to see if the growers are being paid their dues in accordance with the Punjab Sugar Factories (Control) Act 1950.
The Act binds the mills to pay the growers through banks within 15 days of the purchase of sugarcane. The mills are also bound to submit the data of sale/purchase with the cane commissioner’s office.
However, the millers have been reluctant to share the details.
Cane Commissioner Hussain Bahadur Ali Shah submitted before the court of Mr Justice Shahid Jamil Khan that most of the mills were not providing data on payments to cane growers and bank accounts to verify the transactions.
It was also submitted that because of the limited capacity of the cane commissioner’s office, it could not approach each bank individually to get the payment data as per previous orders of the court.
At this, the LHC directed the SBP on July 15, 2022, to obtain the data from all the banks and transmit the same to the cane commissioner. The data include accounts of the growers as well as payments against cane purchase receipts.
After the court directions, the commissioner also wrote a letter to the SBP governor for the provision of the data to regulate the sugar business and ensure that payments are made to the growers within the time defined in the law.
However, the millers have now begun directly sharing their CPR and payments data with the cane commissioner’s office, says an official. At least half a dozen mills have furnished the required details since the July 15 court orders, he adds, requesting not to be named.
