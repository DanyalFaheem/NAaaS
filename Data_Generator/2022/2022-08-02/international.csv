0,"New Zealand reopens borders, but cautious on arrivals",Tourism New Zealand Chief Executive Rene de Monchy anticipates business picking up slowly compared to pre-Covid levels.,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand’s borders fully reopened on Monday, but the return of international visitors and students is only expected to start with a trickle following the lifting of Covid-based travel restrictions.
New Zealand reported 52,538 cases of the coronavirus over the last seven days yet is ready to re-start welcoming back visitors.
The final phase of its borders reopening began at midnight local time on Sunday with the maritime border and all overseas visitors allowed to submit visa applications.
However, Tourism New Zealand chief executive Rene de Monchy anticipates business picking up slowly compared to pre-Covid levels.
“The return of international tourism is expected to take time as people across the globe gain travel confidence,” he said.
“Tourism New Zealand is working hard to encourage visitation from key markets to boost the recovery of tourism and support the country’s economy.” Tourism including visiting cruise liners, the first of which is expected to dock in Auckland around mid-August, and international students used to be big money makers for New Zealand’s economy.
Before Covid-19 struck, tourist spending generated $40.9 billion (US$25.7 million) for the country’s coffers over the 12 months up until March 2020.
Over the same period, tourism made a direct contribution to New Zealand’s gross domestic product (GDP) of $16.4 billion, which equates to 5.5 percent.
While tourist officials hope the allure of New Zealand’s spectacular scenery can entice back visitors, the education sector is hopeful foreign students will also return in pre-pandemic numbers.
International students used to bring in around $5 billion per year, making it New Zealand’s fourth largest export earner, but that figure plummeted in 2021.
Before the pandemic struck, Auckland’s Macleans College hosted about 300 foreign students.
Principal Steven Hargreaves told Radio New Zealand that he wished they could have accepted applications months ago so students could have started returning on Monday.

1,Fuel crisis affects electricity supply in Bangladesh,The South Asian nation boasts an electrification rate of 97pc — meaning nearly all of its population has access to electric power.,"DHAKA: Robiul Islam, 29, sits in the dark at his home in the Kalurghat neighbourhood of Chattogram city, suffering through yet another power cut, as Bangladesh struggles with costly and inadequate natural gas imports amid a global hike in energy prices.
“Over the last two months, we are seeing power outages that we have not seen in quite a few years,” Islam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone.
The South Asian nation boasts an electrification rate of 97pc — meaning nearly all of its population has access to electric power — and has increased its total power generation capacity to 25,700 megawatts (MW), against peak demand of about 15,000 MW.
But since June, the country has seen a return of frequent power outages, or  “load-shedding”, as the government tries to keep down rising fuel costs.
Nasrul Hamid, state minister for power, energy and mineral resources, wrote in a Facebook post that with energy prices soaring on the world market due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Bangladesh is experiencing a shortage in its gas supply that is hampering electricity generation. But observers say the roots of the crisis go back way before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to an oil and gas squeeze.
Bangladesh’s power sector has increasingly relied on imports of fossil fuels, including Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) which is a  “very volatile commodity” that risks becoming too expensive for poorer importing countries, said Simon Nicholas, a researcher at the US-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).
The share of Bangladesh’s power generated from natural gas stands at about 60pc, with a quarter of that gas imported.
Experts have called for more exploration and expansion of gas production at home to reduce reliance on imported fuels.
The Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB) has also faced financial pressure because of the over-capacity it created through costly support for independent power producers (IPP) in the private sector.
They receive capacity payments from the government — a set fee based on the amount of power that plants can generate — even when they remain idle.
Nicholas said that in the fiscal year 2020-21, the cost of electricity purchased from IPPs represented over half the PDB’s total operating expenses for the first time.
In that year, the government also made capacity payments of 132 billion taka ($1.40 billion) to the IPPs and paid out an equivalent amount of subsidies to state-owned power utilities.
The government launched austerity measures two weeks ago, including scheduled load-shedding, controls on air-conditioning use and reduced working hours to ease pressure on fuel imports.
But power outages and energy price hikes will nonetheless drive up business costs, said Rizwan Rahman, president of the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Electricity and other energy, including diesel and gas, accounts for 15-20pc of production costs across the main energy-intensive industries, especially textiles, cement, steel, leather and plastic products, he added.
Electricity prices went up both in 2019 and 2020, he noted, while gas tariffs recently rose by nearly 23pc — which will in turn drive up power costs further.
“The frequent and unpredictable tariff hikes undermine industrial efficiency and production,” he said, adding that this deters foreign and local investment.

2,EU court gives mixed guidance on migrant rescue boat case,"BRUSSELS: The EU’s top court said on Monday that officials can detain migrant rescue ships, but only if they can...","BRUSSELS: The EU’s top court said on Monday that officials can detain migrant rescue ships, but only if they can prove there is a real risk to health, safety or the environment, in mixed guidance on a case testing Europe’s response to refugees.
German campaign group Sea Watch launched a legal challenge after Sicilian port authorities detained two of its vessels that had rescued migrants in the Mediterranean and taken them to Sicily in 2020.
Italian judges hearing the complaint asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for guidance on the case that goes to the heart of disputes over how to respond to the tens of thousands of people risking the crossing from Africa every year.
Sea Watch, which patrols the Mediterranean to pick up migrants in distress — a practice which some European states say encourages migration — is arguing that the port authorities exceeded their authority by detaining the vessels.
The Sicilian ports of Palermo and Empedocle argued at the time that they had searched and detained the vessels on the grounds that they were overcrowded and not registered for search and rescue operations, according to the ECJ. The Luxembourg-based EU court delivered a mixed ruling which could support arguments on both sides of the case.
It said port authorities have the right to check and detain ships under certain circumstances, though the mere fact that a vessel is carrying people rescued at the sea does not offer sufficient grounds for that.
“The number of persons on board, even if greater than that which is authorised, cannot therefore, in itself, constitute a ground for a control,” the court said in a statement.
It also suggested, however, that regularly running search and rescue operations using ships certified for cargo - as was the case for the Sea Watch vessels - could provide sufficient grounds for port authority controls. Sea Watch welcomed the ruling, saying it provided legal security for NGOs and  “a victory for sea rescue”.
“The fact that port state controls can continue to take place on NGO ships is a good thing,” it said.  “They are intended to ensure ship safety, which is important to us. Arbitrary controls, on the other hand, must finally come to an end.”  There was no immediate reaction from the Sicilian port authorities.
The ECJ ruling sets out the current state of European law on the issue. But it will be up to the Sicilian court to rule if the specific circumstances in these cases justified the actions by the port authorities.
Around 61,000 people have completed the crossing this year and an estimated 938 have died on the route, according to data from the UN refugee agency UNHCR.

3,Year’s largest wildfire claims two lives in California,"The McKinney Fire, the largest in the state so far this year, has ravaged 55,493 acres in the Klamath National Forest.","YREKA: Hundreds of firefighters were battling a fast-moving forest fire in northern California on Monday which has killed two people and forced thousands to evacuate their homes.
The McKinney Fire, the largest in the state so far this year, has ravaged 55,493 acres (22,500 hectares) in the Klamath National Forest near the border with Oregon, CalFire said.
The fire was zero percent contained on Monday morning as searing temperatures and gusty winds hampered the efforts of the more than 850 firefighters deployed to combat the inferno.
California and other parts of the western United States have been ravaged by huge wildfires in recent years, driven by years of drought and exacerbated by a warming climate.
The Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office said firefighters found two people dead inside a burned-out car on Sunday in the driveway of a home in the community of Klamath River. Speaking on ABC News, Sheriff Jeremiah LaRue said firefighters suspected the pair were caught in the swift-moving fire as they tried to flee.
California Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency in Siskiyou County, and more than 2,000 residents of the rural area are under evacuation orders.
A heatwave with temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), tinder dry terrain and thunderstorms packing strong winds are complicating the efforts of firefighters battling the blaze.
“Fire growth is expected to spread in all directions,” the Klamath National Forest service said in a statement.  “Warning for thunderstorms and lightning. Gusty outflow winds of 30 to 50 mph (50 to 80 kph) will be possible near thunderstorm cells.” According to the Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office, the fire has destroyed more than 100 structures — including homes, a grocery store and a community center — in the area surrounding Yreka, though it has not yet encroached upon the town of about 7,800 people.
“Surrounding areas should be ready to leave if needed. Please don’t hesitate to evacuate,” the county sheriff tweeted.
The McKinney fire is California’s largest wildfire so far this year — though it remains much smaller than last year’s Dixie Fire, which burned nearly one million acres.
Yreka resident Larry Castle told the Sacramento Bee newspaper that he and his wife had packed up a few possessions and their three dogs to be ready to leave, as other fires in recent years had taught them the situation could turn  “very, very serious.” Search and rescue teams evacuated 60 people who had been hiking the area’s popular Pacific Crest Trail, according to the sheriff’s department in Jackson County, Oregon.
CalFire said the cause of the McKinney fire was still under investigation.
The US Forest Service said thick smoke had helped to limit the fire’s growth on Sunday, but also meant that firefighters’ aircraft were  “mostly grounded.” The fast-spreading blaze comes just days after the Oak Fire near Yosemite National Park destroyed dozens of buildings and forced thousands to evacuate. California, which is facing a punishing drought, still has months of fire season ahead of it.
Other parts of the world have also faced intense wildfires this year, as scientists say climate change is making heatwaves more frequent and more intense, increasing the risk of fires.
In Portugal, a blaze broke out in the Mafra area, north of Lisbon, at the weekend while in France at least four firefighters were seriously injured and motorways were closed. Also over the weekend, hundreds of firefighters battled a blaze in eastern Germany, with four people injured.

4,Pelosi’s Asia tour kicks off under Taiwan cloud,SINGAPORE: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday kicked off an Asia tour that has been shrouded in secrecy...,"SINGAPORE: US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday kicked off an Asia tour that has been shrouded in secrecy following an escalation in tensions with China over Taiwan.
With no word if Pelosi will visit the island, she stopped first in Singapore, where Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong urged her at a meeting to strive for  “stable” ties with Beijing.
Her itinerary also includes Malaysia, South Korea and Japan, but a possible Taiwan visit has dominated attention in the run-up. Reports about a plan to visit the island have enraged Beijing and caused unease in the White House with President Joe Biden trying to lower the temperature.
Beijing considers self-ruled Taiwan its territory — to be seized one day, by force if necessary — and said it would regard a Pelosi visit as a major provocation.
Pelosi’s office confirmed her Asia trip in a statement Sunday once her plane was in the air, following days of US media speculation and the speaker refusing to confirm her itinerary.
“The trip will focus on mutual security, economic partnership and democratic governance in the Indo-Pacific region,” it said, referring to the Asia-Pacific.
The statement did not mention Taiwan. But visits by US officials there are usually kept secret until delegations land. And as speculation mounted, both CNN and Taiwan’s TVBS cited unnamed sources Monday to report that Pelosi does indeed plan to include the island on her Asia tour.
The Global Times, China’s state-run tabloid, suggested that Pelosi might use  “emergency excuses like an aircraft fault or refuelling” to land at a Taiwanese airport.
“If she dares to stop in Taiwan, it will be the moment to ignite the powder keg of the situation in the Taiwan Straits,” Hu Xijin, a former Global Times editor and now commentator, tweeted. Beijing’s foreign ministry on Monday, warned a visit would  “seriously threaten the peace and stability” of the Taiwan Strait if it goes ahead.
“If House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visits Taiwan, China will take resolute and strong countermeasures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,” spokesman Zhao Lijian said.
“As to what measures, if she dares to go, then let’s wait and see.” Taiwan’s 23 million people have long lived with the possibility of an invasion but the threat has intensified under Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The United States maintains a policy of  “strategic ambiguity” over whether it would militarily intervene were China to invade.
While it diplomatically recognises Beijing over Taipei, it also backs Taiwan’s democratic government and opposes any forced change to the island’s status.
American officials often make discreet visits to Taiwan to show support but a Pelosi trip would be higher-profile than any in recent history.
Taiwan’s government has remained silent on the prospect of a Pelosi visit and there has been minimal local press coverage. “I really hate what the Chinese are doing,” Hsu Ching-feng, a fruit vendor in Taipei, said.

5,Aboriginal MP blasts ‘colonising’ queen in oath of office,The Australian lawmaker raised her right fist in a Black Power salute as she begrudgingly swore to serve the 96-year-old monarch.,"SYDNEY: Aboriginal Senator Lidia Thorpe branded Britain’s Elizabeth II a  “colonising” queen on Monday, as the recently elected lawmaker reluctantly swore allegiance while taking the oath of office.
In a flash of protest, Greens senator Thorpe raised her right fist in a Black Power salute as she begrudgingly swore to serve the 96-year-old monarch, who is still Australia’s head of state.
“I sovereign, Lidia Thorpe, do solemnly and sincerely swear that I will be faithful and I bear true allegiance to the colonising Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II,” she said before being rebuked by a Senate official.
“Senator Thorpe, Senator Thorpe, you are required to recite the oath as printed on the card,” said the chamber’s president Sue Lines.
After reciting the pledge as required, Thorpe declared on Twitter:  “Sovereignty never ceded.”
Australia was a British colony for more than 100 years, a period during which thousands of Aboriginal Australians were killed and communities were displaced wholesale.
The country gained de facto independence in 1901, but has never become a fully fledged republic.
In 1999, Australians narrowly voted against removing the queen, amid a row over whether her replacement would be chosen by members of parliament, not the public.
Polls show most Australians are in favour of being a republic, but there is little agreement on how a head of state should be chosen.
The issue was rekindled at the last election, when noted republican Anthony Albanese was elected prime minister.

6,Sri Lanka seeks urgent help to feed children,COLOMBO: Sri Lanka issued an urgent appeal on Monday to tackle rapidly spreading malnutrition among children as its...,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka issued an urgent appeal on Monday to tackle rapidly spreading malnutrition among children as its economic crisis leaves nine out of 10 people dependent on state handouts.
The Ministry for Women and Child Affairs said they were seeking private donations to feed possibly several hundred thousand children wasting due to insufficient food.
The bankrupt state, grappling with Sri Lanka’s worst economic crisis since independence, was unable to sustain welfare.
“When the Covid pandemic was at its peak, the problem was bad, but now, with the economic crisis, the situation is far worse,” secretary Neil Bandara Hapuhinne told reporters in Colombo.
Hapuhinne said they had counted 127,000 malnourished children among the 570,000 girls and boys below the age of five in mid-2021.
Since then, he estimated the numbers have increased several fold with the full impact of rampant inflation and dire shortages of food and other essentials.
He said the number of people receiving direct state handouts has almost doubled in the past year with over 90 percent of the population now relying on the government for financial help. Hapuhinne said these included about 1.6 million government employees.
Sri Lanka’s inflation was officially measured at 60.8 percent in July, but private economists say it is well over 100 percent and second only to Zimbabwe.
Unicef has also issued an appeal for funding saying that children in Sri Lanka were disproportionately affected by the severe economic crisis.
The country ran out of foreign exchange to finance even essential imports late last year and Colombo defaulted on its $51 billion foreign debt in mid-April.
Under embattled new President Ranil Wickremesinghe, the government is now in bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund.
The country’s 22 million people endure lengthy daily power cuts, long queues for fuel and shortages of staple food and medicines in a country that once had South Asia’s best social indicators.
Last month, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled the country and quit after thousands of protesters angry at the economic crisis stormed his official residence.
Travel ban
Sri  Lanka’s Supreme Court has extended a travel ban imposed on former  president Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother, ex-minister Basil  Rajapaksa, until Aug 4 as they were named respondents in a case filed  over the economic crisis, Ada Derana news website reported on Monday.
On  July 27, the court had extended the ban until Aug 2.

7,Fires increase in Amazon in July,RIO DE JANEIRO: The number of forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon increased by eight percent last month compared...,"RIO DE JANEIRO: The number of forest fires in the Brazilian Amazon increased by eight percent last month compared with July 2021, according to official figures released on Monday, the latest alarm bell for the world’s biggest rainforest.
Satellite monitoring detected 5,373 fires last month, up from 4,977 in July last year, according to the Brazilian space agency, INPE. However, the number was well short of the worst July on record: 19,364 fires in 2005.
July is typically the start of the Amazon  “fire season,” when drier weather fuels more fires — mostly set by farmers and speculators clearing land for agriculture, according to experts. The increase in the Amazon came as major fires raged in California, France and Portugal amid rising temperatures.
This has been a worrying year for fires in the Amazon, a key resource in the race to curb global warming: INPE has detected 12,906 so far, up 13 percent from the same period last year. “It’s only the beginning of the Amazon dry season, when the number of criminal forest fires unfortunately explodes,” said Romulo Batista of Greenpeace Brazil.

8,Tech hub Shenzhen accelerates China’s driverless car dreams,"Shenzhen, a city of 18 million, has now brought in China’s clearest AV regulations.","SHENZHEN: On a busy downtown street three delivery bikes suddenly dart over the pedestrian crossing ahead of the car. On the car’s dashboard they look like small 3D blue blocks from a 1990s video game.
The steering wheel turns itself a notch and the vehicle slows to a gentle halt, while the safety driver looks on from the passenger seat.
The vehicle is one of a hundred sensor-laden robotaxis belonging to start up DeepRoute.ai cruising the dense central Futian business district in China’s southern tech hub Shenzhen, giving 50,000 trial rides to passengers in the last year.
While the United States is regarded as taking an early lead in testing autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, in Shenzhen the industry appears to be changing gears, with trial robotaxis fast becoming a common site.
Baidu Inc’s Apollo unit, Toyota Motor Corp-backed Pony, Nissan-backed Weride, Alibaba-backed Auto X and Deeproute have all been running trials navigating the city’s difficult environment, with frequent jaywalkers and ubiquitous e-scooters.
Shenzhen, a city of 18 million, has now brought in China’s clearest AV regulations. From Monday registered AVs will be allowed to operate without a driver in the driving seat across a broad swath of the city, but a` driver must still be present in the vehicle.
So far, Chinese cities have allowed robotaxis to operate on a more limited basis with permission of local authorities, but Shenzhen’s regulations for the first time provide a crucial framework for liability in the event of an accident.
If the AV has a driver behind the wheel, the driver will be liable in an accident. If the car is completely driverless, the owner of the vehicle will be responsible. If a defect causes an accident, the car owner can seek compensation from the manufacturer.
“If you want more cars, eventually there will be accidents, so these regulations are very important for mass deployment,” said Maxwell Zhou, DeepRoute’s CEO, speaking at the company’s offices in a tech park near the Hong Kong border.
“This is not true driverless but it’s a big milestone.” 
So far the United States has raced ahead in AV trials, with California greenlighting public-road tests from 2014, allowing Alphabet Inc’s Waymo LLC, Cruise and Tesla to rack up millions of miles in road testing.
But China has its foot on the accelerator, with Beijing making AV a key area in its latest five year plan. Shenzhen wants its smart vehicle industry to reach revenues of 200 billion yuan by 2025.
In May last year Cruise Chief Executive Dan Amann warned President Joe Biden that US safety regulations risked the country’s AV industry falling behind China, with the latter’s  “top down, centrally directed approach”.
Deeproute aims to have 1,000 robotaxis with safety drivers on Shenzhen’s roads in the next few years, when more detailed regulations are expected.
But in a city with a state-owned fleet of 22,000 electric taxis from Shenzhen-based BYD, where a 20-km (12-mile) trip costs about 60 yuan ($9), production costs for AVs will need to come down before robotaxis are commercially viable, Zhou said.

The 24-year-old goes door-to-door in a small wooden motor boat in the Audomarois marshes, a wetland region around 45 minutes drive from Dunkirk in northern France.
“We have a map showing where each person lives. So we don’t work with addresses, only names,” said Defoort, who has been in the job for a year and delivers to some 50 inhabitants.
The marshes, renowned for their cauliflowers, are one of a small number of cultivated wetlands in France. Tourists flock to the Unesco-recognised biosphere reserve in the summer months, but winter can be bleak and the community isolated.
“In the winter there are no tourists, there’s no-one, so we’re happy to see the postman,” said local resident Alexandra Dumoulin.
