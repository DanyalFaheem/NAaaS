1,Seven held as probe into death of youth in DHA high-rise begins,KARACHI: Police on Monday took into custody seven persons and launched an investigation to determine whether the...,"KARACHI: Police on Monday took into custody seven persons and launched an investigation to determine whether the death of a young man, who fell from a high-rise building in DHA Phase VIII on early Sunday morning, was an ‘accident’ or not after the victim’s sister lodged a manslaughter case against his friends.  
Adil Masood Khan, 26, fell from the terrace of an apartment in a multi-storey building on Sunday morning and died.
“We have lodged an FIR under Section 322 [qatl-i-bisabab, or manslaughter, of the Pakistan Penal Code] on the complaint of deceased’s sister Varda Masood, who came here from Lahore. We have detained the six friends of the victim as well as the flat owner,” said SSP-South Dr Mohammed Imran Khan. 
He said all the held persons had left the victim unattended and fled after the incident.
The complainant in her statement before the police accused the building administration of not attending her brother or shifting him to a hospital for a considerable period, he added.
“The immediate task before us is to determine as to how he fell...whether it was an accident or his friends pushed him from the terrace with some mala fide intention,” the SSP said.
According to the FIR, the complainant said she lives in Lahore and she got a call from Adil’s friend, Hammad, who informed her about an accident and that her brother was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre. Later, she came to Karachi after she was informed about the death of her brother.
She stated in the FIR that her brother’s friends — Syed Mohammed Ammar, Usman Ahmed, Mohammed Awais, Aziz Ahmed, Ahmed Jamil and Syed Khizr Akbar — had gone to a flat in DHA, Phase-VIII. They got the flat on one-day rent of Rs25,000 from Mohammed Shatba Qazi.
The complainant said all of Adil’s friend abandoned him and fled at 5am on Sunday and they neither informed anyone nor took her brother to a hospital. 
She said the body was lying in an open area for two hours and then the building administration shifted the corpse to a hospital.
“I have strong doubt that one of the friends pushed my brother from the balcony,” she said in the FIR, demanding a legal action against the six friends and the flat owner and building administration.

2,Call for bringing all civic bodies in Karachi under KMC control,Sherry Rehman says Karachi is experiencing unprecedented climate change event.,"KARACHI: Weeks before the local government elections and amid a growing demand for an empowered local government system in Karachi, a six-member committee of the federal government on Monday agreed that the country’s business capital was facing serious flaws in administration of municipal services as the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) controlled not even half of the city.
The fresh thoughts were shared by some key members of the federal cabinet and Prime Minister’s Needs Assessment Committee while talking to the media after visiting different rain-affected areas of Karachi. 
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had formed the special committee to assess damages caused by the recent rains in the country. It is headed by Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman and comprising Federal Minister for IT and Telecom Syed Aminul Haq, Privatisation Minister Abid Hussain Bhayo and three MNAs — Mir Amir Ali Khan Magsi, Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah and Kesoo Mal Kheel Das Kohistani. 
The committee also held meeting with the Karachi commissioner and representatives of the KMC to get briefings about the city’s post-rain situation.

Sherry Rehman says Karachi is experiencing unprecedented climate change event

Talking to reporters, Ms Rehman of the Pakistan Peoples Party said that building resilience in Karachi should be the prime focus of the government as the city had witnessed the worst of disasters during the three monsoon spells. 
She was very clear to share her concerns that only 40 per cent of Karachi was being administered by the KMC and the rest of the city’s municipal administration was run by different institutions including cantonment boards, Defence Housing Authority (DHA), etc.
“What we are experiencing in Karachi is another unprecedented climate change event,” she said. “The city has been brought close to a breaking point and unfortunately, we will see more rainfall during August. Karachi recorded a historic over 600mm of rainfall [in July] and it takes much less than that for urban flooding to happen.”
At this point, Federal Minister Syed Aminul Haq of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan came up with details of the discussion the committee had during its meeting with the commissioner and local government officials.
“This committee has representation of all coalition partners,” he said. “There’s a consensus that the only one-third of Karachi is under KMC [control] and the rest is divided among different institutions including cantonment boards, DHA and others.”
He adds: “It’s a consensual suggestion that all organisations operating in Karachi should be brought under the KMC. We will conduct a short-, medium- and long-term needs assessment and give our recommendations on these lines.”
Ms Rehman was asked about her thoughts on the demand of an empowered local government system in Karachi, where her party has been controlling all major municipal and civic organisations, including the Solid Waste Management Board, Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB), Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA).
“I can’t make announcement in my capacity for an empowered local government [system],” she said. “But obviously we are seeing situation on ground and how bad it is.”
“So we need to come together and cooperate with each other during this difficult time and not indulge in turf wars. All of us present here are from different parties and our objective is to stabilise Karachi and provide assistance to those in need,” she said.
Earlier, she said that the federal government would give compensation to those who lost their loved ones and houses. 
“The committee is on the visit to different cities of Sindh and will compile its report on the damages caused by the recent rains. We have three days to do this job and on the fourth day, we have to submit the report,” she added.
Minister Haq said on the occasion that the sewerage system in Karachi had collapsed and the government should take this issue seriously.
Karachi Administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab informed the meeting that about the performance of the KMC during rains.
Later, the committee and officials visited different areas of city including Tower, Korangi River and other areas.
The committee will also be conducting assessments in the flood-hit areas in interior Sindh.

4,IO’s plea for medical examination of Dua Zehra dismissed,PTA told to take action against YouTubers airing defamatory content against Dua’s family.,"KARACHI: A court on Monday dismissed an application filed by the investigating officer of a case seeking medical examination of teenage Dua Zehra to determine whether she was subjected to a sexual act following her alleged underage marriage.
Zaheer Ahmed, along with his around 20 family members, relatives and friends, has been booked for kidnapping the 15-year-old girl from Karachi and shifting her to Punjab, where her underage marriage was illegally solemnised.
On Monday, Judicial Magistrate (East) Aftab Ahmed Bughio pronounced the order reserved last week on the IO’s application.
The judge observed that the IO, DSP Saeed Rind, had sought permission to take the custody of the minor/victim to a health facility to get her medically examined to see whether or not she had been subjected to any sexual abuse during the period she spent with her purported husband.

PTA told to take action against YouTubers airing defamatory content against Dua’s family

It said that the IO also filed a progress report stating that in his opinion Section 375(v) (rape with or without her consent when she is under sixteen years of age) of the Pakistan Penal Code was attracted in present case, and for that purpose, medical examination of the witness/victim was necessary.
“Refraining myself to discuss the application of Section 375(v), it is hereby held firstly this court is the custodian of the rights of the victim, whose custody had been entrusted to the Child Protection Authority under the order of this court,” the judge wrote in the order.
The court observed that the medical examination at this stage would “achieve nothing, but embracement and offend the victim”.
“For the reasons stated hereinbefore the application moved by the investigation officer through the prosecution for allowing her to take the custody of the victim from the Child Protection Authority for medical purpose is declined in the interest of the victim,” ruled the judge while dismissing the application.
Earlier, state prosecutor Muhammad Younis had argued that there was apprehension of the commissioning of rape of the victim when she was in the custody of the suspect.
Advocates Jibran Nasir and Zaheer Hussain, counsel for the complainant Syed Ali Mehdi Kazmi, had also supported the IO’s request arguing that refusal to permit the IO to get the victim medically examined would amount to restraint of his powers to investigate the matter.
The counsel argued that the court may not interfere into the matter of investigation by putting any restriction to the victim’s medical examination. The father of the victim, who was natural guardian, was ready to give his consent to such medical procedure, the counsel said.
On the other hand, counsel for suspect Zaheer vehemently opposed the plea arguing that the same had been filed with mala fide intentions. “If any case is made out against the accused is under the Child Marriage Restraint Act, and no rape is alleged by the victim in her statement, which is direct evidence,” he submitted.
He argued that the medical examination of the victim at this belated stage would achieve nothing, but cause embracement and discrimination against the victim. 
Action against YouTubers ordered
The Sindh High Court on Monday directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) to take action against some YouTubers for airing defamatory content against Dua’s father and his family.
A single-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi also put the defendants on notice for Aug 28 and restrained them from airing scandalous material against the plaintiff and his family members.
Mehdi Ali Kazmi through his lawyer filed a lawsuit in SHC and referred to transcripts of numerous contents already aired on social media by private defendants and argued that all contents were based on defamatory, malicious and baseless material against the plaintiff and his entire family and damaging their respect and honour in the society.
The bench observed that points raised by the lawyer required consideration and issued notices to all the defendants.
It directed PTA to initial legal action against the private defendants strictly in accordance with law and to submit a comprehensive report within 15 working days.

Furnishing replies and statement to the written and verbal queries of the lawmakers during Question Hour in the house, Mines and Mineral Minister Mir Shabbir Ali Bijarani said the provincial government wanted to develop mineral sector, but currently mining was closed at Karoonjhar due to protest by local people. 
He said that there was no illegal mining or extraction of the granite stone from Karoonjhar Hills, adding that following reports of illegal mining, a committee was formed to probe the matter. 
“The committee visited the area and held a public hearing on Oct 15, 2021 and ascertained that there was no illegal mining of the granite stone in the area,” he added. 

Minister says mines and mineral department earned Rs854.66m revenue in 2021

The minister said the committee heard the public complaints and reviewed the concerns of local people. “It was decided by the committee to stop mining in the area for the time being,” he said and added that the Supreme Court had stopped the mining in 2011 when protests against mining erupted. 
He said the mining work would be started as soon as the matters were settled and the benefit of the granite would be given to the local people. 
“According to the information we received, there are 20 billion tonnes reserves of granite stone,” the minister said and added that mining would be allowed in 150,000 acres, while the remaining 50,000 acres had been declared protected area as it comprised of forest, wildlife and archaeological sites.

6,"82,000 get admission in first year on Class IX results","Last year, 120,000 students got admission in city’s 176 colleges","KARACHI: For the first time in the history of the province of Sindh, admissions for Intermediate first year have been given on the basis of Class IX results even before the release of Class X results.
It was said that the change in the admission policy was made to save the valuable time of students. But in doing so, Director General of Colleges Dr Mohammed Ali Manjhi was unable to inform everyone about it. So when he released the admission list for first year in subjects including Science Pre-Medical, Engineering, Computer Science, Commerce and Arts for government colleges and higher secondary schools, they showed far less students than usual.
Due to lack of awareness about the admissions in Intermediate first year, or Class XI, based on class nine results, there were very few admissions in colleges because students were awaiting their Class X results before applying to their colleges of choice. 
In fact, when compared to last year where there were some 120,000 admissions in 176 colleges and higher secondary schools in Karachi, only 82,000 admissions could take place within the given deadline.

Last year, 120,000 students got admission in city’s 176 colleges

Not knowing the change in admission policy, some 38,000 students either did not download admission forms from the colleges website or if they did, they did not know what to write in the space provided for the marks as they didn’t yet know of their Class X grades and they weren’t aware that they were to supply their Class IX grades instead. 
All govt, many private schools reopen 
All  government and some private schools which follow the Sindh education  department reopened after two-month-long summer vacations here on  Monday.
Many private schools also remained closed as they had  decided a few days ago to extend their holidays by another 15 days in  view of heavy rains and also Muharram holidays and Independence Day.  They decided to reopen on August 15, which also falls on Monday.
Earlier,  it had already been decided in the Sindh Education Department’s  Steering Committee meeting held in February that all education  institutions will observe summer vacations from June 1 to July 31 this  year. The admissions for high schools were also to take place during  this time with new classes starting from August 1.
As the  government stuck with its earlier decision of reopening of schools as  per the announced schedule, there were many parents seen doing their  last minute back-to-school shopping buying new books, notebooks,  stationary, new uniforms, shoes, socks, etc., over the weekend.

8,Rabbani laments conversion of country into ‘national security state’,"KARACHI: An interactive session, titled “Jinnah’s Vision of Pakistan: 75 years of independence and it still...","KARACHI: An interactive session, titled “Jinnah’s Vision of Pakistan: 75 years of independence and it still remains a distant dream” was held on Monday at Ziauddin University. 
By outlining a few resolutions and establishing distinctions between Pakistan’s past and present, former Senate chairman Senator Raza Rabbani explains Jinnah’s vision.
He said: “Seventy-five years down the line we have a welfare state which was converted into a national security state and therefore the priorities in 1947 of a welfare state, from a federation state we were converted into a state where there was One Unit... we were converted into a state which at that time talked about parity and we became a central state from a federal state from a parliamentary democracy.
“There have been times when the constitution was suspended, we have had a military dictatorship, and there have been times when the presidential system of government has been in effect. These are the many stages to democratic dominance. According to me, this is the goal of Jinnah, and this is where we are sadly right now. From a state that has cultural variety because it is naturally, ethnically and culturally varied. We have a governing class that turned Pakistan or attempts to convert Pakistan into a homogenous state,” he continued.
Taking the historical point of view in mind, Institute of Historical and Social Research Director Prof Dr Syed Jaffer Ahmed said: “Without understanding the historical context and social milieu of Jinnah, it is impossible to comprehend his vision. Even surpassing one of the greatest leaders, Mustafa Kamel Ataturk, I think Jinnah was the greatest Muslim leader of the 20th century.” 
“Jinnah was also a modernist who was influenced by western ideas of democracy. While serving in the Indian Legislative Assembly, he repeatedly urged the British rulers to grant our parliament the same level of autonomy as their own parliamentary system. In a brief speech on August 11, he referred to the Pakistani parliament as the supreme parliament of Pakistan, using the phrase three times,” he added.
Senior journalist, writer and social activist Ghazi Salahuddin said: “There are some issues that have not been resolved.” 
“We claim that Jinnah gave us a secular state, but it also interferes with Pakistan’s movement. Few students attend general history lessons in schools and universities, and those who do tend to overlook Pakistani history and poorly transmit it. Instead, you should revisit history, comprehend it, and form your own opinion of Pakistan,” he stated. 
Earlier, ZU Pro-chancellor Dr Nida Hussain, in her welcome speech, said that Pakistan was going through its worst political, constitutional and economic crisis, and it’s a conversation that was now a part of everyone’s daily life.
In concluding remarks, ZU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Syed Irfan Hyder said the fact that none of the countries similar to Pakistan were democratic and independent was proof that we neglected the ‘point in the room’ during this conversation. 
“Although we live in a post-colonial world, we were still subject to the dictates of the point in the room,” he added.

11,Growers say soaring farm input prices have made wheat cultivation unviable,Call for declaring all rain-affected districts ‘calamity-hit’,"HYDERABAD: The Sindh Abadgar Ittehad (SAI) has expressed its grave concern over the present state of the agriculture sector, which is backbone of the national economy, and said rising cost of input has undermined it. It said recovery of fuel price adjustment (FPA) on the already paid electricity bills from growers is unjust.
SAI president Nawab Zubair Talpur and other office-bearers including Mohammad Anwar, Mir Zafarullah, Mohib Marri and Saifullah Gill told a joint press conference here on Monday that the organisation’s executive committee held its meeting earlier in the day and express its grave concern over state of the agriculture sector.
Mr Talpur said that the cost of agriculture input had increased manifold which had undermined this sector. He said that FPA of May was going to be recovered from growers in July’s bills at a rate of Rs9.30 per unit and it was learnt that FPA for the month of June would also be recovered in August bills. He said growers would resist this unjust recovery. He noted that the per unit tariff now stood at Rs24-Rs25.
With the differential of FPA, growers would now be receiving Rs100,000 per month bill against their actual bill of Rs25,000. He said they were already bearing highly expensive diesel and the manifold electricity tariff would make farming unaffordable. “The urea cost is skyrocketing; it is available at Rs2,700 per bag while Nitro Phosphate cost stood at Rs8,200 per bag,” he pointed out, saying that these were essential inputs.

Call for declaring all rain-affected districts ‘calamity-hit’

The SAI leaders were of the view that cultivation of crops had now become unviable which was evident from the fact that DAP’s cost stood at Rs15,000 per bag against its actual price of Rs9,700. They said DAP had always been imported and only urea was produced locally. They said last year it was sold at Rs5,600 per bag. Oil price had registered an unprecedented increase.
They said that in the previous wheat season, government was importing the commodity at Rs4,000 per 40kg and farmers were given Rs2,200 per 40kg as support price. They said that government would bear Rs11bn losses on import of wheat alone. They said farmers would find it hard to grow wheat this year and they might give up its cultivation to switch over to mustard crop. 
The SAI leaders demanded that paddy price should be fixed at Rs2,500 and cotton crop at Rs10,000 per 40 kg.
They said that had farmers been given Rs,4,000 as the wheat support price, its production would have increased substantially and government would not have to import wheat today. They said last year’s shortage of urea had affected wheat production.
They said that surplus sugar should be exported, and regretted reports that millers would pay Rs250 per 40kg to sugar cane growers which was fixed last year. They said given present market conditions, the price of Rs500 should be fixed for sugar cane crop.
They said that all those districts that had been affected by rains should be declared calamity-hit areas. 
They noted that non-perennial canals were given water supplies on July 12, therefore, these canals should be provided water till Jan 12, 2023 so that growers could take care of their paddy crop.
