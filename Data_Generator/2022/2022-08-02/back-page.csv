KYIV: The first shipment of Ukrainian grain left the port of Odessa on Monday morning, Turkey announced, as Kyiv said the “brutal” shelling by Moscow of the southern city of Mykolaiv had killed an agriculture tycoon.
The blockage of deliveries from warring Russia and Ukraine — two of the world’s biggest grain exporters — has contributed to soaring food prices, hitting the world’s poorest nations especially hard.
Last month both sides signed a landmark deal, with assistance from Turkey and the United Nations, to enable Ukraine to resume its grain exports.
“The ship Razoni has left the port of Odessa bound for Tripoli in Lebanon,” the Turkish ministry said in a statement.

Washington to send weapons worth $550 million to Ukraine

“It is expected in Istanbul on Aug 2 (today). It will then continue its journey after it has been inspected in Istanbul,” the statement added.
Other convoys would follow, respecting the maritime corridor and the agreed formalities, it said.
The Joint Coordination Centre, the organisation overseeing the grain exports, said the Razoni is carrying “over 26,000 metric tonnes” of maize.
New weapons to Kyiv
The United States announced Monday a new tranche of weapons for Ukraine’s forces fighting Russia, including ammunition for increasingly important rocket launchers and artillery guns. The new $550 million package will “include more ammunition for the high mobility advanced rocket systems otherwise known as HIMARS, as well as ammunition” for artillery, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.
The assistance includes 75,000 rounds of 155 mm artillery ammunition, a statement from the Pentagon said.
“To meet its evolving battlefield requirements, the United States will continue to work with its allies and partners to provide Ukraine with key capabilities,” the statement said.
This brings the total of military assistance committed to Ukraine since President Joe Biden took office to more than $8.8 billion, according to the Pentagon.
Previous weapons assistance from Washington to Kyiv has included counter-artillery radars, Javelin anti-tank missiles, Soviet-made helicopters, shells and light armored vehicles.
Kirby also hailed the first shipment of Ukrainian grain that left from the port of Odessa on Monday.

1,"US, allies slam ‘dangerous’ Russian nuclear rhetoric","“Nuclear weapons, for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes,"" they say; Putin says no winners in nuclear war.","

WASHINGTON: The United States and its nuclear allies rebuked Russia on Monday for “irresponsible and dangerous” talk about possibly deploying nuclear weapons, as a review of the keystone nuclear treaty opened at the United Nations.
“Following Russia’s unprovoked and unlawful war of aggression against Ukraine, we call on Russia to cease its irresponsible and dangerous nuclear rhetoric and behavior, to uphold its international commitments,” said the US, France and Britain in a statement.
“Nuclear weapons, for as long as they exist, should serve defensive purposes, deter aggression, and prevent war. We condemn those who would use or threaten to use nuclear weapons for military coercion, intimidation, and blackmail,” they said.
The call was issued as leaders met at the United Nations in New York for the 10th review conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which came into force in 1970.

World faces danger ‘not seen since Cold War’, warns Guterres; Putin says no winners in nuclear war

It comes as concerns are rising about the spread of nuclear technology, especially in Iran and North Korea, and China’s rapid expansion of its nuclear arsenal.
While five leading nuclear powers are among the 191 states party to the pact, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea are not.
“The NPT has reduced the risk of a devastating nuclear war, and further reduction of that risk must be a priority for all NPT states parties and for this Review Conference,” the joint statement said.
It said that Iran, currently in negotiations to limit its nuclear development, “must never develop a nuclear weapon”, and called on North Korea to halt its nuclear-related tests and launches.
In a separate statement, US President Joe Biden called on Russia and China to demonstrate their commitment to limiting nuclear arms.
Russia should demonstrate its willingness to renew a separate bilateral nuclear arms reduction pact, the New START Treaty, when it expires in 2026, Biden said.
“My administration is ready to expeditiously negotiate a new arms control framework to replace New START,” he said.
“But negotiation requires a willing partner operating in good faith. And Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression in Ukraine has shattered peace in Europe and constitutes an attack on fundamental tenets of international order.”
Turning on to China, Biden said Beijing has a responsibility “to engage in talks that will reduce the risk of miscalculation and address destabilising military dynamics”.
“There is no benefit to any of our nations, or for the world, to resist substantive engagement on arms control and nuclear non-proliferation,” Biden said.Meanwhile, a Russian foreign ministry source expressed puzzlement on Monday about a proposal from US President Joe Biden to negotiate a new arms control framework to replace the New START Treaty when it expires in 2026.
But in his address to at the NPT conference, Russian President Vladimir Putin said there could be “no winners” in a nuclear war and it should “never be unleashed.” Putin insisted that Russia remained faithful to the treaty’s “letter and spirit.”
Since the start of Moscow’s military intervention in Ukraine, Putin has made thinly veiled threats hinting at a willingness to deploy Russia’s tactical nuclear weapons, which Russian military doctrine holds can be used to force an adversary to retreat.
UN chief’s warning
Also on Monday, UN head Antonio Guterres warned that the world faced “a nuclear danger not seen since the height of the Cold War” and was just “one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation”.
“We have been extraordinarily lucky so far. But luck is not a strategy. Nor is it a shield from geopolitical tensions boiling over into nuclear conflict,” Guterres said at the start of a conference of countries belonging to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
“Today, humanity is just one misunderstanding, one miscalculation away from nuclear annihilation,” he said, calling on nations to “put humanity on a new path towards a world free of nuclear weapons.”
Guterres’s comments came at the opening 10th review conference of the NPT, an international treaty that came into force in 1970 to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
The meeting, held at the UN’s headquarters in New York, has been postponed several times since 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It will run until August 26.
Guterres said the conference was “a chance to strengthen” the treaty and “make it fit for the worrying world around us,” citing Russia’s war in Ukraine and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the Middle East.
“Almost 13,000 nuclear weapons are now being held in arsenals around the world. All this at a time when the risks of proliferation are growing and guardrails to prevent escalation are weakening,” Guterres added.

2,TikTok Creator Portal launched in Pakistan,"Portal is a series of videos that will provide guidance, tips and tricks to help creators maximise their in-app presence.","KARACHI: TikTok laun­ched its Creator Portal in Pakistan on Monday, a one-stop shop for educational res­o­urces on content creation for creators on its platform.
The portal, which can be accessed on the TikTok account @tiktokcreatorspakistan, is a series of videos that will provide guidance, tips and tricks to help creators maximise their in-app presence and take their videos to the next level.
It will help creators dive deeper into modules such as storytelling, community bu­i­l­­ding and creative effects, aimed at inspiring and diversifying content creation on the platform.
A TikTok statement said: “Creators are the heart and soul of TikTok. They make the application a welcoming place where millions of people come for entertainment, learning and fun, and TikTok offers anyone a chance to reach an audience, without needing to be a celebrity or social influencer with a large following. While becoming a creator is as simple as tapping a few buttons, thriving as a creator takes time, dedication and some education. With the different tools, analytics, effects and creative ideas to balance on a TikTok account, making a strategy for creating content can be daunting.
Only a day ago, a young man lost his life while recording a TikTok video in a canal near Phiphara village in Mandi Bahauddin, as recent months have seen an increase in violent incidents involving TikTokers.

3,Iran ‘optimistic’ on deal after EU tables proposal,"Will probably see new round of talks, says foreign ministry spokesperson; US sanctions 6 companies for helping Iranian oil trade.","TEHRAN: Iran said on Monday that it remained “optimistic” about a possible revival of the 2015 nuclear deal, even as the head of the country’s atomic energy organisation expressed his country’s reluctance to pursue the weaponisation of nuclear materials.
Iran has the technical capability to produce an atomic bomb but has no intention of doing so, the Fars news agency quoted Mohammad Eslami as saying.
Iran is already enriching uranium to up to 60% fissile purity, far above a cap of 3.67% set under Tehran’s now tattered 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Uranium enriched to 90% is suitable for a nuclear bomb.
Eslami reiterated comments made by Kamal Kharrazi, a senior adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in July.

US sanctions six companies for helping Iranian oil trade

Separately, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani told a news conference that Tehran “remain[ed] optimistic that the negotiation process will lead us to a logical and reasonable outcome” after the European Union tabled a proposal aiming for a compromise in the talks stalled since March.
The comment came after EU foreign policy chief and coordinator of the nuclear talks between Iran and world powers, Josep Borrell, last Tuesday submitted a new draft text and urged the different sides of the negotiations to accept it or “risk a dangerous nuclear crisis”.
Borrell said the draft text includes “hard-won compromises by all sides” and “addresses, in precise detail, the sanctions lifting as well as the nuclear steps needed to restore” the 2015 pact.
“We will probably see a new round of negotiations,” Kanani added, but noted that “it depends entirely on the willingness of the other side, especially the American side.” The 2015 agreement gave Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its atomic programme to guarantee that it could not develop a nuclear weapon — something it has always denied seeking.
ANWAR IQBAL ADDS FROM WASHINGTON: The US on Monday designated six entities for allegedly facilitating illicit transactions of Iranian petroleum and petroleum and petrochemical products, the key sources of revenue for the Iranian government.
The action has serious consequences for countries like Pakistan that are looking at the option to buy oil and gas from Iran. The allegedly violators on the US Department of State’s list include Pioneer Ship management PTE LTD, a company that managed one liquified petroleum gas tanker, for serving as the commercial manager for a vessel that transported Iranian petroleum products.
The Golden Warrior Shipping, Co. Ltd., has been designated for providing logistical support to the Iranian petroleum trade. The department also identified the vessel Glory Harvest as a block property of Golden Warrior Shipping Co. Ltd.
Additionally, the US Department of the Treasury designated four entities that support Iran’s Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industry Commercial Co., a US-designated entity, for continuing the sale of Iranian petroleum products and petrochemical products abroad.

4,Tensions soar as Iraq gears up for rival groups’ protests,BAGHDAD: Thousands of Iraqis took to the streets of Baghdad on Monday in counter-protests as rival supporters of...,"

SUPPORTERS of the Coordination Framework, a coalition of Shia parties, protest near Baghdad’s Green Zone on Monday.—Reuters

 
BAGHDAD: Thousands of Iraqis took to the streets of Baghdad on Monday in counter-protests as rival supporters of Moqtada Sadr extended their occupation of parliament into a third day.
Almost 10 months after Iraqis went to the polls, a political standoff pits two key factions of the Shia political scene, between Sadr with a following of millions, and the powerful pro-Iran Coordination Framework.
“The people will not allow a coup,” read placards held by supporters of the Coordination Framework as they gathered on a main street leading to the Green Zone, the home of parliament, which Sadr’s supporters have been occupying since Saturday.
“It is the parliament of the people, of all Iraqis, not the parliament of a select group,” said 25-year-old protester Ahmed Ali, condemning the storming of government institutions.
Police fired water cannon at crowds in a bid to prevent them from crossing a bridge leading to the Green Zone, inside which thousands of Sadr supporters maintained their protests, waving flags and carrying placards of their leader.
Sadr’s supporters on Saturday breached the normally high-security Green Zone — also home to government buildings and embassies — in protest at a prime ministerial nomination by the Coordination Framework.
Defend the state
Followers of the Coordination Framework urged supporters not to enter the Green Zone, saying their objective was to “defend the state and its legitimacy”.
After some two hours, the counter-demonstration announced they were dispersing. “They wanted to show their political strength, to show that they too have a base that can take over the Iraqi street,” said political scientist Ihsan al-Shammari, from the University of Baghdad.
In multi-confessional and multi-ethnic Iraq, government formation has involved complex negotiations since a 2003 US-led invasion toppled military dictator Saddam Hussein.
In this case, the protracted political deadlock has left the country without a government, a new prime minister or a new president.

5,Liz Truss leads Downing Street race,Lagging rival Rishi Sunak vie to make up lost ground with a plan for future tax cuts.,"LONDON: British Conservative frontrunner Liz Truss won another heavyweight endorsement on Monday as party members began a month of voting to decide the next occupant of 10 Downing Street, the seat of the UK’s prime minister.
Truss’s lagging rival Rishi Sunak vied to make up lost ground with a plan for future tax cuts — and potentially to host a future women’s football World Cup in Britain after England’s “Lionesses” — their women football team — won the European championship.
The Tory contenders were going head to head later on Monday in a members’ hustings, in the southwestern city of Exeter — the second of 12 such events before the winner is announced on September 5.
Sunak, a polished debater, needs to recapture momentum after Truss steamed into a strong polling lead on a platform of immediate tax cuts to address Britain’s worst cost-of-living crisis in generations.
Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi joined other luminaries of Boris Johnson’s cabinet in backing the foreign secretary against Sunak, his predecessor in the Treasury.
Sunak’s resignation from the scandal-tainted Johnson’s cabinet helped spark a ministerial exodus that forced the prime minister out last month.
As they began receiving postal and online ballot forms, a large minority of the roughly 200,000 Tory members is said by pollsters to nurse a grievance against Sunak — one shared by Johnson.
The prime minister is not formally taking sides, but has told aides that he intends to give his successor some words of advice, “whoever she may be”, The Sunday Times reported.

6,The Palestinian family that needs ‘Israeli permission’ to enter own home,"Several legal battles have been fought in Israeli courts, with the family winning the ‘right’ to a small strip of land in 2012.","BEIT IJZA: An eight-metre-high me­tal fence surrounds the Gharib family home in the occupied West Bank. To reach, it they must pass through a gate remotely controlled by Israeli security forces.
Since Israel seized the territory in the Six-Day War of 1967, a Jew­ish settlement has sprung up on surrounding land claimed by the family leaving them isolated in their single-storey house on the edge of the Palestinian village of Beit Ijza.
“I don’t know when this will end,” sighed Sa’adat Gharib. “No one knows the pain my children are suffering.” For years the family home stood amid swat­hes of farmland, but now it lies behind a yellow gate, controlled by Israeli soldiers, who also patrol a narrow bridge overlooking the eight-metre-high fence.
“During these years we’ve had a tough life,” said Gharib, 40, who works for the Palestinian Autho­rity in nearby Ramallah.

Several legal battles have been fought in Israeli courts, with the family winning the ‘right’ to a small strip of land in 2012

When he was a child, the Jewish settlement of Givon Haha­dasha was built partially on land he says belonged to his family.
Decades on, the high fence separates the Gharib house from the Israelis’ red-roofed homes and gardens. A communal space for the settlers, with a children’s slide, has been placed a few metres (yards) away.
Settlements are deemed illegal by most of the international community, a judgement Israel rejects.
The Gharib family has fought numerous legal battles in Israeli courts, in 2012 winning the right to a small strip of the land they claim.
“The settlers built a parking lot and a park, and we’ve needed the security forces to implement (the decision) and retrieve it for 10 years,” said Gharib.
The yellow gate leading to the house was installed back in 2008, Gharib said, and at one point the family had to hold up their IDs to security cameras to cross the threshold. “(We) appealed to the high court... and the court permitted us to have the gate open all the time,” Gharib said.
“Disputes have broken out bet­w­een us and the settlers,” said Gharib, who lives with his wife and four children, as well as his mother.
Avi Zipory, a resident of the settlement, said he would prefer it if the “unpleasant” fence around the house was not there.
“Two courts unanimously deci­ded that the area and his house are within Jewish land,” said the 70-year-old. “We didn’t want to de­s­­troy his house... (he is) not rea­dy to accept any alternative plan, (even) other land and a lot of mo­­ney, that’s why we had to continue this separation fence,” he said.
Gharib has hung blue tarpaulins to create a screen between his home and the Givon Hahadasha settlement. “So that the kids can play without being bothered by the settlers and fearing them,” he explained. Gharib said the situation has affected his children, particularly when there are clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces nearby.
“My daughter couldn’t sleep all night, for five hours, and she was afraid of the security forces that were stationed at the door of the house,” said Gharib, recalling one incident.
Despite the difficulties, he still strives to harvest the family’s olive trees. To do so, he said he has to coordinate with the Israeli security forces and take a circuitous route through the neighbouring Palestinian village of Bayt Duqu. Once there, Gharib said he must wait “an hour or two” for soldiers to open another gate.
Gharib remains determined to stay on his land: “This is our land which my father inherited from my grandfather. We will not sell it to anyone for all the money in the world.”
