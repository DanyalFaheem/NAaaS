He also accused the Imran government of following a foreign agenda.
“Our [Pakistan Democratic Movement] government is making efforts to steer the country out of economic crisis and put it on the path of development and prosperity. These efforts will take time to bear fruit,” the JUI-F leader told reporters after attending a ceremony held here to offer Fateha for former accountant general of Pakistan Iftikhar Ahmed Khan, who is the uncle of party leader Mohammad Ahmad Khan, here.
Mr Fazl, who is also the head of the PDM, said four months were not enough for the current government to address all crises.
He said all PDM members had unanimously decided that the government would complete it term and general elections would be held on time.
The JUI-F leader said the PDM parties would contest the forthcoming by-elections together.
He alleged that the Imran government had rolled back the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project and was active to break the country.
Mr Fazl said the current government was trying to clear the mess created by its incompetent predecessor (PTI).
“Imran Khan is blackmailing national institutions. On one hand, he welcomes the results of by-polls in Punjab but on the other, his party is getting resolutions passed against the Election Commission of Pakistan in the Punjab and KP assembles,” he said.
The JUI-F leader also accused the former premier of trying influence the ECP’s coming decision in the PTI foreign funding case.

A decision to this effect was taken during a meeting held in the City Council Hall here on Monday with Zubair Ali in the chair. 
A large number of local council representatives participated.
On the occasion, Mr Ali said the provincial government was depriving the local government representatives of their rights by issuing rampant directives for making them subservient to deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners. That, he said was not only tantamount to conspiracy against the elected mayors, tehsil and union council chairmen and councilors, but also indicated that the system was being deliberately failed.
He said the local body system could flop if the representatives were weakened. He said they were granted powers, but whatever authority they had was being snatched from them.
Union council chairmen of ANP, PML-N, JUI-F, JI and PTI and representatives of other political parties also attended the meeting, and announced their full participation in the protest.
In the next phase, they said they would stage a protest in front of the Chief Minister’s House, the office of the local government minister and at Banigala residence of PTI chairman Imran Khan.

5,"Suspected rapist, killer of girls a psychopath: Peshawar police",IGP says DNA test links 20-year-old embroider with offences.,"PESHAWAR: Declaring the suspected rapist and killer of minor girls a psychopath, the Peshawar police on Monday said the DNA testing of the 20-year-old accused linked him with the offences.
Provincial Inspector General of Police Moazzam Jah Ansari told reporters at the Central Police Office here that the DNA testing by the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) had confirmed that the arrested embroider had sexually assaulted three minor girls before killing two of them.
“We [police] have received the DNA test results from the PFSA that show a positive DNA match from the samples collected from girls to the accused’s,” he said.
The Peshawar police had arrested the young man last Thursday for sexually assaulting three girls and killing two of them on three consecutive Sundays in different parts of the cantonment area. The crimes were committed on July 3, 10 and 17.

IGP says DNA test links 20-year-old embroider with offences

The IGP said the police would work ‘very hard’ for the accused’s conviction.
“I’ve directed the capital city police officer of Peshawar to take the prosecutor on board from the start of the trial as the latter has to plead the case before the court,” he said.
Mr Ansari said the police had done their job and were optimistic that the accused would be declared guilty.
He said a specialist was being hired for the psychiatric evaluation of the accused.
The police chief said initial interrogation suggested that the accused was a psychopath and that he was molested in his childhood with the incident leaving an indelible imprint on his memory.
He said the investigation also suggested that there could be an ‘element of vindictiveness in the assaults’.
Mr Ansari said the accused had once tried to strangulate his mother after having an argument over his marriage.
He said the accused had no social encumbrance and gave nothing from his earnings to the family and spent all that on his activities.
“We have many such characters around, who do not bow to moral, ethical and legal bounds, so the accused is a psychopath,” he said.
The IGP said the police would try to get the accused’s physical remand extended for interrogation in connection with two assault and murder cases other than the one in which he was in custody.
He said it was not immediately clear if the accused was involved inother similar acts.
Mr Ansari, however, said the accused informed investigators aboutanother assault attemptby during a stay in Rawalpindi.
When asked about targeted killing of the police personnel in the province, he said many groups were involved in such attacks.
“We [police] have identified the killers of two police personnel in Mattani area of Peshawar as members of a militant outfit. They have nothing to do with the banned Islamic State’s Khorasan chapter.
Regarding the attack against police in Nowshera, the IGP said it was carried out by criminals and not militants. He said 63 policemen had been martyred in terrorist attacks during the current year.
When asked about the incidents of extortion, Mr Ansari said the culprits were using Afghan, UAE and Saudi SIMS cards to make WhatsApp calls for the purpose, so the police couldn’t locate them.
He said in such cases, the police had approached the relevant authorities in the countries, where those mobile numbers were registered, for blocking under the ‘mutual legal assistance’.
The IGP said the police had killed 101 terrorists in the current year, while those involved in all major attacks had been traced.
He declared the overall security situation in the province challenging but said it was not alarming.
Mr Ansari said after a decline for four-five years, the incidence of terrorist attacks had surged in the province.

12,Health dept yet to get emergency funds for dengue prevention,Officials fear outbreak of disease due to rains and power outages,"PESHAWAR: The finance department is yet to release emergency funds for prevention and control of dengue fever amid fear of outbreak of the disease due to torrential rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Sources said that situation with regard to the mosquito-borne ailment was under control but could snowball into major outbreak in the wake of monsoon season and suspension of power supply due to which people were compelled to store water and provide breeding grounds to mosquitoes.
So far, the province has recorded 213 confirmed cases in 22 districts, including 45 in high-risk Peshawar, 39 in Dera Ismail Khan, 29 in Khyber and 24 in Haripur but the situation shows that the province is endemic to the virus.
As per record, in 2017, the health department registered 25,243 dengue cases, 1,019 cases in 2018, 7,082 cases in 2019, 69 cases in 2020 and 10,615 cases in 2021. “It means the province is endemic to the virus and requires measures to prevent outbreaks,” sources said.

Officials fear outbreak of disease due to rains and power outages

In February, Chief Secretary Dr Shahzad Khan Bangash sanctioned Rs170 million emergency funds for dengue control and prevention after health department made a presentation regarding the situation in the province.
However, the funds have not been released and health authorities at the district level are concerned that they require procuring bed nets, medicines, anti-mosquito spray and other items to take appropriate steps and prevent outbreak of the disease.
“We are receiving supplies from the routine funds from the health department but we need more supplies to be able to put brakes on outbreaks as monsoon rains are providing breeding spaces for larva, which ultimately become mosquitoes, the carriers of the virus,” a senior health official at one of the high-risk district told Dawn.
He said that the torrential rains were creating water pools, which required to be sprayed to eliminate larva. “To do this, we desperately need funds,” he added.
Sources said that government approved dengue implementation plan early in the current year. “Release of emergency fund is in process of approval at planning and development and finance departments and timely availability of funds will further improve once the emergency budget is released,” they added.
They said that Supreme Court had issued special directives to finance department to release the funds at the earliest. However, they said that release of funds was still awaited.
“Cases are mild. Only few patients are admitted to hospitals for observation for a few hours then discharged. No mortality has been recorded so far,” said sources.
They said that heavy rains and warm and humid hot weather were providing favourable conditions for breeding of dengue larva. They said that people also needed to keep drinking water covered to reduce breeding sites either by treating the standing water with insecticides, larvicides and removal of unnecessary standing water.
Sources said that health department required resources for preventive measures as the dengue season would continue till October. Currently, the department needs to strengthen larva surveillance and training of staff on case management to minimise the risk of outbreaks.
In 2017, dengue killed more than 70 people in the province, mostly in Peshawar. The government has been allocating special funds to Covid-19 and polio. It should release the emergency funds already approved for prevention of dengue outbreaks.
Health Secretary Amer Sultan Tareen told Dawn that they had sent request to the finance department to expedite the funds. He hoped that the funds would be released soon.
“The situation is under control but we are taking all measures as per the dengue implementation plan to prevent the outbreak. We are in touch with the district health authorities as well as other line departments in this regard. The high-risk would soon get additional funds as per their requirements,” he said.
