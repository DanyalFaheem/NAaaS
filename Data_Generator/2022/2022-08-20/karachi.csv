Memon told journalists during a visit of Tandojam that the government had released Rs3 million each to deputy commissioners to combat post-rain situation. 
Sindh Minister for Irrigation Jam Khan Shoro visited rain-affected areas in Hyderabad to review situation after weeks of heavy rain and monitor relief operation. Shoro asked the administration officers to ensure quick drainage of rainwater from low-lying areas by utilising all available resources.  
Sindh Minister for Energy Imtiaz Shaikh admitted to widespread damage from heavy rain and said Sindh government would compensate people for losses caused by rain. 
The minister told a press conference in Larkana that the commissioner would carry out survey of losses in rain-related incidents.  
Sindh Minister for Forest Nawab Taimoor Talpur said after visiting flood-affected areas in Umerkot that the government would not collect any taxes this year.  
At a meeting, members of general public disputed the minister’s claim that 17 relief camps had been set up and said that no camp had been established so far. Those who could afford had shifted to rented 
premises while others were still stuck in marooned villages, they said. Qaumi Awami Tehreek president Ayaz Latif Palijo told 
protesters in Qasimabad that the Rs3m each the Sindh government had released to districts would be stomached by DCs, ACs and mukhtiarkars. He asked the government to declare emergency in the province.

2,"Who owns restaurants, tea shops on Seaview beach, SHC asks CBC","Cantt board, DHA told to file details of all operational and soon-to-be operational commercial entities in four weeks.","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday directed the counsel for the Cantonment Board Clifton (CBC) and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) to file a complete list of commercial entities operating on the Seaview beach.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi said that a comprehensive report of the entities, operational or likely to be operational, from Nishan-i-Pakistan Park to Clock Tower must be submitted by the lawyers for the CBC and the DHA within 30 days.
The bench directed that a complete description of commercial entities with their ownership to be specified in the report.
The SHC passed these directives during the hearing of a petition filed in February by some individuals and non-governmental organisations against alleged commercialisation of the seafront from Nishan-i-Pakistan Park to Village Restaurant (Now Clock Tower) in the Phase-V of the DHA.

Cantt board, DHA told to file details of all operational and soon-to-be operational commercial entities in four weeks

The petitioners had submitted that an environmental tribunal had already set aside the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) approval accorded by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) to the proposed commercialisation.
They further submitted that the CBC planned to commercialise Seaview beach and the project proposed to be spread over 20 acres, which entailed development of one-km-long stretch of Seaview beach while mushrooming of eateries would be allowed to construct small and large restaurants and the project in question would certainly restrict the fundamental rights of citizens to enjoy beach as the planned facilities were meant for well-to-do population only.
The petitioners had asked the court to declare Seaview beach from Nishan-i-Pakistan to Park Clock Tower an open natural beach and free from all artificial modifications, development and construction and also sought directive for removal of rubble and garbage dumped on the beach without approval of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
Earlier, the CBC and DHA in their counter affidavit had argued that they were not carrying out any commercial development on Seaview beach and only plantation process was being undertaken for beautification of the beach.
They further contended that no restaurant was functioning on the beach and in order to facilitate public entertainment only small kiosks were operating, which were controlled by the DHA and maintained by tenants of such kiosks. 
They maintained that such kiosks had no effect on the environment.
Sepa in its comments contended that the CBC had voluntarily filed IEE to Sepa and the same was approved accordingly and maintained that the proposed project was not a mega scheme, thus not falling in EIA category and there was no legal requirement for conducting environmental assessment.
It further submitted that the environmental tribunal had remanded the matter of IEE to Sepa with directions to decide the same afresh in accordance with law.
The petitioners in a rejoinder to counter affidavit of the CBC argued that the IEE report negated disclaimer of the CBC carrying out any commercial activity and it had been shown that this project was part of a long-standing strategy of the DHA to commercially develop Seaview beach.
They contended that the IEE for the commercial exploitation of entire Clifton waterfront was prepared in 2008 and it was highly likely that the CBC and the DHA would eventually charge an entry fee to allow access to the area in question as this had been a normal practice in many amenity areas of the DHA, including Zamzama Park and Nisar Shaheed Park while hockey stadium in Khadda Market and the football ground at Rahat park had been contracted out to private businesses.
They argued that the CBC’s own proposal showed variety of construction activities, including pavement, two beach decks, artificial wood flooring seven restaurants, 15 tuck shops and 15 hawkers and street stalls to be built within the project area.

3,Sindh govt says criteria for hiring VCs not changed,Secretary Rahimoon says application format has been changed in summary for regular appointment of seven to eight VCs.,"KARACHI: While a proposal does exist to appoint bureaucrats as vice chancellors of 
universities, a senior government official claimed on Friday that the Sindh government has so far not made any changes in the criteria for appointment of VCs.
Commenting on media reports alleging that the government had decided to appoint bureaucrats as vice chancellors, Universities and Boards Secretary Muhammad Mureed Rahimoon explained to Dawn that there was no change in the appointment of vice chancellors and “we are still following the Higher Education Commission (HEC) criteria”. 
He said that the HEC criteria included that the candidate had a doctoral degree and had to his or her credit at least 15 research articles.

Secretary Rahimoon says application format has been changed in summary for regular appointment of seven to eight VCs

About reports of an approved summary, he said it pertained to the regular appointment of seven to eight VC at public sector universities.
“We have just changed the format [of application] and brought it in a tabulated form. The approved advertisement for appointment of vice chancellors will likely appear next week,” the secretary said.
However, he declined to share the approved summary.
About the concerns pertaining to the likely appointment of bureaucrats as vice chancellors under the new advert, he said: “Under no law, the government can stop a bureaucrat from applying for the post if he or she holds a doctoral degree and has 15 research papers to his or her credit. Our aim is to find the best suitable person for the post and that could be anyone.”
Sources said the proposal to appoint a bureaucrat as vice chancellor was not new and followed concerns among certain government circles that professors lacked the administrative experience to efficiently run universities and, therefore, the condition for a PhD degree and research papers should be waived off.
Meanwhile, the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association-Sindh chapter and the Pakistan Medical Association have strongly condemned the alleged government move with the former warning of agitation, if the move wasn’t withdrawn.
“We strongly condemn the suggestion of appointing bureaucrats as vice chancellors. The appointment must be according to the HEC criteria under which only a professor could become a vice chancellor,” Prof Shah Aliul Qader heading the federation-Sindh and Karachi University Teachers’ Society said, adding that the appointment of bureaucrats would destroy the universities.

Additional Sessions Judge (South) Aslam Hussain Khowaja pronounced his order reserved on an application filed by one Shabbir Shafqat under Section 22-A of the criminal procedure code (CrPC), seeking issuance of directives for the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to take action against Ms Malik under the cyber crime laws.
The judge noted: “On the perusal of record, it appears that during lifetime of deceased Aamir Liaquat Hussain, his wife Dania Malik made the photos/videos viral which were morally objectionable.”
However, he opined that since the late MNA’s daughter had already lodged a complaint with the FIA’s cyber crime wing and a four-member team was conducting an inquiry, the instant application on the same issue was not maintainable.
In the plea, applicant’s counsel Aamir Jamil Virk had argued that Ms Malik had shared indecent videos of her spouse on social media, which defiled the sacred relationship of husband and wife.

People are caught in a massive traffic jam which developed in Qayyumabad on Friday because of inundation of roads and public protests held against K-Electric in different localities over ‘inflated bills’ and frequent unannounced outages.—PPI

 
KARACHI: Frustrated by frequent and prolonged loadshedding and increase in electricity tariff, angry consumers of the K-Electric on Friday held protests at the main and other offices of the power utility.
A large number of residents of Hijrat Colony, Sultanabad and other adjoining areas gathered at the KE’s main office on the Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road and chanted slogans against the utility for resorting to prolonged loadshedding throughout the day and even in the night-time.
Traffic remained clogged for hours as the protesters blocked the Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road near Shaheen Complex.
However, a KE spokesman said that the period of loadshedding in Hijrat Colony and adjacent areas was as per the schedule of June 30. “In the current situation, shortfall is maintained for 24 hours, and loadshedding is still mandatory,” he claimed.
Kamran Khokhar, a resident of Hijrat Colony, said that the power utility was carrying out prolonged loadshedding in the locality despite several protests. “We are now tired of taking to streets as there seems to be no use of protest,” he added.
A resident of Sultanabad, Arshad Khan, said that power supply remained disrupted throughout day and night with intervals in additional to the announced loadshedding schedule of the KE for the locality. “The power supply is disconnected anytime, though there is no local fault,” he added.
Later, the protestors dispersed after KE officials held negotiations with them assuring that unannounced loadshedding was not being carried out in their respective localities.
Like the ongoing loadshedding, the protests against the KE has also become a routine feature as the offices of the power utility are being surrounded in many parts of the city, but to no avail as there has been no respite in power outages.

A couple and their four minor children travelling in a cab drowned in the flooded Malir river on link road in Memon Goth on Aug 17 after heavy flow of water swept away the vehicle. The car was found floating on Thursday morning and bodies of two of the four siblings were recovered.
Police and rescue services on Friday said that out of the seven drowned persons, bodies of the five — the father, Muhammad Zeeshan Ansari and his four children — had been recovered.
Bodies of the two sons — Ebad and Ayan — were fished out on Friday. The bodies of Muhammad Moosa, 10, and her younger sister, Hamna, 7, were recovered on Thursday evening.

8,Wooing the bridal behemoth?,KARACHI: The atmosphere was taut with expectations. What would the newly coined Hum TV’s ‘Bridal Festive by...,"KARACHI: The atmosphere was taut with expectations. What would the newly coined Hum TV’s ‘Bridal Festive by Kashee’s’ (BFK) be like when it came to delivering on the promise of a well-presented and executed show? 
The hype had been building up for quite a few days, ever since Hum TV announced the single-day event. After all, it was the first-of-its-kind ramp show this year, since 2022 started some eight months ago. Although rumours were that some (read most) from the elite fashion fraternity deliberately chose to stay away and disassociate with BFK, the fervour had reached fever-pitch by the time of the show started late evening on Thursday at the marquee of a reputed hotel.
Social media was abuzz with backstage preps and videos of the models all dolled up and attired in bridal finery, ready to take to the stage. The lounge area and red carpet pulsated with a life of its own with bridal installations, floor-mounted chandeliers and stuffed peacocks perched on stands.
The ramp show, which started more or less at the slated time, was divided into three main segments: Mehndi & Mayun, Rukhsati and Valima, and featured a plethora of celebrities and actresses mostly associated with the Hum Network. A stunning Reema Khan was the show-stopper towards the end of the show.
Kashee’s salon has created its own distinct niche and identity in Karachi’s burgeoning bridal industry ever since it opened its doors for business, and it added bridal trousseau designing services to its portfolio some years ago. Since then the brand has expanded to urban Punjab as well. Kashee’s also participated in Hum TV’s Bridal Couture Week some time back but BFK is the first time that it has partnered with the channel for a solo show.
To be perfectly honest, the outfits presented under the BFK umbrella lacked innovation in design or the effort to introduce new trends in bridal wear, and toed the very safe and already well-trodden commercial lines and avenues overall. The outfits catered to the average customer’s commonly placed aesthetics, and the bride who chooses to play it safe and is unwilling to experiment with her looks on her wedding day. These bridals can be found commonly in the city’s sprawling shopping centres at bargaining prices.
Finally, to say that the Hum TV Bridal Festive by Kashee’s redefined, or even revolutionised in any way the showing of bridals, would be a gross overstatement. What it did do was showcase commercially viable bridal wear bestsellers as well as define and introduce new trends in bridal makeovers and hairstyles. Where we go from here is pretty much up to us, or the brides-to-be.

9,‘One nation one system’ for police envisioned,KARACHI: The computerising of policing in Punjab has opened eyes and doors for the entire country to replicate the...,"KARACHI: The computerising of policing in Punjab has opened eyes and doors for the entire country to replicate the system and form an integrated policing network for the rest of the country, too. The initiative was made possible through the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication (MOITT). 
In this regard, an inter-provincial conference on ‘Crime Analytics Smart Policing In Pakistan (CASPP) For a Digital Age’ was held at a local hotel here on Friday in which the Inspector Generals of Police (IGPs) of Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) aired their views about the CASPP to further help the IT Ministry in streamlining the system for phase two, which is taking it to the entire country’s police for a consolidated one nation, one system.
They also explained the different cores of the project, including Police Station Record Management System, Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS), Complaints Management System (CMS), Criminal Record Office (CRO), Police Khidmat Markaz (PKM), Hotel Eye, Tenant Registration System and Unified Platform.
There will be 25 police station registers, including an automated FIR register as part of the Police Station Record Management System (PSRMS). 
HRMIS is an automated HR system of the police departments which is integrated with all the allied systems, including the PSRMS. It has resulted in automated order generation, transfers, postings, etc. 
The CMS is a hassle-free complaint submitting process for the public at the police station level. 
The CRO is a system for criminal record management and identification of criminals by using biometrics, physical appearance and previous crime history. 
The PKM centres have been established as a confidence building measure between the police and the public. 
The Hotel Eye is a web application developed to log check-ins and check-outs at hotels. It saves personal data of the visitors, including their CNIC and other mandatory details. In case a criminal record checks in, this system facilitates the police by sending a notification for prompt action as it is integrated with Nadra, PSRMS and CRO. 
The Tenant Registration System keeps a digital record of tenants facilitating in registration process and monitoring of tenants. This system is integrated with CRO and PSRMS, so it helps the police in searching records of suspects.
A Unified Platform is to help MoITT’s initiative as all provinces will be connected though this single platform leading to smooth inter-provincial coordination. It will help the provinces in making effective and robust policing rules and regulations at the national level and above all, it will assist in better decision-making. 
Looking to expand the CASPP, it was also important to share the issues, however, minor, faced by the Punjab government in computerising policing, while also taking into account the suggestions from the other provinces’ police departments. 
Balochistan Police Makran Range DIG Azfar Mahesar said that they also needed an anti-vehicle lifting system as many stolen vehicles can be easily crossed over through the border in Balochistan. “We need to have the major routes and highways on that system for the purpose. We have the facility and training for doing this, but we also need uninterrupted electricity for this so we need a solar system,” he said. 
Sindh Information Technology DIG Captain Pervez Ahmed Chandio spoke about the province’s plans, which also include search through databases such as ‘Talash’, Online FIR, HRMIS, etc. 
It was also said that while the one nation, one system for the entire police of the country would be good and beneficial for all, it was also felt that there was hesitation among different people regarding the sharing of data. But they should understand that data sharing is important for the success of such systems and that there was a secure network in place for it. Therefore, they should learn to trust more.
Khurram Iqbal of AJK Police said that they have set up E-Police Posts or EPP, which helped them control crime during the popular cricket event, the Kashmir Premier League, last year during which they made some 100 arrests. 
“EPP is deployed even now, and it is all thanks to the IT Ministry,” he said. 
In his statement regarding CASPP, Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Syed Amin-Ul-Haque said that the Government of Pakistan strives to improve its citizens’ quality of life and economic well-being by ensuring availability of accessible, affordable, reliable, universal and high quality ICT services.
“The Crime Analytics and Smart Policing project was initiated and funded by Ministry of IT and Telecom and executed by Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB). The main objective of the project was to roll out the technology initiatives of police in the provincial capitals and develop an analytics umbrella for predictive policing,” he said. 
“In the first phase, the different core systems have been implemented in the provincial capitals of Pakistan, including Karachi, Islamabad, Gilgit, Muzaffarabad and Quetta, under MoITT’s CASPP initiative,” he added. 
Highlighted the overall impact of the CASPP, the Federal IT Minister stated that the establishment of the first national criminal database with 1.5 million criminal profiles and 6.5m recorded crimes initiated the first integrated criminal justice system and developed the first artificial intellgence-based predictive policing systems along with improved service delivery to the public. 
“Provision of a platform for research and development and the integration of all systems will help coordination between various departments to help in effective decision-making, improved e-Governance, reducing paper work, etc. With these great improvements within the police departments, great response has been received from the public and MoITT plans to increase the scope of these initiatives in other cities across Pakistan,” he stated.

I think there is hope for the world,” Dr Aamir Khalil representing the Four Paws’ team said at a ceremony held on Friday at the PMA House. 
The event was organised by the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) in honour of the team which has recently conducted two major tusk surgeries at the zoo, provided treatment to Safari Park elephants suffering from cracked and overgrown nails, footpads and abscesses, and gave aftercare instructions to the local staff. 
Speaking at the event, Dr Khalil, who leads the eight-member team, said there was a lot of potential for future collaboration and the global animal welfare group was ready to continue assistance to improve elephants’ quality of life. 
“We found the local staff very cooperative. They are highly motivated and keen to learn, and this is what matters,” he said in reply to a question. 
Asked about the tissue/tusk samples the team has collected during the surgeries, he said the local zoo vets would be examining the tumour sample taken from Noor Jehan during the surgery whereas the team would examine the tusk pieces collected during Madhubala’s operation.  
Dr Frank Goritz and Dr Thomas Hilderbrandt shared details of the complicated surgical interventions performed on the zoo elephants under a unique procedure.  
In their speeches, Dr Tipu Sultan, Dr Sonia Naqvi and Dr Qaiser Sajjad expressed their gratitude on behalf of society in general and Karachiites in particular for treating the elephants. 
“We are all extremely impressed by the team’s efforts. I think the government should look into the problems affecting well-being of zoo animals and take immediate steps for their welfare,” Dr Sajjad noted. 
Four Paws’ team members Dr Marina Ivanova, elephant trainer Mathias Otto and Agnieszka were also in attendance. The guests were presented with shields, a traditional Sindhi cap and Ajrak at the end of the event.

He issued the directive while presiding over a special meeting at CM House here to review the losses and damage caused by the continuing heavy rains and the measures taken by the provincial government.
The CM informed him that as per a rough estimate, the rehabilitation would cost Rs40 billion which would cover compensation to the affected people for the loss of their damaged crops and shops, and repair of road network, bridges and sewerage system. 
He said that the provincial government lacked adequate resources, therefore, the federal government would have to help the Sindh government in the rehabilitation of affected people.

Unprecedented downpour, related incidents have left 166 people dead, 573 injured in Sindh, says Murad

The PPP chairman assured the CM that he would talk to the prime minister in this regard. 
Mr Bhutto-Zardari observed that the unprecedented and prolonged five spells of monsoon rains had badly affected people in 13 districts of the province. PPP’s priority was to protect the affected people in the first phase and then rehabilitate them with a relief package, he said. “We cannot leave them under the open sky; the provincial government must mobilise all its resources to support the affected people by providing them tents, mosquito nets, drinking water, cooked and uncooked food, healthcare faculties and also ensure vaccination of their cattle,” he added.
The meeting was attended among others by Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah, Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Sohail Rajput, PSCM Fayaz Jatoi, Karachi Commissioner Iqbal Memon, Senior Member Board of Revenue Baqaullah Unnar, LG Secretary Najam Shah, Finance Secretary Sajid Jamal Abro, Irrigation Secretary Sohail Qureshi and PDMA director general Salman Shah. Sindh Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro and commissioners of Hyderabad, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur and Larkana attended the meeting through video link.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari noted that the downpour had submerged thousands of villages and towns in 13 districts. “It [downpour] has affected and rendered thousands of people homeless, therefore their proper care is the responsibility of our government in Sindh,” he said, and directed the chief minister to send the party MPAs to their respective constituencies for helping the affected people.
‘Calamity-hit areas’
Briefing the PPP chairman, the CM said that during the last 24 hours, Sanghar had received 319mm rainfall followed by Umerkot (172 mm), Shaheed Benazirabad (162mm), Qambar-Shahdadkot (158mm), Tando Allahyar (150mm), Hyderabad (142mm), Khairpur (135mm), Larkana (127mm), Naushahro Feroze (112mm) and Tharparkar (105mm).
He said that widespread thunderstorm/rain with heavy to very heavy falls at scattered places and extremely heavy falls at isolated places was expected all over Sindh in the coming days. Therefore, he said, flood warning had been issued across the province.
Mr Shah said that the heavy rains had so far claimed 166 lives and left 573 people injured. He added that 2,849 cattle had perished, 47,399 houses were damaged (6,489 completely and 40,910 partially), and standing crops over an area of 810,683 were washed away or damaged. 
The CM informed the party chief that 1,002kms of 256 roads and 18 bridges had been damaged by the rains in the province, adding that the provincial government had declared nine districts ‘calamity-hit areas’ and would include four more districts in the list.
According to the CM, around 1.053 million people had been affected and 432,658 displaced. “We have set up 61 relief camps where 1,169 people have been shifted and those who are not ready to leave their homes have been provided tents, mosquito nets, beds and such other things through the PDMA,” he said.
Dewatering ordered
The PPP chairman was informed that LBOD (Left Bank Outfall Drain) was in a dilapidated condition right from Sanghar and Shahdadpur up to Kaloi. It was pointed out that Mirpurkhas had received 36 hours of continuous rain on August 18 and was badly affected along with Kot Ghulam Mohammad and its adjoining areas.  
The meeting was told that the Latifabad and Qasimabad talukas of Hyderabad district had submerged. Dewatering machines have been installed to drain out rainwater. Jamshoro, Manjhand, Sehwan taluka, Johi (Dadu district), Tando Mohammad Khan and Tando Allahyar have also been badly affected.  
Similarly, Sukkur and Khairpur districts have received heavy rains where the entire date and cotton crops have been destroyed. 
Larkana, Qambar-Shahdadkot, Shikarpur and Kandhkot-Kashmore district have also been affected and surveys to assess the losses and damage are being conducted there. The rains have wreaked havoc in Shaheed Benazirabad, Naushahro Feroze and Umerkot districts as well, according to Mr Shah.
Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari directed the irrigation minister to keep visiting the barrages and vulnerable points of different embankments to monitor the situation.
He also directed the chief minister to get the entire road network in Karachi improved and its sewerage system repaired as soon as the rains were over.
He also directed the local bodies to start anti-mosquito and anti-bacteria sprays in the areas where water had accumulated.
