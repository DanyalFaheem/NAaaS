0,Khokhar stays defiant after being re-elected as PHF president,Refuses to take the blame for the deterioration of country’s hockey.,"KARACHI: In a head-on with the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB), the country’s governing body for sports, incumbent Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) president retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar was re-elected unopposed for another four-year term in the elections held here at a local hotel on Friday.
PHF’s acting secretary Syed Haider Hussain was elected as secretary.
According to a PHF press release, the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) was represented by Ahmed Ali Rajput while Shahid Ali attended on behalf of the Sindh Sports Board (SSB).
The elections were held under the supervision of PHF’s chief election commissioner Chaudhry Mohammad Riaz.
Addressing a press conference at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) that started 45-minutes behind schedule, Khokhar refused to take the blame for the deterioration of country’s hockey by answering in negative when asked whether would it have been wise had he stepped down by accepting the greenshirts’ continuous failures in global-level competitions.
To a question pertaining to the ongoing tug-of-war between the PHF and the PSB, he said he has abided by the PHF constitution.
He attributed Pakistan team’s non-participation in the Pro-League in 2019 to paucity of funds which resulted in the country’s relegation in the FIH world rankings. “The funds were already approved but a change of guard of the government halted its release,” he maintained.
He recalled that Pakistan was ranked 12th in world rankings when he took over as PHF chief back in 2015. Presently, Pakistan is ranked 18th.
“Pakistan hockey team is a well-knit side and will rise again in a year’s time,” he remarked.
In response to a question about the accountability of certain officials regarding financial irregularities during the last seven years, Khokhar said he has carried out an inquiry against former secretary Shahbaz Ahmed and will soon submit it to the FIA.
He disclosed about having arranged Rs24 million from his own resources to keep the ball rolling besides meeting his travelling expenses from his personal pocket.
The PHF president said he will bring in former players having no vested interests to the fore for the betterment of the game.
He termed extension of the lease of the Abdul Sattar Edhi Hockey Stadium and allocation of Rs1500 million for its renovation as a major breakthrough. The first tranche of Rs450 million is expected to be released soon.
It is pertinent to mention that the 30-year lease of the stadium will expire next year.    
Following are the PHF office-bearers:
Retired Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar (president); Saeed Khan, retired Maj Gen. Tariq Haleem Suri, Amjad Satti and Syeda Shehla Raza (vice-presidents); Syed Haider Hussain (secretary); Syed Zahir Shah (joint secretary); Shahid Pervaiz Bhindara (treasurer); Tanzeela Amir Cheema (women’s representative)
Women’s wing: Syeda Shehla Raza (chairperson), Sana Jamali (vice-chairperson), Tanzeela Amir Cheema (secretary)

1,South Africa thrash England in Lord’s Test,England were dismissed for 149 in their second innings before tea on the third day.,"LONDON: South Africa inflicted England’s first defeat of the ‘Bazball’ era as they won the first Test by a crushing innings and 12 runs with more than two days to spare here at Lord’s on Friday.
England were dismissed for 149 in their second innings before tea on the third day, with the Proteas effectively winning the game in six sessions after most of Wednesday’s first day was lost to rain.
Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj struck twice before fast bowler Anrich Nortje followed up with a superb spell of three wickets for no runs in 10 balls as the Proteas, leaders of the World Test Championship table, took a 1-0 lead in a three-match series.
England had won all four of their previous Tests under a new leadership of captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, after whom ‘Bazball’ is named.
Each of those wins, however, came after batting aggressively in the fourth innings, rather than having to set a total and before this match South Africa captain Dean Elgar questioned whether a policy of all-out attack would work against his formidable bowling line-up.
“Anrich Nortje’s spell just broke the back of the England innings,” said Elgar at the presentation ceremony after the Proteas had skittle out the home side in under 37.4 overs.
South Africa now have a couple of extra days rest before the second Test at Old Trafford starts on Thursday.
Stokes, who took over as skipper from Joe Root with England having won just one of their 17 previous Tests, said it would be  “silly” for him to be anything other than disappointed.
Maharaj, who didn’t bowl at all in England’s meagre first innings 165, sparked Saturday’s slump by removing Zak Crawley and Ollie Pope during a remarkable pre-lunch spell of 2-6 in three overs.
Maharaj, brought on as early as the seventh over in a tactical coup by Elgar, struck with just his third ball when he had Crawley lbw for 13 after the struggling opener missed a sweep.
Pope, whose 73 was the lone fifty of England’s first innings, was then lbw to Maharaj off the last ball of the session as he looked to work the ball leg-side.
England, 38-2 at lunch, were 57-3 soon afterwards when paceman Lungi Ngidi had star batsman Joe Root caught in the slips by Aiden Markram for six.
Jonny Bairstow came into this match having scored four hundreds in as many Tests only to be caught behind for 18 off express quick Nortje on Friday.
Left-handed opener Alex Lees, dropped on four, had ground out an unconvincing 35 when he too edged Nortje to wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne.
Two balls later, England’s 86-5 became 86-6 when Ben Foakes fell for a duck, a careless waft outside off stump presenting opposing gloveman Verreynne with another simple chance.
Broad, with little to lose, hooked Nortje for six in sunny conditions ideal for batting despite taking his eyes off the ball.
But fast bowler Kagiso Rabada, who took an excellent 5-52 in the first innings, got Broad with a clever slower ball the tailender chipped to Elgar at mid-off to end an entertaining 35 -- the joint top score of the innings.
England then lost two wickets in two balls, Matthew Potts bowled by Marco Jansen before Stokes (20) was brilliantly caught in the deep by Maharaj off player of the match Rabada.
Towering left-arm quick Jansen, who earlier on Friday made 48 in South Africa’s 326, wrapped up the match emphatically by clean bowling last man James Anderson.

LONDON: Captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum promised to persist with England’s new attacking approach to Test cricket, dubbed  “Bazball”, despite being handed a heavy innings defeat on Friday in the first Test against South Africa.
England were emphatically thumped by South Africa on Friday.
Stokes, however, said there would be no change when the second Test starts at Old Trafford next Thursday.
“Absolutely not. You know, I look at captains before me and they were always going to get criticised at times about the way that they wanted to play, and that’s just part and parcel of the job,” he said.
“We know well that when we perform to the capabilities that we’re capable of, then we can go out and put on an incredible performance, like everybody’s seen in the four games before.
“This is absolutely not a wake-up call or anything like that. It was just unfortunate we’re unable to execute in the way that we want to play this week,” said Stokes.
McCullum echoed the captain, rejecting the suggestion that the England batsmen might have been too cavalier against a strong bowling line-up.
“I don’t think so. I think they were perhaps a touch timid. We approach the game with a clear mentality about the way we want to play and we want to be the best versions of ourselves. It’s not always going to work,” he said.
“As we said at the time, you’ve got to buckle up for the ride. It’s not nice at times like this but we’ll come back strong.”

3,Rizki announced as Pakistan head coach ahead of SAFF Women’s Championship,The championship will kick off in Nepal from Sept 6.,"KARACHI: The worst-kept secret is out.
The Pakistan Football Federation Normalisation Comm­ittee on Friday finally revealed the national team’s coaching panel for SAFF Women’s Championship with officials who had been involved in the trials as well as the training camp since the last month being named on it.
Adeel Rizki will be the head coach with Walid Javaid Khan assisting him and Ehsanullah training the goalkeepers.
Since the trio was seen conducting the trials, the PFF NC had constantly denied that they had already been hired for the SAFF Women’s Championship until Friday when they were unveiled in a video posted on social media.
The PFF NC had claimed that it not have full-time roles but will induct coaches into a ‘panel’; picking officials according to the assignment.
It hasn’t explained the reasoning behind that move but for the trials and the camp for the selected players for the women’s team, there were no other coaches involved apart from the selected ones.
The SAFF Women’s Cham­pionship, which kicks off in Nepal from Sept 6, will see the national women’s team take part in an international match for the first time in eight years.
Pakistan football has been mired in crisis and controversy for the major part of the last decade with an institutional crisis in the PFF seeing world’s football governing body FIFA appoint the NC to manage affairs of the federation. Pakistan has also been suspended twice by FIFA in the last five years.
“Players have come back with a lot of motivation, lot of drive ... there is a desire to win,” Rizki said in the video announcing the coaching panel. “We want to play with the ball, and have creative attacking style of play.”
The national team are scheduled to open their Group ‘A’ campaign at the SAFF Women’s Championship against defending champions India on Sept 7 but there are doubts whether their arch-rivals will be there in Nepal.
India was suspended by FIFA this week due to external influence in the running of the matters of the All India Football Federation.
The South Asian Football Federation decided at its executive committee meeting on Wednesday that it will monitor the situation in India until Aug 23 before revising the fixtures for the Women’s Championship.
Pakistan only came out of a 15-month suspension by FIFA at the end of June after the NC regained control of the PFF headquarters, which had been seized by a group of officials led by Ashfaq Hussain Shah which claimed the Haroon Malik-led committee wasn’t serious about holding elections.
Prior to the takeover of the PFF headquarters and the subsequent ban, Rizki had been in touch with NC chairman Haroon and had been promised a role in the national set up, according to well-placed sources.
The suspension prevented that but now the former Karachi United coach has been handed a role by the NC.
After his stint with Karachi United, Rizki — who holds a UEFA B license — founded the Karachi City FC club but it did not take part in last year’s National Women’s Championship which was disrupted after the takeover of the PFF headquarters. 
Walid, meanwhile, holds a UEFA C license and showed his acumen at the National Women’s Championship where he guided Highlanders to the semi-finals before the tournament was cancelled.

5,Liverpool’s problems dwarfed by United’s ahead of Old Trafford clash,"LONDON: With four points dropped in their opening two games, Liverpool’s margin for error in the expected title...","LONDON: With four points dropped in their opening two games, Liverpool’s margin for error in the expected title race with Manchester City already looks seriously depleted as they prepare for their clash with Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday.
Mediocre displays in draws against Fulham and Crystal Palace mean Juergen Klopp’s side are already in the bottom half of the table, and injuries and a three-game suspension for new signing Darwin Nunez add to the sense of unease at Anfield. 
Incredibly, Liverpool’s early-season problems look trivial compared with those of their arch-rivals Manchester United. 
For the first time since 1992, United are bottom of the Premier League after losing their opening two games against Brighton and Hove Albion and Brentford. 
Thirty years ago they recovered to win the title, but currently not even the most optimistic United fans will believe they can realistically challenge for the top four, let alone think of challenging reigning champions City. 
For a few hours early on Wednesday, United’s fans dared to dream that Tesla founder Elon Musk was planning to buy the club, only for the billionaire to admit later on that his Twitter message was just a joke. 
British chemicals magnate Jim Ratcliffe’s apparent interest in buying in to Manchester United offers some hope for United’s fans desperate for an end to the Glazer-family ownership. 
But for now, the only thing on their minds will be avoiding what could be humiliation at the hands of a Liverpool side desperate to get their own season up and running. 
United’s performance against Brentford last weekend, when they conceded four times in the opening 35 minutes, was one of the most humiliating in the club’s illustrious history. 
New manager Erik ten Hag looked crestfallen on the touchline and the Dutchman surely could not have imagined quite how big a challenge he faces to revive United’s fortunes. 
Including the end of last season, United have now lost four successive Premier League games, scoring once and conceding 11 times. 
Liverpool will be licking their lips, having beaten United 5-0 away and 4-0 at home last season. 
Ten Hag’s problems are so numerous his head will be spinning. Keeper David de Gea was a liability against Brentford, as were most of the defenders in front of him, while Cristiano Ronaldo gives the impression of wanting to be elsewhere. 
United clearly need several quality signings but have so far failed badly in the transfer market with the clock ticking. 
While it seems unlikely, victory would put United above Liverpool in the table and former Liverpool striker John Aldridge is wary of gloating about the problems up the road. 
“Everyone is laughing at the state of United at the moment with their team, behind-the-scenes drama and the state of their ground,” Aldridge told the Liverpool Echo. 
“This game will be like a cup final for them. They will not have much else to play for this season other than beating Liverpool and Man City due to being so far behind as a club. 
“If they win against us, they will go above us. That is a crazy situation to be in given how badly United are playing.” 
Before Monday’s clash, Manchester City and Arsenal will both be looking to maintain their perfect starts. 
City are at Newcastle United on Sunday, allowing Arsenal the chance to go top if they win at Bournemouth on Saturday. 
City’s transformation into the dominant club in English football over the past decade thanks to the flow of investment from Abu Dhabi appeared the blueprint for Newcastle to follow under the ownership of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund. 
But Newcastle’s first summer transfer window under the new regime has been surprisingly quiet with Nick Pope and Sven Botman the only new faces at St James’ Park. 
They have still enjoyed a strong start to the season with four points from their first two games, but City’s visit will give an early indication as to how seriously the Magpies could challenge for a top-four finish. 
Tottenham Hotspur, one of six teams on four points, begin the weekend programme on Saturday with a lunchtime kickoff against Wolverhampton Wanderers while Chelsea are at Leeds United on Sunday. 
Fixtures (all times GMT):  
Saturday: Tottenham Hotspur v Wolverhampton Wanderers (1130), Leicester City v Southampton, Crystal Palace v Aston Villa, Everton v Nottingham Forest, Fulham v Brentford (all 1400), Bournemouth v Arsenal (1630). 
Sunday: Leeds United v Chelsea, West Ham United v Brighton & Hove Albion (both 1300), Newcastle United v Manchester City (1530). Monday: Manchester United v Liverpool (1900).

6,Britain’s Bigham sets Hour world record,LONDON: Britain’s Dan Bigham smashed the Hour record when he completed a distance of 55.548 kilometres around the...,"LONDON: Britain’s Dan Bigham smashed the Hour record when he completed a distance of 55.548 kilometres around the Tissot Velodrome in Grenchen, Switzerland on Friday.
Bigham, an aerodynamics specialist and race engineer for British cycling team Ineos Grenadiers, paced himself to perfection on his prototype Pinarello track bike, going almost half a kilometre further than Belgium’s Victor Campenaerts in 2019 — a huge margin.
Campenaerts managed 55.089.
Five riders had tried and failed to beat the record since then, most rec­ently Alex Dowsett in November 2021.
Bigham collapsed to the track after his record-breaking ride before being congratulated by his family who were watching inside the empty velodrome.
“I was trying to ride 16-second laps for the second half and that’s a bit daunting as I’ve not done 16.0s for half an hour before,” Bigham said after recovering his breath.
“It’s a bit mind-blowing. The support I’ve had around me [from Ineos] was second to none and that made it a whole lot easier. Everything you would expect from the team.
“I knew I was on pace but you still have to complete the distance. I knew if I could get to 20 minutes to go and then push on a little bit.”
Former national champion Bigham, a team pursuit silver medallist for England at the Commonwealth Games, has forged a reputation as one of the best in the business in cycling aerodynamics having graduated in Motorsport Engineering from Oxford Brooks University.
Bigham, 30, owns cycling performance business Wattshop and joined the technical staff of Ineos Grenadiers in January.
Bigham said he had  “played it safe” in the final minutes to avoid any mishaps.
“I just focussed on line, breathing and head position,” he said.  “It was really enjoyable as I knew I had a safety net.
Bigham’s new record might soon come under attack, however, with Ineos’s world time trial champion Filippo Ganna confirming he will mount an assault on the Hour.

JEDDAH: British boxer Anthony Joshua weighed in more than 10 kilos (22 pounds) heavier than defending champion Oleksandr Usyk on Friday ahead of their world title rematch in Saudi Arabia.
Usyk weighed in at 100.5kg (221.6 pounds), barely changed from  before although still the heaviest of his career, while two-time heavyweight champion Joshua tipped the scales at 110.9kg (244.5 pounds) — four pounds more than when he lost the  titles last September in London. 
Usyk, 19-0 and the bookies’ favourite after his unanimous decision on Joshua’s home turf, confounded predictions that he had packed on several kilos of muscle to counter the towering Joshua.
“You see, your expectations are not always met,” the unbeaten champion  said unsmilingly when asked if he had been tricking everyone ahead of  the ‘Rage on the Red Sea’ clash. 
Joshua went first, keeping on his trousers and socks, before the  two big men stood face-to-face after the weigh-in, staring fixedly at  each other with Usyk looking up at his taller opponent. 
Asked what he had seen in Joshua’s eyes, the Ukrainian replied:  “Myself. It was the reflection of myself.”
Joshua, 32, shrugged off the pre-fight psychology when asked what went through his mind. 
“Not much. Just a face-off. For me personally face-offs don’t mean nothing. Face-offs don’t win fights,” he said. 
“All this stuff, weight, face-off, it doesn’t matter to me. It’s all about the fight,” Joshua said.  “I’m just ready for 12 rounds, 100 per cent. Anything shorter than that, it’s a bonus.” Many commentators have written off Joshua after a hesitant showing against the quick and skillful Usyk at London’s Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last September.
But the 6ft 6inches (1.98m) Watford man, who is striving to become a three-time world champion, has promised to be more  “competitive”.
Promoter Eddie Hearn has suggested Joshua will go for the knock-out.
British bookmaker William Hill has Usyk as the 4/7 favourite on  Saturday night, with 80% of customers backing the Ukrainian to win by  knockout or stoppage. Joshua was down as a 13/8 underdog, with a draw at  16/1. 
Saturday’s clash will be the 12th consecutive world title fight for Joshua, the 24-2 former Olympic gold-medallist whose other professional defeat was a shock TKO by Andy Ruiz Jr in June 2019.
Joshua avenged that loss six months later in the  “Clash of the Dunes” in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, the first heavyweight world title fight in the conservative kingdom.
On Saturday’s undercard, Somali-born Briton Ramla Ali will fight the Dominican Republic’s Crystal Garcia Nova in the first women’s professional boxing match in Saudi Arabia.

8,Medvedev advances while Swiatek sinks in Cincinnati,CINCINNATI: Top-ranked Daniil Medvedev advanced to the ATP and WTA Cincinnati Masters quarter-finals on Thursday...,"CINCINNATI: Top-ranked Daniil Medvedev advanced to the ATP and WTA Cincinnati Masters quarter-finals on Thursday while women’s world number one Iga Swiatek was upset by American Madison Keys. 
Top seed Medvedvev kept Denis Shapovalov winless against world number ones with a 7-5, 7-5 victory while Poland’s Swiatek lost 6-3, 6-4 to 2019 Cincinnati champion Keys, who needed five match points to finish off the shock triumph. 
Shapovalov, who lost in an hour and three-quarters, has dropped all eight career matches he has played against the elite echelon. 
Medvedev moved into a quarter-final against 11th seed Taylor Fritz after the American stopped number six seed Andrey Rublev 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 7-5. 
“It was a fight today, definitely not easy,” said Medvedev, who clinched the top US Open seeding when Rafael Nadal lost here in the second round. “In general, I managed to be pretty constant. I got a lot of break opportunities. Broke first in the first set. Served pretty well even in the game where I lost my serve. In general, happy with my level and looking forward to the next matches.”  
Borna Coric, who upset second seed Nadal, continued his injury comeback progress by beating Roberto Bautista Agut 6-2, 6-3. Number 152 Coric is the lowest-ranked ATP Masters 1000 quarter-finalist since 239th-ranked Ivo Karlovic at 2011 Indian Wells. 
A quarter-finalist at Flushing Meadows in 2020, Coric will next face Canadian seventh seed Felix Auger-Aliassime, who saved two match points in the second set in a stunning 2-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-1 comeback victory over Italian Jannick Sinner. 
Third seed Carlos Alcaraz, a quarter-finalist at Flushing Meadows last year, beat former US Open champion Marin Cilic 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 to set up a meeting with British world number 11 Cameron Norrie, who downed American Ben Shelton 6-0, 6-2. 
Greek fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, semi-finalist at the last two editions, defeated Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-3 in a little over 90 minutes after the Argentine served up nine double faults. 
Tsitsipas will next face John Isner, who sent down 20 aces in a 7-6 (7-3), 1-6, 7-6 (7-4) defeat of US compatriot Sebastian Korda. At 37, Isner is the oldest Cincinnati men’s quarter-finalist in the post-1968 Open Era. 
Unseeded Keys accounted for Swiatek to take her place in the quarter-finals and register her first win over a reigning world number one. 
Swiatek never found an ace and was broken five times as she fought back in vain after standing one game from defeat. 
It was the second week in a row that the Pole, who put together a 37-match win streak this season, lost in a Masters third round. She suffered the same fate in Toronto seven days earlier. 
Keys will next face Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, who beat Alison Riske-Amritraj 6-2, 6-4 to sail into the quarter-finals.
Also ousted was Estonian second seed Anett Kontaveit, who fell to China’s Zhang Shuai 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. 
Last year’s US Open semi-finalist Aryna Sabalenka defeated Shelby Rogers 6-4, 6-7 (2-7), 6-4, sealing victory with a backhand winner down the line, and faces Zhang in the next round. 
American Jessica Pegula ended the run of US Open champion Emma Raducanu 7-5, 6-4, sending the Briton onto the practice courts before the August 29 start of her Grand Slam title defence. 
Raducanu, who had beaten former Grand Slam champions Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka in the previous two rounds, will head to New York with a 15-18 record since her 2021 title triumph and will drop from the top-10 after failing to reach the quarter-finals. 
Czech Petra Kvitova, twice a Wimbledon champion, defeated Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur 6-1, 4-6, 6-0. Kvitova broke six times as her fifth-ranked Tunisian opponent committed six double-faults. 
She next faces Australian Ajla Tomljanovic, who staged a stunning comeback to beat Russian Veronika Kudermetova 3-6, 7-6 (4-7), 6-3 and reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final.

“Casemiro wants a new challenge and we understand his feeling, I do not think there is a way back,” Ancelotti told a news conference on Friday.
“I have spoken with him. Casemiro, for what he has done and the person he is, we must respect that desire. The negotiations are ongoing right now, it is not official yet, he is still our player but his will is to leave.”  Reuters understands that the 30-year-old midfielder is to sign a four to five year deal at United with wages of around 16 million euros ($16.10 million) per year.
United’s first offer to Real Madrid for the Brazilian is around 70 million euros, British media reports said.
“Real Madrid loses a player that has linked really well with the other midfielders with more quality, (Luka) Modric and (Toni) Kroos. He is important and has been key to Madrid’s success,” Ancelotti said. “If there is agreement, we will wish him the best and look at what we have in the club to replace him.”  The La Liga and European champions signed France midfielder Aurelien Tchouameni in June from AS Monaco with the 22-year-old believed to be a replacement for Casemiro.
“We have Tchouameni but other players that can play in the same position, too,” Ancelotti said.
“Tchouameni was one of the best midfielders on the market. Kroos can also play there, like he did in my second year here.”  After joining the Spanish giants in 2013 from Sao Paulo, Casemiro won five Champions League trophies, three La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey, and three Club World Cups among other honours.

Chahar has been a familiar face in the 20-overs squad, shouldering new ball duties and providing late cameos with the bat. But he was sidelined for six months after suffering a quadriceps tear in February and then hurting his back. 
There was no rustiness on his return as he claimed 3-27, dismissing Zimbabwe’s top three batsmen to set up India’s 10-wicket win in Harare. 
Chahar said he was not preoccupied with his selection for the World Cup in Australia in October-November. 
“That is not in my hand,” he said after collecting the man-of-the-match award. “Skill-wise, though, I have worked really hard. There I can say I have probably started where I had left off. After the first over, rest whatever I bowled, I was happy. It was a seven-over spell, so the fitness is good.” 
While Jasprit Bumrah remains India’s automatic choice across formats, the emergence of fellow seamers Harshal Patel and Arshdeep Singh complicates Chahar’s return to the 20-overs squad ahead of the World Cup.

11,Indian women footballers face uncertain future after FIFA ban,NEW DELHI: India’s women footballers are in despair and uncertain about the future after a FIFA ban saw the ...,"NEW DELHI: India’s women footballers are in despair and uncertain about the future after a FIFA ban saw the country stripped of a major international tournament and left its best team in limbo.
The sport’s world governing body this week suspended the national federation  “due to undue influence from third parties” — member associations must be free from legal and political interference.
The All India Football Federation has been plagued by governance issues.
The indefinite suspension had an immediate impact on Indian football, men and women, from professional down to grassroots.
The under-17 Women’s World Cup, set to begin in India on October 11, will not currently take place as planned. It was supposed to be a first FIFA tournament in the country since 2017.
The punishment also coincided with the Asian Football Confederation Women’s Club Championship in Uzbekistan, where Indian league winners Gokulam Kerala FC were chasing a maiden title.
They only learned about the FIFA suspension when their flight landed in Tashkent and have been barred from competing.
“We have put in so much hard work for the last two months and all the players were preparing to win the AFC trophy as well,” club captain Ashalati Devi, also skipper of the national women’s team, told India News.
“It remains our dream to lift the title,” said Devi, describing the team as  “distressed by all this”.
Gokulam put out a statement lamenting that it had been stopped from playing through  “no fault of ours”.
“Our women’s team is the pride and jewel for all [of] us and these players have proved themselves to be the best in India,” it said.
Lavanya Verma, who was short-listed for the U17 World Cup squad, pointed the finger at the AIFF.
“The main reason for the ban is due to poor governance, but us innocent players have to suffer,” the 17-year-old said.
“It is sad to see that the players are working so hard and this is what they get. I still hope the World Cup happens in India, but if it doesn’t, it will be a huge blow to everybody.”
India’s women footballers have defied scant investment to make inroads, but they have gained only muted recognition in a country better known for its frenzied obsession with cricket.
The national team are ranked 58th in the women’s global rankings — the men are 104th — and Gokulam last year became the first Indian women’s team to qualify for the an AFC club competition.
National referee Rachana Kamani said the FIFA suspension would throw the sport’s bright future in the country into jeopardy and make it less appealing for budding talent.
“In the last few years we have seen a rise in women’s football, but the rise could come only if we see top football being played on a constant basis,” the 23-year-old said.
“With the ban, the activities might reduce and the willingness to play in women might reduce because they will not see a future in the game.”
The AIFF’s troubles saw former chief Praful Patel remain in office beyond his term without fresh elections.
