0,"Stocks extend losses on lack of triggers, profit-taking",The refinery sector remained in the limelight even though main-board volumes were dull.,"KARACHI: The stock market came under pressure on Friday as investors resorted to profit-taking.
Arif Habib Ltd said market activity remained dull in the first few hours of trading owing to the absence of triggers. In the later part of the trading session, however, across-the-board profit-taking pushed down share prices and the index closed in the red zone. The refinery sector remained in the limelight even though main-board volumes were dull.
Weekly inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Index rose to 42.3 per cent for the week that ended on August 18. The latest inflation figure put a dampener on investors’ sentiments as they worry about the expec­ted increase in the benchmark interest rate in the next monetary policy anno­uncement due on Aug 22.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 43,270.65 points, down 210.85 points or 0.48pc from a day ago.



 
The trading volume decreased 50.7pc to 306.2 million shares while the traded value went down 39.1pc to $29.8m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Hascol Petroleum Ltd (71.46m shares), Pakistan Refinery Ltd (19.45m shares), Bank of Punjab Ltd (19.14m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd (18.38m shares) and WorldCall Telecom Ltd (17.8m shares).
Sectors contributing to the index performance included banking (-81.6 points), cement (-56.4 points), power (-33.3 points), tobacco (-11.2 points) and exploration and production (-10.3 points).
Companies registering the biggest increase in their share prices in absolute terms were Siemens Pakistan Engineering Ltd (Rs45), Shield Corporation Ltd (Rs21.14), Gatron Industries Ltd (Rs18.65), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs13.90) and Dynea Pakistan Ltd (Rs11.48).

1,Govt okays major changes to LNG policy,"Ban on import of over 860 products, tariff lines lifted.","ISLAMABAD: Ahead of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to Doha next week, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Friday approved major changes to the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Policy to remove restrictions on upcoming private sector LNG terminals to provide their part capacity to the government.
The meeting of the ECC, presided over by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, also formally approved the lifting of an import ban on all the 33 categories of goods covering more than 860 products and tariff lines.
Earlier on July 28, the ECC had approved the lifting of the ban on all but three categories—finished units of cars, cell phones, and home appliances. However, PM Sharif did not agree with the move, and hence the cabinet did not endorse the ECC decision.

Ban on import of over 860 products, tariff lines lifted

However, on the demand of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ahead of its board meeting on a bailout to Pakistan, the finance minister announced on Thursday the ban to be removed on all products. “Owing to serious concerns raised by trading partners on the imposition of the ban and considering the fact that the ban has impacted supply chains and domestic retail industry, the ECC decided that ban may be lifted on all the items. Further, the ECC recommended release of those held-up consignments arrived after June 30 up to July 31, 2022 with payment of surcharge,” an announcement said.
The ECC approved major changes to the LNG Policy 2011 under which it removed a key sticking point of the upcoming private sector LNG terminals on merchant model to facilitate Qatar’s investment in Pakistan’s LNG supply chain including terminals and LNG supplies ahead of Prime Minister’s visit to Doha next week.
In doing so, it also allowed all LNG terminals, including those already operational, to utilise their spare capacity that is not contracted by the government. As a result, existing gas pipeline capacity for new terminals may be limited.
The ECC decided to replace Article 6.2(a) of the LNG Policy, 2011 with amendments that provide Third-Party-Access (TPA) to new LNG terminals and associated facilities developed by the private sector without any government guarantees or off-take commitments on an optional basis on negotiated tariff with first right of use for terminal developers, operators, and their associated undertakings. This optional TPA will be for a period of 20 years only, from the date of commencement of construction, and thereafter, every terminal will be subject to mandatory TPA, whether it is regulated TPA or negotiated TPA, following the principle of use-it-or-lose-it (UIOLI).
Furthermore, terminal developers, operators, and associated undertakings will submit relevant information to the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) for information and market monitoring, including capacity utilisation and terminal tariff (only in the case of TPA). 
The TPA for the un-used capacity of LNG terminals contracted by public sector entities will be mandatory and regulated by Ogra.

2,CarFirst shuts down operations in Pakistan,Used-vehicle startup raised $89m in two funding rounds; VavaCars also shut down operations earlier this year.,"KARACHI: CarFirst, a startup that dealt in used vehicles, announced on Friday it was shutting down operations in Pakistan.
In a post on its LinkedIn page, the automobile marketplace thanked its stakeholders and said a team would remain in place to handle the “closing of the entity”.
CarFirst bought used cars and sold them onwards at a profit while promising its customers a “secure, convenient and hassle-free process”. It operated through a mobile app as well as a brick-and-mortar network of 35-plus purchase-and-sale centres in Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Multan and Hyderabad.
According to Crunchbase, a prospecting platform for dealmakers, CarFirst raised a total of $89 million in funding in two rounds. Their latest funding was raised on May 31, 2018 from a Series A round.

Used-vehicle startup raised $89m in two funding rounds; VavaCars also shut down operations earlier this year

The startup was funded by Frontier Car Group, a German entity that develops, launches and operates used-automotive marketplaces within emerging market economies. Its other ventures include Bayut-Dubizzle in the United Arab Emirates, Zameen in Pakistan, OLX in both Pakistan and Egypt, Lamudi in Indonesia, Philippines and Mexico, Mubawab in North Africa, and Kaidee in Thailand.
Earlier in June, a similar startup, VavaCars of Turkish origin, shut down its operations in Pakistan. Its closure followed layoffs, service rollbacks and outright closures by many other prominent ecommerce players in recent months. Backed by the Dutch energy giant Vitol, VavaCars had raised as much as $50 million in a Series B round in October 2021.
Pakistan’s startup ecosystem is in the midst of a tumultuous period. Global investors that generously injected cash in startups with fancy pitch decks have now started demanding early break-evens instead of mere top-line growth.
Prominent players like Airlift, Careem, Swvl and Truck It In have laid off employees and curtailed the scope of their operations recently in view of the global recession and unfavourable economic conditions on the local front.
CarFirst’s LinkedIn page showed the company had at least 366 employees with LinkedIn profiles. There was no word on the employees’ compensation in the wake of the company’s sudden closure. Company co-founder and CEO Raja Murad Khan didn’t respond to a request for comment on the reasons for the operational shutdown of CarFirst.

3,Korean auto makers resist slashing prices,Kia says it had created a precedent by setting a benchmark for other assemblers in terms of price setting.,"KARACHI: Korean auto assemblers in Pakistan appear hesitant to pass on the benefits of the rupee’s appreciation against the dollar, claiming that their price hikes were already lower than the ones delivered by Japanese automakers.
The assembler of Kia vehicles in Pakistan informed customers the company had raised the price by only 14 per cent in July, as compared to the 19-23pc jump made by three leading Japanese assemblers amid rupee’s depreciation against the dollar.
However, after a more than 11pc recovery in the rupee against the dollar since July, the three major players reduced prices by 6pc to 9pc earlier this week. The overall industry players’ price hike is still 15pc higher compared to the 14pc raise in Kia vehicles, the Korean assembler claimed.
Kia said the main industry players had corrected the prices to bring the increase to parity with its vehicles. The company further said that it had created a precedent by setting a benchmark for other assemblers in terms of price setting.
Speaking to Dawn, dealers of other Korean auto assemblers said there were no indications of any price cuts so far. “Chances of a price cut appear quite bleak as our prices are already lower than Japanese assemblers who have slashed prices,” they added.
A car assembler said pressure was building up on the Korean assemblers to pass on the relief of the rupee hike to the buyers.
So far, the price cut by the Japanese assemblers has not been on a par with the massive rate hikes witnessed earlier in one go.
Pak Suzuki increased the prices by Rs314,000-661,000 but slashed prices by Rs75,000-199,000. Indus Motor Company (IMC) raised the prices by Rs760,000 to Rs3.16 million but has now announced reduced them by Rs260,000 to Rs1.14m. Honda Atlas Cars Limited made a price jump of Rs785,000 to Rs1.45m but a price relief of Rs280,000-550,000 was given to buyers.
Meanwhile, some Chinese assemblers have come out with price reduction from Aug 19. For example, the assembler of DSFK vehicles had decreased the prices by Rs80,000-495,000. Glory 580 Pro, 1.5CVT, and 1.8 CVT now cost Rs6.1m, Rs5.61m, and Rs5.806m, respectively, compared to Rs6.55m, Rs6.105m, and Rs6.256m previously.
The new KO7 Humsafar and Pearl MT rates are Rs2.469m and Rs1.749m, respectively, versus Rs2.549m and Rs1.920m. Master Changan Motors had reduced the prices by Rs50,000-400,000 after raising the prices by Rs400,000 to Rs1.139m.
Oshan X7 Comfort and FutureSense are now priced at Rs7.049m and Rs7.549m, while Alsvin Comfort MT, DCT and Lumiere models carry new rates of Rs3.394m, Rs3.649m and Rs3.844m. The new price tags for the Karavan MPV, Plus MPV, and Sherpa M9 are Rs2.419m, Rs2.569m, and Rs2.134m.

4,Export strategy for 10 priority sectors unveiled,It is part of the Strategic Trade Policy Framework 2020-25 approved in November last year.,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Commerce on Friday unveiled the National Priority Sectors Export Strategy (NPSES), with a focus on 10 priority sectors to achieve growth in exports.
The strategy is part of the Strategic Trade Policy Framework 2020-25, approved in November last year and identified 18 priority sectors with guidelines to develop sector-specific policy measures to promote their exports.
The NPSES focuses on 10 of the 18 STPF priority sectors, including engineering goods, leather, processed food and beverages, fruits and vegetables, meat and poultry, pharmaceuticals, software development and services, business process outsourcing, logistics and institutional coordination.
The individual export policies are developed through the guidance of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) and in close collaboration with industry leaders. The NPSES aims to enable and sustain a new cycle of export growth for Pakistan, exploiting its vast untapped potential for trade and investment development.
According to the documents, the NPSES is geared towards strengthening the competitiveness of both emerging and established export sectors. It lays out a prioritised five-year action-oriented framework and acknowledges that things need to be done differently to increase trade’s contribution to economic development.
The policy will improve the business environment for all Pakistani enterprises. It will create the conditions for diversification by strengthening emerging sectors. Without logistics and institutional alignment, these ambitions will only stay on paper, so these areas have been brought to the highest level of priority as key enablers for sector growth.
The International Trade Centre (ITC) is working with the government of Pakistan with financial support from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of the UK government, through the Revenue Mobilisation, Investment and Trade Programme (ReMIT) to support the development of the NPSES.
Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar said that government has taken a series of initiatives to promote exports to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth, poverty reduction and improvement in the living standard of the people. “We will work with all stakeholders to use the opportunities that the NPSES provides in creating jobs and new opportunities for Pakistan,” he said.
British Acting High Commissioner Andrew Dalgleish said the FCDO was proud to support programmes like the ReMIT that focused on supporting Pakistan to strengthen institutional capacity for trade policy formulation and address trade barriers.
ITC Chief Trade Facilitation and Policy for Business Dr Mohammad Saeed said that driven by quality and innovation, the strategy and attendant work plan would strengthen the international presence of Pakistani products from the priority sectors.

In  an announcement, Nepra said it had imposed the penalty while taking  cognisance of the ‘massive power breakdown which plunged the whole country  into darkness’ on Jan 9, 2021, because of the negligence of management of the Guddu Power Plant and took about 20 hours in restoring the system.

Moreover, an opportunity for a hearing was also  given to the management of CPGCL on May 17, 2022, who failed to provide  any satisfactory response, the regulator said.
Hence, the  regulator held the company guilty of violating relevant provisions of  the applicable documents and imposed a Rs50m fine.

7,Pakistan ‘over-financed’: SBP acting governor,"Says extreme pressures on Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, currency and current account are temporary in nature.","KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Acting Governor Dr Murtaza Syed on Friday said that Pakistan is “over-financed,” thanks to the recently secured $4 billion of additional financing commitments from friendly countries.
In a meeting with the top management of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Dr Syed said the International Monetary Fund programme has ensured that the country’s financing needs will be fully met over the next 12 months. “This will provide an additional boost to Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves in 2022-23,” said a press release by the PSX.
Dr Syed emphasised that extreme pressures on Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves, currency and current account are temporary in nature. “The rupee came under significant pressure during June and July, primarily due to a stronger dollar worldwide, a deterioration in the current account deficit and domestic political uncertainty,” he said.
The acting governor said imports were expected to decline in the coming months owing to some ease in global commodity prices as well as domestic demand moderation due to policy initiatives.

However, the dollar was up by Re1 to Rs219 in the open market,  highlighting the stark gap in greenback prices between the two markets.
Currency dealers said the current exchange rate is almost at the same  level throughout this week, which is good for the local currency as it  appreciated most of the time during the ongoing fiscal year.
The State Bank of Pakistan and the government are trying to stop the  outflow of dollars from the country — first by reducing the import bill,  and secondly, by cracking down on dolalr smuggling from the  country, mostly towards Afghanistan.
