• PTI blames home minister for ‘botched’ operation
• PML-N terms move ‘attempt to please Imran Khan’, questions issuance of arrest warrants
LAHORE: The Punjab police raided the residences of at least a dozen Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) MPAs in several cities of Punjab after warrants were issued for their arrest for their alleged involvement in the violence witnessed in the Punjab Assembly during the chief minister’s election on April 16.
The warrants were issued after Qilla Gujjar Singh police approached a local court in Lahore seeking the arrest of the lawmakers for their failure to join the investigation, despite the issuance of several summons. 
However, the lawmakers managed to evade police and flee to Islamabad, where the PML-N is at the helm of affairs.
The raids on the PML-N leaders’ homes were ordered by the ruling coalition in Punjab, which consists of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-Q).
Police teams were dispatched to the homes of PML-N lawmakers in Lahore, Gujranwala, Naro­wal, Rawalpindi, Sheikhu­pura, and Sahiwal.
PTI leaders blamed the “poor strategy” of Punjab Home Minister Hashim Dogar for this botched operation to arrest the PML-N MPAs involved in alleged hooliganism on April 16 during the chief minister’s election in the Punjab Assembly.
“Mr Dogar has been forewarning the PML-N men about their arrest in the PA attack case by making public announcements for quite some time. Did he consider these lawmakers a fool to stay in Punjab after his threats?” a PTI leader quipped.
In contrast, the Shehbaz Sharif administration in the centre quietly conducted the ‘Shehbaz Gill operation’, the PTI leader told Dawn. “How could any of the nominated PML-N MPA be arrested today when the possibility of action against them was announced over a week ago?” he asked.
Punjab IGP Faisal Shahkar did not respond to Dawn’s query regarding police raids to arrest the PML-N MPAs. 
‘Performance to please Imran’
The PML-N, however, provided footage to the media pertaining to the raids. The party’s information secretary in Punjab, MPA Azma Bokhari, termed these raids the “over-performance of Hashim Dogar to please” PTI chief Imran Khan. 
“Punjab police raided the residences of 12 PML-N MPAs in the province but failed to arrest any of them. They have probably gone to Islamabad,” Ms Bokhari said as she questioned the issuance of the arrest warrants against the party lawmakers.
“PTI lawmakers attacked the deputy speaker [on April 16] and indulged in hooliganism on the day of the chief minister’s election; we even have the CCTV footage to support our claim. The FIRs should be registered against the PTI lawmakers instead of the PML-N MPAs,” she alleged in a comment to Dawn. She said all nominated lawmakers would seek protective bail in the wake of the issuance of warrants for their arrests.
The ‘wanted’ PML-N MPAs include former Punjab home minister Attaullah Tarar, his brother Bilal Tarar, the party’s Punjab Secretary General Sardar Awais Leghari, Rana Mashhood, Maryam Nawaz’s close aide Saiful Malook Khokhar, Mirza Javed, Abdur Rauf, Pir Ashraf Rasool, Pir Khizar Hayat Khagga, Raja Sagheer Ahmad, Bilal Farooq, and Rana Manan.
Warrants issued
Qilla Gujjar Singh police filed an application with the magistrate at Cantonment Courts pleading that the suspects had not joined the investigation despite summons issued to them. Subsequently, the magistrate issued warrants for their arrest, prompting provincewide raids.
PML-N leader Attaullah Tarar, who was the home minister during the three-month stint of the PML-N government in Punjab, had spearheaded the registration of cases against the PTI and PML-Q lawmakers for their alleged involvement in hooliganism in the Punjab Assembly.
However, July 17 by-polls turned the tables in Punjab as, after its thumping victory, the PTI nominee Parvez Elahi managed to replace Hamza Shehbaz as the chief minister of the province. Now, the PTI-PML-Q used the same episode of violence to hunt the PML-N men.
Earlier this week, sensing a police action, PML-N’s Tarar exited Punjab to enter the federal capital along with some other PML-N stalwarts. Although he secured a protective bail from the Islamabad High Court (IHC), he did not return to Punjab to join the police investigation in the said case.
While reacting to these warrants, the former Punjab home minister recorded his protest. “The arrest warrants seem to be a reward from Chaudhry Parvez Elahi in return for our elders’ favours to him. We will face this political victimization as this is a frivolous case,” Mr Tarar said in a tweet.

 





 
It may be noted that ousted premier Imran Khan had directed Mr Dogar to go after the ones involved in the May 25 violence against the PTI activists, but the provincial government has yet to initiate any action against the previous administration in this regard.
The PTI leadership says ‘brutal action’ against its party leaders and protesters during the May 25 ‘peaceful’ long march on Islamabad was unleashed by Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and PM Shehbaz Sharif’s son Hamza Shehbaz, who was the chief minister of the province at the time. Hamza Shehbaz is in London for an “indefinite period”. The PML-N said he had gone there to see his three-year-old daughter who has cardiac issues. About Mr Sanaullah, the PTI is insistent that the interior minister will pay for his role in the May 25 crackdown on PTI supporters.

1,"Imran alleges Gill ‘abused’, urges PTI to take to streets",Says section 144 is in force in capital; Fawad Chaudhry says rally will proceed as planned.,"• Islamabad admin denies PTI permission to hold rally, says Section 144 in place
• Court refuses remand, sends Gill to Pims in view of his condition
ISLAMABAD: After a court in the capital declined to hand over his custody to Islamabad police in view of his fragile condition, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan on Friday alleged that his close aide Shahbaz Gill was “sexually abused” and “tortured both mentally and physically” by investigators during the ongoing probe against him for making “seditious remarks”.
Mr Khan also announced countrywide rallies to express solidarity with his chief of staff, who is incarcerated in a sedition case, vowing to seek justice for the PTI leader currently being treated in the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims). The capital police said they did not inflict torture on Shahbaz Gill so who were the individuals responsible for the torture of Mr Gill, the PTI chief asked.
“There is a general perception in the public at large and in our minds too, as to who could have carried out the gruesome torture. Remember, the public will react. We will leave no stone unturned to find those responsible and bring them to justice,” Mr Khan said in his tweet.
“All the pictures and videos show clearly Gill was tortured both mentally and physically, including sexual abuse – most too gruesome to relate. He was humiliated to break him down. I now have full detailed information,” the former premier tweeted.

 





 
Mr Khan urged his party supporters to take to the streets today in the federal capital and all regional headquarters to protest against the detention and alleged torture inflicted on Mr Gill. The PTI chairman urged people to join the rally to show their resolve against the torture.
Rally in Islamabad
Meanwhile, in a video clip shared on the party’s official Twitter account, Fawad Chaudhry said that the PTI “strongly condemned worst kind of torture” on Mr Gill. He added the PTI would hold a rally at Jinnah Avenue from China Chowk to F-9 Park in the federal capital and in all regional headquarters.

 





 
Mr Chaudhry said Imran Khan will lead the rally in Islamabad and will address the party workers at the park which will be shown at all regional headquarters through a video link. The PTI leader further claimed that the party has acquired pictures and doctors’ certificates to corroborate their claims and they have been forwarded to the authorities concerned.
Earlier, PTI leaders Babar Awan and Shahzad Wasim also held a joint press conference where they alleged that that Mr Gill was sexually abused and tortured.
However, the Islamabad administration said the PTI will not be allowed to hold a rally in the federal capital and added that Section 144 was in force in the city. The PTI, however, refused to comply with the directives and Fawad Chaudhry said the rally will proceed as planned.
On the other hand, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said in a statement PTI chairman Imran Khan has to get a court order if he wanted to meet Shahbaz Gill in custody. Her statement came after Mr Khan went to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) Hospital to meet Gill but he was denied. “He is not a monarch to go anywhere he wants,” she added.
Court hearing
When Judicial Magistrate Raja Farrukh Ali Khan took up a police application seeking Mr Gill’s eight-day physical remand, the PTI legal team opposed any further extension of the remand.
The counsel for Mr Gill argued that the instant case was registered without the prior permission of the federal government.
The defence counsel argued that Gill was “subjected to fierce physical and mental torture” and they placed on record an application for registration of first information report (FIR) against the delinquents and alleged torturers.
The counsel also expressed doubt on the medical board report, saying it deliberately did not place the report regarding the state of the accused lungs before the court.
The report, issued late on Thursday night, said Mr Gill was discharged as he was clinically stable, and advised him some medication.
The judge observed that “under the attending circumstances of the case in hand, I am inclined to hand over the custody of the accused to police for 48 hours today. The accused be sent back to Pims Hospital for thorough investigation regarding asthma and respiratory disease.”

2,"ECP contempt notices to Imran, Asad and Fawad",ISLAMABAD: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan on Friday issued contempt notices to PTI chairman Imran Khan and ...,"ISLAMABAD: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan on Friday issued contempt notices to PTI chairman Imran Khan and two other central leaders Asad Umer and Fawad Chaudhry for using ‘intemperate’ langu­age against the chief election commissioner and the ECP.  
They have been asked to appear in person or through their counsel before the commission on August 30 to explain their position. The ECP has attached excerpts of the contemptuous remarks with dates and events in the notices. In one of the two notices issued to Imran Khan, it has been pointed out that on July 18 in a public address he criticised the commission for its decision to hold re-election in Daska and “getting his party defeated”.  
In the same address, he had also accused the ECP of ignoring the use of police by the PPP to win local government elections in Sindh and targeted the ECP member from Sindh, saying he was drawing salary from the Sindh government and the commission simultaneously.  
On July 21, Imran Khan talked about the recent by-polls in 20 provincial assembly constituencies of Punjab and said these polls besides the political parties had also been contested against the ECP and administration. He had alleged that the ECP used all tactics to get the PTI defeated. “ECP should be punished for the role they played in these elections,” he remarked.  
On July 27, he said “the most shameful role had been played by the ECP, which tried to defeat us in league with PML-N and Hamza”.  
“The... accusations have also been reported by the leading print and electronic media. On account of your... derogatory and contemptuous remarks and acts, you have willfully and intentionally scandalised, ridiculed, and maligned this commission and the members of the commission in order to bring the commission and its members into hatred in eyes of general public, which otherwise is an attempt to prejudice, the process of forthcoming election which constitute a clear contempt of this commission.  
In another notice to Mt Khan, the commission said he used “insulting and indecent language” against Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja in his rallies on July 12, 18, 21 and 27, and August 4 and 8.  
In the notice to PTI secretary general Asad Umar for using intemperate, un-parliamentary language and contemptuous remarks against the Election Commission and the CEC, reference has been made to the related Pemra record on his news conferences on July 27, August 2 and 4 and August 10, aired by the media.  
The remarks made on July 27, 2022 have been re-produced in the notice: “…the ECP has become extremely partial and become a party. In Pakistan’s politics, it is no more an impartial institution. Look at their three decisions made within the last week.” His remarks on August 2 when the commission had announced its judgement in the PTI foreign funding case: “In my view, if anyone had any doubt that the Election Commission has become partial. It is a political rival. Similarly, record has been obtained from Pemra regarding remarks made by PTI senior vice president Fawad Chaudhry during his news conferences on May 11, July 19 and July 20 this year. His remarks on May 11: “Imran Khan and PTI have no faith in the ECP and chief election commissioner. Imran said in a public meeting that the chief election commissioner should take a post in N-League and since the largest party has no faith in him, there was only one honourable way for him to resign.”  
His remarks on July 19:…very few days are left for CEC to himself decide on bowing out or action will be initiated for this purpose…whatever little respect he enjoys…he has tried his utmost that none respects him.”  
Fawad made these remarks on July 20: “there is such CEC sitting in the Election Commission, who has no shame or dignity, who with a planning sale and purchase during Senate (polls).”  
The PTI leader has also been asked to appear before the commission on August 30 personally or through his counsel, along with a written reply to explain his position at 10am.

3,Weekly inflation races to all-time high of 42.3pc,"ISLAMABAD: Inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) rose sharply in the week that ended on Aug 18,...","ISLAMABAD: Inflation measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) rose sharply in the week that ended on Aug 18, climbing to a record 42.3 per cent year-on-year, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data showed on Friday.
Before this, the highest ever year-on-year increase in the SPI was 38.63pc, recorded for the week ending on Aug 5.
The latest data shows that the SPI rose by 3.35pc over last week, mainly because of higher food prices. The highest week-on-week increase in inflation was recorded at 3.68pc for the week that ended on July 28.
Soaring vegetable prices due to damage to standing crops and a massive hike in power rates have also contributed to higher prices.
The government has already ann­ounced in the budget that it would revive sales tax on petroleum products as well as impose a petroleum development levy in phases. As a result, petrol and diesel prices are expected to increase for the next quarter. 
The government projected a modest inflationary annual target of 11.5pc for the ongoing fiscal year. However, the Federal Board of Revenue, which uses inflation as one of the measures to gather additional tax from consumers, has projected inflation at 12.8pc. Independent economists estimate inflation to remain around 25pc to 30pc.
The SPI monitors the pri­ces of 51 essential items ba­sed on a survey of 50 markets in 17 cities of the country.
During the week under rev­iew, the prices of 25 out of 51 items increased, 11 dec­r­eased and 15 remained stable.
The highest week-on-week incr­ease was noted in the prices of tomatoes 20.3pc, chicken 7.6pc, onions 2.3pc, powdered milk 2pc, eggs 1.6pc, pulse moong 1.4pc, and potatoes 1.07pc. As for non-food items, the price of electricity jumped 6.8pc, petrol 3pc and cigarettes 1.7pc.
In contrast, the items whose prices saw the highest week-on-week decrease were LPG 3.5pc, vegetable ghee 1.2pc, garlic 0.9pc, mustard oil 0.7pc, and pulse masoor 0.4pc.
On a year-on-year basis, the items whose prices jumped the most included pulse masoor 111pc, diesel 108.8pc, petrol 96pc, onions 94pc, five-litre cooking oil pack 72.9pc, mustard oil 71pc, chicken 69pc, ikg vegetable ghee packet 68.6pc, 2.5kg vegetable ghee 67pc, electricity 63pc, washing soap 61.9pc, pulse gram 58.9pc, gents sponge chappal 52.2pc, pulse mash 51.5pc and garlic 36.6pc.
The SPI increased by 1.8pc for the lowest income group (i.e. people earning below Rs17,732 per month) and by 3.94pc for the group with a monthly income above Rs44,175.

4,Jameel Ahmad appointed SBP governor for five years,One of his first tasks is to chair a monetary policy meeting to consider interest rate...,"KARACHI: The federal government has appointed Jameel Ahmad, a deputy governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), as the bank’s governor for a five-year term, the finance ministry said on Friday.
He has been appointed “with the approval of the president of Pakistan, upon the recommendation of the federal government, with immediate effect”, the ministry’s notification said.
The central bank had been without a full-time governor since May and one of Mr Ahmad’s first tasks will be to chair a monetary policy meeting to consider its policy rate.
“Congratulations and welcome back Jameel sahib,” Finance Minis­ter Miftah Ismail said in a tweet after Mr Ahmad’s appointment.

One of his first tasks is to chair a monetary policy meeting to consider interest rate

The three-year term of Mr Ahmad’s predecessor, Dr Reza Baqir, expired on May 4, after which Dr Murtaza Syed took over as acting governor.
Mr Ahmad was reappointed as the central bank’s deputy governor three years ago after having served in the role from April 2017 to Oct­ober 2018, according to his profile on the SBP’s website.
As a deputy SBP governor, Mr Ahmad played an instrumental role in digitising banking and payments and enabling financial technology services, the central bank said.
Mr Ahmad’s career spans more than 30 years in various positions at the SBP and the Saudi Central Bank. His association with the SBP dates back to 1991 in various capacities, including deputy governor and executive director.
Before his appointment as an SBP deputy governor, he was executive director of its Banking Supervision and Financial Stability Group.
He has also served as group head of operations of the banking policy and regulations department, the development finance and financial resource management department.
He joined the Saudi central bank in July 2009 as an adviser, a position he held until April 2015. He has contributed significantly to formulating the policy and regulatory framework for the banking systems of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and monitoring their financial soundness and stability, according to the central bank’s website.
Mr Ahmad supervised the formulation and issuance of regulations for electronic money institutions in Pakistan. He also served as the chairman of steering committees on implementing Raast, an instant payments system; digital banking regulations; and SBP’s Knowledge Management System.
He also oversaw the development and issuance of Pakistan’s national payment systems strategy developed jointly by SBP and the World Bank.
Mr Ahmad completed his MBA from the University of Punjab in 1988 and has been a fellow member of the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan since 1994, the Institute of Bankers Pakistan since 1993 and the Institute of Corporate Secretaries of Pakistan since 1992.

5,Telcos fear upcoming spectrum auction will be another ‘one-horse race’,Most players feel slighted that this year’s auction will only fetch them licences for 10 years.,"ISLAMABAD: If the grapevine within the telecom sector is to be believed, the upcoming cellular spectrum auction for the 2,100 megahertz (MHz) band is shaping up to be another ‘one-horse race’. 
The spectrum auction advisory committee, headed by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, has resolved to auction off two 5 MHz bandwidth slots in the 2,100 MHz band for a 10-year period.
Most players in the telecom sector feel slighted that this year’s auction will only fetch them licences for a 10-year period, as opposed to the previous practice of auctioning off 15-year licences.
Industry insiders say the reduced duration will not only make it cheaper for telecom companies to acquire licences at auction, but will also allow the successful party to divert funds (which would otherwise be used to pay for the licence) to updating technical infrastructure.
Since the previous auction fetched $29 million apiece for 15-year licences, a 10-year one would theoretically cost $19.34 million.
In background conversations, officials from companies who have already obtained 15-year licences — i.e. Jazz, Zong and Ufone — objected to this, saying that since the option was never available to them, it would amount to giving one operator an advantage over the rest of the field, as they would have to invest less capital for the sake of licensing alone. 
Although the finance minister did not respond to a query regarding the reduced licence duration, IT Minister Syed Aminul Haque insisted there is nothing wrong with reducing the tenure of the licence. “The 2,100 MHz band has been offered for auction be­cause it was available. Besi­des, the duration has been reduced to facilitate telcos, to make it affordable for them to invest,” he told Dawn.
While this looks fair on paper, it has not gone down well with Ufone, which won a 9 MHz slot in the 1,800 MHz band last September. 
Hatem Bamatraf, president and group CEO of PTCL – the parent company of Ufone – has publicly opposed the terms of the sale, arguing that it was unfair to ease conditions for the fresh auction. 
He is also on the record as saying that Ufone isn’t interested in participating in the upcoming exercise.
The reason for this, according to a senior Ufone official, is simple. At last year’s auction, Ufone acquired around 70.3 per cent of the total spectrum offered. “It’s not even been a year. The company has yet to utilise its full potential,” the official said.
Another concern is that the government is only auctioning the 2,100 MHz band and not the bandwidth left over from the previous auction, in the 1,800 MHz band.
“This (auction) only suits Telenor because their core 4G operates at 2,100 MHz, whereas the other three telcos are operating in the 1,800 MHz band,” a senior telco executive told Dawn.
This means that if Telenor were to acquire the license, they would be able to roll out advanced 4G services without having to overhaul their technical infrastructure, since it already operates within the given band.
But Telenor Pakistan disputes this impression. In a statement issued in response to questions posed by Dawn, the company said the impression that “the upcoming auction is meant to favour one operator is completely inaccurate”.
The statement said that in view of last year’s “failed spectrum auction”, Telenor had requested the government to make the spectrum available at more appropriate terms to all interested parties in a transparent manner. 
Frequency Allocation Board (FAB) data shows that Telenor sits on 57.2 bandwidth in various megahertz, a little higher than Ufone’s 55.2.
However, Telenor has a low presence in the 1,700 and 1,800 MHz bands, whereas it enjoys significant space in the smaller 800 MHz band.
The Telenor statement says Pakistan has one of the lowest allocated spectrums in the region, compared to its much higher requirements. “The unused spectrum is of no benefit to anyone, and only a missed opportunity to bring investment and connectivity to the country.” 
High-band is suited to densely populated cities and locations that generate lots of mobile data traffic and so need the higher capacity that high-band has to offer. However, high-band coverage is generally limited and is affected by the environment in which it is deployed — for instance, surrounding high-rise buildings.
In contrast, low-band offers far greater coverage and much better building penetration capabilities and is more suitable for less densely populated rural areas.
Telco insiders say that Telenor can easily take advantage of the position it enjoys in the low-band to deploy services along highways – especially those being constructed along the CPEC routes.
Independent analysts, for their part, believe that there is still room for experimentation in this sector. “It makes more sense to launch a cheaper spectrum during these hard times rather than not selling anything for a year or so,” said Amir Ata, an Islamabad-based technology blogger and analyst.
He recalled that when Pakistan experimented with the launch of 3G and 4G technology at the same time during the 2014 spectrum auction, and it was so successful that Zong launched 4G mobile services in the country from the 1800 MHz band.
In addition, the three previous auctions also saw participation limited to one bidder, i.e. Ufone in 2021, Jazz in 2017, and Telenor in 2016.
It was only in the country’s first next-generation mobile spectrum auction in 2014 that all telecom companies placed bids to get a chunk of 1,800 and 2,100 MHz bands.

6,"Can parliament make ‘self-serving’ laws, wonders CJP","Not joyful enterprise for courts to legislate or show over activism, but have to protect Constitution and rule of law, he says.","ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pak­is­tan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial on Fri­day wondered whether the parliament could be expected to make a “self-serving legislation” when it’s in a “transitory period and the elections have to be held”.
“We are the guardians of the Constitution and it is not a joyful enterprise for the courts to do legislation instead or show over activism. But we have to protect the Constitution, the constitutional machinery and the rule of law,” observed the CJP.
The observation came during the hea­ring of a challenge by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan, through his counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, to rec­ent amendments made to the Nat­ional Accountability Ordinance (NAO). 
Headed by the CJP, the three-judge Supreme Court bench that heard the case has Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah as its other members. 

SC hears Imran’s petition against changes to NAO; govt lawyer says courts must not get involved in political disputes

“These are not ordinary times but exceptional times where the erstwhile ruling party was not performing its duties since it has boycotted out of the parliament while the beneficiaries were amending laws,” regretted the CJP.
Justice Shah wondered if the court should bother about the political temperature outside and asked which forum the people should approach to seek remedy if they were upset in case NAO was completely repealed in future.
Senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan, who appeared on behalf of the federal government, replied by citing that the United States Supreme Court always followed the latest election results, meaning they stood with the government in power while deciding constitutional cases.
‘Greater burden on courts’
In a society or a country where the parliamentary process was not working properly and when the fundamental rights were suspended, then there was a greater burden on the courts, but a different approach had to be taken if the democratic and constitutional dispensation were functioning smoothly, the counsel argued.
He cited a number of examples to show that the Supreme Court in the US had changed its views over the years on issues like death sentence, abortion and in the flag salute case, saying resolution of controversies should be confined always to the parliamentary forums instead of allowing them to be decided on the streets.

“We are conscious of the fact,” the CJP observed, adding the court should not enter the political thicket “but we also have to take into view the fundamental guarantees to the citizens like due process, fair trial and fairness in the criminal judicial process”.
The court postponed further proceedings until Sept 1 when Khawaja Haris said he had recovered from Covid only the other day and therefore could not submit a concise statement in time.
The right forum
Answering the questions raised in the petition, Makhdoom Ali Khan in a statement explained that the forum to enact or oppose the enactment of statutes was parliament. Politicians might succeed or fail in the parliament in pursuit of their objectives and those frustrated could take their appeal to people, he said, adding that was their right but the remedy for their grievances was not with courts. 
The counsel emphasised that courts could judge the constitutionality of statutes but could not test a statute on the criteria of a particular political outlook or a moral viewpoint or a philosophical approach.
He argued that if followed, the route suggested by the petitioner would lead straight to the political thicket,  adding that [courts should] always resist or avoid being embroiled in such disputes.
The counsel emphasised that the petitioner lacks locus standi and bona fide to move the present petition since the amendments of similar nature were made through ordinances in the NAO during the petitioner’s term as the prime minister. It is thus clear that this petition does not raise constitutional but political questions, the counsel said, especially when the apex court has repeatedly held that it does not decide political questions.
He argued that a statute cannot be struck down on the basis of principles of policy, objectives resolution and Article 2A of the constitution, especially when the petition seeks to create an impression that the offence of corruption has been abolished by the amendment, which is incorrect and that the legislative intent is clear in the amendments.
