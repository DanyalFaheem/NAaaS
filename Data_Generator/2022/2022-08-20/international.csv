0,Palestinian killed in Israeli attack,"TUBAS: A Palestinian man died of his wounds on Friday after Israeli forces shot him, the Palestinian health ministry...","TUBAS: A Palestinian man died of his wounds on Friday after Israeli forces shot him, the Palestinian health ministry said, during what Israel’s military said was an early morning raid against suspected militants in the occupied West Bank.
Salah Tawfiq Sawafta, 58, was shot in the head in the West Bank city of Tubas, the Palestinian ministry said. His nephew said Sawafta was walking home from a mosque when he was hit.
Videos circulating on social media appeared to show Sawafta the moment he was shot. Gunshots could be heard as Sawafta, wearing the traditional jalabiya robe, rushed to take cover inside a bakery before falling to the ground at the entrance.
“Sheikh Salah was walking home when he called on Abu Obada (the bakery owner) to enter because gunshots had sounded,” said Zakaria Sawafta, 27, an eyewitness.  “Seconds before he reached the bakery, they shot him in the head.” 
He said Israeli forces were positioned on top of a tall building nearby and that there were no clashes in that area.
The Israeli military said Palestinians in Tubas had hurled Molotov cocktails and opened fire at its forces, who responded by firing back.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh condemned Sawafta’s killing and said in a statement that Israel’s “terrorism” will continue as long as it is allowed to act with impunity.
Overnight, the military arrested five suspects from Tubas and the nearby town of Tammun who were allegedly involved in planning “terror attacks”, it said in a statement.
European states question Israeli action
Nine European countries, including France and Germany, said on Friday they were “deeply concerned” by the Israeli government’s forced closure of several Palestinian NGOs operating in occupied West Bank.
The Israeli military conducted overnight raids of seven organisations in Ramallah, the West Bank city where the Palestinian Authority’s headquarters are located, on Thursday.
“We are deeply concerned by the raids which took place in the morning of Aug 18, as part of a worrying reduction of space for civil society” in the territory, the foreign ministries of the nine countries said.
“These actions are not acceptable,” Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden said in a statement.
Six of the Palestinian organisations were labelled last October as terrorist groups by Israel for their alleged links to the leftist militant group Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, although Israeli officials have not publicly shared any evidence of the links.

1,IS ‘Beatles’ member jailed for life in US,Convicted of deaths of four American hostages in Syria.,"ALEXANDRIA: A member of the militant Islamic State  cell known as the “Beatles” was sentenced to life in prison by a US court on Friday for the deaths of four American hostages in Syria.
El Shafee Elsheikh, 34, was given eight concurrent life sentences after being convicted in April of hostage-taking, conspiracy to murder US citizens and supporting a terrorist organisation.
Judge T.S. Ellis said Elsheikh’s conduct “can only be described as horrific, barbaric, brutal, callous and, of course, criminal” as he handed down the sentence in Alexandria, Virginia.
Elsheikh, wearing large glasses, a black face mask and a dark green prison jumpsuit, gave no visible reaction to the sentencing.
The two-week trial of the former British national, which featured emotional testimony from former hostages and parents of the victims, was the most significant prosecution of an IS militant in the United States.
Diane Foley, mother of murdered hostage James Foley, in a statement to the court on Friday addressed Elsheikh, saying “your hate-filled crimes did not win... You have been held accountable for your depravity.
“Love is much stronger than hatred. I pity you Elsheikh for choosing hatred.” At the trial, the jury had deliberated for less than six hours before finding Elsheikh guilty for his role in the deaths of four Americans _ journalists Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller.
Elsheikh and another former “Beatle”, Alexanda Amon Kotey, were captured by a Kurdish militia in Syria in January 2018 and handed over to US forces in Iraq.
They were flown to the United States in 2020 to face trial.
Gruesome videos of beheadings 
Kotey, 38, pleaded guilty in September last year and was sentenced to life in prison in April.
Another alleged “Beatle”, Aine Davis, 38, has been deported to Britain from Turkiye and remanded in custody on terrorism charges.
The fourth “Beatle”, executioner Mohammed Emwazi, was killed by a US drone in Syria in 2015.
The hostage-takers, who grew up and were radicalised in London, were nicknamed the Beatles by their captives because of their distinctive British accents.
Active in Syria from 2012 to 2015, they are accused of abducting more than 20 journalists and relief workers from the United States and other countries.
Ten former European and Syrian hostages testified at Elsheikh’s trial accusing the Beatles of months of brutal treatment including beatings, electric shocks, waterboarding and mock executions.
Foley, Sotloff and Kassig were beheaded by Emwazi, and videos of their deaths were released by IS for propaganda purposes.
Mueller was initially held by the Beatles but was later turned over to IS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, who reportedly raped her repeatedly.
IS announced Mueller’s death in February 2015. The group said she was killed in a Jordanian airstrike, a claim disputed by US authorities.
Baghdadi died during a US special forces raid in 2019.
Ahead of Elsheikh’s sentencing, British police revealed details on Wednesday of the years-long effort to identify the hostage-takers and bring them to justice.
Richard Smith, the head of London police’s counter-terrorism unit, compared it to “putting together very small pieces of a jigsaw” and following a  trail of breadcrumbs”. 
Elsheikh declined to address the court on Friday, but his attorneys said he intended to appeal the verdict on the grounds of “ineffective counsel”.

2,Foreign engagement will be in line with Sharia: Taliban,Issue resolution saying any neighbouring country that allowed use of airspace for drone strike that killed Zawahiri is complicit.,"PESHAWAR: The Taliban will deal with the international community in line with Sharia, the supreme leader of the group said, according to a copy of his speech shared by the information ministry on Friday. 
Yet to be formally recognised as a government by any foreign capital, the group is struggling with a severe economic crisis due to strict enforcement of international sanctions and the cutting off of development aid. 
Many governments, including Washington, have put pressure on the Taliban to ease its restrictions on women and to open schools for high-school aged girls.
Around 3,000 tribal leaders, officials and religious scholars had gathered in the southern city of Kandahar, where the group’s supreme spiritual leader Haibatullah Akhundzada is based, on Thursday, according to state-run news agency Bakhtar. It was the second such gathering since the group took power around a year ago. 
“This meeting is called to think about the freedom we received by the blessing of Allah, which we achieved from the blood of our Mujahideen (fighters),” he said in the speech. 
“We will deal with the international community as per Islamic Sharia ...if Sharia doesn’t allow it, we will not deal with any other country,” Akhundzada said. 
Talks with US diplomats have continued, in particular over how to revive the country’s stalled banking sector and the possible release of frozen central bank assets held overseas. But officials have cautioned that many hurdles remain to any progress. 
In an escalation of tensions, the United States last month carried out a drone strike in central Kabul to kill Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri and accused the Taliban of violating an agreement between them by sheltering Zawahiri. 
Thursday’s gathering issued several resolutions, according to Bakhtar news agency, including one condemning the drone strike and another saying any neighbouring country that allowed the use of its airspace for the strike was complicit. 
The United States usually needs to receive permission from neighbouring nations to access landlocked Afghanistan via air. 
Officials have not disclosed the drone’s travel path. Pakistan has said its airspace was not used for the attack.

3,Putin allows IAEA inspectors to visit plant via Ukraine,ODESSA: Russian President Vladimir Putin has allowed  a team of independent inspectors to travel to the...,"ODESSA: Russian President Vladimir Putin has allowed  a team of independent inspectors to travel to the Moscow-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant via Ukraine, the French presidency said on Friday.
The apparent resolution of a dispute over whether inspectors travel to the plant via Ukraine or Russia came as a senior US defence official claimed Ukraine’s forces had brought the Russian advance to a halt.
“You are seeing a complete and total lack of progress by the Russians on the battlefield,” the official said.
According to French President Emmanuel Macron’s office, Putin had “reconsidered the demand” that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) travel through Russia to the site, after the Russian leader himself warned fighting there could bring about a “catastrophe”.
It specified that Putin had dropped his demand that the IAEA team travel to the site via Russia, saying it could arrive via Ukraine.
The UN nuclear watchdog’s chief, Rafael Grossi,  “welcomed recent statements indicating that both Ukraine and Russia supported the IAEA’s aim to send a mission to” the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant.

4,Scholz under fire in tax fraud probe,HAMBURG: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday denied helping a bank avoid paying back millions in tax rebates...,"HAMBURG: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Friday denied helping a bank avoid paying back millions in tax rebates claimed under a huge fraud scam as he answered to a committee investigating the scandal.
The parliamentary committee in Hamburg is probing why local finance authorities dropped a bid in 2016 to claw back 47 million euros ($48m) in taxes from private bank M. M. Warburg over so-called cum-ex trades.
Scholz was the mayor of Hamburg from 2011 to 2018 and has lately been repeatedly forced to beat back allegations he was involved in the decision to let the bank off the hook.
Arriving at the hearing, the chancellor eyed the room with a grim expression before swearing that he would tell the truth.
He then reiterated his innocence, declaring: “I had no influence on the Warburg tax proceedings.” 
First exposed in 2017, the “cum-ex” scam involved numerous participants swiftly exchanging company shares amongst themselves around dividend day to claim multiple tax rebates on a single payout.
The scam cost the government billions and has seen bankers, stock traders, lawyers and financial consultants indicted.
Warburg eventually had to pay back tens of millions of euros under pressure from the federal government under then chancellor Angela Merkel.
Scholz appeared calm and confident at the Hamburg hearing, standing by statements he made in a previous testimony before the committee in 2021.
He described allegations of political influence in the Warburg case as “false and recognisably not supported by anything or anyone”.
Dismal ratings 
The grilling comes as Scholz is already facing dismal popularity ratings after his first six months in office were tarnished by criticism over his perceived weak response to the war in Ukraine.
More recently, the chancellor has struggled to reassure Germans over possible energy shortages this winter and the very real prospect of a recession in Europe’s biggest economy.
During the hearing on Friday, Scholz was asked about conversation he is alleged to have had in 2016 with Christian Olearius, then head of Warburg bank.
Critics have accused Scholz of making contradictory statements on his contacts with Olearius, initially admitting he had met the banker before later appearing to deny it.
The chancellor insisted he had no specific memories of any meetings with Olearius, pointing out that he had held a number of meetings with business figures during his time in Hamburg.
“There is not the slightest hint anywhere” of anything untoward being agreed in such meetings, he said, insisting he always behaved “correctly”.
‘Lapses of memory’ 
Scholz also denied exerting any influence “before or after the meetings” and said the city of Hamburg had suffered  “no financial damage in this matter”.
Friedrich Merz, the leader of the opposition conservatives, told a newspaper he did “not believe a word the chancellor says”.
“There is hardly anyone in Germany who believes Olaf Scholz’s many lapses of memory,” he said.
Johannes Kahrs, a former MP with Scholz’s Social Democrats (SPD), is also under investigation as part of the Hamburg probe.
According to German media, investigators recently found around 200,000 euros in cash in a bank safe deposit box belonging to Kahrs, though it is unclear whether the find has anything to do with the cum-ex scandal.

5,Gunmen attack Mogadishu hotel,MOGADISHU: Al-Shabaab fighters attacked a hotel in the Somali capital Mogadishu in a hail of gunfire and explosions...,"MOGADISHU: Al-Shabaab fighters attacked a hotel in the Somali capital Mogadishu in a hail of gunfire and explosions on Friday, with casualties reported, security sources and witnesses said.
The assault on the Hayat Hotel triggered a fierce gunfight between security forces and gunmen from the jihadist group who are still holed up inside the building, security official Abdukadir Hassan said.
The Al-Qaeda-linked jihadist group, which has been waging a deadly insurgency against Somalia’s fragile central government for about 15 years, claimed responsibility.
Ambulance officials gave an injury toll of three, while witnesses at the scene at an intersection known as KM4 reported another two had been wounded.
“A huge blast went off a few minutes before the gunmen forced their way into the hotel,” Hassan said.
“We don’t have the details so far but there are casualties, and the security forces are now engaging with the enemy who are holed up inside the building,” he added.
Somali police spokesman Abdifatah Adan Hassan later told reporters that the initial blast was caused by a suicide bomber who attacked the hotel with several other gunmen.
The assailants  “are now being engaged by the police forces, they will be neutralised very soon”, he said.
It was not immediately clear if security forces had taken back control of the hotel and if the attack was over.
Witnesses said a second blast occurred outside the hotel just a few minutes after the first, inflicting casualties on rescuers and members of the security forces and civilians who rushed to the scene after the first explosion.
“The area is cordoned off now and there is exchange of gunfire between the security forces and the gunmen,” said one witness, Mohamed Salad.
The militants claimed the attack in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website.
“A group of Al-Shabaab attackers forcibly entered Hotel Hayat in Mogadishu, the fighters are carrying out random shooting inside the hotel,” the group said in a brief statement on a pro-Shabaab website.
The Hayat is a popular spot in Mogadishu in an area where several other hotels are located, and it is frequented by government officials and civilians.

6,Baldwin expects no charges over fatal movie set accident,LOS ANGELES: Holly­wood actor Alec Baldwin said on Friday he did not believe anyone would be criminally charged ...,"LOS ANGELES: Holly­wood actor Alec Baldwin said on Friday he did not believe anyone would be criminally charged over the fatal shooting on the set of Western film  Rust, telling CNN he had hired a private investigator to assess culpability for the tragedy.
Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died after being hit by a live round that came from a gun Baldwin was holding as he rehearsed on the New Mexico set of the low-budget movie last October.
A criminal investigation into the shooting is still ongoing, and prosecutors have not yet ruled out charges against those involved. “I sincerely believe... (investigators are) going to say that this was an accident. It’s tragic,” said Baldwin, in a rare interview about the episode.
Baldwin told CNN he had replayed the events leading up to the shooting over and over for the past 10 months, and had even hired a private investigator.
While insisting he does not want to “condemn” Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film set’s armourer and props assistant, Baldwin pointed the finger of blame at her and assistant director Dave Halls, who handed him the gun moments before the shooting.

7,Glasgow museum to repatriate Indian artefacts,The seven cultural artefacts were taken away during British rule.,"GLASGOW: The Scottish city of Glasgow held a ceremony on Friday to repatriate seven Indian cultural artefacts taken away during British rule, calling it a first for a UK museum service.
Dignitaries from the High Commission of India joined members of Glasgow Life, the charity that manages the Scottish city’s museum collections, at the transfer of ownership ceremony, following more than 18 months of talks.
Six of the items were stolen from northern India in the 1800s, and a seventh was illegally purchased after being stolen from its original owners.
All seven objects were looted from sacred places such as temples and shrines and given as gifts to the Scottish city’s museum collection.
“Glasgow has led repatriation efforts in the UK since 1998,” said Duncan Dornan, head of museums at Glasgow Life.
“We look forward to continuing our work with the Indian authorities to deliver the safe return of these artefacts.” 
In all, Glasgow is set to return 51 items to the descendants of their rightful owners from India and Nigeria, as well as the Cheyenne River and Oglala Sioux tribes in the US state of South Dakota.
In March, Glasgow’s city council apologised for the city’s role in the Atlantic slave trade, after a study into streets, buildings and individuals linked to the practice.
Glasgow’s repatriation commitment is part of a wider reassessment of the provenance of items in Western museums, in the wake of global anti-racism movements.
Earlier this year, two British universities returned two Benin bronzes looted by British colonialists in the 19th century to Nigeria.

8,Afghan turmoil holds up Asian power project,CASA-1000 project aims to allow Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to sell excess energy to Pakistan and Afghanistan in summer months.,"DUSHANBE: A $1.2 billion Western-backed project to build a power line between Central Asia and South Asia has been stalled by turmoil in Afghanistan, a project official said on Friday.
The CASA-1000 project aims to allow Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, former Soviet republics with an extensive network of hydroelectric power plants, to sell excess energy to Pakistan and Afghanistan in the summer months.
Faizali Samiyev, the head of the Tajik project implementation office, said work on the project, originally scheduled to be completed next year, was going ahead in three countries, but not in Afghanistan.
While the World Bank, a key CASA-1000 backer, continues financing projects in Afghanistan, it has decided to focus on urgently needed education, agriculture, health and family programmes and bypass sanctioned Taliban authorities by disbursing the money through United Nations agencies and international aid groups.
Funding for the CASA-1000 project _ which was designed to provide Pakistan with 1,000 megawatts (MW) of power and Afghanistan with 300 MW _ has been suspended, Samiyev said.
“We hope that contacts will be established with the Afghan side and ways to implement the project will be worked out,” he said.
The project could be a boon for the two Central Asian nations which have excess power in the summer, but suffer from shortage in the winter unless they can buy fuel or power from neighbours.
The United States was involved in financing the project when it was launched in 2016 as part of its New Silk Road initiative to integrate Afghanistan with Central Asia. Other project sponsors include the Islamic Development Bank, the UK Department for International Development, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

9,US unveils $775m arms package for Ukraine,"""We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs,"" says US defence official.","WASHINGTON: The US Defence Department announced on Friday a $775 million package of defence equipment and ammunition for Ukraine, including various types of missiles, artillery and mine-clearing systems.
The package includes more precision-guided missiles for the Himars systems that have permitted Ukrainian forces to strike Russian command centres and munitions depots far behind the front lines, and more anti-armour weapons,  including TOW missiles and Javelin systems.
It also includes Scan Eagle surveillance drones,high-speed anti-radiation (HARM) missiles that hone in on ground-based radar systems, and 105mm howitzers, along with 36,000 artillery rounds for them.
“We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that’s what we’re doing with this package,” a senior US defense official told reporters.
The official said Ukraine’s forces had made good use of the now 19 packages of arms the United States had  provided, helping them blunt the advance of Russian forces.
“You are seeing a complete and total lack of progress by the Russians on the battlefield,” the official said.
“You are seeing the Russians still paying a high price with Ukrainian attacks, especially using that Himars system,” the official said.
“They are incurring these costs and not able to advance.” The official conceded that the Ukrainians themselves had not been able to recapture significant territory along the front lines in the country’s east and south.
But the new package of arms will help fortify them, the official said, noting it was very important to be able to  “sustain the successes that we’ve seen from the Ukrainians on the battlefield”. 
The official said the addition of mine-clearing equipment, which includes 40 mine-resistant vehicles with rollers that can safely explode mines, is to help the Ukrainians with more offensive actions.
“The Ukrainians will need this sort of capability to be able to push their forces forward and retake territory,” the official said.
Likewise, the provision of HARM missiles aims at eroding Russian air defences.
The air-to-surface missiles hone in on the emissions from radar systems and can be used to attack from 50 kilometres away.
Russia’s Black Sea fleet 
Blasts at the Saky air base in the annexed Crimean peninsula earlier this month have put more than half of the Russian Black Sea fleet’s naval aviation combat jets out of use, a Western official said on Friday.
The air base near Novofedorivka, on the west coast of the peninsula, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, suffered multiple explosions on Aug 9.
The official said Ukraine was now consistently achieving  “kinetic effects” deep behind Russia’s lines. This was having a material impact on Russia’s logistics support and  “a significant psychological effect on the Russian leadership”.
“We now assess that the events of Saky airfield on Aug 9 put more than half of Black Sea fleet’s naval aviation combat jets out of use,” the official said.
On Aug 12, Britain’s defence ministry said in its intelligence update that while a fraction of Russia’s air fleet was destroyed in the blast, the navy’s air capability was seriously degraded.

10,Sri Lanka’s ousted president keen to return home,"Has asked his successor to guarantee his safety, says his party said.","COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s deposed former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa is seeking to return home from his exile in Thailand and has asked his successor to guarantee his safety, his party said on Friday.
Rajapaksa fled the island last month after a huge crowd stormed his house, capping months of white-hot public anger over the island nation’s unprecedented economic crisis.
The 73-year-old was forced to flee his official residence with the help of the military and eventually issued his resignation from Singapore.
He has since flown to Thailand, but authorities there have warned him not to venture out of his hotel for his own safety, keeping him virtually under hotel arrest.
Rajapaksa’s youngest bro­ther Basil, the former finance minister, met the deposed leader’s successor Ranil Wickremesinghe on Thur­sday and requested protection to allow his return, their party said in a statement.
“Basil Rajapaksa reque­sted the president to make arrangements for the former president to return home,” the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party said in a statement.
“The main demand of the SLPP is the safety and security of the former president.” 
The SLPP has an overwhelming majority in parliament and Wickremesinghe’s administration relies on the party’s lawmakers to govern.
Rajapaksa came to power promising “vistas of prosperity and splendour” in 2019, but saw his popularity plummet as the country’s 22 million people endured fuel shortage, blackout and runaway inflation.

“We are appalled by the sentencing of Saudi doctoral student Salma al Shehab... in connection with a series of tweets and retweets on political and human rights issues in Saudi Arabia,” Liz Throssell, spokeswoman for the UN rights office, said in a statement. “We urge the Saudi authorities to quash her conviction and release her immediately and unconditionally,” she said.
“She should never have been arrested and charged in the first place for such conduct.” Salma Shehab, a member of the Shia community, had been studying for a doctorate in Britain and was arrested in January last year while on holiday.
On Aug 9 she was sentenced to 34 years in jail for aiding dissidents seeking to “disrupt public order” in Saudi Arabia by relaying their tweets. The 34-year-old mother of two was also banned from travelling abroad for a further 34 years as part of the sentence. Throssell, the UN spokeswoman, said Salma Shehab’s  “extraordinarily lengthy sentence” added to “the chilling effect among government critics and civil society at large”.

12,Chinese city dims lights to cope with power crunch,"BEIJING: A provincial capital in south-western China has dimmed outdoor advertisements, subway lighting and building...","BEIJING: A provincial capital in south-western China has dimmed outdoor advertisements, subway lighting and building signs to save energy, official announcements said, as the area battles a power crunch triggered by record-high temperatures.
The mercury has soared beyond 40 degrees Celsius in Sichuan province this week, fuelling massive demand for air conditioning and drying up reservoirs in a region reliant on dams for most of its electricity.
Factories, including a joint venture with Japanese car giant Toyota in provincial capital Chengdu, have been forced to halt work, while millions in another city Dazhou grappled with rolling power cuts.
“Hot and muggy weather has caused the city’s electricity supply for production and daily life to be pushed to its limit,” Chengdu’s urban management authorities said in a notice on social media on Thursday.
Faced with a “most severe situation”, the city _ home to over 20 million people _ ordered landscape illumination and outdoor advertising lights to be switched off in notices issued on Tuesday, the statement said.
Building name signs will also be darkened.
The Chengdu metro said in a video on China’s Twitter-like platform Weibo that it would also turn off advertisement lights and “optimise” the temperature in stations to save energy.
Photos circulating on Weibo showed dimmed lights on metro platforms, walkways and in malls, with commuters walking in partial darkness.
The searing heat is also drying up the critical Yangtze River, with water flow on its main trunk about 50 percent lower than the average over the last five years, state media outlet China News Service reported on Thursday.
Sichuan’s power woes could have ripple effects on the wider Chinese economy — the province is a key supplier of energy generated by hydropower to eastern industrial powerhouses including Jiangsu and Zhejiang.
China is battling extreme weather on several fronts, with 18 people killed and 13 still missing after a flash flood in the northwest of the country on Thursday sparked by torrential rains.
Weather authorities in the eastern Jiangsu province warned drivers of tyre puncture risks on Friday as the surface temperature of some roads was poised to hit 68 degrees Celsius.
The China Meteorological Administration earlier said the nation was going through its longest period of sustained high temperatures since records began in 1961.
Scientists say extreme weather across the world has become more frequent due to climate change and that urgent global cooperation is needed to slow an impending disaster.
The world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters are the United States and China. But this month Beijing announced it was freezing its cooperation with Washington on global warming in protest against a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.

Marin, 36, also said her ability to perform her official duties had remained unimpaired on the Saturday night in question and that she would have left the party had she been required to work.
Video clips of Marin partying with well-known Finnish influencers and artists began circulating in social media this week and they were soon published by several media outlets in Finland and abroad.
“In recent days, there have been quite grave public accusations that I was in a space where drugs were used, or that I myself used drugs,” Marin told a news conference.
“I consider these accusations to be very serious and, though I consider the demand for a drug test unjust, for my own legal protection and to clear up any doubts, I have taken a drug test today, the results of which will come in about a week.”
