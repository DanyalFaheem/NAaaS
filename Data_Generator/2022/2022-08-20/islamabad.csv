Police officers told Dawn that a PTI leader in a video message posted on social media asked party workers and activists to come over to Pims as Imran Khan was reaching there. 
After getting information, a contingent of well-equipped 400 policemen, including Anti-Riot Unit and Counter-Terrorism Squad personnel, were deployed in and around the hospital, including the private ward where Mr Gill has been kept.
In the meantime, PTI workers and activists started arriving at Pims before sunset and shortly around 500 people assembled in and around the hospital. 
At around sunset, Imran Khan accompanied by local PTI leaders reached the hospital and moved towards the private ward. 
However, the senior superintendent of police (operations) along with a contingent of police deployed in front of the building intercepted him.
The police disallowed the PTI chief from visiting Mr Gill saying as he was in the custody of court through the police, the officers said. 
Besides, permission of court was necessary to meet Mr Gill, he was told. Mr Khan remained there for half an hour and later left, they added.
During his presence, the police warned the PTI activists to remain peaceful to avoid the use of force against them. Fortunately, no misshape took place, the officers added.
Mr Gill is admitted to a room on the third floor of the private ward. 
Two policemen were also deployed with him inside the room while a team of 22 personnel are on duty on the corridor of the floor, lift and the entry points of the ward.
The contingent of a total of 400 personnel was to be called back from the hospital by Friday night after an evaluation of the situation, the officers added.
The capital police on Thursday night issued an advertisement on behalf of the DIG headquarters stating that any person having evidence related to the case registered against Mr Gill or about alleged torture on the accused could record his testimony at the office of the IGP at Police Lines Headquarters on Aug 20 (today) from 8am to 12pm.
However, some officers were of the view that Mr Gill had been detained at an undisclosed location and how anyone from the public could know if he was subjected to torture or not.
A police spokesman said the medical board in its report issued earlier had confirmed that there was no sign of torture on Mr Gill’s body. However, the advertisement was issued under the directives of court.
In this regard, a meeting was held on Thursday and attended by investigators and all the officers concerns. 
A team was constituted under the supervision of the DIG headquarters which will record the statements of the investigators and the staff of the police installation where Mr Gill was detained during his first physical remand, he added.
Citizens desirous of appearing before the team during the given time can do so and produce any evidence that would be recorded, he added.
Meanwhile, a notification issued on July 23 imposing a ban on gathering of five or more people in the capital was again shared on the official twitter account of the deputy commissioner (DC) Islamabad on Friday night. 
It stated that there was already a ban on all types of gatherings, rallies and processions in the capital along with gathering of five or more people.

2,New design for remodeling of Rawalpindi's Kutchery Chowk approved,Aimed at catering to maximum traffic on the main junction of the garrison city.,"RAWALPINDI: The Provincial Development Working Party (PDWP) has approved a new design for the remodeling of Kutchery Chowk to cater to maximum traffic on the main junction of the garrison city.
The project will be completed in 24 months without the closure of traffic on the main square.
Under the new design, a flyover will be constructed to cater to traffic coming from Rawat side after construction of the Kharian Motorway which will connect to Grand Trunk Road and the proposed Rawalpindi Ring Road. This will provide an easy way to 131,500 vehicles per day. In the previous design, the remodeling would have catered to only 100,000 vehicles day.
The cost of the project has escalated from Rs4.879 billion to Rs6.422 billion due to the addition of the flyover and 25 per cent increase in the prices of construction material.
The board meeting was held to give approval to the new design with Planning and Development Board Chairman Abdullah Khan Sumbal in the chair. The design was presented by Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal and Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) Chief Engineer Dr Habibul Haq Randhawa.
A senior official of the Planning and Development told Dawn that the RDA had submitted the revised cost estimate of Rs4.879 billion inclusive of land acquisition to the Planning and Development Board for clearance. He said a rationalised cost of Rs4.879 billion was cleared at a meeting held on March 7, 2022. Different design options were outlined on the basis of the level of service improvement, project cost and traffic benefits.
After consultation with all stakeholders, the best possible option was selected, he added. However, now the RDA has come up with a revised PC-I due to the revised scope, comprising the addition of a flyover of Y-shaped to benefit traffic from Rawat to Saddar, Saddar to Rawat and Marrir Chowk to Rawat.
Under the project, the first level underpass will be constructed for Saddar to the old airport and from there to Saddar. Previously, there were level-2 underpass for Saddar to Rawat, Saddar to the airport with total six lanes.
The commissioner informed the forum that earlier the project was approved with a design having a two-level underpass but after discussion with all stakeholders the design was slightly amended to a Y-shaped flyover along with an underpass, keeping in view the security needs of the route.
The project was approved at a total cost of Rs6.422 billion with the gestation period of 24 months. The RDA shall reconsider the vertical clearance of proposed underpass for Iftikhar Janjua Road towards the airport-bound traffic from 3.6 metres to 5.3 metres.
RDA Chief Engineer Dr Habibul Haq Randhawa said Kutchery Chowk situated at the heart of city along GT Road was the signalised intersection of five major urban arteries. This included the airport road from Ammar Chowk, Rashid Minhas Road from Marrir Chowk, Adiala and Tufail roads on the southern side.
The presence of districts courts in its vicinity further worsens the traffic congestion especially during peak hours. Due to gravity of the existing situation, RDA has planned to conduct a feasibility study along with a detailed design for remodeling of the chowk.
Nespak had been entrusted the task through a competitive bidding to provide the best possible solution to the traffic congestion.
“The proposed improvement will provide uninterrupted flow of two-way traffic along GT Road (N-5) at Kutchery Chowk intersection, which will benefit the daily commuters apart from overcoming the traffic problems in terms of delays, fuel consumption,” he said.

3,Azad Kashmir offers jobs to 100 children of migrants from India-occupied Kashmir,"Government will spare Rs30m to advance interest free loans to refugees for small businesses, says AJK PM.","MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas on Friday announced that his government would provide public sector jobs to as many as 100 educated children from the families of post-1989 migrants from India-held Kashmir (IHK) in addition to their 6pc quota in this regard.
He also declared that the government would spare Rs30 million to advance interest free loans to refugees for small businesses and another Rs15 million for the education and weddings of their children.
He was speaking at a large ceremony in Ambore refugee camp, some 5km on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad, after handing over the copy of a recently issued notification, envisaging an increase of Rs1.500 in the monthly subsistence allowance of post-1989 migrants, to camp leader Chaudhry Ferozuddin.
“Today, I once again salute my valiant brethren across the Line of Control for their heroic struggle for freedom in spite of the unprecedented atrocities by India’s occupation machinery…At the same time, I also salute the spirit of all those who migrated from the occupied territory to the liberated territory for the same great cause,” PM Ilyas said in his emotional speech.
He said he had a great realisation of the miseries of the refugees because they were not provided with the facilities they deserved.
“For that very reason, today I also tender apologies to you,” he said.
According to AJK Rehabilitation Department, there are 11 major camps of post-1989 refugees in Muzaffarabad and Jhelum valley districts, housing 17,408 members from 3,115 families, while 6,766 members from 3,115 families inhabit five camps in Bagh district, and 4556 members from 814 families inhabit two camps in Kotli district.
Apart from them, as many as 14,380 migrants from 2,783 families are living in private residences in Muzaffarabad, Bagh, Kotli, Mirpur and Poonch district.
Each member was getting a monthly subsistence allowance of Rs2,000 with an additional Rs90 to the head of the family, apart from some other paltry allowances to children for education, etc.
Through the recently issued notification which would take effect from Sept 1, 2022, the subsistence allowance of all 43,110 refugees has been raised by Rs1,500, which would cost the government an additional Rs776 million per annum.
“Whatever amount of money we may give you in fact it can never be the substitute for your sacrifice of leaving the land of your forefathers,” the AJK premier said.
He assured them that the government would ensure 100 per cent implementation of refugees’ quota in public sector jobs.
On this occasion, the premier directed the authorities concerned to allocate 80 kanals of land for a graveyard at Ambore refugee camp.

5,Favourtism alleged during police officers’ promotion to DIG rank,"Additional secretary claims recommendations made after consensus, due deliberations...","ISLAMABAD: Some senior officials have shown concern over the promotion process for the Police Services of Pakistan (PSP) officers, alleging manipulation in favour of some personnel.
The additional secretary establishment, on the other hand, said the  Central Selection Board (CSB) in its proceedings had discussed each case on merit.
Sources in the Establishment Division and police told Dawn that a bureaucrat allegedly lobbied to get his relative and other blue-eyed officials promoted during the recently-convened CSB meeting
In this regard, composition of the promotion board was managed and also changed, the officers alleged, adding that the board meeting was also rescheduled at the last moment reportedly to avoid the presence of the IGP Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in it.

Additional secretary claims recommendations made after consensus, due deliberations

The meeting was scheduled to be held on Aug 11, but it was postponed and later held on Aug 12, and on that day KP’s police chief was busy in Swat, the officers said. Besides, there was no presence of senior police officers from Sindh.
However, chief secretaries of the provinces attended the meeting, but the feedback from police officers played a vital role.
There were 24 seats of DIG available and a panel comprising 48 officers, including those who were already promoted to the rank (DIG) and awaiting confirmation, was made for the promotion. 
However, the board superseded a majority of the officers having good reputation and higher ‘blood count’.
The term blood count is used for a score earned through training and courses like Mid Career Management Course, Senior Career Management Course and the Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs). A majority of the officers on top of the list were superseded.
The promotion board met on Aug 12 and only 18 vacant seats were filled out of the total 24 while promotion on seven seats was deferred. Out of the 18 promoted officers, nine were those who were ranked from 25 to 48 in the list.
The officers alleged that the process was carried out to favour an officer at the bottom of the list who happened to be  a relative of a bureaucrat. 
As per rules, officers facing an inquiry may not be promoted till they are found innocent or three years after the inquiry without any result, the sources said, but in this case, the officers who had even completed the required three years were left in the lurch against the established rules of promotion.
When contacted, Additional Secretary Establishment Waseem Mukhtar said the CSB in its proceedings discussed each case on merit and members gave their input. After consensus and due deliberations, the recommendation was recorded.
Before the presentation of the case of the relative of a senior bureaucrat to the CSB, full disclosure of the fact was made to the board by the senior bureaucrat himself. He then excused himself from the proceedings and left the meeting room. The case of the officer was then discussed by CSB on merit.
Replying to a question about the board composition which was changed twice, Mr Mukhtar said the name of MNA Usama Qadri and two BS-22 police officers were added to the board to complete the composition.
About the change of the meeting date to avoid appearance of the IGP KP, the additional secretary said the agenda for PSP officers was changed to Aug 12 on the request of provinces.
The CSB was convened immediately after Ashura and provinces requested that since the IGPs were busy in law and order duties relating to Muharram, the PSP agenda may be taken up on Friday (Aug 12).
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa IGP, at the last moment, informed through the chief secretary that since he was committed to his duties in view of the  security situation in Swat, he would not be able to attend the CSB meeting on Friday. However, the KP chief secretary attended the meeting.
Over the absence of police officers from Sindh, Mr Mukhtar said as per practice IGPs who were in BS-22 were members of the CSB agenda pertaining to PSP officers.
IGP Sindh is in BS-21 and representation from Sindh was made by the chief secretary.
About those who were promoted earlier and whose confirmation case was presented in the meeting but were demoted, the additional secretary stated every case was deliberated upon by the CSB on merit.

7,PTI plea to extend LB polls rejected,MUZAFFARABAD: The AJK’s Supreme Court on Friday turned down PTI government’s plea seeking local bodies (LB)...,"MUZAFFARABAD: The AJK’s Supreme Court on Friday turned down PTI government’s plea seeking local bodies (LB) elections next year and directed that the exercise be held by Nov 30.
Earlier, the top court had given a direction to hold these polls by Oct 15, following which the AJK Election Commission had issued the schedule for the electoral process, fixing Sept 28 for polling.
Angry at the commission’s decision in the face of allegedly controversial delimitations, flawed voter lists and some other allied issues, the government with the backing of opposition PPP and PML-N moved a constitutional amendment bill in the Legislative Assembly to create a separate constitutional body for holding LB polls. Simultaneously, the government had also moved an application in the apex court to gain an extension in its deadline for the polls.
During the arguments, government counsel Raja Sajjad Ahmed cited unavailability of paramilitary troopers from Pakistan to maintain law and order during the polls as well as the requisite financial resources apart from corrections in delimitations and voters lists as key reasons to delay the polls.
Their plea was, however, opposed by advocates Amjad Ali Khan and Haroon Riaz Mughal who appeared on behalf of civil society and said the apex court had alreadytaken a lenient view while extending the time more than once. ­
