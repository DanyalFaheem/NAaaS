1,"Domestic violence, academic failure pushing Chitral’s young women to commit suicide",Study shows 176 people ended life in region from 2013 to 2019 with 58pc being women.,"PESHAWAR: More young women are committing suicide than men in Chitral region due to domestic violence, academic failure and family pressure for marriage, shows a recent study published by the Pakistan Journal of Criminology.
According to the ‘Rising Trend of Suicides among Youth in Chitral: A Sociological Analysis’ conducted by teachers Noor Sanauddin and Dr Imran Sajid of the University of Peshawar and Zafar Ahmad of the Jehanzeb College Swat, 176 people ended life in Chitral region from 2013 to 2019 and 58 per cent of them (102) were women.
It noted that the 15-30 age bracket was the most vulnerable to suicide as 144 of 176 cases fell in it.
The study said women were more likely to end their life between 15 and 30 years of age as 92 of the women, who committed suicide during the period, belonged to that age bracket.

Study shows 176 people ended life in region from 2013 to 2019 with 58pc being women

According to it, 16 men, who had ended life, belonged to the 30-45 age group. It said the suicide tendency decreased sharply for both men and women aged 40 and above.
Researcher Zafar Ahmed told Dawn that he and other researchers analysed suicide cases in Chitral in light of French sociologist Emile Durkheim’s Theory of Suicide.
He said the study argued that the traditional culture of Chitral was subjected to drastic social change in a very short time.
Mr Ahmed said social change had made youth aware of their rights but their aspirations from the current modern times were thwarted by centuries-old local traditions.
“Culture, traditions and festivals, which once used to give socio-cultural identity to the individuals, have grown weak and so do the bonds and the meanings necessary for keeping individuals into a cohesive whole.
“The culture is in a state, where traditional norms tend to disappear yet are not fully replaced by the new ones, what could be called anomie. The mind has become split between tradition and modernity creating uncertainty regarding how to live a balanced life which has increased vulnerability towards suicide,” he said.
The study listed the family disputes or mostly issues with in-laws, violence by brothers or husbands, allegations of love affairs, cultural attitudes towards women’s role in marriage, marriage against parent’s will, the burden of work, high expectations and allegations for the bad socialisation, and academic failure of children as reason for women’s suicides.
Besides, it has also listed the academic pressure or craze for success as another reason for the growing suicide incidence.
The study noted that in the district, education was considered the ladder for social mobility and there was much emphasis on it creating a culture where success was worshipped and underachieving was demonised.
“A local intellectual said congratulating those who gain success in the job market or in academia is mandatory here. The local media and the social media glorify the achievers as the proud Chitrali (Fakhr-i-Chitral)” it said.
The study noted that family members instilled their dead aspirations into their children and the result was intense stress on the youths and frustrations for those who fail to secure good grades in exams.
“A young boy, who had attempted suicide, said ‘too much’ expectation had resulted in his academic failure and ultimately led him to attempt suicide. On one occasion, six female students committed suicide less than a week after exam results were declared,” it noted. Besides, it said that youths were also committing suicide as a protest or an act of revenge.
“In Chitral, the rapid social change has brought the aspirations of youth into a clash with traditions creating an annoyance for the youths. The youths protest by ending their own lives, perhaps they find no other option,” it said.
It said threatening to commit suicide was quite a familiar dialogue in Chitral.
The researchers noted that the traditional culture of Chitral was largely developed and preserved in isolation and remained aloof from the rest of the country due to the geographical isolation,
They added that local culture used to provide socio-cultural identity and security to the natives by binding them into a cohesive whole for centuries but that security started to vanish after the region suddenly witnessed drastic social change facilitated by the telecommunication revolution, education and investment in the social sector. “This phenomenon disturbed the traditional worldview which resulted in anomie,” the study said.
“Since young people are the agents of this change, their aspirations clash with the dominant traditions. A hostile environment is created for those who deviate from the traditional ethos. The situation is more severe for young women as socio-cultural taboos restrict their choices,” it added.
The study said sympathetic response of the community towards the victims, portraying them as the oppressed, condemning the potential perpetrators, surrendering to the demands of suicide survivors and, of course, the cultural unacceptability of homicide was creating a situation where anger internalised by the youths was expressed in the form of suicide.

4,Peshawar High court grants bail to two juveniles in assault case,"They are accused of sexually assaulting seven-year-old boy, filming crime and releasing video on social media.","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Friday granted bail to two juvenile persons charged with sexually assaulting a seven-year-old boy, filming the crime and releasing the video on social media.
Justice Mohammad Ijaz Khan of a single-member bench accepted a joint petition of the two suspects on the condition of furnishing two surety bonds of Rs100,000 each.
The bench observed that the records revealed that one suspect was 14 and the other 11 with the latter, according to the doctors, being unable to perform sexual intercourse.
It added that both suspects were schoolchildren, so that was also considered for the grant of bail to them.

They also face charges of filming crime, releasing video on social media

The bench observed that a Supreme Court judgement delivered in 2021 had extended the benefit of doubt to an accused even at the stage of bail by observing that the basic idea was to enable the accused to answer criminal prosecution against him rather than rot him behind the bars.
It added that every accused was innocent until his guilt was proved and that the benefit of doubt could be extended to the accused even at the stage of bail if the facts of the case warranted so.
“The basic philosophy of criminal jurisprudence is that the prosecution has to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and this principle applies at all stages, includingpre-trial one and even at the time of deciding whether accused is entitled to bail or nor,” the bench observed.
The FIR of the assault was registered at the Alpuri police station in Shangla district on June 15, 2022, under sections 377 (unnatural offence) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Pakistan Penal Code and sections 48 (child pornography) and 53 (sexual abuse) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection and Welfare Act.
Complainant in the case was the assault victim’s father said his son was a first grader in a local school. He said he learned from a viral video about his child’s sexual abuse by two suspects.
He said his son later confirmed that he was subjected to the crime when he was out in a forest to collecting firewood.
The boy told the complainant that the suspects had threatened him that if he informed anyone about the incident, he would be killed, so he kept quiet out of fear.
The bench observed that the records would reveal that though the prosecution had levelled allegations under Section 377 of the PPC against the suspects, but there was neither any medico-legal examination of their alleged victim nor any other evidence to support them as the alleged sexual assault wasn’t witnessed by anyone and instead, it was caught on camera.
It added that the video had been seized by the prosecution but the expert opinion on its originality was awaited, so the matter required further probe.

He said he had directed his staff to spread awareness among people that they should immediately contact the livestock department in case their cattle got infected with LSD.
