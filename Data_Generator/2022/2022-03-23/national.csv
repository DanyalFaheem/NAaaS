• COAS meets Saudi, Kyrgyz, Azerbaijani delegates     
ISLAMABAD: Noting that the ongoing second phase of the China-Pak­is­tan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would reinforce Pakistan’s efforts towards economic development with an enhanced cooperation in diverse areas, Prime Minister Imran Khan invi­ted Chinese investors to benefit from the lucrative investment opportunities in Pakistan. 
The PM made these rem­arks during a meeting with Chinese State Coun­cilor and For­eign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the OIC moot here on Tuesday. 
PM Khan and Mr Yi discussed the current trajectory of China-Pakistan bilateral ties, and the evolving regional and international scenario. The two sides also discussed the situation in Ukraine and reiterated the need for a solution through sustained dialogue and diplomacy.
Mr Khan briefed the Chinese leader on India’s egregious human rights violations in India-held Kash­m­­ir and its “irresponsible” behaviour that was an impe­d­­­iment to regional peace and security. 
He also apprised Mr Yi of the so-called accidental firing of a missile from India into Pakistan.
He also emphasised that Pakistan and China must continue deeper engagement to promote peace and stability in Afghanistan, and avert a humanitarian crisis there.
In his meeting with Palestinian Foreign Minister Dr Riyad al-Maliki, the prime minister maintained that the Palestinian tragedy was at the heart of the turmoil in the Middle East. He reiterated Islam­abad’s unequivocal support for the rights of the Palestinian people and their just struggle.
Later, in a meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein, Mr Khan reiterated Pakistan’s support for the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Iraq.

Pakistan announced un­­conditional support for Saudi Arabia’s candidature to host the World Expo 2030 in Riyadh. The assurance came when Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi met his Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud on the sidelines of the OIC foreign ministers gathering here. 
Prince Faisal thanked Pakistan for supporting the kingdom’s bid at the 169th General Assembly of Bureau International des Expo­sit­i­ons, scheduled for December 2023.
Prince Faisal underscored the importance that Saudi Arabia attached to its fraternal and strategic relationship with Pakistan. He conveyed Riyadh’s appreciation for the role Islamabad played in the OIC.

2,US-Pakistan talks to focus on regional security issues,US Under Secretary of Sta­te Uzra Zeya arrived in Islam­abad on Monday to attend the OIC Foreign Ministers Conference.,"

Uzra Zeya

 
WASHINGTON: The Uni­ted States and Pakistan will hold bilateral talks on Wedn­esday, focusing on regional security developments, Af­­ghanistan and Ukraine. 
US Under Secretary of Sta­te for Civilian Security, De­­m­ocracy and Human Rights Uzra Zeya arrived in Islam­abad on Monday to attend the OIC Foreign Ministers Conference, which began on Tuesday. 
Islamabad is holding the two-day conference, despite intense political instability triggered by a no-confidence move against the PTI government. Both opposition and ruling parties agreed to pause their protests and counter-protests for two days to allow OIC delegates to meet and disperse before the infighting resumes.
Under Secretary Zeya is representing the United Sta­tes at the conference, which is also attended by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Wi. 
In a statement issued on Monday evening, the US State Department said Under Secretary Zeya will lead the US delegation to the 48th session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers conference and meet senior government officials, as well as members of civil society and international organisations. 
During her OIC engagements, the under secretary “will highlight the deep and close ties between the United States and the OIC member states, underscore the need for humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan, and advocate for human rights and freedoms for all,” the statement added.
In her meetings with Pakistani officials, Ms Zeya “will address regional security developments, Pakistan’s generous hosting of Afghan refugees and support for Afghan relocation efforts”. 
The bilateral talks would also focus on “worldwide condemnation of Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine and celebrating the 75th anniversary of US-Pakistan diplomatic relations”, the State Department said.
A department spokesperson told Dawn on Monday that “a strong, prosperous and democratic” Pakistan was critical to US interests.
From Islamabad, Under Secretary Zeya travels to Tunis where she will meet senior government officials to discuss inclusive political and economic reforms, protecting human rights, and the integral role civil society plays in a strong democracy.
During her meetings, the under secretary will also discuss the economic challenges that Tunisia is facing because of the Russian invasion.
Under Secretary Zeya will then travel to Abu Dhabi and Dubai from March 27 to 29, where her talks would focus on efforts to advance Abraham Accords implementation and exchange views on advancing human rights, strengthening regional security, and ending the war in Yemen and Syria.

3,"Expertise, needs of courts should dictate judges’ elevation: CJP",Laments dearth of judges with expertise in civil law in Lahore High Court and criminal law in Sindh High Court.,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial has emphasised that while elevating judges to high courts, the presence of a “particular expertise” among them, coupled with needs of the courts to which they are to be appointed should be kept in mind.  
He made the observation during a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s Rules Committee which was held on March 9 and was also attended by Justice Maqbool Baqar, former Justice Sarmad Jalal Osmany, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan and Pakistan Bar Council representative Akhtar Hussain.  
During the meeting, Chief Justice Bandial highlighted the dearth of judges who had expertise in civil law in the Lahore High Court, adding that one of the two remaining experts on the bench would retire next year. A source said the chief justice also regretted that in the Sindh High Court, there was a dearth of judges having expertise in criminal law and that apart from a few of them, the rest all had expertise in corporate, constitutional or civil matters.  
In the Supreme Court, he emphasised, three vacancies of judges would soon accrue, one of them “actual” and two “anticipated” ones. Being the chairman of the commission he would ask for a number of nominations per vacancy and with sufficient feedback the commission’s members would hopefully make informed decisions.  
During the meeting Justice Osmany recalled the criteria evolved by the English for appointment of judges under which “a judge should be a gentleman first and a gentleman last and the rest will follow”. He/she should have the demeanour of a judge, which means they should possess the capacity to listen carefully to everyone and be polite to the lawyers.  
Justice Osmany said the judge should know the law of the land because they would not be able to implement it unless they knew it thoroughly, adding the first criterion should be integrity coupled with competence.  
As the demand for transparency was increasing, things should be put in writing, Justice Osmany suggested. He said that he does not agree with the proposal that there should be a written examination for judges as it was not a civil service appointment.  
Justice Baqar was of the view that focus of the meeting should be on how to evaluate and assess different qualities so that criteria could be devised to rank the candidates, including the methodology based on some objective measurement. The real question, he observed, was how to apply these criteria. He asked whether there should be just one nomination for each vacant post and should the nomination come from the chief justice or also from other members, including representatives of the bar.  
AGP Khan said if seniority was not an automatic criterion, “then certainly we need some criteria, and criteria could only exist in a comparative context. If there is only one name proposed, then it becomes very hard to compare, particularly when we are discussing appointments in the Supreme Court”, he said.

4,Greenhouse gas emissions likely to go up: ADB,"Says accurate emission estimates are needed and mitigation actions must be put in place to reduce emissions from waste sector,","ISLAMABAD: Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the waste sector in Pakistan are expected to increase substantially in the coming years, coupled with rapid population growth and urbanisation, while no mitigation actions have been suggested for the sector in the country’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) submitted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which the country signed in 1994, said a report of the Asian Development Bank made available on Tuesday. 
Under the Paris Agreement, each country is expected to outline and communicate its post-2020 climate actions in the form of an NDC. Pakistan submitted its NDC to the UNFCCC in 2015, which stated that Pakistan intended to reduce up to 20 per cent of its projected GHG emissions by 2030, subject to the availability of international grants to cover the total abatement cost. 
More accurate emission estimates are urgently needed and mitigation actions must be promptly put in place to reduce emissions from the waste sector, the report said. 
The latest year for which emission estimates have been compiled is 2015. A review of the second national communication (2NC) showed that 15.65 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent contributed by GHG emissions from the waste sector in 2014-2015, versus the 12.29m tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent reported for the same period. 
Currently available data suggest that the country generates around 28m tons of municipal waste annually, with at least a 50 per cent organic fraction. Very little biological treatment or disposal at engineered landfill sites is done. There is an urgent need to generate more accurate and segregated data to improve the accuracy of the waste emission estimates, the report suggests. 
Providing data at the national level requires data to be collected from more than 500 local councils, a challenging task in the light of the limited technical capacity available. However, various ongoing donor-funded projects in the urban sector could provide much useful information. 
The ministry of climate change is responsible for solid waste management in urban areas. At the provincial level, waste management is handled by local government departments. This responsibility in large cities has been delegated to public sector companies, following some institutional reforms over the last decade.

5,"Many Muslim leaders lack courage, but PM Imran has plenty: Asad Umar",Criticises opposition leaders for being unable to plead the case of Muslims at the international level.,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar suggested on Tuesday that many leaders of the Muslim world did not have the moral courage to fight for the rights of Muslims, but Prime Minister Imran Khan was different.  
He said that being a truthful, faithful, brave and confident leader, Mr Khan pleaded the Muslims’ case on Islamophobia at the international level very effectively, which compelled the UN to declare March 15 as the International Day Against Islamophobia.  
Mr Umar was talking to journalists after inaugurating a camp of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) members here in Sector I-10. The PTI camp Mr Umar inaugurated has been established in connection with the party’s public meeting at the Parade Ground scheduled for March 27. 
Criticising leaders of the opposition parties, the minister said they were unable to plead the Muslims’ case at the international level because their billions of rupees were stashed abroad. He said the submission of a no-confidence motion against the prime minister would serve to define the future of politics in the country. 
Mr Umar claimed that a dissident PTI member, Ahmed Hussain Dehar, had announced that he was returning to the ruling party. However, Mr Dehar said in a television programme that he was not going back to the party.  
When contacted, a federal minister said the government seemed to be in “real trouble” because many dissident party members might never return to it.
