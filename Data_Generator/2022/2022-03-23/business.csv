0,IMF asks for changes to personal income tax,Calls for reforms to raise maximum revenue.,"ISLAMABAD: At a time when the economy is grappling with political uncertainty, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reiterated its earlier demand asking Islamabad for changes in personal income tax (PIT).
A staff mission of the IMF held a first round of discussions with tax officials last week and raised the issue of reforms in the PIT to raise maximum revenue, especially from salary incomes.
Last year, the government did not accept the same demand of the Fund.
These demands are part of the seventh review of the $6 billion of the Fund Extended Fund Facility (EFF). In the wake of the sixth review, the government withdrew tax exemptions worth Rs343bn as against the IMF demand of Rs700bn.
A well-placed source told Dawn that as part of the reforms, the IMF has demanded to reduce the salary income tax slabs from the existing 12 to six with an increase in the rates. The demand is one of the conditions for consideration in the next budget.
As per one of the proposals the burden of tax payment would be decreased on lower-income ceiling earning Rs600,000 per annum, while tax incidence would be increased on those who are earning over Rs300,000 per month basis.

At the same time, it is also proposed to bring reforms in Provident Fund and other allowances for taxation.
Pakistan has already held out an assurance to the Fund to make legislation about PIT before the budget to ensure that it will be ready to come into effect from July 1.
The broader contours of the reforms are at simplifying the system, increasing progressivity, and supporting labor formalization.
This will reduce both the number of rates and income tax brackets; reduce tax credits and allowances (except those for disabled and senior citizens, and Zakat receipts); introduce special tax procedures for very small taxpayers; and bring additional taxpayers into the tax net.
Moreover, the low-income households will remain protected. The IMF estimates that these PIT reforms will yield an estimated 0.3 per cent of GDP in revenue gains in FY2024.
According to the source, the government has already committed to making the legislation by the end of February 2022. “We are committed to reforming our PIT,” the source said, adding the reforms include changing the existing tax rate structure by reducing the number of rates and income tax brackets (slabs) to simplify the PIT system and increase progress. It will also reduce tax expenditures and allowances.

1,"World Bank indirectly funding Pakistan coal projects, says analyst","“The World Bank’s assistance led to a surge in coal investments and over 7,000 megawatts of coal-fired power in Pakistan"": analyst","KARACHI: The World Bank has been actively funding coal projects in Pakistan despite making a global no-coal-finance pledge back in 2013, said analysts at a seminar on Tuesday organised by the Alliance for Climate Justice and Clean Energy, a coalition of energy-sector think tanks.
“The World Bank’s assistance led to a surge in coal investments and over 7,000 megawatts of coal-fired power in Pakistan... its rhetoric on coal is different from reality,” said Heike Mainhardt, senior adviser at Urgewald, a Germany-based non-profit organisation.
She said the World Bank may’ve stopped “direct project finance” of coal projects, but it continues to assist Pakistan in following the coal road map without labelling it as such.
As an example of indirect coal funding, she referred to “on-lending through financial intermediaries” that involves the bank making more capital available through commercial banks and equity funds for coal projects.
Other ways of indirect coal funding include direct public finance of enabling infrastructure, on-lending through government budget support, favourable policy reforms like tax breaks and technical assistance in the form of data gathering and feasibility studies.
At least six Thar coal-to-power projects, involving mining and 3,240MW coal-fired power generation, reached financial closure between 2016 and 2020. The World Bank’s post-2013 assistance is linked to each of the six projects, she said.
The World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) invested $75 million in equity and provided a $150m loan to Habib Bank Ltd in April 2015. The Pakistani lender subsequently either invested equity in or provided debt finance to five Thar coal-to-power projects, she said.
Similarly, the IFC invested $66m in equity in Bank Alfalah Ltd in December 2014, which subsequently provided debt financing to at least two of the Thar projects, she added.
She said the bank’s tariff policy reforms made new coal power investments in Pakistan the most profitable worldwide. “As a result, Pakistan is tied to very high capacity payments for coal power, leading to high subsidies and consumer tariffs,” she said.
Speaking on the occasion, Alternative Law Collective Director Research Zain Moulvi said the World Bank’s tacit support of Thar coal demonstrates the complex mechanisms through which it can instigate crises in Pakistan’s energy sector.
“The Thar coal projects will significantly raise electricity tariffs and have already caused massive displacement and loss of livelihoods in Thar. They’re further projected to cause up to 29,000 air pollution-related deaths,” he said.

2,No major impact likely if Russia defaults: IMF,"“If there were a default, I think the direct effect on the rest of the world would be quite limited,"" says IMF official.","WASHINGTON: The consequences for the global financial system if Russia cannot pay its foreign debts are likely to be  “limited,” a senior IMF official said on Tuesday.
The United States and its allies have imposed tough financial sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, but Moscow so far has made debt payments.
Still, concerns remain about its ability to continue to service its loans — especially after the May 25 expiration of a US exemption that allows the transactions.
“If there were a default, I think the direct effect on the rest of the world would be quite limited, because the numbers that we’re looking at are relatively small from a global perspective,” said Gita Gopinath, the number-two official at the Washington-based crisis lender.
“It is not a systemic risk to the global economy,” although some banks have  “greater exposure,” she said in a discussion with Foreign Policy magazine.
The sanctions effectively have severed Russia’s ties to the global financial system, prohibiting most transactions except for debt payments and oil purchases.
The measures also froze the government’s stockpile of $300 billion in foreign currency reserves held abroad.
Moscow last week avoided default after it made a $117 million interest payment on two dollar-denominated bonds, sending funds through JPMorgan and Citigroup, which confirmed with the US Treasury Department that the transactions were allowed.
Moscow had initially indicated that it would make the payments in rubles, which debt ratings agencies said would be considered a default. However, some obligations allow payment in the local currency.
A source close to the matter told AFP on Tuesday that JPMorgan received another $66 million payment in US dollars, although the source could not confirm if the funds had yet been sent to Citi.

3,ADB approves $300m for capital market reforms,ADB programme aims to catalyse institutional investor demand and increase the range of alternative financial instruments.,"ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Tuesday approved a $300 million loan as budgetary support to Pakistan for the development of the capital market, promotion of private investment and help mobilise resources to finance sustainable economic growth.
The second subprogramme of ADB’s Third Capital Market Development Programme builds on institutional and regulatory reforms under the first subprogramme approved in 2020.
It aims to catalyse institutional investor demand and increase the range of alternative financial instruments such as derivatives and commodity futures that are available to investors.
“For several years ADB has been Pakistan’s lead development partner in supporting the evolution of its capital markets,” said ADB Director General for Central and West Asia Yevgeniy Zhukov.
“By making the country’s capital markets more robust and strengthening government debt management, this new programme will also help to mobilise more domestic resources which support the government’s efforts to finance sustainable growth and respond effectively to crises.”
Pakistan’s finance sector is dominated by banks and this lack of diversification increases the risk of the country not being able to withstand financial shocks and periods of uncertainty. 
Moreover, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) lacks depth in terms of the number of investors which access it and the number of companies raising capital, while Pakistan’s bond market is almost completely dominated by government borrowing.
ADB’s programme supports policy actions that will strengthen market stability and attract investor capital to Pakistan.
These include structural reforms within the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) that will improve governance and regulatory capacity, strengthen the government debt market and enhance market surveillance systems that facilitate information exchange. 
The programme also promotes an enabling environment to expedite access to financing for growth companies and state-owned enterprises.
“These reforms will help to mobilise financial resources for productive investment, especially by the private sector, and help facilitate economic growth by developing the bond and equity capital markets,” said ADB Economist Sana Masood.
“This will help reduce the cost of financial intermediation and help stabilize systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated finance system.”
The concept of the Third Capital Market Development Programme (CMD) (Subprogramme-1) was cleared by the concept clearance committee in May 2020 as a loan from the ADB for budgetary support to enable the government to finance Covid-19 related expenditure.
The loan amount of $300 million under subprogramme-1 has already been disbursed.

4,Dollar surges to new peak,Analysts say demand for dollars is high because of the upturn in oil and other commodity prices in the international market.,"KARACHI: The rupee sank to yet another record low against the dollar on Tuesday as it closed at 181.73, down 0.26 per cent from a day ago.
According to Arif Habib Ltd Head of Research Tahir Abbas, the rupee has lost as much as 2.87pc since the beginning of 2022.
Analysts say demand for dollars is high because of the upturn in oil and other commodity prices in the international market. The political crisis is also adding to the pressure on the local currency.
The rupee is down 13.31pc since the beginning of 2021-22. It has shed 16.21pc value since its most recent high on May 14.
A day earlier, the rupee lost 0.38pc against the dollar in the inter-bank market amidst the opposition’s yet another attempt at ousting the prime minister.
Currency dealers said the State Bank of Pakistan made an intervention on Monday to arrest the slide of the rupee on the week’s first day.
Despite a significantly low current account deficit of $0.5 billion in February (versus $2.5bn in January), demand for the greenback was still high owing to unusually high commodity prices.
“The oil prices have come down from the peak and are now hovering above $116 per barrel but they are still very high compared to rates available six months before,” said a open market trader.

5,"SECP removes over 3,000 inactive companies","“This is the first time the we have removed such a significant number of inactive companies from our register,” SECP says.","ISLAMABAD: The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) deleted more than 3,000 inactive companies from its books between December 2018 to December 2021 to streamline the working of registered companies, the regulator said on Tuesday.
Responding to a query posted by the Ministry of Finance, the SECP said the number of incorporations increased significantly in the past three years.
“There were 95,621 registered companies in Pakistan by December 2018, which reached 158,537 at the end of December 2021, indicating a growth of 67 per cent,” the regulator said. 
“This is the first time the SECP removed such a significant number of inactive companies from its register,” the commission said.
The number of registered companies is on the rise following the ease of doing business introduced by the SECP. This also gives flexibility to the regulator to strike-off inactive companies from its books, the commission maintained.
The SECP said the government’s pro-real estate policies gave impetus for newer businesses to start and expand. The policies geared towards improving ease of doing business and investor confidence also proved beneficial for the corporate industry, it added.
