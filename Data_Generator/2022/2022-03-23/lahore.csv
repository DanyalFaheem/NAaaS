0,12 held in aftermath of vendor’s ‘lynching’ in Kasur,Victim’s brother cries out against wedding guests’ callousness.,"KASUR: Police claimed on Tuesday to have arrested 12 suspects a day after a rice cracker vendor was allegedly tortured to death by some wedding guests at Pattoki. 
Police teams arrested the suspects in Chunian and  its adjoining areas such as Allahabad, Kanganpur and Sara-i-Mughal on the basis of video clips of social media and evidence taken from CCTV cameras and the moviemaker. 
Meanwhile, vendor Muhammad Ashraf alias Sultan was laid to rest at Jagowala village. No official or public representative attended the funeral despite public rage over the callousness of wedding participants who went about having their dinner in utter disregard for the tragedy.  
Police also claimed to have recovered the CCTV footage  from the cameras which were removed soon after the incident to  avoid legal formalities.  

Victim’s brother cries out against wedding guests’ callousness

Hall owner Muhammad Waqar also has been  arrested.  
Police denied torture of the vendor in the light of a preliminary medical report. 
District Police Officer Sohaib Ashraf said it would be premature to say anything before the forensic report and added that the samples collected from the crime scene had been sent to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) for chemical analysis. 
On Monday, a mob of wedding guests allegedly tortured 50-year-old vendor Muhammad Ashraf to death after a quarrel with him over a trifle at a banquet hall at Pattoki’s Kohna Road, hardly seven kilometres from the city police station. 
Initially, the social media reported that a mob had tortured to death an unidentified vendor suspecting him to be a pickpocket. The body remained at the hall for over half an hour and was later identified as that of Ashraf who belonged to Jagowala Chak 4. 
Police shifted the body to the THQ hospital and registered a case against six unidentified suspects (all wedding guests) on the report of Muhammad Parvez, brother-in-law of the victim. The complainant in the FIR claimed that he and two others were eyewitnesses and they implored the mob to spare the man.  
The video which went viral on social media showed the body lying on the floor with no attendant as the wedding guests were taking food without having any qualms about ignoring the tragic incident.  
The brother of the victim, as shown in another video clip, expressed  his concern over the callousness of the people around and also criticised police for being clueless about the killers.  
Chief Minister Usman Buzdar had taken notice of the incident and sought a report from the IGP.

4,PM Imran be held accountable for ‘witch-hunt’ of Nawaz: Maryam,Says the apology of Broadsheet's CEO to Nawaz Sharif for corruption allegations is a charge sheet against the prime minister.,"LAHORE: PML-N Vice-President Maryam Nawaz has demanded accountability of Prime Minister Imran Khan for spending £65 million from the national kitty for the ‘witch-hunt’ of Nawaz Sharif.  
“Imran Khan will have to answer who authorised him to spend the people’s money to settle his personal vendetta against Nawaz Sharif. He spent £65 million but could not prove Rs65 corruption against Sharif,” Ms Nawaz said in a tweet on Tuesday.



 
She further said the former premier got vindicated after the broadsheet case. “Moussavi’s apology is a charge sheet on Imran Khan,” she declared. 
Kaveh Moussavi, CEO of asset recovery firm Broadsheet, has issued an apology to Nawaz Sharif for allegations of corruption.
“We found a lot of plundered wealth (linked to others), but I can categorically state after virtually 21 years of investigation that not one rupee was related to Nawaz Sharif or any member of his family. If anyone says otherwise they are lying. I have no hesitation in issuing an apology to the former prime minister for my being party to a scam and scandalous nonsense masquerading as the National Accountability Bureau,” Moussavi said and added that NAB was a fraud through and through and Mr Sharif was the victim of a scandalous witch-hunt.
The Sharif family had secured the payment of £20,000 (Rs4.5 million) in litigation costs last year from the firm after it was unsuccessful in its attempts to lay a claim on Avenfield apartments.
The PML-N said the revelations and apology made by Moussavi had not only vindicated the elder Sharif and family but also dealt a “resounding smack on the face of Imran Niazi and his politically inspired witch-hunt in the name of so-called accountability.”

5,"Punjab cabinet okays Rs8bn Ramzan package, wheat policy",Marathon meeting reviews political situation; decides to hand over four schools to Presbyterian Church.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government held a five-hour long provincial cabinet meeting with nine-point agenda at chief minister’s secretariat late on Monday and approved Rs8 billion Ramzan package and wheat procurement policy.
The 52nd meeting also discussed the political situation in the wake of no-confidence motion at the Centre and ‘disgruntled’ factions, particularly the Jahangir Tareen group, within the party. The Tareen group has the support of two ministers and four advisers.
The group had already boycotted the provincial cabinet meeting taking a plea that its members would not attend any meeting chaired by Chief Minister Buzdar since it was demanding removal of the CM.  
According to the Ramzan package, the 10kg flour bag would be sold at Rs450 in Ramzan bazaars as the government would provide around Rs4bn subsidy under this head. Similarly, 13 food items would be provided at the rates of the previous year in Ramzan bazaars. The one kg sugar bag would be sold for Rs10 less than the market price. Similarly, chicken would be available at Rs10 less per kg and eggs at Rs5 per dozen less.

Marathon meeting reviews political situation; decides to hand over four schools to Presbyterian Church

The province would set up 317 Ramzan bazaars - 30 in Lahore, 19 in Faisalabad, 16 each in Rawalpindi and Gujranwala and 12 each in Kasur and Bahawalpur - from last week of Sha’aban where agri-fair price shops would also be established to provide eatables at affordable rates. These bazaars would serve as Eid bazaars after Ramzan 20.  
The cabinet also approved wheat procurement policy 2022-23 to purchase 3.5 million tonnes grain at the rate of Rs2,200 per maund. The procurement target would be enhanced, if needed, and the meeting further decided to effectively curtail the illegal movement of the commodity. An eight-member provincial level committee was also formulated to procure wheat. The monitoring committees would monitor the procurement process at different levels. Temporary staff would also be hired for the purpose.
The cabinet decided to hand over the administration of four nationalised missionary schools, which were nationalised in 1973, to the US Presbyterian Church and approved the act for new universities to be set up in Attock, Toba Tek Singh, Rajanpur, Hafizabad, Pakpattan, Gujranwala, Taunsa, Kamalia, Layyah and Dera Ghazi Khan. The new universities can only set up sub-campuses in their respective districts only.  
It also approved a new search committee, comprising Rector NUST retired Lt-Gen Javed Mahmood Bukhari, Prof. Akmal Hussain, Syed Tahir Shahbaz, Chairperson PHEC and secretary higher education department, for posting of VC of Punjab University.
Sources say the higher education department had also proposed the name of Akhuwat CEO Dr Amjad Saqib but Usman Buzdar got it removed. They claim that the higher education department would, however, notify the new committee after intelligence reports [about the members] from agencies.
The Punjab higher education department had prepared and finalised a Model University Act for all the new universities in the province and presented it to the cabinet. However, the chief minister’s office instructed the higher education department to withdraw the agenda for the time being.  
“The proposed Model University Act for the new universities was withdrawn on the instructions of the chief minister’s office and now the cabinet approved the existing Act that govern public sector universities,” a cabinet member told Dawn.  
The member said the Model University Act would be implemented for the new universities at some later stage.  
It approved to construct a graduate girls college over 34 kanal land in Sikandria Colony in Lahore along with the approval of 15,000 acres Cholistan land for military schedule. Conditional approval of a settlement between PSCA and Huawei was granted as the company would conduct upkeep of CCTVs for two years.
The proceedings of the 80th to 84th meetings of the cabinet standing committee for the legislation were also endorsed.

The protesters blocked the Lower Mall on both sides and chanted slogans against the bureaucracy and government for delaying acceptance of their demands including pay and service protection of 7,000 teachers.  
The protesters said they boycotted the classes in all colleges of the province from 10am to 11am daily due to the attitude of the government. “They will be forced to observe a complete boycott if the government continues to avoid their protest and sit-in and fails to accept their demands,” they said. 
They said around 7,000 college teachers were affected by the policies of the government and they were facing a Rs20,000 pay cut on a monthly basis. They said 6,500 college teachers recruited in 2002, 2005, 2009 and 2012 and 500 commerce college teachers had been facing financial hardships due to cut in salaries.

The college teachers said the government had accepted their demands in 2019 and the teachers had ended their sit-in. A summary was prepared to address the issue but it was not forwarded to the chief minister, they added.

He said the agriculture subject gained importance in order to feed the ever-growing population that may touch 10 billion by the end of this century.  
Pakistan has a great potential to promote its agriculture due to its huge fertile lands, etc. He said the Netherland was one fifth of Punjab but it was the one of the top food exporters due to the latest agriculture tools, practices and research. 
He said the Netherlands horticulture sector had its own the best recognition across the world. 
He said that education in the Netherlands is affordable to Pakistani students and they should get benefit from it. 
UAF VC Prof Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan said we have to lower down dependency on wheat and need to bring food diversification. He said food security was the area of concern for the people and the strengthened ties with the Netherlands in the area of agriculture would bring tangible results.  
He said there was a need to learn from the Dutch experiences. He said the potato project was focusing on women farmers also. He said that the county can earn the heavy forex by potatoes. Potatoes are also being used as the staple food in any country.
