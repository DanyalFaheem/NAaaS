The 32-year-old all-rounder suffered the injury during his team’s seven-wicket win on Sunday which levelled the three-match series at 1-1.
South Africa have also released Ryan Rickelton from the ODI squad to play in domestic competition this week before he joins the Test squad over the weekend, officials added.
Bangladesh stalwart Shakib Al Hassan has decided to play in the deciding ODI despite his mother and two of his children being in hospital with unspecified illness.
He had initially planned to returned home on Monday but team officials said on Tuesday he had changed his mind and would play the final match of the limited over series, but then likely return home and miss the two Test series

FIFA outlined the procedure on Tuesday for the draw in Qatar on April 1. Only 29 of the 32 teams in the draw will be known by then because of the war and global health crisis.
The three remaining places will be decided in June, one from Europe in matches involving Ukraine and the others from the intercontinental playoffs.
At the draw in Doha, the 29 qualified teams will be put into four pots according to their FIFA ranking, which is based on national team results and will be updated the day before the draw.
Hosts Qatar are in Pot 1 along with defending champion France, Belgium, Brazil, Argentina, England and Spain. The final top-seeded team will likely be either Italy or Portugal, who are in the same playoff bracket.
Germany, the 2014 World Cup champions, have been ranked outside the top 10 for more than three years and will be in Pot 2.
FIFA resolved the uncertainty around how to seed the three undecided entries by creating placeholder spots in Pot 4. The teams affected could land in a tougher World Cup group than their ranking merits simply because they could not complete their games as originally scheduled.
Besides Ukraine, Wales and Colombia are among the teams that could be affected. Each of the three, if they were to qualify, would likely have been in Pot 3.
Only 15 teams have so far qualified for the World Cup ahead of more games around the world over the next week.
Ukraine were scheduled to play at Scotland on Thursday with the winners advancing to play either Wales or Austria on March 29. Ukraine asked for a postponement because it was not possible for home-based players to train and travel during the Russian invasion.
The pandemic also created a backlog of games, wiping out nearly all national team football outside Europe in 2020 and causing the intercontinental playoffs to be delayed.
Those playoffs are scheduled to be played in Qatar on June 13-14. An Asian team will play a South American team, and the Oceania representative will play a team from the North American region.
World Cup draws are balanced to separate teams from the same continent. The 13 European nations will be allocated so that none of the eight groups has more than two teams from that continent.
The World Cup is scheduled to be played from Nov 21-Dec 18 in eight stadiums around the Qatari capital of Doha.
The host nation are currently ranked 52nd, the lowest of the teams already qualified. That is higher than 2018 hosts Russia, who were ranked 65th when the groups were drawn four years ago.
FIFA removed Russia from the qualifying playoffs this month as punishment for invading Ukraine.

3,Nadal out for up to six weeks with stress fracture in rib,"“I’m disappointed and sad because after a good start to the season I was coming to a very important part of the year,"" says Nadal.","MADRID: Rafael Nadal has suffered a stress fracture in his rib and will be out for up to six weeks, putting in jeopardy his preparations for the French Open in two months. 
Nadal, the winner of 21 Grand Slam singles titles, complained of a chest issue during his run to the final of the ATP 1000 event in Indian Wells, California last week. 
Upon his arrival in Spain on Tuesday, Nadal visited his medical team in Barcelona for tests which revealed “a stress fracture of the third left costal arch”. 
“This is not good news and I did not expect this,” Nadal wrote on Twitter. “I’m disappointed and sad because after a good start to the season I was coming to a very important part of the year with very good feelings and good results. 



 
“I have always had that spirit of fighting and ....I will... work hard [for] my recovery.” 
Nadal’s injury occurred during his three-set semi-final victory over teenaged compatriot Carlos Alcaraz but he still played the final in which he went down to American Taylor Fritz — his first loss in the season after 20 consecutive wins. 
His doctor said that the 35-year-old will be out of action for “four to six weeks”, ruling him out of next month’s Monte Carlo Masters and putting doubts over his participation in the ATP 1000 events in Madrid and Rome in May. 
The French Open, the year’s second major at Roland Garros where Nadal has won a record 13 titles, is scheduled to start from May 22. 
Nadal started the 2022 season unprepared and with uncertainty looming over him due to a foot problem that forced him to miss a chunk of the 2021 season including Wimbledon, the Olympics and the US Open. 
After suffering a bout of Covid-19 before arriving in Melbourne in January, Nadal said he had even considered retiring when the foot problem that has troubled him throughout his career resurfaced last year. 
But that did not stop the left-hander from winning three consecutive titles in 2022, including the Australian Open that helped him to increase his major haul to 21 and take sole ownership of the men’s record he had previously shared with Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer.

The Newcastle United striker nodded in a header on the cusp of half-time to draw level with Vaughan Coveny on 29 goals, then curled in a shot in the 73rd minute to claim the record outright.“It means a lot. Its been sought after for a very long time, said 30-year-old Wood. “I dreamed as a kid trying to get to it, so to break it is fantastic and hopefully I can add a few more goals across the course of my career.”
Wood may not have too long before boosting his tally, with New Zealand to play world number 153 New Caledonia in their third and final Group ‘B’ game on Thursday.
Wood scored his first international goal as an 18-year-old in a 1-1 draw with Honduras in 2010.
New Zealand, easily the strongest soccer nation in the Oceania region, beat Papua New Guinea 1-0 in their opener on Friday.
The top two teams of the tournament’s two groups advance to semi-finals on Sunday before the March 30 final.
The winner advances to an intercontinental playoff against the fourth-placed side from the CONCACAF region, which features nations from North and Central America, and the Caribbean.
New Zealand were the last Oceania team to qualify for the World Cup when they made the 2010 finals in South Africa.

Uncapped defender Kyle Rowles has also been ruled out of the qualifiers after testing positive for COVID-19, Football Australia said on Tuesday.
Coach Graham Arnold has drafted in Sydney FC captain Alex Wilkinson to provide defensive cover for the Japan clash in Sydney on Thursday, while Kuwait-based defender Ryan McGowan will link up with Australia in the Middle East for the Saudi match on March 29.
Positive Covid-19 tests have already ruled out midfielders Aaron Mooy and Jackson Irvine, and winger Craig Goodwin.
Arnold is also isolating after testing positive last Thursday. He was fined A$25,000 ($18,455) on Monday for breaching mandatory isolation rules.
The ‘Socceroos’ will likely need to beat both Japan and Saudi Arabia to ensure automatic qualification for this year’s World Cup in Qatar.
Arnold’s side are third in Group B, three points adrift of second-placed Japan while leaders Saudi Arabia are a further point ahead.

6,Dutch cricket ventures to a new frontier in maiden New Zealand voyage,"AMSTERDAM: Although nearly four centuries have passed since Dutch explorer Abel Tasman discovered New Zealand, his...","AMSTERDAM: Although nearly four centuries have passed since Dutch explorer Abel Tasman discovered New Zealand, his adventurous spirit lives on in a new generation of pioneers from the Netherlands — only this time they are traveling for a game of cricket.
For the first time, New Zealand will host a team from beyond the elite world of test-playing nations for an international tour, arranging a one-off Twenty20 with the Dutch on Friday and three one-day internationals between March 29 and April 4.
“This opportunity is arguably once in a lifetime,” Netherlands captain Pieter Seelaar, told Reuters.
“I’ve been playing (since 2005) and never even experienced anything that remotely resembles something like this.”  World championship events run by the International Cricket Council are usually the only occasions when minnow teams like the Netherlands receive high-level exposure.
Their engagement by New Zealand marks the first time a country in cricket’s Anglosphere has hosted a second-tier team for a multi-format tour.
Among the game’s other long-established territories, only the West Indies have similarly extended tours for developing sides before, hosting Ireland (2014) and Afghanistan (2017) across white-ball formats before they attained full test status.
“There’s no incentive for full members to get associates over and play a series against them,” Seelaar said, lamenting the ICC’s decision last year to end the home-and-away ODI Super League after the current cycle.
His side is the only non-test nation in the 13-team competition.
“I think our younger players in the squad don’t quite realise how special it is that they’re going to be part of this series.
“To combat New Zealand in their own conditions, it doesn’t get any better as a cricketer does it?”
The Dutch, who have made four appearances in both the ODI and T20 World Cups, achieved their greatest success in the shortest format when they humiliated England at Lord’s in 2009 — and again five years later in Chittagong.
Despite cricket not being popular locally, the Netherlands have continually developed homegrown talent and cannily enticed foreign players to bolster their lineup.
“We improved a lot as cricketers because we got to play on the county grounds, on the professional surfaces, and have access to incredible facilities,” Seelaar said.
“In the Netherlands, we have five or six guys under contract, on a very modest salary,” the left-arm spinner said.
“(Most players) still have to earn money outside of the professional game playing for Holland, so they either have to coach or actually have an office job on the side.”  New Zealand have assembled a strong squad for retiring batsman Ross Taylor’s swansong, but will miss some white-ball regulars due to lucrative Indian Premier League commitments.
The juxtaposition is evident to Seelaar, who acknowledges that high-profile opportunities for his men can offer both exposure and distraction.
“These days, where there’s T20 leagues everywhere around the world, doing well at perfectly the right time could get you a deal very quickly,” he said.
“It would be on some players’ minds, which I would prefer it not to be”.

7,"Final Test evenly poised after Shaheen, Naseem break Australia’s resistance","“We have got a good start to our batting, so we need to take the total to 450-500 and then bowl our team to success,” says Shaheen","LAHORE: With three more days to play, Pakistan trailing by 301 runs and Azhar Ali and Abdullah Shafique looking to build on their unbeaten 70-run stand, the series-deciding third and final Test against Australia here at the Gaddafi Stadium looks evenly poised.
Pacers Naseem Shah and Shaheen Shah Afridi completed four-wicket hauls on Tuesday but Australia still managed to post 391 in their first innings thanks to a 135-run sixth-wicket stand between Cameron Green (79) and Alex Carey (67). Pakistan lost opener Imam-ul-Haq early on but Abdullah (45) and Azhar (30) ensured they ended the day without any further damage.
“We have got a good start to our batting, so we need to take the total to 450-500 and then bowl our team to success,” Shaheen, who termed the pitch conducive for batting, told an online news conference. 
Having wrapped up the Australian innings with a searing yorker that dismantled Mitchell Swepson’s stumps after lunch to finish with 4-79, Shaheen added Pakistan had to be patient in their search for wickets.

“You have to be patient on such wickets where you have to wait for the ball to get old for reverse swing and get results,” he said. “You have to give them [Green and Carey] credit for batting very well in the first session, but that’s the beauty of Test cricket, you win some sessions, you lose some. We tried to bowl the right areas and in partnership so after they had a good stand we got the breakthrough and got success.”
Having resumed at 232-5, Green and Carey had frustrated Pakistan in the first session before left-arm spinner Nauman Ali got the breakthrough the hosts so wanted. Trying to play across the line, having hit seven boundaries, Carey was hit on the front pad and was adjudged lbw in the fourth over after lunch.
Green followed soon after, with Naseem (4-58) cleaning him up with a fizzing delivery that went through his bat and pad and onto off-stump. 
“Naseem bowled really well all day,” Green said during an online news conference, “he was getting the ball to reverse pretty largely both ways.
“Unfortunately just a lack of concentration by me when you’ve been batting out there for a while. I thought I saw the ball go away from me but it came back in. That’s kind of what you face over here.”
Once Green departed Australian didn’t resist as Shaheen got Mitchell Starc and Naseem cleaned up Australian skipper Pat Cummins in quick successions before Shaheen dealt the last blow to the visitors.
Pakistan’s innings started slow with openers Abdullah and Imam adding only 20 in 12 overs together before the latter was trapped lbw by Cummins. The right-armer could have struck earlier as well when he squared up Abdullah to find a thick outside edge only to see the ball evade Green at third slip closely. 
Abdullah opened up 16 overs into the innings when he drove Cummins down the ground exquisitely but survived another chance in the same over as the ball flew past Carey and Steve Smith at first slip off the right-handers edge with Azhar on the other end.
Azhar announced his arrival as he came down the pitch to hit a towering six off Nathan Lyon before surviving a stumping chance off Swepson before Abdullah took on the leg-spinner to loft him through the covers.
There weren’t many occasions, though, where the duo went after the Australian bowlers as Azhar and Abdullah scored only 16 runs in the last ten overs of the day.
Earlier, Carey and Green looked dominant as they added 88 runs to their overnight score helping Australia to 320-5 by lunch. 
Pakistan thought they had made the breakthrough when umpire Aleem Dar gave Carey caught behind off pacer Hasan Ali but the left-hander reviewed straight away and the replay showed that he missed the ball which had also not carried to his Pakistan counterpart Mohammad Rizwan. 
Carey made the most of the reprieve by hitting spinner Sajid Khan for two fours before reaching his third Test fifty off just 73 balls. Green, on the other hand was slower, bringing up his half-century off 117 deliveries.
The pairing was eventually broken when Nauman struck as Australia ended up losing their last five wickets for only 71 runs.

8,Aussie pacer Richardson out of Pakistan white-ball series,Richardson’s injury in training and subsequent withdrawal means that Jason Behrendorff will lead the charge for Australia.,"MELBOURNE: Australia pace bowler Kane Richardson has been ruled out of their limited-overs tour of Pakistan due to a hamstring injury and will be replaced by the uncapped Ben Dwarshuis, Cricket Australia said on Tuesday.
Left-armer Dwarshuis joins a squad that is also missing pacemen Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins, who are set to return home following the ongoing third and final Test in Lahore.
Australia, who are on their first trip to Pakistan since 1998, are scheduled to play three One-day Internationals and one Twenty20 match against the hosts in Lahore from March 29 to April 5.
Richardson’s injury in training and subsequent withdrawal means that Jason Behrendorff will lead the charge for Australia and will be supported by the likes of Sean Abbott, Nathan Ellis and Dwarshuis.
“One thing that will help is the guys have played a lot of T20 cricket,” limited-overs skipper Aaron Finch said of his pace bowlers ahead of their departure for Pakistan.
“They’re quite inexperienced for Australia but playing T20 cricket will help them in that regard. There’s a lot of skill in the group and guys that have been around one-day cricket for a long time domestically as well.
“Having a lot of a lot of faith in their own ability is really important. When you have got guys like Abbott, he’s been around (international cricket) for a long time, Behrendorff — they’ve played a lot of state cricket, so it’ll be fine.”

Details about the exact nature of Roy’s disciplinary breach were not disclosed by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB).
The ECB said Roy admitted to a charge of conducting himself in a manner which may be prejudicial to the interests of cricket or which may bring the game of cricket, the ECB and himself into disrepute.
“His ban is for the next two England matches for which he is eligible for selection but it is suspended for 12 months, dependent on good behavior,” the ECB said.
The 31-year-old Roy was also fined 2,500 pounds ($3,310).
Roy, who played a key role in helping England win the 50-over 2019 World Cup, is expected to be in England’s squad for the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia this year.
He recently announced he was taking a short indefinite break from cricket after withdrawing from the upcoming Indian Premier League, citing bubble fatigue. He was due to play for Gujarat Titans.

11,PCB dedicates second day of Lahore Test to Pakistan’s fight against polio,"“Together, we can bowl out polio by focusing more on awareness-raising and promoting a culture of vaccine acceptance.” says PCB.","ISLAMABAD: While the country has not reported any polio case for around 15 months, the Pakistan Cricket Board ramped up support for polio eradication by dedicating the second day of the Lahore Test against Australia to raising awareness against the virus.
Under its Corporate Social Responsibility partnership with the Polio Programme, the PCB facilitated various awareness-raising activities, including a shout-out by the players, promoting awareness messages, honouring polio workers and polio survivors and ensuring their free access to the match.
“Cricketers, as national heroes are role models for the children and youth of Pakistan,” Dr Shahzad Baig, Coordinator of the National Emergency Operations Centre for Polio Eradication, said in a statement.

 





 
“I am so pleased and proud they are supporting the national mission of polio eradication and hope that their messages will reach some of the country’s hard to reach areas. I believe our work together with the PCB will help to reach parents and caregivers with an important message on vaccination. No child should ever be paralysed by Polio because it is a disease that can easily be prevented by a very safe vaccine.” he added.
PCB chairman Ramiz Raja assured full support of the country’s cricket governing body including the Pakistan players and officials to the Polio Programme.
“The PCB is committed to play its role,” Ramiz said. “Together, we can bowl out polio by focusing more on awareness-raising and promoting a culture of vaccine acceptance.”
While acknowledging the contributions of polio workers he added: “The entire Nation is proud of all polio workers for their commitment and hard work despite challenges in reaching every child across Pakistan.”
Pakistan recently marked a significant milestone with no wild polio case reported in the last 14 months, though the virus is still present in some parts of the country, and therefore it is a threat to all children in Pakistan.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only two countries left with the polio virus; and there is still an imminent risk of the polio virus to any unvaccinated child on either side of the border.

12,India boost Women's World Cup semi-final hopes as Australia crush South Africa,"With Australia already through to the semi-finals, SA had more to play for as a win would have sealed a spot in the top four.","HAMILTON: India boosted their Women’s Cricket World Cup semi-final prospects with a crushing 110-run win over Bangladesh on Tuesday, as a century from Australia captain Meg Lanning powered the tournament favourites to a five-wicket victory over South Africa.
India set Bangladesh a target of 230 in Hamilton and then skittled them for 119 in 40.3 overs to keep alive their playoff hopes.
In Tuesday’s other match, in Wellington, Lanning smashed an unbeaten 135 as Australia cruised past South Africa’s 271-5.
It leaves previously unbeaten South Africa in a scrap for the three other semi-final berths with India, the West Indies and England. Australia were already into the last four.
India chose to bat and appeared to be cruising at 74 without loss in the 15th over when Smriti Mandhana was dismissed for 30.
It sparked a mini-collapse which saw India lose two wickets in successive balls without adding to the score as Shafali Verma was stumped on 42 and Mithali Raj caught for a first-ball duck.
India entered the last 10 overs at 165-5 and their scoring momentum appeared to have stalled when Yastika Bhatia was dismissed for 50.
But Pooja Vastrakar and Sneh Rana came together for a useful 48-run stand that helped give India’s bowlers a respectable total to defend.
Bangladesh’s run chase never ignited in the face of tight bowling from India highlighted by four wickets for 30 from Rana.
There was some middle-order resistance from Salma Khatun, who made 32, and Lata Mondal, 24, but they never looked like reeling in India’s target.
The match between Australia and South Africa brought together the only two undefeated teams at this year’s tournament.
With Australia already through to the semi-finals, South Africa had more to play for as a win would have sealed a spot in the top four.
They set a solid target of 272 off the back of 90 from Laura Woolvardt but Australia’s formidable batting line-up easily overhauled the target with 28 balls to spare.
“We had a great first innings and 270 was par, on another day the bowling attack would have defended it,” said South Africa captain Sune Luus.
“We just lost it a bit on the field and probably lost a bit of focus... it won’t happen again.” Australia put South Africa in to bat after winning the toss but struggled to make early inroads as Woolvardt and Lizelle Lee put on an 88-run opening partnership.
Woolvardt notched her fourth consecutive half-century at the tournament, supported by Luus’s run-a-ball 52 and Marizanne Kapp’s 30 off 21 balls.
Australia’s openers departed cheaply but skipper Lanning stepped up to guide the six-time champions to 146-3 after 25 overs.
“It sort of became clear to me that I had to bat through after we lost a couple of early wickets,” she said.
It was Lanning’s 15th ODI century and came of 92 balls, including 13 fours and one six.
Tahlia McGrath was Australia’s next best batter on 32, with Lanning’s teammates content to play cameo roles.
Summarised scores:
SOUTH AFRICA 271-5 in 50 overs (L. Woolvardt 90, S. Luus 52, M. Kapp 30 not out; A. Sutherland 1-26); AUSTRALIA 272-5 in 45.2 overs (M. Lanning 135 not out, T. McGrath 32; S.Ismail 2-33, C. Tryon 2-44). 
INDIA 229-7 in 50 overs (Y. Bhatia 50, S. Verma 42, S. Mandhana 30; R. Moni 3-37, N. Akter 2-42); BANGLADESH 119 all out in 40.3 overs (S. Khatun 32, L. Mondal 24; S. Rana 4-30).

14,Portugal replace goalkeeper ahead of World Cup qualifier,LISBON: Portugal have called up Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper Jose Sa to replace Anthony Lopes for the World ...,"LISBON: Portugal have called up Wolverhampton Wanderers goalkeeper Jose Sa to replace Anthony Lopes for the World Cup qualifier against Turkey on Thursday. 
The Portuguese Football Federation said Lopes has been ruled out because of an undisclosed injury. 
Portugal coach Fernando Santos also had to replace Pepe with Lille centre-back Tiago Djalo, 21, on Monday after the veteran defender tested positive for Covid-19. 
The 39-year-old FC Porto player’s absence means the former European champions will be without their two first-choice centre backs for the clash at Porto, with Manchester City defender Ruben Dias ruled out due to a hamstring injury. 
Midfielder Ruben Neves is also unavailable because of an injury. 
If they win against Turkey, Portugal will play either Italy or North Macedonia five days later in a game that will determine one of the last three spots left for European teams at Qatar 2022, which kicks off in November. 
It wasn’t yet clear if the 39-year-old Pepe would be able to play the second qualifier next week if Portugal advanced. 
Cristiano Ronaldo and his team-mates joined the national side’s training camp at Oeiras, near Lisbon on Monday. 
Portugal last failed to qualify for the World Cup in 1998, playing in each of the last five editions.
