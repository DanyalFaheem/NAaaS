0,Biden calls India ‘shaky’ in response to Russian invasion,Says Putin is trying to split Nato to weaken strong international stance,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has said that among America’s Nato and Pacific allies only India has been “somewhat shaky” in responding to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
In his address to a meeting of US business leaders in Washington on Monday, President Biden said his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin was trying to split Nato to weaken the strong international stance against the invasion but has failed to do so.
“I can assure you: Nato has never been stronger or more united in its entire history than it is today, in large part because of Vladimir Putin,” he said. “And in response to his aggression, … we presented a united front throughout Nato and in the Pacific.”

Says Putin is trying to split Nato to weaken strong international stance

In the Pacific, Washington has put together an alliance of like-minded nations — Australia, India, Japan and the United States — to counter China’s growing influence in the region.
Three of these four countries — Australia, Japan and the United States — have sanctioned Russian entities or people, but India has refused to do so.
President Biden also underlined India’s exceptionalism in his speech, noting that the Quad has endorsed the US-led sanctions, “with the possible exception of India,” which has been “somewhat shaky on some of this”.
But “Japan has been extremely strong, so has Australia, in terms of dealing with Putin’s aggression. We presented a united front throughout Nato and the Pacific,” Mr Biden added.
Russia is one of India’s oldest allies, the biggest supplier of military hardware to New Delhi and a major business partner, which explains India’s reluctance in going against Moscow.
India has urged an end to the violence in Ukraine, but has abstained from voting against Russia during recent UN debates.
On Saturday, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said after a meeting with the Indian prime minister in New Delhi that Russia’s invasion had shaken the “foundation of international order” and required a clear response.
However, the White House said last week that India would not be violating sanctions if it purchased discounted oil from Russia, but doing so would put New Delhi on the wrong side of history.
But President Biden’s reaction indicates that India’s reluctance has been felt in Washington too, which would like India to join other US allies in taking a strong stance against the Russian invasion.
The Indian media repor­ted last week that Indian Oil Corporation, the nation’s top oil firm, has bought three million barrels of crude oil that Russia had offered at a steep discount to prevailing international rates.

1,Pakistan asks Iran to open another trade gate at border,"Issue of electricity, water supply to Pakistan Customs House and local population adjacent to the border areas discussed.","QUETTA: Pakistan has asked Iran to open a gate at Gar — a border point in Makran division — for barter trade and supply of edible items and LPG cylinders. 
Various other issues were discussed at a meeting with the Iranian border authorities in Panjgur on Monday. The Pakistani delegation was led by the deputy commissioner of Panjgur, while the Iranian side was headed by Marzaban Grade-I at the meeting, which was attended by senior security officers from both sides. 
Official sources said Pakis­tan suggested to the Iranian authorities to open the gate at Gar border, along with border posts 169-170 and 171. 
The issuance of Rahdari to the people who have relatives on both sides of the border also came under discussion. The permission for supply of edible items and LPG cylinders through the Gar gate was a part of the agenda. 
“We also discussed permission for import of spare parts of Iranian vehicles plying in Makran and Rakhshan divisions,” the Panjgur deputy commissioner said. 
Most of these vehicles are being used for transportation of petrol and diesel from Iran and their supply to other areas of Balochistan. 
The issue of supply of electricity and water to the Pakistan Customs House and local population adjacent to the border areas was also discussed. 
The sources said the Iranian authorities assured the Pakistani side of resolving these issues as soon as possible.

2,"CJP-led bench to take up SCBA petition, presidential reference",Justice Qazi Faez Isa argues the two matters cannot be heard simultaneously.,"ISLAMABAD: The Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) constituted a five-judge apex court bench on Tuesday to hear the Supreme Court Bar Association’s (SCBA) petition over the no-confidence motion, together with the presidential reference seeking interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution. 
The hearing will commence on Thursday (tomorrow). The bench consists of CJP Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan, Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel, Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel.
At the last hearing on Monday, the CJP had hinted at constituting a larger bench to hear the matter together. The SCBA has sought a restraining order against the government’s “intentions” of stopping legislators from taking part in the vote on the no-trust motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan. 

Justice Isa argues the two matters cannot be heard simultaneously 

After Monday’s hearing, the Supreme Court said in clear terms that it was not inclined to take up the issue raised by SCBA counsel Mansoor Usman Awan, as well as counsel for the political parties which moved the no-trust motion, that Speaker Asad Qaiser had violated the Constitution by summoning the National Assembly session on March 25, three days beyond the stipulated 14-day period. 
“Our attention was drawn to the order issued by the Speaker in this regard, but we are not inclined to take up this matter as it was collateral to the questions of constitutional interpretation raised before the court not only in terms of the SCBA petition but also the reference moved by President Dr Arif Alvi in terms of Article 186 of the Constitution,” the order said. “In any event, for such matters the Constitution envisages a remedy before parliament itself.” 
Justice Isa’s objection
Senior puisine judge Justice Qazi Faez Isa on Tuesday wrote a three-page letter to the CJP, highlighting that the SCBA petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution cannot be heard simultaneously with the reference under Article 186 in which the president had sought an opinion on interpretation of Article 63A. 
The letter stated that the original jurisdiction under Article 184(3) of the Constitution and advisory jurisdiction under Article 186 were altogether different and thus could not be heard simultaneously. 
Moreover, it said, the composition of the five-judge bench consisted of judges who were 4th, 8th and 13th in seniority list of the court. This has been done by discarding the good practice of structuring the CJP’s discretion by predecessors of constituting benches consisting of senior most judges when cases involved important constitutional questions. 
Therefore, there is no discernible criterion in the constitution of the present bench, the letter regretted, adding that this was most troubling and gave rise to unnecessary and avoidable misgivings. 
The Constitution recognises the most senior judge of the apex court and with seniority comes responsibility, which must not be shirked, the letter said, adding that the senior most judge also ensures continuity of the Supreme Court as an institution, but this practice has been discarded, which may have adverse consequence for the institution.
