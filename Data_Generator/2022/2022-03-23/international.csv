0,Ukraine claims retaking key Kyiv suburb; Mariupol braves bombing,"Civilians fleeing Mariupol say the city is under rele­ntless bombardment, with blo­ck after block of destroyed buildings.","KYIV: Ukraine claimed on Tuesday it had retaken a strategically important suburb of Kyiv on Tuesday, while its forces battled Russian attempts to occupy the encircled southern port city of Mariupol. 
Civilians fleeing Mariupol said the city was under rele­ntless bombardment, with blo­ck after block of destroyed buildings and corpses in the streets.
Perched on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol is a crucial port for Ukraine and lies along a stretch of territory between Russia and Crimea. The siege has cut the city off from the sea and allowed Russia to establish a land corridor to Crimea. 
In their last update, Mariupol officials said on March 15 that at least 2,300 people, among them 117 children, had died in the siege.  
Thousands have managed to flee Mariupol, where the bombardment has cut off electricity, water and food supplies and severed communication with the outside world.
The city council said on Tuesday that more than 1,100 people who had escaped the siege were in a convoy of buses heading to a city northwest of Mariupol. 
But the Red Cross said a humanitarian aid convoy trying to reach the city with desperately needed supplies still had not been able to enter. 
Ukraine’s defence ministry said its forces were still defending the city and had destroyed a Russian patrol boat and electronic warfare complex.
Britain’s defence ministry said Ukrainian forces  “continue to repulse Russian atte­m­pts to occupy Mariupol”. Those who have made it out of Mariupol spoke of a devastated city. 
“They bombed us for the past 20 days,” said 39-year-old Viktoria Totsen, who fled into Poland.
“During the last five days the planes were flying over us every five seconds and dropped bombs everywhere on residential buildings, kindergartens, art schools, everywhere.” 
Advance slows down
But Russia’s ground offensive in other parts of the country advanced slowly or not at all, knocked back by lethal Ukrainian hit-and-run attacks.
Explosions and bursts of gunfire shook Kyiv, and heavy artillery fire was heard from the north-west, where Russia has sought to encircle and capture several suburban areas of the capital, a crucial target. 
According to Ukraine’s def­ence ministry, its troops had driven Russian forces from the Kyiv suburb of Makariv after a fierce battle.
The regained territory allo­w­ed Ukrainian forces to ret­ake control of a highway and block Russian troops from surrounding the capital from the north-west.

1,"Egypt hosts UAE, Israeli leaders for historic summit","It was the first summit of its kind, and signalled  “a new doctrine” of regional diplomacy championed by the UAE, analyst says.","CAIRO: Egypt hosted the Israeli and UAE leaders for unprecedented three-way talks on Tuesday as the Ukraine war rocks energy and food markets and major powers inch towards a revived Iran nuclear deal.
The summit was held in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh between Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and the UAE’s de facto ruler, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.
It comes nearly a month after Russia invaded Ukraine in a move that sparked concerns about security and sent prices of oil, wheat and other key commodities soaring.
Egypt, Israel and the United Arab Emirates are allies of the United States but they have so far avoided taking positions against Russia over its war on Ukraine.
“Against the backdrop of the recent developments in the world and the region, the leaders discussed the ties between the three countries and ways to strengthen them on all levels,” said a statement from Bennett’s office.
It was the first summit of its kind, and signalled  “a new doctrine” of regional diplomacy championed by the UAE, said Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid, a professor of political science at Cairo University. Bennett and Sheikh Mohammed had arrived in Egypt on Monday.
At their meeting on Tuesday, the three leaders discussed  “energy, market stability, and food security,” Egyptian presidency spokesman Bassam Radi said.
Israeli media said the leaders would also discuss reports that Iran and Western powers, including the United States, are close to a deal to revive the 2015 nuclear accord.
Bennett is vehemently opposed to the deal which is designed to prevent Israel’s arch foe Iran from acquiring an atomic bomb — a goal the Islamic republic has always denied.
The Israeli leader on Sunday appealed to the United States not to remove Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps from its blacklist of foreign terrorist organisations as part of a renewed deal.
Bennett also travelled to Sharm el-Sheikh in September last year, in what was the first visit in over a decade by an Israeli head of government.
Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel in 1979, after decades of enmity and conflict.
In 2020, the UAE  became the third Arab country to forge diplomatic ties with Israel,  under a series of US-brokered deals known as the Abraham Accords. 
“The UAE is interested in exporting the framework of the Abraham  Accords to the rest of the Middle East,” Sayyid said, adding the  accords addressed more than  “just security ties”. 
For Sayyid, Tuesday’s meeting was the real-world application of this approach. 
In contrast with Egypt, which has focused predominantly on strong  military and strategic ties with Israel, the UAE has hit the ground  running on robust economic relations. 
Within the first year of establishing diplomatic ties, the two  regional heavyweights had agreed a raft of deals ranging from tourism  and aviation to cutting-edge technology. 
The official Emirati news agency WAM said Tuesday’s meeting   “discussed ways of enhancing relations between the three countries”.

2,"Cause of China jet crash unknown, hunt for black boxes continues",WUZHOU: Crash investigators on Tuesday said they do not yet know why a China Eastern jet carrying 132 people plunged...,"WUZHOU: Crash investigators on Tuesday said they do not yet know why a China Eastern jet carrying 132 people plunged from the sky, with recovery teams still scouring a forested mountainside for flight recorders from the pulverised Boeing aircraft.
No survivors had been found nearly 36 hours after Monday’s crash — the deadliest air disaster in three decades in China, a country that had maintained an enviable air safety record.
“With the current information, we are unable to make a clear judgment on the cause of the accident,” Zhu Tao, director of the aviation safety office at China’s aviation authority, told reporters late on Tuesday. He said the focus is now on  “the search for flight recorders”.
Questions have mounted over the cause of the crash, which saw the stricken jet drop 20,000 feet (6,096 metres) in just over a minute before plunging into rugged terrain in southern China on Monday afternoon.
The velocity of the impact left twisted metal and passengers’ belongings scattered across a swathe of forest.
The airline has officially acknowledged that some aboard the jet, which was travelling from the city of Kunming to the southern hub of Guangzhou, had perished — but has stopped short of declaring all on board as dead. Contact has been made with the families of all on board, said Sun Shiying, chairman of China Eastern Airlines Yunnan.
The crashed plane, which was nearly seven years old, had met all airworthiness requirements pre-flight, he told reporters at Tuesday’s press conference.
President Xi Jinping called for a full probe shortly after the crash as search teams armed with drones descended upon the site in a rural area of Guangxi province. The Civil Aviation Administration of China has said it will conduct a two-week safety inspection across the industry.
On Tuesday, scorch marks were visible from the crash and resulting fire, rescue workers said, with one speculating that passengers had been  “totally incinerated” from the intensity of the blaze.
A villager near the sprawling crash site, giving only his surname Ou, recounted hearing a  “sound like thunder” followed by a blaze that blistered the surrounding hills.
A torn wallet and burned camera lens were among the eviscerated possessions captured on video by a reporter from the state-run People’s Daily who was able to enter the crash site. But journalists were blocked at a hillside checkpoint by a group of men identifying themselves as Communist Party members who said they had  “orders from above” to prevent access.
The disaster occurred after a high-speed vertical nosedive, according to a video carried by Chinese media. Flight MU5735, which took off from Kunming shortly after 1pm, lost contact over Wuzhou, a city in the Guangxi region, according to China’s aviation authority.
The foreign ministry said they believed all passengers on board were Chinese nationals.
In Guangzhou airport, staff assisted loved ones of the 123 passengers and nine crew members aboard the plane, which stopped sending any flight information after dropping a total of 26,000 feet in altitude in just three minutes. Relatives and friends of those onboard endured a grim wait for news.

3,Russia will use N-arms only if there’s ‘existential threat’: Kremlin,"“We have a concept of domestic security, and it’s public. You can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used,” says Kremlin.","WASHINGTON: Russia would only use nuclear weapons in the context of the Ukraine conflict if it were facing an “existential threat”, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told CNN International on Tuesday.
“We have a concept of domestic security, and it’s public. You can read all the reasons for nuclear arms to be used,” Peskov said. “So if it is an existential threat for our country, then it can be used in accordance with our concept.” 
Peskov’s comment came as interviewer Christiane Amanpour pushed him on whether he was “convinced or confident” that Putin would not use the nuclear option in the Ukrainian context.

4,Biden’s Supreme Court pick defends child porn sentencing record,Ketanji Brown Jackson was grilled on Tuesday in her bid to be the first Black woman on the country’s highest judicial bench.,"WASHINGTON: US Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson defended her record of sentencing in child porn cases and advocacy for terror suspects as she was grilled on Tuesday in her bid to be the first Black woman on the country’s highest judicial bench.
The 51-year-old Harvard graduate faces more than 18 hours of questioning in the US Senate on her judicial philosophy and career after being named by President Joe Biden to succeed retiring fellow liberal Justice Stephen Breyer.
Fielding a wide array of questions from Democrats and Republicans on the second day of hearings, Jackson confirmed her support for diversity, telling senators her parents went to segregated schools.
She stressed her backing for free speech protections for all Americans, and said the ability to bear arms is a  “fundamental right” guaranteed by the Constitution.
The Miami native is already expected to have enough votes in the 50-50 Senate to succeed retiring fellow liberal Justice Stephen Breyer without much of a fight — but her elevation would still be seen as historic.
Of the 115 justices seated during the Supreme Court’s 233-year history, 108 have been white men and none have been Black women.
Jackson’s advocates on the Democratic benches were keen to allow her the opportunity to offer  “pre-buttals” on the issues where they expect her to be most vulnerable to Republican attacks.
Right-wing Senator Josh Hawley listed several cases Monday that he said were examples of Jackson letting child porn offenders off the hook by deviating from federal sentencing guidelines in their favor.
“As a mother and a judge who has had to deal with these cases I was thinking that nothing could be further from the truth,” Jackson said Tuesday of Hawley’s claims.
Independent fact checkers, debunking Hawley, have said he neglected to point out that federal judges nationwide sentence below guidelines in roughly two-thirds of child porn cases.
Hawley also ignored the fact that prosecutors in most of the cases he cited had requested the lighter terms.
The bipartisan congressional body responsible for setting sentencing rules has acknowledged that the guidelines sometimes fail to appreciate the difference between viewing, possessing, transporting or distributing child porn and the more serious offense of making it.
Jackson also defended her role representing Guantanamo Bay detainees as a federal public defender, a part of her career that has raised Republican eyebrows.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States by Al Qaeda, Jackson represented Afghan Khi Ali Gul, who spent more than a decade at Guantanamo Bay before being sent home without charge.
“That’s what you do as a federal public defender — you are standing up for the constitutional value of representation,” she said.
Democratic committee chairman Dick Durbin asked Jackson about the contentious issue of increasing the current size of the nine-justice court, but she declined to weigh in with a personal view on so-called  “court packing.”
“My north star is the consideration of the proper role of a judge in our constitutional scheme,” Jackson said.

5,Shootings prompt US city to slap curfew on spring break,MIAMI: The US city of Miami Beach has declared a state of emergency and will impose a curfew this weekend to stem a...,"MIAMI: The US city of Miami Beach has declared a state of emergency and will impose a curfew this weekend to stem a wave of violence linked to the influx of revellers to Florida for spring break.
The decision comes after two shootings that left five people injured in recent days. 
“We can’t endure this anymore,” Mayor Dan Gelber said on Monday as he announced the decision.
“We don’t ask for spring break. We don’t promote it. We don’t encourage it.
We just endure it, and frankly, it’s not something we want to endure. We don’t want spring break.” The curfew, which covers the busiest area of the city including the famous Ocean Drive, will last from midnight until 6am on Thursday through Monday. Authorities plan to renew it next week.
Last year, police also imposed a curfew after arresting more than 1,000 people over the course of six weeks for street fights and vandalism.
To avoid a repetition this year, authorities have increased police presence in the busiest areas and banned bars from selling alcohol after 2am, rules that will be in place from March 7 to 21. They have seized 37 firearms in three days, Police Chief Richard Clements said on Monday.
Every year in the spring, hordes of partygoers take over the Miami Beach waterfront for late-night drinking parties that can quickly turn ugly.
It is part of the collective college experience of generations of US students — but residents have increasingly opposed the social gatherings despite the contribution to the local economy.

6,Fight over spilled drink led to fatal shooting in US city,A reporter and another man were caught in the line of fire and killed.,"NORFOLK: An argument over a spilled drink led to a shooting that killed two people, including a reporter, and injured three others outside a downtown Norfolk restaurant and bar over the weekend, according to the city’s police chief.
Chief Larry Boone told the Downtown Norfolk Civic League on Monday night that the argument began inside Chicho’s Pizza Backstage early on Saturday, but ended with a shooting outside, news outlets reported. 
Sierra Jenkins, 25, a reporter for The Virginian-Pilot and Daily Press, and Devon Harris, 25, of Portsmouth, were caught in the line of fire and killed, police said. Three others were injured.

A reporter and another man were caught in the line of fire and killed

Jenkins grew up in Norfolk and graduated from Georgia State University. She worked as an intern at Atlanta Magazine and CNN before joining The Pilot in December 2020.
This is another incident in which conflict resolution did not exist, Boone said.
Investigators do not have solid leads on a suspect, but Boone said he is cautiously optimistic they will make an arrest based on where the shooting occurred.
Witnesses were still being interviewed and reward money is being considered, Boone said. The Saturday shooting in downtown Norfolk was just one incident in a violent 20-hour stretch in Hampton Roads that left at least 15 people shot, four of them fatally, The Virginian-Pilot reported.
Despite a staffing shortage, stepped-up patrols downtown will begin on Thursday for better peace-of-mind downtown, Boone said.
Extra personnel will come from specialty units to complement officers who patrol the downtown area, he said.

7,Surface water availability becoming limited: Unesco,"Groundwater is often poorly understood and consequently undervalued, mismanaged and even abused, says Unesco","ISLAMABAD: The United Nations World Water Development Report has projected that while water use is projected to grow by roughly one per cent per year over the next 30 years, overall dependence on groundwater is expected to rise as surface water availability becomes increasingly limited due to climate change. 
Released by Unesco, on the occasion of World Water Day, the report points out the low use of water is not due to a lack of renewable groundwater, but rather by a lack of investments in infrastructure, institutions, trained professionals and knowledge of the resource. 
The report says groundwater accounts for 99pc of all liquid freshwater on Earth. However, this natural resource is often poorly understood and consequently undervalued, mismanaged and even abused. 
It says in order to meet global water and agricultural demands by 2050, including an estimated 50pc increase in food, feed and biofuel demand relative to 2012 levels, it is of critical importance to increase agricultural productivity through the sustainable intensification of groundwater abstraction, and decreasing the water and environmental footprints of agricultural production.
Regions heavily reliant on groundwater for irrigation, and in South Asia, 57pc of the areas equipped for irrigation use groundwater.
Asia-Pacific is the largest region in the world in terms of both area (28 million kilometres) and population (4.7 billion). The region is the largest groundwater abstractor in the world, the report says. 
The critical driver of groundwater development in the region is rising demand for water due to growing populations, rapid economic development and improving living standards. 
Utilisation of groundwater resources has provided numerous benefits for irrigation, industrial activity, domestic use, drought resilience and livelihood enhancement, according to the report.
These socio-economic benefits have been particularly crucial for the agricultural sector — a sector that is key to economic development in many developing countries in the region, and that accounts for an estimated 82pc of total water withdrawals.
Additionally, groundwater quality is under threat due to a variety of anthropogenic and geo-genic drivers that further contribute to water stress in the region.
It is estimated that agricultural pollution has overtaken contamination from settlements and industries as the major factor in the degradation of inland and coastal waters.
Nitrate, from chemical and organic fertilisers, is the most prevalent anthropogenic contaminant in groundwater globally. Insecticides, herbicides and fungicides, when improperly applied or disposed of, can pollute groundwater with carcinogens and other toxic substances.
Evidence suggests that laws and regulations to prevent or limit groundwater pollution from agriculture, and especially their enforcement, are generally weak. Policies addressing water pollution in agriculture should be part of overarching agriculture and water policy framework at the national, river basin and aquifer scale. 
In terms of climate change adaptation, the capacity of aquifer systems to store seasonal or episodic surface water surpluses can be exploited to improve year-round freshwater availability, as aquifers incur substantially lower evaporative losses than surface reservoirs.
