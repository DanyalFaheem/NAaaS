0,"Peshawar mayor promises elimination of street crimes, equal distribution of funds",asks council members to suggest corrective measures to curb street crimes.,"PESHAWAR: As the Peshawar City Council held its maiden sitting here on Tuesday, mayor Zubair Ali voiced concern about the growing street crimes, frequent traffic jams and lack of entertainment facilities for women in the provincial capital and said he would take all necessary measures for the effective resolution of those issues.
He also promised equal distribution of development funds to the treasury and opposition members.
Addressing the first sitting of the city council, Mr Zubair, who was elected on the JUI-F ticket in the first phase of local body elections on Dec 19 last year, complained that the incidence of street crimes had increased in the Peshawar old city alarmingly.
He said that whenever he visited the area, the residents complained about street crimes, so he was thinking about the revival of the ‘mohallahdari system’ to check them.
The mayor also asked the council members to suggest corrective measures.

City council holds maiden sitting

He also said that the second major issue of the old city was traffic jams.
“It takes us one hour to travel from the University of Peshawar to the nearby Hayatabad area due to the frequent snarl-ups. We have just one major artery in the city, which runs from the GT Road to the University Road, so we need to put a proper traffic plan in place to fix this traffic jam issue,” he said.
Mr Zubair urged the members to come up with proposals for smooth flow of traffic.
“You [council members] are the residents of the city, so you know the best places for traffic diversions, underpasses and flyovers,” he said.
The mayor also said that it was his great desire to establish separate parks for women.
He said that the city local government would focus its attention on the women’s education.
Mr Zubair said that the council members won’t be discriminated against on the basis of their political affiliations during the allocation of development funds.
“In this house, there are no opposition and treasury benches. You have not elected me and instead, the entire population of Peshawar has elected me to this office through direct elections and therefore, you are equally important to him,” he said.
The mayor said that residents of the respective neighbourhoods had confidence in council members, so they were elected to fight for the people’s rights and development.
“We have to run the city council smoothly in the larger interest of the people,” he said.
Mr Zubair urged members to avoid disruption of the proceedings saying such acts cause no good and instead, create bitterness in the house.
At the start of the sitting, all council members introduced themselves to each other.
During the session, the JUI-F and PTI members shouted slogans against each other causing pandemonium in the house briefly.

Addressing a seminar on trade with Afghanistan and security situation at Torkham, WPJ chairman Riaayatullah alias Khan Baba said that revival of the previous gate passes and token system would boost bilateral trade between the two neighbouring countries.
He said that it would also help in revival of jobs to thousands of local and Afghan labourers and daily wagers.

Local representatives of labourers and daily wagers had said soon after implementation of Ivas that it resulted in loss of jobs of thousands of people and confronted them with serious financial problems.
Khan Baba in his address to the seminar said that provision of personal passes and tokens to needy persons at Torkham was need of the hour. 
He said that WPJ would approach the federal government to address the problem. He said that a committee would be formed to negotiate the issue with the relevant officials.
He also called for early creation of border markets along all the border points with Afghanistan, saying it would not only promote bilateral trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan but would also create job opportunities for local people.
Khan Baba said that time was not far when trade activities with the Central Asian Republics would get an impetus at Pakistan-Afghanistan border points. 
He also demanded tax relief for investors so that the country could be put on the path of development.
Local leader of transporters Azeemullah Shinwari, labour leader Farman Khan, Landi Bazaar Traders Union president Jafar Shinwari and others also spoke on the occasion and talked about problems they were facing at Torkham border.

The tourists in the area also complained about cutting of trees in the Ushu forest. They said that the illegal act must be stopped immediately as it would affect the natural beauty of the area.
“We come here to enjoy the natural beauty. These trees are the most important part of natural beauty but I am sad that trees are being disappeared,” said Iqbal Khan, a tourist from Peshawar.
