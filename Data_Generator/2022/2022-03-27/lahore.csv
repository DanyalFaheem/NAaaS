0,Imran continues with his diatribe against opposition,"Says if Nawaz returns, he will ‘weaken institutions’","KAMALIA: For the first time hinting at a potential loss of power, Prime Minster Imran Khan on Saturday warned that once in power, the opposition would abolish National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to purge itself of previous corruption and commit new ‘financial crimes.’
Predicting the path to be taken by the Opposition, “then, the fourth character (referring to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif) of this drama sitting in London would return to launch malicious campaigns against the judiciary to divide it and attack the army as well. He will be helped by the media and the election commission.”
Addressing a charged crowd at Kamalia – an ancient town some 200 kilometers west of Lahore – he delivered a veiled warning to those who matter. If Nawaz Sharif returns, he will divide the judiciary – in fact he has already started doing it and signs are visible in the judiciary. But his target, as always, would be the army. He has not been able to work with the military.  

Says if Nawaz returns, he will ‘weaken institutions’

The previous NRO, given by former president Pervez Musharraf, washed them clean of earlier corruption. For the next 10 years, they made billions more, which they now want to launder themselves yet again.
Reiterating his interpretation of Islamic dictum of “good and bad” and neutrality in such situation, he again said that the “God has ordained us to side with the good. It is not a matter of choice, but command. The God has not left this discretion to people, but gave clear direction.”
Continuing with his customary name-calling for the opposition, he said he can only thank “three rats,” for bringing no-confidence motion. “The motion has boomeranged, reigniting passion in rank and file of the party and multiplying his support base. People now have a clear choice between the good and the bad. Asif Ali Zardari is facing  massive corruption cases, so is Shehbaz Sharif. Fazlur Rehman has ‘sold religion’ for politics but sold his soul for permits. These people know they would be in jail if I stay in power,” the prime minister told his substantial number of slogan-chanting audience.  
Imran Khan again brought up  foreign policy issues in the public meeting, saying that “why those 22 envoys breached diplomatic protocol and wrote a letter. The president of the European Union called me to request me to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. We need people of your stature to bring peace to warring parties,” were his words. People like Shehbaz Sharif cannot appreciate issues of such huge importance.Prime Minister Imran Khan took the occasion to invite people “to history-making event” in Islamabad today. “It is a chance for you be part of Rah-i-Haq (righteous path) caravan. Reach Islamabad as early as possible on Sunday because roads may be blocked later in the day because of massive number of commuters travelling to join the event.”

4,Pregnant woman injured in ‘police shooting’ dies in hospital in Bahawalnagar,"Police book deceased, her husband in robbery case; family alleges victimisation.","BAHAWALNAGAR: A three-month pregnant woman, who along with her husband was injured in police shooting in front of her house on Friday night, succumbed to her injuries at the DHQ Hospital on Saturday. 
On the other hand, the deceased, who had raised serious allegations against the police in her last video statements, was booked along with her husband and three other family members by the Madrasa police on charges of snatching mobile phones. The family denied the charge, saying it was a matter of land grabbing and the district police high-ups were supporting the influential land grabbers. 

Police book deceased, her husband in robbery case; family alleges victimisation

According to an FIR registered on Friday on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Shaukat Ali, Shabbir Ahmad of Abbas Nagar stormed the mobile phone shop of one Imran Malik and took away a mobile phone worth Rs20,000 at gunpoint sometime back. The FIR claimed that on Friday Shabbir, his brother, Dilgeer, along with two unidentified armed men, again forced their entry into the same shop and fled after snatching a mobile phone worth Rs30,000.  
Shabbir was in a car with a woman while his brother was on a motorcycle along with his accomplices.  
On receiving the information, a police team under the supervision of Shaukat Ali chased Shabbir and the woman but they managed to escape while firing on policemen. Shabbir and the woman suffered bullet injuries when his brother opened fire on the police team during the encounter, the police claimed. The woman was later identified as Shabana, the wife of Shabbir. 
After the shooting, Shabbir’s family along with locals held a protest against the police while terming the encounter fake. They told the media SHO Matloob Ahmad had attacked Shabbir after receiving bribe from their rivals. They claimed the influential landlords had occupied their three-kanal commercial land with the help of a former DPO. Shabbir’s mother asked how a man could take his wife along to commit a robbery. 
It is worth mentioning that Shabana, in her last two video statements (clips available with Dawn), recorded while lying injured on the road and later at the DHQ hospital. She alleged the police had shot at and injured her and her husband and killed their child inside her womb when they were going to take medicines for her mother-in-law.  
On Saturday, Shabbir’s father Faryad Ali told Dawn that after their protest over the shooting, SHO Matloob Ahmed visited him along with Saddar DSP Mehar Nadeem Afzaal and Investigation SP Farooq Anwar. He alleged that the SHO tried to take his thumb impressions on a blank paper and pressurised him for reconciliation. On his refusal, police booked two of his sons, Shabbir and Dilgeer, and daughter-in-law Shabana in a robbery case. He said the video of opening fire on Shabbir’s car by police officials also went viral as well as the last video statement of the deceased Shabana. 
Faryad alleged they were being victimised at the behest of a landlord and influential Malik family for years over their three-kanal land. He added that four years back, the former DPO had booked all of his family members in 12 fake cases of narcotics in a single day and allowed their rivals to occupy their land. He said that in 2017, SI Matloob had booked him along with his sons, Shabbir and Dilgeer, in a fake encounter case registered with Takhat Mahal Police Station at the behest of his rivals and later declared them innocent after getting Rs400,000 bribe.  
Faryad said that his daughter-in-law died last night at about 11pm; however, police did not hand them over her body as they demanded a marriage certificate, alleging that Shabbir had kidnapped Shabana. He said Shabana had contracted marriage with Shabbir of her own free will and was three months pregnant. When Faryad produced the Nikah Nama, the police asked him to bring Shabana’s parents for receiving her body.  
Faryad demanded the IGP take notice of the incident and appealed to human rights activists to raise voice over the injustice.  
DPO Zaffar Buzdar told Dawn that the police suspected that Shabana was not Shabbir’s wife and she was kidnapped by him. He said the body would be handed over to Shabbir’s family if they produced a marriage certificate. When informed that police refused to hand over the body despite production of the marriage certificate, he said the body would be handed over to the heirs (parents) of the deceased. Later, he claimed that on the court’s directions, Shabana’s body was being buried temporarily and it would be handed over to her blood relatives only. 
SHO Matloob denied all the allegations leveled by Shabbir’s family.  
DPO Buzdar said an inquiry into the viral video clips had been initiated under SP Investigation Farooq Anwar. He alleged that the family had a long criminal record, alleging that three brothers of Shabbir had already been shot dead in police encounters.  
Rejecting the DPO’s statement, Faryad says he has only six sons, Shabbir (20), Dilgeer (18), Zameer (16), Shamsheer (14), Azmat (11) and Karamat (9) and none of them even has a single case of theft against them.

5,Gentleman warrior who founded the ‘Fauj-e-Khas’,There are so many amazing stories of old Lahore that seem to be lost to the collective memory of the new expanded...,"There are so many amazing stories of old Lahore that seem to be lost to the collective memory of the new expanded city now of over 12 million. In 1947, just 74 years ago, the city’s population was 550,000. The rate of change you can well imagine.
In days of old, stories were carried through word of mouth, and one such story which I picked up from my late father was the story of ‘Kuri Bagh’. In an earlier piece a few years ago we dwelt on it, but then it was about time that its connection to the great Sikh-era general also needs to be told. The idea sprung after in Paris one came across the Allard Menu, considered the finest French cuisine. Food for a Lahori is a weakness. The Allard family is almost considered ‘royalty’ in the world of French cuisine. In Lahore, this general married the daughter of the Raja of Chamba, a relation of Ranjit Singh, and was hence considered ‘royalty’ by him.
When his funeral came to Lahore in February, 1839, the maharajah ordered a royal funeral. Never before had such a grand funeral been seen. Ironically, exactly 100 days later, the maharajah himself passed away.  
But let us stick to Allard. On Edwards Road is the mausoleum of the Sufi Mauj Darya. Next to it stood Kapoorthala House, which was once known as ‘Kuri Bagh’, or the daughter’s garden. The two daughters buried there both belonged to Gen. Jean-Francois Allard, the great French general who built the famous ‘Fauj-e-Khas’ and was the most trusted European officer in the Punjab Army.
As you move southwards on Old Anarkali Bazaar and reach Munshi Chambers, to the east is the back of the Income Tax Department building, also built on the original grounds of the garden. A lane along Munshi Chambers takes you to the back wall of the department and to the south you will see the grand mausoleum of Gen Allard and his two daughters. For years it was decaying, but then the French embassy in Islamabad provided funds for its conservation. My own take is that the scholar Jean-Marie Lefon, the Punjab history expert, had a hand in this effort. It is a magnificent building, and certainly worth a visit.
Now back to Gen Jean-Francois Allard, born in 1785 in Saint Tropez in France. At the age of 18 he joined Napoleon’s Army and during the various campaigns in Italy, Spain and Portugal, was injured several times, twice seriously. He was awarded by Napoleon himself with the ‘Legion d’Honour’ and promoted as a captain in the 7th French Hussar Regiment.
After the Battle of Waterloo, instead of surrendering he quietly slipped away eastward and ended up in Iran, where the ruler Abbas Mirza Qajar, himself a famous military commander of the Persian-Russo wars, recruited him for training his soldiers on modern European tactics. But as he went back on his promise to make him a colonel - after the British forced the Qajar king to dismiss all French soldiers - Allard quietly left and moved to Lahore in 1822, where after reasonable scrutiny Maharajah Ranjit Singh hired him to train his cavalry on modern European lines.
So it was that Allard raised a whole corps of ‘dragoons’ and ‘lancers’. After a demonstration in front of the impressed Maharajah, he was promoted and made a full-fledged general and his corps was named ‘Fauj-e-Khas’ (special corps). On hearing of his story, his bravery under Napoleon, his services to the Qajar ruler and the performance of his trained Persian troops, the British stab in the back, and then his marriage to the daughter of the ruler of Chamba, he was declared ‘Goora Shahi Sahib’.
But then Allard himself was a charming highly-educated army officer who had learnt the Persian language and could compose verses in it. He quickly picked up Punjabi. His stamp and coin collection of ancient India and Iran brought him fame among scholars, which still prevails. For his bravery he was awarded the highest Punjabi award the ‘Kaukab-e-Iqbal-e-Punjab’ (Bright Star of Punjab).
Now about the Fauj-e-Khas. When Allard took over the three battalions of Sheikh Basawan’s ‘Paltan-e-Khas’, of Sardar Bahadar Deva Singh’s ‘Shergils’, and the Gurkha regiment of Balbhadra Kunwar, he combined the three experienced regiments into the new ‘Fauj-e-Khas’ and re-equipped and modernised them to suit their European training. With new uniforms and coloured turbans this regiment was the most highly disciplined of the entire Sikh Army.
In later battles on every front this ‘Fauj-e-Khas’, led by Gen Allard from the front, because of their speed, penetrating power and tactics, all very disciplined, was described by Lord Roberts of India as the “finest army in Asia”. Initially they were called ‘Fransisi Sowar’, but then renamed ‘Rajman Khas Lansia’ or Special Lancer Regiment, and Rajman Daragun, or Dragoon Regiment. In the initial period the recruits protested against giving up the traditional ‘ghorcharas’ (horse displays), Allard retorted by recruiting a new regiment of dragoons.
By 1825 the forces under Allard reached 6,000 soldiers combined of cavalry, infantry and artillery. Allard took orders from only Ranjit Singh, who told him that he would not interfere. Amazingly the flag of the ‘Fauj-e-Khas’ was the French tricolour with the words ‘Vahiguru Ji Ki Fateh’. An East India Company document tells us that their intelligence assessment was that no British regiment could match them.
Just as centuries before the Mongols conquered the known world with sabres and high-speed horses, so the ‘Fauj-e-Khas’ had carbines used with great efficiency on fast-moving horses. For close quarter battles their curved sabres and winding daggers did the job. No prisoners were taken for it slowed down a thrust.
Their headquarters were in today’s Civil Secretariat in Lahore, with the old horse stable – where today our ancient archives lie rotting – the entire northern buildings housed the ‘fauj’. Ranjit Singh granted Allard several ‘jagirs’ and his salary was Rs30,000 a year. To understand its value imagine that gold in those days sold for $19 an ounce (today (2022) it is $2,000 an ounce). So by today’s standard, Allard’s monthly salary would be five million rupees a month. Such was the status and value of General Allard to Maharajah Ranjit Singh.
Among the military campaigns in which he excelled was the 1825 Peshawar and Derajat campaigns, the campaign against Syed Ahmed Barelavi, and the 1837 attack on Jamrud, in which Sardar Hari Singh Nalwa was killed. From Multan to Kabul to Kashmir and along the eastern borders, his soldiers wreaked terror. Their ability to move from battle to battle at great speed confused opposition. But back in Lahore, he was a most gracious host and a connoisseur of excellent French and Lahori food.
Gen Allard and his wife, Shahzadi Bano Pan Dei, who he had married in 1826 in Lahore, and his children went in 1834 to France on two years leave. He returned with gifts and a letter from the French king Louis Philippe. On his return in 1838 he was sent to Peshawar to assist Gen. Avitabile, where he had a heart attack and passed away. On his wishes, his body was brought back to Lahore and all along the route people gathered to pay respects. On crossing Shahdara on the 19th of February 1839, he was provided with gun salutes right up to ‘Kuri Bagh’, where his two daughters lay buried in a mausoleum he had got built himself.
The tomb of his daughter Marie Charlotte was constructed by Allard himself. His wife left Lahore and went to France where she died and was buried there. Such was the deep commitment of the great General Jean-Francois Allard to Lahore and its ruler. Unknown he lies in fast changing times.

7,Conference on ‘digital governance in post-pandemic world’ starts at ITU,LAHORE: A two-day conference on “Digital Governance in the Post-Pandemic World” being organised by the ...,"LAHORE: A two-day conference on “Digital Governance in the Post-Pandemic World” being organised by the Department of Governance and Global Studies and the National School of Public Policy at the Information Technology University (ITU) started on Saturday. 
The first day of the conference focused on how the pandemic changed the governance landscape of the country. 
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on National Health Regulations Dr Faisal Sultan underscored the importance of data. However, he noted that “unless data is properly used, it is mud”. He pointed out that when the pandemic hit Pakistan, the country had no national health policy. 
Talking about the start of the National Command Control Centre (NCOC), he noted how it integrated data from all sources to enable proper policy making.  
“The working of the NCOC ensured that policy was made and implemented throughout Pakistan, which resulted in the remarkable control of the pandemic and much lower deaths than was being predicted,” said Dr Sultan. 
Dr Sultan also mentioned that when the vaccine drive started, many people doubted that enough people would be vaccinated.  
“Today over 74pc of the eligible population in Pakistan is fully vaccinated, and this shows the success of our data driven strategy,” he remarked. ‘Even the US is behind us in this regard,” he claimed and added that they were also not going to let the success of the NCOC be diluted in the future.  
“We are going to transition to a national Centre for Disease Control on March 28, 2022, so that in the future we are always prepared to deal with national health emergencies,” he concluded. 
Speaking at the opening session, Dr Imdad Husain, the chairman of the department, underscored the importance of properly assessing how digitalisation was changing the world.  
Dr Ijaz Munir, rector of the National School of Public Policy, emphasized the changed nature of governance due to the pandemic and how his institute was enabling civil servants to understand the new reality.  
ITU’s Vice Chancellor, Dr Sarfraz Khurshid then spoke about how academia must collaborate with the government and the private sector to ensure the digital transition. 
Dr Yaqoob Khan Bangash emphasized that they should focus on developing a local model of governance. “Pakistan has always looked towards other countries for governance models but this pandemic has given us an opportunity to rethink and develop our own way of doing this,” he said. 
Other sessions on the first day focused on the challenges of adopting an e-governance model in the bureaucracy, where former federal secretary, Shoaib Siddique, spoke about the challenges of adopting the ‘e-office’ in the federal government. 
Urban Unit CEO Imran Sultan spoke about the problem of ‘crowding and saturation of e-tools’ in governance. 
Another session focused on how the education sector was changing due to e-solutions being utilised due to the pandemic.

In a press release issued on Saturday, IRMNCH & N Programme in response to a news item published in Dawn edition of March 24, said, “...these are cumulative provincial figures of maternal mortality reported by the  LHWs from all across the province. These figures include overall  mortality reported from public and private hospitals as well as from  homes and not from the Basic Health Units (BHUs) and Rural Health Centres (RHCs)”.
It further says that Punjab is the only province to have developed this system  to collect, consolidate and analyse maternal mortality data from  community and this data collection mechanism does not exist anywhere  else in the country. It adds that currently, Punjab has the lowest Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) in the country.  
It says most of these deaths are linked to deliveries at home as there is reluctance in community to seek services from skilled attendants and people mostly prefer local ‘dayee’ (birth attendant). 
It says out of 88,021 reported deaths, 62,831 were stillbirths which is a natural and global phenomena.  
It adds that IRMNCH programme transported 415,696 pregnant women to BHUs and RHCs to ensure safe deliveries. Similarly, it says, 46,854 women were transferred to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospitals (THQs) and District Headquarters Hospitals (DHQs) due to birth-related complications. In Punjab’s 1,234 BHUs not a single maternal death was reported in 2021, it says.   
It is, however, pertinent to mention that the Dawn story was based on an official report prepared by the Punjab Planning & Development Board.

This was claimed by Abul Hasan Naqvi, who is representing the PSP committee which is part of three-member team that negotiated with Additional Chief Secretary Sayed Ali Murtaza on March 24, while talking to Dawn.  
He said in 2002, 2005, 2009 and 2012, as many as 723, 870, 2,098 and 2,600 college teacher, respectively, were inducted on a contract basis. In the same manner as per the policy evolved by the Musharraf dispensation, around 500 commerce teachers were appointed in 2004 on contract by Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Tevta).  
He said [above] four batches of college teachers were regularised in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2015. Likewise, 500 commerce teachers were also regularised in 2012 after the federal government withdrew the contract policy in 2009 and asked all the federating units to regularise the services of contract employees.  
President Ittehad-i-Asatiza Pakistan Chaudhry Mustafa said both Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa followed the federal government’s directions and provided PSP to all contract employees. But the then Shahbaz Sharif-led provincial government in Punjab delayed the regularisation of contract employees for one year. Later, the PML-N provincial government continued with the contract scheme along with regularisation policy.  
PPLA Additional Secretary Ms. Sadia Alvi said the teachers were regularised without adding contract period of the service.  
Surprisingly, the Higher Education Department through a notification on July 9, 2013, withdrew its policy that had been agreed in 2009. The matter has been unresolved since then. 
An insider told this correspondent that as per the direction of the chief secretary, the provincial finance department and cabinet division along with the HED secretary had been working on the financial implication of PSP and “their figure is also matching with the amount calculated and provided by the members of the union.”  
A source in HED has claimed that the amount is not big and the department can manage it from its own allocated budget.

In response to the application, the court has summoned the parties on Tuesday next. 
On March 21, cracker vendor Muhammad Ashraf was allegedly lynched by wedding guests at Aljannat Marriage Hall, Pattoki.  
The incident was highlighted in the media and drew criticism when a video clip uploaded on social media showed wedding guests having dinner as the vendor’s body was lying nearby.  
Sources says that after the vendor died the suspects (wedding guests) dragged his body inside the banquet hall, covered it with a white cloth, and started taking dinner.  
Local police, however, denied any torture of the deceased, claiming they could not find any evidence of lynching. 
Preliminary medical report of the victim also supports the police’s stance. 
Nevertheless, a report submitted by the tehsil administration says the victim was tortured to death by an angry mob, accusing the vendor of pick-pocketing. 
The family of the victim, however, claimed that Ashraf’s body had torture marks which were noticed by those who gave the body a bath before the burial.  
The family also alleged foul play on the part of the medical officer who conducted the autopsy and added that police connived with the suspects.
