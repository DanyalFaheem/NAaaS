0,Political turmoil driving away foreign investors,Pakistan Investment Bond outflows have jumped 150pc over the last 10 days.,"KARACHI: An ongoing political crisis at home is putting pressure on the external economic front, as foreign investment outflows from equity, treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) have sharply increased during the ongoing month. 
Of the combined outflows of around $1.5bn during the ongoing fiscal year so far, as much as $400 million has flown out of the country during March alone, State Bank data showed on Saturday. 
PIBs have been the hardest hit — outflows during the first 14 days of March stood at $102m, which then skyrocketed 147pc to $251.5m within the next 10 days.
Such massive outflows were also witnessed in March 2020 — a month after the first Covid-19 case appeared in Pakistan — when the foreign investment of about $3.5bn left the country within a few months.

PIB outflows have jumped 150pc over the last 10 days 

At present, major foreign investments outflows are from PIBs despite high yields — returns on these bonds have increased to 11.85 per cent for the three-year tenor, 11.75pc for five years and 11.74pc for 10 years.
Similarly, yields on treasury bills rose to 11.99pc for three-month papers, 12.5pc for six months and 12.7pc for 12 months.
Money market dealers believe that returns on treasury bills and PIBs are highly attractive for foreign investors, as nowhere such high rates are available on government-guaranteed, risk-free bonds.
During the current fiscal year so far, the total PIB inflows stood at $104.3m. Inflows have so far remained just $0.15m during this month.
While inflows in treasury bills have remained zero this month, outflows have reached $100.4m, showing fast-eroding foreign investment from domestic bonds. 
The total inflows of PIBs and treasury bills during March stand at $0.15m, while outflows of the two domestic bonds are $352m. If outflows from equity is counted, the total outflows of foreign investment were $402.35m, while the cumulative net flow was $378.3m. Inflows in equity during March stands at $23.9m.
“There is no economic reason for these outflows since the government is not facing any serious trouble on the economic front, which, in fact, is in a better position due to higher exports, increased remittances and reasonable foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank,” said S.S. Iqbal, a money dealer in the banking system.
“The rapid outflows could be an outcome of the political crisis in the country and it may become worse,” he said.
The single-day outflow on March 24 was $91.3 million against an inflow of $2.3m in equity. The outflows from PIBs and treasury bills were $50m and $34.8m, respectively, during the same day.
During the ongoing fiscal year, the total outflows from equity, PIBs and treasury bills stand at $1.558bn against total inflows of $654.3m. So, the cumulative net flow during the nine months through March comes in at $904.36m.
The government and the central bank have launched the bonds two years back to attract foreign investors and the efforts continue to this day, as visible from the high returns on both bonds. 
However, the emergence of one crisis after another has never allowed foreign investors to stay for longer periods despite risk-free, high-yielding domestic bonds.

1,Tax collection from sugar sector jumps to Rs26.5bn,Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin says sugar production is likely to increase by 2m tonnes from last year to 7.5m tonnes.,"ISLAMABAD: The revenue collection in the current sugar crushing season posted a robust growth of 33 per cent over the corresponding period of last year, which according to tax officials is mainly due to the introduction of an innovative digital monitoring system of sugar production.
The sales tax collection reached Rs26.5 billion in the first four months — Dec 21, 2021 to March 22 — as against Rs19.9bn collected during the corresponding period in the last crushing season, registering an increase 33pc or Rs6.59bn. 
Besides the introduction of a digital system, the production of sugar also posted impressive growth in the current season.
Taking to Twitter Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin said that sugar production is likely to increase by 2 million tonnes from last year to 7.5 million tonnes. As a result, Pakistan is back to a sugar surplus country from a deficit, the minister said.

The minister further claimed that ex-mill sugar prices are now around Rs81 per kg substantially lower from last year.
Official data released by the FBR showed that as a result of this digital intervention, the sugar mills have produced record high sugar 7.51 million tonnes recorded up to March 24 as against 5.63 million produced during last crushing season, showing an increase of 34pc.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has implemented Track and Trace System (TTS) on the sugar sector during the current crushing season. The innovative digital monitoring system has been implemented over 79 sugar mills having 151 production lines nationwide.
Prime Minister Imran Khan had launched TTS on Nov 23, 2021 on the sugar sector. Thereafter, no sugar bags were allowed to be removed from the factory premises and sold in the market without tax stamps.
Owing to this transparent electronic monitoring of production, all sugar mills had to declare their actual crushing and production during the current crushing season.
However, there are reports that stamped bags are being purchased by the sugar millers from the open market at higher rates for re-filling. This is one grey area to conceal actual production and evade sales tax.
An official announcement of the FBR said that Inland Revenue Enforcement Network (IREN) squads, in a counter-evasion operation, conducted more than 60 raids in various markets throughout the country to ensure successful implementation of the TTS. During the operation, the unstamped bags were seized by FBR officials as per law and procedure, which were being sold without tax stamps.
FBR chairman Ashfaq Ahmed has reiterated that over the next few months, implementation of TTS on the entire tobacco sector as well as on other important sectors like fertilisers, petroleum, and cement will be ensured. It will result in digital monitoring of the large-scale manufacturing and production of these key sectors, he added.
Besides, preventing revenue leakages, the chairman said it will help in minimising human intervention and thus pave the way for a transparent and reliable tax compliance system across the country.

2,Stocks drift higher in a sluggish week,KARACHI: Trading remained sluggish in the outgoing week owing to endless uncertainty in domestic politics coupled...,"KARACHI: Trading remained sluggish in the outgoing week owing to endless uncertainty in domestic politics coupled with slow progress on the negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), according to Arif Habib Ltd.
The stock market gained some momentum initially amid a 78 per cent monthly contraction in the current account in February along with a landmark agreement over Reko Diq mines. However, the momentum proved short-lived. Rising cut-off rates in the treasury bills’ auction signalled monetary tightening while the rupee weakened to its historic low of 181 against the dollar.
Negative triggers kept the market range-bound as the index settled at 43,551 points after adding 522 points or 1.2pc from a week ago.
Sectors that contributed positively were fertiliser (160 points), cement (97 points), power generation and distribution (57 points), commercial banking (56 points) and chemical (47 points).
Sector-wise, negative contributions came from automobile parts and accessories (16 points), paper and board (6.95 points), miscellaneous (6.29 points), oil and gas exploration (4.02 points) and insurance (2.58 points).
Most positively-contributing shares were Habib Bank Ltd (93 points), Lucky Cement Ltd (84 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd (72 points), TRG Pakistan Ltd (64 points) and The Hub Power Company Ltd (52 points).
Stock-wise, top negative contributors were Systems Ltd (42 points), United Bank Ltd (41 points), Bank AL Habib Ltd (25 points), Thal Ltd (16 points) and Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd (11 points). Foreign selling continued in the outgoing week with the net outflows of $4.12 million versus a net sell of $4.9m in the preceding week.
Major selling was witnessed in banks ($5.9m) and exploration and production ($0.8m). On the local front, buying was reported by mutual funds ($5.3m) and individuals ($2.6m).
According to AKD Securities, the market will continue to be guided by the domestic political situation. “Similarly, the market will watch the (price) movement of global commodities very closely and react accordingly,” it said. News flows relating to the ongoing IMF review will also dictate market sentiments in coming weeks, the brokerage added. “We advocate for gradual accumulation in fundamental scrips with a longer-term focus,” it noted.
The brokerage said it prefers banking stocks as the central bank is expected to opt for monetary tightening, which will have a positive impact on lenders’ bottom lines. In addition, stocks in the fertiliser sector are also likely to stay in the limelight, thanks to a recent hike in urea prices.

3,Iran reacts to Kuwait-Saudi gas field deal,"Says the agreement is ""illegal"" and ""contrary to current procedures and previously held negotiations"".","TEHRAN: Iran on Saturday branded  “illegal” a deal reached between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to develop a disputed gas field in the Gulf, insisting on its right to also exploit it.
The energy ministers of the Gulf Arab states signed an agreement on Monday to develop the Arash/Dorra gas field, according to an official Kuwaiti statement.
The move comes with energy prices soaring on world markets in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Iran’s foreign ministry dismissed the agreement as  “illegal” on Saturday, saying it was  “contrary to current procedures and previously held negotiations”.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran reserves its right to exploit the Arash/Dorra gas field,” the ministry’s spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a statement.
“Any action for the operation and development of this field must be done in coordination with and cooperation of all the three countries.” The dispute dates back to the 1960s, when Iran and Kuwait each awarded an offshore concession, one to the former Anglo-Iranian Petroleum Co, which became part of BP, and one to Royal Dutch Shell.

4,"ADB asks Pakistan to boost savings, investments",Says says a non-diversified finance sector represents a risk because of the inability to deal with financial shocks.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s economy remains vulnerable despite a stable debt outlook as investment rates have remained very low at 15.2 per cent of GDP in the last fiscal year, says the Asian Development Bank.
The under-developed capital markets in Pakistan have contributed to the ineffective mobilisation of savings, leading to a wide saving-investment gap. The banks’ own credit origination capacity was hampered by the ineffective role of the country’s capital markets, and the economy remained dependent on volatile foreign capital.
The development of domestic capital markets can have the benefit of increasing the government’s access to local currency financing by issuing debt through domestic open-market operations and thereby help manage foreign exchange risk and inflation better.
An ADB internal report connected with the approval of a $300 million loan on March 22 to further develop Pakistan’s capital markets, promote private investment and help to mobilise domestic resources to finance sustainable growth, says Pakistan significantly below peer countries on key capital market-related indicators.
At 15.2pc of GDP, Pakistan’s investment rate in the fiscal year 2021 is almost half of the South Asian average of 31pc of GDP. For an economy at Pakistan’s development stage, this low level of capital investment reflects low investor and business confidence and also constraints future growth. Nascent capital markets are part of the problem. Stock market capitalisation, at 17.4pcof GDP as of June 2021, has been declining and is below the figures for India (99pc) in 2020.
In Pakistan, assets managed by mutual funds and pension funds represent a fraction of those in regional peers. Pakistan has the lowest open-end fund asset base among its regional peers in Asia and the Pacific, totaling $6 billion or about 2pc of its GDP, the report says.
Pakistan’s finance sector is predominantly a bank-based system. As of December 2020, bank assets accounted for almost 75.5pc of the country’s total financial assets, whereas national saving instruments accounted for 12.7pc, the insurance sector 5.5pc, and non-bank financial institutions 5pc. Such a bank-dominated finance sector reflects a lack of capacity in the non-banking sectors and capital markets, points out the report.
The ADB report says a non-diversified finance sector represents a risk because of the inability to deal with financial shocks and periods of uncertainty. It also fails to support the development of long-term finance and risk capital solutions.
In addition, the lack of sufficient outstanding stocks of marketable and market-friendly government securities at crucial yield tenors impairs the formation of an effective pricing and risk management benchmark for financial deepening in local currency. This greatly impairs banks’ maturity transformation. Banks in Pakistan mainly offer short maturity loans and offer very limited long-term financing for infrastructure projects, it says.
Underdeveloped capital markets with a limited role in financial intermediation and resource mobilisation. The PSX lacks depth in the number of investors and the number of companies raising capital. As of December 2021, about 255,000 individual investors have a stock investing account. 
The role of capital markets has regressed, with the number of companies listed in the PSX declining from 747 in 2001 to 533 by December 2021.

5,Developing states may need $310bn for debt servicing: Unctad,ISLAMABAD: The United Nations trade and development body has warned of short-term public debt servicing needs as a...,"ISLAMABAD: The United Nations trade and development body has warned of short-term public debt servicing needs as a growing concern in the wake of Ukraine war and monetary tightening. Developing countries are projected to require $310 billion to meet external public debt service requirements in 2022, according to UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad). 
Pakistan, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Egypt and Angola are the countries which appear vulnerable to a sudden stop due to a combination of large rollover pressures and a large debt service to export ratio. Pakistan, Egypt and Angola already have long-term International Monetary Fund programmes in place, Unctad said in its update to the Trade and Development Report 2021.
Public sector external debt vulnerabilities are substantial, especially in low-income countries. Public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debts in developing countries represented 64.4 per cent of the total stock of external debt in 2020.
The update, released on March 24, has downgraded its global economic growth projection for 2022 to 2.6pc from 3.6pc due to the Ukraine war and to changes in macroeconomic policies made by countries in recent months. While Russia will experience a deep recession this year, significant slowdowns in growth are expected in parts of Western Europe and Central, South, and South-East Asia.

7,Solar net-metering connections being provided on priority: Nepra,Nepra chairman says the regulator is working on providing cheap and clean energy to consumers.,"LAHORE: For quick disposal of solar net metering connection-related applications, we have allowed the respective power distribution companies (Discos) to approve applications seeking connection up to 25 kilowatts, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) Chairman Tausif H. Farooqi said on Saturday. 
Speaking to the media at the10th Solar Pakistan Exhibition at the Lahore Expo Centre, Mr Farooqi said that despite opposition, Nepra allowed the launch, completion and promotion of solar power projects across the country. We did it in a bid to provide cheap electricity to the people of Pakistan, he added. 
While responding to media queries, the Nepra chairman said the regulator was trying hard to provide cheap and clean energy to the consumers. “Giving subsidy on power tariff is the sole discretion of the federal government and not Nepra,” he added. 
The three-day solar power exhibit was inaugurated jointly by the Nerpa chairman, PM Task Force Chairman on Housing Zaigham Rizvi and Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) Chairman Shah Jahan Mirza. 
Speaking on the occasion, AEDB CEO said plans were afoot to launch the process of competitive bidding for the new wind and power projects to meet the targets of clean and green energy as given in the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP) 2021-2030. 
The exhibition has brought a number of solar power generation companies, solar panel and other equipment manufacturers and promoters under one roof to not only create awareness on renewable energy among the public at large but also convince them to go for solar net metering for getting cheap energy resources.
“I have come here to meet with the companies engaged in installing solar power system with net metering provision to domestic, commercial and industrial consumers,” said Furqan, a visitor at the exhibition. 
“I think this is the best time to switch to solar power since the massively increasing electricity tariff has almost become unaffordable,” he added. 
More than 100 companies involved in the business of solar energy and relevant fields are participating in the event. 
The organisers expect attendance of as many as 10,000 visitors including traders and industries experts in the three-day exhibition. 
It may be mentioned that Pakistan, according to energy experts, is blessed with renewable energy resources and it is high time to harness the same to overcome the energy woes of the country. 
They say that the proliferation and promotion of solar energy can go a long way to overcome the energy crisis.
