0,Taliban ‘block unaccompanied women from flights’,"Girls, women hold protest in Kabul against school closure.","KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers refused to allow dozens of women to board several flights, including some overseas, because they were traveling without a male guardian, two Afghan airline officials said on Saturday, whereas dozens of girls demonstrated in the Afghan capital demanding the right to go to school. 
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from the Taliban, said dozens of women who arrived at Kabul’s international airport on Friday to board domestic and international flights were told they couldn’t do so without a male guardian.
Some of the women were dual nationals returning to their homes overseas, including some from Canada, according to one of the officials. Women were denied boarding on flights to Islamabad, Dubai and Turkey on Kam Air and the state-owned Ariana Airline, said the officials.

Girls, women hold protest in Kabul against school closure 

The order came from the Taliban leadership, said one official.
By Saturday, some women traveling alone were given permission to board an Ariana Airlines flight to western Herat province, the official said. However, by the time the permission was granted they had missed their flight, he said.
The airport’s president and police chief, both from the Taliban movement and both Islamic clerics, were meeting on Saturday with airline officials. “They are trying to solve it,” the official said.
It was still unclear whether the Taliban would exempt air travel from an order issued months ago requiring women traveling more than 72 kilometres to be accompanied by a male relative.
Taliban officials did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Meanwhile, about two dozen girls and women chanting “open the schools” protested in the Afghan capital on Saturday against the Taliban’s decision to shut their secondary schools just hours after re-opening them this week.
Thousands of jubilant girls across Afghanistan had flocked to learning institutions on Wednesday — the date the education ministry had set for classes to resume.
But just hours into the first day, the ministry announced a shock policy reversal that left youngsters saying they felt betrayed and foreign governments expressing outrage.
“Open the schools! Justice, justice!” chanted protesters Saturday, some carrying schoolbooks as they gathered at a city square in Kabul.
They held banners that said: “Education is our fundamental right, not a political plan” as they marched for a short distance and later dispersed as Taliban fighters arrived at the scene.
The protest was the first held by women in weeks after the Taliban rounded up the ringleaders of initial demonstrations held after they returned to power in August.
The government has not given a clear reason for their decision, which came after a meeting late Tuesday of senior officials in the southern city of Kandahar, the Taliban’s de facto power centre and spiritual heartland.
It followed months of work by some foreign countries on a plan to support the payment of teachers’ wages.
Afghan secondary school girls have now been out of education for more than seven months.
Right to education
“Even Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) said everyone has the right to education, but the Taliban have snatched this right from us,” said youngster Nawesa at the demonstration, which was organised by two women’s rights groups.
“The Taliban cannot oppress the women of Afghanistan,” said another protester, Laila Basim.
Since returning to power on August 15 the Taliban have rolled back two decades of gains made by the country’s women, who have been squeezed out of many government jobs, barred from travelling alone, and ordered to dress according to a strict interpretation of the Koran.
The Taliban had promised a softer version of the harsh rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001.
But many restrictions have still been imposed — if not at the national level then implemented locally at the whim of regional officials.
Some Afghan women initially pushed back against the Taliban’s curbs, holding small protests where they demanded the right to education and work.
But the Taliban soon rounded up the ringleaders, holding them incommunicado while denying that they had been detained.
Since their release, most have gone silent.

1,"Closed since 2019, Khunjerab to reopen for trade from 1st",Khunjerab Pass was closed in November 2019 to contain the transmission of the coronavirus.,"GILGIT: After remaining closed for more than two and a half years, a key land border crossing between Pakistan and China at Khunjerab is  being reopened for trade activities from April 1.
Khunjerab Pass was closed in November 2019 to contain the transmission of the coronavirus between the two countries.
The  pass was temporarily opened in July and September 2020 and again in  November 2021, only to facilitate the transportation of the  containers  loaded with goods that had been stranded in China.
During the  temporary opening of the border, stranded containers from China were unloaded at Khunjerab Top instead of the port at Sost.
A notice issued by the district administration of Kashgar of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region said  that according to an agreement signed by China with the government of Pakistan on May 22, 2013, the Khunjerab Pass will be officially upgraded on April 1, 2022.
According to officials, Chinese authorities have shared a letter with Pakistan regarding the reopening of the pass from April 1.
It is also mentioned in the letter that measures would be in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19. 
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industries capital  office in-charge Qurban Ali told Dawn the prolonged closure of Khunjerab Pass had caused immense financial hardships to the local business  community. 
GB traders have been demanding regular opening of trade through Khunjerab Pass with strict SOPs.
However, he said it is not yet clear whether trade is being opened on  a regular basis or would just be limited to dropping containers at the  Pakistan side.
Mr Ali said the region’s business community was dependent on trade with China, as there was no other industry there.
He demanded that Chinese authorities should relax visa conditions and allow border pass facility for Gilgit-Baltistan traders to travel to China.
Port authorities on the Chinese side have been instructed to take all necessary coronavirus preventive measures before the start of the arrival of goods from Pakistan.
Similarly, Pakistani border authorities have also been instructed to ensure the containment of the disease.
Under the protocol agreement signed between the two countries, trade and travel activities through Khunjerab pass continue from April to November.
Gilgit Baltistan is considered the gateway of CPEC, and locals say it is important to open regular trade through  Khun­jerab Pass to ensure the success of the One Belt One Road project.

2,"Afghan embassy, consulates in US shut their doors",Afghan diplomatic missions in the United States faced serious financial issues after the US government froze Afghan assets.,"WASHINGTON: The Afghan embassy and their consulates in the United States have ceased operations and transferred custodial responsibility of their properties to the US State Department. 
Afghan diplomatic missions in the United States faced serious financial issues after the US government froze Afghan assets in the US banking system. The sanctions caused many diplomats and staff members to go unpaid for months. 
Earlier this month, the State Department announced that the embassy would be closed, and diplomats would have 30 days to apply for residency or humanitarian parole, as one-fourth of the 100 diplomatic staff in the United States had not applied till then. 

Sanctions imposed after Taliban takeover caused many diplomats, staffers to go unpaid for months 

Last week, the Afghan embassy sent a letter to the State Department, saying that from March 16, 2022, the embassy and Afghanistan’s consulates in the United States had ceased operations and transferred custodial responsibility of their properties to the State Department. 
The letter pointed out that even after the Taliban’s “forceful and illegitimate takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021,” the Afghan embassy in Washington and consulates in New York and Los Angeles “remained committed to serving the Afghan people” by continuing operations and providing consular services. 
During this period, the Afghan embassy and the consulates faced growing operational challenges and severe resource constraints due to freezing of its bank accounts, and the diplomatic missions sought assistance from the State Department, the letter added. 
The letter pointed out that the State Department suggested transferring custodial responsibility of the embassy and the consulates to the US government in accordance with the Vienna Convention as the only viable option. 
“Given that the operation of the diplomatic missions is not sustainable, the embassy and the consulates have concurred with the State Department’s suggestions. However, the Afghan embassy and consulates in the US hope that a practical solution will be found promptly, especially given the absence of essential consular services for Afghan citizens in the United States,” the letter explained. 
The letter recalled that together, Afghans and Americans made numerous achievements in human rights, women’s empowerment and democracy in Afghanistan.  
“Unfortunately, these achievements are now threatened by the imposition of a totalitarian theocracy on our people by a terrorist group,” the letter claimed.

3,SC ‘leniency’ led to sacked workers’ restoration,Detailed verdict says the employees were nearing retirement and had minimal job prospects.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has issued a detailed verdict of its December short order in which it reinstated thousands of government employees, who had been sacked through its earlier August judgement that struck down the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Act 2010.
In the late-night detailed verdict, the apex court explained that the sacked government employees were restored in their positions from Aug 17, 2021 since they deserved leniency for rendering their services for 10 years or more. It said the employees were nearing retirement and had minimal job prospects.
In its Dec 17 short order, the Supreme Court dismissed review petitions filed against the August verdict, declaring that the 2010 act “is held to be in violation of, inter alia, Articles 25, 18, 9 and 4 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and therefore void under the provisions of Article 8”.
Passed with a majority of four to one, the verdict dismissed 108 petitions, rendering almost 16,000 government workers jobless.
However, the dissenting member, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, allowed review petitions against the August ruling. He emphasised that parliamentary sovereignty or legislative supremacy was the cornerstone of a strong democracy and therefore the judiciary must recognise the central role of the legislature.
Authored by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, the detailed majority judgement observed that it was no fault of these employees since the beneficiary employees were inducted and subsequently reinstated into the service of their employers without the fulfilment of the necessary codal formalities.
Therefore, in exercise of our inherent power conferred under Order XXXIII, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules of 1980 and in reliance on our power to do ex debito justitiae (as a matter of right), the employees were reinstated.
The judgement said the Supreme Court could not be precluded from converting one type of proceedings into another type, including the existing review proceedings under Article 185(3) of the Constitution and exercising our jurisdiction under Article 184(3).
“The courts are sanctuaries of justice and in exercise of authority to do ex debito justitiae to remedy a wrong and to suppress a mischief to which a litigant is entitled to,” the judgement observed. “Therefore, no fetters or bar could be placed on the high court or the Supreme Court to convert and treat one type of proceeding into another type and proceed to decide the matter.”
The copies of the judgement were also sent to the employers concerned, the Ministry of Law and Justice and the establishment division for appropriate action.

4,Biden doubts Russia dialling down Ukraine aims,"Calls Vladimir Putin a ""butcher"" in meeting with refugees in Warsaw.","WARSAW: US President Joe Biden cast doubt on Russia’s signal that it may scale down its war aims to concentrate on eastern Ukraine, as two Russian missile strikes slammed into the west of the country on Saturday, wounding five.
After failing to break Kyiv’s ferocious resistance in a month of fighting and deadly attacks on civilians, the Russian army in a surprise announcement said it would focus on “the main goal — the liberation of Donbas”.
But Biden said he was “not sure” that Moscow has indeed changed strategy, as he branded Russian President Vladimir Putin a “butcher” while meeting Ukrainian refugees in Poland.
The US leader assessment came as two missiles struck a fuel depot in western Ukraine’s Lviv, a rare attack on a city just 70 kilometres from the Polish border that has escaped serious fighting since Russian troops invaded last month.

Calls Vladimir Putin a ‘butcher’ in meeting with refugees in Warsaw  

At least five people were wounded, regional governor Maksym Kozytsky said, as journalists in the city centre saw plumes of thick black smoke.
Putin sent troops into Ukraine on Feb 24, vowing to destroy the country’s military and topple pro-Western President Volodymyr Zelensky.
But his army has made little progress on capturing key cities, and its attacks that have hit hospitals, residential buildings and schools have become more deadly.
Biden, who has been leading efforts among Western allies to press Putin to end his invasion of Ukraine, has blasted Putin as a “war criminal” over the assaults on civilians.
The Kremlin hit back at Biden’s description of Putin as a “butcher”, saying “a state leader must remain sober-minded”.
“Such personal insults are narrowing down the window of opportunity for our bilateral relations under the current (US) administration. One should be aware of this,” said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, in remarks carried by state news agency TASS.
Unwavering 
Biden, who is on a two-day visit to Poland after holding a series of summits in Brussels with Western allies, earlier met Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov in Warsaw in an emphatic show of support for Kyiv.
Both ministers had made a rare trip out of Ukraine for the face-to-face talks, in a possible sign of growing confidence in their fightback against Russian forces.
The talks discussed Washington’s “unwavering commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters.
Biden, who later met Polish President Andrzej Duda, also stressed the “sacred commitment” to Nato’s collective defence, in a clear reassurance to Ukraine’s neighbours rattled by the conflict.
“You can count on that... for your freedom and ours,” he told Duda.
Speaking after visiting Ukrainian refugees later on Saturday, Biden said he had been asked by children to pray for their male relatives fighting in Ukraine.
“I remember what it’s like when you have someone in a war zone and every morning you get up and you wonder... you are praying you don’t get that phone call,” said Biden, whose son Beau served in Iraq before dying of a brain tumour.
‘Everybody’s shooting’ 
On the frontlines, Russia’s far-bigger military continued to combat determined Ukrainian defenders who are using Western-supplied weapons — from near the capital Kyiv to Kharkiv, the Donbas region and the devastated southern port city of Mariupol.
A humanitarian convoy leaving Mariupol, including ambulances carrying wounded children, was being held up at Russian checkpoints, a Ukrainian official said.
A build-up of several kilometres had formed close to Vassylivka, in the region of Zaporizhzhia where the convoy was headed, said Lyudmyla Denisova, in charge of human rights in Ukraine.
