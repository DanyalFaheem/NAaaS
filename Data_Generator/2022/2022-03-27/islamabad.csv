ISLAMABAD: Khaas Gallery on Saturday opened its doors to a new group show by contemporary miniature artists who challenged the miniature tradition with their unique perspective.
The group show titled ‘Gentrification’ showcased the works by Waseem Ahmed, Sobia Ahmed, Babar Gull, Ghulam Mohammad, Syed Hussain and Ayesha Durrani.
Starting from basic forms and shapes teetering between lines and grid, Lahore-based artist Babar Gull used line in his works to explore the concepts of belief, divinity and to reach somewhere from one point to another. 
“My studio practice has evolved. My main interest remains in exploring the ways in which we defy our coping mechanisms. While working I became interested in graph, making compositions with graph. All of the work explores the potential of the line as various implements,” the artist, who is a BFA from Hunerkada, told guests on the opening day.
For Sobia Ahmed, the initial visual impact a piece of art had on the viewer was more important than any subsequent notion he or she later conceived about the piece.
“This poses a problem, as often, having an idea in your head and further transforming it into a piece of art is a tricky thing to do, with the resulting image often deviating from the original subject. Often the resulting piece mutates into something else,” she said, adding that, “during the course of my career, my aim would be to create a kind of multi-layered timelessness that, I believe any piece of art must have if it is to gain any ounce of recognition in the world of art”.
Her work examined the gradual decline of ideology in Pakistan. This decline had often been attributed to the influence and interference of the West in Pakistan’s sociopolitical structure.
“Therefore, I have attempted to create interplay between the past and the present in order to demonstrate how our subjugation by the British has damaged and even further hindered the growth of our culture and ideology,” Ms Ahmed, who holds a bachelor’s degree in miniature painting, as well as masters in visual arts, from the National College of Arts (Lahore).
Works by Waseem Ahmed represented a state of uncertainty, a reflection on the unpredictability that was all pervasive and had changed life for everyone so abruptly, with only a vague sense of what the future held. 
Waseem Ahmed in this series of work had given an insight to the audience on how he saw the present keeping the past in mind.
He studied historical imagery intensely and related them to the present times as he saw history in its cyclical form, repeating itself again and again. In this series of work, Mr Ahmed had highlighted the feeling of hope and, at the same time, disappointment. The show will run till April 9.

7,Over 77pc small businesses use Facebook to generate revenue: report,"The report is based on a survey of 24,000 small and medium business leaders across 30 countries and territories.","ISLAMABAD: More than 77 per cent of small and medium businesses (SMBs) are using the platform of Facebook to generate revenues, according to a report.
The Meta Report on “Global State of Small Business 2022” was based on a survey of 24,000 small and medium business leaders across 30 countries and territories.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has developed the Global State of Small Business Report to monitor the health of SMBs. The survey aimed to provide information that can facilitate research and policy discussions on how to support SMBs.
During the survey, 18pc of SMBs in South Asiastated that they had increased employment as a consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic.
The highest rate was recorded in Pakistan at 26pc compared to just 9pc in India.
Moreover, 35pc and 34pc of SMBs, respectively, in Pakistan and Philippines were planning to have only in-person operations.
At the same time, non-government sources of finance were popular in some countries and territories and Pakistan was among the highest in this category with 32pc of SMBs taking up private sector financing, including non-government cash grant or loan from a charity etc, and also because the government support was low.
The study was conducted in January when many parts of the world were seeing a surge in Covid cases due to the Omicron variant.
It said 75pc of women-led SMBs and 83pc of men-led SMBs were using the Facebook platform globally reported that they were operational or engaging in revenue-generating activities.
Besides, 26pc of operational SMBs using the Facebook platform reported that their sales in the past month were higher than the same month last year while 52pc reported their sales were lower.
Women-led SMBs were, however, more likely to report that none of their employees had a university degree compared to their men-led counterparts. Additionally, women led SMBs were more likely to report using digital tools for advertising and communicating with customers than men-led SMBs.
Small businesses all over the world have struggled throughout the pandemic. When Meta surveyed thousands of small and medium businesses globally last year, there were signs that recovery was underway but then the Omicron wave hit sales and supply chains, causing many to close their doors once again.
According to the survey, more than a third of small businesses that made at least 50pc of their sales digitally also reported improved sales overall.

12,PTI activists from Azad Kashmir vow to renew allegiance to Imran,Pledge to show up to Sunday's power show in Islamabad in large numbers.,"MUZAFFARABAD: A large number of ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists on Saturday vowed to “renew their allegiance” to Prime Minister Imran Khan by showing up at Sunday’s grand power show in the federal capital in big numbers in the face of “appalling intrigues against him by the gang of power-hungry politicians.”
The commitment was made by them at the riverside residence of PTI’s former central joint secretary and minister for local government and rural development Khawaja Farooq Ahmed.
Participants, including office bearers of local bodies of PTI and its affiliates, stressed that it was high time “everyone who wanted to see a corruption free Pakistan joined forces to teach an unforgettable lesson to the bunch of power-mad politicians” in the country.
They also discussed measures for Sunday’s journey and decided to start it from Naluchi Bridge at about 10am.
Later Mr Ahmed told reporters at the Press Club that the enthusiasm and devotion of PTI activists was exemplary.
“They have decided to firmly rally behind their incorruptible leader Imran Khan who has raised the status of Pakistan with his independent foreign policy on the one hand and talks about the Kashmir issue in the most convincing and forceful manner,” Mr Ahmed said.
He wondered why the opposition parties which had been at daggers drawn for years together had suddenly colluded with each other to oust PM Khan a year before the end of his stipulated constitutional term.
“It’s under an international agenda,” he said, and added: “However, since every Pakistani has full realisation of their nefarious designs PM Khan is receiving overwhelming support from all parts of the country,” he said.

13,Court warns JUI-F against blocking roads for public gathering in Islamabad,IHC chief justice directs district magistrate to ensure NOC conditions are enforced.,"• Chief justice directs district magistrate to ensure NOC conditions are enforced
• JUI-F assures capital admin to follow terms
• Maulana Fazl reaches Islamabad
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Saturday warned the Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) against violating conditions of the no-objection certificate (NOC) for holding a public gathering under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) and directed the capital administration to act against violators in accordance with law.
On the other hand, organisers of the JUI-F public gathering assured the capital administration that they would follow the terms and conditions of the NOC in letter and spirit.
In another development, PDM president and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman arrived in Islamabad on Saturday night leading a rally from his hometown Dera Ismail Khan.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah disposed of a petition filed by the deputy commissioner of Islamabad seeking initiation of proceedings against the organisers of the public gathering for violating the NOC’s condition of not obstructing public passages.
The capital administration had on Friday issued a show-cause notice to the JUI-F for planning to set up a stage on Srinagar Highway by blocking the road in violation of the terms and conditions of the NOC.
The notice was issued by Deputy Commissioner (DC) Hamza Shafqaat to the JUI-F Islamabad emir, Maulana Abdul Majeed Hazarvi, asking him to reply within 48 hours otherwise the NOC would be cancelled.
It said according to the terms and conditions, the rally planned by the JUI-F shall not disturb or disrupt fundamental rights of the citizens.
The plan to block Srinagar Highway needs preemptive actions by the district administration to maintain law and order and to protect public rights, it said, adding that hence the organisers were being served with a show-cause notice asking them why the NOC issued for the public gathering may not be cancelled.
“In consequence of the non-compliance of the show-cause notice, the capital administration shall withdraw the NOC of the rally and you shall be responsible for any untoward incident,” the notice said.
It observed: “It is an onerous duty of the district magistrate and the law enforcement agencies to enforce the law. It is their constitutional obligation to take all measures as may be necessary to enforce the conditions explicitly mentioned in the permissions/NOCs.”
The court warned that “any violation or breach would expose the political parties as well as their leadership to the consequences prescribed under the law. The state through the district magistrate and law enforcement agencies shall ensure compliance of the conditional permissions/NOCs and to proceed against the violators in accordance with law regardless of their status and positions.”
The district magistrate, therefore, is directed to ensure that the conditions explicitly mentioned in the permissions/NOCs are enforced and strictly complied with failing which action ought to be taken to remedy the mischief or contravention.
The district magistrate/deputy commissioner had filed the petition for initiating proceedings against the respondents who are organising the JUI-F gathering.
The district magistrate asserted that the JUI-F leaders Maulana Abdul Majeed Hazarvi and others, who were granted permission to hold the public gathering near Peshawar Mor, intended to violate the permission/NOC.
The court observed that maintaining public order was the fundamental duty of the state. Section 31 of the Police Act 1861 declares that it is the duty of the police to keep order on public roads, public streets, thoroughfares and all other places of public resort. It has been unambiguously declared as a duty of the police to prevent obstruction on roads and thoroughfares on the occasion of assemblies and processions.
The IHC chief justice noted that “it is an offence for any person to cause obstruction, inconvenience, annoyance or damage to other citizens. An unlawful assembly, inter alia, includes a common object to commit mischief, resist the execution of any law or of any legal process and it has been made punishable under section 142 of Pakistan Penal Code 1860.”
“It is the duty of every citizen, particularly political parties, to obey the law. All political parties, which have been granted permissions/NOCs, are bound by the conditions mentioned therein. No one is above the law and it is definitely not expected from political parties and public officeholders to resist, breach or in any manner disobey the law and the lawful orders issued by the district magistrate in order to maintain peace and public order,” the court order stated.
After the court order, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry asked the JUI-F to avoid closure of roads. He said the IHC had ordered the administration to keep roads open, therefore, no political party would be allowed to exhibit their power on roads.
Meanwhile, PDM president and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman reached Islamabad on Saturday night leading a rally from his hometown Dera Ismail Khan.
Party workers, who had gathered on Srinagar Highway, received the Maulana with loud slogans.
Talking briefly to reporters, Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that caravans from all over the country were on their way to Islamabad for a historic public meeting tomorrow (Monday).
He said the days of the present PTI government were numbered. He, however, evaded a question of reporters whether his party planned to stage a sit-in or would they disperse after the public meeting.
JUI-F assurance to capital admin
The organisers of the JUI-F public gathering on Saturday assured the capital administration that they would follow the terms and conditions of the NOC.
Officials of the capital administration said the assurance was given in response to the show-cause notice and the direction of the IHC.
The officials also said the JUI-F removed fixtures being used to prepare the stage on Srinagar Highway and shifted them to the venue allocated for its public gathering.
The officials told Dawn that separate NOCs for the public gatherings had been issued to the PML-N and JUI-F for March 28.
However, permission sought by the JUI-F for a public gathering on March 27 had been denied. Any public gathering on March 27 in the capital by the JUI-F will be unlawful, the officials said.
The capital police were also asked for a contingency plan to meet any untoward situation. Over 200 containers have been arranged and put at different places and more were being arranged.
Cameras have been installed on Parade Ground and H-9 to monitor the gatherings of the PTI and opposition parties. Besides, a control room has been established in the interior ministry to monitor public gatherings through cameras.
Meanwhile, the capital administration also ordered to close and vacate the metro bus depot in H-9 from March 26 onwards.
An order issued from the office of the deputy commissioner stated that to avoid any untoward incident and to strengthen security and safety of public property/installation during protests/rallies near the metro bus depot, it is requested that the depot at Peshawar Mor may be closed from March 26 till further order.
