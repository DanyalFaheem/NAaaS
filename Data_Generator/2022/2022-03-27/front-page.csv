ISLAMABAD: Nerves are on edge as the federal capital braces for a political showdown on Sunday (today), as the ruling PTI is going all-out to make its Amr Bil Maroof public meeting successful amid mounting pressure from opposition parties, which are also marching on Islamabad before the vote on a no-confidence  motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
Workers and leaders of the JUI-F, under the banner of the opposition alliance PDM, have already come to take the stage on the Srinagar Highway while PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz, along with Punjab opposition leader Hamza Shehbaz was leading her party caravan via GT Road to the capital, calling it the last nail in the coffin of the PTI government. 
Read: Will PM Imran's trump card be able to help him survive the no-trust vote?
Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid, speaking at a presser in Islamabad, warned the JUI-F that it would not be permitted to hold a sit-in in Islamabad, as they had been allowed to hold the public meeting on Saturday only and they would need to submit another request if they wanted to hold rally on Sunday, too. 
He also cautioned that no party would be allowed to enter Red Zone and action would be taken against those who attempted to take law into their hands by blocking another party’s route or by holding a sit-in in violation of Supreme Court directions. He said the interior ministry would cooperate with opposition parties in connection with their upcoming rallies and no-confidence vote and provide full security to “all their lawmakers”.
Security 
Mr Rashid said the Srinagar Highway had been handed over to Pakistan Rangers and Frontier Corps, saying that in all 15,000 personnel would be performing security duty. Besides, the government had the authority to call army under Article 245 of the Constitution, if need be, but hoped the situation would not reach a point where the ministry was compelled extreme measures, he said.
Meanwhile, PTI workers also started turning up in the twin cities from different parts of the country to reach the Parade Ground, where the stage has been set for party’s grand power show amid the allegations levelled by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) that the ruling party received its funding from other countries to bring people on streets. 
Conspiracy
“A conspiracy is being hatched to cause bloodshed on the streets of Islamabad,” PPP Senators Palwasha Khan and Rubina Khalid told a press conference. The PPP had lately also advised other opposition parties against holding a sit-in in the capital to avoid clashes.
Senator Khan said: “Threats are coming from countries, like India and Israel, from where funding for the PTI had come. And, it is being spent on public meeting.” According to her, it was not the job of interior minister to lead a procession against the opposition. “The interior minister will be responsible for all situations,” she said, advising the ruling PTI to face the no-confidence motion in a constitutional way.
Media stopped
For what is being claimed as ‘historic jalsa’, which would be addressed by Prime Minister Khan, a PTI spokesperson on Saturday evening announced that the media professionals would not be allowed to use professional cameras to record the event as “cameras pose security risk”.
The PTI rally organisers and media crew exchanged arguments when the latter were told that cameras of private TV channels would not be allowed due to the “security protocol” of the prime minister but they would be allowed to use their mobile phones for footage and photos. The photojournalists decided to lodge a complaint to the media bodies against the PTI attitude.  
When contacted, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhary later said that efforts were being made with the relevant authorities to facilitate the media. “We have always assisted media persons to execute their duties and a separate enclosure has been established for local as well as international media,” he claimed.
Prime Minister Khan earlier announced that the gathering of his supporters would not be less than a million. After that ‘public show’, the PTI leaders believe that the pressure of a no-confidence motion against the premier would defuse.
PML-N march
Earlier in the day, the PML-N’s anti-inflation long march kicked off from party’s main secretariat in Lahore’s Model Town with its leadership hoping that it would prove the last nail in the coffin of the Imran government which was facing a no-trust move.
Led by deposed Maryam and Hamza, the rally was heading at a snail’s pace towards its destination in Islamabad where it would join the nine-party alliance PDM caravans to hold a public meeting. The PML-N said the PDM’s long march could stay in the capital for two or more days depending on the political situation despite the interior minister’s warning that the opposition would not be permitted to extend its stay.
Meanwhile, the Islamabad High Court on Saturday warned the JUI-F against violating conditions of the no-objection certificate for holding a public gathering under the PDM banner and directed the capital administration to act against violators in accordance with law. The organisers of the JUI-F public gathering assured the capital administration that they would follow the terms and conditions of the NOC in letter and spirit.
Along the route to Islamabad, PML-N workers had set up reception camps at different points where they danced to the tune of party songs as their leader waved to them. “We have covered hardly a few kilometres in four hours because of a large number of participants,” Maryam Nawaz said, adding that Mr Khan had already lost power and only a ‘formal announcement’ was to be made. “His cries are the herald of his departure. Once the long march reaches the capital the departure of the selected regime will be announced,” she said, predicting difficult times ahead for him. “Once he is out of power, his corruption stories will come to the fore and evidence be presented. I stand by my claim that billions of rupees have been made in transfers and postings by those who have direct links with the Banigala (residence of Imran Khan) which is a mother of all scandals,” she said.
Talks with PML-Q
Talking to a private news channel, Maryam and Hamza said the opposition’s talks with the government ally PML-Q were under way and because of the public pressure, the Chaudhrys of Gujrat would take side with it (opposition).
Asked if the PML-N leadership had refused to make Chaudhry Parvez Elahi chief minister in Punjab, Ms Nawaz said: “No such decision has been taken as yet. The allies will join the opposition knowing the ground realities.” Hamza said the opposition had been in contact with the PML-Q. “After the success of the no-trust move against Imran Khan, the next target of the opposition is Punjab,” he said.

1,JUI-F asks SC to return reference unanswered,Says that any court decision on the reference will erode the supremacy of parliament.,"ISLAMABAD: While the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) believes lifetime disqualification of a lawmaker for defection from their political party, being a penal measure, should be left with their constituency to decide, the Pakistan Peoples Party has argued that the presidential reference on Article 63-A is against fundamental rights as it also seeks to take away the right of appeal provided by Article 63(5). 
The opposition parties have submitted their written comments before the Sup­reme Court in response to the direction of the SC bench, headed by Chief Jus­tice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, hearing the presidential reference along with a petition of the Sup­reme Court Bar Association (SCBA) against the government’s alleged ‘intention’ to stop lawmakers from voting on the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
Senator Kamran Murtaza, in the reply filed on behalf of the JUI-F, apprised the apex court that severe consequences such as lifetime disqualifications for defections from party under Article 63-A of the Constitution ‘without vote count’ would undermine the already weak democracy. 
The JUI-F was of the opinion that any court decision on the controversial reference would erode the supremacy of parliament, and therefore the top court should hold that the present reference was beyond the scope of Article 186 of Constitution and an attempt to undermine the parliament hence be returned unanswered. 
However, the opposition party also argued if a situation under Article 63A of the Constitution arises, where the party head tells the MNAs to vote, but some members abstain from voting, then should the NA Speaker be empowered to count their vote even though MNAs chose not to vote. Similarly, the JUI-F wondered, if the Speaker, after “counting votes” of the MNAs who “refused to vote”, disqualify them for life. In its opinion, the opposition party said such situation would lead to absurd and flawed interpretations.  
The JUI-F stated opinions were to be sought about issues where there was no clarity on law on the issue. The party also suggested to the apex court that opinions sought did not have to be necessarily answered to the president within a “certain timeframe”. 
According to the JUI-F, as the no-confidence motion is pending and if there is an apprehension of defection, then the matter will likely reach the Supreme Court being the appellate body under Article 63A(5) of Constitution. Thus giving an opinion that too without examining the facts of each case will make the forum of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) completely redundant.  
The JUI-F regretted that the president wants this court to go beyond its jurisdiction and to put on the robes of the legislature to create law regarding the no-confidence motion as per the wishes of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf only. 
Meanwhile, PPPP through Senator Farooq H. Naek regretted that National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser had been attending meetings of the core committees of the ruling PTI, presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan, with alleged mala fide intent and thus becoming part of political process of the ruling party in “violation of his oath and provisions of Constitution”. 
Thus, Speaker Qaiser by violating Article 54 of the Constitution was allegedly subverting Article 54(3) and Article 95 of Constitution and Rule 37 of the Rules of National Assembly and obstructing members of National Assembly from discharging their constitutional and parliamentary duties and responsibilities and thus committing “high treason” as defined in Article 6 of the Constitution.  
It regretted that the speaker in violation of the Constitution also abdicated powers conferred on him to the political party to which he belongs. 
In its reply on the presidential reference, the PPP explained that Pakistan is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and therefore it is not only the constitutional duty of the state organs to ensure enforcement of fundamental rights but they are also under an obligation to refuse to abide by or implement directives which “place hurdles or embargo on exercise of civil and political freedom”. 
It mentioned that all citizens had a right to liberty, movement and security under Article 4 and the MNAs, too, had an inviolable right to be dealt with in accordance with law and under Article 14 of the Constitution that says “dignity of man is inviolable”.

2,PTI assures ‘Q’ Chaudhry Parvez Elahi is their man for Punjab,Senior PML-Q leader says Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar will be asked to resign in a day or two.,"LAHORE: With the process for the no-confidence motion set to kick off on Monday afternoon, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government made last-ditch efforts on Saturday to convince their allies, the PML-Q and MQM-P, to support the prime minister. 
“A government team led by Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has given his words that Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar will be asked to resign in a day or two, and that Chaudhry Parvez Elahi is the PTI government’s preferred choice for his replacement,” a PML-Q senior leader told Dawn seeking anonymity. 
After some news channels quoted sources as saying that Mr Buzdar had prepared a summary to dissolve the Punjab Assembly, a PML-Q leader claimed: “The Punjab Assembly will not be dissolved, but a change of leader of the house is on the cards.” 
“PML-Q secretary general and federal minister Tariq Bashir Cheema told the government team to make a formal announcement regarding Mr Elahi as the candidate for the CM before going for voting on the no-confidence motion in the National Assembly,” a leader of the allied party told Dawn. 
Meanwhile, it was learnt that PM Khan took CM Buzdar along with him to Islamabad after the public meeting in Kamalia, instead of the former returning to Lahore. 
The PTI government team, also comprising Defence Minister Pervaiz Khattak, flew to Lahore from Islamabad and met leaders of the allied party, Parvez Elahi, federal ministers Cheema and Chaudhry Moonis Elahi. PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain was in Islamabad. 
In the meeting, sources say, the Chaudhrys reiterated their long-standing concerns with the ruling party as well as their demands, including the Punjab chief ministership. “As the government team could not make a commitment in black and white, the Chaudhrys stressed that their meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan is the need of the hour,” a senior PML-Q leader told Dawn. 
The government side conveyed the prime minister’s message to the allied party and discussed issues of mutual interest, including the political situation, in a cordial atmosphere. 
Mr Cheema apprised the PTI ministers about the problems his party had been facing for the last three and a half years, and openly discussed their solutions. He told the delegation that the PML-Q supported the government during the tough times, but the graciousness was never reciprocated. 
“We did not see the ruling party’s support for the PML-Q in the constituencies of Salik Hussain as well as my own. The PML-Q stuck with the government for over three years, but the PTI never took it into confidence during consultations on larger issues in the country and Punjab. Despite being coalition partners, the PML-Q faced opposition-like treatment from the PTI government,” the minister said. 
A PML-Q spokesman said the government team assured them that they would inform Prime Minister Khan about the entire situation. The PML-Q leadership would take its president Chaudhry Shujaat into confidence about the meeting and the next meeting would be held in Islamabad soon. 
Sources said FM Qureshi assured the PML-Q leadership that Mr Elahi would be the PTI candidate for the Punjab CM’s slot, as many factions had been created within the ruling party and there would be no consensus candidate.  
They further said that because of the many divisions within the ruling party, it will be next to impossible to get Mr Elahi elected as the chief minister. 
It was also learnt that the government team was on a mission to meet the allied parties to ensure it had the numbers against the opposition to win the no-trust move. 
“The government team asked Mr Elahi how it should convince other allied parties, and were suggested that they not be given any lollipop, but rather all the commitments must be fulfilled regarding local problems as well as extending ministries to them,” a PML-Q leader told Dawn. 
In Islamabad, the government team headed by Foreign Minister Qureshi held another round of talks with the representatives of the ally Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) at the Parliament Lodges and discussed the prevailing political situation in the country with specific reference to the upcoming vote on the no-confidence resolution. 
In a statement, Mr Qureshi claimed that talks with the MQM remained “encouraging” and the two sides had agreed to continue meetings.  
The government team comprised Sindh Governor Imran Ismail and federal ministers Asad Umar, Pervez Khattak and Ali Zaidi. 
The MQM was represented by Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Aminul Haq, Amir Khan, Waseem Akhtar, Khawaja Izharul Hassan, Javed Hanif and Sadiq Iftikhar.

3,FIA asked to nab absconding MNA returning for no-trust,"Minister says Jam Abdul Karim, wanted in Nazim Jokhio murder case, did not obtain bail; will be held upon arrival from UAE.","KARACHI / ISLAMABAD: Sindh Governor Imran Ismail on Saturday formally asked the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to arrest Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Jam Abdul Karim upon his scheduled return to the country from the UAE on March 29.
The PPP MNA has apparently made a calculated move to return for the crucial National Assembly session to vote on the no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan in line with the party policy.
On Friday, Karim was granted a 10-day protective bail by the Sindh High Court in the murder case of Nazim Jokhio; he was asked to appear before the trial court within the said time period.
His return is likely to encourage the opposition parties desperately trying to ensure the support of enough number of lawmakers in the Lower House, but it also triggered the ruling party that made a preemptive move and decided to engage the FIA. Governor Ismail wrote to the agency chief to arrest the PPP MNA and hand him over to the Sindh police.
“Jam Abdul Karim is wanted in the murder case of Nazim Jokhio,” the Sindh governor said. “We have heard he’s planning to return and attend the National Assembly session. He’s involved in a heinous crime. We cannot leave any accused in such a situation. I have asked the FIA to enlist his name in the Provincial National Identification List (PNIL) as the accused is wanted in an FIR lodged by the Memon Goth police station.”

Minister says Karim, wanted in Jokhio murder case, did not obtain bail; will be held upon arrival from UAE 

The PNIL is a 30-day temporary travel restriction introduced in 2018 as an alternative to the more tedious Exit Control List.
This new twist in the ongoing government-opposition clash emerged on Friday when hours after the SHC granted bail to the MNA, pictures of his air ticket went viral on social media, suggesting he is scheduled to land in Islamabad on March 29 from Dubai on a foreign airline flight.
The PPP MNA and his brother, MPA Jam Awais, are key suspects in the torture and murder case of Nazim Jokhio, who resisted hunting of the Houbara Bustards by the lawmakers’ foreign guests in November 2021 in Achar Salaar village on the outskirts of Karachi’s Malir district. Mr Jokhio was found dead at the Malir farmhouse of the MPA. Although Awais had been arrested, his elder brother had fled to the UAE.
With all legal formalities in place, legal experts believe there is little room for the PTI government to move against the PPP MNA.
“Since the Sindh High Court has granted a 10-day protective bail to the MNA, the law enforcement agencies cannot arrest him till April 3. They can only take him into custody if he fails to surrender before the trial court within the stipulated period,” said senior criminal lawyer Muhammad Farooq.
Facility for murder suspect questioned Interestingly, MNA Karim was among the three opposition lawmakers who were absent during the March 25 National Assembly session when the no-confidence motion was moved. The other two were Ali Wazir, who has been in judicial custody in Karachi since December 2020 in sedition cases, and one from Jamaat-i-Islami who decided to stay neutral. 
The issuance of protective bail to the MNA to attend the all-important NA session created a storm on social media where users questioned the high court’s move to facilitate a suspect wanted in a murder case and absconding abroad, while the assembly speaker could not issue the production orders of Mr Wazir.
MNA Karim had applied for a protective bail first with the Islamabad High Court (IHC), which refused to entertain the petition, after which the lawmaker moved SHC.
An IHC official told Dawn that Karim, through his attorney Shah Khawar, had filed the petition. However, the registrar office raised the objection that it was filed without completing the requirements.
The official said the petition was filed through an authorised person, but the authority letter was not counsularised by the Pakistani mission in the UAE and verified through biometric means. After the IHC chief justice sustained the objections, counsel Shah Khawar had withdrawn the petition.
‘No bail notice received’ 
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid announced that Karim would be arrested upon his arrival from Dubai. Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the minister claimed the suspect was returning without obtaining a bail.
“We will arrest him from the airport and hand him over to Sindh police. We have not received any notice (about a bail),” he claimed, adding the MNA’s name will also be sent to Interpol since the Sindh home department will not do so because the PPP needed his vote.
The minister said he had spoken to the Sindh inspector general of police, adding the MNA’s name was already on the PNIL.
Hours after the press conference, the Exit Control List committee of the Cabinet met and recommended placement of the names of all accused/co-accused in the case, including MNA Karim, on the ECL.

4,Men’s jealousies drive murders of trans persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,Murders of trans persons have occurred across the province with shocking regularity.,"

Mano only wanted to get what she was owed, but her marakh did not see things that way.

 
For many days before her death, Mano, a trans woman from Peshawar, had been fretting about her expenses. Weddings were a major source of income for her and she was worried that, with the onset of Ramazan, she wouldn’t be making any money for about a month. 
She had a way out, but it was a difficult one. A man she had previously been romantically involved with had borrowed a sum of over Rs800,000 from her: if she could get it back, she wouldn’t have to worry about money for the foreseeable future. 
She decided to give it a try. 
Last Friday afternoon, Mano made her way to a printing press in Peshawar’s Mohallah Jangi area, next to the historic Qissa Khwani Bazaar. This press was owned by Sanaullah, her former acquaintance. She approached him and explained her predicament; why she wanted her money back. He turned her down and told her to get lost, but she made it clear she wasn’t going to leave without the money she was owed. Enraged at her persistence, Sanaullah shot her dead. He escaped through the labyrinthine streets of the area. 
Mano’s family, which hails from the Batkhela area of Malakand, refused to even accept her body, leaving it to the local transgender community to arrange her last rites. Arzoo Khan, president of the Transgender Association KP, told Dawn that Mano’s family refused to take part in her burial, saying they wanted nothing to do with her either in life or in death.
“We had to arrange people to bathe her body. Our neighbours shouldered her coffin to the graveyard where she was laid to rest.” 
Spurned love 
Murders of trans persons have occurred across KP with shocking regularity. Though no exact numbers are available, unofficial figures put the toll since 2015 at more than 70. 
Mano’s death was the third killing of a trans person within a week. On March 17, a trans woman, Chaand, was shot dead in Mardan while another, Honey, was injured in the same attack. The attack was perpetrated by a suspect identified as Osama, who, according to police, had been angry at Honey for spurning him. Osama had opened fire on Honey but ended up injuring her and killing Chaand. He was later arrested by police. 
Earlier, on the night of March 13, five transgender persons were injured when a disgruntled ex-lover of one opened fire at the group. Natasha, who was injured in the attack, told Dawn that her friend Mona had met the group in a bazaar and insisted that they accompany her to her place. She said that when they reached Mona’s residence, the group proceeded upstairs while Natasha stopped to pay the taxi fare. “I heard four to five gunshots and ran upstairs to find four of my friends lying on the floor,” Natasha said. The attacker, who was still inside, opened fire as Natasha tried to run from the scene. She sustained a bullet in her thigh. Sumiro, one of the injured, later succumbed to her injuries. 
Since Mano’s murder, two other incidents of targeted violence against trans persons have been reported separately from Mardan and Peshawar. Late on Saturday, unknown motorcyclists opened fire near Mardan Museum on Charsadda Road, killing Coconut and injuring Wara. The two were returning after performing at a function in Charsadda district. 
In the provincial capital, the Chamkani police station arrested five suspects for abducting Sheeza as she was returning after performing in a musical event. Police, after receiving information, intercepted the abductors at a checkpoint on Ghaz Chowk, safely recovered Sheeza and arrested the five suspects. 
These incidents and many more like them in the past have brought the role of partners, known locally as ‘marakh’, into scrutiny. Taimur Kamal, a transgender rights activist, explained to Dawn that marakh are romantic partners who financially support the trans person. While in some cases families have also murdered their transgender members for so-called ‘honour’, these marakh are responsible for most of the murders of trans women in KP. 
“Economic and social vulnerability forces trans persons to approach many people,” Mr Kamal explained. Lacking employment, transgender persons are either forced to become sex workers or dancers at weddings. It is difficult for them to shun advances from men. However, the marakhs many a times become vindictive upon seeing their partners with others, which motivates the murders. 
A couple of years back, one such marakh was caught with the dismembered body parts of a trans woman in the Bara Gate area of the provincial capital. The killer later told the police that he had spent huge sums on her and could not bear seeing her with anyone else. 
A culture of impunity 
According to Mr Kamal, faulty police investigations are the reason most of the murderers eventually walk free. He believed the government needs to amend criminal laws and make the state a party in cases involving the murder of trans persons, as the community is, due to its vulnerability, unable to pursue cases and susceptible to threats and intimidation. 
Gul Rehman, a lawyer, concurred with Mr Kamal. He said that in most cases, police fail to lodge proper FIRs. Then there are issues with investigations and collection of evidence. He recalled that in the murder of Alisha, a highly publicised case that had sparked a public outcry in 2016, the killer simply walked away from the Peshawar High Court due to clerical mistakes made by the police. 
“Police said they had recovered the weapon on the 29th of the month, while records showed that the weapon was sent to the police forensic lab on the 25th,” he said. Perhaps it was divine retribution that the murderer met his demise six months after his release, the lawyer said. 
Arzoo Khan, a trans community representative, said the community is constrained while pursuing murder cases. For example, in many cases, parents compromise with the killer to pocket the diyat settlement. “Those who do not consider us as their own when we are alive should not be allowed to benefit from our death either,” Arzoo complained. 
Dr Anoosh Khan, chair of the Gender Studies department at the University of Peshawar, regretted the lack of recognition of deviant sexualities in our culture. “So is the case with transgender persons, unfortunately. Once we consider them human beings, maybe the situation might change.” 
She did not sound too optimistic, however. “[After all], we are still striving for [the basic rights of] women,” she wryly said. She believed the murders can only be stopped if the perpetrators are punished. 
Peshawar Police Superintendent (SP City) Atiq Shah said that they have set up a committee comprising police officers, representatives of the transgender community and local elders to resolve issues faced by the transgender community. He is a member of the committee. 
Mr Shah said that they have also included transgender persons in the police’s Dispute Resolution Committee for the redressal of their problems. 
However, he said, considering that the accused in the murder of Mano was someone close to her, police cannot provide armed security to every trans person to prevent a murder from happening again. 
Ayesha Gul, AIG Gender Equality with KP Police, told Dawn that the police reaction after attacks on trans persons matters. She said that police were working on the collection of data of attacks on transgender persons. 
“Figures for the Swat district show that there were 12 different incidents of violence against transgender persons in that district,” she said. Four of these cases ended in compromise, while in at least 10 of the cases the victim and the suspect had known each other. 
“There is so much scrutiny of police from the mainstream as well as social media that there is no question of cops not taking action on such cases,” Ms Gul said.
