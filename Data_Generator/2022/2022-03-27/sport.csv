0,‘Bittersweet’ as NZ beat Pakistan but exit Women’s World Cup,"""We’re gutted that we’re not moving forward in this tournament,"" says captain Sophie Devine.","CHRISTCHURCH: Century-maker Suzie Bates produced a milestone innings as New Zealand beat Pakistan by 71 runs in the Women’s World Cup in Christchurch on Saturday.
It was the final match of the tournament for both sides, and although New Zealand hold a mathematical chance of making the semi-finals, captain Sophie Devine said that was most unlikely and it was a  “bittersweet” win to bow out on.
“Absolutely, we’re gutted that we’re not moving forward in this tournament and I want to wish those teams that do manage to go through all the best,” she said.
The tournament hosts posted 266 for eight with Bates scoring 126 before Hannah Rowe took five for 55 to restrict Pakistan to 194 for nine.
It lifted New Zealand to six points, equal with fourth-placed England and India who each have a superior run rate and a game in hand which sees them both threaten to overtake third-placed West Indies -- who are one point ahead but have completed their matches.
At a crowded Hagley Oval, on New Zealand’s first day without Covid-enforced outdoor spectator restrictions, Bates contributed nearly half the New Zealand total and along the way became only the fourth player in women’s cricket to reach 5,000 ODI runs.
Bates also became the first person to score a century in four consecutive World Cup tournaments but believed her player-of-the-match award should have gone to Rowe.
“I just really wanted to take the game deep and make sure we finished off the 50 overs and got a good score on the board,” she said.
“It’s a nice record to have but I thought Hannah Rowe, I could share this player of the match with because she bowled outstandingly.”
Bates was given out lbw on 17 and deliberated on the dismissal until the final second before seeking a review which confirmed the ball was missing leg-stump.
When the opener was eventually dismissed, bowled by Nashra Sandhu in the 43rd over, she received a standing ovation as she walked from the field and New Zealand were well placed at 211 for five with more than seven overs remaining.
But instead of New Zealand pushing up the run rate, Pakistan took the initiative with four wickets for 20 runs before Katey Martin and Frankie Mackay plundered 32 off the final two overs.
Martin finished unbeaten on 30 with 22 of her runs coming off eight deliveries in the final flurry.
The star performer with the ball for Pakistan was Nida Dar, with the spinner taking three for 39 from her 10 overs.
Dar then top-scored for Pakistan with 50 while captain Bismah Maroof contributed 38 but the side were behind the required run rate throughout, and after reaching three for 155 Pakistan added only 39 more runs and lost six wickets.
Summarised scores:
New Zealand beat Pakistan by 71 runs.
NEW ZEALAND 265-8 in 50 overs (S.  Bates 126, K. Martin 30n.o.; Dar 3-39); PAKISTAN 194-9 in 50 overs (N.  Dar 50, B. Maroof 38; Rowe 5-55).

1,Injured Smith ruled out of Pakistan white-ball games,LAHORE: Senior batter Steve Smith has been ruled out of Australia’s upcoming limited-overs matches with Pakistan...,"LAHORE: Senior batter Steve Smith has been ruled out of Australia’s upcoming limited-overs matches with Pakistan due to a recurrence of a left elbow injury, Cricket Australia (CA) said on Saturday.
The 32-year-old became the fastest batter to complete 8,000 runs during the final Test in Lahore that Australia won by 115 runs to clinch the series 1-0 on Friday.
The first two Tests — in Rawalpindi and Karachi — ended in draws.
Smith said he was disappointed not to be part of the One-day International series starting in Lahore from Tuesday.
“It’s disappointing to miss these matches against Pakistan but after chatting with the medical staff I can see the need to take a break at this time,” Smith was quoted saying in a CA release.
“I do not regard this as a major issue but by staying on top of things now, we can ensure that it doesn’t become something more significant further down the line.” Australia’s selectors named leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson as Smith’s replacement.
The second ODI is on Thursday and the third on Saturday followed by one T20 International on April 5 -- with all matches in Lahore.
Smith will return home alongside Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc and David Warner later Saturday.
‘PAKISTAN A GOOD PLACE FOR CRICKET’
Meanwhile, Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh said Pakistan is a good place for cricket, adding there should be more international cricket in the country.
“In Pakistan there should be more international cricket as it is a good place for cricket,” the 30-year-old Marsh said during an online media conference on Saturday.
Praising the passion of Pakistani people for cricket, he said Pakistani people are very good and so is the Pakistan cricket team.
“We are being taken good care of, he said. “After our Test series victory everyone celebrated dinner yesterday, we had dinner together, and had a lot of fun and now everyone is fresh,” he said.
Terming Australia’s Test series victory against Babar Azam and his men a great success, he said there would be tours of sub-continent in future as well and the win in Pakistan would help them a lot.
He said now the focus will be on white-ball series, comprising three One-day Internationals and one T20, starting on March 29 in Lahore.
“I think that the ODI series will be as good as the Test series. The Test series was played in good spirit and now this series [white ball series] will also be excellent,” he asserted.
The all-rounder said:  “I got a break before the white-ball series which would be to my advantage.
“I spent time with my family before the series and then prepared for the White Ball series.
On Smith’s missing the limited-overs matches in Pakistan due to injury, Marsh said,”not having a player like Steve Smith means your experienced player is lost”.
He described Pakistan’s white-ball team very good but said the touring team have the opportunity to perform well.
“Australia have a new [white-ball] team while the Pakistan team is experienced,” Marsh said while hoping that the matches in Lahore would be high-scoring affairs.
Revised ODI squad: Aaron Finch (captain), Sean Abbott, Ashton Agar, Jason Behrendorff, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Marnus Labuschagne, Mitchell Marsh, Ben McDermott, Marcus Stoinis, Mitchell Swepson, Adam Zampa.

2,Italy FA president backs Mancini to stay,ROME: Italian Football Federation (FIGC) president Gabriele Gravina has backed coach Roberto Mancini to continue in...,"ROME: Italian Football Federation (FIGC) president Gabriele Gravina has backed coach Roberto Mancini to continue in his role despite the team failing to qualify for this year’s World Cup in Qatar.
Italy, which did not qualify for the 2018 World Cup, missed out on football’s global showpiece again after they suffered a 1-0 defeat at home to North Macedonia in Thursday’s playoff semi-final.
Since lifting their fourth World Cup trophy in 2006, Italy have not played a knockout game in the World Cup, having only won one group stage match at the finals in that time.
“I hope Mancini continues with us,” Gravina said. “He has a commitment with us for this project. I hope he can shake off this elimination just like all the Italians and that he remains at the helm to continue our work together.”
The Azzurri were feted as national heroes after they won the European Championship in July 2021 but the team have crashed back to earth after missing out on the World Cup finals for the second time running.
“Just as we accepted the praise last summer, we must accept the criticism coming our way, but I must try to protect this national team,” Gravina added.
“We go forward with heads held high. We must not lose the enthusiasm of last summer... Criticism is fine, but we don’t want the risk of doing even more damage.”
Later on Saturday, Mancini said that Italy  must focus squarely on the future after they  failed to  qualify for the World Cup for the second time in a row, leading to  speculation over Mancini’s own future as coach.
After the last World Cup debacle, Italy laid  the blame on team coach Gian Piero Ventura and soccer federation chief  Carlo Tavecchio, both of whom resigned shortly afterwards.
This  time around there were no calls for the removal of Mancini, however,  with Gravina  backing him.
“The only right move now is to raise our heads and work for the future,” Mancini wrote on Instagram.
“Let’s  take some time to reflect and understand clearly.”
Italy next face  Turkey, who were knocked out of World Cup qualifying by Portugal, in a  friendly game on March 29.

3,Leclerc tops Saudi Arabian GP practice after drivers agree to race,Leclerc clocked a best lap of one minute and 29.735 seconds to beat world champion Max Verstappen by 0.033 seconds.,"JEDDAH: Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc outpaced world champion Max Verstappen with a late flying lap in Saturday’s final Saudi Arabian Grand Prix practice after drivers agreed to carry on despite an attack on a nearby oil facility.
None of the drivers appeared to be the worse for wear despite lengthy debates overnight about racing in the aftermath of Friday’s missile strike by Yemen’s Huthi rebels om the Aramco fuel plant, which ignited a blaze with black smoke billowing across the Formula One track.
Leclerc, winner of last weekend’s season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix, clocked a best lap of one minute and 29.735 seconds to beat the Dutchman by 0.033 seconds.
Verstappen’s Red Bull team-mate Sergio Perez was third, just 0.098 behind, ahead of Carlos Sainz in the second Ferrari and Valtteri Bottas, who was sixth for Alfa Romeo.
Defending champion Verstappen dominated most of the session, but made two errors on his final laps, once clipping a wall before bouncing heavily over a kerb, as he succumbed to over-aggression on the high-speed street track.
In a generally calm session, Esteban Ocon was sixth for Alpine ahead of Pierre Gasly of Alpha Tauri, Kevin Magnussen of Haas, Fernando Alonso in the second Alpine and Yuki Tsunoda of Alpha Tauri.
Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton struggled again in his Mercedes and wound up 11th with team-mate George Russell 14th as they battled the ‘bouncing’ again.
On another warm day at the Jeddah Street Circuit, following a short night after four-hour talks between drivers, teams and organisers, Bottas was the first man on track for final free practice.
The Finn, now with Alfa Romeo after leaving Mercedes, has exuded a new-found enthusiasm this season and was soon lapping quickly, but not rapidly enough to outpace the Ferraris of Leclerc and Sainz.
Team principals, race organisers, Formula One and the ruling body, the FIA, had said they had reached a unanimous agreement for the show to go on, in less than an hour, but it took much longer to convince the drivers.
After around three and a half hours of further talks, they agreed to race.
In a statement on their behalf, the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association (GPDA) said  “natural human concerns” had caused many to have doubts about taking part.
This was confirmed on Saturday morning by Ferrari team chief Mattia Binotto who admitted,  “I don’t think we can say that they are 100 per cent happy and fully relaxed.
“I think they are still concerned, but they are listening to the assurances that we give them, the understanding of the importance to stay here and somehow try to race because it’s the best choice we can do.
“After that long discussion, [which] it was important to have, they simply understood and supported that it was important to stay and remain and continue the weekend and drive here in Saudi.
“By leaving the country, it would not have been simply the right choice and there were no right reasons to leave here, to leave the country after all the assurances we had got.
“I think they met. They had their own concerns and raised them, but all together we tried to get the assurances and got the right explanation as well.”
Aston Martin team boss Mike Krack added that the Saudi authorities and security had helped convince drivers  “that everything would be safe and under control”.
In a joint statement, F1 and the FIA confirmed they had received  “detailed assurances that the event is secure.” Binotto added:  “It was a long night, but first, let’s focus on the facts.
It is never great to see what has happened, but we know that it is not the first time it has happened in this country or in this area.
“If there is any reason why we are here it is to get [across] a positive message and that is our duty. It is our task and by being here it is what we need to really try to do.”

4,‘Perry could play as batter only in World Cup semi-final’w,WELLINGTON: Australia all-rounder Ellyse Perry could play as a batter only in their Women’s World Cup semi-final...,"WELLINGTON: Australia all-rounder Ellyse Perry could play as a batter only in their Women’s World Cup semi-final next week if she fails to fully recover from a back injury, coach Matthew Mott said on Saturday.
Perry, who is a key player of the Australian team, was off the field for most of their group stage win over South Africa on Tuesday after suffering a back spasm. She also missed Friday’s win over Bangladesh.
Australia finished the group stage on top with an unbeaten record and will play their semi-final on either Wednesday or Thursday, with their opponents yet to be decided.
“She’ll have to get through a battery of tests, with this return-to-play protocol that she’ll have to meet, she’ll have to meet some certain criteria and be able to perform close to her best,” Mott said.
“It wouldn’t be ideal, but she would definitely be considered as a batter alone. It does throw up different selection conundrums.
“...But all things considered, it’s looking quite positive she’d had a really good break, we’ve been quite conservative in her management, so we’re confident with the extra couple of days that gives her time to be ready.”
Australia have won the 50-over Women’s World Cup a record six times.

5,Da Silva steers WI into narrow lead against England in series decider,The West Indian version of tail-end resistance saw 137 runs added for the loss of two wickets.,"ST GEORGE’S: Joshua da Silva’s unbeaten maiden Test half-century in the Caribbean anchored a West Indies lower-order revival which pushed the home side ahead of England on the second day of the third and final Test on Friday.
Replying to the tourists’ first innings total of 204, da Silva’s unbeaten 54 and vital contributions from Kyle Mayers, Alzarri Joseph and Kemar Roach lifted the home side from the depths of 95 for six to 232 for eight at stumps.
While not nearly as dramatic as the last-wicket stand of 90 between Saqib Mahmood and Jack Leach on day one which resuscitated the English from 114 for nine, the West Indian version of tail-end resistance saw 137 runs added for the loss of two wickets.
In stark contrast to the dreary cricket which defined most of the drawn first two matches, da Silva (54 not out) and Roach (25 not out) will be keen to extend a ninth-wicket stand on the third morning which has already produced 55 runs and earned the home team a lead of 28 runs with two wickets in hand.
Chris Woakes led the England effort with the ball, taking three wickets in mid-afternoon to trigger a West Indies slide which seemed terminal until da Silva joined Mayers.
Successive partnerships of 33 with Mayers, 49 with Joseph (28) and the unbroken stand with Roach followed, the ninth-wicket pair unperturbed by the arrival of the second new ball half-hour before the close of play.
Da Silva’s half-century, his fourth overall in Test cricket, has occupied more than three hours in which he faced 152 deliveries, stroking four fours.
“My home form hasn’t been very good so it was especially pleasing to get runs in from of home support,” said de Silva.
“I have complete faith in the guys in the lower-order and they even outshone me this evening. We’ll be looking to extend it as far as we can tomorrow because Jayden [Seales] can bat as well and we want to have some runs to work with in the second innings.”
Under pressure to prove his Test match value outside of England, Woakes extracted disconcerting bounce in the post-lunch period to account for Nkrumah Bonner and Jason Holder in the space of four balls before removing Jermaine Blackwood with a full-length delivery.
It was at that point -- 95 for six -- when da Silva entered the proceedings and while Mayers (28) took the limelight in their brief stand before he fell to Ben Stokes, the wicketkeeper-batsman displayed the calmness and maturity which has become a feature of his play since his Test debut in New Zealand at the end of 2020.

Salah’s early shot in Cairo cannoned off the crossbar, hit Senegal defender Saliou Ciss and went in to give Egypt a slim advantage over the newly crowned African champions to take to the second leg in Senegal on Tuesday. 
The Salah-Mane international rivalry continued six weeks after the Liverpool team-mates met in the final of the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Then, Mane hit the winning penalty in a shootout to give Senegal their first major title as Salah watched on helpless. 
Egypt started the playoff at breakneck speed at Cairo International Stadium and the own goal from Ciss came in the fourth minute. Salah sprinted away after it went in and was mobbed in celebration by just about every player from the Egypt bench. 
There was redemption of sorts for Algeria, too. 
The Algerians returned to the same stadium where they were dumped out of the African Cup in the group stage as defending champions to clinch a crucial 1-0 away win over Cameroon in the first leg of their playoff. 
Striker Islam Slimani scored with a header in the first half at Japoma Stadium in Douala, justifying his promotion to the starting lineup. Cameroon goalkeeper Andr Onana got a hand to the header but pushed it only onto the crossbar and watched the ball drop into the goal behind him. 
Cameroon were playing their first game under new coach and former national captain Rigobert Song, who was brought in to replace Toni Conceicao despite Conceicao leading Cameroon to a fairly impressive third place at the African Cup. 
The debut didn’t go according to plan for Song, and Cameroon must come from behind in the second leg in Blida to reach the World Cup in Qatar and extend their African record to eight World Cup appearances. Algeria hardly ever lose at home. 
The playoffs will decide the five African teams to play at the World Cup in Qatar and could erase those painful African Cup memories for Egypt and Algeria. 
Nigeria had to settle for a 0-0 draw in Ghana after VAR overruled a decision to award the visitors a late penalty. A review found that Ghana midfielder Iddrisu Baba was fouled before he handled. 
Ghana came closest to breaking the deadlock with Nigerian goalkeeper Francis Uzoho pulling off a superb save to deny Fatahu Ishaku in the first half. 
Tunisia claimed a crucial 1-0 away win over Mali in scorching hot Bamako to give it the advantage in their tie. 
That victory came largely thanks to a dire personal performance from Mali defender Moussa Sissako, who gave Tunisia their winner with a calamitous own goal in the 36th minute. Sissako’s attempted pass back was nowhere near goalkeeper Ibrahim Mounkoro and bounced over the goal-line as Sissako watched his error with hands on head. 
Sissako then made Mali’s task almost impossible when he was sent off four minutes later. 
Tarik Tissoudali scored a brilliant equaliser as Morocco moved closer to a sixth World Cup appearance by drawing 1-1 with the Democratic Republic of Congo in Kinshasa. 
A move that began with a superb slide tackle by Moroccan defender Romain Saiss ended with Tissoudali rifling the ball into the net on 76 minutes. 
Yoane Wissa had given DR Congo a 12th-minute lead, sprinting down the wing, cutting inside and unleashing a shot from just outside the box that brushed Saiss and beat goalkeeper Yassine Bounou. 
With away goals counting double if teams tie on aggregate, a 0-0 draw in Casablanca would take Morocco to Qatar.

10,Messi ponders future after Argentina down Venezuela,BUENOS AIRES: Lionel Messi says he will reconsider his future in football later this year but said it’s likely...,"BUENOS AIRES: Lionel Messi says he will reconsider his future in football later this year but said it’s likely “many things will change” after the World Cup in November and December in Qatar.
Messi’s comments came after Argentina beat Venezuela 3-0 on Friday in the remaining match of the penultimate round of South American World Cup qualifying.
“I don’t know what I will do after the World Cup. I am thinking about what is coming,” Messi said. “After Qatar I will have to reassess many things.”
He added his doubts had nothing to do with past frustration playing for Argentina. He won his first title with the team last year the Copa America in a final against Brazil.
“It has been a while that I am happy here, since before winning the Copa. I am thankful for all this they make me feel every time I come to Argentina,” Messi said.
Asked about him continuing with the national team after Qatar, Messi, who turns 35 in June, said: “I don’t know, the truth is I don’t know. I think about that is coming, which is close, Ecuador [on Tuesday]. The preparation matches in June and September. Let’s hope these go the best way possible. But for sure after the World Cup many things will change.”
Messi, who was recently booed by Paris St Germain fans, appeared pleased after scoring the third goal of the match and receiving enthusiastic support from the spectators at the La Bombonera Stadium.
Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador and Uruguay have already secured the region’s four direct spots in Qatar later this year. Peru (21 points), Colombia (20) and Chile (19) will play in the last round on Tuesday for fifth place, which qualifies for an international playoff with an Asian team.
Argentina opened the scoring with Nico Gonzalez from close range in the 35th minute after a low cross by Rodrigo de Paul. Angel di Maria, another player who is under fire in France, netted the second in the 79th minute, lobbing the Venezuelan goalkeeper after an assist by De Paul.

MIAMI: Iga Swiatek started her week by deciding that she wanted to set her sights on becoming the No. 1 player in the world, without knowing how long that quest would take.
A few days and one surprising retirement later, mission accomplished.
Women’s tennis has a new name atop its rankings, a 20-year-old who now that Ashleigh Barty has retired and asked to vacate her No. 1 spot on the world list becomes the first Polish player to hold that distinction. Swiatek’s ascension was clinched on Friday night with a 6-2, 6-0 win over Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland in the second round of the Miami Open.
When the tournament ends and the rankings are updated on April 4, Barty will be removed and Swiatek officially will move into the top spot no matter what happens the rest of the way in Miami.
“I’m really satisfied and really proud of myself,” Swiatek said.
Swiatek becomes the 28th different woman to hold the No. 1 ranking since the computerised system debuted in November 1975. Her rise has been steady and constant; she ended 2016 ranked No. 903, cracked the top 500 for the first time in 2018, ended 2020 ranked No. 17, then was No. 9 when last year ended.
Barty revealed her retirement decision on Wednesday, and as part of that said she wanted to be removed from the rankings. She’s held the top spot since November 2019 and would have kept the top spot after this tournament ended even if Swiatek won the title.
But her decision to retire and step out of the rankings opened the door for either Swiatek or Paula Badosa, the No. 5 seed in Miami and the only other person who had a mathematical chance of getting the top spot. Badosa won her second-rounder in Miami on Friday, topping Marie Bouzkova 7-5, 7-5.
Coco Gauff, the 14th-seeded American, got past Wang Qiang of China 7-5, 6-4 on Friday avenging a first-round loss to her in the Australian Open earlier this year.
No. 16 Jessica Pegula felt right at home too, even though the tournament is held on the grounds where the NFL’s Miami Dolphins practice and play and her parents, Terry and Kim Pegula, just happen to own the Dolphins’ AFC East rival Buffalo Bills. Pegula had little trouble beating 2018 Miami Open winner Sloane Stephens 6-1, 6-4.
No. 4 Maria Sakkari, No. 10 Jelena Ostapenko, No. 20 Elise Mertens, No. 24 Sorana Cirstea, No. 26 Madison Keys and No. 29 Liudmila Samsonova all lost second-round matches on Friday.
Shelby Rogers of the US used 15 aces and saved nine of the 10 break points she faced to beat Ostapenko, 6-3, 7-6 (0). It was Rogers’ second win over Ostapenko this month, after also topping her in a second-round match-up at Indian Wells.
There are no easy matches out here, Rogers said.
Beatriz Haddad Maia topped Sakkari 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. Madison Brengle of the US beat Samsonova 6-4, 6-0. Chinas Zhang Shuai needed only 53 minutes to beat Cirstea, 6-1, 6-1. Linda Fruhvirtova topped Mertens 7-5, 2-6, 6-1.
Other seeded second-round women’s winners on Friday included No. 17 Elena Rybakina, No. 21 Veronika Kudermetova and No. 28 Petra Kvitova.
In men’s second-round play, No. 16 Reilly Opelka retired from his match against Argentina’s Francisco Cerundolo with a shoulder injury, and Hugo Gaston knocked out No. 20 John Isner of the US 7-6 (5), 6-4.
No. 2 seed Alexander Zverev was tested but topped 166th-ranked Borna Coric 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, and said getting more aggressive as the match went along was key.
Fan favourite Nick Kyrgios rolled past No. 5 Andrey Rublev 6-3, 6-0, and No. 9 Jannik Sinner held off Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (8).
No. 6 Casper Ruud, No. 10 Cameron Norrie, No. 17 Pablo Carreno Busta, No. 22 Gael Monfils, No. 28 Frances Tiafoe, No. 30 Alexander Bublik and No. 31 Fabio Fognini were all winners, but No. 13 Diego Schwartzman lost to Thanasi Kokkinakis and No. 19 Lorenzo Sonego of Italy lost to Denis Kudla of the US.
Mackenzie McDonald of the US also pulled off a mild upset, topping No. 26 Grigor Dimitrov 6-1, 6-4.
