ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Expressing his gratitude to the nation for what he called “foiling an international conspiracy” by supporting his candidate, Parvez Elahi, in the recent Punjab chief minister’s election, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chair­man Imran Khan on Wedne­sday ruled out any possibility of sitting down for talks with the ruling coalition.
“I can talk to the [Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan], the separatists of Balochistan and Sindh, but not with thieves. Will you speak to someone who robs your home?” he said in his address on Wednesday night, which was being celebrated as a ‘thanksgiving day’ on the call of his party.

“Throughout my life, I have witnessed such enthusiasm only once before, and that was during the 1965 war; at that time, everybody thought that the nation was fighting. And now, I saw the same enthusiasm among the masses during the by-polls in the 20 constituencies of Punjab,” he said.
Insisting that he wanted good relations, even with US — which he accuses of trying to engineer his ouster from power through a conspiracy — but urged the nation to prefer “death to slavery”.
“I do not want bad relations with the US, where we export more than any other country and where a large number of the Pakistani community resides. But death is better than slavery and we have to live with self-respect,” he added.
Saying that general elections were the sole solution to the prevailing crises facing the country, brought on by the ineptitude of the government that was imposed on the nation through foreign conspiracy, Mr Khan vowed that once he comes into power again, he would put the country on its own feet and would only ask overseas Pakistanis and not the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial assistance.
In his remarks, which sounded like an early election speech, Mr Khan once again expressed a complete lack of trust in the incumbent Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja. He continued to allege that Mr Raja was involved in rigging in the recent by-elections for 20 seats of the provincial assembly, where his party won the bulk of seats.
During his speech, he also vowed to resume the Sehat Card and Ehsas Ration—two flagship schemes launched by his previous regime in the province, upon his return to power.
The PTI chairman’s pledge to resume two major schemes in Punjab seemed to negate the impression that he may seek to dissolve the assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where the party is currently ruling, to pressurise the federal government to step down and announce general elections.
The former prime minister, while commenting on recent decision of the Supreme Court that made Pervez Elahi chief minister Punjab and nullified the victory of Hamza Sharif in the recent election for the slot, said it was clear in the Constitution that the parliamentary leader, not the party head, could decide which side the party will vote for in the polls.
“But leaders of the ruling coalition bashed institutions and the judiciary when the decision came against them,” he said.
LHC moved against PM
In a major move against the ruling coalition in the centre, the PTI has filed a petition in the Lahore High Court seeking the disqualification of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan.
PTI’s former lawmaker Andleeb Abbas and Advocate Hassaan Khan Niazi jointly filed the petition saying the prime minister misused his powers and violated the Constitution by allowing his son Suleman and nephew Hussain Nawaz, both are proclaimed offenders, to meet Saudi crown prince during an official visit.
The petitioners further stated that the prime minister took his cabinet members to London to meet former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and former finance minister Ishaq Dar, both proclaimed offenders before the courts of the country.
They asked the court to disqualify the respondents and also direct the police to initiate criminal proceedings against the PM and his cabinet members.

1,Interior minister threatens Punjab with governor’s rule,• Sana holds SC verdict responsible for ‘destabilising political situation’ • Says Nawaz will return to lead campaign once polls,"• Sana holds SC verdict responsible for ‘destabilising political situation’
• Says Nawaz will return to lead campaign once polls announced
• PTI says public anger on governor’s rule will be ‘unbearable’
ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah on Wednesday warned that the federal government could impose governor’s rule in Punjab if the provincial government led by Chief Minister Parvez Elahi — an ally of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) — tried to block his entry to the province.
The statement by the interior minister prompted a strong response from the PTI, which met under the chairmanship of its chairman Imran Khan to restore welfare projects the party had initiated during Usman Buzdar’s tenure.
Mr Sanaullah was alluding to the remarks made by PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry last week wherein the former information minister had said that entry of PML-N leaders, including Attaullah Tarar, would be banned in Punjab if PTI came to power.
In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr Sanaullah said if the Punjab government tried to ban the entry of PML-N leaders, such an action would provide a “strong ground” for the imposition of governor’s rule.
He said he had already begun drafting a summary for the imposition of governor’s rule, which was moved by the interior ministry, because of the kind of statements opposition leaders had been making.
The minister said the president would be bound to accept the advice of the prime minister on the governor’s rule. “Otherwise, it would be deemed to have been accepted after 10 days,” he remarked.
He also shed light on the deteriorating economic situation in the country due to political instability and said that the ongoing turmoil was a matter of concern as the dollar continued to “take giant leaps against the Pakistani currency”.
‘SC verdict aggravated crises’
Mr Sanaullah said the Supreme Court’s verdict would further deepen political and economic crises as it “created complications and destabilised the political situation”.
Even a second-grader would interpret Article 63-A — which is related to the disqualification of lawmakers over defection — as saying that the votes of dissident lawmakers would be counted in the election, he claimed.
He further stated that the SC’s recent verdict contradicted the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to de-seat 25 dissident PTI lawmakers who had voted for Hamza in the April 16 election, which was, in turn, based on an order of the apex court.
The ECP’s verdict had been based on MPAs not following the instructions of the party head, whereas the SC had stated the parliamentary party head’s instructions should be followed, he stated.
He went on to say that Hamza should have remained the chief minister had the votes of 25 dissident lawmakers not been subtracted from his tally in the April election.
“It is my opinion that the interpretation of Article 63-A will not sustain. Any lawyer will say it amounts to rewriting the Constitution. It is not the SC’s authority to rewrite the Constitution and we will defend parliament’s authority,” Mr Sanaullah said.
“This situation is unfortunate and we want to restrict our words [...] an independent, uncontroversial and impartial judiciary is any country’s basic need. No country can progress without it.”
‘Regulate judiciary’
The interior minister said that the incumbent government did not seek to curb the judiciary’s authority but wanted to “regulate” it. “No one is talking of limiting its authority”, he said.
He also said had the chief justice formed benches in consultation with fellow judges, letters like the one circulating since Tuesday would have never surfaced. He was referring to the one written by Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan.
In response to a question about whether the PML-N-led coalition government in the Centre would find it difficult to rule now that they no longer had control of Punjab, Sanaullah said: “The federal government has its own role. It is present everywhere. It has so many departments and its resources and budgets are bigger than provincial departments.”
In response to a question on what the government would do if PTI Chairman Imran Khan decided to hold another long march to Islamabad, Sanaullah said they should remember the incidents of May 25 — the last time the former ruling party had gone on a long march to the capital, which was marked by violence.
He said a protest march, if it started from Punjab or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, will be stopped there and then. “If the police do not stop them, we will do it ourselves. They should not think they will find empty roads… towards Islamabad.”
Mr Sanaullah claimed that PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif will return to Pakistan to lead the election campaign once the general elections were called.
PTI Core Committee
In response to the threat made by Mr Sanaullah, the PTI warned that those who were talking about the imposition of the governor’s rule in Punjab should bear in mind that they must be ready to face the public’s wrath.
The core committee of the PTI had met with Imran Khan in the chair. He decided to restore public welfare projects in Punjab and also nominated Sabtain Khan for the speaker of the Punjab Assembly slot left vacant after Mr Elahi became the CM.
Speaking to the media in Banigala after the meeting, PTI leader Farrukh Habib warned that in case of governor’s rule, the wrath of the public will be “unbearable”.
While sharing details from the core committee meeting, he said Imran Khan had directed the immediate restoration of the health card, the Ehsas programme, shelters for the homeless, and other welfare works in Punjab province.
He added that Mr Khan would visit Lahore today to take important decisions pertaining to the newly-elected government in Punjab. He said that the PTI chief was “concerned” about the masses therefore he directed the Elahi-led government to restore public welfare projects.

2,NA seeks judicial reforms to counter ‘double standards’,"PM laments Imran still ‘blue-eyed’, getting unprecedented support from institutions; Bilawal says 19th Amendment should have never","

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif listens as  Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari shares his thoughts during the National Assembly session on Wednesday.—Tanveer Shahzad / White Star

 
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on Wednesday seeking the formation of a special parliamentary committee to carry out judicial reforms after heads of the ruling coalition parties, including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, launched a tirade against the judiciary over Tuesday’s decision of a three-judge Supreme Court bench in the Punjab chief minister’s case.
The resolution was read out by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on the opening day of the assembly’s new session and was also supported by the small opposition in the house after Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in his hard-hitting speech held the judiciary responsible for the state of democracy in the country and accused it of validating all the military takeovers in the past.
The move seems to be an effort to put the judiciary under pressure as the ruling coalition does not have the two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament, which is required to amend the Constitution.
“This august house believes that the parliament is the supreme legislative body of the state … the enactment of the laws, including amendments to the Constitution, is the sole prerogative of the parliament,” said Mr Tarar while reading out the text of the resolution.

PM laments Imran still ‘blue-eyed’, getting unprecedented support from institutions; Bilawal says 19th Amendment should have never passed

In the beginning, he mistakenly read out “august court” and then explained it to the lawmakers amid huge laughter that he uttered these words as he had been doing so in the court as a lawyer for 40 years.
Through the resolution, the house declared the judicial reforms “a long pending agenda of what is left over from the Charter of Democracy” and vowed not to allow “any other institution to transgress and encroach on its powers”.
“This house resolves that to ensure the supremacy of the parliament and the Constitution in letter and spirit, it hereby constitutes a joint special committee of both houses to institute the requisite judicial reforms, which are the need of the hour,” the law minister said.
Earlier, Prime Minister Sharif accused the judiciary of having “double standards” in its treatment of different political parties.
The criticism of the judiciary came from the prime minister a day after the Supreme Court overruled a ruling by the Punjab Assembly’s deputy speaker and removed the premier’s son Hamza Shehbaz as the chief minister.
“I ask that there was a time when a former chief justice took suo moto [notices] day and night … when the courts summon then I think we should go with great respect … but if you have to decide then it should be on the basis of truth and justice. It can’t happen that you treat me one way and treat someone else differently,” Mr Sharif said, alleging that during the previous PTI government’s tenure, “no one took notice” of various scandals and corruption cases.
“Did anyone take a suo motu notice despite the passage of eight years?” he said while lamenting over the delay in the decision on the foreign funding case by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
Mr Sharif, who remained in the house almost during the whole proceedings, said despite the mammoth economic challenges prevailing at present, the government would help Pakistan emerge as a great country without bowing before “fascism”.
He claimed that Imran Khan was still “blue-eyed” and was getting unprecedented support from the institutions “despite failing to deliver”.
Taking the floor, Mr Bhutto-Zardari regretted that the Supreme Court refused to constitute a full court despite the demand of all the parties in parliament.
“We did not name any Mr X or Mr Y as an attempt to pressurise any institution. We did not threaten to divide Pakistan. When one institution was deciding regarding another, our only request was for the full court bench to be present,” he said.
He said just as the judiciary had decided that the prime minister would need the approval of the cabinet, in the same way, “the Supreme Court is not just the chief justice of Pakistan, it is each and every member of the SC.”
The PPP chairman said they had removed Article 58(2b) from the Constitution, which provided unbridled powers to the president to dissolve the assembly but regretted that now this power was with the court.
He also lambasted the former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and accused him of making decisions against the parliament and democracy, lamenting that even “the prices of samosas and potatoes were set in Court Room 1”.
Referring to the Charter of Democracy signed by former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif in 2006 in London, he said the promised judicial reforms revolved around the formation of constitutional courts that were to decide regarding the constitution and the appointment of judges, which would not be in the hands of a judge but of the house.
“We made an amendment in which the house along with judicial representatives would collectively appoint judges. The house, the PM and the law minister of the time were then threatened to pass the 19th Amendment or the 18th Amendment would be abolished,” he said. “I accept on the floor of the house that getting intimidated by the threat was our mistake. We should have never passed the 19th Amendment. We should have told the court of that time to go home if it did not accept the Constitution of Pakistan.”
Without naming, he alleged that during the 2018 elections, the role played by certain judges was apparent. Former Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, he alleged, was running a campaign against them as “he would make a speech against us in Larkana, slap a judge and give a lecture in Karachi”.
“It cannot happen that there is a different constitution for us and a different one for the laadla (blue-eyed),” he said, adding that it was the responsibility of the house to defend the role of parliament.
“It is not their [judges’] duty to amend the Constitution. It cannot happen that we sacrifice our lives, struggle for 30 years and then have someone change the Constitution with the stroke of a pen,” he said. “It is better to lock the parliament.”
Asad Mehmood of the JUI-F also lambasted the judiciary over its controversial decision on the issue of the Punjab chief minister, declaring that “enough is enough”.

4,"Situationer: Uncertainty, political leanings plague bureaucracy","Another spate of transfers, postings expected in the province following change in government.","The Punjab bureaucracy is under a cloud of uncertainty as most senior officers are apprehensive about their fates owing to the rapid changes in political governments, and have thus put decision-making on the backburner, eventually leaving the public to suffer.
A spate of transfers and postings is expected in the province following another change in the government, and Chaudhry Parvez Elahi positioning the “willing workers” in the bureaucracy to run the province’s affairs as per his vision after assuming the office of Punjab chief minister. These transfers and postings cost the government exchequer heavily.
Read more: Ruling Punjab
While there are bureaucrats who play smart and align themselves with every new political administration, there are some who have been exposed through their past record or decisions and actions made during the previous government’s short stint in power.
A new breed of officers also emerged in the past few years, who were accused of getting ‘lucrative postings’ by bribing the top officer in the chief executive’s secretariat. Then there’s also a whole lot of bureaucrats who are least concerned about political changes and are enjoying perks and privileges, without doing much.
While the bureaucracy is looking towards its new political bosses with fingers crossed for alignments best suited to the new government, the first posting against a top position has raised many eyebrows.
Chief Minister Elahi’s diehard loyalist Muhammad Khan Bhatti, who belongs to the Punjab Assembly service, was transferred and posted as the principal secretary to the CM even before Mr Elahi took oath of office from President Dr Arif Alvi at the Presidency at 2am on Wednesday. Mr Bhatti has neither undergone any top management training nor the bureaucratic system in vogue. “One can look at this posting differently on merit, but people are not surprised with it,” a senior bureaucrat told Dawn.
Punjab Chief Secretary Kamran Afzal, however, says Bhatti is a civil servant and it is the CM’s prerogative who he wants to post and where.
Mr Elahi had already expressed his annoyance at CS Kamran Ali Afzal and former police chief Rao Sardar Ali Khan over their action against PTI legislators and deploying the police force on the floor of the Punjab Assembly a few months ago. Former inspector general of police (IGP) Rao Sardar, however, managed to ‘escape’ after getting himself transferred to the federal government, while CS Afzal is still there and asserts he is performing his duties as a neutral civil servant.
After the three-and-a-half-year rule of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in the province, several bureaucrats were exposed when they acted out of loyalty to the PML-N government and were even accused as such by the PTI leadership, including its chairman Imran Khan.
The PTI chief, in his public meetings, had lambasted the CS, IGP as well as commissioners and deputy commissioners — particularly those posted in Lahore and Layyah in the wake of the PTI’s long march on Islamabad on May 25.
Several other officers are now looking for transfers out of the province to avoid being labeled ‘PML-N bureaucrats’ — a term that became a norm in Punjab over the last several years.
Senior bureaucrats say a good civil servant should not have political leanings and be ready to work with any government; those uncomfortable with a political administration should be ready to be sidelined. However, unfortunately, the officers agree civil servants were now more interested in developing political inclinations to get lucrative postings than functioning as neutral officers to serve the masses.
“There are some bureaucrats, who undermine all political bosses and take control of all the decisions – which is the worst situation, but in vogue,” an officer said.
“The issue of bureaucrats paying hefty amounts as bribes to get lucrative postings, and successive governments claiming to remove such officers is already in public domain,” a senior officer said.
Another officer regretted that around 80 per cent of the bureaucracy has become corrupt, and takes all the risks to commit corruption for itself , but wasn’t ready to take any risks for the government and the state.
In the Usman Buzdar government in Punjab, over 50 cabinet meetings were held with huge agendas to take financial and administrative decisions. “Many of those decisions should have been taken by the administrative secretaries but they preferred to get those approved from the cabinet to avert accountability,” a bureaucrat acknowledged. He also blames Imran Khan’s threats to the bureaucracy soon after forming the Punjab and federal governments in 2018 for keeping officers away from taking bold decisions.
A bureaucrat said the political inclinations of civil servants were limited to BS-21 and BS-22 officers in terms of postings until a few years ago, but unfortunately now the trend has trickled down to BS-17 officers.
“Now even newly inducted BS-17 officers need political leanings to get important postings,” the officer said, and added there was no merit in postings as good officers without ‘political connections’ continued to be shunned from good positions.
He says the bureaucracy is going through uncertainty and indecision, and functions only on court orders or instructions of the top bosses. “Routine work has been suspended and bureaucrats are busy discussing perks and privileges and commenting on ongoing transfers and postings,” the officer stated, adding eventually the public is suffering.
“I will have no problem with the government until I am enjoying an official residence, car, fuel and other privileges,” he remarked, adding “transfers also fetch me heavy extra bucks as TA, DA (travel allowance and daily allowance)”.
“Look at any bureaucrat and one can find his political leanings, postings and services rendered to particular political bosses,” the officer regretted.
