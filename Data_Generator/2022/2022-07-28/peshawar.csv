2,PHC rejects contempt plea against local govt secretary,"AG insists Mardan mayor not accepting office, vehicle given to him in line with court order...","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has rejected a petition seeking contempt proceedings against the local government secretary for not handing over office and official vehicle to Mardan city’s mayor despite the court’s order.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Shahid Khan turned down the plea of Mardan mayor Himayatullah Mayar after advocate general Shumail Ahmad Butt informed it that the petitioner had been provided with an office and official vehicle as directed by the court on March 17 but he was reluctant to accept them and wanted the office and vehicle used by the former district nazim.
The petitioner had claimed that moveable and immovable properties were required by the law to be handed over to the Mardan city government but that had so far not taken place.
“Under the law, the government is bound to order transferring of moveable and immovable properties, assets and staff of the former district governments to the respective tehsil governments,” he said.

AG insists Mardan mayor not accepting office, vehicle given to him in line with court order

Rejecting the petition, the bench observed that if the mayor had any dispute over provision of official vehicle or office, he could file another petition with it.
Local government secretary Zaheerul Islam and Mardan deputy commissioner Habibullah Arif also attended the hearing.
The petitioner’s counsel said in March this year, the high court had ordered the government to hand over assets of the former district governments to tehsil governments.
He said the provincial government had produced a notification claiming that all ‘assets’ of local councils had been handed over to the respective local governments, but the notification hadn’t been implemented.
The lawyer said the city council’s offices had been occupied by the district administration as well as the chairman of the district development advisory committee due to which the mayor had not been given his office.
He claimed that the vehicles, which should be in the possession of the mayor, had been given to the administrative officers.
The lawyer said under Section 121-A(1) of the KP Local Government Act, 2013, the petitioner was entitled to be handed over the movable and immovable properties, assets, staff, rights and liabilities of the then district government.
Advocate general Shumail Ahmad Butt and additional advocate general Babar Shehzad Imran rebutted his arguments contending that the court’s judgement had been fully implemented.
The AG said the petitioner had been provided with a Suzuki Vitara vehicle and an office but he was unhappy with it.
He added that the government had also offered him that an office would be setup for him on the same premises where he had been demanding, but he was adamant that he should be provided the office which was in use of the District Development Advisory Committee’s chairman.
Mr Butt said the petitioner wanted the vehicle and office given to the former district nazim.
He said there were several tehsil councils in Mardan, including the city council, and the properties of former district government had to be distributed among all tehsil councils.
The AG requested the bench to dismiss the petition as the respondents had not committed any contempt of this court.

PROTESTS THREATENED: Traders on Wednesday warned that they would begin street protests next week if the federal government didn’t order withdrawal ofa new surcharge from commercial power bills.
“At a time when we [traders] are doing business at a break-even point due to very high fuel and energy rates, the addition of Rs3,000-Rs20,000 to our power bills as a new surcharge is unacceptable. 
If it is not withdrawn, we will down shutters and take to the streets,” chairman of the central traders body Fayyaz Solaria told reporters. He insisted that traders were already overtaxed.
“We won’t pay additional surcharge and if the need arises, we will challenge it in the court of law,” he said.
Mr Solaria said the government should broaden tax net instead of imposing more taxes on traders.

They said that the 54 district organisers participated in the Tuesday’s meeting, but in fact the nominees of the influential leaders were selected in earlier meeting in Islamabad. 
The party sources said that as their names were announced some members endorsed them, while Shahram’s uncle Biland Iqbal stood and opposed the nominations. They said that at one point an eminent clash was averted with the separation of angry leaders.

7,Govt to set up five medical colleges under public-private partnership,Official says work to be initiated on project within two months.,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to establish five medical colleges under the public-private partnership programme in the province.
“The colleges would be established in Buner, Charsadda, Mansehra, Haripur and Karak as part of government’s plan to promote medical education in the province,” Health Secretary Amir Sultan Tareen told Dawn.
According to him, he has already visited three districts and would go to Karak this week on special directives of Chief Minister Mahmood Khan, who wants to him to submit a feasibility report within a month.
“We are working very quickly on the plan in collaboration with Khyber Medical University (KMU) as the government wants to establish these colleges as soon as possible. The project has been included in the Annual Development Programme,” he said.

Official says work to be initiated on project within two months

Mr Tareen said that KMU Vice-chancellor Prof Ziaul Haq in collaboration with the health department was working on the preparation of feasibility report. “We hope to start practical work on the project within next two months,” he added.
He said that health department was receiving demands for setting up medical colleges from the elected representatives of each and every district. He said that public sector medical colleges were facilitating most of the intelligent students and even students from the poor families could take admission there owing to lesser fee.
The fees in the private sector were very high and only public sector intuitions are ray of hope for the scions of downtrodden families to become medical doctors. “KMU has vast experience in medical education,” he said.
Mr Tareen said that chief minister had instructed them to complete the plan as early as possible. “There will be no delay as we are not going to hire consultants for feasibility but KMU is utilising its expertise and we would be able to advertise the establishment of the proposed colleges through public private partnership soon,” he added.
He said that they were also looking for the availability of 500-bed hospitals as per requirement of Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) for recognition of the colleges. He said in some districts, there were buildings that could house the colleges while in others plots were identified for construction of buildings.
KMU Vice-chancellor Prof Ziaul Haq said that on the instructions of chief ministers, the new medical colleges would be established in five districts to facilitate native population and improve patients’ care.
“There are 10 medical and five dental colleges in public sector and seven medical and three dental colleges in private sector in the province affiliated with KMU. The province has medical and as many dental colleges, which are not affiliated with us,” he said.
He said that he along with members of provincial assembly Ahmad Hussain Shan and Babar Saleem visited Mansehra on Tuesday and identified sites for Mansehra Medical College.
“Our team inspected Fatima Jinnah Public School for Girls and Elementary Teachers Training College and made a detailed review of various facilities available there. Various departments of King Abdullah Hospital were also inspected and found satisfactory to act as affiliated teaching hospital,” he said.
Prof Zia said that every medical college required a teaching hospital. “Therefore, we are seeing the available health facilities in the respective districts as well as buildings to house the colleges,” he added.
Officials at Health Foundation told Dawn that after completion of the feasibility, they would advertise to seek expression of interest from the private parties for setting up colleges and hospitals. The private parties work under the government to improve services.
They said that they had already contracted out 19 hospitals, which had shown better performance and plans were afoot to outsource 58 more health facilities within a month.

12,Acquisition of agricultural land in Charsadda for dumping site stayed,PHC issues notice to deputy commission seeking response to petition.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Wednesday issued a stay order temporarily stopping the Charsadda district administration from acquiring an agricultural land, mostly producing lotus root, to set up a dumping ground for waste.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khursheed Iqbal issued notice to Charsadda’s deputy commissioner seeking his response to a petition filed by a landlord, Mohammad Hashim Khan, against the invoking of Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act by the administration for acquiring his land in Charsadda city and converting it into a dumping site.
The petitioner requested the court to declare illegal a notification issued by the administration under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act for being a health and environmental issue in Majoki area, Charsadda, as well as adjoining areas.
He requested the court to declare the establishment of the dumping ground in Majoki area in violation of the Constitution and the provincial, federal and international environmental protection laws and standards.

High court seeks Charsadda admin’s reply to petition

The petitioner also highlighted the archaeological significance of lotus root for Charsadda district and sought the court’s orders for the government to hold regular research on its cultivation as well as help growers in that respect.
His lawyer, Ali Gohar Durrani, said lotus flower was a symbol of enlightenment and rebirth in Gandhara civilisation, while Charsadda was known as Pushkulavati (City of Lotus) in ancient times.
He said lotus root locally called nadru or barsanday was eaten as vegetable but The lawyer said the cultivation of lotus root dwindled and was confined to only three places, including Pajjagi area in Peshawar and Majoki and Turangzai areas in Charsadda.
He said a petition was recently filed with the high court, wherein the graveyard in Charsadda having been used as a dumping ground came into surface.
The counsel added that the court had issued orders in that case for the establishment of a proper dumping site.
He said the court had ordered the identification of site for the dumping site, while a committee was also constituted for the purpose.
Mr Durrani said a meeting was held on the matter and directions were issued to invoke Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act.
He said a survey was conducted and of all the places, the petitioner’s property, which was known for the cultivation of lotus root, had been chosen by the administration as the dumping site.
The lawyer argued that the local administration didn’t realise that it was an agricultural area, which was good for growing crops and if it was made a dumping site, it should have serious issues for environment, groundwater and the people’s health.
He contended that the notification was issued in haste ‘in the garb of the orders of the high court’.
Mr Durrani said a report of the sub-engineer of the tehsil municipal officer’s office declared that the site was located in the vicinity of a residential area and was waterlogged, so it was good for growing lotus root.

Addressing the oath-taking ceremony of Malakand District Bar Association in Batkhela, he said that the law introduced in Malakand division and tribal districts after their merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would not be revoked under any circumstances.
In the welcome address on the occasion, president of district bar Advocate Saeedullah said that efforts were underway to reverse the status of the former tribal areas of Malakand and Fata. He said that legal fraternity made immense sacrifices to mainstream the areas.
Formerly, Malakand was governed as Provincially Administered Tribal Area (Pata), an administrative subdivision of Pakistan designated in the Article 246(b) of the Const-itution of Pakistan. No Act of the provincial assembly could be applied to Pata whereas the governor of the province had the mandate parallel to the authority that the President of Pakistan had over Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).
Fata and Pata were merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2018 under 25th Amendment.
Addressing the ceremony, PHC Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid said that thousands of kanals of land was earmarked to establish court buildings and infrastructure to strengthen legal system in the newly merged areas.
“The provincial government wanted to build courts on 50 kanals of land. We said that the courts must be built on an area double of the size. The session court of Malakand is very small. The authorities need to arrange more than 100 kanals for the judicial complex,” he said.
He said the deputy commissioner of Malakand should not allow construction of buildings near Swat Motorway because it was agricultural land.
He said that in addition to the problems faced by lawyers and judges in the courts, an important stakeholder of the legal system were litigants. 
He said that addressing their issues should be the top priority of the legal system.
