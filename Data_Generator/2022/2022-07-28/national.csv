A joint meeting of the representatives of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC), the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and high court bar associations of all the provinces, provincial bar councils and members and nominees of the bar councils to the JCP expressed displeasure over appointing junior judges to the apex court as it violated the seniority principle.
A meeting presided over by SCBA President Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon and PBC Executive Committee Chairman Pir Muhammad Masood Chishti was called to consider the situation arising out of the controversies with regard to courts’ functioning and the appointment of judges.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, the judicial commission will consider elevating five high court judges to the Supreme Court, namely Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Justice Shahid Waheed; Peshawar High Court (PHC) Chief Justice Qaiser Rasheed Khan; and Sindh High Court’s (SHC) Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Naimatullah Phulpoto.

Hamid Khan censures JCP for ignoring Justice Minallah; SHCBA calls for strike

Justice Waheed is fourth in the LHC’s seniority list, whereas Justice Rizvi, Justice Siddiqui and Justice Phulpoto are fourth, sixth and seventh, respectively, in the SHC’s seniority line.
The Supreme Court is functioning with 13 judges against the sanctioned strength of 17, whereas the fifth vacancy will occur when Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, also a member of the JCP, retires on Aug 14.
That was the reason why senior puisne Sup­reme Court judge Justice Qazi Faez Isa in his July 26 letter to the CJP regretted that the anticipated vacancy would occur on the retirement of Justice Shah, but he was being called upon to choose his own successor.
“This is unconstitutional,” Justice Isa regretted, insisting that Pakistan was not a kingdom of yore in which kings decided their successors.
Speaking to Geo News, former SCBA president Hamid Khan called for the postponement of today’s JCP session and said ignoring senior judges was “extremely unfair”.
He was particularly critical of ignoring Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Athar Minallah’s elevation to the Supreme Court only because “some members and the chairman of the JCP disliked him (Justice Minallah)”. He said it was unfair also because the IHC already had no representation in the Supreme Court.
The PBC-SCBA joint session also reiterated its long-standing demand that the judicial commission should amend its rules to allow nominations for appointments to be initiated by any member of the commission rather than the chief justice alone.
The meeting also demanded that the federal government should immediately frame legislation in terms of articles 175(2) and 191 of the Constitution to regulate the manner of exercising the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction, especially to end the CJP’s sole discretion to form benches, fix cases and initiate suo motu proceedings, and vest the powers in a committee comprising five senior-most apex court judges.
SBC adopts resolution
In a related development, the Sindh Bar Council (SBC) wrote a letter to CJP Bandial and other JCP members and adopted a resolution urging that the upcoming meeting of the judicial commission be postponed and a fresh meeting be convened where only the senior-most judges are considered for appointment to the apex court.
The resolution also expressed serious reservations over the proposed names of high court judges floated before the JCP bypassing more senior judges.
It said the JCP meeting of July 28 had been convened in haste during the vacations when neither senior puisne judge Justice Isa nor Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf was available.
Separately, the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) also moved a resolution to call a strike today for ignoring the principle of seniority and failing to devise transparent criteria for appointing judges by the JCP.

He said more women as compared to the men were consistently being registered as voters as barriers in the way of female voters registration were dismantled and improved access given to them under a policy decision.
He was speaking as a keynote speaker at the event “Promotion and protection of women’s civil and political rights by individuals, governments and civil society”, organised by Aurat Foundation in Islamabad. Representatives from major political parties, human rights organisation, Aurat Foundation and different walks of life were also present.

Moreover, 66 women gender desks were to be established where gender gap was more than 10pc upon provision of system by the ECP and implementing partners, he added. One of the key tools to reduce gender gap was to make female officers in charge of the NRCs and 96pc NRCs had female staff, he said.
He said he had taken many a policy reforms regarding augmenting the women registration and unregistered citizens.

4,Govt adviser’s ‘disowned’ trip raises eyebrows in Washington,Expert says such ‘backtracking’ gives rise to questions about institutional cohesion in Pakistan.,"

WASHINGTON: Islamabad’s decision to send a prime ministerial advisor to the State Department to seek US support for its efforts to revive the economy, and then disown his visit as a “personal” one, has surprised many in Washington’s diplomatic circles.
Tariq Fatemi, who is currently serving as special assistant to the prime minister, arrived in the US capital last week and held brainstorming sessions with officials at the Pakistan embassy, including the ambassador.
On July 21, he met US Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman at her office and on the same day, Ms Sherman posted a brief message on her official Twitter: “I met with Special Assistant to the PM of Pakistan Ambassador Fatemi to reaffirm our shared goals of expanding relations through enhancing economic and commercial ties.”
She also wrote that the US was “looking forward to working together and celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations” between the two countries.

Expert says such ‘backtracking’ gives rise to questions about institutional cohesion in Pakistan

State Department spokesperson Ned Price confirmed the meeting as well, adding that talks focused on “coordination on Afghanistan, regional stability” and on “the devastating effects of [Russian President] Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on food security in Pakistan and worldwide”.
The Pakistan embassy also issued a press release of the same, and media in Pakistan also covered the meeting. Some circles speculated that Mr Fatemi was sent to arrange a meeting between US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif during the UN General Assembly in New York, being held in September this year.

 





 
But on July 22, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Islamabad disavowed the meeting. Asked at a news briefing to share the agenda of the talks, the spokesperson said: “Mr Fatemi is on a private visit to Washington and [the] Foreign Office did not play any role in his meeting with US officials”.
This caused considerable consternation to the American side, and Washington circles expressed concern.
In the US capital, Pakistan is increasingly being seen as a country where domestic political concerns often override relations with other nations, even if it is with a superpower like the US.
Diplomats — including at least two former Pakistani officials who have served in the US — point out that this has happened twice now: once during the so-called Cablegate controversy and, now with the visit of a senior Pakistani official to Washington.
“In the first case, a secret diplomatic cable was used to whip-up public support for a government that was facing a no-trust move,” said one of the two senior Pakistani diplomats.
“In the other case, the government sends a senior official to Washington, apparently to seek support for its efforts to revive the ailing economy but then disowns it, apparently because it fears annoying some quarters.”
“So, why deny it?” asked a diplomatic source, while commenting on this strange development. “There’s nothing earth-shattering in the official statements. Nothing that needed even an explanation, leave alone a denial.”
Hassan Abbas, who teaches international relations at Washington’s National Defence University, told Dawn that in his opinion, “A personal meeting with an official as senior as a deputy secretary is highly unlikely, particularly in the current situation. Such meetings do not happen without state support.”
He said that Pakistan changing its position like this “raises unnecessary questions about institutional cohesion in Pakistan at a time when Pakistan needs all kinds of support for its economic stability and regional policy vis-a-vis Afghanistan.”

6,Pakistani misses out on top prize in US scrabble championship,Waseem Khatri won 19 games in 28 rounds to reach the finals of the event.,"KARACHI: Waseem Khatri of Pakistan came tantalisingly close to winning the US National Scrabble Championship when he lost the finals by a narrow margin to Austin Shin of the United States in Baltimore, Maryland, on Wednesday.
In the end, it turned out to be a case of so near yet so far. Khatri lost the first game. In the second, he was leading by 90 points, but Shin played a last move bingo to clinch the game narrowly.
It was a heart-wrenching game as Khatri was leading from the start and managed to win the third round.
But he was immediately under pressure. It became a very tough ask when Khatri had to win the two remaining games to clinch the final.
The entire nation, Khatri’s mentors and proteges among them, prayed for his success as the fourth game started. But they were in for heartbreak as he lost that game too.
Speaking to Dawn, Tariq Pervez of the Pakistan Scrabble Association said he was still proud of Khatri. “It’s still a big achievement to reach the finals in such a hugely tough field.”
Waseem Khatri had won 19 games in 28 rounds to reach the finals of the event.
It was a historic moment for the Pakistan Scrabble Association (PSA) to see its very own scion making it to the finals. The association has been grooming young talent and seeing them bloom on their own since they receive no funding from the government.
The PSA holds inter-school championships where they pick the cream of young scrabble players, who are then given maximum practice, along with guidance, to polish their vocabulary, spelling, creativity, quick thinking, decision-making and knowledge to see to it that they are never at a loss for words.
Whiz kid
Khatri is a fine example of this. He started playing scrabble at home with an older cousin when he was around eight or nine years old. When his cousin realised that he was really good at scrabble, he introduced Khatri to the PSA when they were only a small group of scrabble players.
The group was started by Goshpi Avari after she saw a scrabble competition at the US consulate in Karachi in 1988. This group used to meet at the Beach Luxury Hotel every Friday to play scrabble.
As it grew in size, the group became the Scrabble Society and today, it is the Pakistan Scrabble Association.
When Waseem Khatri joined the scrabble group, he had no one of his age or size to play with. So he played with older players, the youngest of whom was around 40 years of age.
Of course, he would often lose to the seniors, but it enabled him to improve his game so much that there came a time when everyone started losing to him. That’s when they all arranged for him to play internationally, too.
The PSA used to fund his travel and stay abroad.
He was 18 years old in 2008 when he first travelled to India, accompanied by a couple of senior players. Although he couldn’t win there, he did manage to finish above his two senior teammates.
The following year, he was in Malaysia to participate in the World Scrabble Championship (WSC). This time he finished in the top half and qualified for the next edition. Today, at age 32, he has featured in many scrabble events and made his country proud all over the world.
He is also a big part of PSA’s youth programme. The association has given him a coaching assignment to groom younger players as well.
In fact, he is known as the ‘coach of coaches’ now. And all his disciples sent him their best wishes as he represented Pakistan once again on the international stage. His entry into the finals in the five-day championship kept them all awake till after midnight in Pakistan until the results came.

The spot where the accident took place is notorious for such accidents and several locals have also been killed in similar traffic accidents here in the past.
“At Bunbong Pardi point, the road is extremely narrow and the turning is very dangerous and any mistake at this point means fall of the vehicle into the deep Indus River and certain deaths,” Gulzar Hussain, a local resident, told Dawn.
Mr Hussain said that local people had been demanding the area leaders and the government for a long time to widen the road at this dangerous point or construct an alternative of the section of the road to avoid recurring deaths at the place, but the authorities had paid no heed to their pleadings.
