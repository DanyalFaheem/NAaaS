2,Imran hopeful about early elections in country,"Threatens ‘final’ march on Islamabad, flays ‘imported’ govt over inflation.","HARIPUR: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan on Wednesday warned that if the federal government failed to announce early elections in a free and fair manner, he would give the ‘final call’ for street protests to oust it.
He, however, said he hoped that the election announcement would be made before he unveiled plans for the final march on Islamabad.
“The nation is ready, so I am giving time to the imported government to announce general elections. My call [for its ouster] will be the final this time around. When the nation and PTI’s Tigers will march on Islamabad from all corners of the country, neither [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif, whose government is limited to Islamabad, nor [his coalition partners] Asif Zardari and Fazlur Rehman will be able to resist it,” Mr Imran told a public meeting at the Curtis Ground here.
The PTI chief insisted that his party wanted to see the country stable both economically and politically and that was possible only if free and fair polls were held.

Threatens ‘final’ march on Islamabad, flays ‘imported’ govt over inflation 

Mr Imran said neither the nation nor international community trusted the federal government.
He slammed the Shehbaz administration over high inflation and said the politicians and media opposed to his government were silent on the rising prices of essential goods, dwindling exports and shrinking foreign remittances. He said the growers were struggling to pay tubewell power bills leaving agricultural outputs vulnerable.
“Price hike was a mere pretext to oust me,” he said.
The PTI chief said despite the use of government machinery and rigging, the ruling coalition suffered defeat in the recent by-elections as the nation had awakened and was not ready to tolerate any hurdle to ‘real freedom’.
He said the PDM government had decided to get him disqualified for public offices by registering a terror case but such move won’t stop his movement for the nation’s ‘real freedom’.
Mr Imran said as the prime minister, he went to Moscow to buy fuel at ‘affordable’ rates but his government was sent packing to install an imported government comprising ‘notorious dacoits’.
Without naming names, he said they were afraid of him and dislodged his government through a conspiracy.
About the registration of a case of terrorism against him, the PTI chief said when a foreign university’s faculty member (his aide Shahbaz Gill) was ‘kidnapped for uttering a single sentence’ against the Pakistan Army on a TV show, he was stripped, tortured and sexually abused.
He wondered under which law a political worker was tortured for two days as revealed by his medical examination.
“Subjecting an assistant professor [Gill] to degrading and inhuman attitude and torture during detention and charging him with terrorism for raising questions brought the country a bad name globally. Had he uttered anything against the army, he should have been dealt with under the law.
Mr Imran appreciated his social media team for good performance but asked it for ‘constructive’ criticism of the acts of state institutions.
“Remember institutions are our own, so we should not cause them any harm. Any criticism directed towards them should be constructive,” he said.
The PTI chief said he or his party leaders had never insulted institutions the way leaders of ruling coalition Nawaz Sharif, Asif Zardari, Fazlur Rehman and Khawaja Asif did in the past.
“Our criticism has always been constructive but the ‘people’ dealt with us all alike,” he said.
The prime minister asked Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and PTI provincial president Pervez Khattak to re-organise the party in the province to prepare for elections in the country.
Noted among participants were CM Mahmood Khan, former federal ministers Asad Umar, Azam Swati, Omar Ayub and Pervez Khattak, acting provincial Governor Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani and members of the provincial assembly.

The procession was led by Peshawar District Bar Association president Ali Zaman and ILF provincial leaders, including Muzamil Khan, Saadullah Khan Marwat, Bilal Khalil, Fazal Maula and others. 
On this occasion, the protesters were addressed by different leaders who said that registration of a terrorism case against Mr Khan was unconstitutional. 
They said the ‘imported government’ had got panicked with the growing popularity of Mr Khan and they thought that they would pressurise him with the registration of a fake case. They said Mr Khan could not be cowed down with such tactics. 
Meanwhile, the protesters claimed that some lawyers affiliated with Pakistan Democratic Movement had been appointed as law officers in the KP Advocate General’s office. They demanded of the government to remove those law officers otherwise they would stage a demonstration near the CM House.

5,Peshawar High Court moved against notification for cases against PDM leaders,Lawyer insists govt misinterpreted law to serve political ends.,"PESHAWAR: A senior lawyer on Wednesday moved the Peshawar High Court against the provincial government’s recent notification for the empowerment of a government official in Dera Ismail Khan district to register cases against the leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) on the charge of spreading hate against state institutions.
Shabbir Hussain Gigyani filed the petition requesting the court to declare null and void the Aug 9 notification insisting the government misinterpreted Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure for empowering an additional assistant commissioner (AAC) to receive complaints from former federal minister Ali Ameen Gandapur or any other interested party and lodge FIRs with police.
He also sought the suspension of the notification until the final disposal of the petition as an interim relief saying as there is strong apprehension of its misuse and abuse by the respondents, including the government, to cause ‘chaos in the peaceful political and social atmosphere’ of the province.
The petitioner insisted that the notification was meant to misuse the law to achieve political goals and create anarchy in the province.

Lawyer insists govt misinterpreted law to serve political ends

A day ago, spokesman for the provincial government Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said the government had decided to take action against the PDM leaders for making hateful statements against state institutions in the recent past.
The provincial cabinet had allowed the registration of cases on Aug 18 and issued the impugned notification the next day.
The notification read, “In exercise of powers conferred by Section 196 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and in pursuance of cabinet decision on August 18, 2022, KP government is pleased to empower Mr Muneer Ahmed, Additional Assistant Commissioner, Dera Ismail Khan, to receive written complaints from Mr Gandapur or any other interested party and require local police to lodge FIRs under sections 108A, 153-A and 505 of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with any other enabling provisions of law, and to sanction and pursue such cases within his respective jurisdiction with effect from August 18, 2022.”
Section 153-A of the law deals with cases against those promoting enmity among different groups, while Section 108-A is aboutabetment in Pakistan of offences committed overseas.Section 505 covers statements on public mischief.
The respondents in the petition are the chief minister, chief and law secretaries, Mr Gandapur and the administration department’s cabinet section through its secretary and deputy secretary.
The petitioner contended that the respondents had wrongly interpreted Section 196 of the CrPC and issued the impugned notification for the registration of FIR, initiation of criminal proceedings, and opening of criminal cases against anyone.
He contended that Section 196 of the CrPC was meant for empowering the courts to take cognizance for trial of any such offence mentioned in the said section after completion of investigation and was not applicable before registration of FIR or case.
Mr Gigyani said Section 196 of the CrPC was meant for trial by courts and not for the lodging of FIR, initiation of criminal cases or institution of criminal complaints.
He said the section in question did not empower any ‘officer’ what to say about a private person (Mr Gandapur) to direct registration of FIR or initiation of a criminal case.

7,Health dept suspends free treatment contract of private hospital,The health facility had refused to treat heart patients on Sehat Card,"PESHAWAR: The health department has suspended the contract of a private hospital for refusing treatment to heart patients on Sehat Card Plus (SCP).
The action was taken in the light of the directives issued by Chief Minister Mahmood Khan that contract of empanelled hospitals refusing treatment to heart patients on SCP should be suspended.
Some patients had complained that some of the private hospitals were not willing to facilitate people requiring cardiac surgeries and procedures under the free treatment scheme.
Receiving the complaints, the chief minister ordered the authorities concerned to strictly monitor the situation and after carrying out though investigations, the hospitals found violating the contract should be removed from the list of the designated health facilities providing services on SCP, according to a press release.

The health facility had refused to treat heart patients on Sehat Card

However, officials told Dawn that some cardiologists in private and public sector hospitals wanted to enhance their package as the cost of stents and other supplies used in the process had gone up in view of devaluation of local currency. They said that the administration of the empanelled hospitals hadn’t halted surgical procedures but some surgeons stopped work to revise their packages.
Officials said that Rs4 billion under the programme was spent on the free treatment of cardiac patients so far, which was the highest amount, followed by people suffering from other diseases including gynea, cancers and kidney and liver transplants.
None of the empanelled hospitals has officially announced stoppage of services to the heart patients and the surgeons, who have refused to work on current package, have been removed by the hospital concerned.
Officials said that one meeting had taken place with the hospitals to review their packages with a legal permutable solution as fluctuation in dollar’s value became common.
Sources said that private hospitals wanted more raise in their packages but the chief minister issued the directives under which one of the health facilities was removed from the list of empanelled hospitals. The administration of the suspended hospital was first warned and later its contract was suspended, they added.
The private hospitals also provide treatment for several other ailments and earn 68 per cent of the amount from the programme per year. Most hospitals don’t want to lose the money they generate through treatment of other diseases on SCP. They have requested the government to increase their rates for cardiac procedure under the progarmme.
Officials said that the health facilities continued to facilitate patients and they were in talks with the hospitals to resolve the issue of higher cost of imported items.
The chief minister said in the statement that the free treatment scheme was a pro-poor initiative of the government and its 100 per cent benefits must reach to people at any cost. He directed the quarters concerned to look into the issue of private hospitals and take steps to ensure smooth treatment of people of the province.
He said that the flagship initiative should be enforced and there would be no compromise on provision of free treatment facilities to people in the registered private hospitals.
The chief minister said that all the empanelled hospitals should ensure free treatment under SCP or face strict action, according to officials.
They said that the hospitals were being monitored but so far only one hospital was removed from the list. They said that all the empanelled hospitals assured the health department about continuation of free health services to patients.

“International human rights organisation, the Jewish lobby, world media, and the UN are fully backing Imran Niazi, since he condemned attack on Salman Rushdie,” said Maulana Rehman, in a video message released here on Wednesday.
The former prime minister had told a newspaper that the attack on Salman Rushdie was unjustifiable and the anger of Muslims against the author was understandable, but it still did not justify the attack. Later Imran issued clarification, stating that his remarks on Rushdie were out of context.
The JUI-F chief said that the Jewish lobby was trying to pressurise the government of Pakistan. He said that the UN and world media had started issuing statements in support of Imran Khan. The Jewish lobby, he said, was now terming the “rebellious activities” of the former prime minister as a struggle for democracy, in order to protect him.
He said that the Jewish lobby was pro-active in bringing Imran Khan to power through rigging. He said that JUI-F would play its role for the supremacy of the Constitution if the state institutions did not take action against Imran Khan owing to pressure from Zionist lobbies.
The JUI-F chief said that the UN and other bodies did not take notice of the human rights violations in Pakistan when the previous government of Pakistan-i-Threek Insaf put a former prime minister, ministers and other political leaders in jail, through fake corruption cases.
He said that the state institutions were using delaying tactics, despite corruption charges and foreign funding cases against Imran and his party. 
He said that Imran and his family considered themselves above the Constitution and law of the land.
