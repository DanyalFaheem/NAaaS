0,PM Shehbaz constitutes search committee to appoint PMC members,Health minister to head body; PMC employees urge prime minister not to sack them.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has constituted a search committee comprising seven members which will undertake the task of appointing members to the Medical and Dental Council and the National Medical and Dental Academic Board of the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC).
The committee will invite applications from candidates fulfilling the prerequisites through advertisements and then follow the necessary process for appointing them as members.
The search committee is to be presided over by Minister of National Health Services Abdul Qadir Patel while the secretary establishment will serve as the vice chairman. 
Other members are federal health secretary, Dr Mohammad Aurangzeb, Dr Syed Ali Farhan Razi and MNAs Zahra Wadood Fatemi and Prof Dr Aamir Aziz.

Health minister to head body; PMC employees urge prime minister not to sack them

It is worth mentioning here that on Aug 20, the PMC came to a standstill after PM Sharif withdrew nomination of seven of its nine members.
The PMC was established after dissolving the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) through the Pakistan Medical Commission Ordinance 2019 and later replaced by the Pakistan Medical Commission Act 2020.
According to a Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) issued by the government, “In exercise of powers conferred by the PMC Act 2020, the nominating authority i.e. Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has withdrawn the nomination of all members of the Medical and Dental Council notified on 25th September 2020.”
As per the PMC Act, out of the nine members, the prime minister was authorised to nominate seven, including three from civil society, three licensed medical practitioners and one licensed dentist.
The surgeon general of the armed forces and the secretary of the health ministry are ex-officio members of the commission.
“The prime minister was getting complaints from students all over the country, especially from Balochistan, as there was no representation of provinces in the PMC and it was creating a sense of deprivation among provinces,” said government sources.
Another set of sackings on cards
While the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) Bill 2022 is on the verge of being approved, it will be the second time in the last three years when hundreds of employees may lose their jobs. Employees of the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) have, therefore, urged the government not to let this happen.
Earlier, over 200 regular employees of the defunct PMDC with pensionable jobs were left on the road when the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government dissolved the PMDC and established the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC).
The decision of the PTI government, in 2019, not only made people jobless but tens of pensioners and their families suffered as they stopped receiving their pensions. 
The employees had filed a petition before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the court had restored all employees on their original terms, declaring all appointments done by the PMC illegal.
However, the employees could not be restored.
The National Assembly already passed a bill which suggests abolishing the PMC and restoring PMDC.
A former employee of the defunct PMDC, requesting not to be named, said in the PMDC the same work was done by employees in a department with one fourth of the salary that the current employees were getting. “Even if this bill was not in field, all the PMC employees are appointed on contracts and the contract can be terminated anytime with one month’s notice,” he said.
“More than 220 PMDC employees were thrown out of their jobs by the PMC. More than 30 regular employees were sent home with only seven to eight months of salary. More than 25 contractual employees who served for over five years in the PMDC were sacked by the PMC without any intimation and without any salary or benefit,” he said.
“The PMC stopped pensions of more than 30 pensioners who were old and not able to work anywhere but the commission showed no mercy to them. On the other hand, the PMC appointed employees on the highest salaries starting from Rs300,000 to Rs1.1 million despite most of them not fulfilling the basic criteria and experience,” the former PMDC official claimed.
On the other hand, PMC employees have asked the government not to remove them from their jobs.
There are more than 120 employees of PMC who fear that they might lose their jobs, the letter read, adding that these employees want to serve the government. They have urged the prime minister and health minister to take their concerns into consideration.
The employees appealed to the government that they must not be removed from their ongoing jobs and should be adjusted in the upcoming format of medical and dental council, it stated, adding that the families of all PMC employees were dependent on their bread earner.
They have expressed concern that under such circumstances and the current economic situation it is impossible to even survive without a job. 
It is once again requested to the high ups to kindly take notice of this on priority, the statement added.

3,Another bogus plot allotment scam surfaces in CDA,Fact-finding inquiry being conducted by CDA’s security directorate.,"ISLAMABAD: An alleged bogus plots allotment case involving the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has surfaced again as three files of sector E-13 in this regard have been caught before their transfers.
The new scam surfaced last week and now a fact-finding inquiry is being conducted by CDA’s security directorate.  Sources said that last week, an attempt was made for transfer of three plots in sector E-13. 
However, on direction of member estate, the transfer was stopped and an inquiry was launched.
The sources said on the basis of No Demand Certificates (NDCs) issued by land directorate, someone submitted case of three files at One Window Operation (OWO) for transfer of plots. Subsequently, the officials of OWO issued Transfer Application Forms (TF) for transfers of plots. 
Meanwhile, someone intimated member estate therefore, the allotment process was stopped.
Meanwhile, member directed security directorate to start probe. 
Sources said that record of all three said files have been missing, which implying that the said three plots were allotted fraudulently and now  through fraud, same were being further transferred, but the attempt was foiled.  
Interestingly, the officials of land directorate disowned the NDCs saying that they did not sign the NDC and same carries “fake” signatures.
“There are several question marks on this issue, as if files of plots are bogus, why the plots were allotted previously, if files were not available why TF was issued,” said an official of CDA, adding that it seems a racket is working CDA’s land and One Window Operation directorates.  
The sources said disowning the signatures is an old practice in CDA and this is time for the authority to get the forensic of signatures done to reach the truth.  
An officer of land directorate speaking to Dawn on Wednesday on condition of anonymity said that land directorate itself intimated member office and OWO about the fake NDCs of three plots of E-13.
Earlier, last month CDA management formed a committee headed by deputy director general estate to probe alleged fraudulent allotment of seven plots in sector D-13 within 10 days. 
This scam surfaced earlier this year, when the then additional director land Sobia Toru, pointed out her fake signature on some files. Sources said that probe of the D-13 scam is near completion.
A couple of years ago, over 100 such allotments in sector I-11 and I-12 based on backdated signatures surfaced and the security directorate had pointed out that a detailed investigation must be carried out. 
However, so far, neither 100 plots were declared cancelled, nor action was taken against anyone. 
In fact, a detailed inquiry has still not been completed.
Earlier, in 2017 the CDA introduced a new policy stating that in future, no plot would be allotted to those affected by land acquisition on pick and choose basis and all such allotments would be made through balloting. 
For this, the CDA had prepared lists of 800 plots available in the sectors and had allotted around 250 through balloting while the remaining were kept in record for the future.
Later on, no balloting was carried out which signifies that the plots that were kept in CDA’s record in 2017 should be available as vacant. 
However, a large number of plots that were shown as vacant, particularly in sector I-12 in 2017 were marked as allotted in later years.
Some officials alleged that since these allotments were made fraudulently, questions about authenticity of some of the files were raised. 
A few years ago, the security directorate had confiscated record of seven fraudulent files of I series sector from One Window Operation (OWP), minutes before their transfer. 
The case was referred to Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) as well, which last year, registered a first information report (FIR) related to one plot while a probe is still going on into the remaining files.

The dry port in the lakeside city, which is not only home to hundreds of thousands of UK based expatriates but also an industrial hub of the liberated territory, had been the demand of local and non-local importers, industrialists and traders for the past three decades and on a number of occasions in the past the federal government had shown willingness for its establishment.
However, efforts in this regard picked up momentum after Mr Ilyas took over as AJK premier some four months ago mainly because of 
his experience and expertise in business, investment and trade related affairs.
Mr Ilyas, a real estate tycoon whose family runs vast businesses in Pakistan as well as Saudi Arabia, had also served as adviser to the chief minister Punjabon affairs related to business, investment and trade before formally venturing into the AJK politics early last year.
According to Mirza Wajahat Rasheed Baig, AJK secretary for commerce, industry and minerals, the dry port complex is being built on a more than 110-kanals plot at an estimated cost of Rs815.8 million.
He said the prime minister had strictly directed all the departments concerned to accomplish the complex before the stipulated period of 18 months.
In his speech on the occasion, the prime minister said thathe felt relieved that this vitally important project which had been pending for the past 32 years had finally seen the light of day in his rule.
“It [establishment of the dry port] was your dream, it was our dream and it’s being translated into reality at our hands because we have a deep rooted commitment with our people,” he said to the audience amid applause.
The AJK PM asserted that the landmark project would openupnew vistasof socio-economicdevelopment and employmentopportunities for the Kashmiri people as well as those residing in the adjoining areas of Pakistan.
He said that an industrial zone would also be established in Mirpur which would be connected with the industrial areas of Punjab through a network of state of the art arteries.
“It will not only ease inter and intra country trade but also augment revenue generation in our state,” he said.
Announcing that an international airport would also be built in Mirpur, the AJK premier disclosed on 
the occasion that a US based businessman of Kashmiri origin had also obtained the license for the liberated territory’s first international private airline.
“Since I have been an ardent advocate from the day one of tapping our rich potential for the benefit of its people, I was offered by the national institutions soon after the installation of our government that if we were willing to launch our own airliner, they will fully facilitate us in all respects,” he said.
