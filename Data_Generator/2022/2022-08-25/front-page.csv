• Analysts say pledged capital sketchy for now; $2bn may be in form of safe deposits, quantum of investment likely to be over $1bn
KARACHI: The state-owned investment fund of Qatar is going to invest $3 billion in Pakistan, an official statement from the off­ice of the energy-rich country’s ruler said on Wednesday.
The Emiri Diwan, the administrative office of the emir, released the statement as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held official talks with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani in Doha following a meeting with the sovereign fund officials a day ago.
The $450bn Qatar Investment Authority announced its “aspiration to invest $3bn in various commercial and investment sectors in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan”, it said.
The investment from the Gulf nation is expected to help Pakistan bridge the widening gap between the inflows and outflows of dollars that’s resulting in a persistent balance-of-payments crisis. The dollar shortage has weakened the local currency and caused a drawdown on the central bank-held foreign exchange reserves, which dropped to $7.9bn at the last count.
Speaking to Dawn, Arif Habib Ltd Head of Research Tahir Abbas said the information about the nature of the pledged investment is sketchy at the moment. “I think $2bn will be in the form of safe deposits with the central bank while $1bn will constitute the investment part,” he said.
Earlier this week, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Acting Governor Murtaza Syed told analysts in a post-monetary policy briefing that the country would receive $2bn from Qatar in the next 12 months. Although the Qatari statement didn’t mention if the pledged investment was in addition to $2bn indicated by the SBP’s acting chief, analysts believe the two amounts will likely overlap.
International news agency Bloomberg reported Qatar is evaluating strategic investments in Islamabad and Karachi airports in addition to stakes in renewable energy, power and hospitality sectors.
Wire service Reuters said Doha has shown interest in airport management partnership and the Roosevelt Hotel in New York’s Manha­ttan, which is owned by Pakistan International Air­lines (PIA). It quoted officials as saying that Pakistan has offered a 25pc stake in the hotel, which shut down in 2020 because of a coronavirus-related slump in international travel.
However, Mr Abbas said any substantial progress in the matter of investments in PIA and its hotel is unlikely given the mounting political challenges the government faces on the domestic front.
“We were expecting some update on LNG, but there’s been no word on that so far. We get eight cargoes from Qatar every month. We’re looking for two to three additional cargoes on the long-term basis,” he said.
Qatar is a major supplier of LNG to Pakistan on a long-term contract basis. It’s also sponsoring one of the two upcoming LNG terminals in Karachi.
Topline Securities Associate Director of Research Umair Naseer told Dawn it’ll be futile to expect Qatar to provide Pakistan with additional LNG cargoes on a long-term basis.
“Supplies are already constrained. Europe is desperate for energy as the winter is approaching. Even if Qatar offered to sell us LNG on a long-term basis, it’d make little sense for Pakistan to sign up for long-term supplies given the prevailing high prices,” he said.
Meanwhile, a statement from the prime minister’s office on Wednesday said Mr Sharif and Qatar’s emir agreed to increase the bilateral trade, deepen collaboration in agriculture and food sectors and boost cooperation in energy, renewable energy, tourism and hospitality segments. They also agreed to expand cooperation in defence, aviation and maritime sectors.
Recalling Pakistan’s long-term partnership with Qatar in the LNG sector, the prime minister thanked the emir for his support in meeting Pakistan’s energy needs. The two sides also explored new avenues for mutually beneficial cooperation in the energy sector.
Sheikh Tamim reassured Mr Sharif of Qatar’s commitment to forging a stronger economic partnership with Pakistan. The premier thanked the emir for Qatar Investment Authority’s readiness to invest $3bn in various commercial and investment sectors in Pakistan.
Mr Sharif’s visit to Qatar comes ahead of an International Monetary Fund meeting next week that is expected to approve more than $1bn in financing that has been stalled since the beginning of the year. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have also indicated to provide $1bn each in oil purchase financing.
The prime minister on Tuesday invited the Qatar Investment Authority to invest in Pakistan’s energy and aviation sectors. He previously mentioned renewable energy, food security, industrial and infrastructure development, tourism and hospitality among sectors of interest.

1,SC moved for withdrawal of fuel price adjustment from power bills,"LHC allows dozens of petitioners to pay only bill amount for July, excluding FPA.","ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: In the wake of daily protests by the general public and traders against inflated electricity bills, a local lawyer on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the federal government to either withdraw completely or at least reduce to some extent the Fuel Price Adjustment (FPA) charges and other surcharges from the utility bills.
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court allowed dozens of petitioners to pay only the electricity bill for July, excluding the FPA amount.
Advocate Zulfikar Ahmed Bhutto, while acting pro bono publico, filed a petition with the apex court to invite its attention to the huge bills that the power companies had dispatched to consumers during July-August.
Over the last few days, the petition highlighted, electricity consumers across different cities of the country had taken to the streets against the FPA and other taxes in the bills, as the payables had jacked up to an unbearable level for them.

LHC allows dozens of petitioners to pay only bill amount for July, excluding FPA

Citing media reports, the petitio­ner also highlighted that the consu­mers were torching their electricity bills during protest demonstrations being staged regularly in different cities and pledging not to pay them until immediate withdrawal of the FPA and other taxes, and issuance of fresh electricity bills by the power distribution companies.
The petition regretted that the government, instead of introducing people-friendly policies, was imposing heavy taxes on the poor electricity consumers, thus bringing extreme discomfort to the lives of even the middle class. At a time when making both ends meet had already become difficult for families owing to the rising prices of essential commodities, the massive FPA and other taxes in power bills had broken the backs of people, the petition stressed, highlighting that a majority of people were earning Rs15,000 to Rs20,000 a month and trying to survive in rented houses in poor localities.
It regretted that the authorities gave an impression to the people that the power bills had been inflated to such an extent under pressure from the International Monetary Fund. But, astonishingly, on the contrary, the government was enhancing service benefits of officials already receiving hefty salaries going into millions, free fuel, house rents and medical facilities etc.
Recently, the Punjab government increased the financial benefits for the lower judiciary, the petition mentioned, adding that on the other hand, taxes were being imposed on the poor. The petition also highlighted Article 25 of the Constitution, which ensures equality for citizens, but regretted that this constitutional guarantee was not being ensured. Likewise, Article 25A says education was a right of every child in the country, but due to rising prices, this right was being denied to children.
Similarly, it stated, Article 37 provides for promotion of social justice and eradication of social evils, but because of such “unjustified heavy financial burden” on the poor through the electricity bills, the purpose of this provision was discouraged. The plea also argued about its maintainability under Article 184(3) since difficulties were being faced by the people throughout the country and they were being deprived of their fundamental rights, as promised in the Constitution.
Bill payment excluding FPA
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court allowed dozens of petitioners to pay only the electricity bills for July, excluding the FPA amount.
Justice Shahid Waheed passed the order on the petitions filed by Muhammad Sadiq and others, challenging the recovery of the FPA in electricity bills for July.
The counsel for the petitioners argued that the process, assessment, observations, purported calculations and the claim of the FPA in the bills was not based on legally verifiable technical and financial data with respect to power production and cost calculation.
He contended that the misconceived statutory interpretation of tariff determination framework by the National Electricity and Power Regulatory Authority while calculating and charging the FPA on the basis of unverified data resulted in defective exercise of the regulator.
The counsel stated that the respondent charged the FPA by violating its legal and regulatory mandate in breach of the Constitution, as the same was in violation of articles 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10-A, 14, 18 and 25 of the Constitution being devoid of the principle of procedural fairness and due process.
He asked the court to order the federal government to undertake all necessary steps to bring forward a uniformed regulatory framework, appropriate administrative and institutional arrangement in relation to FPA calculations, tariff determination and electricity billing.
As an interim and immediate relief, the counsel urged the court to suspend the recovery of the FPA through electricity bills.
The judge issued notices to the respondents for Sept 14 and allowed the petitioners to pay the amount of their electricity bills within the due date except the FPA for July. The judge directed the registrar office to club all similar petitions on the next hearing.

2,ECP puts off LG polls in seven districts of Karachi,"ISLAMABAD: A day after postponing local government elections in nine districts of Hyderabad division, the Election...","ISLAMABAD: A day after postponing local government elections in nine districts of Hyderabad division, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday postponed local government (LG) polls in seven districts of Karachi division, thus putting on hold the entire second phase of the electoral exercise for grassroots tier of democracy scheduled for Aug 28.
The decision was taken at an ECP meeting which was convened to review weather conditions, non-availability of security personnel for electoral exercise because of their deployment in flood-hit areas to provide relief to the masses and issues rela­ted to logistics. The meeting was presided over by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja.
The new date for the LG polls will now be announced once the weather conditions improved, the ECP announced in a statement issued after the meeting.
The ECP statement said that reports of the chief secretary, Sindh IG, provincial election commissioner, wea­ther conditions, non-availability of members of law-enforcement agencies for electoral exercise, provision of logistics, public interest and convenience of voters had been kept in mind by the ECP while taking the decision to put off the proposed polls in Karachi division.
The secretary of election commission briefed the meeting about the conduct of the second phase of local government elections in Sindh.
Referring to the report of the Meteorological Depart­ment, the secretary of election commission of Pakistan Umar Hameed Khan said that heavy rains had been predicted in Karachi from Aug 24 to Aug 26, 2022, and there were chances of rains also on Aug 27 and Aug 28, the polling day.
He said the chief secretary and IG of Sindh had informed the ECP in writing that all the administration, police personnel and members of law-enforcement agencies were now engaged in flood relief operations in affected areas of Sindh.
The meeting was further informed that there was also a need to maintain law and order during relief operations in flood-hit areas and because of this situation, the movement of police was not possible.
In his report, the IG of Sindh said that in the current flood situation, additional police force from interior of Sindh could no longer be deployed in Karachi for LG elections, which was very important for the conduct of peaceful elections in the megacity.
He said that other law-enforcement agencies, including Rangers, were supposed to perform duties in the most-sensitive polling stations along with police, and the Pakistan Army was supposed to provide the third tier of support, but they were now engaged in flood relief operations and, therefore, it would not be possible for the Rangers and the Pakistan Army to join hands with police during the LG polls.
The provincial election commissioner told the meeting that there would be other logistic issues besides transporting polling material and polling staff, especially the women polling staff.
He said there would also be serious problems in transporting 63,000 polling staff to 4900 polling stations for Karachi elections, and requested that Karachi division LG polls be postponed for now.
The polling in the megacity was to be held on August 28 (Sunday) in districts East, West, South, Central, Korangi, Keamari and Malir of Karachi division and Hyderabad, Dadu, Jamshoro, Matiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Badin, Sujawal and Thatta districts of Hyderabad division — in the second phase of the LG polls.
The second phase of the local government elections was originally scheduled to be held on July 24, but on July 20 the polls had been put off till Aug 28 because of the possibility of rains and bad weather.

3,Plea to extend Gill’s remand for seven days rejected,ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad district and sessions court rejected a request by the capital police on Wednesday for a...,"ISLAMABAD: An Islamabad district and sessions court rejected a request by the capital police on Wednesday for a seven-day extension in the physical remand of PTI leader Shahbaz Gill, who was arrested earlier this month on charges of sedition and inciting mutiny through his controversial remarks on a TV channel.
The judgement comes as the two-day period of Mr Gill’s remand — initially approved last Wednesday — expired, much later than the scheduled date as the court noted at previous hearings that the remand began late and thus remained incomplete.
The judgement was issued by Judicial Magistrate Malik Aman, who sent Mr Gill on judicial remand.
The court said in its order the law required that every investigation be completed without unnecessary delay and the police were bound to submit an investigation report in the court.
If the investigation was still incomplete 14 days after the FIR was lodged, the officer in charge of the police station was required to forward an interim report to the magistrate through a prosecutor within three days, the order said.
Mr Gill, arrested on Aug 9, was initially sent to judicial remand for two days. The court noted that neither an interim nor a complete report had been presented by the prosecution despite the lapse of 15 days.
“Physical remand cannot be granted repeatedly, for the same purpose, without any positive progress,” it ruled, sending the PTI leader to the judicial lock-up.
The magistrate instructed the police to produce him before the court on Sept 7. The verdict enabled Mr Gill to apply for post-arrest bail.
During the hearing, special prosecutor Rizwan Abbasi argued that the police needed Mr Gill’s custody for seven more days for a polygraph test to ascertain whether he was telling the truth.
Mr Gill was using multiple phones, the prosecutor said, adding the police had traced and recovered some of them, but his “most important cell phone was still missing”.
The defence counsel told the court the police were seeking Mr Gill’s custody “to torture him”.
Meanwhile, when Mr Gill was being escorted by the police outside of the court, he was asked by a reporter on the nature of his alleged sexual assault, to which Mr Gill claimed it was “absolutely right”, elaborating that he was given “electric shocks to the genital area”.
Mr Gill alleged that he was subjected to torture so that he would give statements against “someone”. While leaving the court, he also raised slogans urging people to raise their voice for Jameel Farooqui, an anchor and vlogger who claimed to have been stripped and beaten while in police custody.
HRW seeks probe
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) has demanded an “immediate, independent, and transparent” investigation into Mr Gill’s torture allegations, and urged Pakistan to legislate and make torture a criminal offence.
“Pakistan’s sedition law, based on a colonial-era British provision, is vague and overbroad and has often been used against political opponents,” the New York-based rights group said in a statement on Wednesday.
“By passing the torture bill, Pakistan will start a long-overdue process of reform to ensure that future allegations of torture are transparently investigated and that those responsible held accountable,” said John Sifton, HRW’s Asia advocacy director.
Rashid, Murad get interim bail
Former interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and PTI leaders, including Murad Saeed, were granted interim bail in a case registered against them for staging a rally in violation of Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
ADSJ Faizan Haider Gillani accepted their pre-arrest bail plea against Rs20,000 surety bonds until Sept 9, when the next hearing is scheduled.
The court also issued notice to the state and sought a reply on Mr Ahmed’s application.

LAHORE / LOWER DIR / SWAT: Heavy rains and floods claimed eight lives, including six schoolchildren, in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Wednesday as various parts of the country continued to receive heavy rainfall.
At least six children were killed when they were swept away by floods, while nine other people were injured in rain related incidents as continuous torrential rains caused flooding in the Upper Dir and Swat districts, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa confirmed.
Similarly, Rescue 1122 Punjab confirmed two deaths from hill torrents; one in Dera Ghazi Khan and one in Rajanpur. The torrents have also taken their toll on the infrastructure of schools, healthcare facilities, roads, electricity lines and irrigation canals.

Thousands of flood-displaced people are stranded on the banks of the river and along the Indus Highway, without any shelter in the rain. Meanwhile, waist-deep water is still standing in and around the localities where they dwell.
The deaths in Punjab brought the death toll in the province to 38 during the last two weeks.
Flooding in Swat, Lower Dir
In Upper Dir, five schoolchildren drowned in a flooded stream at Kasai Shahikot in the jurisdiction of Barawal police station.
Rescuers said that the children were on their way back from school when they were washed away by rushing waters. The victims included the son and a daughter of one Syed Aman, a son and a daughter of Zakir and an unidentified child. Rescuers said that dead bodies of four of the children were found later when the water receded, while the search for the fifth child was still ongoing.
Earlier, the niece of one Haji Rahim Gul drowned in a stream at Zangian village of Samarbagh. After hectic efforts, locals managed to retrieve the body from the stream.
Similarly, a two-room house colla­p­sed due to torrential rains in the Gan­digar area of Upper Dir. The occupants, however, remained unhurt.
In addition, hundreds of school students who were trapped by flash floods in Mingora had to be rescued by locals, Rescue 1122, and civil defense teams.
Malakand Division Commissioner Shaukat Ali Yousafzai said that all the departments were actively taking part in relief activities. “Relief measures have been initiated after the water subsided and in this regard, all resources are being utilised in light of the orders of Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mahmood Khan,” he said, adding that he was supervising all the arrangements himself.
Infrastructure damage
A large swathe of DG Khan has been submerged by water, causing widespread power supply disruptions. The loss to power transmission infrastructure here is immense, and statistics show that 640 transformers, 1,575 single phase meters and 145 three phase meters were damaged in the area during the recent heavy rains.
Mepco Superintendent Engineer (Dera Ghazi Khan) Muhammad Hasnain Shakeel told Dawn that out of the 21 subdivisions of Mepco Circle, areas in Fort Munro, Rojhan and Tubi Qaisrani were completely submerged, while Wahowa and Choti areas were 75pc under water and around half of the Shadan Lound, Dajal, Rajanpur, Shah Sadr Deen and Quetta Road areas had been inundated.
An official told Dawn that the rail track from Taunsa barrage to Rojhan has also been damaged.
The irrigation department infrastructure also was badly hit by strong waters of hill torrents in both districts. Roads and dozens of link bridges had also been washed away. Barthi Road and Taunsa-Musakhel Road are still closed and the N55 Indus Highway is in bad shape after the floods and in need of immediate repair. In all, as many as 60 roads in both districts have been washed away.
Separately, Chief Executive Officer Education Zulfiqar Malghani told Dawn that 86 schools were hit by floodwaters and closed in Dera Ghazi Khan district, while an official from Rajanpur claimed that 60pc of the schools in the district had been submerged and the remaining converted into relief camps.
Editorial: Rain disaster
Chief Executive Officer Health Dr Abdul Karim told Dawn that 30 health facilities, including basic health units and rural health centres had been badly affected by downpours and hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan. In Rajanpur, he said, 60pc of health infrastructure had been hit by floods.
In addition, a large stock of wheat stored by the food department in Fazilpur and Shahdan Lound has been destroyed.
Relief activities
The Punjab government has started provision of relief goods including food and medicine in flood hit areas of districts Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur.
However, locals complained that while they saw vehicles carrying food and shelter, the bureaucracy was distributing the items in their preferred areas.
In Lahore, Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi presided over the Disaster Management Ministerial Committee meeting being held at the Chief Minister’s Office, where relief activities relating to the flood affected areas in Rajanpur, Taunsa and Dera Ghazi Khan came under review.

The CM directed Chief Secretary Kamran Afzal to visit the flood affected areas forthwith and further directed him to oversee the relief activities for the flood affectees.
He also ordered that rescue and relief operations be expedited and all institutions should help the flood hit population.
A Rescue 1122 officer told Dawn that relief activities were initiated on Wednesday, adding that they were providing boats to the district administration to transport bags of food and medicine.
He said he had seen any NGO providing help to flood victims in Rajanpur.
Meanwhile, DG Khan Deputy Commissioner Anwar Baryar on Wednesday ordered that roads be cleared of land sliding and bridges be repaired.
