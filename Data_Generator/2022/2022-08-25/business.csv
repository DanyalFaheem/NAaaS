0,Govt advised against steep regulatory duties ahead of IMF meet,FBR says measures to yield around Rs20bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Tariff Commission (NTC) has cautioned the federal government of a possible fallout of imposing the highest-ever regulatory duties (RD) on goods imports ahead of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) executive board meeting, Dawn has learned from sources.
The IMF board meeting is scheduled for Aug 29 to approve disbursement of $1.18bn under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
Fearing the reaction from the IMF board members as well as other multilateral institutions like the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the World Bank, the NTC’s top officials suggested the government avoid imposing regulatory duties ahead of the board meeting because many countries will be affected by this decision at a time when the global economy is slowing down.
Despite opposition from various quarters, including the NTC, to the decision, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail prevailed and implemented the decision to scale up regulatory duties from 20pc to 50pc and from 40pc to 100pc on nearly 800 items.

FBR says measures to yield around Rs20bn

Well-placed sources told Dawn the finance minister had convinced Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to approve his summary of imposing regulatory duties on nearly 800 items, including automobiles, mobile phones and other products.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) made the announcement in the SRO1571 dated 2022.
The IMF’s executive board meeting for the combined seventh and eighth reviews under the EFF is scheduled for Aug 29. Pakistan has already withdrawn the three-month ban on 800 items under the direction of the IMF, and both the WTO and the government admitted that the decision to ban items caused damage to the retail sector.
The WTO and the IMF policies were working in synchronisation, a former Pakistan ambassador to the WTO told Dawn on condition of anonymity. He said the Fund always took input from the WTO Secretariat regarding the trade-related policies of the member countries.
These “anti-trade measures”, he said, might have a cost and give negative signals to trade partners and multilateral trade institutions.
The WTO has already conveyed its concerns over Islamabad’s ad hoc policy measures, like regulatory duties, which hamper the free flow of trade and cause injuries to local industries.
The global economies are stepping towards a slowdown in the wake of the Ukraine crisis. It will be difficult for Pakistan to defend these regulatory duties.
The FBR believes that the measures will generate around Rs20 billion in revenue. However, these regulatory measures will further disrupt the supply chain and further accelerate import-led inflation in the country.
The previous government shifted the authority to change tariffs from the FBR to the Tariff Policy Board (TPB), chaired by the commerce minister. Any changes in tariffs are now the sole prerogative of the TPB, according to a senior official in the commerce ministry. This was the sole reform measure implemented in compliance with IMF recommendations under its loan programme.
Ahead of the Tariff Policy Board meeting, the finance ministry has already finalised a summary regarding changes in tariffs in consultation with the tariff policy wing of the customs department at FBR, a tax official said, adding that on the same summary, the TBP meeting was convened last Sunday at a short notice.
Commerce Minister Naveed Qamar, TPB’s chairperson at present, was taken on board virtually to give legal cover to the summary. The meeting was also attended by Mr Ismail, who is not a member of the TPB. “A finance minister cannot attend this meeting,” the source said, adding that Miftah Ismail actually suggested changes in determining the regulatory duties on specific sectors.
According to the source, Mr Qamar also opposed the regulatory duties. However, the finance minister prevailed and informed the committee that the prime minister wanted to impose regulatory duties, the source said.
The source said the only beneficiaries of this decision were local food manufacturers, which would further increase the prices of their products and earn a windfall profit.
Regulatory duties
The regulatory duty on new four-by-four vehicles, minivans, all-terrain vehicles and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) has been raised to 100pc. The new duties will remain in place until Feb 21 next year.
Moreover, an additional 7pc customs duty imposed on all those goods falls under the tariff slab of 30pc, higher slabs and specific rates. However, a 2pc duty will be levied on goods falling under specific PCT codes, as well as cars, jeeps, and light commercial vehicles in CKD condition with displacements greater than 1,000cc and heavy commercial vehicles in CKD condition.
A 35pc additional customs duty was imposed on SUVs. The regulatory duty on the import of new vehicles with a cylinder capacity of 1,000cc to 1,300cc has been increased from 5pc to 100pc.
For spring, air, or gas guns and pistols, truncheons, firearms and similar devices that operate by firing an explosive charge, the duty was raised to 45pc.
The duty on jams, fruit jellies, marmalades, fruit or nut puree, and fruit or nut pastes (obtained by cooking, whether or not containing added sugar or other sweetening matter), spectacles, goggles has been raised to 49pc.
Moreover, the regulatory duty on pianos, including the automatic ones, and other string musical instruments has been increased to 47pc.

1,CAD shrinks 45pc in July,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s current account deficit (CAD) shrank 45 per cent month-on-month to $1.2 billion in July, the...","KARACHI: Pakistan’s current account deficit (CAD) shrank 45 per cent month-on-month to $1.2 billion in July, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Wednesday.
The country’s trade deficit dropped 18.3pc to $2.64bn during the same month from $3.23bn a year ago. 
Pakistan posted a massive current account deficit of $17.3bn in the previous fiscal year, or a monthly average of $1.44bn.  
The sharp contraction in CAD could be a temporary relief for the government as it may ease pressure on the external front but will depress the economic growth as lower imports of raw materials will slow down industrial production which may result in higher unemployment in the current fiscal year.
The import declined mainly due to a ban on 800 luxury and non-essential goods by the PML-N-led coalition government on May 19, but the trade and industry did not welcome the move since it also hurt the economic activities.
The data released by the SBP showed that the imports of goods stood at  $5.39bn in July compared to $7.03bn in June. It also showed that the  exports declined by 26pc to $2.295bn in July against $3.134bn in June,  reflecting the poor performance on the external front of the economy.
In the last month of FY22, the imports edged up to $7.74bn from $6.28bn in the same month preceding year. The overall imports surged by 43.4pc to $80.5bn in 2021-22, up from $56.12bn a year ago; this was the main reason for the huge current account deficit.
It was believed that the declining imports would reduce pressure on the exchange rate but the dollar once again started going up against the local currency.
“The current account deficit shrank to $1.2bn in July from $2.2bn in June, largely reflecting a sharp decline in energy imports and a continued moderation in other imports,” the SBP tweeted.
“The narrower deficit is the result of wide-ranging measures taken in recent months to moderate growth and contain imports, including tight monetary policy, fiscal consolidation and some temporary administrative measures,” it said.
The CAD is the biggest problem for the government which made the exchange rate vulnerable and weakened the external front of the economy. Despite, all efforts so far, not a single dollar landed in SBP accounts from creditors like IMF to support the falling foreign exchange reserves.
Rupees falls to 218.38 against dollar
Meanwhile, the US dollar maintained its upward journey and appreciated by 72 paise against the rupee in the interbank market on Wednesday.
The State Bank of Pakistan reported closing price at Rs218.38 compared to Rs217.66 a day earlier.
Currency dealers have been keenly waiting for the inflows of $2bn from Qatar and a $1.18bn tranche from the IMF as its executive board meets on Aug 29 to approve the resumption of loans to Pakistan.

2,US firm buys Cloudways for $350m,The size of the transaction will make it one of the biggest foreign acquisitions in Pakistan’s history.,"KARACHI: New York Stock Exchange–listed firm DigitalOcean Holdings Inc is going to buy Cloudways — a Pakistani company that provides small and medium-sized businesses with cloud hosting and software as a service (SaaS) facilities — for $350 million in cash.
According to a company statement released on Wednesday, a significant portion of the consideration will be paid over a 30-month period following the closing of the transaction in September.
The size of the transaction will make it one of the biggest foreign acquisitions in Pakistan’s history. “The acquisition will simplify workflows for small to medium-sized businesses that are looking for easier ways to build and scale their digital businesses,” it said.
Cloudways is expected to generate “more than $52 million in revenue in fiscal 2022,” representing a three-year compound annual growth rate in excess of 50 per cent.
DigitalOcean and Cloudways have been close partners since 2014. Cloudways currently relies on DigitalOcean infrastructure to power approximately 50pc of its customers. Cloudways serves an international and growing customer base. Together, they’ll serve over 124,000 customers paying over $50 per month, representing approximately 84pc of the pro forma company’s total revenue.
Cloudways provides simple on-boarding and day-to-day management that is purpose-built for certain small and medium-sized businesses looking to outsource their on-ramp to the internet. The company helps such businesses offload the complexities of cloud infrastructure while letting them spend more time running and scaling their businesses.
Cloudways was co-founded by its CEO Aaqib Gadit — an electronics major from Karachi’s NED University of Engineering and Technology — in 2012 as a “fully bootstrapped next-generation multi-cloud managed application hosting platform”.
Mr Gadit didn’t respond to a request for comment.

3,Hascol inches closer to loan restructuring,The oil marketing company has been in financial trouble since 2018.,"KARACHI: Hascol Petroleum Ltd said on Wednesday its board has approved a plan for rehabilitating the company through restructuring and settlement of liabilities.
The oil marketing company has been in financial trouble since 2018. Its revenues have plummeted, losses risen and loans skyrocketed, sending its share price down from over Rs300 four years ago to less than Rs7 apiece now.
The oil marketing firm told its shareholders its board has also approved the draft of a letter that’ll be sent to all creditors, banks and financial institutions conveying the management-prepared rehabilitation plan. The letter will also contain the process that the company intends to follow through a scheme of arrangement to be presented to the Sindh High Court.
The scheme will be subject to approval by creditors and shareholders as well as the sanction by the court, it added.
At the end of 2021, the company had claimed it was about to conclude negotiations with its bankers to address its “heavy burden of accumulated debt”.
The restructuring effort is focused on replacing short-term expensive debt with long-term affordable debt as well as some new equity.
Its net loss amounted to Rs7.57 billion for calendar year 2021 versus a net loss of Rs23.54bn in 2020. The company also discovered last year “inaccurate entries in its 2019 accounts” and subsequently restated its results from 2018 through 2020.
Regulatory actions against the company in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for unauthorised storage and selling of petroleum products marred its reputation last year. The company also attracted unfavourable attention from investors after a series of abrupt resignations by auditors as well as members of its board and senior management came to the fore last year.
As part of its plan to regain financial strength, the company is trying to convince banks to “partially convert their outstanding debt into equity” in order to reduce its “onerous debt service obligations”.
Besides, the management is looking for a “significant reduction” in its operating costs, recapturing its market share, disposal of non-core assets, shoring up of working capital and the raising of additional equity to reduce leverage.
The company’s major shareholder is Vitol Group, which increased its equity stake from 25pc to 40pc in 2020.
The company hasn’t released its detailed financial accounts for 2021. Its short-term borrowings alone amounted to Rs33bn in 2020, down 10.7pc from the preceding year. According to the notes attached to the 2020 financial statements, these short-term loans from different banks were at interest rates ranging from one-month Karachi interbank offered rate (Kibor) plus 1.5pc to as high as Kibor plus 20pc.
In a separate statement released earlier this week, Hascol Petroleum Ltd said the company posted positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of Rs1.35bn in 2021 versus a negative EBITDA of Rs11.7bn a year ago — a feat that the oil marketer attributed to the credit support to Vitol in the midst of “non-availability of capital lines from banks”.
“The company’s board and management very much hope that over the next few months Hascol Petroleum Ltd will be put on a sound footing for the years ahead,” it added.

4,Yields on T-bills raised by 5bps,"The government raised Rs828 billion through T-bills, including Rs48.3bn as non-competitive bids.","KARACHI: The government on Wednesday incre­ased the cut-off yields on treasury bills to raise more than the auction target.

5,Pandemic pushed back fight against poverty: ADB,"By 2030, the prevalence of extreme poverty in the region is expected to drop below one per cent, says report.","ISLAMABAD: The Covid-19 pandemic has set back the fight against poverty in Asia and the Pacific by at least two years, and many in the region will likely find it harder than before to escape poverty, an Asian Development Bank (ADB) report released on Wednesday said.
The region’s economic growth this year is expected to reduce extreme poverty — defined as living off less than $1.90 a day — to a level that would have been achieved in 2020 had the pandemic not happened, according to the “Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2022” report. 
Data simulations also show that people in the region with lower pre-pandemic levels of social mobility — the ability to escape poverty — may experience longer-lasting setbacks.
By 2030, the prevalence of extreme poverty in the region is expected to drop below one per cent. At the same time, about 25pc of the population is projected to achieve at least middle-class status, defined as having an income or consumption of $15 or more a day, adjusted for purchasing power parity.
However, this outlook is threatened by differences in social mobility as well as other uncertainties. Developing Asia faces the potential for stagflation, ongoing conflicts involving key global actors, increased food insecurity, and energy price shocks, the ADB report said. 
The Covid-19 crisis interrupted a long trend of poverty reduction in Asia and the Pacific. Although economies are recovering, progress is uneven. The pandemic may also have worsened forms of poverty beyond income, such as food insecurity and inadequate access to health services and education, according to the report.
“The poor and the vulnerable have been hit hardest by Covid-19, and while economies are recovering, many people may find that getting out of poverty is even more difficult than before,” said ADB Chief Economist Albert Park. “Governments in the region should focus on resilience, innovation, and inclusiveness to provide more balanced economic opportunities and greater social mobility for everyone.”
Meanwhile, about 7pc of the region’s residents are forecast to be moderately poor, and about 25pc may be regarded as economically vulnerable at the same milestone. On the other hand, forecasts suggest that about 43pc may be economically secure and another 25pc classified as middle class by 2030.
Among developing Asian economies with available data, about 69pc had a less equitable distribution of economic prospects than what the level of income inequality prior to the Covid-19 pandemic implied. This suggests that, even before the pandemic, the magnitude of long-term disparities between the poor and non-poor were greater than what the level of income inequality showed in many parts of the region.
Data from surveys conducted by the ADB Institute shows that many Asians experienced varying degrees of social mobility in the first 12 months of the pandemic.
