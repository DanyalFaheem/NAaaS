0,Biden orders strikes against ‘Iran-backed militias’ in Syria,Tehran says it has deployed forces in Syria at the invitation of Damascus and only as advisers.,"WASHINGTON: Presi­dent Joe Biden on Tuesday ordered air strikes in eastern Syria targeting “facilities used by Iranian-backed militias”, a US military spokesman said.
The strikes in oil-rich Deir Ezzor province “targeted infrastructure facilities used by groups affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps”, Central Command (Centcom) spokesman Colonel Joe Buccino claimed in a statement.
Buccino said the “precision strikes are intended to defend and protect US forces from attacks like the ones on August 15 against US personnel by Iran-backed groups”, when a number of drones targeted an outpost of US-led anti-jihadist forces without causing any casualties.
Tuesday’s air strikes hit nine bunkers in a complex used for ammunition storage and logistics, the colonel told CNN separately.

Tehran says it has deployed forces in Syria at the invitation of Damascus and only as advisers

The US military had originally intended to hit 11 of 13 bunkers in the complex but called off strikes on two after groups of people were seen near them, he said, adding an initial assessment indicated no one had been killed.
US forces “took proportionate, deliberate action intended to limit the risk of escalation and minimise the risk of casualties”, the Centcom statement said.
“The United States does not seek conflict, but will continue to take necessary measures to protect and defend our people.” Hundreds of American troops are deployed in Syria’s northeast as part of a coalition focused on fighting remnants of the militant Islamic State group.
There was no immediate confirmation of the US strikes from Syrian state media.
Earlier, Iranian state media said a Revolutionary Guard general “who was on a mission in Syria as a military adviser” had been killed on Sunday.
The reports did not say how the general was killed, only describing him as a “defender of the sanctuary”, a term used for those who work on behalf of Iran in Syria or Iraq.
Iran says it has deployed its forces in Syria at the invitation of Damascus and only as advisers.
The Islamic Revolut­ionary Guards Corps is the ideological arm of the Iranian military and is blacklisted as a “terrorist” group by the United States.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on Wednesday said the strikes killed six fighters that were guarding the targeted facilities.
The monitor, which relies on a wide network of sources in Syria, said it could not immediately determine the nationalities of those killed.
It said that Iran-backed Afghan Shia fighters are among the groups operating in the region.
Arms depots and a training camp for Iran-backed militia fighters were among the targets hit, according to the monitor.

1,More internet outages expected in coming days,PTCL blames heavy machinery used to clear floodwaters for damage to cables.,"ISLAMABAD: Internet users are expected to face more outages in the coming days as draining out of floodwater, which is causing cuts and damages to fibre-optic cables, continues in upper Sindh.
A technical report submitted by Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) to the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecom on Wednesday stated that repeated internet outages were mainly because of flood relief efforts in Sukkur division where fibre-optic cables were being damaged mainly by heavy machinery used to clear water in Sindh.
Taking notice of repeated internet outages in recent days, the ministry had sought technical reports from PTCL as well as the telecom sector regulator — Pakistan Tele­communication Authority (PTA).
The PTA said the multiple cuts in fibre-optic cables were not due to any sabotage or criminal activity but because of digging of trenches at various places to divert or drain out floodwater.

PTCL blames heavy machinery used to clear floodwaters for damage to cables

The PTCL report said the last disruptions in internet service reported on Aug 22 and 23 were due to multiple cuts in Ghotki, Khairpur and Sukkur districts. The most serious damage was reported in tehsil Ranipur of Khairpur district.
Talking to Dawn, Minister for IT and Telecom Syed Aminul Haque said initial reports suggested that the situation was serious and more such incidents could be expected in near future.
“Due to extensive flooding, most of the pathways of underground cables have been submerged, as relief workers or locals were trying to divert floodwater by digging trenches on roads and footpaths,” he added.
“The ministry has directed PTCL to declare an emergency so that repair work could be initiated when any such incident is reported in the system, while the PTA is constantly monitoring the quality of service,” the minister said.
The total internet usage in Pakistan was around six terabytes, mainly supplied through seven submarine internet cable systems, of which four are operated by PTCL, two by Transworld Associates and a new cable system that recently came online, owned by a Chinese company. Almost 80 per cent of this internet traffic comes through more than 50,000km widespread PTCL network.
PTCL’s cable network has a capacity to carry 6.5-terabyte data, but only 70pc of the total capacity is utilised so that traffic could be shifted to other cables in case of damages.
Apart from its own retail internet service, a large number of internet service providers (ISPs), including the Storm Fibre and Nayatel, buy bulk internet from PTCL, and any damage to the company’s cable system results in internet service disruptions and degradation for customers of other ISPs too.
A senior official of the ministry said cable damages and service degradations are reported almost daily, but the situation becomes serious when optic-fibre cables get hit. “As the cables were damaged in upper Sindh, the internet service in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and some areas of Balochistan was affected, but there was no such issue for consumers in Karachi, Hyderabad, Gwadar and other districts of southern Sindh,” the official said.

2,Pakistan terms Indian report on missile firing deficient,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday rejected Indian investigation report about the March 9 missile incident and the...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday rejected Indian investigation report about the March 9 missile incident and the sacking of three Indian Air Force officers as “unsatisfactory, deficient and inadequate” and reiterated its demand for a joint probe.
“As expected, the measures taken by India in the aftermath of the incident and the subsequent findings and punishments handed by the so-called internal Court of Inquiry are totally unsatisfactory, deficient and inadequate,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.
Indian Air Force had a day earlier said that the Court of Inquiry (Col), which investigated the missile incident, found out that violation of Standard Operating Procedures by three officers had caused the “accidental firing of the missile”.
The three officers found guilty of the SOPs breach were terminated from service.
Pakistan had at the time of the formation of CoI rejected it, saying it needed to be involved in the investigation as the missile had struck a site on its territory.
The FO statement said: “Pakistan categorically rejects India’s purported closure of the highly irresponsible incident and reiterates its demand for a joint probe.”
“Systemic loopholes and technical lapses of serious nature in handling of strategic weapons cannot be covered up beneath the veneer of individual human error. If indeed India has nothing to hide then it must accept Pakistan’s demand for a joint probe in the spirit of transparency,” the statement emphasised.
Meanwhile, Pakistan has strongly condemned the “highly provocative and sacrilegious remarks” made by a BJP leader against the Holy Prophet (PBUH), APP reported.
The “highly derogatory remarks have gravely hurt the feelings of the people of Pakistan and billions of Muslims around the world,” the FO spokesperson said.

3,US announces $3bn in military aid for Ukraine,Norway offers micro drones; British PM pledges more military support to Kyiv on its Independence Day.,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden announced nearly $3 billion in military aid — the biggest US package so far — on Kyiv’s Independence Day, as officials warned that Russia appeared to be planning to launch fresh attacks in coming days on Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure and government facilities.
“The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty,” Biden said in a statement while announcing the package on Wednesday.
The new package uses funds from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) appropriated by Congress to allow the Biden administration to procure weapons from industry rather than taking weapons from existing US weapons stocks.
The US president hailed its resistance against Russian invasion and said the $2.98 billion for arms and other equipment aimed “to ensure Ukraine can continue to defend itself over the long term”. The approximately $2.98 billion in assistance “will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term,” he said.

Norway offers micro drones; British PM pledges more military support to Kyiv on its Independence Day

The Pentagon said the new package would include six additional surface-to-air missile systems known as NASAMS, 24 counter-artillery radars, Puma drones, along with counter-drone systems known as VAMPIRE.
In total, the United States has committed more than $13.5 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the beginning of the Biden administration in January 2021.
Thousands of soldiers on both sides and thousands of civilians have died in the largest-scale battles seen in Europe since World War II.
“Six months of relentless attacks have only strengthened Ukrainians’ pride in themselves, in their country, and in their thirty-one years of independence,” Biden said.
‘Ukraine reborn’
Marking the 31 years of his country’s independence from the Soviet Union on Wednesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in his speech vowed to drive Russian forces out completely, saying that Ukraine was “reborn” when it was invaded six months ago.
The 44-year-old leader, speaking in front of Kyiv’s central monument to independence in his trademark combat fatigues, vowed to recapture occupied areas of eastern Ukraine as well as the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.
“We will not sit down at the negotiating table out of fear, with a gun pointed at our heads. For us, the most terrible iron is not missiles, aircraft and tanks, but shackles. Not trenches, but fetters,” he said.
Boris visits Kyiv
Western countries offered Ukraine more military support, with Norway saying it and Britain would supply micro drones to help with target identification.
In Kyiv, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson met President Zelenskiy on Wednesday to mark the country’s independence day, promising a further package of military support.
Johnson’s office said in a statement that the 54 million pound ($63.5 million) package would include 200 drones and loitering munitions to enable the Ukrainian military to better track and target invading Russian forces.
“The UK will continue to stand with our Ukrainian friends. I believe Ukraine can and will win this war,” Johnson, who has less than two weeks left as prime minister, said on Twitter.

4,Court suspends Thai PM from office,Former army chief Prawit Wongsuwan will take over as caretaker premier.,"BANGKOK: Thailand’s Constitutional Court on Wednesday suspended Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha from office while it considers a legal challenge that could see him thrown out months before an expected general election.
The court agreed unanimously to hear a case brought by opposition parties that argue Prayut has reached the end of his eight-year term limit as premier.
Judges also agreed by five votes to four to suspend Prayut from office until the case is decided, the court stated.
“The court considered the petition and supporting documents and deems the facts according to the request indicate reasonable grounds to suspect that there is a case as requested,” the statement added.

Former army chief Prawit Wongsuwan will take over as caretaker premier

“Thus, a majority vote (five against four) for (Prayut) to be suspended as prime minister, effective August 24, 2022, until the court issues a verdict.”
While Prayut, who will continue in his role as defence minister, has 15 days to respond to the case against him, Prawit Wongsuwan, one of Prayut’s deputies and another former army chief, will take over as caretaker prime minister while the case is decided.
“The current cabinet will continue its duty as normal because General Prayut has not been ousted from his post, only suspended from duty,” said Wissanu Krea-ngam, another deputy prime minister. Pita Limjaroenrat, leader of the opposition Move Forward Party which backed the petition, said the country needed fresh leadership. “It is like rowing a boat round the bathtub, going from General Prayut to General Prawit,” Pita told reporters at parliament.
It is not the first time the Constitutional Court has played a role in Thai politics — it cancelled the results of general elections in 2006 and 2014.
The kingdom’s 2017 constitution bars the prime minister from serving more than eight years in total, and opposition parties say Prayut, who took power in a 2014 coup, has reached the limit.
Anti-govt protests
Several hundred anti-government protesters rallied at Bangkok’s Democracy Monument on Tuesday ahead of the court ruling and further demonstrations are planned.
On Wednesday, police placed shipping containers on some streets near government buildings in anticipation of fresh protests.
Anucha Burachaisri, a spokesman for the prime minister’s office, urged “all groups” to “respect the results of the court’s hearings and avoid criticising the performance of the court”.
Supporters of the 68-year-old leader argue that the clock on his rule began when the 2017 constitution was instituted, or even after the 2019 general election. If the court follows this logic, Prayut could technically continue to serve until 2025 or 2027, in case he wins a general election due by March.

5,Germany inaugurates world’s first hydrogen-powered rail fleet,Trains will mix hydrogen fuel on board with oxygen present in the air to produce power.,"

A TRAIN powered entirely by hydrogen is pictured in Bremervoerde city on Wednesday.—AFP

 
BERLIN: Germany on Wednesday inaugurated a railway line powered entirely by hydrogen, a “world premiere” and a major step forward for green train transport despite nagging supply challenges.
A fleet of 14 trains provided by French industrial giant Alstom to the German state Lower Saxony has replaced diesel locomotives on the 100 kilometres of track connecting the cities of Cuxhaven, Bremer­haven, Bremervoerde and Buxtehude near Hamburg. “We are very proud to put this technology into operation together with our strong partners as a world premiere,” Alstom CEO Henri Poupart-Lafarge said.
Hydrogen trains have become a promising way to decarbonise the rail sector and replace climate-warming diesel, which still powers 20 per cent of journeys in Germany.
Billed as a “zero emission” mode of transport, the trains mix hydrogen on board with oxygen present in the ambient air, thanks to a fuel cell installed in the roof. This produces the electricity needed to pull the train.

Trains will mix hydrogen fuel on board with oxygen present in the air to produce power

Regional rail operator LNVG said the fleet, which cost 93 million euros (dollars), would prevent 4,400 tonnes of CO2 being released into the atmosphere each year.
Run for its money
Designed in the southern French town of Tarbes and assembled in Salzgitter in central Germany, Alstom’s trains — called Coradia iLint — are trailblazers in the sector.
The project created jobs for up to 80 employees in the two countries, according to Alstom.
Commercial trials have been carried out since 2018 on the line with two hydrogen trains, but now the entire fleet is adopting the groundbreaking technology.
The French group has inked four contracts for several dozen trains between Germany, France and Italy, with no sign of demand waning.
In Germany alone “between 2,500 and 3,000 diesel trains could be replaced by hydrogen models”, Stefan Schrank, project manager at Alstom, believed.
“By 2035, around 15 to 20 per cent of the regional European market could run on hydrogen,” according to Alexandre Charpentier, a rail expert at consultancy Roland Berger.
Hydrogen trains are particularly attractive on short regional lines where the cost of a transition to electric outstrips the profitability of the route. Currently, around one of two regional trains in Europe runs on diesel.
But Alstom’s competitors are ready to give it a run for its money. German behemoth Siemens unveiled a prototype hydrogen train with national rail company Deutsche Bahn in May, with a view to a roll-out in 2024.
But, despite the attractive prospects, “there are real barriers” to a big expansion with hydrogen, Charpentier said.
For starters, trains are not the only means of transport hungry for the fuel.
The entire sector, whether it be road vehicles or aircraft, not to mention heavy industry such as steel and chemicals, is eyeing hydrogen to slash CO2 emissions.
Colossal investment
Although Germany announced in 2020 an ambitious seven-billion-euro plan to become a leader in hydrogen technologies within a decade, the infrastructure is still lacking in Europe’s top economy.
It is a problem seen across the continent, where colossal investment would be needed for a real shift to hydrogen. “For this reason, we do not foresee a 100 per cent replacement of diesel trains with hydrogen,” Charpentier said.
Also, hydrogen is not necessarily carbon-free: only “green hydrogen”, produced using renewable energy, is considered sustainable by experts. Other, more common manufacturing methods exist, but they emit greenhouse gases because they are made from fossil fuels.
The Lower Saxony line will have to use a hydrogen by-product of certain industries such as the chemical sector in the beginning.
The French research institute IFP specialising in energy issues says that hydrogen is currently “95 per cent derived from the transformation of fossil fuels, almost half of which come from natural gas”.
Europe’s enduring reliance on gas from Russia amid massive tensions over the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine poses major challenges for the development of hydrogen in rail transport. “Political leaders will have to decide which sector to prioritise when determining what the production of hydrogen will or won’t go to,” Charpentier said.
Germany will also have to import massively to meet its needs.
While partnerships have recently been signed with India and Morocco, Chancellor Olaf Scholz sealed a green hydrogen deal with Canada on a visit this week, laying a path for a transatlantic supply chain.
