Informed sources said that diseases had already began to hit almost every locality and there was an alarming surge in cases of dengue, malaria, cholera, diarrhoea and dysentery due to highly unhygienic conditions across the city.
They said that dengue and malaria were spreading like epidemic due to breeding mosquitoes, while the cases of cholera, diarrhoea and dysentery were increasing mainly due to flies, ponds and puddles of filthy water and stinking heaps of garbage.
The sources in the major government hospitals of the city confirmed that the cases of dengue, malaria, diarrhoea and cholera were continuously increasing in the city.

Officials say frequent rounds of fumigation and removal of sewage, stagnant rainwater required to achieve results

They said that over 1,345 cases of dengue had been reported in the province in a year, of which 1,049 were related to Karachi.
According to the health department sources, 25 cases of dengue were being reported daily in the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi, 20 in the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and two cases were being reported daily in the Sindh Government Hospital, Liaquatabad till Aug 21.
They said that five cases of cholera were being reported in the CHK and 10 in JPMC, while 49, 111 cases of malaria were reported in Sindh this year, of which 550 were related to Karachi.
Besides, the sources said, more than 229,591 cases of diarrhoea in children under five years of age, and 264,940 cases of diarrhoea in people above five years of age had been reported in the province since March this year.
They said that 25,927 cases of dysentery among children under five years of age, and 34,991 cases among people above five years of age had been reported since March.
Need for constant fumigation
Sources in the KMC’s municipal services department told Dawn that the fumigation drives could not yield required results until the filth and sewage in the city was breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies. They said that repeated rounds of fumigation were required to get rid of insects.
They conceded that the desired results of the ongoing fumigation drive might not be achieved in the presence of filthy stagnant water and oozing sewage in the city, especially in the cloudy weather.
The sources said that the fumigation campaign would be more effective with sufficient sunlight.
They said that the KMC had sufficient anti-insect chemical for spray in the entire city for the ongoing fumigation drive. However, they said, the city’s municipality would need more chemical so that the fumigation could be carried out repeatedly.
They said that the anti-insect chemical was sprayed by the KMC and DMCs across the city during the fumigation drive that was launched in the second week of August from district Central and culminated in the third week of the current month on the city’s outskirts within the jurisdiction of District Council Karachi.
KMC Municipal Services Director Mazhar Khan told Dawn that 25 spray vehicles carried out the fumigation in seven districts of the city. “The spray was carried out in the evening timing which is ideal for killing insects,” he said, adding that one district was covered daily during the campaign.
He said that the administration of all DMCs and District Council Karachi deputed officers to supervise the fumigation drive. “They were also directed to submit their respective reports in this regard,” he added.
THe KMC had procured 6,000 litres of Deltamethrin, a broad-spectrum insecticide that kills a wide range of insects and pests, including mosquitoes and flies. “We still have sufficient chemical which is also being given to DMCs for fumigation in their respective jurisdictions,” he added.

He stated that the prime responsibility of a lawyer was to facilitate the court for the decision of a case in accordance with law.
He said this while speaking at the graduation ceremony of students of the Denning Law School at a local hotel on Saturday.
He said that the esteemed profession of law was not meant for money only and advised the fresh graduates that while advocating the cases of “haves” with handsome professional fee, they should also dedicate sometime for fighting rights of “have nots”, who may not have the capacity to pay their desired fee.
He further stated that patience, courage and tolerance were the best tools of a good lawyer including the courtesy with opposite lawyer because harsh attitude left no good gesture and therefore the attitude must be within the professional ethics.
A good lawyer cannot fight unless he knows the factual position of the case, he said and further asked the young lawyers to avoid scandalous pleadings and concealment of fact from the court.
“In the early stage of your career, you should dedicate your precious time to the profession for learning good advocacy rather than wasting your time in the bar rooms,” Justice Mazhar advised the newly graduated law students.
“Basically, it is on job training and each day you will learn something new in the courtrooms and every case would be a new challenge and test for you in which either you will win or lose, but the result depends on your legal acumen and preparation of your brief,” it added.
Retired Justice Sajjad Ali Shah of the Supreme Court and several judges of Sindh High Court also attended the ceremony.

They said that Fahim Habib Baloch was sitting at his book shop, Ilm-u-Adab Publishers, on Friday evening when he was taken away.
Quoting witnesses, they said that the men in civvies politely asked Mr Baloch as to whether he had sent books to Germany. They told him that their senior sitting in his vehicle parked outside wanted to meet him. They took him and since then his whereabouts were not known, the friends and rights activists said.
Parveen Naz of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) said that Mr Baloch, also a member of the rights body, had been publishing the Sada-i-Balochistan magazine.
She said Baloch’s cousin, Umme Habib, who is also a lawyer, had approached the Preedy police station but they refused to receive her written complaint. Later, she sent the application through a courier company.
However, Preedy SHO Mohammed Sajjad Khan told Dawn they did not receive any application. He said that the police were aware of the report regarding disappearance of one Fahim Baloch.
In his written complaint sent to the inspector general of police and SSP-South, Ms Habib narrated the incident.
She said she came to Karachi from Uthal after receiving information about her brother’s disappearance and wanted to lodge an FIR. 
She said her brother is also a government employee.

3,Met office forecasts break in wet spell,Weather in Karachi is likely to remain partly cloudy with chances of light rain.,"KARACHI: The monsoon low after producing torrential rains in upper Sindh and northeast Balochistan has subsided and chances of development of any significant weather system till the first week of September are too low, stated a Met official on Saturday.
“There is some [monsoon current] circulation over the Arabian Sea that may lead to light to moderate rain in western Sindh including Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Larkana and Qambar-Shahdadkot and parts of Balochistan. However, we are unlikely to have any significant [monsoon] weather system in the coming days even in the northern parts of the country till Sept 3-4,” said chief meteorologist Dr Sardar Safaraz.
This break in the wet spell would facilitate flood relief efforts, particularly in Balochistan, he added.
According to the department, weather in Karachi is likely to remain partly cloudy with chances of light rain today in the morning or night. The maximum temperature is likely to range between 31 degrees Celsius and 34 degrees Celsius.

4,‘Mafia occupying land in city in garb of flood-hit people’,"MQM-P, PSP ask people to donate for flood victims","KARACHI: Pak Sarzameen Party chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal on Friday expressed his concern over exploitation of the flood situation by “certain powerful mafia” and said that it was already grabbing private and state lands in Karachi in the name of settlement of flood-affected people of rural parts of the province.
“In the name of flood victims, the powerful mafia has started seizing the lands in Karachi,” he said while speaking at a press conference at his party’s Pakistan House headquarters. “The law enforcement agencies should take immediate notice; otherwise the situation could turn out of control.” 
Mr Kamal also appealed to the people of Karachi to donate for the flood-affected people keeping their past tradition.
He also shared the concern over “ineffectiveness” of the administration in the flood-hit areas to keep a check on hoarders and profiteers, who were already exploiting the situation. 

MQM-P, PSP ask people to donate for flood victims 

He said that the people should come forward in these challenging times to help their brothers and sisters but at the same time, it’s the responsibility of the authorities to keep the process transparent.
He demanded that the government put an effective system in place to monitor the performance of the district administrations across the province. 
The absence of such system, he feared, would lead to financial corruption and misappropriation of funds, which were expected to flow in after a countrywide appeal for the assistance.
He also called for an effective local government system arguing that without such mechanism the situation would get more dreadful in coming days as many more would die of hunger than the floods.
“The recent floods have caused more damage than the devastating earthquake of 2005, but the prime minister, chief minister and senior officials will only be able to make estimation on the devastation without local governments,” he said.
MQM-P appeals for donation
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) also appealed for funds and donation from the people of Karachi while initiating its relief operation in Sindh and Balochistan under its charity wing. 
It said that many party volunteers had already left for the flood-hit areas while efforts here in the city were under way for dispatching relief goods, recruiting more volunteers and arranging resources for the calamity-hit districts of the two provinces.
“Our workers are already in the flood-hit areas and we have set up camps across Karachi appealing the people of this city to come forward and help those in need. It’s time to show unity keeping all political and ideological differences aside,” MQM-P convenor Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui told a press conference at the party’s temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad.
The MQM-P had set up cams in different parts of the city, including its temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad.

5,Stage play about relationship woes opens,Both Sit in Silence for a While is being staged at Napa,"KARACHI: The reason Mark Twain once said that “there’s no such thing as a new idea” is that from time immemorial human beings have had a limited range of ‘personal’ issues to deal with — love, death, penury, feud, disease, intrigue and infidelity. When the creative lot picks one or two of them to express themselves, it all boils down to presentation. 
The waning affection between a man and a woman who once loved each other and cohabited amicably is one such topic, effectively highlighted in Avery Corman’s novel Kramer Versus Kramer,which was adopted into an Oscar-winning movie in the late 1970s. Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the world, the tension between the sexes and the significance of mental health has one more time come to the fore as a veritable subject to mull over — the high divorce rate is a testimony to the observation. 
The play Both Sit in Silence for a While written and directed by Ali Junejo that opened its three-day run in Karachi at the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) on Friday evening is another attempt to examine the dynamics between a warring couple, played by Junejo and Rasti Farooq. 
The setting is minimalistic, a bit claustrophobic, which is perhaps intentional to show the paucity of space between the two characters. The audience is sitting so close to the actors that they become part of the incessant tit-for-tit bombardment of arguments that both the man and the woman unleash at each other with varying degrees of exasperation and annoyance. 

Both Sit in Silence for a While is being staged at Napa 

It becomes apparent from the get go that the differences, which they have developed, are almost irreconcilable. In the midst of it all is their child, not physically present in the theatrical scheme of things, who they seem to worry about in ways that oscillate between pure parental care and a hint of selfishness — an intelligent method to blur the line of what’s imagined and unimagined. 
It is a noble idea to convey because if you are a couple with children, the biggest victim of the break-up is the kids — they seldom fully recover from it. This is where you need to decide between personal freedom and collective growth.
The thing is, even noble ideas sometimes need to be communicated convincingly. Both Sit in Silence for a While is written in a way that it comes across as acting-heavy than subject-centred. Nothing wrong with that, but Farooq sometimes smothers her lines in a hurry to say them.
The dialogue is linear, and again there’s nothing wrong with that as long as the implied or evident metaphor is powerful. 
Junejo is a one of the formidable theatre practitioners that we have in this country. He has done some memorable work in the past, including in a two-hander, Constellations directed by Gregory Thompson at the same venue. So he knows the nitty-gritty and the pitfalls of such an undertaking. His performance as an actor on Friday had many moments of praiseworthiness. As a writer, he needs to dig a bit deeper. Just a bit.

6,Asad Umar moves SHC against ECP notice,KARACHI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf general secretary Asad Umar on Saturday moved the Sindh High Court impugning a...,"KARACHI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf general secretary Asad Umar on Saturday moved the Sindh High Court impugning a notice issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan for allegedly using contemptuous remarks.
Through a petition, he submitted that the ECP had issued a notice, dated Aug 19, under Section 10 of the Election Act, 2017, for use of intemperate, unparliamentarily language and contemptuous remakes against the ECP and chief election commissioner.
He contended that the relevant provision contained in the Election Act was clearly in violation of the Constitution and thereof Section 10 (power to punish for contempt) was ultra vires to the Constitution and maintained that Articles 204 and 175 were very categorical regarding the definition of a court and its powers.
He further submitted that as per Article 175(2), ‘no court shall have any jurisdiction save as or may be conferred by the constitution or by or under any law’.
According to the Election Act, it does not give any jurisdiction to the ECP to act as a court or a tribunal, whereas it only may exercise the power of high court to punish any person for contempt of court, the petitioner maintained.
He further contended that the Constitution being the prime supra law, cannot be violated by any subservient law, while there was a procedure in the Election Rules 2017 regarding contempt of the commission which was again made in contravention of the Constitution.
The petitioner also referred to Article 19 and submitted that every citizen has a right to freedom of speech and expression and pleaded to declare Section 10 of Election Act ultra vires to the Constitution and the impugned notice cannot be acted being in excess in of jurisdiction and authority of ECP.
He also sought a restraining order for the ECP not to take any action or proceeding against him in the light of the impugned notice till the pendency of this petition.
Later, talking to media, Mr Umar said that the issue of fund-raising for the flood-affected people by the party chief was under discussion and a decision in this regard was expected soon.
He said federal Finance Minister Miftah Ismail was blaming PTI for sabotaging the IMF deal, while former prime minister Nawaz Sharif himself was deposing about the incompetence of Mr Ismail.

7,IO gets more time to file final charge sheet in DHA high-rise death case,IO says investigation is still incomplete.,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Saturday directed the investigating officer to submit the final charge sheet against six suspects booked and arrested over the death of their young friend, who died after falling from a multi-storey residential building in Defence Housing Authority Phase-VIII last month.
Police booked and detained Syed Muhammad Ammar, Usman Ahmed, Owais, Uzair Ahmed, Ahmed Jamil, and Syed Faaz following the death of their 26-year-old friend, Adil Masood Khan, on July 31.
On Saturday, the IO was set to file the charge sheet before Judicial Magistrate (South) Mazhar Ali, who on the previous date had issued a show-cause notice to the former over his failure to submit final charge sheet despite the lapse of stipulated time.
However, IO Abdul Raheem appeared and requested for more time to enable him to submit the final charge sheet, stating that the investigation was still incomplete.
Granting the request, the magistrate told the IO to submit the final charge sheet on the next date and adjourned the matter till Aug 31.
The IO had filed an interim charge sheet against the six detained men for allegedly committing manslaughter of their friend.
However, the charge sheet was silent about the alleged commission of murder of the victim despite the incorporation of Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code in the case by the IO, earlier.
Without elaborating the commissioning of the alleged murder, the IO had stated that during the course of the investigation he found no evidence to suggest that the deceased was “pushed off” from the high-rise residential building or there was any “resentment” between him and the suspects.
The charge sheet merely stated that blood samples of the suspects had been sent to the University of Karachi’s International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences (ICCBS) for chemical examination.
The IO listed 14 witnesses, including the complainant. However, he showed owner of the flat, where the alleged drug party took place, as absconder.
Masood had died after falling from the high-rise building near Do Darya under mysterious circumstances on the morning of July 31.
A case under Sections 322 (manslaughter) and 34 (common intention) of the PPC was registered against his friends at the Darakhshan police station on the complaint of the victim’s sister, Varda Masood.
She alleged that the six detained friend of her brother left him unattended in injured condition and the building’s management had shifted him to the hospital, but he could not survive.
Police claimed that the youth had rented the apartment for one night where they were having a party when Masood went to the balcony from where he fell.

9,Murad orders arrest of agents for fleecing rain-hit families,Says repair of road networks in Karachi to cost Rs50bn.,"UMERKOT: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali on Thursday expressed his outrage over complaints by people affected by rain and flood in Umerkot that they were being fleeced by the “agents” who were supposed to transfer financial aid to individuals’ accounts under the Benazir Income Support Programme. The CM ordered police to get these extortionists arrested and take them to task.
The chief minister heard people’s complaints while visiting different affected areas in Umerkot to assess the situation and inquire from affected families about their wellbeing and issues.
Some women told him that the agents were transferring only Rs22,000 into their BISP accounts instead of Rs25,000. They said when they asked the agents about the deduction of Rs3,000, they described the same as “service charges”.
CM Shah expressed his outrage over the extortion and remarked: “This is unacceptable and uncalled for … I’ll not tolerate this act of fleecing people in distress”. He said it was quite annoying to see that such elements did not spare even homeless and displaced people. 

Says repair of road networks in Karachi to cost Rs50bn

He discussed the issue with the officials concerned while presiding over a meeting at Umerkot deputy commissioner’s office and asked the Mirpurkhas DIG to ensure that the culprits were arrested and taken to task. 
The meeting reviewed the widespread devastation caused by heavy rains and the relief measures taken by the government. It was attended by provincial ministers, Syed Sardar Shah, Nasir Shah, Taimour Talpur, Mukesh Chawla and MNAs and MPAs from the area, besides Commissioner Aijaz Shah, DC Tahir Memon and DIG Zulfikar Mahar. 
The meeting also discussed the issue of restoration of natural waterways in the province. 
Mr Shah said that a study was conducted after the 2011 floods which had revealed that Rs28 billion were required for the project. “We are working [for the restoration of old and natural waterways] but funds would be arranged through donor agencies,” he said, adding that Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah had already started work on it. 
The CM said that his government had ordered procurement of 350,000 tents against a requirement of one million units. “No firm is ready to take the order for immediate delivery. Therefore, brother countries like China, Iran and others are being approached in this regard,” he said. 
Some participants of the meeting complained that flood-affected people from Mirpurkhas, Tando Allahyar, Badin and Thar had got themselves settled on the sandy dunes of Umerkot. Mr Shah told them: “They are our guests and must be treated decently and respectfully”. 
Briefing the chief minister about rainfall in different areas and damage, the Mirpurkhas commissioner said that Umerkot district had received 570mm rains, Kunri 644mm, Samaro 676mm and Pithoro 337mm. Four people died and 10 others injured in rain-related incidents in the district.
The downpour submerged cotton and other crops standing over 88,885 acres, damaged 60,300 houses. As many as 1,135 animals perished in the rain and flooding. 
He stated that over 400,000 people were displaced and 4,923 of them had been shifted to 32 relief camps, where regular provision of food and medical aid was being ensured. 
The PDMA provided 4,600 tents, 7,000 mosquito nets, 2,500 ration bags, 1,000 Tarpals, 2,200 jerry canes, besides 2,000 mosquito nets for cattle. 
In Mirpurkhas district, the CM was told, heavy rains affected 662 dehs. Some 12 breaches developed in drains and they were plugged timely. 
The rains also damaged 605.62kms roads, 83 culverts and two bridges. 
Referring to the overall situation in Sindh, the chief minister told the elected representatives present at the meeting that he had informed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that 308mm more rainfall than normal had been recorded. In August alone, the province received 784pc more rain than average rainfall. 
Mr Shah said that 23 districts (101 talukas) had been declared ‘calamity-hit’ areas. 
The CM said he told the prime minister that the initial estimate of losses was put at Rs550 billion while 293 unman deaths were registered. Another 836 people sustained injuries. 
According to Mr Shah 1.5 million houses collapsed, 9,197 cattle perished, 2,845,046 acre crops submerged and 570 roads damaged in the rainfall and flooding. 
Mr Shah said that the repair of damaged road networks in Karachi would cost Rs50 billion. 
The chief minister assured the people, particularly affected ones, that they would be looked after properly.

Farmers’ capacity-building would also be done under the project. 
A delegation of the FAO headed by Zabio Grito called on Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority (SIDA) officials on Friday, said a Sida press release, adding that the other members of delegation included Dr Ashfaq Ahmed, Hyder Shabbir, Umer Kousar Malik and Saddam Qureshi. 
The delegation informed Sida officials that FAO wanted to develop a web portal under Green Climate Fund (GCF). This would help farmers acquire knowledge and information about irrigation, agriculture and climate on a daily basis, they said. 
Irrigation managers would also be able to have this information so that they could efficiently run irrigation system, distribute water and handle other tasks. Farmers would be able to continue their agricultural activities accordingly in view of this information. 
Sida general manger (research and development) Ghulam Mustafa Ujjan informed the delegation that Sida did have the geographical and information system cell which was based on the offered technique. This system provides information about statistics regarding barrages, dams, head works and canal water flows on a daily basis. 
He said that efforts were under way to include farmer organisations’ details and numbers as soon as possible. The visiting delegation appreciated working of this cell and offered that FAO would help solve any problem faced in this system.  
The delegation said that a written presentation should be submitted to FAO so that facilitation could be given to Sida. 
It was noted at the meeting that under GCF, FAO had launched projects in Sindh and Punjab to deal with issues relating to climate change, water flows’ measurement figures and problems being faced by irrigation, Sida and agriculture officials. These officials would be provided training under the programme and they would be able to release water-related figures on a daily basis. Such training would help them ensure a judicious distribution of water. 
Sida general manager (operations)  Jairam Das Bhatia and other officials were also present.

11,Larkana faces threat of outbreak due to inundation,Patients suffer as access to CMCH remains blocked,"LARKANA: The stagnant rainwater in most areas of Larkana poses a serious threat of outbreak of water-borne diseases and warrants attention of the administration and other authorities concerned for effective arrangements for the removal of rainwater and sewage. The situation also demands setting up of medical camps to ward off the danger. 
Though rainfall stopped on Friday, the low-lying areas and main arteries of city remained submerged. The water which had already encircled the Chandka Medical College Teaching Hospital has now entered into the main administration building and other departments. Principal of the college Prof Dr Zameer Soomro, talking to Dawn, said not only his office was filled with rainwater, but the adjacent offices and departments were also facing the same situation. Early arrangements to drain out water would be the only option to save main structures from serious damage, he added.
Most residents in Doctors’ Colony, Professors’ Colony and lower staff’s colony were vacated by their residents when they found it risky to stay on, he said. “This is quite an unusual situation which demands extraordinary measures,” he said. 
Improper and ineffective operation of the main water disposal pumping stations has fallen short of clear the huge volume of rainwater. Power outage has aggravated the situation. Feeling the seriousness of the obtaining conditions, people came on roads and held demonstrations. The main Al-Murtaza House road was closed to pump out water while residents of OPF appeared to be the worst-affected area like Sachal Colony, where measures to drain out water were quite delayed. Also closure of gas supply to many areas in Larkana has multiplied grievances of rain-hit residents.

Patients suffer as access to CMCH remains blocked

Indus Highway hit by deluge
The heavy rainfall along with the deluges descending from the Kachho belt caused overtopping and flooding Indus Highway near Dhamraho Wah (irrigation channel), some 30 kilometres from here, close to Nasirabad town. Water is gushing from east and heading towards west with increased pressure, forcing the vehicular traffic to move at a snail’s pace. 
At present, one to two feet high water was overtopping the Indus Highway within about 2.5 furlong length, local people said. Had it not been overtopped, it would have directly hit Nasirabad town, they said. Now both pressure and tension among population were subsiding, they said. The motorway police were monitoring traffic flow on the road.
This water flow would pass from Gaji Khuhawar and after striking against ‘Suprio Bund’ it would deflect to the Main Nara Valley (MNV) Drain. This drain would finally carry the deluge to Manchhar Lake.
DC earns court’s ire
District and Sessions Judge of Larkana Syed Sharafuddian Shah on Friday issued notices to the deputy commissioner and chief municipal officer over their failure to remove rainwater from court’s buildings and other city areas within three days, as was ordered on August 22.
The judge, being the chairman of criminal justice coordination committee, had asked them to remove rainwater by August 25 and file a compliance report. 
“But you did not care, which reflects gross negligence on your part, therefore, the show-cause notice is issued,” the judge said. 
The district and sessions judge has ordered them to appear in person along with their reply on Aug 28 that why proceedings under Section 175 read with Section 186 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) should not initiated against them. “In case of failure, an appropriate order under scheme of law will be passed,” the notice said.
