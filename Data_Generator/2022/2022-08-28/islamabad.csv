This was decided at a meeting held with Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal in the chair on Saturday. 
The meeting was attended by senior officials and representatives from the finance, planning and development, highway departments, Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) Director General Saif Anwar Jappa and Chief Engineer Dr Habib Randhawa.
A senior official privy to the meeting told Dawn that the committee decided that a consultancy firm would be hired which would work on the project in two phases - Phase-I for determination of the optimal route for the economic corridor and Phase II for detailed planning for land use along the third party validated alignment of the Ring Road.
“For the two phases, Rs90 million have been allocated, including Rs30 million for Phase-I and Rs60 million for Phase II,” he said.
He said the economic corridor would be selected keeping in view the components of the economic zone which may include envisaged industrial units, education and health zones, recreational areas, central business districts, theme parks, high-rise building zones and relocation and establishment of commercial markets, truck/bus terminals.
He said traffic management to achieve sustainable and workable factor of futuristic growth of the twin cities shall be added to the scope of assignment.
He said the meeting also decided that the whole process of consultant’s selection would be finalised in 45 days, entailing the completion of Phase-I in 60 days. The assignment of Phase-II should be completed in 90 days and work order of Phase-II to successful bidder will be awarded after completion of the optimal alignment of the road.
He said the meeting agreed that the firms shortlisted by the Planning and Development Department were not in line with the requisite scope of assignment as the firms must have the expertise of road infrastructure and land use. Therefore, he said, it was decided that the invitation of proposals as per the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules would be advertised to hire the firm.
The federal government has enlisted five main projects to fetch foreign investment after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to the UAE.
These projects are: Parco coastal refinery Phase-I oil import terminal, Kharian-Rawalpindi Motorway, Rawalpindi Ring Road, Karachi Circular Railway and connectivity of Thar Block-II with the railway network.
The federal government wanted to bring foreign investment instead of launching the Ring Road project under the annual development programme or through local investors.

1,Capital police conduct raids in Karachi to arrest six staffers of news channel,Sources say authorities believe that Shahbaz Gill was not alone in the ‘conspiracy’.,"ISLAMABAD: The capital police on Saturday made an unsuccessful attempt to arrest six staff members of a news channel in Karachi, sources told Dawn. 
The police conducted raids in different localities of Karachi, including South Zone, but proved unsuccessful, the sources said. 
Majority of the houses raided by the police were found abandoned since long, while few of them were in a deserted place, they said, adding that later they left Karachi for Islamabad. 
The raids were conducted in response to directives from the authorities concerned, the sources said, adding that the authorities believed that Shahbaz Gill was not alone in the ‘conspiracy’. 
Different PTI leaders and some staff members of the news channel have been identified as being involved in hatching the ‘conspiracy’, they added. 
Meanwhile, a decision has also been taken to club the case registered against staff members of the news channel at Karachi’s Memon Goth police station with the one registered at Kohsar police station in Islamabad.
According to the officers, a request is being made to the Sindh government to refer the case registered at Memon Goth police station to Kohsar police station in Islamabad. 
In another move, the capital police approached the FIA Cyber Crime wing to register a case against Shahbaz Gill over his appearance in the controversial news bulletin of the news channel, the officers said.
Besides, the police also requested the FIA to register cases against the social media handler who shared the news bulletin from their accounts as well as those who were sharing their view in favour of Gill as all were creating a bad image of the police. 
However, the FIA Cyber Crime refused to register the case, saying as per the apex court decision announced in 2018, one FIR should be registered in one crime. 
The police spokesman confirmed that the raid was conducted in Karachi to arrest six staff members of the news channel, but refused to give further details.

The seminar, organised by the World Peace Jirga Programme (WPJP) on Saturday, called upon the authorities to extend support to the refugees’ families who were facing serious difficulties in meeting the daily expenses.
The speakers expressed the hope that Pakistan would help Afghan refugees, especially those belonging to the Hazara community who were facing terror attacks almost daily in their native areas.
WPJP leader Rayatullah Khan said he and other Jirga members visited various border areas of the country with Afghanistan and Iran including Chaman, Torkham, Angoor Adda and Kharlachi.
“We strive to reconcile the existing schisms among regional countries to help people living in bordering areas,” he said, adding that trade was the best means for reconciliation among communities and societies. 
Mr Khan said localised commerce activities provided employment opportunities to the deprived individuals.
“Improved trade activities will help improve the economy of Afghan refugees as well as the local communities in the bordering areas,” Mr Khan said, adding that it was also essential as Pakistan needed to develop healthy and friendly relations with Iran, Afghanistan, China as well as Russia.
He talked about China’s One-Belt-Road Initiative (BRI) which was focused on promoting trade and economic activities among the economies of the region.
“The Chinese government has recently approved a generous fund for infrastructure development under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which is an extended part of BRI,” Mr Khan said, adding that, “therefore the benefit of CPEC has to be shared with the local communities as well as the Afghan refugees.”

4,Call to explore ways to enhance learning through technology,ISLAMABAD: The current education policies at the national and provincial levels have little room for EdTech...,"ISLAMABAD: The current education policies at the national and provincial levels have little room for EdTech (education technology) and there is a need for exploring more pathways of accelerated learning through the use of technology and addressing the issues of financing and costing in different age groups.
This was stated by Bella Raza Jamil, the chief executive officer of Idara Taleem-o-Agahi, while speaking at a seminar on ‘Investigating the impact on learning outcomes through the use of EdTech during Covid-19: evidence from an RCT (randomised-controlled trial) in Punjab’ organised by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), says a press release.
Dean of faculty of education at Allama Iqbal Open University Dr Nasir Mehmood emphasised the need for a forum where research findings on EdTech could be consolidated to prevent the loss of information.
Research director of EdTech Hub Susan Nicolai said technology had the potential to solve the global learning crisis. She said nine out of 10 children in low-income countries were disadvantaged in terms of literacy and numeracy, which had been intensified due to school closures during the Covid pandemic. 
She said the systematic use of technology for educational purposes was limited by schools and students despite its widespread use and expansion in mobile phones.
She added that the EdTech sector was predicted to reach worth $404 billion and the governments of various countries, including Pakistan, had shown keen interest in promoting the sector. She, however, regretted that no structured plans for preferred EdTech technologies had been devised so far.
SDPI research fellow Dr Fareeha Armughan said community perception of technology must be factored in the planning of any EdTech programme.
Referring to a study, she said 90 per cent students had access to television, but only 43pc used it for education as parents’ perception about its utility for educational purposes was negligible. She pointed out that low-income groups surveyed in the Punjab for the research were not well-versed in technology.
SDPI deputy executive director Dr Sajid Amin suggested that in order to promote the educational use of technology, mobile network companies should provide concessional data bundles for various applications widely used for educational content to increase accessibility for low-income students.

6,Experts for national consensus on economic issues,"Stress on importance of promoting trade, strategic ties with regional countries...","ISLAMABAD: Leading economic and energy experts and business leaders have called for a national consensus of all political parties on core issues facing the ailing national economy and called for a roadmap of economic recovery under a comprehensive charter of economy.
Speaking at a seminar on ‘Pakistan: The Next Infrastructure Connector’ organised by the Nutshell Group and Corporate Group Pakistan, economic experts and business leaders were of the view that political leaders should also build consensus on long-term economic policies and promotion of cooperation with regional countries.
Speakers highlighted the importance of promoting trade and strategic ties with regional countries for boosting national and regional economies through the development of infrastructure of roads and rail links, energy corridors and digital connectivity.
Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik said Pakistan could unleash its potential for the geo-strategic location as it would not only be an importer of LNG but an exporter to the landlocked Central Asian states through Gwadar.

Stress on importance of promoting trade, strategic ties with regional countries

He said TAPI and IP gas pipeline were good projects but the regional instability remained a hindrance as “our country has to mitigate our security risk and diversify its energy mix”.
A former national security adviser, Moeed Yusuf, said Pakistan maintained fences with Iran and Afghanistan, therefore movement of trade should be streamlined in a way that the fence should facilitate instead of being a hindrance to regional trade.
“We have to comprehend geo-strategy and geo-economics under the framework of national security because security is inbuilt with the conversation of connectivity,” he said.
Pakistan Stock Exchange Chairperson Dr Shamshad Akhtar said China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and cross-border projects should garner support from multilateral ways which make development easy.
President of Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry Ghias Khan said regional trade was an important driver of the economy but Pakistan’s total trade with the bordering countries stood at nearly $2 billion for various reasons. In order to streamline regional connectivity and trade, he said the government should confine to its role of facilitation, introduce long-term policies and create an enabling environment by removing inefficiencies in the systems.
Former Pakistani ambassador to the US Ali J. Siddiqui suggested that Pakistan could be a major connector with the regional countries, including China, Iran and Afghanistan, through various projects of roads and optical fiber.
Pakistan could improve multilateral ties with the regional countries through small projects of energy, logistics and optical fiber which would pave the way towards sustainability of cooperation, he added.
Circumstances in the region had changed drastically after peace in Afghanistan as a number of countries were talking about the potential of the region, including China and Uzbekistan, he said, adding that regional trade had tremendous potential to grow the economies of the countries hence Pakistan should turn it into opportunities.

We are witnessing the catastrophe that climate change can cause and how it impacts the most vulnerable. My thoughts and prayers are with all the victims and their families and I would like to pay tribute to everyone involved in the relief efforts. We are also working directly with the Pakistan authorities to establish what further assistance and support they require. The UK stands with the people of Pakistan during this time of need,” the statement said.
The United Kingdom also provides assistance to Pakistan through international organisations working directly with the victims of the disaster, including the World Bank and the UN.
