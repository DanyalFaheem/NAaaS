4,Construction on riverbanks not allowed: Mahmood,CM says no federal organisation carried out rescue work in flood-hit province,"SWAT: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan on Saturday said the government won’t allow the construction of houses, hotels and other buildings on the riverbanks in the province.
He was speaking to reporters after visiting the flood-hit areas in a helicopter here along with former federal minister and PTI leader Murad Saeed.
The chief minister conducted an aerial survey of the devastation caused by the deluge in Kalam, Mingora and Matta and met disaster victims.
He said the flash floods had badly hit Tank and Karak districts a month ago but the provincial government immediately took rescue and relief steps and sanctioned emergency funds. “Unfortunately, the loss was higher than expected due to large-scale encroachments on rivers and streams,” he said.

CM says no federal organisation carried out rescue work in flood-hit province

Mr Mahmood said though the district administrations and other relief agencies played a good role in flood-affected areas, the federal government didn’t even ask.
He said it was very sad to note that no federal organisation, including the NDMA, was seen on the ground for rescue activities.
The chief minister said his government was uninterruptedly carrying out relief work across the province.
“The provincial government is using all resources to provide relief to flood victims. The helicopter of the provincial government has been engaged for relief and rescue operations and tourists are being shifted to safer places,” he said.
Mr Mahmood said the current year’s floods in the province caused more devastation than all previous ones but his government was providing all possible relief to their victims.
He said all government machinery was functional in flood-affected areas.
“If we have to use the entire development fund to rehabilitate and resettle flood victims, we will not hesitate to spend it,” he said.
The chief minister said the Swat-Kalam Road was managed by the National Highway Authority but there was no prospect of its early rehabilitation.
“If the federal government does not repair the Swat-Kalam Road in a day or two, I will provide funds for its repair. In this difficult situation, I will be among my people” he said.
Mr Mahmood said he would go all-out to help out flood victims.
He said after rescue and relief operations, a survey would be conducted to assess the damage.
The chief minister said legal action would be taken against those who put up houses, hotels and other building near rivers in the province.

9,Medics call for immediate steps to prevent disease outbreaks,Health dept sets up camps to offer emergency care.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has established camps to provide emergency health relief to people in flood-hit districts amid calls by medics for the provision of clean drinking water, essential medicines and proper shelter to the disaster victims to prevent the outbreak of diseases caused by the use of contaminated water and foods.
Prof Khalid Mahmood, a former physician at the Lady Reading Hospital (LRH) Peshawar, told Dawn that the flood-hit areas were vulnerable to the spread of cholera, typhoid, leptospirosis, hepatitis A and E, malaria, dengue fever and snake bites.
“Lack of access to safe drinking water, improper sanitation, over crowded camps and scarcity of health care services has a compounding effect after floodwater recedes. The flood also affects the food supply chain negatively leading to malnutrition and stunted growth in children,” he said.
According to Prof Mahmood, the natural disasters cannot be prevented but their impacts can be mitigated by ensuring provision of reasonable cover/housing, uninterrupted safe drinking water, nutritious and hygienic food, controlling disease vector like mosquitoes, vaccination and snake-bite prevention measures.

Health dept sets up camps to offer emergency care

CEO of the Health Net Hospital Prof Syed Amjad Taqweem said the people in the calamity-hit areas were at the risk of being bitten by animals and reptiles.
He said evacuation of patients also increased disease burden in addition to loss of health workers, infrastructure and essential drugs and supplies, so immediate steps should be taken to prevent the spread of diseases among vulnerable people.
Prof Amjad said an increase in food and water-borne diseases such as diarrhea, dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid fever, cholera, leptospirosis and hepatitis A and E was common in flood victims.
He said vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, and dengue hemorrhagic fever could be controlled by sheltering them properly tents with availability of clean water, dry food, plastic shoes and other materials to remain intact in water.
The physician called for the setting up of medical camps at places close to the calamity-hit areas besides the patients easy access to them along with air, water and transport.
“Road blockages leading to difficulty in transportation of seriously ill patients to the health facilities and save their lives are other flood-related issues,” he said.
Officials at the directorate-general health services said emergency control rooms had been established at district and provincial level to monitor and take urgent measures.
Meanwhile, the Khyber Teaching Hospital established 20-bed ward and a disaster management committee with director Mohammad Zafar Afridi as its chief to supervise care of patients coming from flood-hit areas.
A news release said weekly offs of staff members had been cancelled to ensure uninterrupted services to patients.
KTH medical director Dr Mohammad Siraj said the hospital had organised medical camps in Nowshera and Charsadda to extend emergency medical relief to the people and refer the seriously-sick ones to the KTH for treatment.
Young Doctors Association leader Dr Aftab Marwat said free health clinics had been established in Nowshera and Charsadda districts, where over 1,000 patients had been examined.
“Our district chapters are holding free medical camps,” he said.
Dr Salim Khan Yousafzai of the Provincial Doctors’ Association (PDA) also reported the establishment of such camps in Swat, Charsadda, Malakand, Nowshera, Dir, Dera Ismail Khan and Chitral districts to prevent disease outbreaks.

11,Lack of facilities in Bara schools mars enrolment campaign,"KHYBER: Official negligence, shortage of teachers and damaged school buildings dealt a serious blow to the ongoing...","KHYBER: Official negligence, shortage of teachers and damaged school buildings dealt a serious blow to the ongoing enrollment drive in militancy-affected Bara tehsil of Khyber tribal district.
Teachers of some government schools, who requested anonymity, told this scribe during a visit to some of the damaged schools in different localities of Bara, that instead of bringing in more students, parents were withdrawing their children from government schools owing to persistent lack of facilities and official negligence.
They said that most of the tents provided by the provincial government about six years ago after destruction of school buildings were worn out beyond repair. They said that students were still compelled to sit under those tents as neither new tents were provided nor were the damaged buildings repaired.
The government provided some schools with fabricated classrooms a few years ago but those could not accommodate the large number of students. The students in some of these schools have to sit in open under trees due to the lack of space inside tents and fabricated classrooms.
Khan Akbar, the principal of Government Middle School Spin Qabar, in Sipah, area told this scribe that he had four fabricated classrooms and only two worn out tents for nearly 1,000 students.
The school was destroyed by militants in 2006-7 and reopened in 2015 after the return of displaced families to Bara. “The school building is in need of immediate reconstruction as students cannot bear the harsh weather conditions,” he said.
About 200 to 300 students were seen sitting in the shadow of the boundary wall as the main compound was muddied with rainwater. Some of water also inundated half space of a tent.
The situation in Government Middle School Gandaw was no different as one of the three tents was recently knocked down by strong winds while over 750 students were ‘stuffed’ into two ruptured tents and four fabricated classrooms.
“I have to adjust students of two or three classes in one fabricated room or tent to continue our courses and keep them busy in their studies,” Abidullah, the principal of the school, said.
Apart from damaged buildings and dilapidated condition of tents, shortage of teachers was also cited to be one of the major reasons for rapid dropout of children of different grades from the government schools in Bara.
Sources said that although schools were reopened in Bara after the return of displaced families in 2014-15 with limited facilities, yet the number of teaching staff was not increased and it remained the same as it was some two decades ago.
Samar Gul, a resident of the area, said that poor parents pulled out their children from government schools for lack of facilities and instead put them to work on daily wages to augment their meagre resources. He said that the parents, who could afford the expenses of private schools, took their children to those institutions.
This scribe tried several times to contact the district education officer (DEO), Uzair Ali, for his comments on the serious setback to the ongoing enrollment drive and continuous official negligence about the provision of better facilities to government schools, but he refused to oblige.
His office had even no figures about the number of so far enrolled children in government schools and the target for this year. The DEO was also yet to inspect the schools in need of repair and provision of other required facilities.

He said the construction activities should be resumed immediately after the flood situation was over. He directed the management to devise a contingency plan in consultation with the consultants and contractor to overcome possible delays in project completion. 
Earlier, the federal secretary and Wapda chairman had a round of various components of the project to have first-hand information about impact of the flood in the project area. 

Wapda chairman calls for contingency plan to avoid delays 

Mohmand Dam project director and senior Wapda officers were also present on the occasion. 
The dam project management made a presentation to the visiting officials about the pre- and post-flood situations. They were told that construction activities were continuing at a good pace on 14 locations of the project prior to the flood. 
They were also briefed about the impact of the flood and loss to different components of the project, especially diversion tunnels, re-regulation pond and periphery roads on both banks of the Swat River in the project area. 
It was stated that this loss and impact could affect timelines of the project’s completion. The two officials were also apprised of the measures taken by the project management to avoid any further damage.

13,Afghan gets life sentence for smuggling drugs,PESHAWAR: A court in Khyber district on Saturday convicted an Afghan national for smuggling narcotics in large...,"PESHAWAR: A court in Khyber district on Saturday convicted an Afghan national for smuggling narcotics in large quantity and awarded life imprisonment and Rs1 million fine to him.
Announcing verdict in the case, district and sessions judge Hidayatullah Khan ruled that the prosecution had proved its charge against the accused, Musa Khan, and the evidence on record connected him with the commission of the offence.
It also ordered the confiscation of the truck, which was used for drug smuggling, in favour of the state.
The convict was arrested by personnel of customs department while driving a truck at the Customs Import Terminal Torkham.
During search of the truck the team had recovered 104kg hashish, 9.13kg heroin and 70kg opium.
An FIR was registered on Dec 19, 2021, against the convict at the police station of the Investigation and Prosecution Branch, Collectorate of Customs (Enforcement), Peshawar, under Section 9-D of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substance Act.
The court declared that the seized narcotics would be ‘kept intact’until the expiry of the period of appeal and they would be disposed of thereafter in accordance with law.
It also took notice of mode of registration of FIRs by the customs officials and observed that as routine the customs seizing officers were used to chalk out reports through computer instead of hand-written.
“It has also been observed that the FIR is scribed through computer on a plain paper and not maintained in the register of FIRs. This practice on the part of customs seizing staff is alien to the established practice,” the court observed, adding that the practice was always subject to criticism for being exposed to foul play and mischief.
It added that in order to ensure transparency and guard the interests of both the parties and avoid miscarriage of justice, it should be ensured by the customs authorities that spot proceedings by the seizing party are written by hand and FIRs are maintained in a proper register with printed serial numbers.
The judge ordered that a copy of the court’s verdict should be sent to the collector customs, Peshawar for compliance.
Special prosecutor Jamroz Khan appeared for the state and contended that the accused was caught red-handed smuggling the contraband from Afghanistan to Pakistan. He said the accused was involved in a heinous crime, so he didn’t deserve any leniency.
