0,Steep fall in profits outflow in July,The FDI in July fell by 43.3pc to $58.9m compared to $103.8m in the same month last year.,"KARACHI: The profits and dividends on foreign investments in Pakistan fell sharply down to an insignificant level in the first month of the current fiscal year, suggesting the poor economic performance.
The State Bank of Pakistan’s latest data showed that the outflow of profits and dividends on foreign investments, mostly foreign direct investment (FDI), in July was just $16.5 million compared to $159.2m in the same month last year.
The July outflow was much less than the June outflows of $50.6m reflecting the slowdown of the economic growth while the inflow of the FDI has also gone down.
The FDI in July fell by 43.3pc to $58.9m compared to $103.8m in the same month last year. 
The situation is highly disappointing for investors since the country is badly hit by flash floods while the inflows of dollars from creditors still remained a dream. 
The economy performed well during FY22 despite a bad spell of political instability in the last quarter.
The repatriation of dollars was even higher than the FDI recorded in FY22. The SBP data showed that the outflows totalled $1.651bn while the FDI was $1.47bn the same year showing a good output of the companies having foreign investments.
While the foreigners were reluctant to invest in Pakistan due to increased risks associated with the declining payment capacity of the country, the IMF’s tough preconditions for the resumption of loan programme remained a new obstacle and kept them alerted. 
The preconditions of IMF will ultimately slow down the economic growth from 6pc to 3pc. 
The data reveals that the highest outflow was from mining and quarrying which was $7.9m in July compared to zero in the same period last year. 
In July 2021, the outflow of profits was $62.5m including $46.6m alone from telecommunication. This year the outflow is zero. 
Food packaging recorded an outflow of $26.8m in July 2021 while this year it’s zero. The outflow from financial businesses (banks) was zero in July FY23 but it was $23.3m in the same month last year.

1,Automakers fear major dent in rural sales  ‘due to floods’,Apma chairman says around 50pc two-wheelers were sold in rural areas.,"KARACHI: After depressed sales in July, auto assemblers paint a gloomy demand scenario in the coming months due to flash floods in various rural parts of the country that have destroyed standing crops and homes of growers.
A sizable volume of motorbikes and four-wheelers are sold in rural areas where small to large growers earn their livelihood through various crops.
Road Prince Motorcycle CEO Sohail Usman said that bike sales of Chinese assemblers have been depressed for the past few months due to high prices and may fall at least 50 per cent of the sale during the same period last year.
He said a large number of buyers in the rural areas would not lift new bikes due to the already rising cost of living, adding that the real impact would be more visible in the next two to three months.
Association of Pakistan Motorcycle Assemblers (APMA) Chairman  Mohammad Sabir Sheikh said around 50pc two-wheelers were sold in rural areas. Floods have reportedly destroyed standing crops of vegetables, cotton, bananas etc. 
Moreover, growers also store wheat for their future consumption and floods have washed away their main staple food.
As soon as the situation improves, the flood-affected people would first procure  food items and resume construction of their houses depending on the government’s aid instead of focusing on purchasing automobiles, which would slow down the overall auto sales in the next two months.
Mr Sheikh said rural buyers would be  reluctant in buying a new bike given the devastation of the road network, which may take months to repair.
According to an analyst briefing held in the last week of May, the share of rural buying in total sales of Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) is 40pc.
PSMCL Head of Public Relations Shafiq Ahmed Shaikh told Dawn that a major portion of sales will be affected due to recent floods. “We are expecting that the government will also consider some relief for the auto sector.”
A Korean car assembler said a disastrous situation has emerged after the floods and there would be a significant impact on sales. He said sowing of all kharif crops would be delayed besides impacting the incomes of growers.
An official in Honda Atlas Cars Ltd said their majority sales are in urban areas.
According to Topline Securities, total car sales including non-members of the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) clocked in at 14,000 units in July, down by 59pc month-on-month and 52pc year-on-year due to production issues, higher prices, the low purchasing power of people and fewer working days due to Eidul Azha holidays.
Overall two- and three-wheeler sales plunged to 96,162 units in July versus 145,197 in the same month in 2021. Honda, Suzuki, and Yamaha sold 80,067, 3,512, and 1,261 units respectively in 1MFY23 compared to 100,002, 2,715, and 1,607 units a year ago.

2,Stocks close in red on tax measures,"The benchmark index closed at 42,592 points, shedding 679 points or 1.57pc on a weekly basis.","KARACHI: The stock market commenced on a negative note in the outgoing week over concerns about new tax measures aimed at increasing revenue collection.
Arif Habib Ltd said the investor sentiment was revived after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the policy rate unchanged. Moreover, the momentum gained further strength after Qatar announced its plans to invest $3 billion in various commercial and investment sectors. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia also pledged an investment of $1bn.
However, the stock market turned negative again after the rupee depreciated against the dollar and closed the week at 220.66 points, down 2.8 per cent on a week-on-week basis.
Reserves held by the SBP fell by $87 million and settled at $7.8bn. With the anticipation of the re-imposition of sales tax on petroleum products, investors’ nervousness with regard to inflation resurfaced.
Hence, the benchmark index closed at 42,592 points, shedding 679 points or 1.57pc on a weekly basis.
Sector-wise, negative contributions came from banking (143 points), miscellaneous (138 points), power (101 points), oil marketing (80 points) and chemical (59 points).
Sectors that contributed positively were fertiliser (70 points) and cement (28 points).
Scrip-wise, negative contributors were Pakistan Services Ltd (137 points), the Hub Power Company Ltd (104 points), Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd (79 points), Habib Bank Ltd (48 points) and TRG Pakistan Ltd (48 points).
Meanwhile, positive contributions came from Lucky Cement Ltd (75 points), Systems Ltd (35 points), Tariq Glass Industries Ltd (26 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd (25 points) and Pakistan Oilfields Ltd (19 points).
Selling by foreign investors continued in the outgoing week and clocked in at $1.9m versus a net sale of $2.8m a week ago. Major selling was witnessed in commercial banks ($3.7m) and exploration and production ($0.7m).
On the local front, buying was reported by banks and development finance institutions ($4.1m) and individuals ($3.8m).
The average daily volume clocked in at 250m shares, down 52pc from a week ago. The average daily value traded settled at $37m, down 35pc on a weekly basis.
According to AKD Securities Ltd, the International Monetary Fund’s loan tranche of $1.2bn will unlock inflows from friendly countries and may lead to positive sentiments in the stock market.
The local currency is also expected to gain a better footing as the fall in foreign exchange reserves will get stopped as a result of the foreign inflows. “The ongoing results season will keep all eyes on the scrips yet to announce results, including heavyweights in the exploration and production sector,” it added.
But sentiments can be affected adversely with the economy slowing down as a result of the SBP’s contractionary policies as well as the floods across the country, it added.

3,Maruti Suzuki open to partnerships to secure supply chain,"“If required somewhere, we will get into a joint venture,” says chairman.","NEW DELHI: Maruti Suzuki is open to forming partnerships with auto part makers to secure its future supply chain and maintain its leadership position, the chairman of India’s top-selling carmaker said in an interview. 
Partnering with suppliers in its early years contributed significantly to Maruti’s success in India, where it has 43 per cent share of the car market, and also helped establish a supply chain for combustion engine cars, R C Bhargava told Reuters.
With growing demand for more technology in cars and a shift to ‘greener’ powertrains like electric and hybrid, automotive supply chains globally are changing and need large investments to keep pace.
“If required somewhere, we will get into a joint venture,” said Bhargava, when asked what role Maruti would play in setting up and securing its future supply chain.
The company, though, is yet to identify specific areas for an alliance, he said.
“We have done it in the past. Maruti built a very strong supply chain because we partnered vendors and have been working with them,” he said, adding that it has about 20 joint ventures with its suppliers.
Majority-owned by Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corporation, Maruti dominates India’s car market with its small, low-cost vehicles. But the company faces growing competition as buyers shift to bigger cars like sports-utility vehicles (SUVs) and regulators demand more safety features, pushing up costs.
Maruti is expanding its portfolio and adding more SUVs but it is behind rivals which has resulted in its market share falling to 43pc from more than 50pc two years ago.
Even so, the potential for small cars in India is huge, said Bhargava. Millions of people still ride motorcycles and scooters because they cannot afford a car despite its better safety profile. Once incomes rise, they will upgrade starting with small, affordable cars, he said.

4,ADB to help govt attract investment in infrastructure,"ADB technical assistance will help govt prepare the project, design, the reform programme, and develop capacity.","ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank will provide technical assistance to Pakistan on a grant basis to support the government’s efforts to create an enabling environment for infrastructure financing and public-private partnership at the federal level.
In doing so, the government hopes to attract private finance for infrastructure investments in priority sectors such as roads, housing, water and sanitation, aviation and technology — all high priorities in the government’s three-year Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
The ADB technical assistance will help the government prepare the project, design, the reform programme, and develop the capacity to implement the promotion of sustainable public-private partnerships programme, according to the project document.
The programme contains actions and initiatives to support reforms in strengthening the legal, regulatory, and institutional environment; strengthening national and sectoral infrastructure planning and project preparation; and strengthening multi-year assessment of fiscal risks.
An ADB document revealed that additional grant financing will also be explored from Asia Pacific Project Preparation Facility (APPF) to support the government in work relating to the development for priority sectors as well as capacity building.
This is expected to include support related to the development of sector strategies for at least two sectors to align public-private partnership projects with the development priorities of the government; capacity-related assistance that is linked to or is complementary to these sectors or projects, including reform that is linked to the policy, legislative, or institutional practices; development of sector-specific draft template documents; and potential transaction advisory services for specified projects.

5,ECB needs ‘significant’ rate hike in September: Villeroy,"French central bank chief says rates should keep rising until ECB hits the neutral level, which is somewhere between 1-2pc.","JACKSON HOLE: The European Central Bank (ECB) needs another significant interest rate hike in September and should hit the  “neutral” level before the end of the year, French central bank chief Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Saturday.
The ECB raised rates by 50 basis points to zero in July to fight inflation that is now approaching double-digit territory and another such move is now fully priced in by financial markets.
Considered a centrist on the bank’s rate-setting Governing Council, Villeroy said that rates should keep rising until the ECB hits the neutral level, which is somewhere between 1 per cent and 2pc. At the neutral rate, the central bank neither stimulates nor holds back growth.
“We could be there before the end of the year, after another significant step in September,” Villeroy told the US Federal Reserve’s Jackson Hole Economic Symposium.
While markets have been betting on a 50 basis point move in September, several ECB policymakers, including Dutch central bank chief Klaas Knot and Austria’s Robert Holzmann, have said that 75 basis points should also be part of the discussion.
Villeroy said the ECB was willing to go higher than the neutral level, if needed.
“Have no doubt that we at the ECB would if needed raise rates further beyond normalisation: bringing inflation back to 2pc is our responsibility; our will and our capacity to deliver on our mandate are unconditional,” he added.
Specific forward guidance, as provided for years, is now viewed as unadvisable given global economic uncertainties.

6,Abbott restarts Similac infant formula production,"BENGALURU: Abbott Laboratories has restarted the production of its Similac infant formula at the plant in Sturgis,...","BENGALURU: Abbott Laboratories has restarted the production of its Similac infant formula at the plant in Sturgis, Michigan at the centre of the US baby formula shortage.
Abbott, the biggest US supplier of baby formula, in February recalled Similac and other infant formula products produced at the Michigan facility after reports of bacterial infections in babies who had consumed products that originated there.
The plant shutdown and subsequent product recall deepened a supply shortage in a nation where less than half of babies are exclusively breast-fed through their first three months, according to federal data from 2020.
To address the serious shortage, US health regulators relaxed import policies and flew in millions of cans of emergency supplies from companies such as Nestle SA and Reckitt Benckiser. Abbott briefly reopened the Michigan plant early last month, but 
had to shutter it again after about two weeks due to damage caused by heavy rains and flooding.
Abbott, in a statement on Friday, said as Similac enters into production, it will take about six weeks for the product to begin shipping to retail locations.
We know that the nationwide infant formula shortage has been difficult for the families we serve, and while restarting Similac production in Michigan is an important milestone, we wont rest until this product is back on shelves, Abbott Chief Executive Robert Ford said in a statement.
In July, the company said it expects to begin releasing EleCare formula from its Sturgis plant after production of it and other specialty formulas restarted last month.
The company also said it would extend rebates offered on competitive products until Oct 31 for participants in the government’s Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program in states where Abbott holds the contract if Similac is unavailable.

7,Energy crisis pushes worldwide return to nuclear power,One of the countries reconsidering nuclear energy is Japan.,"PARIS: As the costs of importing energy soars worldwide and climate crises wreak havoc, interest in nuclear power is on the rise with nations scrambling to find alternative sources.
Investment in nuclear power declined after Japan’s 2011 Fukushima disaster, the world’s worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986, as fears over its safety increased and governments ran scared.
But following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February, the subsequent squeeze on energy supplies and Europe’s push to wean itself off of Russian oil and gas, the tide is now turning back in favour of nuclear.
Governments face difficult decisions with rising gas and electricity bills and scarce resources threatening to cause widespread suffering this winter.
Some experts argue that nuclear power should not be considered an option, but others argue that, in the face of so many crises, it must remain part of the world’s energy mix.
One of the countries reconsidering nuclear energy is Japan, where the 2011 accident led to the suspension of many nuclear reactors over safety fears.
This week Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida called for a push to revive the country’s nuclear power industry, and build new atomic plants.
Other countries that were looking to move away from nuclear have discarded those plans — at least in the short term.
Less than a month after Russia’s attack on Ukraine, Belgium delayed by a decade its plan to scrap nuclear energy in 2025.
While nuclear power, currently used in 32 countries, supplies 10pc of the world’s electricity production, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) raised its projections in September for the first time since the 2011 disaster.
The IAEA now expects installed capacity to double by 2050 under the most favourable scenario.
Climate reasoning 
Even in Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, sticking with nuclear is no longer a taboo subject as the energy crisis rekindles debate on shutting down the country’s last three nuclear power plants by the end of 2022.
Berlin said last month it would await the outcome of a  “stress test” of the national electric grid before deciding whether to stick with the phaseout.
Greenpeace Germany’s climate and energy expert, Gerald Neubauer, said turning to nuclear was  “not a solution to the energy crisis”.
He said nuclear energy would have  “limited” efficacy in replacing Russian gas since it is mainly  “used for heating” in Germany not for electricity production.
“The reactors would only save the gas used for electricity, it would save less than one per cent of the gas consumption,” he added.
But according to Nicolas Berghmans, energy and climate expert at the IDDRI think tank, extending the use of nuclear  “can help”.
“Europe is in a very different energy situation, with several overlapping crises: the problem of Russian gas supply, the drought that has reduced the capacity of dams, the French nuclear plants’ weak output... so all the levers matter,” he said.
The pro-nuclear lobby says it is one of the world’s best options to avoid climate change since it does not directly emit carbon dioxide.
In fact, nuclear energy accounts for a bigger share of the world power mix in most of the scenarios put forward by the IPCC, the UN’s climate experts, to alleviate the global climate crisis.
Divided opinions 
As the need for electricity booms, several countries have expressed a desire to develop nuclear infrastructure including China — which already has the largest number of 
reactors — as well as the Czech Republic, India and Poland since nuclear offers an alternative to coal.
Likewise, Britain, France and the Nether­lands have similar ambitions, and even the United States where President Joe Biden’s investment plan encourages the sector’s development.
The IPCC experts recognise that the deployment of nuclear energy  “can be constrained by societal preferences” since the subject still divides opinion because of the risk of catastrophic accidents and the still unresolved issue of how to dispose of radioactive waste safely.
Some countries, like New Zealand, oppose nuclear, and the issue has also been hotly debated in the European Union over whether it should be listed as a  “green” energy.
Last month, the European Parliament approved a contentious proposal giving a sustainable finance label to investments in gas and nuclear power.
Other issues remain over nuclear infrastructure including the ability to build new reactors with costs and delays tightly controlled.
Berghmans pointed to  “long construction delays”.
“We’re talking about medium-term solutions, which won’t resolve tensions in the market”, as they will arrive too late to address climate crises, he said, but suggested focusing on the  “dynamic” renewable energies sector that can be immediately helpful.
