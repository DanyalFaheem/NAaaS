• FM Bilawal says appeal to complement broader effort
ISLAMABAD: The UN on Tuesday launched a $160 million appeal to provide emergency assistance to those affected by catastrophic floods in Pakistan.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, in a video statement at the launch of the appeal in Islamabad and Geneva, reminded the wor­ld that “Pakistan is awash in suffering” and urged “collective and prioritised attention” to what he descri­bed as a “colossal crisis”.
Secretary General Gute­rres would himself undertake a solidarity visit to Pakistan next week to highlight the scale of devastation caused by the unprecedented floods, and mobilise international assistance.
This year, during the ongoing monsoon season, Pakistan received about 186 per cent higher rainfall than its 30-year national average. Balochistan and Sindh, meanwhile, got over 400pc more rains than the national average.
Mr Guterres described this as “a monsoon on steroids”.
The floods have affected nearly 33 million people, or 15pc of the country’s population. According to the National Disaster Manage­ment Authority, 1,136 people, including more than 386 children, have died since June 14 when the monsoon rains started. Nearly a million houses are damaged, displacing about half a million people to relief camps.
The damage to livelihoods and infrastructure has been enormous with 735,000 livestock perishing and two million acres of cropped area having been destroyed.
The government’s initial estimates suggest that in money terms the losses could be around $10 billion. It is, however, feared the amount could be much higher.
The UN secretary general also used this occasion to emphasise that the disaster was a result of climate change and that the world needed to immediately attend to it.
“Let’s stop sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet by climate change. Today, it’s Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country,” he stressed.
At the launch of the appeal at the Foreign Office, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said the disaster was “of unimaginable scale and magnitude”.
“This appeal is expected to address only a part of the overall requirements and will, therefore, complement the broader effort,” Mr Bhutto-Zardari said, adding the international community’s “full support and solidarity with the people of Pakistan at this time would go a long way in alleviating their suffering and in helping to rebuild their lives and communities”.
The UN Appeal focuses on the needs of 5.2 million people, with life-saving response activities amounting to $160.3m covering food security, assistance for agriculture and livestock, shelter and non-food items, nutrition programmes, primary health services, protection, water and sanitation, women’s health, and education support, as well as shelter for the displaced people.
UN SG visit
Secretary General Guterres will reach Pakistan on Sept 9, UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said in New York. He will visit the areas most impacted by this unprecedented climate catastrophe, and meet with displaced families.
Foreign Office spokesperson Asim Iftikhar welcomed the secretary general’s trip.
“This is going to be significant and will contribute in a big way to our collective effort to highlight the impact of this disaster and to utilize this visit by the UN SG to further mobilize international assistance. We will be looking forward to welcoming the secretary general,” Mr Iftikhar said.

1,Shehbaz wants to work with Imran ‘for crisis sake’,"""Let’s put together a united effort, let’s move with unity of thought and action,"" he says; rules out imports from India.","

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday extended an olive branch to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief Imran Khan, urging him to set aside his acrimony, for now, and work together for providing relief to fellow countrymen affected by unrelenting rains and floods.
Speaking to the international media at the PM House, the premier said he wished to ask Mr Khan to sit with him and move forward on relief efforts and bring the country out of this crisis. “Let’s put together a united effort, let’s move with unity of thought and action, let’s move in unison,” Mr Sharif said in an unprecedented appeal to his predecessor, at a time when both the government and the former ruling PTI are at daggers drawn following Mr Khan’s alleged threats to the police, judiciary and the army and the subsequent cases against him.
Besides this interaction, the PM had a busy Tuesday, as he reached out to several world leaders and expressed his gratitude for extending moral and financial aid to Pakistan to mitigate the sufferings of the flood-hit people
Denying apprehensions that the rescue effort may have got delayed because the media was preoccupied with the wrangling between politicians, Mr Sharif said he had on multiple occasions offered to form a ‘charter of economy’, but was not taken seriously by Mr Khan.
The PM also virtually ruled out the possibility of vegetable imports from India to overcome shortages caused by devastating floods, saying the two sides needed to talk about the human rights situation in India-held Kashmir. He added he was ready to sit with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and talk over the issue.
Mr Sharif, however, said a committee had been constituted to explore the possibility of importing vegetables and other food items, revealing the government was in talks with Russia for import of wheat.
After the meeting, he also tweeted: “If it is us today, it can be somebody else tomorrow. Threat of climate change is real, potent and staring us in the face.”

 





 
PM thanks world leaders
In another tweet, PM Sharif said in line with his commitment, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was leading a humanitarian aid drive for the flood-affected people of Pakistan. “[Six] flights have landed so far; 2 more will arrive tomorrow. Train carrying relief goods left Ankara for Pakistan,” he tweeted.

 





 
He also expressed gratitude to the Chinese leadership and people. “This flood is like no other in terms of its intensity and spread. China has been there for us at the most difficult times & we greatly value its support,” the PM tweeted.

 





 
Earlier, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang expressed solidarity with the government and people of Pakistan over the human and financial loss in the recent floods that have devastated huge parts of Pakistan.
The first batch of relief aid from China containing 300 tents would reach Karachi on Wednesday (today) that the Chinese envoy would hand over to the Pakistani authorities.
PM-IMF: Later, the PM also stressed upon breaking the “economic straitjacket” through structural reforms. “Revival of IMF program, though critical to our economy, is not an end in itself. It offers a pathway to reorient our economy. We will have to work hard to make it self-sufficient. Pakistan must break out of economic straitjacket, which is only possible through structural reforms,” he tweeted.

 





 
PM-EU Council: While talking to PM Sharif over the phone, EU Council President Charles Michel offered his condolences over the loss of precious lives and the material damage as a result of devastating floods in Pakistan.
The PM thanked the EU president and appreciated their support of 2.15 million euros for flood-affected people in Pakistan.
Call to UAE ruler: Later, Mr Sharif also called Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, president of the UAE, and briefed him about the latest flood situation. The PM lauded the work being carried out by the Emirates Red Crescent and Khalifa bin Zayed Foundation in the flood-hit areas. Sheikh Mohamed expressed solidarity with the people of Pakistan and offered all-possible assistance to the affected people.
In another message, the PM thanked the UN for helping Pakistan in this time of need.

2,Indian top court closes contempt case against victors of Ayodhya,"Case closed as SC observes petitioner and chief respondent are dead, rejects plea to substitute petitioner with amicus curiae.","NEW DELHI: The mob that illegally demolished the Babri Masjid against the Supreme Court’s orders was declared the victor in the bitter dispute in 2019, when the apex court awarded the land where the mosque’s rubble lay to the rightwing destroyers, with a piece of the land going to the deity Ram Lala.
On Tuesday, the Supreme Court closed what could be the last of the cases in the Ayodhya dispute hanging for three decades, noting that the petitioner and the chief respondent were dead. It also noted that the core case of the land dispute had already been decided, which the court said made the contempt petition infructuous.
According to the Bar and Bench portal, a bench of Jus­tices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Abhay S. Oka said the petition had become infructuous in light of the top cou­rt’s 2019 judgement in which the Hindu parties were given ownership of the disputed land. The bench also rejected a request to substitute the contempt pet­i­tioner, who had passed away, with the amicus curiae.

The Babri Masjid was dem­olished in December 1992. The same had happe­ned despite an undertaking by the Uttar Pradesh govern­ment to the Supreme Court that the structure would be protected. This had led to the contempt of court case against the UP government. In 2019, the Supreme Court had awarded the disputed site to Hindu nationalists.
In September 2020, a special CBI court in Lucknow had acquitted former deputy prime minister L.K. Advani, former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Kalyan Singh, BJP leaders Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti, and several others in the demolition case. It was held that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) failed to produce any conclusive evidence to prove any connivance that led to the destruction of the mosque. The special court said that there was no documentary evidence to show that there was a conspiracy or provocation to bring down the disputed structure.

3,Imran asks judges to ‘sit out’ contempt case,"In his reply to IHC, PTI chief says he’s ready to ""take back"" his words about judge if they are regarded as inappropriate.","ISLAMABAD: A day before the Islamabad High Court is to take up a contempt case against Imran Khan, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chief pleaded before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday that the judges who had agreed to initiate the case should consider withdrawing themselves from the bench as, according to him, they had pre-judged the matter.
A reply submitted by Mr Khan, through Hamid Khan and Barrister Salman Safdar, recalled a court order passed by the then acting chief justice last week, after receiving a note from the deputy registrar, in which he said the matter was discussed in the tea room and all his colleagues unanimously agreed that “we should proceed forward”.
A five-judge IHC bench, consisting of Chief Justice Athar Minal­lah, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kay­ani, Justice Miangul Hassan Aur­an­gzeb, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri and Justice Babar Sattar, will commence the contempt proceedings against Mr Khan on Wednesday (today). The case pertains to a speech by the PTI chief at a rally in Islamabad on Aug 20 in which he “intimidated” a female judge, Zeba Chaudhry.
The high court issued a show-cause notice to the PTI chairman on Aug 25 with a directive to appear before it in person.

In his reply to IHC, PTI chief says he’s ready to ‘take back’ his words if they are regarded as inappropriate

In the reply, Mr Khan urged the IHC to discharge the show-cause notice and dispose of the contempt matter, saying he believed in the rule of law and an independent justice system. “I do not believe in hurting the feelings of judges.”
Mr Khan also said he was ready to “take back” his words if they are “regarded as inappropriate”, urging the court to examine the content of his speech in the context of his intention, which was ‘bona fide’.
The reply explained that the respondent was under a misconception that Ms Zeba Chaudhry was an executive magistrate carrying out executive or administrative functions on the federal government’s orders.
The government was “bent upon torturing and violating” the fundamental rights of Shahbaz Gill, the PTI chief said about his chief aide.
“It was under this misconception that she was referred to as magistrate,” the reply said, adding the respondent did not mean to threaten the judicial officer or to say anything which brings the administration of law into disrepute.
The reply contended that no contempt was committed by the respondent and that the deputy registrar picked words selectively from his Aug 20 speech during a public meeting at Islamabad’s F-9 Park.
“These words were taken totally out of context and splashed all over the print and electronic media to give an impression as if the respondent (Imran Khan) intended to take the law into his hands.”
The PTI chairman said a mistaken impression was gathered from his speech, which was actually meant to “raise awareness about the rule of law and fundamental rights”, that he intended to belittle the judiciary.
The reply acknowledged that the high court may have initiated the contempt proceedings to allay its concerns about threats facing the subordinate judiciary, but added even these proceedings were being used for “political point-scoring to the federal government’s advantage”.
The reply alleged that while Shahbaz Gill was in the custody of Islamabad police, the federal interior and information ministers continued to “leak video clips to a select group of journalists”.
The PTI chief alleged that the contempt proceedings were initiated on the basis of clippings from those newspapers which were against him.
The reply said the respondent became anxious after watching “visuals of physical torture” and hearing about “sexual abuse” of Shahbaz Gill in police custody.
Jurisdiction
The reply questioned the contempt proceedings against Imran Khan, arguing it was without jurisdiction. Moreover, it contended, a high court cannot invoke any suo motu jurisdiction since it can result in undermining of the rule of law and due process. It said the deputy registrar misinterpreted the law and his own powers since he had no authority under the Islamabad High Court Act 2010 or the Contempt of Court Ordinance 2003.
To protect the rights of all parties and to ensure due process, the law provides a proper course, saying the power to punish for contempt of subordinate courts, vested at present in high courts, can only be exercised after receipt of a reference from a subordinate court.

4,"Gill’s apology, bail plea in sedition case rejected",Eight-page order makes it clear that court’s observations will have ‘no effect on merits’ of the case,"ISLAMABAD: Rejecting the ‘unconditional apology’ and post-arrest bail application of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Shahbaz Gill, a sessions court in its order on Tuesday observed that despite being a responsible person, he made a sensational statement that was enough to disturb the harmony and discipline of the Pakistan Army.
However, the court also made it clear that all the observations in the order on the bail plea were “tentative in nature” and would have “no effect on merits” of the sedition case against Mr Gill.
In an eight-page verdict, which was reserved after the counsel for Mr Gill argued that the city magistrate had accused his client of sedition, a charge that his client had never imagined, Additional Sessions Judge Zafar Iqbal said Mr Gill was a leader of a popular national-level party and he had not made the statement in an indoor meeting.
“His statement was sensational, which was sufficient for disturbing harmony and discipline in the most respected institution of Pakistan i.e. the Pakistan Army,” the order said, mentioning that the accused was a highly qualified and responsible person who gave his statement on the national media.

Eight-page order makes it clear that court’s observations will have ‘no effect on merits’ of the case

The court, in its order, observed that during investigation of the case, he was charged with 12 offences, but the relevant offence in this case attracted Section 131 (abetting mutiny or attempting to seduce a soldier from his duty) of the Pakistan Penal Code. The judge stated: “Keeping in view the opinion/statement of the accused peculiar circumstances ..., prima facie, the accused has, at least, committed the offence under Section 131 of PPC, which falls within prohibitory clause of Section 497 Criminal Procedure Code (that prohibits bail for offences punishable by death) and no codal formality under Section 196 CrPC (prosecution for offences against the State) is required for lodging of FIR for the offence.”
The order explained that that opinion expressed by the accused was not in the public interest and integrity of the country. “The law does not provide that an accused will become invariably entitled to grant of bail in every case,” it noted.
It was an admitted fact, the order said, the accused gave an interview on the fateful night to ARY News channel and that its transcript, the contents of which was also not denied, was available on record.
Advocate Burhan Moazzam Malik, the principal counsel for Mr Gill, earlier at the hearing tendered “unconditional apology” on behalf of his client if anyone’s feeling was hurt regarding his bonafide statement. He explained that Mr Gill was a PhD professor who had been awarded a number of awards by varsities in the United States, and was a “patriotic, peaceful and law-abiding citizen who came to Pakistan to serve the nation”. Therefore, the counsel said, he could not even imagine persuading the masses to break the law through mutiny or sedition.
Special Prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi, however, reminded the court that since the petitioner had not questioned the transcript of the statement made on the electronic media or claimed it to be forged and fabricated, he had in other words “admitted the contents of the transcript”.
Also, he said, the complainant in the case against Mr Gill did not pick or choose regarding his statement on the national media rather he had only “highlighted the objectionable contents” at the time of lodging of the FIR against the PTI leader.
Ghulam Murtaza Chandiyo, the city magistrate of Islamabad, had got registered the FIR against Mr Gill on Aug 9 a day after the latter made a controversial statement on ARY News channel.

5,"LHC judge ‘bars’ Iesco from collecting FPA, lawyer claims","Says judge's ""verbal order"" provides relief to all consumers, not just those who avail less than 200 units.","ISLAMABAD: Lahore High Court (LHC) Justice Jawad Hassan has “verbally” barred the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco) from collecting the fuel price adjustment (FPA) charges as the court aimed to provide relief to millions of consumers across northern Punjab, claimed advocate Rizwan Elahi, who had petitioned the high court against the fuel charges.
A number of people across Pakistan had resorted to protests against the federal government over its approval of the massive increase in power charges which led to inflated power bills in August for both domestic and industrial power consumers. Subsequently, the government of PM Shehbaz Sharif exempted households using less than 200 units from the FPA.
Advocate Elahi, who petitioned the Rawalpindi bench of the high court against the inflated bills, told Dawn that the court “removed the ambiguity” surrounding the bills and after the “verbal order” all consumers — not just those who availed less than 200 units — were eligible for relief.
Iesco supplies power to areas comprising Jhelum, Chakwal, Gujjar Khan, Rawal­pindi, Islamabad, Attock, and parts of Azad Kashmir.
Asked about the copy of the court order, he said the judge gave the “verbal orders” and added that a detailed order will be issued later.
In an earlier video message, the petitioner claimed that Iesco had been told by the court to issue revised bills within two days. He added that those who had already paid their bills would be compensated in the next month’s bills.
“The order has also been sent to Nepra (National Electric Power Regulatory Authority) and Iesco; therefore, the adjustment will automatically be passed on to the consumers in the next bills,” he claimed.
In an identical petition, filed by the owner of a private housing scheme, the same court observed that “interim relief has already been granted in the aforesaid (identical) writ petition; therefore, following the rule of consistency, it is directed that the petitioner shall pay the outstanding amount of electricity bill(s) for the month of August 2022 within due date except the FPA mentioned therein, for which, the respondents concerned shall issue revised bills within next two working days.”
On Aug 25, Minister for Power Khurram Dastgir announced an exemption from FPA for those consuming up to 200 units, claiming benefit to 17 million users at a cost of Rs22 billion to the national exchequer.
Last month, Nepra allowed distribution com­panies to charge an additional Rs155bn to compensate for the higher fuel generation cost in June. The authority allowed an unpre­cedented FPA of Rs11.37 to K-Electric and Rs9.89 per unit to electricity distribution co­m­panies previously owned by Wapda, or Discos.
The government had also announced an increase of Rs7.91 per unit in the average base tariff across the country in three phases starting with effect from July. It had approved a Rs1.55 per unit increase in the base tariff across the country under a quarterly adjustment.

6,"Govt to allow onion, tomato imports from Iran, Afghanistan","FBR asked to waive taxes, levies on onion and tomato imports for next three months.","

ISLAMABAD: The food ministry would issue permits within 24 hours to facilitate onion and tomato imports from Iran and Afghanistan, the government decided on Tuesday as it tries to stabilise food prices.
The decision was made in a meeting held in Islamabad on Tuesday. The food ministry has asked the Federal Board of Revenue to waive taxes and levies on onion and tomato imports for the next three months and expects that this will be made effective immediately.
The measures aimed to ensure the supply of essential commodities in the market and stabilise prices, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research said in a statement.
Calamitous monsoon floods have sent food prices skyrocketing, putting many staples out of the reach of the poor. Onions and tomatoes have been affected the most.

PTI lashes out at govt for trying to resume trade with India ‘on pretext of floods’

Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said earlier this week the price of onions had shot up by more than five times, and that the government was trying to quickly implement policies to stabilise food prices — including importing from India.
Read: How trade with India may prove ‘cost-effective’
The food ministry said it had taken all stakeholders on board to ensure a smooth supply of essential commodities and had directed the Department of Plant Protection to remove barriers for importers.
During the meeting, it was observed that imports from Iran and Afghanistan would have minimal impact on the foreign exchange reserves because of special trade arrangements with these countries.
The participants agreed that the country would face a shortage of tomatoes and onions over the next three months, as recent floods have badly damaged crops.
A contact group has also been created, where imp­orters will be able to share their problems. Bes­ides, a team of the food ministry will monitor the situation and take necessary action for redressal.
Pakistan’s embassies in Iran, Afghanistan, the United Arab Emirates and other countries have also been requested to assist imports.
Meanwhile, an assessment report of the ministry estimates that the onion crop in Sindh was partially damaged. Some 42,268 acres under onion cultivation were affected, leading to a financial loss of Rs10.14 billion and yield losses of 120 maunds (around 4,500kg) per acre on average.
Besides, the Sindh Agriculture Department estimates that 12,101 acres of tomato crop have been damaged due to heavy rains and the resultant floods. The damaged area is about 20pc of the total cultivation area, and the financial loss has been estimated at a little over Rs2.7bn.
Meanwhile, the agriculture department of Balochistan is seeking Rs30.9bn in compensation for the losses and damages and subsidising affected farmers in the coming sowing season.
It said Rs19.8bn was needed for compensation and Rs11.07bn for the subsidy on account of fertiliser sand Zaid, kharif and rabi seasonal crops like pulses, sorghum, wheat and oilseeds.
The commerce ministry is also in contact with foreign governments to make the arrangements as soon as possible through commercial counsellors and trade attaches.
PTI slams govt on ‘trade with India’
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lashed out at the government on Tuesday for allegedly trying to resume trade with India on the pretext of floods.
In a Twitter post, party leader Fawad Chaudhry wondered how the government could start trade with India ignoring the atrocities on the people of occupied Kashmir.
He said Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s steps were not only against Muslims but also against humankind and trade could not be started unless such policies were reversed.
“We will oppose such decisions and never allow trade on the pretext of floods. The government should not betray the blood of the people of Kashmir,” he said.
