1,Balochistan cut off after floods damage bridges,"Gas, electricity supply still disrupted; COAS visits flood-hit areas of KP, links devastation to structures on Swat river.","QUETTA / SWAT: Hund­reds of people were stran­ded on Quetta-Sukkur N-65 Highway after two vital bridges were closed due to damage to their structure.
Up north, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa, who visited the flood-hit areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Swat district on Tuesday, blamed constructions along river banks for the devastation caused by floods.
The Bibi Nani bridge in Kacchi area of Balochistan has been damaged due to incessant downpour and flooding in the area. Meanwhile, Pinjra Bridge on the highway has been washed away.
As bridges were closed, passengers, including women, children and elderly people were struck between Ab-i-Gum and Dhadar area of Bolan district.

Gas, electricity supply still disrupted in province; COAS links flood devastation to structures on Swat river

“We are sitting in the buses and facing a very difficult situation as food and water is running out,” said Ghulam Muhammad, 60, who was travelling on the road.
A driver Muhammad Afzal said that they can neither reach their destination nor go back to Quetta.
However, PDMA officials have said that the passengers were being provided with cooked food and water. Meanwhile, local administration and NGOs were also providing the supplies.
Commander 12 Corps Lt-Gen Asif Ghafoor has also visited the bridges and directed National Highway Authority officials to finish repair works and restore traffic within 24 hours.
Gas, electricity supply still disrupted
Even after passage of several days, gas and electricity supply to different areas of the province could not be restored.
Meanwhile, internet and mobile phone service were still facing disruption in provincial capital Quetta, which was still disconnected from other parts of the country through the road and railway network.
Authorities have said that efforts to restore the services were being hampered by overflowing seasonal rivers and nullahs which were still carrying floodwater.
The pipeline in Bolan river, which was swept away last week, could not be repaired as the river was still carrying high flood.
“We have dispatched machinery, pipelines and other equipment and after security clearance and soil testing, repair work will be launched,” said Sui Southern Gas Company spokesman Salman Ahmed Siddique.
The internet and mobile services were suspended once again after the optic fibre cable was damaged in Bolan area.
“We are trying to repair the damaged cable and restore services in Quetta and other areas,” a PTCL spokesman said.
COAS blames illegal constructions
Meanwhile, the COAS has said that it was the negligence of the authorities to allow construction on the banks of Swat river after the catastrophic 2010 floods.
Talking to the media after his visit to Swat, the COAS said legal action must be taken against those who allowed constructions on the river’s banks.
During the visit, the COAS also met locals and tourists rescued by army aviation helicopters from Kumrat and Kalam.
Gen Bajwa said the army would always stand with the people in difficult times and do its best for relief and rescue.
Talking about relief operations, the COAS said other nations have been contra­c­ted for provision of tents as Sindh and Balo­chistan are in dire need.
He also lauded the resp­o­nse from overseas Pakistanis and said they were sending generous donations to help their countrymen.

2,More than half million pregnant women among flood-hit in dire need of care: UNFPA,UNHCR asks world to step up support for flood victims.,"ISLAMABAD: The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), a sexual and reproductive health agency, has painted a bleak picture of women affected by the unprecedented floods as it said that at least 650,000 pregnant women, of whom 73,000 are expected to deliver next month, in the flood-affected areas are in dire need of maternal health service.
The UN agency also warned that many women and girls were at an incre­a­­sed risk of gender-based violence (GBV) as almost one million hou­ses were dama­g­­ed in the floods that spelled suff­ering for millions across Pakistan.
“Up to 73,000 women expected to deliver next month will need skilled birth attendants, newborn care, and support,” the agency said, adding that pregnancies and childbirth cannot wait for emergencies or natural disasters to be over as this is when a woman and baby are vulnerable and need the most care.
“UNFPA is on the ground, working with partners, to ensure that pregnant women and new mothers continue re­­ceiving life-saving services even under the most challenging conditions,” ac­­ting UNFPA Pakistan Repre­sen­tative Dr Bakhtior Kadirov said.

UNHCR asks world to step up support for flood victims

According to the UN agency, over 1,000 health facilities were either partially or fully damaged in Sindh, whereas 198 health facilities were damaged in the affected districts in Balochistan. The damage to roads and bridges also compromised girls’ and women’s access to health facilities, it added.
“We will continue supporting health facilities with the equipment and human resources to be fully operational despite the challenging humanitarian conditions,” said Dr Kadirov.
In a bid to ramp up its emerge­n­­cy response, the UNFPA Pakis­tan procured 8,311 dignity kits, 7,411 newborn baby kits, and 6,412 clean delivery kits for immediate delivery to Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, and Punjab.
Editorial: Looming shortages
The UN agency said it was also prioritising gender-based violen­­ce prevention and response serv­i­­­ces, including medical and psychosocial support to the survivors of GBV.
UNHCR appeals for more help
As the UNHCR has delivered relief items in the worst-hit areas of Balo­ch­is­tan and Khyber Pakhtun­kh­­wa, UN High Com­mis­sio­ner for Refugees Filippo Grandi asked the international community to step up its support and help Pakistan’s response to the catastrophe.
“Rain and floods have been catastrophic for millions of people. We urgently need global support and solidarity for Pakistan in these dire times,’’ said Filippo Grandi.
Over 30 million people in Pak­istan have been affected by torr­ential rains and flash floods ac­­ross the country, leaving 6.4 million people in need of immediate support. Since June, hundreds of thousands have been displaced by the floods, and are now living in camps, or with host families.
So far, UNHCR has provided refugee villages, as well as host communities, with more than 71,000 eme­rgency relief items, including tents, plastic tarpauli­­ns, sanitary products, cooking sto­­ves, blankets, solar lamps, and sleeping mats.
In addition, UNHCR delivered 10,000 sacks to help households build up defences around their homes. “This assistance to date amounts to over $1.5 million, but much more aid is needed,” its press release said.

3,Call to legislate limits for state institutions over disappearances,"PPP Senator Farhatullah Babar suggests that ""enforced disappearances must be treated as a separate, autonomous crime"".","ISLAMABAD: An event held to mark the International Day of Enforced Disappearances on Tuesday rang out with calls to introduce legislation to ensure that limits were imposed on state institutions, and former lawmakers and activists demanded that laws that lay down boundaries for the functioning of intelligence agencies should be introduced.
A large number of human rights activists, politicians and lawyers gathered outside the office of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) to demand that the state must act against those involved in enforced disappearances.
Former PPP senator Farhatullah Babar said a new legal architecture was needed to tackle the problem of enforced disappearances, and bringing the intelligence apparatus under the ambit of the law should be its central pillar.
He said that security agencies should provide guarantees that those deprived of liberty are kept at an authorised place of detention; and that victims, their families and witnesses should be provided protection and compensation.

Farhatullah Babar terms formation of Ministerial Subcommittee ‘step in right direct

He lamented that while laws prohibiting illegal abduction and detention exist, under which thousands of FIRs have already been registered, there is no progress on them since the actors involved seem to be ‘above the law’.
He recalled how, in Dec 2015, the Senate Committee of the Whole made nearly half a dozen proposals for legislation on the role of security and intelligence agencies, adding that rules the government should have either implemented the recommendations or reverted back to the Senate with reasons of why it could not implement them.
“The Commission on Enforced Disappearances has also failed miserably. In not one case has it been able to prosecute a perpetrator of the crime. The commission should be disbanded and a new one set up.
Mr Babar said that an inadequate Bill was moved in the National Assembly in June 2021 to address the issue, but even that bill seems to have disappeared.
“The setting up of a Ministerial Subcommittee by the present government on the issue is a step in the right direction,” Mr Babar said, adding that he expected the subcommittee to propose comprehensive legislation in consultation with all stakeholders. “Enforced disappearances must be treated as a separate, autonomous crime,” he suggested.
Speaking on the occasion, HRCP Coordinator for Islamabad region Nasreen Azhar said there was credible evidence to suggest that state institutions were involved in the practice of enforced disappearances. She recalled that such crimes began to surface in the 1990s, but became widespread after 9/11.
Defence of Human Rights’ Amina Masood Janjua said that enforced disappearances were a grave crime, which must be taken very seriously.
“The involvement of certain powerful state institutions in this practice has been established, but unfortunately, the state has failed to hold them accountable for their unlawful actions. The Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances has also miserably failed to achieve its objective,” she said.
Human Rights Advocate Imaan Mazari Hazir briefed the participants about the incidents of enforced disappearances of Baloch students and ongoing efforts for their safe recovery.

4,Floodwaters threaten vestiges of Sindh’s past,"Iconic sites such as Moenjo Daro, Kot Diji, Ranikot suffer widespread damage; trust official laments govt inaction.","KARACHI: The Mound of the Dead, one of Moenjo Daro’s most iconic features, is covered in blue tarpaulin. The torrential rains that have left most of Sindh inundated have not spared these ruins either, and workers scramble to reinforce the retaining wall of the mound as water seeps down into the unexcavated parts of the site, carving channels as it goes.
While the government and welfare organisations battle to provide relief and rehabilitate the hundreds of thousands left homeless by the savage monsoon downpours, heritage and archaeological sites across the province are also in dire need of repair.
Reports emanating from various parts of the province paint a pretty bleak picture; the very forts, tombs and autaqs etc which symbolise the glorious past of the region are now in danger of crumbling.
At Moenjo Daro alone, the rains have damaged excavated areas and exposed the ones buried underneath by creating furrows in them. The accumulated water has seeped into the excavated areas, loosening the soil and resultantly tilting the walls. This site, among the primary surviving bastions of the Indus Valley civilization as it dates back to 2,500BC, is one of the last remaining connections Pakistan has with prehistory.

Iconic sites such as Moenjo Daro, Kot Diji, Ranikot suffer widespread damage; trust official laments govt inaction

In Larkana, which saw some of the heaviest downpours in the region, the Shah Baharo and Tajjar buildings are covered in rainwater overflowing from drainage and sewage lines in the city centre. But it is the Mian Noor Mohammad Kalhoro graveyard (in Moro) that has, arguably, suffered the most. Here, several graves, including six tombs, have completely vanished and the condition of many others has deteriorated severely. The walls of those that do stand have caved in.
Apart from that, the Buddhist stupa at Thul Mir Rukan has fallen victim to the inclement weather as its drum has been broken. The floods have not spared the famous Makli monuments in Thatta and Banbhore either — both internationally renowned archeological sites.
Talking about the seriousness of the issue, Hamid Akhund, who is secretary of the Endowment Fund Trust (EFT) for the Preservation of Heritage of Sindh, told Dawn on Tuesday that the damage is “on a massive scale”.
“Whatever we have restored has been damaged. There is not a single place left in Sindh where heritage remains intact; be it Kot Diji, Ranikot, Shahi Mahal, White Palace, Faiz Mahal, the historic imam bargahs, bungalows or public dispensaries.”
According to Mr Akhund, Kot Diji — often considered the strongest of the ancient fortifications in the region — has all but collapsed, as have the walls of Ranikot.
“We do not know what is happening in Thar. There is four to five feet of stagnant water in Kot Diji. The entire heritage area of the province is turning into Moenjo Daro, and the government is not moved,” he said.
Mr Akhund lamented that while the provincial Culture Department spends mammoth amounts on a variety of events, but not a single delegation has visited these sites, so far.
He suggested that rather than organising musical programmes, those funds should be diverted to save Sindh’s heritage and its monuments.

5,ECP restrained from deciding contempt case against Imran,Commission allows PTI counsel to submit party leaders’ response by Sept 7.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday sought time to submit its response to the notice of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and informed a four-member bench of the commission about the high court orders restraining it from taking a final decision on the contempt proceedings against the party chairman and two leaders.
Appearing before the bench, PTI lawyer Ali Bukhari also claimed he had “learned of the [ECP] notice only orally”, and requested time to submit the power of attorney to plead the case. He said that he was “unsure why the notice was served” and sought time to submit a response.
Upon this, the commission adjourned the hearing of contempt proceedings against Imran Khan, Asad Umar and Fawad Chaudhry till September 7.
The ECP was also informed that the Rawalpindi bench of Lahore High Court (LHC) on a petition of Mr Fawad also passed an order to restrain the commission from taking a decision in the matter, a day after the Sindh High Court (SHC) had issued a similar order on Mr Umar’s petition.

Commission allows PTI counsel to submit party leaders’ response by Sept 7

According to the ECP spokesperson, notices were issued to Mr Khan and two other PTI leaders for using ‘intemperate, unparliamentary language’ against the electoral body and Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja.
In the notices issued after the electoral body reviewed the speeches of the three leaders, the ECP asked them to explain their position with regard to their ‘contemptuous’ remarks.
Earlier on Tuesday, the Rawalpindi bench of the LHC restrained the ECP from taking action against Mr Fawad on his plea against the notice.
Appearing before Justice Jawad Hassan, Advocate Faisal Farid, the counsel for Mr Fawad, argued that the ECP was not a court and therefore was not protected by the “contempt of court provisions” under the Constitution.
While restraining it from issuing a final order on the contempt matter, the court issued a notice to the ECP seeking its response on September 7.

6,Trucks carrying relief items looted in Dera Murad Jamali,Several NGOs providing relief goods in Balochistan stop operations after the incident.,"DERA MURAD JAMALI: Several NGOs who were providing relief goods in Balochistan’s flood-hit areas have stopped operations after trucks carrying relief goods were looted in Dera Murad Jamali.
Officials claimed that hundreds of people, including women, who were affected by floods gathered near the Tehsildar office after receiving information about the arrival of trucks.
After intercepting two trucks, they took away ration and other relief items, sources said.
Later, police and local administration officials reached the spot to control the situation.
The NGOs have sought security from law enforcement agencies while also demanding actions against the looters.
Meanwhile, there were reports about protests in Dera Bugti, Kohlu and other areas over non-provision of relief goods.
The protesters alleged that goods were reaching the affected areas, but the administration has been dumping them in government godowns and distributing on the basis of political affiliations.
However, government officials have denied the allegation and said that some elements were exploiting the situation and creating propaganda.
They said the Provincial Disaster Management Authority and many NGOs were involved in equitable distribution of relief goods including cooked food, drinking water and tents.

8,PTI to take ‘unprecedented’ decisions if voted into power again,Imran admits to making blunders after coming to power in 2018.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan on Tuesday admitted to have made blunders after coming to power in 2018, but vowed to take steps which have never been taken before to get the economy out of the crisis if his party gets another chance to rule the country.
Mr Khan said three-and-a-half years of his government were very challenging as the then opposition parties had been attempting to topple his government from day one and cause political instability in the country, but he learnt a lot about the economy during his first term.
The ex-premier expressed these views at an event titled, Seminar on The Economy in Freefall, during which PTI secretary general Asad Umar, KP Finance Minister Taimur Jhagra, ex-finance minister Shaukat Tarin, economist Saqib Shirani, PTI leaders Jamshed Iqbal Cheema and Omar Ayub shed light on the deteriorating economic situation, its causes and possible solution.
Mr Khan said if his party came to power again, he will have better knowledge about economic challenges and their solutions, as he has decided to form an ‘economic team’ to assess them beforehand.
“Our government would take important decisions which had never been taken in the past,” he pledged, while highlighting the need to think out of the box to bring the country out of crises.
Nobody took decisions for a prosperous future of the nation, Mr Khan deplored, explaining that there was need to take ‘tough decisions’. “There had never been long-term planning to lift economy, to conserve water or to protect the environment,” he reasoned.
Censuring the coalition government at Centre, the PTI chairman said it devastated Pakistan’s economy.
He said the challenges were big and warranted ‘bigger steps’ to stablise the economy.
He said those sending remittances were a ‘great asset’ of the country, as neither the IMF nor friendly countries but the expats would bail the country out of crisis. “Overseas Pakistanis had supported me for Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital. But nowadays, financial assistance from expats was being called ‘foreign funding’,” he remarked. The Election Commission of Pakistan must have seen ‘foreign funding’ during the August 29 live telethon, he jibed.
Also in a tweet, Mr Khan said: “I want to thank the people of Pakistan, especially our overseas Pakistanis, for donating so generously last night. In the three hours of our telethon we had pledges of Rs5 billion.”

 





 
In another tweet, the ex-premier condemned alleged torture on Haleem Adil Sheikh.
