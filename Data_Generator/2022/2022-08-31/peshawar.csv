2,PHC stops centre from withdrawing Rs50 million Peshawar development funding,Seeks federal govt’s reply to PTI MNA’s plea on matter.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday issued a stay order temporarily stopping the federal government from withdrawing around Rs50 million funding for development schemes in a Peshawar National Assembly constituency.
A bench consisting of Justice Roohul Amin Khan and Justice Shahid Khan issued notices to the secretaries of the cabinet and planning and development divisions seeking their response to a petition of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MNA Arbab Amir Ayub from Peshawar city against the “federal government’s decision to remit funds meant for development of his constituency under the Sustainable Achievement Programme Funds (SAP) to the Pak-PWD.”
The petitioner challenged the July 26 decision of the federal government’s Steering Committee on Sustainable Development Goals to approve the recommendations of its sub-committee for the return of the unutilised SAP to the Pak-PWD for its distribution to other development schemes.
He requested the court to declare those recommendations and their approval ‘illegal and based on ulterior motives’.

Seeks federal govt’s reply to PTI MNA’s plea on matter

Advocate Khalid Rehman appeared for the petitioner and said that his client was elected MNA from the NA-28 Peshawar constituency.
He said that under the PM Imran Khan-led last PTI government in the centre, the steering committee on SDGs had allocated funds for various developmental schemes in various districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of the SAP Funds.
The lawyer said that Rs478.61 million funds were earmarked for the purpose.
“For development schemes in the NA-28 constituency, Rs350 million was appropriated and initially, Rs300 million funding was released,” he said, adding that as the codal formalities were fulfilled, tenders were formally invited through newspapers.
Mr Rehman said that the Chamkani tehsil municipal administration, the executing agency, issued a public notice to invite bids for the development schemes, while work orders were issued to successful bidders on May 30, 2022.
He said that the deputy commissioner of Peshawar district, being the chairman of the district development committee, requested the deputy director of the Sustainable Development Unit at the provincial planning and development department through a letter on June 13, 2022, to release the requisite remaining funds amounting to Rs49.60 million for executing the remaining development schemes.
The counsel said that after the ouster of the PTI government in the centre, its successor changed its earlier decision ‘out of pure mala fide’ and the federal government’s steering committee assigned the task of revision of the earlier decisions.
He added that the sub-committee made various recommendations regarding the SAP Funds and the steering committing approved those recommendations.
Mr Rehman claimed that it was decided to return the SAP funds to the Pak-PWD for its distribution and release to other schemes rather than utilise the same on already assigned ones.
He argued that once the developmental work on the said schemes was initiated after proper approval of the competent forum and most of the work had already been completed, so withholding of the funds didn’t have any justification and was unlawful.

6,"Illegal riverside structures built before PTI tenure, claims CM",Mahmood says Rs1bn released for rehabilitation of flood-hit areas.,"CHARSADDA: Chief Minister Mahmood Khan said here on Tuesday that most of the illegal structures along the riverbanks were built before formation of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government in the province.
He said that the recent flood caused heavy losses in Tank, Dera Ismail Khan and Swat owing to encroachments near rivers and waterways. He said that most of the illegal structures were set up before formation of PTI government.
He said that his government launched a massive anti-encroachment drive across the province and banned construction on riverbanks and natural waterways.
The chief minister visited Charsadda and Nowshera to inspect the relief activities and damage caused by the flood. 

Mahmood says Rs1bn released for rehabilitation of flood-hit areas

He also met with the flood victims residing at relief camps.
He said that repatriation of displaced people was the first priority of the government. He added that repatriation of displaced people would be started after receding of the floodwater.
He directed the quarters concerned to immediately arrange generators at the relief camps to provide uninterrupted power supply to the flood victims. 
He said that all available resources were being utilised as part of the rehabilitation efforts. “An amount of Rs1 billion has already been released and summary for the provision of additional Rs2.5 billion has also been approved by the provincial cabinet,” said Mahmood Khan.

8,Court moved over posting of AC ‘suspended’ for torturing lawyer,PHC bar seeks departmental inquiry against the officer...,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court Bar Association on Tuesday challenged in the high court the appointment of an assistant commissioner, who was ‘suspended’ during a controversy between the legal fraternity and administrative officers over two months ago.
A petition was filed by PHCBA through its secretary general Farooq Afridi, requesting the high court to set aside the notification of July 22 to the extent of appointment of AC Aftab Ahmad in Tanghi tehsil, Charsadda.
It has also prayed the court to direct Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary and secretary of establishment department to initiate departmental proceedings against him under the Efficiency and Disciplinary Rules.
The petitioner also sought the court’s directives to police for conducting fair investigation in the FIR registered on June 4 against the AC by a senior lawyer, Syed Ghufranullah Shah, who accused him of criminal intimidation and torturing him at a filling station in Peshawar.

PHC bar seeks departmental inquiry against the officer

The FIR against the AC was registered at Chamkani police station on June 4 on the order of the additional sessions judge, who accepted a petition of the lawyer under section 22-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
The AC was at centre of a controversy between lawyers and civil servants after Ghufranullah Shah was arrested at a filling station and an FIR was registered against him on his order on June 2. He was at that time serving as additional assistant commissioner in Peshawar.
The controversy resulted into protests by both the sides as the lawyers observed strike for 12 days whereas the civil servants observed symbolic strike across the province by wearing black armbands.
Both the parties ended their protests on June 14, claiming that their major demands were accepted by the government.
The petition filed by PHCBA president Rehmanullah Khan stated that the government had issued a suspension order of the AC on June 14 but no departmental inquiry was initiated against him.
The petitioner stated that it was shocking for them that the chief secretary issued the impugned notification regarding postings and transfers of government servants wherein AC Aftab Ahmad was also posted in Tanghi tehsil of Charsadda.
The petitioner has questioned whether the suspension order of the respondent of June 14 was bogus and fake. He questioned whether in the absence of any restoration order of the respondent, the impugned notification to the extent of his appointment was legal.
The petitioner contended that government was duty bound under the KP Civil servants (Efficiency and Disciplinary) Rules 2011 to initiate departmental inquiry against the said officer.
It is worth mentioning that the said lawyer was accused by the AC of stopping him from performing his duty at a filling station on June 2.
In the FIR against the lawyer, the AAC insisted that he went to a filling station on GT Road to look into the complaints about ‘hindrance to fuel supply to motorists’ and as he was busy with his official duty, Ghufranullah, who was also present there, began hurling threats at him and his police guards before attacking them and trying to snatch their weapons.
