0,Two PTI lawmakers booked for obstructing Haleem Adil Sheikh’s arrest,"SHO alleges MNA Fahim Ahmed Khan, MPA Raja Azhar attacked him and others when they arrested Haleem.","KARACHI: Police on Tuesday registered a case against two Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmakers and around 25-30 party workers on charges of resisting arrest of Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh on Monday.
MNA Fahim Ahmed Khan, MPA Raja Azhar were booked in a case registered on the complaint of SHO Mohammed Zubair who stated that he along with other policemen was present inside prison for security duty where the opposition leader was presented before an antiterrorism court by the Anti-Encroachment Force (AEF).
He said after the suspect was granted bail, AEF official Sohail Akhter and others arrested the opposition leader in another case. 
As the AEF attempted to shift him to their police station, the PTI legislators and 25-30 workers allegedly attacked him and others creating hindrances in performance of an official duty, blocked road and resorted to hooliganism, he added.
Sheikh sent to prison
Also on Tuesday, a judicial magistrate remanded Mr Sheikh in judicial custody in the second case pertaining to alleged land grabbing.
On Tuesday, the investigating officer produced the PTI leader before Judicial Magistrate (Malir) Furqan Karim to seek his 14-day physical remand in the custody of the AEF for interrogation.
During the hearing, Mr Sheikh complained of maltreatment in the custody, saying he had not been given meal for the last two days.
He added that prison authorities had also failed to provide him medical treatment for an injury in his leg despite clear directives issued by the ATC judge on the last date.
His counsel Malik Altaf Hussain opposed the IO’s request for physical remand and pleaded the court to remand him in judicial custody.
After hearing arguments, the magistrate sent the PTI leader to prison and directed the IO submit an investigation report within two weeks.
A case under Section 8(1) of the Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010, was registered at the East Anti-Encroachment police station on the complaint of Mukhtiarkar Zulfiqar Ali Mangi on Aug 29.

1,"Flood victims feel neglected by govt, looked after by NGOs at camps in Karachi",A displaced person says he had not seen any govt official since he arrived in Karachi from Qambar.,"KARACHI: There are ralli, the colourful appliqué work Sindhi quilts, drying over the boundary walls. Inside the verandah grilles are being used to dry children’s clothing items. There are also clothes lines tied from grille to grille and pillar to pillar that are full of big cotton shalwars and shirts drying out in the open. The government schools and colleges being used as relief camps for flood victims of Sindh are providing roof over the heads of many shelter-less families.  
The big banners on the building gates say that these are government camps, but other than the banners there seems to be no other presence of government personnel there, not even police or Rangers.  
The people are being cared for by different non-governmental organisations and political parties. There is Saylani Welfare Trust providing them with food and medicines. There is also Dawat-i-Islami distributing warm meals.  
The children run around playing tag and other fun little games. Some are keeping themselves amused by clicking the electric light and fan switches on and off. Some women are sitting huddled together; others sit side-by-side as they watch. Inside, there are more than four to five families sprawled in each classroom.  

A displaced person says he had not seen any govt official since he arrived in Karachi from Qambar

Everyone has their own painful story of leaving their district or village.  
Government Girls Secondary School Sachal Goth is housing some 750 to 800 people affected by floods.  
Jazib Ali from Mehrabpur in Naushahro Feroze told Dawn that his area was under 12 foot water. “My goats have drowned. My newly-built cottage has collapsed, my cotton crop spread over four acres of land is destroyed,” he said.  
Khaliq Zaman, also from the same area, said that his stored wheat was all gone. Mauj Ali, another fellow villager, was mourning his buffaloes.  
Bibi Hakim Zadi said that she along with her family arrived with just the clothes on their backs. “We are just eating and staying here to stay alive but our entire life we have left behind in our village,” she said sadly.  
There were also some people not very happy with the arrangements in the school buildings.  
Mukhtiar Ali Chandio from Qambar Shahdadkot said that he was staying in one of the government school buildings in Karachi with some 200 more people from his area. “I have not seen any government official in the four days that I have been here along with my family and neighbours. There are certain party volunteers though,” he said pointing to the young turbaned volunteers from Dawat-i-Islami’s Faizan Global Relief Foundation (FGRF).  
“They bring us warm food, which we cannot digest. It is too spicy and it makes our children sick. We want to go back but we can’t. So it would be helpful if they provide us with rations, oil and tea instead of biryani so that we can cook our own food,” he added.  
Suddenly it started drizzling; the children playing in the school courtyard broke off pieces of cardboard from the empty relief goods cartons lying on one side and covered their head and shoulders with them as they went back to their fun and games.  
“Children are innocent. They keep themselves occupied with in all circumstances,” said Rubina, a young widow with three little children. “My husband died in the first rains in June. Now we are here and I don’t know what is to become of us. My children are also suffering from malaria fever,” she said as she headed towards a stall set up by the Saylani Welfare Trust to distribute medicines.  
‘Hard to please’ 
Another mother of six complained that she only got a water cooler, a bucket and a mat here. But when a volunteer overheard her complaining to the media and confronted her, she smiled and said: “I’m happy with whatever you have provided me. Thank you.”  
Another person affected by the floods said that he wanted money so he could rebuild his house that collapsed in the rains.  
“We have been doing all that we can for these people here,” said Dawood Jan, a young FGRF volunteer. “And still they complain that they are not looked after properly.”  
Ramiz Bhutto, another volunteer, said that they had been providing them breakfast, lunches and dinners, but the people want more.  
“We are trying our best to help them. Other than the meals, we are also providing milk, Cerelac, diapers, but they are unhappy. Obviously, they are depressed. They are not even pleased to see the gifts people donate for them,” he sighed.  
Umair Hassan, assistant operation manager at the Saylani medicines camp said that they also provided meals to the people.  
“We bring them naan, qeema and chicken, too, which goes unappreciated,” he shrugs.  
Some local city folk, who speak Sindhi, also try to get inside the school building for free meals but the guard turns them away.  
At another camp set up in a school in Gulshan-i-Iqbal’s Madhu Goth, which is under construction and has a broken wall, it is not possible to keep the locals out. But the Saylani volunteers there don’t seem to mind their presence.  
“We won’t turn away anyone who is hungry,” Nadeem Shah, a Saylani volunteer, told Dawn. “At least they appreciate us more than the people affected by the flood taking refuge here,” he smiled.  
Upon which, Abdul Razzak from a village in Larkana stepped in to explain. “Look, you may mean well but your spicy food is intolerable for our stomachs. We cannot digest your tandoori naan, too. There is this very kind polio worker Seema Baji who comes here with donated clothes from us as well. But she only brings jeans, pants and shirts. We don’t wear such clothing. We wear shalwar kameez only,” he pointed out, adding that there were 260 of them taking refuge in the school who were settled here by the district deputy commissioner’s office.  
“Other than that there has been no contribution from the government,” volunteer Shah cut in.

2,"Ex-MPA who filed plea against ban on Altaf picked up, SHC told","Former MQM MPA filed a plea before SHC last week, stating that ban on Altaf was in violation of provisions of Constitution.","KARACHI: A lawyer on Tuesday informed the Sindh High Court that his client, a former lawmaker of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, was taken into custody for filing a petition seeking removal of a ban on media coverage of party founder Altaf Husain.
Former MQM MPA Nisar Ahmed Panhwar had last week filed the petition before the SHC stating that the ban on Mr Hussain was imposed in violation of several provisions of the Constitution and pleaded to lift the same.
When the matter came up for hearing on Tuesday, a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh questioned the maintainability of the petition.
The chief justice asked about the written order regarding the ban and inquired whether the petitioner got any authority letter to move court on behalf of any other person. 
The bench also inquired about the absence of Mr Panhwar. Upon which, his lawyer Khalid Mumtaz replied that his client was picked up last night and the court might take a suo motu notice against his detention.
While asking him about the provision that allowed a high court to take a suo motu notice, the bench directed the petitioner’s lawyer to satisfy it about the maintainability of the petition on the next hearing to be fixed by its office later.
Citing the federal interior, information and law secretaries and the Pakistan Media Regulatory Authority as respondents, the petitioner in his petition contended that the ban on media coverage of MQM founder was made in violation of Articles 4, 17, 19 and 25 of the Constitution.
He stated that Mr Hussain had never violated any provision of law, but due to misinterpretation of his speeches, a ban was imposed against him, which was not sustainable.
The MQM founder time and again apologised politically from all quarters concerned in respect of any misunderstanding and misinterpretation of his speeches and therefore, he was entitled to take part in political activities, it maintained.
The petition further stated that Mr Hussain had not been convicted on the ground of hate speech in the UK as well as in Pakistan and sought directive for respondents to remove the ban.

3,Residents take to streets against prolonged loadshedding in city,Road from Gizri to Boat Basin remained clogged with traffic for hours due to protest at KE head office...,"KARACHI: Thousands of commuters remained stuck in traffic jams in parts of the city as infuriated consumers of the K-Electric took to the streets against prolonged loadshedding and overbilling.
Gizri Road leading to Boat Basin remained clogged with bumper-to-bumper vehicles when a large number of protesters gathered near the KE Head Office and chanted slogans against the power utility for resorting to up to 12 hours of loadshedding.
Reports suggested that several protests against the frequent loadshedding by the KE were held with consumers demanding the power utility to immediately end the ongoing prolonged loadshedding in almost every part of the city during day and night-time
The protesters said that the loadshedding, which had made their lives miserable, was being carried out regardless of exempted and unexpemted areas.

Road from Gizri to Boat Basin remained clogged with traffic for hours due to protest at KE head office

They added that they were having sleepless nights as frequent power outages had become routine during night-time.
People also alleged that the power utility was punishing the people with more outages in the areas where protests were being held against the prolonged loadshedding.
Traffic remained congested for hours on the Gizri Road piling miseries on people, including students and women.
Eyewitnesses said that residents of the surrounding areas, including Delhi Colony, gathered at Punjab Chowrangi and protested against the frequent and prolonged power disruption and overbilling, badly affecting the flow of traffic for several hours.
The protesters, who included a large number of women and children as well, said that on one hand, the electricity remained off for hours, and on the other, power utility was billing excessively.
They said that menace of power outages had also badly affected the lives of students.
A woman protester, resident of Punjab Colony, said that her school-going children were not able to complete even their homework due to prolonged loadshedding.
“We just don’t know when the power supply will be disrupted, and a lot of my domestic chores are affected due to unannounced loadshedding,” she lamented.
Long queues of vehicles were formed from Punjab Chowrangi to Boat Basin causing traffic congestion in many parts of Defence Housing Authority and Clifton.
Later, a heavy contingent of police, along with senior police officers, reached the spot and persuaded the protesters to disperse. The traffic flow was restored after hours-long negotiations with the protesters.
Another protest was reported in Amrohi Colony, a locality in Orangi Town. People remained on the streets for some time and dispersed peacefully after chanting slogans against the power utility.
Meanwhile, a KE spokesman said that the utility had taken legal action against protesters and as many as 10 FIRs had been lodged since Aug 12 with different police stations. He said police had arrested four suspects.

4,Police seek massive ‘vehicle-wise’ increase in traffic fines,"If accepted, driving wrong way will cost motorcyclists Rs2,000, car and truck drivers Rs3,000 and Rs5,000 compared to current...","KARACHI: The Karachi traffic police have decided to revise its challan policy and introduce “vehicle-wise traffic fines” to deter people from violating traffic laws as violators are ‘flagrantly’ continuing to disobey rules without any fear of law since present fines are too small, it emerged on Tuesday.  
DIG-Traffic Ahmed Nawaz Cheema proposed in a letter to authorities concerned for the upward revision of traffic violation fines and put forward a “vehicle-wise traffic fines” system.  
The Sindh police chief has already endorsed the proposal and his office sent it to the provincial home department, from where it will be sent to transport and mass transit department. As per procedure, the provincial assembly have to amend the motor vehicle law to make the upward revision official. 
According to the DIG’s letter, a copy of which is provided to Dawn, on average, 3.57 million violators had been booked each year (2019 to 2021) under the existing Motor Vehicles Laws. “Despite a huge number of tickets issued, people indulge in reckless driving causing Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) and more than 500 precious lives lost each year in RTAs on the roads of Karachi alone.”  

If accepted, driving wrong way will cost motorcyclists Rs2,000, car and truck drivers Rs3,000 and Rs5,000 compared to current uniform Rs500 fine

In the proposal, the vehicle-wise existing traffic fine of provinces of Punjab, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has also been attached to draw difference between the fines imposed in the provinces.  
The document showed that for the violation of traffic signals, motorcycles were fined Rs200, Rs300 and Rs200 in Punjab, Balochsitan and KP. Whereas, cars and jeeps are supposed to pay Rs500 in Punjab, Rs400 in Balochistan and Rs1,000 in KP. 
Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) and Light Transport Vehicles (LTVs) are fined with Rs1,000 in Punjab, Rs500 in Balochistan and Rs1,000 in KP for violation, and Heavy Transport Vehicles (HTVs) have to pay Rs1,000, Rs500 and Rs1,000 in Punjab, Balochsitan and KP for jumping signal.  
However, in Sindh, all vehicles are fined Rs400 for violating traffic signals. 
Revision of fines
Fines of Rs500, Rs1,000, Rs1,500 and Rs2,000 have been proposed for motorcycle, car/jeep, PSV/LTV and HTV for the subject violation.  
A total of 52 violations, including exceeding speed limit, prohibited overtaking, obstructing movement of emergency vehicles, driving at night without proper lights, wrong side, tinted/covered glass, wrong way, obstructing traffic, riding without helmet, reckless driving, driving without licence, refusal to produce licence, juvenile driving, repeating the violation and not stopping when required by traffic police, have been mentioned for the revision of their fines and their vehicle-wise categorisation.
For exceeding prescribed speed limit, motorcycle has been proposed to be fined Rs700, car/jeep Rs1,000, PSV/LTV Rs1,500 and HTV Rs2,000, which, right now, is Rs400 irrespective of the vehicle.  
Rs2,000 fine for motorcycle, Rs3,000 for car/jeep, Rs4,000 for PSV/LTV and Rs5,000 for HTV has been proposed for driving on wrong side. The fine for the violation these days is Rs500.  
If found with tinted glass, the vehicle owners are fined with Rs1,000 currently, but it has been proposed to increase that to Rs1,200 for car/jeep, Rs1,500 for PSV/LTV and Rs2,000 for HTV.  
The fine for riding bike without wearing safety helmet has been proposed to be increased up to Rs500.  
Fine for driving without licence is proposed to be increased to Rs1,000 for motorcycle, Rs1,500 for car/jeep, Rs2,000 for PSV/LTV and Rs2,500 for HTV from the current Rs500.  
Speaking to Dawn, DIG Cheema said that this model had been implemented in the rest of the provinces, but Sindh is yet to adopt it.  
He said that this would help curb the traffic rules violation, which consequently would help maintain the traffic discipline on the roads of the city.

5,"SHC issues notices to KE, Nepra on JI plea against loadshedding, overbilling","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday issued notices to the ministry of power, National Electric Power Regulatory...","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday issued notices to the ministry of power, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and K-Electric (KE) on a petition of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) against prolonged loadshedding and overbilling especially in the name of fuel adjustment charges (FAC).
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi also put the Sindh advocate general on notice for Sept 9.
It ordered to serve notices to the respondents through all modes apart from publication, and to put the power secretary and Nepra chairman on notice through the Islamabad district judge as well.
The lawyer for the petitioner assured the bench that he would place on record the order passed in a writ petition by the Lahore High Court exempting the amount of FAC mentioned in the power bills of the petitioners till the next hearing.
Karachi JI chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman along with two other party leaders petitioned the SHC stating that the KE and other respondents had failed to discharge their obligations for uninterrupted supply of electricity to the citizens.
Petitioners’ counsel Usman Farooq argued that the extended loadshedding in the city was due to poor performance of the KE.
He further submitted that during a number of proceedings, the apex court and the SHC had restrained the KE from loadshedding, but the power utility arbitrarily decided on loadshedding just for its financial gain and deliberately closed down its generating units operated by diesel and furnace oil whereas it was still charging the customers the cost of the power generated from diesel and furnace oil.
The lawyer contended that the loadshedding had become out of control in summer and monsoon seasons. Even when the weather had become much better after rains, the KE was still carrying out extended loadshedding several times in night and day, which made the lives of the citizens miserable, he added.
He argued that Nepra had no mechanism to gauge the actual production of power by the KE and demand of electricity for the provincial metropolis.
The lawyer further submitted that the ministry was providing extraordinary support to the KE in the shape of huge finance on account of subsidiary electricity from the national grid as well as fixed gas quota just to help the power utility minimise the cost of electricity, but the benefit was not being passed on to the consumers.
He argued that the KE was extorting a huge amount of money from its consumers in the name of FAC with the permission of Nepra and added that they had approached the regulatory authority, but to no avail.
They also asked the SHC to restrain the KE from carrying out loadshedding, especially in night-time, and to direct the power utility to generate power as per the required demand and in accordance with the agreements made with the federal authorities.
They also sought directive for Nepra to stop the KE from overbilling in different names, including FAC and sales tax, TV licence fee and income tax.
The petitioners said the KE might be directed to improve its system and replace the old machinery in order to improve its performance in generation, distribution and transmission of electricity.

The fresh estimates and assessments from the health authorities engaged in relief work suggest that a huge number of people, including women and children, are suffering from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, cholera, fever, flu, allergy, scabies and other fungal skin ailments.  
“We observe that due to an absence of any guideline, a huge quantity of unwanted medicines are being donated which go into waste or are misused in the name of flood victims. So with the assistance of the Pakistan Society of Health-System Pharmacists we have devised a guideline that gives awareness in this regard.” 
He shared details of several medicines including anti-infectives (oral), cough and cold preps, pain/colic and fever management (oral) drugs and medicines used during pregnancy/ female care, antacids, wound dressings, vomiting/nausea (oral) drugs, antidiarrheals (oral) and other medicines used as basic first aid supplies.  
The health authorities, he said, are also coordinating with local pharmaceutical firms and welfare organisations to help them reach the affected areas in dire need of medical supplies.

7,KU teachers warn of classes’ boycott over delay in promotions,"KARACHI: Expressing grave concern over a long delay in promotions, Karachi University (KU) teachers have demanded...","KARACHI: Expressing grave concern over a long delay in promotions, Karachi University (KU) teachers have demanded that the university administration immediately announce a schedule for holding selection boards according to the procedure clearly defined in the University Code and the 2018 Act.
Speaking at a press conference, organised by KU Selection Board Action Committee, here on the campus on Tuesday, Dr Riaz Ahmed said that the continued delay in promotions had led to deep frustration and de-motivation and the teachers plan to observe hunger strikes and boycott classes, if this matter further lingered on.
Several teachers waiting for their promotions, he pointed out, had retired, while more than 400 faculty members were waiting for their selection boards since 2019. There were also some pending selection boards of 2013.
Dr Ahmed regretted that the university administration had taken no notice of grievances of teachers who had been holding protests over the issue for two months now.
Presenting demands on behalf of the newly formed action committee, Dr Ahmed said the administration announced a schedule for the posts advertised in 2019.
“Taking consent of foreign experts for engaging them in the scrutiny process has become a major reason for delay in promotions. This is so because the university hasn’t been able to adopt modern methods of sending candidates’ documents for foreign scrutiny and make timely payments to experts,” he explained.
This scrutiny process, speakers said, neither existed at any Pakistani university (where promotion process was completed in a few months) nor was in line with the Sindh Universities and Institutes Laws (Amendment) Act 2018. It was adopted in old times when relevant subject experts were not available within the country.
The 2018 act, teachers shared, adopted the same promotion procedure as given in the University Code of 1972, which required that three experts should be part of the selection board.
At KU, there are currently 136 vacant posts for lecturer, 45 for assistant professors, 37 for associate professors and 110 vacant posts for professors. Resultantly, several departments are being run without chairpersons. The total number of internal and external candidates who applied for these posts in response to the 2019 advertisement are between 5,000 and 6,000.

8,"Friends, family remember singer Nayyara Noor",KARACHI: Emotional scenes were witnessed on Monday evening when members of the family and close friends of singer...,"KARACHI: Emotional scenes were witnessed on Monday evening when members of the family and close friends of singer Nayyara Noor, who passed away on Aug 20, came together to share their memories of her at an event held at the Arts Council of Pakistan to pay tribute to her.
Nayyara’s husband and actor Shehryar Zaidi said he, like a few other speakers, was finding it difficult to speak about his late wife.
He said: “Everybody knows that she was a great singer, but she and I spent 49 years together, she was a friend of mine. When I worked for PIA and often stayed late for work on overtime, I used to resist it because I wanted to reach home as soon as possible. Our [the couple’s] taste in music was also very similar. We knew all the songs from the 1930s up until the 1990s. She was a loving wife. Only a few know that she was a good mimic as well. I learned a lot of things from her. The most important thing that I learned from her was self-respect.
“In those 49 years, I never ate a cold roti. No matter what time I would return to home from work, she would make fresh rotis for me. She was a fine cook. She had tremendous respect for beggars and faqirs, never let any mendicant go empty-handed. Also, she would never let her weakness known to others because she had faith in God. She helped people out without letting them feel needy. Another quality in her was that she would never get impressed by power or money. Nayyara always spoke the truth. She never compromised on her principles. The media mentions some of the facts about her wrong, for example, her date of birth is Dec 25 not the one that social media has come up with,” he said.
Nayyara’s son Naad-e-Ali said the other day [Sunday] was a Pakistan-versus-India cricket match. Before that, the last time the match took place, the watchman of the neighbourhood where they live rang their doorbell to say that a loud noise was coming out of their house. It was because during those matches they used to get super excited and Nayyara would be part of it. “Sunday’s match was incomplete.”
He said after burying his mother when he stepped away a bit from the graveyard, no friend who came to extend their condolences to him used the word ‘aunty’; all of them addressed her as ammi or amma. “She was everyone’s mother. She loved everyone.”
President of the Arts Council Ahmed Shah said it was an honour for the council that Nayyara was a member of its governing body for many years. Oftentimes they would ask her to preside over our meetings. During the recent vaccination drive he requested her to resume singing. She came up with reasons not to do so.
Salima Hashmi went down memory lane when in the 1970s in Lahore they did a TV show Sach Gup created by Shoaib Hashmi in which Arshad Mahmud and Shahid Toosi composed songs for Nayyara to sing. She also remembered Farooq Qaiser on the occasion. She added that “Nayyara’s persona needed to be redesigned” [for TV].
In between the speeches, a video was shown which warmed the hearts of the audience because it had snippets from Nayyara’s life including bits of some of her memorable songs.
Sultan Arshad, Karamat Ali and Munawwar Saeed also spoke. Music composer Arshad Mahmud moderated the event.

The demand was made at a meeting of the Joint Action Committee, an umbrella organisation of different human rights and civil society organisations. 
Chaired by Karamat Ali, the meeting analysed the flood situation and its repercussions. Representatives of the organisations updated about their official responses and presented their suggestions and opinions.
“The government itself should utilise its resources, especially the overall non-development budget should be cut by 50pc, such that the extra benefits should be abolished and this money should be spent on the welfare of the affected people,” said a statement issued after the meeting.
The meeting also called for removal of all restrictions imposed on international and domestic organisations to facilitate relief work.

The district administration had sounded an alert on Monday evening warning people of the three towns that deluges triggered by breaches in FP and Suprio protective bunds and MNV (Main Nara Velley) drain might pose a serious threat to their lives. It had advised the people to move to safe places as soon as possible.
The Kolachi Mori section of the highway had come under several feet high water blocking the way for hundreds of trucks, mini-trucks, vans, tractor-driven trolleys, motorcycles and other vehicles carrying marooned families to relief camps of their relatives living in safe areas.
While the land communication between Dadu city and Mehar town had already been cut off, the latter has now disconnected from other towns of the district as well as it has been surrounded by floodwater. 

Many vehicles stranded as floodwater cuts off Indus Highway at many places

According to reports received here late Tuesday evening, the deluge had reached two kilometres from Mehar town after inundating farmlands all around it.
Most of the migrants were destined for Dadu, Hyderabad or Karachi.
Focal person for relief and rain emergency at Dadu Fayyaz Butt said hectic efforts were being made to raise a “ring bund” to protect Mehar. He hoped that the efforts would meet success before arrival of the deluge.
It was stated that 80pc of the 200,000 residents of Mehar had vacated the town.
While water gushing out of breached FP bund from Faridabad town flowing directly towards Mehar and reached 10kms away at Bachao bund, deluges from breaches in Suprio bund at Gozo-Khan Jo Goth section were aggravating the situation. 
The last protective bund of Khuda Wah, some half kilometre in Khairpur Nathan Shah, is under immense pressure, officials said.
Dadu Deputy Commissioner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah said that Khairpur Nathan Shah faced a major threat of heavy flooding and that was why people were asked to leave the town.
Pakistan Army, Navy and Rangers using boats, helicopters and other means of transport have rescued and moved to safe places over 1,000 people and were continuing their operations in the areas.
The land communication between Dadu and Johi was also cut off by floodwater at Gadehi village.
Many youths were seen arriving at the MVN drain by swimming in floodwater. They urged the rescuers to arrange boats to bring their families maroon in several villages located in the nearby Johi taluka areas.

13,"Sindh govt failed to provide relief to rain-hit people, say PTI leaders",THATTA: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPA Khurram Sherzaman and the party’s Sindh president Ali Zaidi have held Sindh...,"THATTA: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPA Khurram Sherzaman and the party’s Sindh president Ali Zaidi have held Sindh government responsible for the predicament the flood-hit population is in after rains as the departments concerned have completely failed to provide relief to poor masses.
They said during a visit of flood-affected areas in Thatta and Sujawal districts where they also inspected flow of water from historical Dulah Dariya Khan bridge on the Indus River on Tuesday that people had no more expectations from rulers. They told media persons that the Sindh government had not taken concrete measures to provide relief to people.  
Sherzaman said that neither the provincial government nor the federal government was capable of coping with the worsening situation and claimed the governments were not even able to assess the actual scale of devastation caused by flooding and downpour.
“Karachi is the heart of Sindh and we are here to help our calamity-stricken brethern. Where are the feudal lords now,” said Ali Zaidi, adding that PTI would form government in the province in 2023. He said in answer to a question about PTI’s political strategy that they never had any lust for power and despite all kinds of conspiracies PTI would return to power again.  Hitting out at the federal government, he said that ARY channel had been a robust voice of people which the present government had suppressed, proving that their claims of upholding democratic norms were bogus. 
“PTI will work for the freedom of speech in the country,” he vowed and added that the media persons who had to leave the country to escape victimisation would come back after PTI’s return to power. 
Sherzaman said that more floodwater was likely to enter the barrages of Sindh in the coming days but the 
provincial government was incapacitated to cope with the situation. 
The condition of flood-affected families in Sujawal and Thatta was pitiful, he said. 
The two leaders also met flood-affected families during their visit and assured them of their complete support.
