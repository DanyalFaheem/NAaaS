0,Curriculum for minority students finally approved,Sources say govt will have to  35 books for classes one to five and 21 books for classes six to eight.,"ISLAMABAD: The education ministry on Tuesday finally approved the much-delayed curriculum for students who belonged to minority communities.
“Today, a detailed meeting was held in the ministry on the issue of curriculum for minority students and finally it was decided to approve the curriculum. The notification in this regard will be issued on Wednesday,” said Additional Secretary Education Waseem Ajmal.
According to sources, during the meeting, Education Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain said the issue should have been decided earlier and that the notification be issued on Wednesday by all means.
It is relevant to note here that the Ministry of Education notified National Curriculum for classes six to eight some months ago and subsequently students started the new academic session this August with new books, however, the ministry did not notify the curriculum for minority students.
In the absence of a notified curriculum, students belonging to seven minority communities – Christian, Hindu, Sikh, Kalash, Bahai, Buddhist and Parsi - have been pursuing their education without their religious books.
The National Curriculum Council (NCC) had sent a summary to the Ministry of Education for notifying new curriculum for minority students from classes one to eight in May this year, however, the summary could not get approval from the ministry officials till Tuesday as some officers wanted Ethics to be continued in schools for these students instead of a new curriculum. However, common sense prevailed in the meeting with all officers approving the said curriculum prepared by the NCC.
The said curriculum was prepared by NCC after getting detailed input from all seven communities, who with consensus, agreed on the draft curriculum.
Sources said the government will have to publish 35 books (one book each for seven religious minorities) for classes one to five and 21 books for classes six to eight, based on enrolled number of students.
They said that technically the curriculum for minorities from class one to five should have been notified last year, when the education ministry notified the new curriculum for Muslim students.
This year, the ministry notified new curriculum for class six to eight and based on that, from this academic session, which started on Aug 1, new books were introduced in schools.
“All is well that ends well. We are very happy. This is big day for us as the ministry has approved curriculum for minority students,” said an officer of the education ministry.

1,CDA looks to SC after developer seeks new terms,AGP office says proposal to hand over commercial land instead of money better outcome for civic body...,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has asked the BNP Group – a private construction firm – to approach the Supreme Court after the latter approached the civic body for “settlement of pending litigation” and offered to transfer a piece of commercial land to settle the issue.
The BNP project, One Constitutional Avenue, was de-sealed in 2021 after almost five years following a judgement by a three-member SC bench headed by then chief justice Saqib Nisar. 
In line with the 2019 verdict, the developer deposited Rs1.7 billion in the CDA account which was the first instalment of the total Rs17.5 billion settlement. 
The building was sealed and lease of the plot was also cancelled, as the plot was meant for the construction of a hotel but the developer had built and sold residential apartments instead.
However, now instead of making the pending payments, the developer floated a proposal in August this year wherein it offered the CDA a commercial piece of land valued at Rs9.6 billion to settle the issue once and for all.

AGP office says proposal to hand over commercial land instead of money better outcome for civic body

Due to current economic conditions, “it has become impossible for us to complete the project and also make the annual installment of Rs2.92 billion,” the developer said in a letter to the CDA. 
The present value of the balance amount of Rs14.583 billion, according to the developer, comes to Rs9.46 billion following a 15.57pc KIBOR discount as per term and reference of the lease agreement.
“The CDA will become the exclusive owner of the said commercial property in lieu of the balance “discounted” lease amount payable and will be at the liberty to use, rent or sell the commercial area,” the developer added in its letter to the civic body.
After receiving the letter, the sources said the member estate decided to approach the attorney general for an opinion. In its response, the attorney general office said both the CDA and developer were bound by the top court ruling. 
Secretary Khalid Khan Niazi said the proposal of the developer appeared to be a lawful and reasonable way to conclusively settle all outstanding litigation.
The secretary stated: “The benefit to CDA from the implementation of the proposal is a better outcome for CDA than if BNP were to be successful in its review, which is a possibility given the lack of reasoning in support of the SC order and given the admitted inability of the 
CDA to find a solution to the problem of the third parties, in whose favour rights have been created.”
In case the CDA “decides to accept the proposal, then the civic body and BNP will have to make a joint application in the SC” along with the BNP praying for the litigation to be disposed of.
After the said opinion, Member Estate Naveed Ilahi, through a letter on Aug 16, asked the developer to approach the top court “for disposal of the subject case as per the proposals submitted to this office for settlement of pending litigation”.

2,"Treason case sought against Imran, three others","Chairman of Aman Taraqi Party, Mohammad Faiq Shah, has filed an application with Islamabad police.","ISLAMABAD: An application has been filed with Islamabad police to register a treason case against PTI Chairman Imran Khan, former finance minister Shaukat Tarin and incumbent finance ministers of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Mohsin Khan Leghari and Taimur Khan Jhagra.
On Monday, two audio clips surfaced via TV channels and social media in which a man said to be Mr Tarin can be heard guiding the two provincial ministers to tell the federal government and the IMF that they would not be able to commit to a provincial budget surplus in light of the recent floods that have wreaked havoc in Pakistan.
The audios triggered criticism against PTI and the ruling collation alleged that it was nothing but a conspiracy to derail the government’s deal with the IMF.
The application, available with Dawn, has been submitted by the founder and chairman of Aman Taraqi Party, Mohammad Faiq Shah, who is a resident of E-7, to the the Kohsar police station.
The complainant stated that on Aug 29 at 11:50pm he saw a tweet of journalist Hamid Mir in which two audios were shared. In these audios, Mr Tarin was directing Mohsin Leghari and Taimur Khan Jhagra to create hurdles in the IMF deal.
“Mr Tarin was clearly saying that the way the government had lodged cases of terrorism against PTI, there was a need to increase pressure on it by creating hurdles in the IMF deal. It was also said that the decision was made after consultation with Imran Khan,” he said.
He said Mr Tarin had confessed to it during a programme Kal Takby Javed Chaudhry that it was the narrative of the party which showed that the PTI was trying to hatch a conspiracy against Pakistan.
The complainant said Imran Khan had already stated that Pakistan will default just like Sri Lanka. He alleged that such conspiracies were being hatched on the directions of foreign powers and it was a treason.
The complainant requested the police to take legal action against all the four suspects.

4,INGOs barred from carrying out relief operations in flood-hit areas,UN official calls for exemption of NOC conditions.,"ISLAMABAD: After spending $7.5 million and reaching out to 777,667 people to provide a humanitarian response, international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have been facing restrictions in carrying out relief activities in affected districts.
While Pakistan has asked the United Nations to launch a global appeal to cope with devastating floods, the authorities are still not giving permission to INGOs already operating in Pakistan.
Talking to journalists, Pakistan Humanitarian Forum (PHF) Country CoordinatorSyed Shahid Kazmi said INGOs performed a great role in the 2005 earthquake and 2010 floods.
“This time the disaster is quite huge, a number of INGOs are not present in the country. There is a need to look at policies which hamper and delay the working of INGOs,” he said, adding that, “it is a known fact that Pakistan was among the top list of those countries which are highly vulnerable to climate change, and to deal with the current humanitarian crisis in a better way, the federal and provincial governments must facilitate INGOs.”

UN official calls for exemption of NOC conditions

He said the authorities for the time being should exempt no-objection certificate (NOC) conditions for INGOs and local NGOs and allow them to operate in disaster-hit areas of Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as the practice was adopted during Covid-19 to provide immediate response.
“In addition, a quick registration process is required for new INGOs in Pakistan to provide humanitarian response at a faster pace to the needy,” Mr Kazmi added. The Pakistan Humanitarian Forum (PHF) is a representative body of 38 INGOs duly registered with the interior ministry and working in Pakistan for various humanitarian and development initiatives.
The latest official figures highlight that a total of 33 million people have been affected by the recent floods and unusual weather patterns, and around 6.4 million people were in dire need of basic essentials that include food, shelter and so on.
Floods have caused damages in 37 districts of Balochistan, 33 districts in Sindh, 25 districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, seven in Punjab, four in Gilgit-Baltistan and four districts in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
In addition, more than 949,858 houses were badly destroyed, two million acres of crops were badly impacted and 719,558 livestock animals were lost.
While speaking to PHF members, Julien Harneis, resident coordinator of the UN, said such a massive crisis required national and international solidarity for collective, coordinated and effective response.
PHF Executive Committee Chairman Farhan Ahmed Khan said to bring people back to normal life required massive efforts at all levels. He said the government should facilitate INGOs and humanitarian agencies who played a highly crucial role in these testing times.
A total of 22 INGOs including Action against Hunger -ACF, Care International, HelpAge, HHRD, Helvetas, Human Appeal, IMC, International Rescue Committee, Islamic Relief, Muslim Aid, Muslim Hands, NCA, Qatar Charity, Relief International, Save the Children, Tearfund, SIF, WHH -Welthungerhilfe-, CBM, AKAH, WaterAid, Mercy Corps were providing extensive response and reached out to 153,898 people affected by floods.

5,Only 37.7pc infants given mother’s milk in Pakistan: WHO,"The practice reduces chances of breast cancer, other diseases among women, official says...","TAXILA: Mother’s milk for at least the first six months of a baby’s life shields him or her from a range of diseases.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), only 37.7pc of new mothers in Pakistan breast feed their children, which leads to several health issues for them including early death, low IQ, problems in physical growth and so on. Optimal nutrition for children under the age of two is essential as it lowers morbidity and mortality and fosters better development overall.
This was highlighted by speakers during seminars organised in connection with Breastfeeding Week, which is observed all over the world. The week is observed to raise awareness among people about the benefits of breastfeeding for both infants and new mothers.
Chief Executive Officer District Health Authority Dr Jawad Ellahi said improving access to skilled counselling for women could do wonders.

The practice reduces chances of breast cancer, other diseases among women, official says

National Programme for Family Planning and Primary Health Care Dr Saeed Akhtar said there was no alternative to mother’s milk for a child as it was full of nutrients, vitamins and minerals. 
Babies who have been given mother’s milk live healthier lives whereas this natural practice reduces not only the chances of breast cancer but other complicated diseases in women, he said, adding that breastfeeding week took place at a time when experts were calling for vaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding women on a priority basis. 
This week - Aug 29 to Sept 3 - health workers will go door-to-door to talk to pregnant women and new mothers.
During the week, walks at Tehsil Headquarters (THQ) Hospital, RHC primary health centres and MCH centres across the district will be held and banners displayed.
District Population Welfare Officer Dr Zafar Iqbal Rehmani said in Pakistan there was a lack of knowledge regarding the significance and benefits of mother’s milk. He said optimal breastfeeding meant a child should be immediately breastfed within the first hour after delivery and exclusively breastfed, with no water, fruit, formula milk or other foods, for the first six months.
Assistant Commissioner Samman Abbas said the government promulgated the Protection of Breast Feeding and Child Nutrition Ordinance 2002 on Oct 26, 2002. After the 18th Constitutional Amendment, all provincial governments replicated the legislation. A walk was later conducted to create awareness in this regard.

During his visit to rural health centre he was informed that the centre had lab facility but most of the equipment including the X-ray machine were out of order.
Tehsil Headquarters Hospital was presenting a picture of neglect as building was poorly maintained. Stagnant water welcomed the newly posted deputy commissioner to hospital’s staff colony.
He instructed the officials there to activate the facilities at the rural health centre within a week besides addressing the issue of paucity of the staff.
During his visit to the THQ Hospital he also reviewed the construction work of the trauma center. 
He was informed by the patients present at the hospital that night doctors allegedly indulged in private practices during their duty hours.
He was informed that patients, especially of road accidents, became shuttlecock between THQ and RHC due to doctors’ alleged bureaucratic attitude. 
He was stunned to see water accumulated at the staff colony and pathetic condition of official buildings. 
He took serious notice of the poor healthcare system in Hazro town and instructed the authorities concerned to address the issues within a week failing which departmental action would be taken against them.

The oath was administered to him by the AJK president at the Aiwan-i-Sadr. The notification whereby Mr Gujjar was reinstated by Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas was issued late on Monday. He was allotted his previous portfolio of industries and commerce.

Mr Gujjar was removed by PM Ilyas on August 17. Though the official notification to this effect had not cited any reason for the move, a handout had attributed his removal to his “constant violations of the code of conduct, party policy and the Rules of Business.”
Contrarily, Mr Gujjar had maintained that he was ousted because of his opposition to the moves by all major parliamentary parties, including the PTI, “to hold the long overdue local bodies elections in abeyance.”
Recently, Mr Gujjar had called on PM Ilyas and according to the sources in the PM office he had offered regrets to him.

10,Pakistan committed towards fostering trade ties with Asean: Khar,ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is committed towards forging closer ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is committed towards forging closer ties with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), fostering bilateral trade and most importantly people-to-people contact.
This was pointed out by Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar.
Ms Khar had joined the Asean Committee in Islamabad (ACI) which comprises of seven resident diplomatic missions of member states Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam to celebrate Asean Day and commemorate the 55th anniversary of the formation of the regional cooperation group. The ceremony, held at Serena Hotel, began with the hoisting of the Asean flag followed by a performance of its anthem.
During her keynote speech, Ms Khar highlighted the central role of Asean in the region and its relationship with Pakistan.
“No goals are bigger and better than peace and prosperity for the people of the region,” she said, adding that Asean had made a remarkable journey, transforming into an integrated and vibrant economic community, forging dialogue and cooperation. She said Asean provided a blue print for regional peace and cooperation.
The event began with members of the committee expressing sympathy and condolences over the loss of more than 1,000 lives resulting from the unprecedented floods in Sindh and Balochistan recently, and with the hope that people would soon overcome these natural catastrophes.
In his speech, the current chairman of ACI, Ambassador of Vietnam Nguyen Tien Phong, reviewed the process of Asean’s establishment, development and achievements during the last 55 years and also its pillars and priorities to stay strong and important contributions towards peace, security, stability and prosperity of Southeast Asia, Asia Pacific, Indo-Pacific and the world at large.
“Its achievements have constituted a strong foundation for Asean to fulfill the Asean Vision 2025 and further advance an Asean community of solidarity, resilience and responsiveness. Asean has remained true to its mission and goal. It has, therefore, brought into play its important roles in promoting dialogue, cooperation and confidence-building between the countries within and beyond the region with a view to maintaining peace, stability, cooperation and development in the region,” he said.
Mr Phong also said all member countries stood as one to give priority to cooperation in the areas of disaster relief, terrorism and transnational crime combat, maritime security, defence, peacekeeping, counter-proliferation of nuclear weapons, and disarmament. 
They attached importance to dialogue, goodwill cooperation and responsible contribution for the common goal of peace, security, stability and development in promoting peace and stability through trust-building measures and preventive diplomacy, maintaining a nuclear-weapons-free Southeast Asia, inclusive processes for preventive diplomacy and conflict resolution, he said.
“Asean and all of its partners in general and Pakistan in particular have many things in common like culture, dressing, cuisines and religions. Pakistan is a very important part in the process of development and spreading of Buddhism. We share the values of unity in diversity, integrations and connectivity for developments and we strongly believe that we will share and move forward together,” he said.
Participants of the event were informed that Asean had long-standing cooperation with Pakistan. Pakistan was accorded the sectoral dialogue status of Asean at the 26th Asean Ministerial Meeting in July 1993. In July 2004, Pakistan acceded to the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia and admitted as the 24th participant of the Asean Regional Forum (ARF).
They were also informed that Pakistan’s trade with Asean had reached almost $11 billion in fiscal year 2022. Asean and Pakistan have undertaken cooperation in trade, industry and investment, science and technology, drugs and narcotics, environment, tourism, and human resources development.
The event concluded with cultural performances from the embassies of Indonesia and Thailand and martial arts demonstrations from a Pakistani team.
Guests were treated to delicacies such as Thai beef rending, Malaysian chicken satay and spaghetti goring, besides Chinese braised bok chay garlic and Indonesian chicken adobo.

On Tuesday, representatives form the of ministry of health wanted to brief the committee on the PMC but Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) legislator Zahra Wadood Fatemi said there was no reason for giving a briefing on the PMC as it did not exist anymore.

Endorses health ministry’s recommendation to postpone medical colleges’ entry test

The ministry representatives said the matter regarding the regulator (PMC) was yet to be sent to the president.
The representatives of the PMC were also present, but Ms Fatemi said PMC should not be called a regulator. The committee then decided not to take a briefing from the PMC.
On August 20, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif withdrew the nomination of PMC’s seven out of nine members.
The PMC was established in 2020 after dissolving the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) through the Pakistan Medical Commission Ordinance 2019.
On Aug 24, the premier constituted a search committee, comprising seven members, which will appoint members to the Medical and Dental Council and the National Medical and Dental Academic Board of the PMC.
Moreover, a bill to repeal the PMC has been passed by the National Assembly and from the standing committee of the Senate.
Ms Fatemi said MDCAT cannot be held due to the prevailing situation of floods in the country.
On her request, the committee also recommended the cancellation of the admission test.
On Aug 27, after receiving requests from Sindh and Balochistan, the ministry of NHS had decided to postpone the MDCAT till further orders.
“We got requests from both the provinces that due to heavy rains and floods it was not possible for them to hold and provide security for the MDCAT. So it has been decided to postpone the exam scheduled from September 7 to September 30. We deliberately did not announce the next date of MDCAT as we want to start it at the earliest. As soon as things come under control, we will announce the new schedule. So I suggest to the candidates to keep preparing for the exam,” Director Regulations at the ministry Dr Baseer Khan Achakzai had told media.
However, only the PMC can take the final decision so there was confusion if MDCAT will be held as earlier scheduled or not.
The committee also took notice of the shortage of nurses across the country and directed the ministry to take steps to increase the number of nursing students.

The CTO instructed all circle in-charges to maintain communication with transporters, traders, school and college administrations and streamline traffic issues besides checking wrong parking and encroachments.
“In future, if any traffic violations or difficulties are noticed in any circle, show-cause notices will be issued to the concerned circle in-charge,” the CTO warned.
When contacted, a former chief traffic officer contested the CTO’s claim that circle in-charges were responsible for the elimination of wrong parking and encroachments.

CTO says show-cause notices to be served on officials in case of traffic rule violations, other issues

He said this approach was wrong because elimination of encroachments did not fall in the jurisdiction traffic police and if the traffic staff took any action the encroachers go on strike which would result in the suspension of traffic inspector concerned.
He said it would be sufficient if the police could ensure that 50 per cent of the traffic regulations were followed on roads and wardens were enforcing the traffic laws. A traffic police spokesman said on Tuesday that the CTO directed all circles in-charges to keep in touch with stakeholders including transporters, traders, school and college administrations in their circles. They will be responsible for elimination of wrong parking and encroachments.
“In future if any traffic violation or problem is observed in any circle, a show-cause notice will be issued to the concerned circle in-charge,” he quoted the CTO as saying.
A meeting was held with circle in-charges at the traffic headquarters to ensure smooth traffic flow in the city, eliminate wrong parking and encroachments as well as compliance with traffic rules.
The CTO said for the elimination of encroachments from roads, operations should be conducted on a daily basis with the relevant departments and the traffic problems should be resolved through teamwork so that the road users can get the direct benefit.
Apart from this, all the circle in-charges should send reports about traffic problems and proposals for their possible solutions to the traffic headquarters on a daily basis.
It may be noted that since the CTO has assumed the charge, he has not come up with any traffic plan/strategy to facilitate the road users either in the city or cantonment areas.
