0,"China, Taiwan trade barbs over drone sorties into island",Taiwan’s president vows  “strong countermeasures” against such incursions.,"TAIPEI: Taipei and Beijing have traded barbs over a recent string of drone sorties from the Chinese mainland to an outlying Taiwanese island, as Taiwan’s president on Tuesday vowed  “strong countermeasures” against such incursions.
Photos and video taken by Chinese drones of the Kinmen islands have been circulating on both Taiwa­nese and Chinese social media, with one video showing Taiwanese soldiers hurling rocks at one to drive it off.
While visiting air force facilities in offshore Penghu islands, President Tsai Ing-wen said China had used  “greyzone” tactics such as drone intrusion to continue its  “military intimidation” against Taiwan.
“I want to tell everyone that the more provocative the enemy is, the more calm we need to be... we will not provoke a war and we will restrain ourselves, but that does not mean that we will not take countermoves,” she told the troops stationed in the archipelago in the Taiwan Strait.
Tsai added that she had ordered the defence ministry  “to take necessary and strong countermeasures at an appropriate time to defend the security of our airspace”.
Asked to comment on the videos, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the incursions were not  “anything worth making a fuss about” as the drones were  “flying around Chinese territory”.
But that response triggered an angry riposte from Taipei, which compared the drone harassment to the acts of a  “thief”.
“Those who come uninvited are called thieves, whether they are breaking through the door or peeping from the air, the people of Taiwan do not welcome such thieves,” Taiwan’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
“The authoritarian expansionist government of the Chinese Communist Party has always made harassing other countries a daily routine, and therefore its title of a ‘regional troublemaker’ is well deserved.” Taiwan lives under constant threat of invasion by China, which claims the self-ruled democratic island as part of its territory to be seized one day — by force if necessary.
Drone incursions over Kinmen have increased at the same time Beijing embarked on a show of force in retaliation for US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan earlier this month.
For a week after Pelosi’s visit, China sent warships, missiles and fighter jets into the waters and skies around Taiwan, its largest and most aggressive exercises since the mid-1990s. It is not clear who is flying the drones from the Chinese mainland.
Kinmen lies just a few kilometres off China’s coast, meaning a civilian could feasibly fly a commercial drone that distance.
However China has also stepped up so-called  “greyzone” tactics against Taiwan in recent years to pressure the island. “Greyzone” is a term used by military analysts to describe aggressive actions by a state that stop short of open warfare and can use civilians.
Civilian Chinese fishing and sand dredging vessels, for example, have increasingly entered waters around Taiwanese outlying islands in recent years. China has also ramped up incursions by warplanes into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone, an area it previously tended to avoid.
Taiwan’s defence ministry has so far only fired flares to warn off the drones but it has said it will take  “necessary countermeasures”, including shooting down the drones if needed.

1,Death of girl set ablaze in Jharkhand sparks anger,Police say the accused poured kerosene on the victim as she slept.,"LUCKNOW: Indian police on Tuesday formed a special investigative unit to probe the death of a girl who said she had been set on fire by a stalker whose marriage proposal she rejected, a case that has led to anger in a country where violence against women is rife.
Hardline Hindu groups have called for death to the accused, a Muslim man who police said lived in the same locality as the victim, a Hindu, in the Dumka district of the eastern state of Jharkhand.
Police said the man poured kerosene on the victim, named as Ankita, through her house window when she was asleep and set her on fire last Tuesday. She died in hospital of severe burn injuries on Sunday.
“Two senior officials have been deployed in the town and they will coordinate with the district police chief in the probe,” said Amol V. Homkar, a spokesperson for Jharkhand police, adding that the accused and a co-accused had been arrested.
The Vishva Hindu Parishad, or the World Hindu Council, said the majority Hindu community would hit the streets in protest if appropriate action was not taken.
District authorities have restricted the movement of people to prevent any fallout from the incident.
“After the cruelty meted out to Ankita, her death has made every Indian bow their heads in shame,” Rahul Gandhi, a leader of the main opposition Congress party, said on Twitter.
“Today, there is a dire need to create a safe environment for women in the country.”

2,Ukraine grain ship with aid for Ethiopia docks in Djibouti,"DJIBOUTI: A UN-chartered ship loaded with 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat destined for millions of hungry people in...","DJIBOUTI: A UN-chartered ship loaded with 23,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat destined for millions of hungry people in Ethiopia docked in neighbouring Djibouti on Tuesday.
The bulk carrier MV Brave Commander arrived in the Horn of Africa port city two weeks after leaving a Black Sea port in Ukraine, the UN’s World Food Programme said.
“The food on the Brave Commander will feed 1.5 million people for one month in Ethiopia,” WFP’s regional director for East Africa, Mike Dunford, said in video footage provided by the agency from the port.
“So this makes a very big impact for those people who currently have nothing. And now WFP will be able to provide them with their basic needs.” Ethiopia, along with Kenya and Somalia, is in the grip of a devastating drought that has left 22 million people at risk of starvation across the Horn of Africa, the WFP said earlier this month. The WFP said the wheat from the Brave Commander was being transported to its operations in Ethiopia.
It was not immediately clear whether the delivery would be affected by a resumption of fighting between government forces and Tigrayan rebels in the north of the country.
Ukraine, one of the world’s largest grain exporters, was forced to halt almost all deliveries after Russia’s invasion in February, raising fears of a global food crisis.
But exports of grain, food and fertilisers from three Black Sea ports resumed at the start of this month under a deal between Kyiv and Moscow, brokered by the UN and Turkey in July.
The agreement lifted a Russian blockade of Ukraine’s ports and set terms for millions of tonnes of wheat and other grain to start flowing from silos and ports.
According to figures late last week from the Joint Coordination Centre which manages the sea corridor, more than 720,000 tonnes of grain have already left Ukraine.
The WFP said the Djibouti port is one of the main corridors it uses for its operations across Eastern and Central Africa, handling 960,000 tonnes of food commodities in 2021.
The Horn of Africa is experiencing its worst drought in 40 years and the UN’s World Meteorological Organisation warned last week that the situation is set to get even worse with a fifth consecutive failed rainy season.
“There is still no end in sight to this drought crisis, so we must get the resources needed to save lives and stop people plunging into catastrophic levels of hunger and starvation,” WFP executive director David Beasley said earlier this month.
The WFP has warned that famine is a  “serious risk,” particularly in Somalia where nearly half the population of 15 million is seriously hungry.
The WFP says food insecurity and malnutrition are a major concern across Ethiopia, with an estimated 20.4 million people in need of food support, including those forced from their homes by the conflict in the north as well as the severe drought in the south and southeast.
Northern Ethiopia has been wracked by war since November 2020 when Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops into Tigray to topple the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) after what he said were attacks by the rebels on federal army camps.

3,Che Guevara’s son dies in Venezuela,Camilo Guevara March visiting Venezuela when he died due to a blood clot that led to a heart attack.,"HAVANA: Camilo Guevara March, the eldest son of communist revolutionary icon Ernesto  “Che” Guevara, died in Caracas aged 60, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said on Tuesday.
According to Prensa Latina, Guevara March was visiting Venezuela when he died on Monday due to a blood clot that led to a heart attack.
“It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to Camilo, son of Che and promoter of his ideas,” said Diaz-Canel on Twitter.

 





 
He was the eldest of four children that Argentine Guevara had with Cuban Aleida March.
Guevara also had a daughter, Hilda, from a previous marriage to Peruvian Hilda Gadea.
A graduate in labour law, Guevara March was the director of the Center for Che Guevara Studies in Havana, an institution dedicated to promoting the work and ideology of his father, who remains a hugely influential figure in Cuba.
Born in Argentina, Guevara studied medicine before traveling through Latin America, when he met Cuban revolutionaries Fidel and Raul Castro in Mexico.
Guevara joined their army and helped overthrow US-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista, before later unsuccessfully atte­mp­ting to spark similar Mar­xist revolutions in Congo and then Bolivia, where he was shot dead by a soldier in 1967 at age 39.

4,Want to save carbon and land? Study suggests wooden cities,PARIS: Housing people in homes made from wood instead of steel and concrete could save more than 100 billion tonnes...,"PARIS: Housing people in homes made from wood instead of steel and concrete could save more than 100 billion tonnes of carbon emissions while preserving enough cropland to feed a booming population, research suggested on Tuesday.
More than half of people globally currently live in cities and this proportion is set to rise markedly by 2050. According to some estimates, the infrastructure needed to accommodate up to 10 billion people by mid-century could exceed that constructed since the dawn of the industrial era.
That places a huge emphasis on emissions from construction, one of the most polluting sectors and historically one of the trickiest to decarbonise.
Were all new construction projects carried out using steel and concrete, that could claim up to 60 percent of Earth’s remaining carbon budget for 2C of warming — that is, how much pollution the global economy can produce and still stay within the Paris Agreement temperature guardrail.
Scientists in Germany and Taiwan wanted to see how much carbon could be saved if firms switched to wood to build new homes instead. They used an open-source land use model to simulate four different building scenarios: one with conventional materials like cement and steel, and three with additional demand for timber.
They also analysed how additional high wood demand could be satisfied, where it could be produced, and the impacts new tree plantations might have on biodiversity and crop production.
They found that housing people in timber homes could avoid more than 100 billion tonnes of CO2 by 2100 — that’s around 10 percent of the remaining 2C carbon budget, equivalent to nearly three years of global emissions.
Wood is known to be the least carbon-intensive building material as trees absorb CO2 as they grow, explained the study lead author Abhijeet Mishra, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
“Production of engineered wood releases much less CO2 than production of steel and cement,” he said.  “Engineered wood also stores carbon, making timber cities a unique long-term carbon sink.” He said that engineered wood was the ideal material for constructing  “mid-rise” buildings — between four and 12 stories — to house growing urban populations.
The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, found that around 140 million hectares — an area larger than Peru — would be needed to grow new trees to meet the increased demand under the timber-led building scenario.

5,French-Indian textile designer brings back Mughal patterns,"""I was the first to give a renaissance to this kind of Mughal design,"" 67-year-old Brigitte Sindh says.","AMBER: Textiles designer Brigitte Singh lovingly lays out a piece of cloth embossed with a red poppy plant she says was probably designed for emperor Shah Jahan, builder of the Taj Mahal, four centuries ago.
For Singh — who moved from France to India 42 years ago and married into a maharaja’s family — this exquisite piece remains the ever-inspiring heart of her studio’s mission.
The 67-year-old is striving to keep alive the art of block printing, which flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries under the conquering but sophisticated Mughal dynasty that then ruled India.
“I was the first to give a renaissance to this kind of Mughal design,” Singh said in her traditional printing workshop in Rajasthan.
Having studied decorative arts in Paris, Singh arrived aged 25 in 1980 in western India’s Jaipur, the  “last bastion” of the technique of using carved blocks of wood to print patterns on material.
“I dreamed of practising (miniature art) in Isfahan. But the Ayatollahs had just arrived in Iran (in the Islamic revolution of 1979). Or Herat, but the Soviets had just arrived in Afghanistan,” she remembers. “So by default, I ended up in Jaipur,” she said.
A few months after arriving, Singh was introduced to a member of the local nobility who was related to the maharaja of Rajasthan. They married in 1982. At first, Singh still hoped to try her hand at miniature painting. But after scouring the city for traditional paper to work on, she came across workshops using block printing.

6,France to expel imam for ‘hate speech’,"Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin calls ruling  ""a big victory for the Republic"".","PARIS: France’s highest administrative court ruled on Tuesday that a France-born Moroccan imam whom the government had accused of promoting hate could be deported, a court ruling showed.
That decision overturned a previous ruling by a Paris court suspending a deportation order against Hassan Iquioussen in July for  “inciting hate, discrimination and violence”, notably against the Jewish community and women.
The Conseil d’Etat, which acts as the supreme court for administrative justice, found, contrary to the first ruling, that his deportation to Morocco would not be a disproportionate interference with his right to lead a normal private and family life. Iquioussen, 58, was born in France and his immediate family lives there, though he does not have French nationality.
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin took to Twitter following the ruling, calling it  “a big victory for the Republic. He will be deported from national soil.”

 





 
Iquioussen’s lawyer Lucie Simon also reacted to the decision on Twitter, saying the legal battle was not over and that her client was still considering going to the European Court of Human Rights. “Discriminations are not fought by creating new ones,” she wrote.
During a lengthy hearing last week, Simon said her client was conservative and made backward and regrettable comments, but that it didn’t make him a threat to public order.

7,"Iran seized, then released US Navy drone vessel: Pentagon","Says actions were ""flagrant, unwarranted and inconsistent with the behavior of a professional maritime force"".","WASHINGTON: An Iranian ship seized an American military unmanned research vessel in the Gulf but released it after a US Navy patrol boat and helicopter were deployed to the location, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.
The US Central Command’s 5th Fleet said a support ship from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy, the Shahid Baziar, was spotted towing the seven-meter (23-foot) Saildrone Explorer unmanned surface vessel (USV) late on Monday.
The US naval drone, equipped with an array of sensors, radars and cameras, was in international waters collecting navigation and other unspecified data, the 5th Fleet said in a statement.
When the Iranian vessel was seen towing the unmanned boat, US forces sent the USS Thunderbolt coastal patrol ship, which was operating nearby, to the scene. In addition, an MH-60S Seahawk helicopter based in Bahrain flew to the location.
Those actions  “resulted in the IRGCN vessel disconnecting the towing line to the USV and departing the area approximately four hours later” without further incident, the 5th Fleet said.
“IRGCN’s actions were flagrant, unwarranted and inconsistent with the behavior of a professional maritime force,” said Vice Admiral Brad Cooper, commander of US Naval Forces Central Command, in a statement.
“US naval forces remain vigilant and will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows while promoting rules-based international order throughout the region,” he added.
With solar panels and a sail wing five meters tall, the Saildrone Explorer is driven by solar and wind energy and can be deployed on missions on the ocean for up to one year, monitored remotely by a human pilot.
It can collect a broad range of oceanic, navigational and meteorological data, as well as strategic intelligence.
The 5th Fleet stressed the vessel was US government property but that the technology it carries is  “available commercially” and  “does not store sensitive or classified information.” The US Navy first began operational testing of the USV in the Gulf of Aqaba last December.

8,Turkish cryptocurrency boss arrested in Albania,"ISTANBUL: The founder of cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, suspected of having fled Turkey with the assets of his...","ISTANBUL: The founder of cryptocurrency exchange Thodex, suspected of having fled Turkey with the assets of his clients, has been arrested in Albania, the Turkish interior ministry said on Tuesday.
Turkey issued an international arrest warrant in April last year for fugitive businessman Faruk Fatih Ozer, who fled with a reported $2 billion in investors’ assets.
Tirana had informed Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu that Ozer, who was wanted by Interpol,  “was arrested in Vlora, Albania”, the ministry said.
It added that  “extradition procedures to Turkey have been initiated.” The Istanbul-based Thodex exchange launched aggressive campaigns to lure investors.
It first pledged to distribute luxury cars through a flashy advertising campaign featuring famous Turkish models.
But the exchange suspended trading in April 2021 after having posted a mysterious message days earlier saying it needed five days to deal with an unspecified outside investment.
It went dark after running a promotional campaign that sold Dogecoins at one-fourth the price at which they were trading on other exchanges.
But the exchange locked in those investments and did not allow the coins to be either sold or converted into other cryptos.
Turkish security officials then released a photo of Ozer going through passport control at Istanbul airport on his way to an unspecified location.
Media reports said the exchange shut down while holding at least $2 billion from 391,000 investors and more than 60 people linked to the company were arrested.
In a statement Tuesday Albanian police said the 28-year-old Ozer had been arrested at a hotel in Himara, a small town in southern Albania on the Ionian coast.
Two people suspected of having assisted him were also arrested, police said, with computers, mobile pho­nes and bank cards seized.
Footage released by the Albanian police shows a man lying on a bed in a hotel room with his hands restrained behind his back.
Two days after leaving Turkey last year, Ozer deno­unced the  “baseless allegations” against him in a message posted on his company’s official Twitter account.
The businessman said he had gone abroad to meet investors.
“I will return to Turkey in a few days and cooperate with the judicial authorities so that the truth comes out,” he promised at the time. The manhunt for Ozer came as Turkey’s crypto market started to unravel.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government warned of the risks and announced plans to rein in the digital currency market.
In the same week, officials blocked the account of the Vebitcoin exchange and launched an investigation after it also abruptly ceased operations.
Many Turks turned to cryptocurrencies in an attempt to preserve their savings during a steep drop in the value of the lira and runaway inflation.
