0,Serena battles on as US Open farewell underway,"23-time Grand Slam winner draws on all of her experience to down lowly ranked Montenegrin opponent Danka Kovinic 6-3, 6-3.","NEW YORK: Serena Williams delayed her farewell to tennis on an electrifying opening night at the US Open on Monday as the sporting icon battled to victory in front of a star-studded crowd.
The 23-time Grand Slam winner — who earlier this month signalled she plans to retire from tennis after the tournament — drew on all of her experience to down lowly ranked Montenegrin opponent Danka Kovinic 6-3, 6-3.
A galaxy of celebrities ranging from Hollywood stars, fashion icons and former presidents were out in force at Flushing Meadows’ Arthur Ashe Stadium to watch could have been Serena final appearance in a Grand Slam singles match.
But the 40-year-old ensured that her legions of fans will have at least one more chance to savour her talents as she dug out victory despite an error-strewn display.
“I feel so comfortable on this court and in front of everyone here,” a jubilant Serena said after her victory.
“The crowd was crazy — they really helped pull me through. I was really pumped,” added Serena, who won the first of her Grand Slam titles in the same arena in 1999 as a 17-year-old prodigy.
Serena admitted that deciding to walk away from the sport after 27 years as a professional was  “such a hard decision. I think when you are passionate about something it is always hard to walk away,” she said.  
“I have been trying to decide what to do. I love this game.
“But I was just like ‘Alright, I think now’s the time’. I have a family, there’s other chapters in life. I call it evolution.” 
Serena later refused to be definitive about her retirement however when asked if the US Open would be her last tournament, teasing the possibility that she may yet play on.
“I’ve been pretty vague about it, right?” she said.  “I’m going to stay vague because you never know.” A sell-out crowd of 23,500 had roared its appreciation for Serena as she strode into the arena wearing a striking sparkling bodice and black skirt comprised of six layers — one for every US Open title she has won.
The roll-call of A-listers on hand for the occasion included former US President Bill Clinton, Vogue editor Anna Wintour, former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson, tennis legend and Hollywood stars such as Hugh Jackman and Queen Latifah.
Serena acknowledged that leaving the spotlight — whenever that is — would be a wrench.
“The more tournaments I play, I feel like the more I can belong out there,” she said.  “That’s a tough feeling to have, to leave knowing the more you do it, the more you can shine.”
In other women’s draw action on Monday, former world number one  Simona Halep, seeded seventh, was the biggest casualty in the first  round, crashing out 6-2, 0-6, 6-4 to Ukrainian qualifier Daria Snigur.
But there were no such problems for US teenager and 12th seed Coco Gauff, who cruised past France’s Leolia Jeanjean 6-2, 6-3.
Third seed Maria Sakkari overcame a wobble to beat Tatjana Maria 6-4 3-6  6-0 and gain revenge against the German who upset her en route to the  Wimbledon semi-finals this year. Also reaching the second round were  Caroline Garcia who beat Kamilla Rakhimova 6-2 6-4 and Veronika  Kudermetova after her 7-5 6-3 victory over Donna Vekic.
TSITSIPAS STUNNED
Meanwhile the men’s draw got under way with a stunning upset for Greek fourth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas, who was bundled out by Colombian qualifier Daniel Elahi Galan 6-0, 6-1, 3-6, 7-5.
Earlier, Russia’s defending champion Daniil Medvedev routed Stefan Koslov of the United States in the top half of the draw.
The Russian comfortably dispatched world No.111 Kozlov 6-2, 6-4, 6-0 in 2hrs 1min.
Medvedev, bidding to become the first man to defend the US crown since Roger Federer retained the title in 2008, faces France’s Arthur Rinderknech in the second round.
Britain’s Andy Murray, another veteran well into the twilight of his career, marked the 10th anniversary of his maiden Grand Slam win with a straight sets defeat of Argentinian 24th seed Francisco Cerundolo.
The 35-year-old Scot showed no signs of recent cramping problems in a 7-5, 6-3, 6-3 win, but admitted afterwards:  “It felt like five sets.” It was Murray’s first straight sets win at a Grand Slam event since 2017.
Elsewhere Monday, Wu Yibing claimed a piece of history in the men’s draw, becoming the first man from China to win a Grand Slam singles match since 1959.
The qualifier upset Georgia’s 31st seed Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-3, 6-4, 6-0.
But there was agony for China’s other player in the men’s draw, Zhang Zhizhen who squandered seven match points in a 3-6, 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (11/9), 6-1, 6-4 defeat to Tim Van Rijthoven of the Netherlands.

1,"Najibullah, spinners power Afghanistan to Asia Cup Super 4",Afghanistan secure crushing seven-wicket win over Bangladesh after chasing 128.,"SHARJAH: Najibullah Zadran tore into the opposition attack with six sixes to lead Afghanistan into the Asia Cup Super 4 stage with a crushing seven-wicket win over Bangladesh here at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.
Chasing a modest-looking 128 for victory, Afghanistan were in trouble at 62-3 when Najibullah (43) joined Ibrahim Zadran (42) for an unbeaten stand of 69 as they won by nine balls to spare.
Frontline spinners Mujeeb Ur Rahman and Rashid Khan took three wickets each to set up victory as Afghanistan restricted the opposition to 127-7 after Bangladesh elected to bat first.
Afghanistan, led by Mohammad Nabi, registered their second straight victory to become the first of the six teams to enter the next stage of the competition, which acts as a tune-up to the T20 World Cup in October-November.
Afghanistan lost Rahmanullah Gurbaz for 11 when skipper Shakib Al Hasan, playing his 100th T20 International, got the opener stumped with his left-arm spin.
Mosaddek Hossain got Hazratullah Zazai out for 23 with his off spin as Afghanistan seemed to lose control of their chase with runs hard to come by.
They were trouble when skipper Mohammad Nabi departed in the 13th over and Bangladesh supporters, who clearly outnumbered the Afghans, raised the roof.
But the left-handed Najibullah timed the chase to perfection as he finished with a flurry of sixes and one four in his 17-ball blitz.
The innings put Ibrahim’s knock in shade as he hit four fours in his 41-ball stay.
Earlier Mujeeb, a spinner who can turn the ball both ways, shared the new ball with left-arm quick Fazalhaq Farooqi and struck in each of his first three overs, including the key wicket of Shakib for 11.
Rashid, a leg-spinner, joined forces with Mujeeb after six overs of powerplay — when only two fielders are allowed outside the inner circle — to send back wicket-keeper/batter Mushfiqur Rahim trapped lbw for one.
Mushfiqur failed to pick a superb Rashid googly which the umpire gave not out only for Afghanistan to successfully review the decision in their favour.
Afif Hossain and Mahmudullah Riyad attempted to rebuild but Rashid broke through with a another googly that trapped the left-handed Afif lbw. He made 12.
Rashid struck again and cut short Mahmudullah’s stay on 25 as the batsman top-edged a shot to deep mid-wicket.
Mosaddek Hossain then took on the bowlers to smash four boundaries and a six in his late blitz of 48, but Afghanistan finished by giving away just seven runs in the final over that included a run out.

2,England’s Ballance welcome to play for Zimbabwe: Houghton,TOWNSVILLE: Former England batsman Gary Ballance will be welcomed to play for Zimbabwe should he decide to return to...,"TOWNSVILLE: Former England batsman Gary Ballance will be welcomed to play for Zimbabwe should he decide to return to the country of his birth, Zimbabwe coach Dave Houghton said on Tuesday.
Harare-born Ballance moved to England as a schoolboy and played 23 Tests and 16 One-day Internationals before falling out of favour.
The 32-year-old has not played for England since a 2017 Test at Nottingham and recently apologised for using racist language against former Yorkshire team-mate Azeem Rafiq.
Houghton said his wife and Ballance’s father were cousins.
“I’ve known Gary since he was a kid and I speak to him reasonable regularly,” the former captain told reporters ahead of the team’s second One-day match against Australia on Wednesday.
“I don’t think Gary would be against coming back to play for Zimbabwe but he’s still got to sort out things in England.
“I think he’s probably got another eight to nine good years in him, so if he wants to come back we certainly won’t turn him away.”  
Australia coasted to a five-wicket victory in the first One-dyer on Saturday with 16.3 overs to spare.
Zimbabwe have been boosted by the return of all-rounder Sean Williams, who missed the opener with an elbow bruise suffered in the nets.

3,"Mitchell Marsh ruled out of remaining Zimbabwe ODIs, New Zealand series",All-rounder suffers ankle injury.,"TOWNSVILLE: All-rounder Mitchell Marsh has been withdrawn from the squad for Australia’s five remaining One-day Internationals in Queensland over the next two weeks because of an ankle injury.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Josh Inglis has been called up to replace Marsh for the remaining two matches against Zimbabwe in Towsnville and the three-match series against New Zealand in Cairns.
The withdrawal of Marsh with ankle soreness was precautionary given his importance to the Twenty20 team, who will defend the World Cup they won last year on home soil in October and November.
“Not ideal for Mitch, he’s been playing some good white-ball cricket recently,” former captain Steve Smith told reporters on Tuesday. “And obviously the way we set up our team the other day with bulk all-rounders, he was a big part of that. Disappointing for Mitch but there’s some pretty important stuff coming up.
“He was a big part of our T20 World Cup campaign last year and I’m sure there’s big plans for him this year, so the priority is to get him right for that.”
Marsh took the first wicket of the Australia’s 2022-23 season when he had Zimbabwe opener Innocent Kaia caught and bowled in the opening one-dayer on Sunday, which the hosts won by five wickets.
Smith, who scored 48 not out, was happy with his first innings of the season and said he hoped to become a fixture at number three in Australia’s batting order in short format cricket. “Who wouldn’t want to be facing the newish ball in any white ball cricket?” he added.
“That’s where my record’s probably best. I think I’ve done a reasonable job over a period of time at number three and, yeah, that’s my most comfortable spot.”
The second ODI against Zimbabwe takes place at the Riverway Stadium on Wednesday.

Rohit Sharma’s men can book a spot in the Super Four stage with victory after a tense opening win over arch-rivals Pakistan.
The Hong Kong team is largely made up of expats, led by Pakistan-born captain Nizakat Khan.
Hong Kong, with a population of 7.5 million, will face powerhouse India, a cricket-mad country of 1.4 billion people, in a T20 International for the first time.
“Definitely we are going to play with a positive mindset and we are not going to take them lightly because in T20 on a given day anything could happen,” Jadeja told reporters. “So will look to play positive cricket and give our best.”
India justified their favourites tag in the six-nation tournament, which acts as a tune-up to the T20 World Cup in October-November, after they edged out Pakistan in Dubai and need just one more win to make the next stage from Group A.
Jadeja, hitting 35 with the bat, played a key role in India’s victory as they chased down a target of 148 with two balls to spare.
His 52-run fifth-wicket partnership with Hardik Pandya, who made an unbeaten 33, proved crucial.
“If a team has so many options then they are bound to play freely and the opposition will feel the pressure,” said Jadeja.
“And we have the kind of batting line-up that can tackle any situation.”
Hong Kong, an associate cricket nation, made the main draw by winning all their qualifying matches against the UAE, Kuwait and Singapore.
Nizakat, a 30-year-old all-rounder, said this tournament provides his side a massive opportunity to learn from the heavyweights.
“Playing against India and Pakistan is a massive opportunity,” Nizakat, who sat alongside head coach and former Ireland captain Trent Johnston, told reporters.
“We need to make sure we learn from them (big teams). We have a nice squad and this is a learning process for us.”

5,United agree deal to sign Antony for 100m euros from Ajax,"MANCHESTER: Man­chester United have reached an agreement to sign Brazil forward Antony from Ajax, the English...","MANCHESTER: Man­chester United have reached an agreement to sign Brazil forward Antony from Ajax, the English Premier League club announced Tuesday.
Ajax said they have agreed a transfer fee of 95 million euros (81 million). Including add-ons, the fee could rise to 100 million euros (86 million).
Dutch national news agency ANP said that if the deal goes through, it will be a record for an Eredivisie player, surpassing the 86 million euros maximum value of Frenkie de Jong’s move from Ajax to Barcelona three years ago.
Antony has scored 31 goals in 134 club appearances for Ajax and Sao Paulo, and two goals in nine senior appearances for Brazil.
By moving to Old Trafford, the 22-year-old will be reunited with former Ajax manager Erik ten Hag, who has already brought defender Lisandro Martinez to United from the Dutch giants.
“Since February of this year, my agents came to Amsterdam to inform Ajax of my desire to leave the club to face a new challenge and that some interested clubs would arrive and, with them, certainly a great offer,” Antony said via Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano on YouTube over the weekend, as he made clear his intention to leave the side.
“During the window months, meetings concluded including a proposal from Ajax for a contract renewal. I made it clear once again I want to leave the club.
“Today in a meeting with the board I expressed my interest in leaving the club, this time with a considerable offer on the table. Others have already arrived (but) Ajax always refuses with the argument it only has five days to replace (me).
“I’m not asking (for Ajax) to release me, I am asking Ajax to sell me for the highest bid received for a player who plays in the Eredivisie.” Antony added:  “I was very happy in Amsterdam. I won titles at Ajax, made friends and built part of my career, but now I reinforce that I am ready and full of motivation to follow my story and my dreams...Ajax will always be in my heart.” 
The transfer window closes on Thursday evening, when United will be in Leicester seeking a third successive Premier League victory. It is unlikely Antony will be involved against the Foxes, currently bottom of the table.

Sarfraz’s knock of 42 off 32 balls was the exact difference between Sindh and Southern Punjab in the first match of the day before Shan’s 36-ball 54 proved just enough for Balochistan to edge Central Punjab.
Balochistan, however, survived a scare that came in the form of all-rounder Irfan Khan Niazi’s blistering 31-ball 57 (three fours and three sixes) that brought Central Punjab in touching distance of the 187-run target. 
Irfan walked in to bat with Central Punjab needing 127 off just 64 balls after the likes of veteran opener Ahmed Shehzad (17) and Pakistan Test mainstay Abdullah Shafique (15) departed early. 
The right-hander, a product of Pakistan Cricket Board’s age-group programme, then combined for 61 runs with Tayyab Tahir (51 off 33) and added 41 with Pakistan all-rounder Faheem Ashraf. 
Irfan and Tayyab — who hit seven fours and a six — accelerated at the rate of 9.38 runs per over during their partnership before the former and Faheem raised it to 15 runs per over. Central Punjab required 19 off the last over and narrowly missed with a boundary needed off the last ball. 
Earlier, Shan and Abdul Wahid Bangalzai (54, three fours and four sixes) helped Balochistan post the towering total after their captain Yasir Shah won the toss and elected to bat. 
Shan and Wahid combined to score 111 runs, smashing 13 boundaries between them after coming together in the fourth over with 36 on the board following Haseebullah and Asad Shafiq’s dismissals on consecutive deliveries. Shan hit six fours in his 36-ball stay. 
Ahmed Daniyal took all four of Balochistan’s wickets. 
Earlier in the tournament opener, Sarfraz’s 32-ball knock and a dominant bowling show by Sindh gave them a comprehensive win. 
Southern Punjab opted to chase after winning the toss and kept Sindh’s scoring rate in check with wickets at regular intervals as Sindh exhausted all their batters and managed 147 all out with two balls remaining. 
Openers Sharjeel Khan (24 off 19) and Saim Ayub (30 off 20) added 38 runs together before the former was undone by leg-spinner Ali Majid. 
Sarfraz walked in the middle with three wickets down for 73 in the 10th over and cracked six fours, scoring at a strike rate of 131. The wicket-keeper/batter batted with the tail and was his side’s last wicket to fall when he was caught off Sameen Gul, who returned the innings’ best figures of three for 24. 
Pacer Mohammad Ilyas was the other bowler to bag three preys — Omair Bin Yousuf, Sohail Khan and Danish Aziz. Left-arm wrist spinner Faisal Akram returned two for 26. 
Southern Punjab were never really in the run chase and were bowled out for a paltry 105 in 16.4 overs.  
Right-arm pacer Sohail Khan finished with three wickets to his name. He removed Sameen Gul and Faisal Akram on successive deliveries. 
The only notable batting performance in the run chase came from Sharoon Siraj, who struck 36 off 27. 
Scores in brief:
BALOCHISTAN 186-4 in 20 overs (Shan Masood 54, Abdul Wahid Bangalzai 54; Ahmed Daniyal 4-28); CENTRAL PUNJAB 184-5 in 20 overs (Irfan Khan Niazi 57 not out, Tayyab Tahir 51; Amad Butt 3-29) 
SINDH 147 in 19.4 overs (Sarfaraz Ahmed 42, Saim Ayub 30; Sameen Gul 3-24, Mohammad Ilyas 3-29); SOUTHERN PUNJAB 105 in 16.4 overs (Sharoon Siraj 36; Sohail Khan 3-15; Zahid Mehmood 2-26).

The PCB had initially planned to sell six PJL teams as franchises to interested takers but the latest decision comes as a surprise with just a week to go until the tournament’s player’s draft, which is slated for Sept. 6.
““Instead of selling team rights, the PCB has made a strategic decision to take complete ownership of the inaugural edition,” PCB chief executive officer Faisal Hasnain said in a news release. 
“This gives us the chance to present to the world and to all our valued commercial partners that this is an event that has high value, context and is here to stay.”
Faisal said the PCB still awaited the “sale of other commercial inventory” of the U-19 T20 tournament, which is scheduled to be held here in October.
“While the process for the sale of other commercial inventory is ongoing and we remain confident of attracting high-quality sponsors,” he was quoted as saying.
“I want to thank all the investors who expressed their interest in procuring team naming rights. 
“We will continue the discussions with them after the completion of the tournament, with a future aim of building a long-term relationship.”
Meanwhile, the PCB also revealed the names of the six outfits; Bahawalpur, Gujranwala, Gwadar, Hyderabad, Mardan and Rawalpindi — and their “mentors”, the names of whom have been announced earlier.
Ex South Africa leg-spinner Imran Tahir will mentor Bahawalpur while former Pakistan skipper Shoaib Malik will join the Gujranwala outfit. Gwadar will be mentored by West Indies legend Sir Vivian Richards and his compatriot Darren Sammy will assist the Hyderabad side.
Another former national skipper Shahid Afridi has been given the Mardan assignment while New Zealander Colin Munro will help the Rawalpindi players.
Pakistan’s legendary batsman Javed Miandad will be the “roving umbrella mentor, helping and assisting all the sides,” said the PCB statement.
As many as 140 foreign players have registered for the PJL draft.

The struggling south-coast club are fourth from bottom of the standings with three points from four games.
“I would like to place on record my gratitude to Scott and his team for their efforts during their time with us,” the club’s owner, Maxim Demin, said in statement.
“However, in order for us to keep progressing as a team and a club as a whole, it is unconditional that we are aligned in our strategy to run the club sustainably.”  Bournemouth said their search for a new manager would begin immediately and first team coach Gary O’Neil would take over in the interim. They host Wolverhampton Wanderers on Wednesday.
Demin’s comments appear to be a response to Parker’s post-match interview at Anfield after their Premier League record-equalling defeat.
Parker said he was  “not surprised” at the result and that he needed some new signings to strengthen his side, who finished runners-up in the second-tier Championship last season.
“It doesn’t surprise me. This is currently where it is at this moment in time. The players need help. Today proved too big a challenge. The levels were far too big,” the 41-year-old said after Saturday’s defeat.
“We’ve got a decision to make as a club. There will be days like this. Time will tell. It’s a huge disappointment, a real humbling experience.
“We have some days where hopefully we can get some help in and support and help the current team, who came up from the Championship,” he added.

10,British Open champion Smith joins LIV Golf,LONDON: British Open champion Cameron Smith has become the latest leading player to sign up to the breakaway LIV ...,"LONDON: British Open champion Cameron Smith has become the latest leading player to sign up to the breakaway LIV Golf Series which on Tuesday announced that he was in the field for its next event.
The Australian was one of six new recruits for the Saudi-backed tour for the LIV Golf Invitational Boston, from Sept 2-4.
As the world’s number two, the 29-year-old Smith will become the highest-ranked player to compete in a LIV Golf event.
Smith was linked repeatedly to LIV Golf shortly after winning the 150th British Open, at St Andrews, last month, but avoided discussion of the subject while playing in this month’s PGA FedEx Cup playoffs.
A LIV statement issued Tuesday said Smith would be among five other players making their debuts among a field of 98 at the International in Massachusetts including compatriot Marc Leishman, leading Chilean golfer Joaquin Niemann, Harold Varner III (world no 46), Cameron Tringale (55) and India’s top-ranked pro Anirban Lahiri (92).
LIV Golf’s record $25 million purses and 54-hole format have attracted several big-name players, including Phil Mickelson, Bryson DeChambeau, Brooks Koepka, Sergio Garcia, Henrik Stenson, Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter, Patrick Reed and Dustin Johnson.
But its creation has sparked a bitter split with the established US PGA tour and a flurry of lawsuits.
Four-time major champion Rory McIlroy, has been one of LIV Golf’s most outspoken critics among players.
And the 33-year-old from Northern Ireland rammed home his point on Sunday after winning the 18 million top prize in the season-ending PGA Tour Championship at East Lake in Atlanta.
“It means an awful lot,” McIlroy said.  “This is an incredibly proud moment for me but it should also be an incredibly proud moment for the PGA Tour. They have had some hard times this year but we’re getting through it.” 
LIV players have faced tough questions over Saudi Arabia’s human rights record and have been accused of greed in chasing the huge rewards on offer.
The likes of McIlroy have effectively suggested LIV events are not much more than exhibition golf, with no halfway cut and small fields taking part in 54-hole events rather than the traditional 72.
But last week PGA commissioner Jay Monahan said tour players had agreed to compete in 20 events next season, included 12  “elevated” stops with $20 million in prize money and minimum season pay amounts for fully exempt players.
England’s Lee Westwood, among those who jumped to LIV Golf for its record $25 million purses, told Golf Digest in an interview published Friday that he sees the PGA as trying to duplicate what LIV Golf has already done.
“I laugh at what the PGA Tour players have come up with,” Westwood told the magazine.  “It’s just a copy of what LIV is doing. There are a lot of hypocrites out there.
“They all say LIV is ‘not competitive.’ They all point at the no-cut aspect of LIV and the short fields. Now, funnily enough, they are proposing 20 events that look a lot like LIV.”

The announcement late Monday came on the eve of a two-day mission by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) to monitor Guinea’s progress on hosting the big event.
A decree by junta chief Colonel Mamady Doumbouya, read on state TV, declared the event an issue of  “national and priority interest.” All spending for organisational needs  “will be processed as a matter of urgency,” it said.
It also declared that land needed for the tournament will fall into the category of public interest, and any property transactions or work not related to the competition will be banned on these sites.
Hosting Africa’s biggest sporting event is a major challenge for the impoverished country, which lacks sporting infrastructure and transport.
Guinea was originally scheduled to stage the competition in 2023, but this was pushed back by two years when the list of organising nations was reshuffled in 2018.
The 2023 event will be hosted by Ivory Coast.

Atletico sit sixth in standings on six points, three behind leaders Real Madrid and Betis and one adrift of Barcelona, Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao.
Griezmann scored the winner in the 66th minute, assisted by fellow substitute Thomas Lemar.
Lemar made a fine individual run from the left touchline and found his France team-mate Griezmann on the edge of the area, who lashed in a shot that was deflected off the back of the defender and past the helpless goalkeeper.
With new signing Edinson Cavani sitting in the stands, Valencia were the better side during the first half and thought they had opened the scoring when 19-year-old American midfielder Yunus Musah netted a stunning long-range shot in the 24th minute.
But following a lengthy VAR review, the goal was ruled out due to a foul by Mouctar Diakhaby on Joao Felix in the build-up.
Just before halftime, Thierry Correia was initially shown a straight red-card for a foul on Atletico’s Alvaro Morata.
But referee Guillermo Cuadra switched it to a yellow after checking the VAR footage.
“What I don’t like is the lack of criteria. We never know when the referees will or will not use the VAR and that’s really frustrating,” frustrated Valencia manager Gennaro Gattuso told Movistar Plus.
After the break, Simeone brought on Griezmann and Lemar and Atletico took charge of the game.
“We didn’t have the game under control but we had many chances to score, three clear opportunities that were denied by their goalkeeper, who was instrumental to hold us to only one goal,” Simeone told Movistar Plus.
“We struggled get into rhythm, but Lemar and Griezmann came in and gave us more tranquility to impose our gameplan late in the match”.
Atletico will face Real Sociedad away on Saturday, while Valencia will host Getafe on Sunday.
