0,Islamabad to get two new healthcare centres after 37 years,"PM lays foundation stone of trauma centre in Pims, hospital in G-11","ISLAMABAD: After a gap of 37 years, two healthcare centres will be established in the federal capital as Prime Minister Imran Khan laid the foundation stone of a 200-bed Emergency and Trauma Centre at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) and a 300-bed hospital in G-11 on Monday.
Both buildings will be built by Chinese firms. The emergency centre will be completed in two years while the hospital will be constructed in 30 months.
Speaking to participants of the ground-breaking ceremony, Prime Minister Imran Khan said soon after taking charge of the government, he visited the Pims emergency centre.
“There are a number of departments that have been performing well but the emergency centre was in a very bad shape. Now a new emergency centre is being built and the design has been prepared by the same company that designed Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital. Overseas Pakistanis have paid for the design of the emergency centre,” PM Khan said.

PM lays foundation stone of trauma centre in Pims, hospital in G-11

“We want the emergency centre to have a specialised building for emergency patients. The other hospital, which will be called Jinnah Hospital in G-11, is being constructed after a long time. People should know that since 2010, the population of Islamabad has doubled,” he said, adding that the building’s architectural drawings are being prepared from the United States.
Speaking about the health card, Mr Khan said it was the biggest achievement of the government.
“Even in advanced countries, people have to pay premium for the card but we have provided the facility free-of-cost. Here, if a family member gets sick, the whole family goes below poverty line,” the prime minister said, adding that a month ago, Doctors Hospital performed a heart surgery of a labourer through health card.
He said a uniform education system was being enforced across the country so that the class system would be discouraged.
Talking about the hospital’s management, PM Khan suggested that the hospital’s affairs must be run in a transparent manner, the way it was done in private hospitals.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Health Dr Faisal Sultan said the first hospital was built in Islamabad in 1966 and the last one was constructed in 1985 when Pims was established.
“We have enormous pressure of patients on the health system of the city. The emergency gets the patient first and plays a major role in creating an impression of the hospital. Emergency will be an unprecedented centre. Moreover, the hospital in G-11 will also come as a relief for patients,” he said.
Talking to Dawn, Pims Director Dr Khalid Masood said the emergency centre would be constructed in two years while the hospital in G-11 would be constructed in 30 months.
The emergency centre building will have three floors and a parking plaza having a capacity for 400 vehicles. While sharing details about the Emergency and Trauma Centre, Dr Masood said the centre and parking plaza would be constructed on 6.5 acres.
“There will be four operating rooms or surgery centres, acute care centre, isolation rooms, pharmacy, Central Sterile Supply Department (CSSD), laundry, CT scan facility, waiting hall and environmental services,” Dr Masood said.

1,PML-N leader’s physical remand extended for two more days,RAWALPINDI: A court of civil judge on Monday extended the physical remand of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)...,"RAWALPINDI: A court of civil judge on Monday extended the physical remand of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Chaudhry Tanvir Khan for two more days.
Mr Khan was arrested by the Anti-Corruption Establishment Punjab in connection with a corruption case.
He had been remanded in police custody for seven days by the court of a senior civil judge on March 14. 
The PML-N leader, in a video talk which went viral on social media, alleged that the senior officials and investigating officers of ACE were demanding money from him to provide him relief.
On the last hearing, the civil judge had turned down the request of the accused in which he wanted the court to absolve him of corruption charges. 
The court, however, directed the investigating officer to take the PML-N leader to Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology (RIC) for necessary treatment as he was a heart patient.
Mr Khan was shifted to RIC under strict security where a doctors’ board suggested an angiography test. He had been in the RIC since then and was produced in the court on Monday. 
On the court directive, he was brought to the RIC on Monday in an armoured police van with chest pain, where senior medical staff conducted blood tests and Electrocardiogram (ECG).
According to sources Mr Khan was not willing to go through an angiography test at the RIC as he wanted to consult his own doctor about the procedure.
Chaudhry Tanvir Khan had been abroad due to illness and had come to Pakistan to attend his son’s wedding. 
He was arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) at the Jinnah Terminal in Karachi when he was trying to leave the country on March 11. His name had been placed on the watch list in connection with a corruption case registered by the ACE Punjab.
He was brought from Karachi by the ACE team headed by Zulfiqar Bazid, and shifted to Rawalpindi Cantt police station lock-up.

A murder case was also registered on the recommendation of the investigation team, Dawn has learnt.
According to a notification issued from the office of chief commissioner Islamabad, the SP was closed to central police office (CPO) with immediate effect until further orders. 
The team comprises SP investigation and city zone, assistant sub-divisional police officers of Sihala and Secretariat, SHOs of Aabpara and female police stations and an investigating officer, police said.
Mystery shrouds the death of the constable, sources said, adding the victim arrived at the house of the SP where her condition deteriorated. She was shifted to the hospital where she died.
Her death was kept hidden for hours, they said, adding the body was removed from the hospital to a seminary for last rites and later brought to the SP’s house from where arrangements were made to transport it to Karachi via flight.
The police got information from the hospital about her unnatural death and when it reached the SP’s house, it was about to be transported to the airport, the sources said.
According to the FIR, the initial autopsy report of the policewoman suggested that she was poisoned, it added.
Samples were taken from her body and sent to Lahore for forensic and chemical examination tests for detection of actual cause of death, the sources said, adding that the final autopsy report of the victims is awaited.
Investigation of the case depends on this final report, they said, adding if it was confirmed that she was poisoned then it would be investigated.
In the meantime, statements of the SP and other people related to the incident, including those who transported her to the hospital after her condition deteriorated will be recorded. Besides, collection of technical evidence is also in progress including geo-fencing, they said.
The SP was transferred to the CPO on the recommendation of an inquiry team, which raised suspicions over the events and the officer’s role and actions, the sources said, adding that he was removed from the office to ensure fair investigation.

3,CDA undecided over Wasa’s requests to install tubewells,"Wasa wants to set up 15 tubewells in Islamabad, a city which is already facing shortage of water.","
MNA from Rawalpindi writes letter, seeks permission to set up tubewells in Islamabad  
Civic body’s spokesman says decision to be taken in view of capital’s needs

ISLAMABAD: Emboldened by the support of Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed’s nephew, the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) has asked the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to allow it to install tubewells in the federal capital’s jurisdiction for the citizens of Rawalpindi.
The garrison city’s civic agency has the support of member of National Assembly (MNA) Sheikh Rashid Shafique who wrote a letter to the CDA, asking it to permit Wasa to install tubewells within its limit to meet the water needs of the residents of Rawalpindi.
Wasa wants to set up 15 tubewells in Islamabad, a city which is already facing shortage of water and its ground water level has been depleting drastically.
“Yes, we received an application from Wasa for installation of tubewells in Islamabad. But, we have not taken a decision, CDA spokesperson Syed Asif Raza said.
“We will take a decision while keeping in view our own needs first,” Mr Raza said.
According to CDA sources, though a final decision was yet to be taken, capital’s civic body’s water directorate and planning wing had raised objections, saying that Islamabad was already facing acute water shortage.
The CDA is an attached department of the interior ministry, which is headed by Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, who was elected from Rawalpindi’s NA-62 constituency. His nephew, Sheikh Rashid Shafique, is also a member of parliament,having returned from the garrison city’s NA-60 constituency.
The sources said CDA received Mr Shafique’s letter in December, but it has still not closed the file.
They said earlier in 2015-16, the CDA had allowed installations of 23 tubewells of Wasa in Islamabad’s limits along the service road west of expressway only to rue later on as the capital’s water table is rapidly depleting.
The CDA officials said massive growth in the city, increase in population as well as the fast depleting water table had put the civic agency in a difficult position.
In the letter dated Dec 24, 2021, Sheikh Rashid Shafique said: “With reference to the letter mentioned above, it is stated that the subject matter is urgent in nature and site plan showing the locations has already been sent to the town planner of the Planning Wing CDA Islamabad.”
“Furthermore, a part of the funds is also being released to initiate the project immediately,” Mr Shafique said, requesting the CDA to issue a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) for the project.
In order to improve the water table last year, the CDA inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) to enhance water table by constructing 150 recharging wells for storing rainwater.
During the last few decades, the civic agency could not add water to the system from any new source apart from the two million gallons of water from Rawal Dam which it restored after over two decades.
At present, the CDA is supplying 60 to 70 mgd from three main sources – Simly Dam, Khanpur Dam and tubewells –whereas the actual need as per its own study is 220mgd. Rawalpindi, too, is in the grip of water shortage.
The twin cities have pinned hopes on the proposed mega Ghazi Barotha project, which once completed, will provide 100 mgd each to both Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
In 2018, the then minister of state for interior, Shehryar Afridi, in response to a written reply, had told the Senate that the capital’s groundwater level had fallen by five times in the last five years.
He said 6ft decrease in groundwater level was observed in 2013, a 10ft reduction in 2014 and 16ft, 23ft and 30ft decrease up till 2017. He said the groundwater level was falling in Islamabad due to extensive pumping by departments and residents to meet water requirements and due to below normal rainfall.

He was speaking to participants of a public meeting held on the occasion of the ground-breaking ceremony of two sports facilities in Pindigheb.

Col Anwar says Attock to have five sports facilities for youth

He said those who kept an eye on the politics of the country knew that the popularity of the prime minister had increased in the last two weeks.
People support a brave and selfless leader who stands firm in front of the world and can present the position of the country, Mr Khan said, adding that the prime minister did not do politics to win elections only and spoke for the independence and self-determination of the country.
About the projects earmarked for Attock, the minister said five mega sports facilities would be established in the district during the current fiscal year for promotion of sports and provision of better recreational facilities to the youth.
These facilities include the Tehsil Sports Complex that has been allocated Rs110 million in Shahbazpur and construction of a football ground in Pindigheb town at a cost of Rs37 million. These projects would be completed during the next fiscal year with a special grant from the provincial government.
Mr Khan said the government was pursuing a comprehensive programme for promotion of sports which was why grounds were being built all over the province, adding that millions of rupees had already been spent on renovation of a hockey stadium in the city that would help promote the national game at the district level.

6,OIC meeting to help solve Muslim world’s issues: AJK leader,MUZAFFARABAD: Former prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and supreme head of Muslim Conference Sardar...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Former prime minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and supreme head of Muslim Conference Sardar Attique Ahmed Khan has hailed the OIC foreign ministers’ conference which could go a long way in solving a number of issues facing Ummah.
In a statement on Monday, he called upon the world community to share the OIC concerns about resolving the oldest UN-listed unsettled disputes of Kashmir and Palestine.
“Despite being the oldest, these two issues are no less critical than the new issues like Ukraine in today’s world,” he said.
Mr Khan said people of Jammu and Kashmir were ever grateful to the august organization of OIC for lending principled support to the Kashmir dispute through its numerous declarations and statements.
“Our Kashmir stand is very clear; we want implementation of UN Security Council’s resolutions for peaceful Kashmir settlement. Our struggle is pivoted on restitution of our birth right to determine our political destiny which is enshrined in the UN charter,” he said.
He maintained that the OIC forum was fully competent to address and resolve the strategic and global issues in partnership with the world community.
The former AJK premier expressed the hope that during their two days deliberations in Islamabad, the OIC foreign ministers would focus on the latest colonisation campaign by India in occupied Jammu and Kashmir in violation of UN resolutions which opposed any unilateral geographic and demographic changes in a region listed by the UN as disputed areas.
Meanwhile, Khawaja Farooq Ahmed, a senior PTI leader and member of the AJK cabinet, has chided the opposition for intentionally trying to undermine the significance of the OIC foreign ministers’ meet in Islamabad as a result of “Prime Minister Imran Khan’s exceptional diplomacy.”
“The conference is being held at a time when the conspiracies of imperialistic powers against Pakistan are at their peak. What’s more painful is the willful contribution of the opposition to such intrigues,” said Mr Ahmed, who holds the portfolio of local government and rural development.
He asserted that PM Khan had adopted an independent and effective foreign policy, which had subsequently given Pakistan a prominent place in the comity of nations.
Mr Ahmed also welcomed the UN resolution against Islamophobia “as a result of consistent efforts by PM Khan” and said it reflected the sentiments of every single Muslim around the globe.

9,Asad Umar made amicus to examine MNA Kanwal Shauzab’s rhetoric against judiciary,"“Was it justified that the lawmaker started a campaign against the court,” asks IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah.","ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday appointed Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar as an amicus to examine the anti-judiciary rhetoric of PTI Member National Assembly (MNA) Kanwal Shauzab and Federal Investigation Agency’s high handedness over the registration of a first information report (FIR) against her neighbours under the controversial Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah took up the case pertaining to the registration of the FIR. The court observed that notices could not be served to the federal government since the petitioner did not deposit the mandatory processing fee.
Deputy Attorney General Syed Mohammad Tayyab told the court that he would receive the notice by hand and sought two weeks time to submit a written response in this matter.
Justice Minallah remarked that despite the fact that the IHC had issued a favourable order for the lawmaker, she started a campaign against the judiciary.
Mohammad Azhar Siddique, counsel for Ms Shauzab suggested that the court would declare the proceeding as in-camera and would prohibit its coverage in mainstream and social media.
Justice Minallah did not agree with this suggestion calling it “unreasonable” for an elected representative to distort facts related to a sub judice matter.
He pointed out that the MNA lodged a complaint against her over 70-year-old neighbour and the FIA picked up this complaint out of over 95,000 pending applications.
It may be mentioned here that the lawmaker registered an FIR under Peca with the FIA as her neighbours uploaded a video on social media about environmental degradation in the area and they challenged the said FIR before the IHC.
“Was it justified that the lawmaker started a campaign against the court,” Justice Minallah remarked.
After last week’s hearing, the lawmaker not only severely criticised the IHC chief justice on social media but also used derogatory words against him.
Mr Siddique, on the other hand, termed this a fit case to regulate social media, saying that the Lahore High Court (LHC) had already ruled that civil and criminal defamation can be prosecuted separately.
Justice Minallah remarked that if the MNA has some genuine complaint against the court, the court would be ready to address her grievances; however, it will be done in the presence of Asad Umar and adjourned further proceeding for a fortnight.

10,"Legislators, policy-makers asked to amend job quota for differently-abled people",Study’s main focus was economic empowerment of women living with disabilities,"ISLAMABAD: To safeguard the right to employment for the differently-abled people, it has been suggested to legislators and policymakers that they amend the designated quota proportionate to their condition and gender and allocate budgetary resources so that workplaces are accessible to them.
Differently-abled people have all the capabilities to emerge as professional leaders on decision-making positions. Therefore, their representation should be made mandatory in parliament through reserved seats and the Election Act 2017 should be amended to ensure their inclusion in the political workforce.
Furthermore, legislators should make rights-based legislation and policies to make the workplace environment inclusive, accessible and conducive for them.
These are the findings of a report titled ‘Economic Development in the Legislations regarding Disability in Pakistan’, launched at a local hotel on Monday.

Study’s main focus was economic empowerment of women living with disabilities

The report has been prepared by the Potohar Mental Health Association (PMHA) with the support of the Canadian government through Global Affairs Canada.
It has been highlighted in the report that to attain equality and equity, legislators should pass laws to include differently-abled women in corporate and development sectors. The main focus of the study was economic empowerment of women living with disabilities and how they can enhance their capacity towards becoming a progressive citizen of Pakistan.
PMHA Chief Executive Zulqarnain Asghar emphasised that there was a need to allocate budgetary resources to include differently-abled people in the mainstream society.
“There is strong need to shift the approach from charity to rights based as without this, real change cannot be brought in the society at large. Workforce of Pakistan is incomplete without inclusion of women living with disabilities. There is need to increase the fiscal spaces for women living with disabilities for their economic empowerment,” he said.
Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Country Director Hashim Bilal said there was discussion on inclusion at every level but unfortunately there was no implementation due to which the society was still far behind in facilitating the differently-abled people.
Development Communications Network Executive Director Munir Ahmad recommended that it was the need of the hour that governmental and non-governmental organisations implement the job quota allocated for the differently-abled people.
Awaz CDS Pakistan Executive Director Ziaur Rehman highlighted that by excluding persons living with disabilities, Pakistan lost Rs1.2 billion monthly, which was a major damage to the economy. Overall, the problem lies with the society and the way its operates, he added.

At the same time, despite being one of the top consumers of groundwater, there were limited laws and policies related to exploitation of groundwater in Pakistan, according to global studies. It has also been pointed out that a large amount of groundwater is extracted from across Northern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh but this groundwater extraction is greater than the expected annual recharge from rainfall.
Another study has shown that for Islamabad, there was no comprehensive law on groundwater resource management, and lack of implementation of existing legal requirements and boring wells was rampant in the local government and areas that fall under the Capital Development Authority (CDA). Therefore, during periods of drought, water supply becomes unsustainable and may run out at a time when people need them most, the study by British Geological Survey (BGS) and WaterAid revealed.
The study revealed that in Pakistan, around 94 percent of pumped groundwater is used for irrigation, but it has led to overuse and deterioration of groundwater resources.
“Coupled with urbanisation and the impact of climate change, Pakistan is now on its way to becoming one of the most water stressed countries in the world,” it was mentioned in the study. 
While, WaterAid has said that despite a push from activists, the overall prioritisation of water legislation remains low across provinces and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). In a statement regarding WWD 2022 Wateraid has said that clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene are human rights. That is why we need to act now to protect climate vulnerable communities from the impact of climate change, it added.
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 also highlights importance of sustainable and safe water and sanitation for everyone by 2030. It has been suggested that governments need to increase water and sanitation financing for marginalised communities, mitigate the risks to groundwater supplies such as pollution or unregulated extraction through stricter regulation and its monitoring to avoid overuse.
The study by BGS and WaterAid has asked Pakistan to use groundwater data and local expertise to develop comprehensive water programmes that can best serve climate-vulnerable communities.

14,Potato export to China can bring $2bn: farmers,The farmers claim that this year potato production was bumper and it was estimated to be 6 to 7m tonne surplus.,"OKARA: Pakistan can earn about $2 billion through potato export to China as containers are available at cheaper rates to local exporters under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) while potato should also be exported to the markets of the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia.  
This was stated by Potato Growers Association (PGA) Pakistan president Mian Muhammad Siddique and vice president Chaudhry Maqsood Ahmad Jutt, also chairman Potato Research & Development Board, who were talking to Dawn. 
They said they were waiting for forwarding the proposal to the government but they are waiting for the last 1.5 years for a meeting with Adviser to Prime Minister on Commerce Razak Dawood who was too ‘busy’ to spare some time to formulate potato export policy. They claimed that suggestions had already been sent to the Agro Wing working under the Federal Ministry of Commerce.  
Mr Siddique and Mr Jutt said a five-year policy for potato export was to be made by a five-member committee formed at a webinar, presided over by Mr Dawood, but it didn’t happen. The participants in the webinar included the then federal commerce secretary, the director of the Potato Research Institute (PRI) Punjab, the patron-in-chief of the Vegetable Export Association (VEA) Pakistan and others. However, no meeting was convened since then and the current harvesting season of potato was also approaching its end.  
The farmers claimed that this year potato production was bumper and it was estimated to be 6 to 7m tonne surplus but it was still just six per cent of the Chinese annual consumption (6m tonne). They said China faced a shortage of table potato from February to May.  
On the other hand, 105-110kg sack rate had fallen to Rs1,000 to Rs1,300 and beside this, the growers had to bear average Rs500 labour per bag expenditures from field to market. At the start of harvesting season, the price was Rs3,000 per sack at fruit and vegetable markets of Okara and Dipalpur. Okara district contributes more than 22pc to total national potato produce.  
Both the farmers mentioned said 230,000 tonne potato had been exported by the private sector on its own but the export was reduced after the Ukraine crisis. However, Iraq is going to purchase potato from Pakistan and Russia is in dialogue to import potato.
