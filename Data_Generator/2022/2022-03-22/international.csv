0,Christie’s to auction Warhol portrait of Marilyn Monroe estimated at $200m,NEW YORK: Christie’s announced on Monday that it will sell Andy Warhol’s 1964  “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn”...,"NEW YORK: Christie’s announced on Monday that it will sell Andy Warhol’s 1964  “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” portrait of Marilyn Monroe for an estimated $200 million.
The auction house said it expects the painting to become the most expensive 20th century artwork when it goes up for auction in New York in May.
In a statement, Christie’s described the 40 inch (100 centimeter) by 40 inch silk-screen work as  “one of the rarest and most transcendent images in existence.” Alex Rotter, head of 20th and 21st century art at Christie’s, called the portrait  “the most significant 20th century painting to come to auction in a generation.” 
“Andy Warhol’s Marilyn is the absolute pinnacle of American Pop and the promise of the American Dream encapsulating optimism, fragility, celebrity and iconography all at once,” he said in a statement. Warhol first began creating silkscreens of Monroe following her death in August 1962.
The pop artist produced four known as the  “Shot Marilyns,” all equal in size with different colored backgrounds.
The  “Shot Sage Blue Marilyn” portrait has her with a pink face, ruby lips, yellow hair and blue eye shadow set against a sage-blue backdrop.
At an unveiling at Christie’s headquarters in Manhattan, Rotter said the portrait stood alongside Sandro Botticelli’s  “Birth of Venus”, Leonardo Da Vinci’s  “Mona Lisa” and Pablo Picasso’s  “Les Demoiselles d’Avignon as  “categorically one of the greatest paintings of all time.” Christie’s is selling the work on behalf of the Zurich-based Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation.

1,Khamenei signals support for nuke talks at critical stage,"""The essence of the issue is to run the country in such a way that sanctions cannot hit the country seriously,"" says Khamenei.","TEHRAN: Iran’s supreme leader on Monday signalled support for Tehran’s nuclear negotiations to secure sanctions relief, a rare reference to the still-halted talks as world powers near a diplomatic turning point.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei stressed the importance of Iranian economic self-sufficiency during a lengthy televised speech on the occasion of Nauroz, the Persian new year. But he quickly added: I do not say that you should not seek to lift the sanctions. Those who are trying and working in that field, there is no problem.
Khamenei, whose pronouncements are considered vital as he has the final say on all state matters in Iran, has remained largely silent on the negotiations to restore Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers. His vague but supportive comments signaled that Iranian negotiators retained political space and flexibility.
Former President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the nuclear accord in 2018. President Joe Biden promised to revive it. Painstaking talks in Vienna have dragged on for the past year. Iran, its economy strangled, has urged sanctions relief but sought to resist tough Western demands.
Negotiations nearly reached completion earlier this month before Moscow demanded that its trade with Iran be exempted from Western sanctions over Ukraine, throwing the process into disarray.
Negotiators have yet to reconvene in the Austrian capital, and it’s unclear exactly what hurdles lie ahead.
""The essence of the issue is to run the country in such a way that sanctions cannot hit the country seriously,"" Khamenei said, praising the hard-line government of President Ebrahim Raisi for boosting Iran’s trade with its neighbours and shipping Iranian crude abroad despite sanctions.
""There is another way for us to use oil revenues for the country’s infrastructure.” In his remarks, Khamenei also weighed in on Russia’s war in Ukraine echoing some of President Vladimir Putin’s talking points without ever mentioning Russia at all.
""You look at Ukraine, its president who was appointed by Western governments, what a sharp tone he now uses to address the West,"" Khamenei said, extolling Iran’s resistance to foreign interference and military development since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. ""The choice of our nation was not surrender to arrogance, it was resistance, it was maintaining independence.""
Iran generally considers Russia an ally and feels united with Putin’s anti-American and anti-Western stances.

2,Myanmar army committed genocide against Rohingya Muslims: US,Blinken says the attacks against Rohingya are “systematic” and evidence points to a clear intent to destroy the Muslim minority.,"WASHINGTON: The United States formally determined that Myanmar’s army committed genocide and crimes against humanity in its violence against the Rohingya minority, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday, warning that as long as the junta was in power nobody in the country would be safe. 
Announcing the decision, which was first reported by Reuters on Sunday, Blinken said the attacks against Rohingya were “widespread and systematic” and that evidence pointed to a clear intent to destroy the mainly Muslim minority. 
A clear statement by the United States saying genocide was committed could bolster efforts to hold the Myanmar generals accountable and help prevent further atrocities, activists and US officials believe. 
In his speech at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, the top American diplomat read out tragic and chilling accounts of victims, who had been shot in the head, raped and tortured. 
Myanmar’s armed forces launched a military operation in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 of the mainly Muslim Rohingya from their homes and into neighboring Bangladesh, where they recounted killings, mass rape and arson. In 2021, Myanmar’s military seized power in a coup. 
“Since the coup, we have seen the Burmese military use many of the same tactics. Only now the military is targeting anyone in Burma it sees as opposing or undermining its repressive rule,” Blinken said. 
“For those who did not realise it before the coup, the brutal violence unleashed by the military since February 2021 has made clear that no one in Burma will be safe from atrocities so long as it is in power,” he added. 
Days after US President Joe Biden took office, Myanmar generals led by Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing seized power on Feb 1, 2021, after complaining of fraud in a November 2020 general election won by democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi’s party. Election monitoring groups found no evidence of mass fraud.

3,"HK to lift flights ban on Pakistan, eight countries next month","HONG KONG: Hong Kong plans to relax some anti-Covid-19 measures next month, lifting a ban on flights from nine...","HONG KONG: Hong Kong plans to relax some anti-Covid-19 measures next month, lifting a ban on flights from nine countries, reducing quarantine and reopening schools, after a backlash from business and residents. 
The moves, announced on Monday by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, come as many countries shift to trying to living with the virus rather than trying to keep it out.
Residents in the Chinese-ruled territory have become increasingly frustrated with the stringent measures, many of which have been in place for over two years.
A ban on flights from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines and the United States will be lifted from April 1. 
“The flight ban is no longer timely and appropriate...it will bring huge disturbances to Hong Kong people who are stuck in these nine countries if we continue the ban,” Lam told a news briefing.
Hotel quarantine for Hong Kong residents arriving into the city could be cut to seven days from 14 if they tested negative, Lam said. She had previously said measures would be in place until April 20.
Schools would resume face to face classes from April 19 while public venues including sports facilities would also reopen from April 21, she said.
Hong Kong’s border has effectively been shut since 2020 with few flights able to land and hardly any passengers allowed to transit, isolating a city that had built a reputation as a global financial hub.
Hong Kong has registered the most deaths per million people globally in recent weeks more than 24 times that of rival Singapore - due to a large proportion of elderly who were unvaccinated as the highly transmissible Omicron variant ripped through care homes.
The densely-packed city has recorded more than a million infections since the pandemic started and about 6,000 deaths - most of them in the past month. Authorities reported 14,068 new cases on Monday and 223 deaths. 
As many as 4 million people, out of a population of 7.4 million, could be infected according to estimates from health experts as many residents have contracted the virus and isolated at home without notifying authorities.
Businesses and the city’s economy are reeling from widespread closures, while doctors say many residents are grappling with rising mental health issues, particularly among low-income families.
Lam’s policy turnaround came after her administration was scolded repeatedly by politicians, pro-Beijing media and on Chinese social media, just weeks before the city is due to hold an election on May 8 to choose who will lead the territory for the next five years. 
She declined to comment on whether she will run for a new term.
Exit strategy 
A plan to carry out mass coronavirus testing would be put on hold, Lam said, citing experts who said it was not a suitable time. Hong Kong needs to have a clear exit strategy rather than trying to completely eradicate the virus, experts said.
While the former British colony has officially stuck to the “dynamic zero” coronavirus policy, similar to mainland China, which seeks to curb all outbreaks, it has been shifting to mitigation strategies as deaths skyrocketed.
Lam said social distancing measures would be eased in phases starting April 21, allowing restaurant dining after 6pm with tables of four people from two currently.
Nightclubs, pubs and beaches would be allowed to open in the second phase while people would be allowed to exercise outdoors without a mask. Masks are currently compulsory everywhere outside the home.
Until this year, Hong Kong had been far more successful at controlling the coronavirus than many other cities its size, but the latest wave of infections swamped its world class medical system, morgues are overflowing and public confidence in the city government is at an all-time low.

4,"Russian court bans Instagram, Facebook as ‘extremist’",The move is part of sweeping efforts by Moscow to crack down on social media amid its military action in pro-Western Ukraine.,"MOSCOW: A Moscow court on Monday banned Facebook and Instagram as “extremist” organisations, after authorities accused US tech giant Meta of tolerating “Russophobia” during the conflict in Ukraine. 
The Tverskoi district court said it had agreed to a request from prosecutors for the two social media platforms to be banned for “carrying out extremist activities”, but that Meta’s WhatsApp messenger service would not be prohibited because it is not a public platform. 
The move is part of sweeping efforts by Moscow to crack down on social media amid its military action in pro-Western Ukraine. 
During Monday’s hearing, Russia’s FSB security service accused Meta of working against Moscow’s interests during the conflict. “The activities of the Meta organisation are directed against Russia and its armed forces,” FSB representative Igor Kovalevsky told the court, Russian news agencies reported. 
“We ask (the court) to ban Meta’s activities and oblige it to implement this ruling immediately,” he said. 
After President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine on February 24, authorities blocked access in Russia to Facebook and Instagram, as well as to Twitter. 
Meta had announced on March 10 that the platforms would allow statements like “death to Russian invaders” but not credible threats against civilians.

5,Nations vet climate solutions as world ‘sleepwalks’ to catastrophe,"""Climate impacts are costly, but we still have some time to close the window and get ahead of the worst of them,"" says expert.","PARIS: Nearly 200 nations gathered on Monday to grapple with a question that will outlive Covid-19 and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine: how does a world addicted to fossil fuels prevent carbon pollution from making Earth unliveable? 
A partial answer is set for April 4, in the form of a 3,000-page report from the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) due to be approved after two weeks of closed-door, virtual meetings that began on Monday.
The assessment will detail options for drawing down greenhouse gases and extracting them from the air, in an urgent effort to stop devastating warming.
“The problem is getting worse,” UN chief Antonio Guterres told a separate sustainability conference in London on Monday, adding that major economies are allowing carbon pollution to increase when drastic cuts are needed.
“We are sleepwalking to climate catastrophe.” Climate impacts  “are costly and mounting, but we still have some time to close the window and get ahead of the worst of them if we act now,” said Alden Meyer, a senior analyst at climate and energy think-tank E3G.
He said the upcoming IPCC report, the last in a three-part assessment of climate change,  “will supply the answers as to what we need if we’re serious about getting there.” In August 2021, the IPCC laid out the physical science and projected that Earth’s surface temperature will rise 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, perhaps within a decade.
A 1.5C cap on global warming — the aspirational goal of the 2015 Paris climate accord — has been embraced as a target by most of the world’s nations.
Barely 1.1C of warming so far has ushered in a crescendo of deadly extreme weather across the globe.
Recently renewed national carbon-cutting commitments, however, still put us on a catastrophic path toward 2.7C of warming by 2100.
‘Transformation’
Part two of the IPCC report — described by Guterres as an  “atlas of human suffering” — detailed past and future climate impacts and the limits of our ability to adapt.
Delaying climate action would severely reduce the chances of a  “liveable future,” it concluded.
Part three is about how to keep planet-warming gases out of the atmosphere, with chapters on the key sectors where rapid and deep change is needed: energy, transport, industry, agriculture, among others.
“We are talking about the large-scale transformation of all the major systems,” climate economist and co-author Celine Guivarch said.
The main focus is on weaning the global economy off fossil fuels and moving to low- or zero-carbon sources of energy, from solar and wind to nuclear, hydro and hydrogen. Helping that transition is the fact that renewable energy is now cheaper than energy generated by fossil fuels in many markets.

6,UN refugee chief deplores racism towards ‘refugees of colour’,UNITED NATIONS: The head of the UN refugee agency said on Monday that the world must speak up against the “ugly...,"UNITED NATIONS: The head of the UN refugee agency said on Monday that the world must speak up against the “ugly reality”; that persons of colour people fleeing Ukraine were facing violence and racial discrimination.
“We bore witness to the ugly reality that some black and brown (sic) people fleeing Ukraine – and other wars and conflicts around the world – have not received the same treatment as Ukrainian refugees,” UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said.
“They reported disturbing incidents of discrimination, violence, and racism.”
In a recent report, another world body, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said it was alarmed by “verified, credible reports of discrimination, violence and xenophobia against third country nationals attempting to flee the conflict in Ukraine.”
Saakshi Ijantkar, a fourth-year medical student from India, shared her ordeal with CNN via a phone call from Lviv, western Ukraine.
“They were very cruel. There was no reason for them to beat us with this cruelty,” Ms. Ijantkar said. “I saw an Egyptian man being pushed by one guard… with so much force (that) the man hit the fence, which was covered in spikes, and lost consciousness.”
Mr Grandi said such acts of discrimination were unacceptable, and the UN agency was “using our many channels and resources to make sure that all people are protected equally.”
The UN official noted that all refugees suffer “the same pain and sorrow; the same loss and anguish” and they deserve “the same relief” given to the Ukrainian refugees. “Everyone on the run equally deserves our compassion, our empathy, and our support,” he added.
“We can — and must — salute solidarity, while also resolutely condemning acts of discrimination and bias”, Mr Grandi said.

Higher-than-average temperatures have again caused severe bleaching in parts of the reef, authorities confirmed last week, dashing hopes a cooler La Nina summer could spare corals from another season of heat damage.
Unesco’s mission will assess whether the Australian government is doing enough to address threats to the Great Barrier Reef, including climate change, before the World Heritage Committee considers listing it as  “in danger” in June.
Reef expert Scott Heron of James Cook University said he hoped  “there is some transparency in the areas of the reef [the UN team] are visiting”, including those affected by the current bleaching event.
“There are parts of the reef where the condition is so poor there is no opportunity for coral bleaching this year because there are few corals left,” he said.

8,Senators spar over first Black woman nominee for US Supreme Court,Biden describes Ketanji Brown Jackson as  “a brilliant legal mind with the utmost character and integrity.”,"WASHINGTON: Sena­tors launched marathon hearings on Monday on Ketanji Brown Jackson’s bid to be the first Black woman on America’s Supreme Court, with opposing sides sparring on her sentencing record as Republicans sought to frame her as soft on crime.
President Joe Biden’s pick to join the nation’s highest court was formally introduced at the start of televised hearings that will go on to include two days of questioning and a final day of testimony from outside witnesses.
Biden released a statement on social media just before Jackson’s arrival at the US Capitol complex, describing her as  “a brilliant legal mind with the utmost character and integrity.” 
A 51-year-old former federal public defender with almost a decade of experience as a judge on lower courts, Jackson previously served as a law clerk to Stephen Breyer, the retiring liberal justice she is being nominated to replace.
She is the first Black woman tapped for a seat on the court and would also be the only nominee of a Democratic president to be confirmed since Elena Kagan in 2010.
But while the historic significance is enormous, the prospects for major drama are low, with a green light from the Senate all but assured and the 6-3 conservative balance of the court not in play.
As the final word on all civil and criminal legal disputes, as well as guardian and interpreter of the Constitution, the Supreme Court seeks to ensure the American people equal justice under the law.
It is a check on the power wielded by the other branches of government and the arbiter of disputes covering all aspects of American life, from religious liberty and voting rights to gun ownership, abortion access and gay marriage.
Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar said in her address supporting the nomination that the court  “decides cases with life-changing consequences.” The Senate Judiciary Committee is meeting on Monday through Thursday to consider Jackson’s nomination, which is being conducted by a 50-50 chamber controlled by Democrats, meaning there is no room for missteps.
No red flags have been raised about Jackson’s record that would imperil her prospects, and Republicans have pledged to avoid the kind of  “character assassination” they argue Democrats staged before the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.
But conservatives have been signaling that they intend to go after her record as a public defender and raise rulings they say were too lenient in a bid to frame Biden — via his nominee — as soft on crime ahead of November’s midterm elections.
Staunch right-winger Josh Hawley has already suggested that Jackson has a pattern of  “letting child porn offenders off the hook” and added Monday that he intended to have a  “very candid” conversation with her about her sentencing history.

Shared concerns over Iran saw the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain forge ties with Israel in 2020 to create a new regional axis at a time of uncertainty over the commitment of key security ally, the United States.
Gulf states were excluded from talks to revive a 2015 nuclear pact with Iran that they have criticised for not addressing Tehran’s missile programme and regional proxies, including in Yemen.
Egypt’s presidency said Sisi and the UAE’s Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al Nahyan held expanded bilateral talks in the Red Sea Resort of Sharm el Sheikh.
Sisi stressed Egypt’s commitment to security in the Gulf and “rejection of any practices that seek to destabilise it”, the presidency said in a statement. There was no official comment on any talks involving Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett.

10,"Court told alleged killer of UK lawmaker David Amess was ‘ fanatical, radicalised terrorist'","Ali Harbi Ali allegedly wanted to kill parliamentarians for endorsing wars in Syria, Iraq.","LONDON: British lawmaker David Amess was  “assassinated” while meeting constituents last year by a  “fanatical, radicalised Islamist terrorist,” a court heard on Monday as his accused killer went on trial.
Veteran Conservative MP Amess was stabbed to death at a Methodist church in Leigh-on-Sea in southeast England in October.
Ali Harbi Ali, 26, from north London, was arrested at the scene and has pleaded not guilty to murder and to preparing acts of terrorism.
On the opening day of his trial at the Old Bailey court in central London, prosecutor Tom Little told jurors that Ali was undoubtedly responsible for the  “cold and calculated murder”.

Ali Harbi Ali allegedly wanted to kill parliamentarians for endorsing wars in Syria, Iraq

“This was nothing less than an assassination for terrorist purposes,” he said, noting it was  “carried out because of a warped and twisted and violent ideology.
“It was a murder carried out by that young man (Ali) who for many years had been planning just such an attack and who was, and is, a committed, fanatical, radicalised Islamist terrorist.”
Little said Ali had been determined to carry out a terror attack  “for a number of years”, and had bought the knife allegedly used to kill the lawmaker in 2016.
He had researched and planned potential attacks on the Houses of Parliament and other MPs, including targeting the higher profile senior minister Michael Gove, the prosecutor added.
The 26-year-old defendant appeared in the dock wearing a black robe and black-rimmed glasses.
The killing of Amess, the second of a British MP within five years, shocked the country and led to calls for better security for elected representatives.
In 2016, a right-wing extremist who shouted  “Britain first” shot and stabbed Labour MP Jo Cox to death in the febrile run-up to the Brexit referendum.
The Old Bailey jury was told that Ali had tricked his way into getting an appointment with Amess by claiming he was moving into the constituency.
The defendant had appeared  “relaxed and chatty” moments before he  “brutally” stabbed the MP in a  “vicious and frenzied attack” shortly after midday on October 15, Little said.
Afterwards, Ali waved the bloody knife around and said  “I killed him, I killed him” while threatening those present to stay away from him, he added.
“I want him dead. I want every parliament minister who signed up for the bombing of Syria, who agreed to the Iraqi war to die,” he allegedly added.

11,S. Arabia refuses to take blame for oil shortage,Gulf Arab oil producers have so far resisted pressure from the US administration to pump more crude to help bring down oil prices.,"DUBAI/WASHINGTON: Saudi Arabia said on Monday that it won’t bear any “responsibility” for a shortage in global oil supplies after a fierce barrage of attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels affected production in the kingdom, the world’s largest oil exporter.
The unusually stark warning marked a departure from the giant oil producer’s typically cautious statements, as Saudi officials remain aware that even their smallest comments can swing the price of oil and rattle global markets.
The state-run Saudi Press Agency quoted the Saudi Foreign Ministry as saying that the kingdom declares that it will not bear any responsibility for any shortage in oil supplies to global markets in light of the attacks on its oil facilities.
The announcement comes as the kingdom remains in lockstep with OPEC and other oil-producing countries in a deal limiting production increases
Gulf Arab oil producers have so far resisted pressure from the Biden administration to pump more crude to help bring down oil prices that have soared amid Russia’s war on Ukraine.
Already, gasoline prices have hit record highs around the world. Gas prices in the US topped $4.25 on Monday, according to auto club AAA, just below the historic record of $4.33 reached earlier this month.
The international community must assume its responsibility to preserve energy supplies,” the Saudi statement added, in order to deter attacks that jeopardize the kingdoms production capability and its ability to fulfill its commitments.”
The international oil benchmark Brent crude hovered over $112 a barrel in trading Monday, up more than 4pc for the preceding session. The price remained below a peak of nearly $140 hit earlier this month, but still some $15 a barrel more than before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Patriot missile supply
The  US has transferred a significant number of Patriot antimissile interceptors to Saudi Arabia in recent weeks as the Biden administration looks to ease what has been a point of tension in the increasingly complicated US-Saudi relationship.
A senior administration official confirmed Sunday night that the interceptors have been sent to  Saudi Arabia. The official said the decision was in line with President Joe Biden’s promise that America will have the backs of our friends in the region.
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday condemned Houthi forces in  Yemen after they unleashed one of their most intense barrages of drone and missile strikes on Saudi Arabia’s critical energy facilities,  sparking a fire at one site and temporarily cutting oil production at another.
The US had moved its own Patriot defence system from Prince Sultan Air Base outside of Riyadh even as the kingdom faced continued to face air attacks from Yemen's Houthi rebels.
The kingdom has insisted that the interceptors are critical to their defense against Houthi attacks.  The Saudis have been locked in a stalemate war with the Houthis since  March 2015.

He said Moscow wanted Ukraine to “hand over” Kharkiv, Mariupol and Kyiv, adding that neither the people of those cities “or me, as president, can do this”.
Ukrainian officials defiantly rejected a Russian demand that their forces in Mariupol lay down arms and raise white flags on Monday in exchange for safe passage out of the besieged strategic port city.
Ukrainian officials rejected the Russian proposal for safe passage out of Mariupol even before Russia’s 0200 GMT deadline for a response came and went.

Shopping mall bombed in Kyiv

""There can be no talk of any surrender, laying down of arms,” Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk told the news outlet Ukrainian Pravda. “We have already informed the Russian side about this. 
Russian Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev had offered two corridors one heading east toward Russia and the other west to other parts of Ukraine. He did not say what Russia planned to do if the offer was rejected.
The Russian Ministry of Defence said authorities in Mariupol could face a military tribunal if they sided with what it described as bandits, the Russian state news agency reported.
Meanwhile, people fleeing the besieged port of Mariupol say they are leaving behind a city that has been almost entirely destroyed by Russian bombardment and heavy fighting. 
Video captured by The Associated Press showed residents pushing carts and carrying bags of food and supplies along debris-ridden streets and passages. The siege has caused shortages of food, water and energy supplies, according to city officials who say at least 2,300 civilians have been killed thus far in Mariupol.
In Kyiv, shelling has devastated a shopping centre, leaving a flattened ruin still smouldering on Monday morning in the midst of high-rise towers.
Overnight shelling near the city centre left at least eight dead, emergency officials said. The force of the explosion shattered every window in the high-rise next door and twisted their metal frames.
A cluster of villages on Kyiv’s northwest edge is on the verge of humanitarian catastrophe, regional officials said Monday.
Bucha and other nearby villages have been all but cut off by Russian forces.
At the same time, authorities in Odessa have accused Russian forces of damaging civilian houses in a strike on the Black Sea port city on Monday.

13,Body composting takes root in US ‘green’ burial trend,"KENT: A woodpecker settled on a branch overhead as Cindy Armstrong stood near a grouping of trees, gazing at a patch...","KENT: A woodpecker settled on a branch overhead as Cindy Armstrong stood near a grouping of trees, gazing at a patch of soil that contained bits of her son’s composted remains.
Armstrong is one of a growing number of Americans embracing environmentally low-impact burials for their loved ones.
Armstrong recalled that her son Andrew insisted on the so-called  “terramation” process after the western state of Washington became the first in the United States to make the practice a legal alternative to cremation in 2019.
“I was mortified,” she said.  “Now that I’ve gone through the process, I’m all for this. I will be terramated.” The composted remains of Andrew, who died from cancer last year at age 36, have joined remains of dozens of others on a hillside in the town of Kent, in the Seattle area, set aside as their resting place.
Thousands of Americans choose  “green” burial — which eschews chemical embalming as well as materials like concrete or metal which come with climate-harming carbon footprints — each year.
“He wanted to give back to nature,” Armstrong said on a recent March morning, with trees and plants taking root in the verdant, wet hillside.
The land is owned by Return Home, a startup that has performed 40 terramations since launching in the neighbouring city of Auburn seven months ago.
“It’s like these people are teaching us to die better,” Return Home founder and chief Micah Truman said as he showed a warehouse-sized room with racks of metal containers referred to as  “vessels,” which hold remains during the 60-day, sealed decomposition process.
The space was brightly lit and upbeat music played. Loved ones who visit during those 60 days can pick songs celebrating the lives of those they have lost.
Bodies in vessels are not embalmed, and family members are invited to add flowers or compostable mementos to the straw and other natural ingredients used in the process.
The amount of organic material added to the vessels to help in the composting process is about triple the body weight of the human remains inside, resulting in hundreds of pounds of compost being produced. No enzymes are added, the company said.
Sensors tracking moisture, temperature and air flow synched with a computer to optimize conditions for decomposition.
Halfway through the process, bones are removed and ground into fine pieces before being put back in the vessel to finish composting. The result looks and feels like ordinary mulch.
Families can take as much or as little as they want, with the rest spread at  “The Woodland” in Kent. Local zoning rules restrict the land — which was once strewn with ruined cars, some scarred by bullets — from ever being built on.
Body composting is part of an eco-friendly funeral trend gaining momentum around the world, according to Green Burial Council president Edward Bixby.
“Basically, it’s going back to the earth as we came; dust to dust,” said Bixby, who opened his first Destination Destiny natural burial cemetery five years ago in New Jersey and has expanded to ten US states.
The council has more than 400 members, some outside the United States, according to Bixby. A single cremation, according to the Green Burial Council, burns about as much fuel as a full tank of a large sport utility vehicle.
