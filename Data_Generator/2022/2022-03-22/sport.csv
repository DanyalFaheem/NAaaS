Lashmanova won gold in London when she beat compatriot Olga Kaniskina, who was also later stripped of her silver medal for doping. Lashmanova then won gold at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, another medal she will now lose.
The AIU said the charges were based on Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) data as well as evidence provided by Richard McLaren, who led the invest­i­gations into state-sponsored doping by Russian athletes.
“Russian race walker Yelena Lashmanova has been banned for two years, starting 9 March 2021, for the use of prohibited substances, a violation of World Athletics anti-doping rules,” the AIU said in a statement.
“Lashmanova has accepted the sanction proposed by the AIU... She is set to lose gold medals from the women’s 20-km race walk event at the London 2012 Olympic Games and 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow.”
The AIU said her results between Feb 18, 2012 and Jan 3, 2014 had been disqualified.
Lashmanova was previously handed a two-year doping ban in 2014. She had been coached by Viktor Chegin, who was banned for life from athletics in 2016 over the Russian doping scandal.
Russia’s athletics federation was suspended by World Athletics in 2015 following a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report containing allegations of state-supported doping, which Moscow denied.

Days after their 3-0 European humiliation by Villarreal, Dusan Vlahovic set up one goal and scored another as Juve kept their push to recapture the Serie A title alive with a win which moves them one point behind champions Inter Milan who are third, with a game in hand. Leaders AC Milan have a three-point advantage on Napoli, with Juve seven points off top spot. 
In Rome, Tammy Abraham bagged a brace, scoring the opener within the first minute at the Stadio Olimpico. The England striker quickly added a second before Lorenzo Pellegrini’s stunning free-kick. Roma moved up to sixth at the expense of Lazio who slipped out of the European places. 
Atalanta jumped above Maurizio Sarri’s men into fifth with a 1-0 win over Bologna, as 18-year-old Moustapha Cisse came on as a substitute and scored a late winner on his debut. 
Two first-half mistakes gifted Francesco Caputo two goals as Venezia lost 2-0 in a relegation fight against Sampdoria. Venezia remained three points from safety while Sampdoria climbed seven points above the bottom three. 
Hellas Verona drew 1-1 at Empoli after striker Giovanni Simeone failed twice with the same penalty.

2,Barca stun Real at Bernabeu to end losing streak,The victory was their first against Real since 2019 and came in style like a few others Barca enjoyed with Messi in his prime.,"MADRID: Barcelona’s losing run against Real Madrid finally ended on Sunday as the Catalans enjoyed a stunning 4-0 win at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, a humiliation of their fiercest rivals suggesting they are primed to challenge again for La Liga next season. 
Barca kept their recent momentum going under coach Xavi Hernandez in the last Clasico of the season. The win ended Barcelona’s five-match losing streak to their rivals and maintained an outside chance of fighting for the title after a difficult start to their first season without Lionel Messi. 
The victory was their first against Real since 2019 and came in style like a few others Barca enjoyed with Messi in his prime. 
It was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who thrived this time, scoring twice to continue his great streak since being signed in the final minutes of the winter transfer window. Ronald Araujo and Ferran Torres added a goal each to give Barcelona their seventh win in the last eight matches in all competitions. 
“Of course we didn’t expect this scoreline, but we did everything we intended to do from the start,” Barca captain Sergio Busquets said. 
With Real sitting comfortably on top of the standings with 66 points, the Clasico was never likely to determine the fate of LaLiga’s title race. 
But pride was on the line and Xavi’s much improved Barca showed that their recent return to form was genuine. 
After their fifth consecutive league win, Barca are third in the standings on 54 points with a game in hand, three points behind second-placed Sevilla, who were held to a goalless draw by Real Sociedad. 
Questions will be asked about Carlo Ancelotti’s future, with Real, who badly missed the injured Karim Benzema, outplayed tactically and technically by Barca, who were faster, slicker and, perhaps most worryingly, could easily have won by more. 
“We played badly and I planned the game badly,” said Ancelotti. “I am sorry for the defeat and I am sad. But we have to keep it in perspective.” 
With Ousmane Dembele and Torres exposing Real’s defensive frailty on the flanks, Barca opened the scoring in the 29th minute with an Aubameyang header from a Dembele cross. 
Barca kept up the tempo against a disorganised and lifeless Real and extended their lead when defender Araujo headed in from a Dembele corner. 
Ancelotti tried to change the dynamic, making two substitutions during the break but Barca scored in the first minute of the second half with an angled shot from Torres after a backheel by Aubameyang. 
Five minutes later, former Manchester City forward Torres returned the favour, teeing up Aubameyang for his second goal. 
Barca had several opportunities to extend their lead, but Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois avoided any further humiliation. 
Fifth-placed Real Betis missed a chance to gain some ground after being held to a 0-0 draw at Celta Vigo. Manual Pellegrini’s team stayed four points behind Barca and fourth-placed Atletico Madrid, and two points ahead of Sociedad. 
Villarreal stayed three points behind Betis after a 1-0 loss at Cadiz, who are just outside the relegation zone. Mallorca stayed a point behind Cadiz after losing 1-0 at Espanyol for their sixth consecutive defeat.

Marius Wolf, who had scored the winner against Arminia Bielefeld last week, put the visitors in front after eight minutes but apart from an Erling Haaland shot that sailed narrowly wide, Dortmund showed little else in the first half. 
The Norwegian, the subject of intense transfer speculation, made his first start since suffering an injury in January, having come back as a substitute last week. 
Cologne were not rattled by Dortmund taking the lead and got a deserved equaliser through Sebastian Andersson in the 36th minute after Jannes Horn’s free kick was headed towards goal by Anthony Modeste. 
Dortmund showed few ideas of how to break down the resilient Cologne defence in the second half. They remain in second place on 57 points, with Bayern top on 63. 
Brazilian Paulinho came off the bench to score a late double as third-placed Bayer Leverkusen moved up to 48 after their 2-0 win at VfL Wolfsburg earlier while RB Leipzig are in fourth place, three points behind, following a goalless draw against Eintracht Frankfurt. 
Cologne, who have lost just once in their last five league games, are in seventh place on 40 points and in the running for a European spot.

PSG, on 65 points from 29 games, still lead second-placed Olympique de Marseille by 12 points after OM beat Nice 2-1 courtesy of an Arkadiusz Milik penalty on the stroke of halftime and a late goal by Cedric Bakambu. 
Nice moved down from third to fourth on 50 points, two behind Stade Rennais who demolished strugglers Metz 6-1 with a Serhou Guirassy hat trick. 
Strasbourg’s Champions League push stalled again after a fourth draw in five outings following a goalless stalemate at Lorient, while Olympique Lyonnais dropped points in the race for the European spots with a 0-0 draw at Reims. 
Angers beat Brest 1-0 to end a seven-match losing run and bottom club Bordeaux lost 2-0 at home to nine-man Montpellier. 
With Lionel Messi ruled out by a bout of flu, PSG showed close to nothing at the Louis II stadium 11 days after being knocked out of the Champions League last 16 by Real Madrid. Monaco climbed to seventh on 44 points. 
“They played well, congratulations to them. They’re a good team, a great club,” PSG striker Kylian Mbappe said. “The goal is to get the 10th French title. We can win 8-0, 9-0, people will talk about the Champions League. Whatever happens we must respect ourselves, if we have a little bit of self esteem. We also need to respect the fans.” 
Monaco captain Ben Yedder is now Ligue 1’s top scorer with 17 goals after his 25th-minute tap-in from a rebound, and an 84th-minute penalty. 
Ben Yedder also helped in the build-up for German striker Kevin Volland’s goal for Monaco, making it 2-0 on 68 minutes in what was the real turning point of the game as PSG began to chase. 
Mbappe and Neymar started for PSG and had a string of opportunities as the visitors enjoyed the lion’s share of possession but were largely toothless in attack.

7,Liverpool set up FA Cup semi-final with EPL rivals City,LONDON: Manchester City and Liverpool just can’t be kept apart this season.,"LONDON: Manchester City and Liverpool just can’t be kept apart this season. 
Engaged in yet another tight tussle for the Premier League title, the two rivals from northwest England must now squeeze an FA Cup semi-final meeting into their busy end-of-season schedules. 
Liverpool needed a late Diogo Jota strike to edge past second-tier Nottingham Forest 1-0 on Sunday and were paired with City in the draw for the last four. 
It means the top two teams in the country will clash in the league at City’s Etihad Stadium on April 10 — City currently lead Liverpool by one point in a fascinating title race — and then in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley Stadium on the weekend of April 16-17. 
In and around those games are a pair of Champions League quarter-final legs for each of them, with City taking on Spanish champions Atletico Madrid and Liverpool facing Benfica. 
It could be a make-or-break period of the season, with squad strength and player rotation proving key. 
The other FA Cup semi-final match will be a London derby bet­ween Chelsea and Crystal Palace. 
Forest had dumped out holders Leicester and Arsenal on their run to the last eight and could easily have caused another shock had the fine margins gone their way at the City Ground. 
But Liverpool’s improbable bid for a quadruple of trophies — having already captured the League Cup — remains on course thanks to Jota’s 78th-minute winner as he stretched to meet Kostas Tsimikas’ cross for his 19th goal of the season. 
SPURS BOLSTER TOP-FOUR BID 
In the Premier League, Harry Kane and Son Heung-min were at it again on Sunday. 
The most lethal attacking partnership in Premier League history combined for all three of Tottenham Hotspur’s goals in a 3-1 win over West Ham United in a big result in the race for Champions League qualification. 
Kane set up Son for the second and third goals at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, having already sent in the cross that West Ham defender Kurt Zouma turned into his own net under heavy pressure from Son. 
The win saw Tottenham climb above West Ham and Manchester United into fifth place three points behind fourth-place Arsenal, who have played one game less than their north London rivals.

9,Injured Fritz ends Nadal win streak to lift Indian Wells title,"“This is just one of those childhood dreams you just think would never come true,” says Fritz.","INDIAN WELL: Hours from playing in the biggest final of his young career, Taylor Fritz was in severe pain. The prospect of having to withdraw against Rafael Nadal nearly had him in tears. 
His coach urged him not to potentially risk damaging his sore ankle further. Fritz stubbornly refused to bow out. 
His faith in himself paid off. Fritz upset Nadal 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) on Sunday to win the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells and snap the 21-time major champion’s 20-match winning streak this year. 
“This is just one of those childhood dreams you just think would never come true,” said Fritz, who tweaked his ankle late in his semi-final win over Andrey Rublev and received treatment to numb his ankle. 
“I can’t even describe how ridiculous it is how I could play today. I have never experienced worse pain in my life before a match. 
“If I knew it was going to be that bad, I wouldn’t have come out here. I took a couple of change-of-direction steps and screamed and honestly I was trying to act tough because I had cameras on me. 
“We did a lot of work leading up to the match and I went through a rollercoaster of emotions before the match thinking there’s no way I could possibly play today.” 
Nadal had his own health issue. 
He came into the match bothered by painful breathing that he first experienced during an epic three-set semi-final battle with 18-year-old compatriot Carlos Alcaraz. 
He took two medical timeouts during the final. The first one came after he lost the first set. Nadal went inside with a trainer after tapping his upper left chest. He got treatment on court after falling behind 5-4 in the second set. 
“When I try to breathe, it’s painful and it’s very uncomfortable. It’s like a needle all the time inside. I get dizzy a little bit because it’s painful. It’s a kind of pain that limit me a lot,” said Nadal, who turns 36 in June. “The thing that worries me now, it’s about what’s going on there, what I have to do now to recover and how long going to take.” 
SWIATEK BLOWS AWAY SAKKARI 
In an error-filled women’s final, Poland’s Iga Swiatek blew away Greece’s Maria Sakkari 6-4, 6-1 and move up to number two in the world rankings behind Australian Ashleigh Barty. 
“Right now, it’s too surreal to describe it, honestly,” Swiatek said. “But for sure I want to go higher because I feel like getting the No. 1 is closer and closer. 
Sakkari will move from sixth to third, the rising Greek star’s highest ranking yet. 
Another windy day in the California desert made life miserable for both players, the gusts contributing to an uneven contest littered with nine breaks of serve. 
The 20-year-old Swiatek claimed six of those breaks including two in a one-sided second set, clinching a second consecutive WTA 1000 title with a thundering forehand winner.

10,F1 expects a great year after positive start to new era,MANAMA: Formula One managing director Ross Brawn predicted a great year ahead after declaring that the most radical...,"MANAMA: Formula One managing director Ross Brawn predicted a great year ahead after declaring that the most radical rules overhaul in decades had lived up to its promise in Sunday’s season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix.
The floodlit race around the Sakhir desert track saw a reshuffling of the top order with resurgent Ferrari setting the benchmark and once-dominant Mercedes struggling.
There was also a thrilling wheel-to-wheel battle for the lead between Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Red Bull’s world champion Max Verstappen.
The aim of the new rules, which feature redesigned cars with cleaner, sleeker aerodynamics and larger, 18-inch (45.7-cm) wheels, is to spice up the racing action by allowing drivers to follow closely behind each other.
Brawn said that on the evidence of the first race, they appeared to have delivered, with plenty of chopping and changing throughout the field.
“I can remember some pretty tedious first races,” the Briton told reporters after Leclerc led team-mate Carlos Sainz to Ferrari’s first season-opening one-two since 2010.  “We didn’t get that today. I’m pretty pleased.”
“I think when you watch the cars racing, you can see they can race.”
In addition to the design rules, Formula One has introduced a tighter, $140-million budget cap with that set to narrow to $135 million in 2023.
It also has a new governance structure in place that requires only a ‘super majority’ instead of unanimity to push through any last-minute changes, meaning any big breakthrough discovered by a team can be vetoed by rivals.
“No-one out there at the moment is going to be able to put another $100 million into a programme to solve their problems,” said Brawn.  “So no-ones going to pull away.
“I think there’s a lot of things that have come together that we can look forward to in a great year.”
Brawn warned against getting carried away by the successful debut of the new rules, however.
He said the 2022 cars were just a starting point and that work to make them even better at racing each other had to continue.
Formula One chief executive Stefano Domenicali agreed.
“We need to do the step-by-step but, for sure, the first signals are really encouraging,” said the Italian. “Formula One in this moment is undoubtedly in a great shape.”

11,"Shaheen’s early fireworks, Naseem’s late burst help Pakistan keep Australia in check","“If you bowl with pace you can get reverse swing on such slow wickets and that’s what exactly I did,” says Naseem.","LAHORE: The first Test at the Gaddafi Stadium in 13 years, the series decider of Australia’s historic tour of Pakistan, got off to an explosive start on Monday. 
In the third over, Pakistan’s pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi struck twice in three deliveries. Australia were stuttering at 8-2 with Shaheen sending back opener David Warner and Marnus Labuschagne. 
But Pakistan-born opener Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith stuck in for Australia, raising a 138-run partnership to haul them back in the contest. 
It was in the third session when Pakistan hit back, fast bowler Naseem Shah breaking the stand with the wicket of Smith (59) before off-spinner Sajid Khan ensured Khawaja fell nine runs short of his century. 
Naseem returned to bag another wicket — that of Travis Head — and Australia, who won the toss and opted to bat, ended the first day on 232-5 as bad light stopped play two overs before the scheduled close. 
“I will come back tomorrow and bowl better,” Naseem (2-36), clearly buoyed after dismissing Smith, told an online news conference. “Our first target is to dismiss Australia under 300.” 
The opening two Tests of Australia’s first series in Pakistan since 1998 ended in draws but Naseem was hopeful that Lahore would produce a result despite the pitch once again being slow and offering low bounce. 
“If you bowl with pace you can get reverse swing on such slow wickets and that’s what exactly I did,” added Naseem. “It’s quite hot and the bowlers do get frustrated in such conditions, but you have to keep yourself calm because you have to bowl for longer periods.” 
It was that patience that saw the 19-year-old Naseem eventually produce the breakthrough Pakistan wanted when he got Smith lbw. 
“Smith is a great player, no doubt,” said Naseem , who replaced all-rounder Faheem Ashraf in the playing XI. “His wicket has given me confidence, and I was trying to restrict his scoring and in that process got him out.” 
Khawaja, though, was still there after Smith walked off and added another 41 runs with Head (26) before he fell for 91 after hitting nine boundaries and a six. 
Trying to flick Sajid to mid-wicket, the 35-year-old only got a thick outside edge to slip where Pakistan skipper Babar Azam dived to his right to pouch a brilliant one-handed shin-high catch. 
Having batted for just under five-and-half hours, Khawaja later revealed he wasn’t feeling well and physically struggled on a hot day. 
“This wicket is probably one of the toughest to score runs on,” he said during a news conference. “It was tough scoring runs because I think there are cracks on the pitch. The one I got out, it’s like sometimes you miss it and sometimes you edge it. 
“I was really struggling from the start and got some medication off doctor in between the breaks, I wasn’t feeling well at all. I was just telling myself, ‘Keep going. Go as long as you can. Keep pushing through.’ I could easily have gone harder, played a big shot, got out for 20 or 30. I felt horrible today, so it was actually a win getting 90.” 
Head followed Khawaja six overs later when Naseem induced his outside edge which was snapped up by wicket-keeper Mohammad Rizwan but there were no more wickets for Pakistan as Cameron Green (20 not out) and Alex Carey (eight not out) held out till the close. 
Australia would be reasonably happy with how the day panned out especially after the start Shaheen (2-39) gave Pakistan as Lahore welcomed the return of Test cricket for the first time since the terrorist attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in 2009. 
Warner was struck on the pads by a delivery which seamed back into him and was trapped lbw for seven before Labuschagne fell for a duck when he got a faint edge that was taken by Rizwan. 
Pakistan, though, would rue a number of missed opportunities that could have seen them take an upper-hand. 
Two of those chances came off consecutive deliveries. Khawaja was on 12 when his edge off left-arm spinner Nauman Ali flew to Babar at slip but the Pakistan captain couldn’t get down in time. On the very next delivery, Smith — then on 19 — offered a straightforward return catch to Nauman but he failed to hold on. 
Smith would go on to add 30 more runs but fell short of completing 8,000 Test runs while Khawaja, who made 160 in the second Test in Karachi, missed out on a 12th Test ton. 
There was another missed chance later on when Sajid spilled a return catch off Head when he was on seven. But unlike Khawaja or Smith, Head didn’t last long.

12,Pakistan stun West Indies to end World Cup drought,"“This was desperately needed, we all wanted that win,” says Nida Dar.","HAMILTON: Pakistan ended an 18-match losing streak at Women’s Cricket World Cups with an eight-wicket win over the West Indies in Hamilton on Monday, blowing open the race for the semi-finals. 
In a rain-shortened match with innings of 20 overs, Pakistan bowled superbly — with off-spinner Nida Dar taking four wickets for 10 runs — to contain the West Indies’ potent batting line-up to 89-7 then overhauled the modest target with seven balls to spare. 
Opener Muneeba Ali was the pick of the Pakistan batters with 37 from 43 balls in her first innings at the tournament. While Pakistan captain Bismah Mahroof made 20 and Omaima Sohail 22 in an unbroken partnership of 33. 
It was their first win at the World Cup since the 2009 tournament in Australia, where they also beat the West Indies. 
“This was desperately needed, we all wanted that win,” said Nida. 
“This one goes to all the Pakistani fans who are watching and supporting us.”  
Pakistan remain out of the semi-finals reckoning with one win in five matches but the shock result will boost the West Indies’ rivals in a tight race for the final four. 
The West Indies can still make the semi-finals but need to beat South Africa and have results involving India and England go their way. 
“It’s a do-or-die situation now and we have to come out banging,” West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor said of her team’s match against South Africa on Thursday. 
Torrential rain fell for much of the day and deep pools of water collected on the outfield. The rain abated about an hour after the scheduled start at 2.00pm and the ground staff worked to dry the ground and to allow a 40-over match to begin by 7.00pm. 
The pitch had been covered and protected from the rain but it still was altered by the conditions; it gripped and turned and batting was difficult, made harder by a damp outfield that yielded boundaries reluctantly. 
The West Indies power-hitting game almost was neutralised by those conditions. Opener Deandra Dottin scored 27 from 35 balls with five fours before becoming Nida’s first victim. The remainder of the innings contained only five more boundaries. 
Dottin hit three fours in the third over, bowled by the medium pacer Diana Baig, and helped the West Indies to 19-0 at the end of the four-over play.  
But the West Indies momentum slowly ebbed as the Pakistan spinners bowled with accuracy, taking advantage of any turn. 
The West Indies lost wickets regularly — three wickets in consecutive balls in the 16th and 17th overs — and weren’t able to keep runs flowing. They were 38-2 after 15 overs and the team’s 50 came up in the 13th over. After 15 overs, they were 62-4 and the last five overs saw the addition of only 27 runs. 
The West Indies’ defense began promisingly when Hayley Matthews bowled a first over maiden. But from then on Pakistan were able to keep up a steady run rate with singles. There were no more maidens and Pakistan were able to take singles when batters hit to fielders inside the circle. 
There were only six boundaries in the innings. 
“We wanted that one badly,” Bismah said.  
“We know we have been doing well but we didn’t cross the line and win one.  
“Now we want to think ahead and move forward in our efforts.” 
Brief scores: 
WEST INDIES 89-7 in 20.0 overs (Dottin 27, Taylor 18; Nida 4-10); PAKISTAN 90-2 in 18.5 overs (Muneeba 37, Omaima 22; Selman 1-15).

But a singing Barmy Army in typically good voice could not quite inspire the visitors across the finish line as West Indies, needing 282 runs to win, finished on 135-5. 
Though England were the better team overall, the match will be best remembered for the remarkable batting performances by Brathwaite. 
After stoically occupying the crease for almost 12 hours in scoring 160 from 489 balls in the first innings, he was there at the bitter end on Sunday, unconquered on 56, having spent all but about one hour on the field over five long days. 
“The pitch at times with the harder ball was difficult, but I stuck to my plans, which was to play as straight and late as possible,” Brathwaite said. 
“I’ve put in a lot of work through the years and to do it at home for me is a pleasing feeling with my family here. I’m very happy and thankful.”  Joe Root acknowledged the performance of his counterpart. “Kraigg played brilliantly again,” said the England captain. 
Root faced up to the inevitable query over whether he took too long on the final morning to make the declaration. 
“It’s always a tricky one isn’t it because you’re always trying to weigh up the options,” he acknowledged. “We had to be mindful how small this ground is and how strong the wind was through the day to consider the prospects of someone really coming off could put us under pressure.”
