0,2017 census challenged in Peshawar High Court,Petitioner requests the court to declare the census illegal.,"PESHAWAR: A citizen has moved the Peshawar High Court against the 2017 census in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including tribal districts, insisting that majority of the residents were not present in the erstwhile Fata due to displacement and economic reasons.
In the petition, Mohammad Jawed Iqbal requested the court to declare illegal and without proper procedure the holding of the National Census, 2017, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in general and tribal districts in particular, saying the former Fata faced hostile situation due to war on terrorism launched by the security forces at that time with around 80 per cent of the local population of those areas had left their homes as displaced persons.
He said neither the conditions were conducive for a fair census in 2017 nor did the government take appropriate measures to reach a fair and just conclusion with regard to the counting of the residents in particular areas of the province.
The respondents in the petition filed through advocate Malik Mohammad Ajmal Khan were the Federation of Pakistan through secretary of the establishment division, Council of Common Interest chairman, secretaries of the planning and development and finance divisions, Pakistan Bureau of Statistics chairman, Geological Survey of Pakistan director general, KP chief secretary, and secretaries of the KP Board of Revenue, local government and finance departments.
The petitioner said the 2017 census had also become controversial due to its repeated rejection by the province of Sindh in the meetings of the CCI, a constitutional body.
He contended that in the absence of a fair census, the implementation of Articles 153 and 154 of the Constitution, which dealt with the CCI and its rules and procedures, was not possible and thus, leaving negative impact on the interest of the province.
The petitioner said according to the controversial census, the population of the settled districts of KP was 30.5 million and that of tribal districts five million taking the total population of the province to 35.5 million, which was 17 per cent of the total population of the country.
He requested the court to direct the planning and development ministry and Pakistan Bureau of Statistics to take into account the residents left for other parts of the country or overseas to earn a livelihood as well as the women female population through female staff as they usually were deprived due to local traditions.
The petitioner said the displacement factor of people due to war on terrorism or economic reasons should also be considered.
He contended that the census had direct impact on Article 51 of the Constitution, which provided for the number of seats of a province in the National Assembly on the basis of population, and on Article 160 dealing with the National Finance Commission.

Awami National Party member Khushdil Khan advocate, who moved the question, asked Speaker Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani to refer the question to the relevant standing committee of the house to investigate the issue as well as payments to watchers.
Environment minister Syed Ishtiaq Urmer was absent prompting the chair to defer the question.
Responding to another question moved by ANP MPA Sardar Hussain Babak, law minister Fazal Shakoor Khan said the excise, taxation and narcotics control department had seized 612 vehicles under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Road Checking, Seizure and Disposal of Motor Vehicles) Rules, 2015.
He added that over 17 seized vehicles were handed over to their owners through the relevant police stations.
“The vehicles were seized over bogus and tampered registration, stolen vehicles, use for drug smuggling and terrorism, and fake superdari documents,” he said.
The minister said four of the other seized vehicles had been handed over to the Pakistan Baitul Mal, 69 to the customs department, nine to the administration department and 53 vehicles to other departments, while 22 were kept in the warehouse, 112 were given back to their owners after verification and 199 were in the custody of the department.
Mr Babak said the department did not provide details of the those given seized vehicles through ‘superdari’.
The chair referred the question to the house’s relevant committee.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Regularisation of Services in Erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas Bill, 2022, was to regularise project employees.
Chief Minister Mahmood Khan also attended the session after several months’ absence.
Last time, he had showed up in June last year when the budget was presented.

The assembly also passed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Service Commission Bill and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substances (Amendment) Bill, 2022.
The government introduced the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Infrastructure Development Cess Bill, 2022.
The lawmakers held a debate on an adjournment motion regarding air pollution in Peshawar, especially high concentration of particulate matter (PM 2.5), which crossed permissible limits. Pakistan Peoples Party member Nighat Yasmin Orakzai had moved the motion.
On the motion, PPP lawmaker Ahmad Kareem Kundi said the province had more forest covered areas compared to other province, which played a major role in addressing the climate change issue.
He said the provincial government should make efforts to include forest as the fifth indicator in the ‘weightage’ of the National Finance Commission Award as happened in India.
Shagufta Malik of the ANP expressed concern about vehicular and industrial emissions in the provincial capital and said there was no check on unfit vehicles that released carbon dioxide, which polluted the air.
She said the industrial units, especially chipboard manufacturing ones located adjacent to Hayatabad Township, also caused toxic emissions in the air, so the residents had been lodging complaints against factory owners.
The lawmaker said increase in hazardous substances in the air of Peshawar was creating serious health issues for the residents of Hayatabad but the environment department didn’t act against polluters.
She said officials of the environment department were not taking action against industrial units, which caused severe air pollution.
Earlier, the ANP lawmakers through a point of order condemned the police raid on musical concert in Peshawar in which Pashto singer Dr Karan Khan performed.
Terming the artist ‘ambassador of peace in the region’, they termed the police action an attack on Pakhtun culture and demanded of the government to hold inquiry into it.
The sitting was adjourned until Tuesday (today) due to a lack of quorum.
