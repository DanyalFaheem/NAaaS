• CJP says members have right to vote as party representatives
• Tells parties to fight political battles in parliament
• Refuses to allow rallies at D-Chowk; reminds political parties to ‘stay polite’
ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial has emphasised that members of the National Assembly have every right as an “individual constituent of a political party” to vote on no-trust motions without any restriction and coercion, but at the same time, public interest must not suffer by bringing everything to a halt — either economically or socially.
The parliament, being the central institution, must function in accordance with the Constitution, Justice Bandial observed on Monday, heading a two-judge Supreme Court bench that had taken up a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA).
The courtroom was filled with politicians on Monday, including Leader of the Opposition in the National Assem­bly Shehbaz Sharif, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, PDM leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Leader of the Opposition in Senate Yousuf Raza Gilani, Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry and others.
The petition seeks a restraining order against the government’s “stated intention” to prevent lawmakers from taking part in the no-trust proceedings against the premier and the presidential reference on the interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution.
The court said it would constitute a larger bench to hear the SBCA plea, along with the presidential reference filed by the government, on March 24.
When SCBA lawyer Mansoor Usman Awan invited the court’s attention towards the alleged violation of the law committed by NA Speaker Asad Qaiser by calling the assembly session on March 25 instead of March 22, CJP Bandial observed that the court would not like to go into procedural aspects, as it was only concerned that the constitutional right of vote by the parliamentarians should not be meddled with and advised lawmakers to “go and fight their case inside parliament if some wrong has been committed”.
Govt assurance
Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, meanwhile, assured the SC on behalf of the government that no lawmaker would be ‘physically obstructed’ in any manner from entering parliament on the day of vote. “I had a discussion with the prime minister and conveyed the displeasure of the apex court on the March 19 Sindh House breach by the PTI activists. The PM acknowledged that there should be no room for the mob rule,” he claimed.
However, Justice Munib Akhtar observed that the assurance should not be just for the first day, but for each day of the sessions.
At the hearing, the CJP also made it clear that the apex court would not allow any protest at D-Chowk.
About the reference filed by the government on Monday, the court said it would appreciate assistance from all political parties, including the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s allies, and issued notices to them to submit their replies to the reference in writing.
The chief justice also remarked that the court was sitting there not as the ‘adjudicator’ but as a ‘mediator’ between all the political parties to allow democracy to function.
Referring to the delay in the convening of the House for the vote of no confidence, the AGP explained there was a reason (i.e. the OIC meeting) for the delay and said the government had no intention, plan or desire to obstruct anyone as it wanted to see constitutional requirement being fulfilled strictly in accordance with the law.
Appropriate instructions, the AGP added, had also been conveyed to the administration that there should be no obstruction or any arrest of lawmakers though general public would not allowed to come close to the premises.
Unbecoming rhetoric
The CJP also had a word of caution for the political parties, stating that the rhetoric being employed these days ought not to be used. “We would like to close our eyes towards this, but there must be some dignity, courtesy and maturity and one should look at our earlier leaders and should follow their examples.”
Referring to Article 63-A of the Constitution, which deals with the defection clause, the AGP said lawmakers also had the right to abstain from the vote procedure, insisting that it was nobody’s business to compel any parliamentarian in the exercise of his conscience.
Referring to the presidential reference moved before the SC, he emphasised that the reference was “not a camouflage to seek delay” in the vote of no confidence. The government’s intention could be gauged from the fact that no interim relief had been sought from the government rather the question relates to post vote and it was up to the court to decide, he argued.
However, he also pointed out that the NA speaker was not bound by what he was saying since it was his personal view that the overlapping of the reference as well as the no-confidence motion would not obstruct the parliamentary proceedings.
During the hearing, the court also noted strong exception taken by Advocate General for Sindh Salman Talibbudin on the March 19 Sindh House incident. The bench observed that the SC expected “strong condemnation” on behalf of the government as the assurance held out was “not enough”.
Sindh House probe
Meanwhile, the apex court ordered Islamabad police to record the statement of the Sindh government in the FIR it intended to register about the breach of Sindh House.
Senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan, representing the PML-N, expressed the apprehensions that the district management might be under pressure for acting neutrally or impartially while deciding about the venue and route of the opposition rally.
Representing JUI-F, Senator Kamran Murtaza said the opposition should be allowed at a similar distance from the parliament as the PTI rally would be permitted.
Farooq H. Naek on behalf of the PPP expressed the possibility of a clash when opposite rallies would start converging at D-Chowk.
Ali Zafar, representing the PTI, assured the court that action would be taken against those responsible for the Sindh House incident and assured that court that the ruling party’s rally would remain peaceful.

1,Opposition berates NA speaker for ‘violating’ Constitution,Babar Awan terms Asad Qaiser’s decision in line with law; Maryam says fresh mandate only solution to resolve challenges.,"ISLAMABAD: Opposition leaders Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Monday slammed the National Assembly speaker for violating the constitutional provision requiring him to convene a meeting of the Lower House within 14 days after receiving a requisition for a session to table a no-trust motion against the prime minister.
Talking to reporters outside the Supreme Court, flanked by Balochistan National Party (BNP) chief Sardar Akhtar Mengal, the NA opposition leader claimed Speaker Asad Qaiser had deliberately violated Article 54(3) of the Constitution using the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) meeting as an excuse.
“He could have called the session earlier without waiting for the constitutional deadline to lapse,” he remarked. The speaker had, in fact, tried to trap the opposition by prodding it to take a stance against the OIC conference, he maintained.
The PML-N leader hoped the government will stand by the statement of the attorney general made earlier in the apex court. “The foreign ministers of Muslim countries are our brothers and will be warmly welcomed,” he remarked, adding the Pakistan Democratic Movement had postponed its long march because of the OIC meeting.

Babar Awan terms Qaiser’s decision in line with law; Maryam says fresh mandate only solution to resolve challenges

Speaking on the occasion, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman said the government was violating the Constitution and trying to evade the no-confidence motion. He advised Speaker Asad Qaiser to follow the Constitution and consult his lawyers before taking any action that might entail his trial under Article 6 of the Constitution (for high treason).
He said the government and the speaker had practically demonstrated that they could flout the Constitution. But he hoped the apex court would not take a political stance and stand by the Constitution, law and democracy.
PML-N Senator Azam Nazir Tarar, on the occasion, said the attorney general had assured during the proceedings that no MNA would be stopped from going to the Parliament House or barred from voting on the no-trust motion. He said the court had observed that Article 95 and Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of the Business in the National Assembly were very clear, and advised the speaker not to deviate from them.
Speaker’s defence
Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Dr Babar Awan defended the speaker’s decision to summon the session on March 25, which he said was in line with the Constitution.
Talking to reporters here, Mr Awan referred to Article 254 of the Constitution according to which when anything is required to be done within a particular period but is not, the carrying out of that act or thing does not become invalid or ineffective just because it was not done within the prescribed period.
Maryam’s presser
On the other hand, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz said a fresh mandate was the only solution to resolving the challenges facing the country.
Her remarks dispelled the impression that in case the no-confidence motion was successful, the incoming government would be a transitory, makeshift arrangement only.
Talking to the media after appearing in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in connection with her appeal against her conviction in the Avenfield apartments reference, Maryam said the opposition alliance may form a coalition government, but in order to bring the country out of the current fragile environment, sustainable development could only be achieved through early elections.
She said former premier Nawaz Sharif had, in a recent meeting of the PDM, suggested bringing all the forces into the mainstream to counter the political polarisation that had widened during the PTI regime.
She further said it was the desire of every Pakistani that the state institutions remained neutral, and rejected the PTI’s allegations that the no-confidence motion was linked to any internal or external conspiracy.
“He (PM Khan) knows that his party has been ruined. PTI MPAs and MNAs are worried about their political future as they have already lost the upcoming elections,” she said, adding “the game is over for Imran Khan”.
She laughed out at the government’s claims of assembling a million people in Islamabad for its public gathering, questioning “when they cannot retain 10 lawmakers how can they gather one million people”.
Ms Nawaz criticised PM Khan for using foul language against the opposition leaders and advised parental guidance for children when he appeared on television. She also requested the Supreme Court to restrain the PTI from flouting the constitutional provisions regarding voting on the no-confidence motion, and warned the ruling party of consequences for violating the law.
An IHC division bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani had resumed hearing of the said appeal on Monday.
However, since the newly appointed lead prosecutor of the National Accountability Bureau Imtiaz Siddiqui was not well-versed with the facts of the case, the bench advised him to get a thorough briefing from the deputy prosecutor general, who was the lead prosecutor in the accountability court and had appeared as prosecutor since the appeal was filed in August 2018.
Further hearing in the matter was adjourned till May 12.

2,Alvi moves SC to ‘end ‘defections forever’,ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Monday approached the Supreme Court to seek its opinion on the interpretation ...,"ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Monday approached the Supreme Court to seek its opinion on the interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution, wondering if Khiyanat (dishonesty) by way of defections warranted pre-emptive action by de-seating the member.
The reference, moved through Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan, would be taken up on March 24 by a larger bench of the apex court along with a petition of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) that sought a restraining order against the government’s “intentions” to prevent lawmakers from taking part in the no-trust proceedings against the premier.
The court said it would appreciate assistance from all political parties, including allies of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and issued notices to them, asking them to submit their replies to the reference in writing.
Through the reference, the government has suggested to the court that the most suitable and appropriate disqualification for a declared defector should be lifetime disqualification under Article 62(1)(f).
Moved under Article 186 of the Constitution, the reference asks how Article 63-A should be interpreted, adopted and implemented to achieve the constitutional objective of curbing the menace of defections and purification of the electoral process and democratic accountability.
The reference wondered if a member engaged in the constitutionally-prohibited and morally reprehensible act of defection could claim a vested right to have his vote counted and given equal weight or there existed a restriction to exclude such tainted votes from the vote count.
According to the reference, a member who could but did not hear the voice of his conscience by resigning from his existing seat in the assembly and has been finally declared to have committed defection after exhausting the procedure prescribed in Article 63-A, including appeal to the Supreme Court under Article 63-A(5), can no longer be treated to be sagacious, righteous, non-profligate, honest and ameen and therefore, stands disqualified for life.
The reference also asked the Supreme Court to advise what other measures and steps could be undertaken within the existing constitutional and legal framework to curb, deter and eradicate the cancerous practice of defection, floor crossing and vote buying.
The questions of law of public importance revolving around Article 63-A’s interpretation have arisen in the context of the unending malaise of floor crossing and defections that have sullied and damaged the purity of the democratic process in the country for decades, the reference stated. “As happened on many occasions in past, the stage is yet again set for switching of political loyalties for all sorts of illegal and mala fide considerations including vote buying which by its very nature rarely leave admissible or traceable evidence,” it pointed out.
Some of the presently defecting members had even “publicly admitted to defection” in interviews to the media with evident pride and further commitment to stay engaged in this immoral trade as the prima facie consequence was innocuous while gains in cash and kind may be colossal without any possibility of loss of membership of the parliament for life, the reference noted.
A truly democratic polity would forever remain an unfilled distant dream and ambition unless this menace was timely and forcefully rooted out, it argued.
The constitutional objective of eradicating the cancer of defection and horse-trading could be redeemed by a robust and purposive interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution, particularly Articles 17, 62 and 63-A, according to the presidential reference.
Being the backbone in a parliamentary form of government, political parties were ultimately accountable to the people through elections in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, it argued, adding that the voters evaluated candidates on the basis of their party and rarely on individual credentials while choosing their representatives in the assemblies. Such cases were exceptional where independent candidates outvote all other candidates, including those contesting on party tickets, it pointed out.
The reference asked the court to answer all those questions of law so as to purify and strengthen the democratic process, worthy of people’s respect and trust, and forever eradicate the menace of defections.

3,"PM Imran suggests merit, not seniority, in govt appointments","Says the government system did not follow merit, resulting in “unbridled corruption” in the country.","ISLAMABAD: Claiming that his Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government has put the country on the track to sustainable growth, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday remarked that the heads of state institutions should be appointed on the basis of “merit” and not “seniority”.
“If a senior is not eligible to become a chief executive, the second-best should be made the head of the institution,” the prime minister said while addressing the groundbreaking of a 200-bed accident and emergency centre at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Science (Pims) and another 300-bed Jinnah Hospital in Sector G-11/3.
While urging the Pims Board of Directors to ensure meritocracy on the lines of the private sector, he said people should be inducted on merit — a point he has been stressing throughout his political career. “Under the prevailing government system, one reaches the top position on the basis of seniority,” he said, adding the time had come for institutions to adopt the system of the private sector.
The government system did not follow merit, he claimed, resulting in “unbridled corruption” in the country.
Recounting his government’s achievements, Prime Minister Khan claimed they had made remarkable improvements in public sector development, particularly health, education and economy. “No government in the past 70 years has ever taken steps for the welfare of the common man the way the PTI government has,” he added.
He then mentioned economic growth, “rising” national income, a uniform education system, the establishment of Rehmatul lil Alameen Authority and financial stability of the country.
PM meets Senate chairman, others
Later, Prime Minister Khan met Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani and many other legislators to ensure their support against the opposition’s no-confidence motion.
According to the PM Office, the prime minister said development of the Reko Diq gold and copper mine would play an important role in the social and economic uplift of Balochistan, and Pakistan in general.
The Senate chairman thanked the PM for striking a successful agreement with Barrick Gold Company for the development of gold and copper reserves in Reko Diq, and the waiver of a penalty worth $11 billion. Under the project, the company would invest $10bn in Balochistan, creating 8,000 jobs in the Reko Diq area.
Others who met the prime minister were MNAs Ghulam Bibi Bharwana, Aftab Siddiqui, Saifur Rehman, Attaullah, Akram Cheema, Fahim Khan, Aslam Khan, Alamgir Khan, Abdul Shakoor Shaad, retired Capt Kamil, Aftab Jehangir, Asma Nadeem, Nusrat Waheed, Mian Muhammad Shafiq and Shahid Ahmed.
Meanwhile, disgruntled PTI MNA Ramesh Kumar, in a TV programme, claimed that 35 MNAs of the ruling party were supporting the opposition on the no-confidence motion. “Yesterday, there were 33 [dissident MNAs] and today there are 35,” he claimed, stressing that none of them will return to the PTI fold.
