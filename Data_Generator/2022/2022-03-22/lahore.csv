0,"Ordinance empowers PSCA to issue e-challans, LHC told",LHC seeks arguments on section 4 of the Motor Vehicle Ordinance that deals with the eligibility for driving a vehicle.,"LAHORE: The provincial government’s lawyer on Monday told the Lahore High Court that the Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1965 empowers the Punjab Safe Cities Authority (PSCA) to issue e-challans to motorists for violation of traffic rules.
Additional Advocate General Akhtar Javed also stated that an amendment was introduced in the ordinance in 2021 to authorise the PSCA to issue e-challans. He pointed out that section 116 of the ordinance dealt with the ticketing system.
Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh was hearing a petition challenging the PSCA powers to issue e-challans.
Punjab Law Secretary Ahmad Raza Sarwar, transport secretary Nadir Chattha and PSCA chief operating officer Kamran Khan also appeared before the court.
The judge asked the law officer under what law e-challan was issued to a vehicle owner for traffic rule violation by the driver. He also asked him what would be the legal position if the authority issues an e-challan to a vehicle owner who has already died as the traffic rule is violated by its driver.
The lawyer said the vehicle owner was supposed to be responsible for any offence (related to vehicle) after its registration in his name.
The lawyer also questioned the maintainability of the petition.
The judge directed the law officer to come up with arguments on section 4 of the Motor Vehicle Ordinance that dealt with the eligibility for driving a vehicle, on the next hearing.
Falak Sher, a citizen, had filed the petition, pleading that the PSCA could only use its cameras to check speed of the vehicles plying on roads to use it as an evidence for manual challans. He said the judicial magistrate concerned had the jurisdiction to impose a fine or exonerate a motorist facing a charge after holding a summary trial.
He contended that the traffic police or the PSCA had no power to recover fines for e-challans from the vehicle owners. He pointed out that the authority had been issuing e-challans without a legal cover.
He asked the court to set aside the act of the authority as unlawful and restrain it from recovering the fine amounts from the motorists.

“The Imran Khan government is on a ventilator. Instead of committing constitutional violation, resorting to violence and begging, Imran Khan should talk to the opposition and resign for holding free and fair polls,” Rafique said in a tweet on Monday.
Meanwhile, PML-N spokesperson Maryam Aurangzeb warned Imran Khan and NA Speaker Asad Qaiser to stop taking unconstitutional measures.  
“The prime minister and the speaker have already violated the constitution by not fulfilling the constitutional requirement of the meeting in 14. By not convening the NA session in 14 days, the speaker has violated his oath and the constitution,” she said.
Ms Auranzeb said the attitude of the speaker would be written in black letters in history as he was giving priority to the interest of the party chairman over the constitution.

3,Rankers fight encroachment of top posts by PSP officers in Punjab,"Posting of federal officers on provincial seats is also against the spirit of the Constitution, say officers.","LAHORE: Provincial services police officers have written to the chief secretary that Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) officers have “illegally” occupied nearly 200 seats reserved for the provincial cadre officers in the province.
About the PSP cadre strength rules, they say that according to the schedule and the Inter-provincial Coordination Committee minutes of the meeting, only 162 out of 362 sanctioned posts are allocated to the Federal Services of Pakistan strength on a ‘sharing basis’, while the remaining posts are reserved for the provincial service.
They have filed a complaint with the Punjab chief secretary after, what they say, the senior leadership of police remained unmoved to their several correspondences in this regard.
Before filing the complaint, provincial service police officers sensitised high administrative and legal forums to take the matter to the logical end.
An official privy to the meeting of the ranker police officers said that one of the participants raised a point that currently only two ranker police officers are working as district police officers — in Okara and Mandi Bahauddin.
No ranker officer has been posted as a regional police officer in Punjab for the last many years. This aspect has further widened the gap between the two communities of the police.
They wrote to the chief secretary: “Any appointment over the above-sanctioned strength i.e. 162 is evidently illegal and tantamount to the encroachment of the rights of the provincial police officers”.
They say the posting of federal officers on provincial seats is also against the spirit of the constitution and the rules of business of the Punjab government, 2011.
They say the police officers posted through the Provincial Public Service Commission (PPSC) are eligible to be posted at the BS-19 while about 50 such posts are lying vacant.
“These officers were further eligible to be considered for the promotions to the rank of BS-20 and BS-21 in Punjab”, the letter reads.
The letter cites the police department notification dated Nov 14, 2019, that seniority and service come under the provision of section 7(2) of the Punjab Civil Servants Act of 1974 and Rule and Rule 8 of Punjab Civil Servants (Appointments, and Conditions of Services) Act of 1974. 
They say that as per Punjab rules of business 2011, section 23 (I), read with fourth schedule serial No 10, the chief minister is empowered to make appointments, promotions, postings and transfer of SSPs (BS-19), DIGs (BS-20), and additional IGs (BS-21). 
“In view of above, it is humbly submitted that the postings of the PSP officers may not be made above their scheduled posts i.e 162 shared posts in Punjab and the provincial police officers may kindly be considered for promotion against the vacant senior cadre posts”, reads the letter, asking for chief secretary’s intervention on legal and administrative grounds to ensure justice to the police officials who constitute over 90 percent of the total 200,000 Punjab police force.
IGP Rao Sardar Ali Khan said he commands and treats both provincial and federal officers equally. 
Punjab Headquarters DIG Rai Babar said that the cases of nearly 40 police officers of Punjab services serving in BS 18 have been finalized to dispatch them for encasement in the PSP. 
He rejected the claim of the provincial services officers that the amendment from the Punjab Assembly would resolve their promotion and other services related issues, saying that the amendments were also required in federal government rules.
About the claims that after encasement in the PSP, their seniority would badly damage their career, the DIG said after encasement in PSP they would have to follow the federal government rules in the given circumferences.
“What we can do is that we are ready to give them equal opportunity to avail top positions in Punjab after the change of cadre.”

Justice Jawad Hassan was hearing a petition filed by Advocate Muhammad Iqbal, who presently serves as a director legal-cum-law officer (BPS-19) at the Punjab Public Service Commission. LHC legal adviser Zubdatul Hassan was present in the court. 
The petitioner’s counsel, Safdar Shaheen Pirzada, contended that his client had applied for the post but the examination committee of the LHC dismissed his application for being unqualified for the examination. He argued that the rejection of the petitioner’s application by the respondent authority was in violation of the qualification available in rule 7(1) (b) (i) of the Punjab Judicial Service Rule 1994. He said the respondent misinterpreted the rules, declaring the district attorney, deputy district attorney or an assistant district attorney only eligible to apply for the post. 
He added that the respondent wrongly interpreted the expression of ‘practiced profession of law’ as the petitioner had been actively practising as an advocate till joining the post of director legal-cum-law officer. 
Justice Hassan observed that it was already settled that the law officers working in the attorney general and advocate general offices did not fall in the definition of the government servant. However, he noted that the law officers of government departments enjoyed full benefits like a public servant, including right to appeal and gratuity. 
The judge adjourned the hearing till March 24 and also directed the petitioner’s counsel to tell the court whether a single bench could hear the petition as the examination committee comprised three sitting judges of the LHC.

6,Punjab IGP lifts ban on promoted inspectors’ transfer after ‘controversies’,"Many of the inspectors were transferred to far-off stations from their native districts, causing problems for them, says official.","LAHORE: Punjab Inspector General of Police Rao Sardar Ali Khan has lifted the ban imposed on the transfers and postings of newly-promoted police inspectors across the province.
Imposed on Feb 4 this year, the ban was later flouted by some senior police officers who allegedly obliged some of the promoted inspectors with right connections, transferring them to stations of their choice.  
The discrimination not only sparked a controversy with in the police department, but also drew media criticism, making the senior leadership of the police to review the ban.
The department had promoted 368 sub-inspectors all over the province to the rank of inspectors and transferred them to other regions and units in October and November last year for actualisation under a standing order of the provincial police officer (PPO).
Many of the inspectors were transferred to stations located hundreds of kilometer away from their native districts, causing problems for them and their families, a senior official told Dawn.
The official said, the transferred inspectors had to also face problems related to accommodation, transportation and food, causing a great deal of inconvenience to them.
He said the sudden transfer of hundreds of inspectors also caused administrative issues for the regional and district police heads, besides the senior command of Lahore police, when the Central Police Office (CPO) turned down their requisitions to re-allocate several inspectors to their previous stations.
On the other hand, he said, the CPO on the recommendation of some ‘influential people’ transferred some of the inspectors to their previous districts, putting a question mark on the transparency of the process.  
The official added that some of the inspectors were transferred without even seeking the mandatory No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the districts concerned.  
Meanwhile, the issue was further highlighted when the CPO transferred some inspectors after imposition of the ban on Feb 4, violating its own decision.
He said that keeping in view all these anomalies, the IGP discussed the issue in a meeting, reviewed the decision and ordered lifting the ban.
A notification issued by the CPO reads, “The competent authority has lifted the ban on transfer/posting of newly promoted police inspectors with immediate effect”. However, the cases for transfer/posting of inspectors may be recommended after considering administrative exigencies as well as other related aspects, it said.
Following this, the IGP transferred over a dozen inspectors back to their previous stations and districts.

The facility, constructed by the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), was born of a partnership between the NH&MP and the US Mission in Pakistan.
US Embassy in Islamabad’s Director of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) Affairs Mark Tervakoski said the facility would help NH&MP house new women recruits and more Pakistani women would join the ranks of officers and they would inevitably widen police understanding of gender issues, and enhance the quality of service offered to all, and especially women.
UNOPS Pakistan Country Manager Marysia Zapasnik said social norms made it difficult for women to engage in policing until recently. “We believe that breaking this bias is fundamental to forging women´s equality and to ending discrimination.”
This year marks the 40th anniversary of partnership between the US Mission, through INL, and Pakistan under the banner of “Justice, Security, and Prosperity,” with efforts spanning four decades to improve citizen security and enhance law enforcement capacity across Pakistan, including by contributing the funds required for construction of the new women’s barracks.

This was stated by Potato Growers Association (PGA) Pakistan president Mian Muhammad Siddique and vice president Chaudhry Maqsood Ahmad Jutt, also chairman Potato Research & Development Board, who were talking to Dawn. 
They said they were waiting for forwarding the proposal to the government but they are waiting for the last 1.5 years for a meeting with Adviser to Prime Minister on Commerce Razak Dawood who was too ‘busy’ to spare some time to formulate potato export policy. They claimed that suggestions had already been sent to the Agro Wing working under the Federal Ministry of Commerce.  
Mr Siddique and Mr Jutt said a five-year policy for potato export was to be made by a five-member committee formed at a webinar, presided over by Mr Dawood, but it didn’t happen. The participants in the webinar included the then federal commerce secretary, the director of the Potato Research Institute (PRI) Punjab, the patron-in-chief of the Vegetable Export Association (VEA) Pakistan and others. However, no meeting was convened since then and the current harvesting season of potato was also approaching its end.  
The farmers claimed that this year potato production was bumper and it was estimated to be 6 to 7m tonne surplus but it was still just six per cent of the Chinese annual consumption (6m tonne). They said China faced a shortage of table potato from February to May.  
On the other hand, 105-110kg sack rate had fallen to Rs1,000 to Rs1,300 and beside this, the growers had to bear average Rs500 labour per bag expenditures from field to market. At the start of harvesting season, the price was Rs3,000 per sack at fruit and vegetable markets of Okara and Dipalpur. Okara district contributes more than 22pc to total national potato produce.  
Both the farmers mentioned said 230,000 tonne potato had been exported by the private sector on its own but the export was reduced after the Ukraine crisis. However, Iraq is going to purchase potato from Pakistan and Russia is in dialogue to import potato.  
The farmers, who are suffering heavy losses due to cut in potato price, demanded the Ministry of Commerce to take steps to end the plight of the growers. They said districts of Okara, Pakpattan, Sahiwal and Kasur should be given special attention because of their massive potato produce.

According to police, the minor, Jawal, son of Lal Deen Musa Khail, a resident  of Mana Ahmedani village, went to school where he was in nursery class.
When he did not return from the school at the usual time, his parents got worried and started looking for him. He was later found lying critically injured in a field near the village.   
He was rushed to Kot Chhuta Tehsil Headquarters Hospital where doctors after examining the minor boy told his parents that he was also sexually assaulted. 
He was shifted to the trauma centre of  the teaching hospital of the Ghazi Medical College, where he succumbed to his injuries.  
District Police Officer Muhammed Ali Waseem told Dawn that the suspect had been arrested and he confessed his crime. He added that the suspects DNA test would be conducted to prepare a strong case against him in the court for his conviction. 
As per police sources, the suspect is a neighbour of the victim and a former guard at the school the minor boy attended.  
The sources say that in his confessional statement the suspect said he kidnapped the minor, subjected him to rape and then hit the child with a brick and an iron rod to kill him to conceal the heinous crime.    
Kot Chhuta police had earlier registered a case against an “unidentified” suspect under sections 337, 367-A and 324 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) on charges of kidnap, rape and torture.  
However, the police said that after the minor’s death and the suspect’s arrest and his confession, other relevant sections would be added to the FIR.

This was stated by Punjab Minister for Agriculture Syed Hussain Jahania Gardezi while addressing at a Pakistan Economic Conference (PEC) session on “Agriculture: value addition, technology, export opportunity and its potential in Pakistan.”  
According to a press release issued by Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Monday, the minister said: “This conference will have a salutary impact on the national economy as the business community is now planning to switch over from textile to other segments like agriculture and IT.”
He said diversification was imperative to survive in the fast changing global environment but “we failed to concentrate and fulfil the fundamental requirements of this basic segment directly linked with food security.”  
He said technological interventions could not be introduced due to lack of finances which is the main cause of its low productivity. He said the green revolution of the 60s was ushered as “our research was directly linked with international organisations.”  
“This link was disrupted and the attention of our economists diverted from agriculture to the urbanisation,” he added.  
The minister said the role of agriculture is around 19-20 per cent and hence it must get subsided loans proportionate to its share in GDP. He lamented that delivery of available irrigation water at farm level is 50pc which means that almost half of the water is wasted at different levels.  He proposed introduction of service providing companies in the agriculture sector which could import costly machinery and rent it out to the tillers for mechanised farming. 
Gardezi said the Punjab government has encouraged this concept by reducing taxes on it. He also briefly touched on soil health and said that it is a major handicap in enhancing per acre yield and “we must focus on it to increase agricultural production.”  
This session was also addressed by University of Agriculture Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan, Dean Faculty of Agriculture Dr Amanullah Malik, Chairman Kashtkar Foundation Pakistan Munir Shaheen and others.
