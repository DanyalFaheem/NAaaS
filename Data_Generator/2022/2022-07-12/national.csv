0,Pakistanis tend to give generously to charity: survey,Says 84pc of respondents claimed to have given charity in one form or the other in past one year...,"ISLAMABAD: In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic when the country was grappled with many socioeconomic challenges such as income-based disparities, unemployment and rising poverty, it was inspiring to note that a majority of Pakistanis remained committed to philanthropic giving in one form or another, said a survey.
Conducted by Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy, the survey was undertaken during the pandemic. It was heartening to see that people even from poor socioeconomic backgrounds reported giving in one form or another. This was testament to the spirit of giving that pervaded across all classes in Pakistan.
The results signified Pakistanis as a nation of givers. About eight in 10 persons interviewed males and females said they had given charity or financially helped a poor person during the past one year. When asked about the last time they made social contributions, around 40 per cent said they did so within the past one month. On an average, a Pakistani adult reported having spent around Rs10,000 a year in charitable cause.
Drawing on the methodology from World Giving Index by Charity Aid Foundation UK (CAF), the study was an attempt to examine the norms and practices of charitable giving among Pakistani people. Data was collected through a brief questionnaire using random digital dialing (RDD) technique. The interviews were conducted by Gallup Pakistan.

Says 84pc of respondents claimed to have given charity in one form or the other in past one year

Some of the key findings showed that charitable giving was common in Pakistan. About 84pc of the respondents claimed to have given charity in one form or the other during the past one year. A relatively lower score of giving - 81pc - was reported for the rural respondents than their urban counterparts of about 86pc.
The survey noted that giving in Pakistan was not just an income or employment status phenomenon. Around 79pc of unemployed respondents also reported giving in one form or the other compared to 82pc of part-time employed persons and 89pc of employed respondents. This signified the notion that being unemployed or having low income did not deter individuals from contributing to charitable giving and helping others in need.
Primary recipients of charity were those whom givers knew personally. About 46pc recipients were the poor persons/households or family that givers knew personally and 44pc the beggars they came across. About 30pc recipients were poor persons/households or family they did not know personally.
The survey identified religion as the main motivation to give charity as stated by 67pc of the respondents. Interestingly, 72pc among high income earners cited religion as a motivating factor compared to 58pc low income and 65pc middle-income earners. The survey said richer households were more likely to pay zakat and fitrana etc.
More than six in 10, (64pc) respondents believed that charity had a large impact on Pakistan as a whole as well as on local community.
Nearly seven in 10 or 76pc Pakistanis claimed to have paid zakat, sadaqa or khairat to either family or non-family members in the last year. On average, a Pakistani adult was reported to have spent Rs10,000 in a year. Some 14pc respondents claimed to have volunteered time to an organisation at some point in a year.

ISLAMABAD: Seven people succumbed to Covid-19 in a single day, taking the total death toll to 25 so far this month, official data showed on Saturday.
Six victims belonged to Sindh and one to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The country reported 732 new cases based on 22,568 tests over the last 24 hours, translating into a positivity rate of 3.24 per cent, according to data released by the National Command and Operation Center (NCOC).
The positivity rate was 7.69pc in Muzaffarabad, followed by Karachi 5.74pc, Peshawar 4.47pc, Lahore 3.97pc and Islamabad 2.76pc.
The number of patients in critical care dropped to 158 from 165, whereas no new critical case was reported.

Death toll hits 25 so far this month; 732 new cases reported in last 24 hours

Dr Qaiser Sajjad, secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), told Dawn citizens should strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures (SOPs), as it would help to limit the number of daily cases.
“For last three years, the number of Covid-19 cases increased on the occasions of Eid. We request the masses to wear masks and even glasses as virus enters the body from nose, mouth and eyes,” he said in a video statement.
“Maintain social distancing and do not shake hands,” he asked citizens, urging them to be careful during Eid parties “as we are heading towards the sixth wave of the pandemic” and the burden on hospitals was already on the rise.
Dr Sajjad said it was a proven fact that vaccinated people had fewer chances of developing Covid complications.
“If you have got one dose of vaccine, go for the second one, and those who are fully vaccinated should go for first and second booster shots,” he said.
In a statement, the PMA linked the surge in Covid cases to negligence in adopting preventive measures like social distancing and wearing masks.
“People are mostly seen without masks at markets, social gatherings, wedding ceremonies, family get-togethers, at public transport and malls. Without adhering to SOPs, the cases will continue to rise,” it said.
“We should be very careful to avoid any untoward situation that can lead to worsening the Covid-19 situation in the country,” it stated. “The PMA also suggests the government to immediately initiate a media campaign to counter the misconceptions regarding vaccine and create awareness among masses to get booster doses.”
It also urged the government to strictly implement the SOPs, especially making the use of face masks mandatory for every citizen.

3,SC judge says opinion on Article 63-A ‘not binding’,"In dissenting note, Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel says SC's opinion on presidential reference not binding upon govt.","ISLAMABAD: Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel has said the Supreme Court’s opinion on the presidential reference seeking interpretation of Article 63-A which pertained to defection, was not binding upon the government.
In his dissenting note, Justice Miankhel, who will reach the age of superannuation on July 13, said that according to Article 189, any decision of the Supreme Court under articles 184, 185 or 188 (review jurisdiction) to the extent that it decides a question of law or is based on or enunciates a principle of law, is binding on all other courts in Pakistan.
“Therefore, it would be fair to say that the opinion expressed by the Supreme Court on the presidential reference under Article 186 of the constitution has no binding,” the judge wrote in his 17-page note.
Justice Miankhel observed that Article 186 provided the top court the advisory jurisdiction but was different from its jurisdiction under articles 184 and 185, which empower it to hear and decide appeals against high court orders.
He also cited the 2005 opinion of the SC in the Hisba Bill presidential reference in which a nine-judge bench headed by then chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry had used the same expression and maintained that the advisory jurisdiction of the apex court was definitely different and distinct from the jurisdiction under articles 184 and 185.

6,Ministry starts probe into Pakistan Steel Mills' affairs under PTI govt,Asks PSM CEO to submit report on alleged negligence of senior officials that cost Rs284bn to national exchequer.,"ISLAMABAD: In compliance with the Public Accou­nts Committee’s (PAC) direction, the Ministry of Industries and Production has asked the Pakistan Steels Mills (PSM) CEO to submit a report on the alleged negligence of senior officials that cost Rs284 billion to the national exchequer. 
The PAC took notice of the matter on a complaint filed by the mill’s Peoples Workers Union (PWU) and issued directions on June 1. In a June 7 letter written to the Pakistan Steel Mills, the industries ministry highlighted the events from 2018 to 2022 in the PSM and said it would help “expose the conspiracy nexus between the PTI government and Arif Habib Group.” 
The ministry said the PTI government had always blamed the PSM’s failure on its human resources, which was “unjustified” because the mill’s workers were trained and responsible and always acted as per the management’s order. 
The PSM is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Industries and Production, with its secretary being the principal accounts officer (PAO), who is responsible for appointing and monitoring the performance of the board of directors (BoD) and top-tier management. 
The PWU said in its complaint that after 2018, the BoD mostly appointed non-professional “men of choice who don’t know the functions of an integrated steel plant”. 
It lamented that a recommendation made to the industries ministry for the post of CEO was for PSM’s revival, but he was neither a metallurgist nor did he have any experience regarding an integrated steel plant. 
Therefore, the PWU said, the appointment violated the Pakistan Steel Officers Services Rules, the Public Sector Companies (Cor­porate Governance) Rules 2013 and the Public Sector Companies (Appointment of Chief Executive) Guideline 2015. It also alleged that the industries ministry never monitored the BoD’s and top management’s performance, which was evident from the steel mill’s audited accounts from 2018 to 2021.
While asserting that a CEO was responsible for a company’s profit or loss, the union said the ministry’s disinterest in monitoring the mills’ management performance led to a loss of Rs284bn during the PTI government’s 44-month tenure.
It recalled that during the election campaign of 2018, former prime minister Imran Khan and PTI leader Asad Umar promised that their government would revive the PSM but then “they failed to keep their promise after coming to power”. 
The PWU also appealed for the removal of the PSM’s board of directors and management and sought an FIA investigation into the alleged theft of items worth more than Rs10bn and identify those responsible.

7,Pakistan envoy Masood Khan meets President Biden,Visits White House to honor the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between US and Pakistan.,"WASHINGTON: Pakistan’s Amba­ssador to the United States Masood Khan visited the White House on Saturday to meet President Joe Biden to honor the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries. 
“It was an honor to meet President Biden at the Oval office,” the ambassador said in a tweet released after the meeting. This strengthened “the resolve to further strengthen Pakistan-US ties,” he added.

 





 
Ambassador Masood Khan previously met President Biden on June 15 at the White House — an established tradition in Washington for newly appointed envoys. 
According to the press release issued by the Pakistan embassy, during the ceremony, President Biden and Ambassador Khan had a brief conversation on building a strong basis for moving the US-Pakistan ties forward. 
Forty-six other ambassadors were also present to have an official photograph with the president one by one. They too had not been able to call on President Biden for more than a year because of Covid-19 restrictions. 
Ambassador Khan was sent to Washington on March 25, when the PTI government was still in power, but after former prime minister Imran Khan’s ouster on April 11, there was speculation that the change in Islamabad would also impact diplomatic appointments. 
Later, Pakistan’s envoy to the United Nations, Ambassador Munir Akram, explained that incumbent ambassadors continue to represent the country in foreign capitals unless specifically asked by the new government to return home. Neither Ambassador Khan nor Ambassador Akram was asked to do so. 
The White House’s endorsement of Ambassador Khan’s appointment comes despite a strong opposition from the Indian lobby in Washington who did not want a Kashmiri to represent Pakistan in the US capital. 
The Indian lobby feared that it would strengthen the Kashmir cause and launched a major campaign to convince the Biden administration not to accept Ambassador Khan’s credentials. They persuaded the US lawmakers to write letters to various US officials, urging them to ask Islamabad to send another envoy. But their pleas were ignored.

8,Weather dampens mountaineers’ summit dreams,"GILGIT: Over 1,400 climbers gathered in the north of Pakistan to scale mountains, particularly K-2,...","GILGIT: Over 1,400 climbers gathered in the north of Pakistan to scale mountains, particularly K-2, Broad Peak, and Nanga Parbat, have seen their summit hopes dashed due to bad weather, communication problems, and landslide-induced roadblocks. 
At least 300 climbers are present at K-2’s base camp while the same number of climbers are aiming to scale Broad Peak. At least 100 contenders wish to summit Nanga Park whereas an unknown number of aspirants are present in the region to summit Gasherbrum-I (8,080m), Gasherbrum-II (8,035m), and other above 6,000m peaks in the area.
A tour operator told Dawn that his three expedition teams were present at the K-2 base camp but they could not manage to reach the top due to bad weather. As of now, they have managed to reach Camp 3 but weather conditions at the peak compelled them to return to the base camp, as per the operator. The climbers are in rotation between Camp 3 and the base camp, Sakhawat Hussain said. 
As per the forecast, the weather conditions will remain bad till July 17; however, the expedition members will manage to establish Camp 4 to make a push to reach the summit if given a chance by the weather.
Tour operators in the area also complained about poor communication services at the base camp of K-2 which was resulting in confusion. Similarly, the road from Skardu to Askoli is blocked at six points, creating difficulties for the climbers to reach base camps of the peaks from Skardu. It may be noted here that flooding and glacier melting had swept away multiple bridges on the road to Askoli.
Meanwhile, efforts to recover mountaineers Sharif Sadpara and Iman Karim who went missing on Broad Peak failed to produce any positive results. British mountaineer Paul and Dilawar, a member of the Sharif Sadpara team, looked for possible clues to find the two climbers but their efforts remained an exercise in futility.

10,Tobacco firms move court as FBR implements tracking system,The FBR has banned all tobacco companies from selling cigarettes without tax stamps.,"ISLAMABAD: As the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is gearing up to implement the track-and-trace (T&T) system in all four identified sectors, some tobacco companies have filed another case against the tax collection body.
As the FBR has banned all tobacco companies from selling cigarettes without tax stamps, some companies who earlier filed a case against the FBR have again filed a writ petition in the Peshawar High Court (PHC) seeking relaxation from the T&T system.
The cigarette makers have argued that their old stocks manufactured up to June 30 should be allowed to be sold because the T&T system was implemented from July 1.
On the other hand, the FBR maintains that the old stocks have to be cleared by June 30 and the current laws apply to sales made during the new fiscal year. The next hearing is set for July 13.
The implementation of the track-and-trace system was already delayed after 12 cigarette manufacturers earlier filed a case in the PHC, demanding that the cost of implementing the system had to be borne by the FBR.
However, soon after the PHC turned down the request in the last week of June, FBR teams from July 4 started stopping the movement of those cigarette stocks from the factory premises that did not have tax stamps containing the Unique Identification Marking (UIM) of the T&T system.
Of the 40 registered cigarette makers, 21 are operational at present, of which only three have implemented the T&T system, whereas 18 have yet to sign the agreement with the FBR in this regard and therefore their sales have been stopped.
Tariq Hussain Shaikh, project director of the T&T system, said the three cigarette manufacturers who have implemented the tracking system included two multinationals, namely the Pakistan Tobacco Company and Philip Morris.
The only local company to have installed the system is the Khyber Tobacco Company (KTC), which expects that its contribution to taxes was around Rs2 billion in the 2021-22 fiscal year. KTC Chief Technology Officer Shahid Sattar said the move would help the company enhance its presence in the Pakistani market and improve the quality of its products to international standards. He said the export target set by the government for KTC was $100 million during 2022-23. 
FBR’s Mr Shaikh said the T&T system would help overcome huge losses from the four sectors — tobacco, sugar, cement and fertiliser. The system has already been implemented in the sugar sector from Nov 23, 2021 for the crushing season 2021-22, registering an increase of around 34pc in terms of sales tax compared to the previous year.
The system has been implemented in the fertiliser and cigarette sectors from the start of the current fiscal year, whereas it is scheduled to be implemented in the cement sector from October.
