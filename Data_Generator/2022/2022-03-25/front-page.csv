0,No-trust on agenda as ‘fateful’ NA sitting begins,It is believed that normal proceedings will not be held on the first day of the sitting due to the death of MNA Khayal Zaman.,"ISLAMABAD: The much-anticipated session of the National Assembly with a crucial no-confidence resolution — filed by the opposition against Prime Minister Imran Khan — on the agenda, is set to commence at 11am today (Friday).  
However, despite the fact that the resolution has been placed on the agenda for today’s sitting, it may not be tabled for discussion on the same day.  
The National Assembly Secretariat on Thursday issued a 15-point ‘Orders of the Day’ for the NA session, which included the no-confidence resolution, but it is believed that normal house proceedings will not be held on the first day of the sitting due to death of MNA Khayal Zaman.
It is parliamentary convention that the first sitting after the death of an MNA is limited to prayers for the soul of the departed and tributes fellow lawmakers wish to pay them. 
Insiders suggest that the NA speaker may adjourn the session until March 30 or 31. However, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry told Dawn that there was no plan to adjourn the NA session. 

PTI not holding parliamentary party meeting before sitting

The opposition had submitted the motion and requisition for the session to the NA Secretariat on March 8. Under the Constitution, the speaker was bound to hold the session within 14 days. However, he did not summon the session until March 21 [the 14th day], which is now set to commence from today. 
Voting on the resolution will be held at least three to seven days after it has been laid before the National Assembly.   
Explainer: How does a no-confidence motion work? 
In a break from tradition, the ruling PTI has so far not called for meeting of its parliamentary party — a staple strategy session held before any NA sitting — but while the opposition is convening its meeting in Parliament House ahead of the sitting. 
The fact that the ruling party has not called for a meeting could indicate one of two scenarios. On one hand, it could mean that the government is aware that the first day of the NA session will only last a few minutes and the session would be adjourned in deference to convention. Another possibility is that since the government’s allies and dissident PTI members are also due to hold their own, separate meetings, the ruling party fears that they would not attend its parliamentary party meeting.  
High security
Meanwhile, the NA speaker on Thursday issued guidelines for MNAs in view of strict security arrangements being made for the session. 
According to the speaker’s notification: “no visitor/guest/security guard of the ministers/parliamentarians will be allowed in the precincts of Parliament House and it would be advisable to restrict them up to D-Chowk, in front of Parliament Lodges.” 
To avoid traffic congestion, a shuttle service will operate between Parliament Lodges, government hostels and Parliament House to facilitate members of parliament, the order said.  
It said personal drivers of parliamentarians were required to park their vehicles at the designated parking area and not to leave the vehicle unattended. Security agencies deputed at the Parliament House have also been instructed to make arrangements accordingly and ensure the implementation of the speaker’s instructions.  
PTI power show
Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan, chairing a meeting of the PTI political committee, directed party leaders to finalise arrangements for what he called “the country’s biggest public meeting” on March 27.  
Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the prime minister was satisfied with the first hearing by the Supreme Court of the government’s reference about no-confidence resolution and said “so far the observation of the apex court have been encouraging” for the government.  
A PTI source said the prime minister was confident that he could defeat the opposition’s no-confidence resolution.  
The prime minister told the meeting that he was hopeful that the apex court would define disqualification of dissident PTI members for life for voting against him. He said the PTI had already served notices on over a dozen PTI dissidents and action would be taken against them after seven days (March 27). However, it was not mentioned what action would be taken against them.  
Senator Faisal Javed told the media that the prime minister would show “a triumph” card a day before the voting on the no-trust resolution.  
Prime Minister Khan also invited the nation to participate in the March 27 public gathering and show their condemnation of the brazen horse-trading aimed at harming democracy in the country. “I want my entire nation to come out with me on March 27 to give a loud message that we are not supporting evil and are against it,” he said in a video message.  
In the message telecast on national television and social media platforms of the PTI, the prime minister urged the nation to stand by the good to fight out the politics of corruption.

The prime minister said the “gang of dacoits”, which had been looting the country for 30 years, indulged in massive corruption and illegal transfer of money abroad. “This gang is openly buying the conscience and loyalties of the public representatives,” he said, terming it a “crime against the nation and democracy”.  
He said: “All the Pakistanis must realise that no one in the future has the courage to do horse-trading and damage the democracy and the nation.”  
On the other hand, the opposition criticised the prime minister for using state resources for the success of the March 27 PTI public meeting.

1,"Discarding votes an insult to lawmakers, says CJP",Justice Munib Akhtar says those committed to parties must adhere to their discipline...,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial on Thursday observed that it would be an insult to the lawmakers if the vote they cast in parliament was ignored and discarded as if it is worth nothing.  
“Article 63-A of the Constitution is an evolution of the political system,” the CJP observed, adding that Article 96 of the 1962 constitution provided a remedy by not counting the vote of members in case of any defection, but it was deleted and now Article 63-A has been inserted through the 18th Amendment, which expressed in clear terms when defection applies.  
CJP Bandial observed this while heading a five-judge Supreme Court bench, which was hearing a petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), as well as the presidential reference seeking interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution.  
A number of replies were filed by the JUI-F, PPP and SCBA highlighting that Article 63-A was undemocratic and that the ruling PTI itself had never held intra-party elections.  

Justice Munib Akhtar says those committed to parties must adhere to their discipline

CJP Bandial observed that the court could understand the constitutional provision in one way while the intent of its original framers might be different. Therefore, he said, these issues must be debated and decided by parliament instead of the court filling in the blanks.  
The CJP explained that de-seating a member over defection was a two-stage process; after issuing a show-cause notice the matter would be referred to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), which would determine whether the procedure was followed. Besides, he said, the appeal against the commission’s decision would come before the apex court to decide.  
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel cited Article 55 of the Constitution and wondered when the government itself had the answer, then why it was seeking an answer from the court. In the developed world, he said, it was the parliamentary majority, and not the party head, which decided candidates for the premiership.  
“Why do you want to make the party head a king?” Justice Mandokhel asked, pointing towards Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan.  
The AGP said every society had its own norms like in the West the prices of items were reduced before Christmas while here prices were doubled before the advent of Ramazan. He emphasised that one should not encourage ‘lotacracy’ — a term used for turncoats.  
Article 55 explains that all decisions in the National Assembly will be taken by the majority of members present and voting.  
Justice Mandokhel reminded that party discipline also had certain limits, since members also had some responsibility towards their electorate.  
Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel observed that Article 63-A clearly defined the defection of a member, reminding that a member decided to raise his voice against party lines on some grounds or reasons.  
The AGP explained that the reference was instituted in view of the emergent situation when certain members took refuge inside the Sindh House and certain allegations were levelled regarding buying and selling of their loyalties. This gave rise to the need for interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution and the theme was to disqualify the person for life as a consequence if declared to have defected, he argued, adding that Articles 62 (qualification), 63 (disqualification) and 63-A (defection) were like a family and should be read in conjunction as they were not stand-alone provisions.  
Citing Articles 19 and 51(2) of the Constitution, the AGP argued that vote cast by the citizens in elections was an irreversible exercise and translated into the party strength in the assembly. Hence, the party, through its elected members steered by the party whip, carried the voters’ mandate to implement its manifesto in the House for legislation and policymaking, he added  
At this, Justice Ijazul Ahsan said the AGP was trying to establish that ordinary citizens and parliamentarians were different species and carried different rights and obligations, and that the parliamentarians were not acting as free agents.  
The AGP explained that Article 63-A was essentially an anti-defection provision, meant to curb the age-old menace of horse-trading which had pervaded the political system. “Its true impact and effect cannot be appreciated by isolated reading of Article 63-A and its interpretation requires appreciation of history, the mischief which it means to eradicate, and to see whether its conventional understanding and interpretation has frustrated or promoted achievement of the highly desirable constitutional goal.”  
The idea was to prevent defection instead of promoting it, the AGP said, adding that the individual vote of the member was a rudderless one in  parliamentary democracy. 
Justice Munib Akhtar observed that in the party, the entire system would collapse if the members functioned individually and, therefore, they were constrained to follow party lines. “If you are committed to a political party then one has to adhere to its disciple, otherwise the entire party will collapse,” he observed. 
Sindh House incident 
Meanwhile, the apex court noted that the Sindh government had recorded its version to the Islamabad police on Sindh House’s March 19 events and that the inspector general had assured them of its incorporation in the FIR and subsequent action.  
The court noted that the JUI-F had moved an application before the district management of Islamabad for holding a rally and subsequent sit-in close to the Kashmir Highway, but the administration believed that it would be difficult to manage since the road led to the airport; besides, other rallies would also pass through this road.  
Senator Kamran Murtaza, representing the JUI-F, however, assured the court that they would act strictly in accordance with the Constitution and law and abide by whatever decided.  
During the hearing, CJP Bandial observed that one should make example of democratic behaviour. Referring to Raza Rabbani, he observed that the court wanted to make him amicus curiae, but since he was representing a political party, it would like to hear him.  
The case will be taken up again on Friday.

2,China says willing to extend CPEC to Afghanistan,"China willing to promote extension of CPEC to Afghanistan, making latter a bridge for regional connectivity: Chinese FM.","KABUL: Beijing welcomes Afghanistan’s active participation in the Belt and Road Initiative, a global infrastructure plan proposed by China, and is willing to push for extending the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) to Afghanistan, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday as he made a surprise visit to Kabul.   
Wang met acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to discuss political and economic ties, including starting work in the mining sector and Afghanistan’s possible role in China’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, according to a statement from an Afghan foreign ministry spokesman.
China was willing to promote the extension of CPEC to Afghanistan, making the latter a bridge for regional connectivity, Wang said on Thursday . 
He also said China hoped Afghanistan would fulfil its commitment of not allowing any external forces to use its territory as a tool to oppose neighbours, or harm the security of other nations. 
Wang visited Kabul on Thursday, a spokesman for Afghanistan’s foreign ministry said, the highest-level visit by a Chinese official since the Taliban took power last year and a day after many in the global community were angered by the group’s closure of girls’ high schools.
China is among just a handful of countries, including Pakistan and Qatar, that has sent a minister to Afghanistan since the Taliban took over the country in August.
Foreign governments, including Beijing, have held back on formally recognising the Taliban administration, with many saying the Taliban need to prove their commitment to human rights, counter-terrorism and inclusive governance.
The visit came after widespread global condemnation of the Taliban administration a day earlier, when it unexpectedly ordered girls home from high school, an abrupt U-turn on policy after having said earlier in the week school would be open to all students.
China will host a meeting of regional foreign ministers later this month, and the statement said Muttaqi would also participate in the meeting.
Earlier in September, Pakistan also discussed Taliban-led Afghanistan joining the multibillion-dollar CPEC infrastructure project.
“Regional connectivity is an important element of our discussion with Afghan leadership and our way forward for our economic interaction with Afghanistan,” said Mansoor Ahmad Khan, Pakistan’s envoy to Kabul, in an interview with Reuters at the time.
“This important project — China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ... provides good opportunities, good potential for providing infrastructure and energy connectivity between Afghanistan and Pakistan ... (and) also connecting South Asia to the Central Asian region.”
Mr Khan said that discussions had been held with the Taliban-led administration on this and other ways to develop the country’s economy.
“I think there has been deep interest in terms of developing economic connectivity of Afghanistan with Pakistan through CPEC and with other neighbouring countries including Iran, China, Central Asian countries.”
Under CPEC, Beijing has pledged over $60 billion for infrastructure projects in Pakistan, much of it in the form of loans.
CPEC is a central part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was launched by President Xi Jinping in 2013 with an aim to harness China’s strengths in financing and infrastructure construction to “build a broad community of shared interests” throughout Asia, Africa and Latin America.

3,"ECP fines PM, KP chief minister for poll code violations in Malakand","Premier, chief minister, federal ministers Murad Saeed and Ali Haider Zaidi, and provincial minister Shakeel Khan fined Rs50,000.","PESHAWAR: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday imposed a fine of Rs50,000 each on Prime Minister Imran Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan and three other holders of public offices for addressing a public meeting in Malakand in violation of the code of conduct devised for local government elections.
Malakand’s district monitoring officer (DMO) Ziaur Rehman issued five separate orders, directing the prime minister, chief minister, federal ministers Murad Saeed and Ali Haider Zaidi and provincial minister Shakeel Khan to deposit the fine till March 27. Mr Rehman stated that under Section 234(5) of the Elections Act, 2017 the prime minister and the four other functionaries had the right to file an appeal before the ECP within three days of the order.
The prime minister and others had addressed the rally in Malakand on March 20 despite the ECP’s letters addressed to them, asking them to refrain from doing so.
Earlier, Prime Minister Khan was fined Rs50,000 each by the respective DMOs for addressing public meetings in Lower Dir and Swat.
In a notice issued on the 20th, the DMO had asked the prime minister to appear in person before him or send a counsel instead on March 22. But when he did not turn up on the 22nd he was asked to appear on March 24. However, Mr Khan neither appeared in person nor sent a counsel.
“And whereas, perusal of various (pieces of) evidence comprising videos, photos, coupled with media reports and deliberately non-provision of response on behalf of Mr Imran Khan, it has been established that the respondent (Mr Khan) has participated in Jalsa/public gathering at tehsil Dargai on 20-03-2022,” the order said.
It added that Mr Khan also used government machinery for political campaigning of the PTI candidate, which was a sheer violation of Clause 16(2) of the revised code of conduct as amended by the ECP through an order on March 10.
The revised code of conduct bars public office holders — including the president, prime minister, chairman, deputy chairman of senate, speaker/deputy speaker of an assembly, federal ministers, ministers of state, governors, chief ministers, provincial ministers and advisers to the prime minister, mayors/chairman/nazim, and their deputies — from participating in campaigning.
On Wednesday, the Malakand’s DMO issued a notice to Pakistan Peoples Party’s chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, asking him to explain his position on March 25 as he had violated the code of conduct by attending a public meeting in Malakand.
The DMO had earlier issued an advisory to him, advising him not to attend the said public meeting.
A senior ECP official, when contacted, said that though the law apparently provides for a maximum fine of Rs50,000 for violation of the code of conduct, it was only restricted to the violation for the first time.
He said if the code of conduct is violated by someone more than once, the ECP under Article 218(3) had all the powers to act against him.
Answering a question, he said Prime Minister Khan had violated the code of conduct for a second time in a few days in two districts of KP and the ECP might summon him upon receiving a report from the provincial election commissioner.
He recalled that there was an instance of the ECP disqualifying an electoral candidate over violation of code of conduct.
He disclosed that Federal Railways Minister Azam Swati and Ahmad Hussain Shah, an MPA, had already been summoned to appear before the ECP on March 28, after the violation of the code of conduct for the second time.

4,"PTI ‘disowns’ accounts opened, operated by top leaders",The party has disowned 11 accounts and said a total of Rs23.22 million was transferred to them from PTI’s Central Accounts.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf has disowned nearly a dozen ‘unauthorised’ bank accounts that were opened and operated by, among others, key leaders such as National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Shah Farman.
The revelation came in written replies submitted by the party to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on March 15, in response to questions raised by a report of the commission’s scrutiny committee. 
On page 112 of the reply, the party disowned the 11 accounts and said a total of Rs23.22 million was transferred to them from PTI’s Central Accounts. The party also admitted that an amount of Rs57m was deposited in the 11 accounts from local sources, which were never accounted for with the Central Accounts. 
In its response, the party claimed that the moment it learned about the bank accounts, it initiated “an appropriate and required exercise” to ascertain whether the accounts  pertained to the PTI, details of the persons who opened and operated the  accounts and details and nature of all financial transactions carried  out.  

In report submitted to ECP, party claims it was ‘unaware’ of accounts until SBP disclosure

“Accordingly, PTI Finance Depart­ment communicated with the concerned  bank, requesting bank state­ment(s), bank signatories, and other  relevant information,” the PTI said.  
The banks  provided the information in response to the PTI’s request, the reply said. It stated that the  party carried out a detailed analysis and review of the information and  bank statements and identified the individuals who  opened the accounts.  
The PTI submitted to the ECP that the 11 accounts  were operated by individuals who were not authorised by the competent  authority and that these were being operated without the knowledge of the  party’s finance department.
Others named as operators of ‘unauthorised accounts’ include Senior Punjab Minister Mian Mahmud-ur-Rasheed, former president of PTI Punjab late Ahsan Rasheed, former MPA from Sindh and renowned architect Samar Ali Khan, former MPA from Sindh Seema Zia, Sindh MNA Najeeb Haroon, former president of PTI Sindh Jahangir Rehman, former PTI general secretary from KP Khalid Masood and close friend and adviser of Imran Khan, late Naeemul Haq.  
Yet others on the list include M. Ahsan Naveed, Syed M. Javaid, Sheikh Awais, Zafarullah Khan Khattak, Hamidul Haq, Sulman Bashir Awan, Sheikh Muhammad Hussain, Mian Muhammad Farooq, Bashir Ahmad, Muhammad Anwar, Rushna Shoaib, Farah Naz and Muhammad Saleem Khan.  
“It is to bring the fact on record that bank account No ... maintained with … came to the knowledge and information of PTI upon the disclosure of the same by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)”, all the identical replies about the 11 accounts said.  
The replies said the SBP shared with the ECP’s Scrutiny Committee a list of all bank accounts opened in the name of PTI since the party’s inception, and the committee shared the same list with the party.  
The 11 PTI accounts are disowned by the PTI on pages 113, 118, 120,  132, 144, 157, 159, 169, 178, 197, and page 199 of PTI’s written reply  submitted to the ECP. 
The report of the ECP Scrutiny Committee was shared with the party on Jan 4. After repeated reminders, the PTI finally submitted its comments on March 15, after a delay of two and a half months.
