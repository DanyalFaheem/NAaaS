0,No sign of rainfall in coming days,ISLAMABAD: The pollen count continues to rise in the federal capital amid the very warm and dry weather conditions...,"ISLAMABAD: The pollen count continues to rise in the federal capital amid the very warm and dry weather conditions and the bad news for the allergy sensitive people is that there is no sign of rainfall in coming days.
The pollen count has reached 41,224 particles per cubic metre (PPM) in H-8.
The hot, dry and windy conditions result in higher pollen and mold concentrations, and increased allergy symptoms because pollens are microscopic particles and easily spread over great distances by wind.
On the other hand, the Met Office has predicted that the hot and dry weather conditions will prevail till the end of the current month.
It also predicted below normal precipitation over most parts of the country, including northern Punjab and Islamabad, in April and May.
Extremely high concentrations of pollen are observed in March and April that start to fade off in May and June. However, there is a pollen concentration in the monsoon season too in the federal capital.
The pollen grains are the male tiny particles which are released from trees, weeds and grasses. The pollen grains function is to fertilise other parts of plants but many never reach their targets and remain suspended in the atmosphere.
Most species of pollen have some level of allergenicity but not all of them cause sensitivities for humans.
Islamabad is among the cities with the highest pollen counts in the world because of the population of paper mulberry trees.
The pollen count from the paper mulberry and other sources, including pines, grasses, flowers and some fungi, was less than 7,000 PPM in F-10 while in E-8 and G-6 it was recorded at 8,184 and 7,942, respectively.

1,Minister’s anti-SCBA diatribe divides legal fraternity,Some lawyers are irked by Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry's remarks over the credibility of the SCBA.,"ISLAMABAD / LAHORE: While some lawyers were irked by the uncharitable remarks of Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry over the credibility of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and demanded that the apex court take notice, others accused the incumbent leadership of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and the SCBA of becoming a tool in the hands of political parties. 
The SCBA has, over the past few days, issued multiple statements warning the government not to create hurdles in the way of voting on the no-confidence motion against the prime minister and avoid a public gathering in the vicinity of the Parliament House. 
The association has also filed a petition in the Supreme Court, urging the latter to direct all the state functionaries as well as stakeholders to allow peaceful execution of the proceedings on the no-confidence vote against the prime minister in the National Assembly, anticipated to be held on March 28, and prevent a possible “anarchic situation” that could result from the government and opposition clashing with each other. 
Taking up the petition on Thursday, a five-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, also heard the attorney general’s arguments on the presidential reference seeking the court’s opinion on the issue of lawmakers’ defection. Federal ministers Asad Umar, Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Fawad Chaudhry and others were present inside the courtroom. 

Bhoon terms Fawad’s attitude ‘immature’; opponents accuse PBC, SCBA leaders of toeing ‘political party’s agenda’

After the proceedings, Mr Chaudhry, while addressing the media, censured the SCBA for filing the petition. He called the bar association “a subsidiary of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)” and urged the PBC to take strict notice of the measures taken by the SCBA. 
Taking exception to the minister’s outburst, SCBA president Ahsan Bhoon termed Mr Chaudhry’s attitude “immature” and “non-serious” and said that it was ironic that a federal minister could not show grace and sanity. 
PBC member Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar, however, condemned the minister’s statement. Tarrar, who was elected as senator on a PML-N ticket, urged the Supreme Court to summon Mr Chaudhry for denting the reputation of the lawyers’ body. He claimed that the information minister was trying to politicise the SCBA’s petition by making such allegations against it. 
‘Tools of political parties’
On the other hand, office-bearers of different bars belonging to the Hamid Khan-led Professional group, an opponent of the Ahsan Bhoon-led Independent group, seemed to speak in unison with the information minister, accusing the incumbent leadership of the PBC and SCBA of becoming a tool in the hands of political parties. 
The Independent group, also known as the Asma Jahangir group, enjoyed a majority in the PBC. 
Speaking at a press conference in the Karachi Shuhada Hall of the Lahore High Court Bar Association, they said the two top bars had been toeing agendas of a specific political party. PBC members Shafqat Chohan and Maqsood Buttar and Lahore Bar Association president Rao Sami were among the main speakers. 
They primarily criticised the SCBA for filing petitions in the Supreme Court to protect the interests of political parties. They said the SCBA leadership had been misusing the platform of the bar and the mandate of the legal fraternity. 
They urged the PBC and SCBA representatives to stop using their offices for the agendas of political parties, and instead serve the legal community.

3,TTP Sindh chief shot dead in Kandahar,Abdul Wahab Lark was killed on Tuesday by unidentified gunmen.,"ISLAMABAD: A counter-terrorism official on Thursday confirmed that the chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s Sindh chapter, Abdul Wahab Lark, had been killed in Afghanistan. 
Wahab was killed in Kandahar city on Tuesday by unidentified gunmen. His killing was initially reported by the Afghan media on Wednesday. 
The counter-terrorism official said he was shot dead around 10.30am by two unknown attackers. Wahab — who was also known by aliases Hakeem Ali Jan, Hakeem Saleh, Khushi Mohammad and Khanushi Badosh — had joined the TTP in July/August 2020 and was currently leading its Sindh chapter. 
He previously belonged to Usman Saifullah Kurd’s group of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a sectarian outfit, and had later joined the TTP along with a number of LeJ militants. He had pledged allegiance to the group’s emir Noor Wali Mehsud. 
The TTP had on Aug 5, 2020, announced that Wahab had merged his faction of LeJ with it. The TTP had included him in its folds for reinforcing its operational capacity. The official said his name was written in the Red Book which contains the names of high-profile terrorists. 
He was reportedly involved in the Jan 30, 2015, suicide attack on Shikarpur Imambargah in which 53 people were martyred and the Aug 15, 2014, attack on PAF Samungali Base, Quetta, and Army Aviation Base Khalid.

4,"PFUJ, HRCP urge PTI, opposition to put off rallies",Voice concern over increasing polarisation in the run-up to the NA session on the no-trust motion against the prime minister.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakis­tan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) have expressed concern over the increasing polarisation in the run-up to the National Assembly session on the no-confidence motion against the prime minister. 
Hina Jilani, the HRCP chairperson, secretary general Harris Khalique, PFUJ president Shahzada Zulfiqar and secretary general Nasir Zaidi said in a joint statement that there was “a danger of violent clash” between supporters of rival political camps on the eve of the vote in NA. 
“A breakdown of law and order will not only undermine a constitutional political process inside the House, but also play directly into the hands of undemocratic forces. Being non-partisan, the PFUJ and HRCP believe in upholding principles of democracy, constitutionalism and parliamentary supremacy wherein parliament is allowed freely to perform its functions under the Constitution. 
“Proceedings in the no-trust vote must be allowed to be carried out without coercion and hindrance. A show of strength resulting in a clash outside parliament on that day will undermine the proceedings inside the House. This must be avoided at all costs,” the HRCP and the PFUJ observed. 
The joint statement noted that separate venues had now been allotted for the public meetings of the ruling party and the opposition. But since the route to the two venues for rival workers is almost the same, there is a real danger of clashes between workers on the day, it feared.

5,Rashid hints at possibility of early elections,Claims some opposition MNAs have joined hands with government...,"LAHORE: Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed on Thursday triggered a fresh debate when he told members of the ruling party that “switching sides won’t do them any good” because “early elections can also be called”.
Speaking at a press conference at the chief minister’s secretariat on  Thursday, the minister hoped the ruling party’s allies would also take a  final decision in a day or two, acknowledging that they usually took  such decisions at the eleventh hour. 
Hinting at the possibility of early elections, he said: “Those who are changing parties and thinking they will get respect, they are wrong.”
Surprisingly, after incessantly blamed opposition parties for indulging in horse-trading and attempting to purchase the loyalties of ruling party MNAs, who were seen at Sindh House, the interior minister himself claimed the government now had the support of some opposition MNAs and would be able to foil the no-confidence motion being brought against Prime Minister Imran Khan. 

Claims some opposition MNAs have joined hands with government

“If the opposition has the support of some ruling party MNAs, we also have some opposition MNAs on our side,” the minister said, adding that there would be an ‘interesting match’ on the day of voting on the no-confidence move in the National Assembly. 
He claimed these opposition MNAs would abstain from voting as they were convinced Prime Minister Khan should complete his term in office. “No MNA going to the National Assembly will be stopped or their way hindered,” he stated. 
The minister also commented that the three main opposition parties had no love lost for each other, and hoped they stayed united for the next eight days. 
Mentioning that the establishment always stood with the state and continued to do so, Mr Rashid said democracy would continue getting stronger and politicians learn to solve their problems on their own.

6,Footprints: HEER SOHO OUT TO PROVE WOMEN CAN LEAD,Soho feels the participation of women in all walks of life is unavoidable if a society is to change.,"“MAKING a woman the tribal sarbarah (elder/head) is a big challenge. The more people around me say women cannot do certain things or that women are not meant to lead, the more I want to prove them wrong,” says Heer Soho, a female politician from Sindh.   
The past few days have been heady for Soho as word spread of her being ‘selected as the first female tribal chief in Pakistan’, something which she says is a matter of immense pride, but a great responsibility at the same time.  
After Eid, she will formally become the chief of the Soho clan in a ceremony and might even get to wear the dastaar. “It could be an Ajrak, shawl or even a pagri,” she says.  
A mild-mannered woman in her 40s, Soho beams with pride when she starts talking about her life and the most influential person who gave her a sense of direction.  
“I was the first girl in my family to go to college and finish university. Had it not been for my father, Ismail Soho, this wouldn’t have been possible. A lot of girls in my family went for higher education after I finished my studies,” she recalls.  
The eldest among her siblings — three sisters and a brother — Soho says she has been fearless all her life, thanks to her “enlightened  father”.   
“It was my late father’s decision that I head the Soho baradari,” she says, explaining how her clan is different from the tribes that dominate upper Sindh. “My father was called sardar by the people of our baradari out of love and respect. People looked up to him and he did whatever he could for their well-being,” says Soho.  
Soho entered politics in early 2000s and was elected councillor in the 2001 local bodies elections. Since then, she has gone on to become an MPA four times on reserved seats. “Back then, the graduation clause was in place and the MQM was looking for educated women. My father had been a lifelong jiyala (PPP member), but when it came to entering politics, I opted for MQM and my father supported me.”  
But later, she joined the Pakistan Peoples Party and has been an active member ever since.   
“My next goal is to improve women’s lot in my area and thereby bring about change. Another aim is to hopefully get the party ticket on a general seat in the next elections. I am hopeful [PPP] chairman Bilawal Bhutto will give me this chance,” she says. 
Asked if she faced any resistance after she was picked for her new role, Soho said she had seen little so far. “I had my father’s backing” as well as that of Hafiz Ghulam Muhammad Soho, an influential cleric in Sindh.  
“My father had been grooming me the past few years for this role. I would observe how things were handled in the panchayat” Soho said. So far, she has resolved over a dozen cases in the local panchayat. The issues range from monetary dispute to pending investigation cases with police to domestic violence cases.  
“Now my goal is to get more women join me. I want to make sure that more women become elders and form committees for the well-being of their communities,” she said  
Soho feels the participation of women in all walks of life is unavoidable if a society is to change. “We need to give women a chance. Unlike upper Sindh, our area does not have the issue of Karo Kari. Things are more relaxed for women and you will see them running their own small businesses, managing farms and tending to livestock.  
“There are so many challenges confronting the rural areas of Sindh. Without taking women into account, these can’t be sorted out,” Soho stresses while waiting for restoration of power supply at her house in Gulshan-i-Iqbal.  
‘The men in my life’
Named Heer by her father, Soho says her name is from the Kalam (poetic works) of Shah Latif and means “a gust of cold wind”, clarifying that she was not named after the tragic heroine of Waris Shah’s Heer Ranjha.  
“People say ‘behind every successful man there is a woman’. I have no qualms in saying behind every successful woman there are men. In my case, it was first my father and now my husband. They have given me space to succeed.”  
Soho recalled that she met her husband during a party meeting in Sindh. “He was a zonal in charge of the MQM. He sent a proposal through my chacha (uncle) and my father asked for my opinion,” she says.  
Counting the firsts in her life, Soho says: “I was the first girl in my family to go to university and do her masters. I was also the first woman to enter politics. Last but not the least, I was the first to do pasand ki shaadi (love marriage).”   
In reply to a question about being a woman in the public eye and the expectations of her family and society, Soho —  a mother of three — says after her father, her husband has been very supportive in all her endeavours. Often referring to him as a “fine, well-spoken person”, Soho says: “Had it not been for his support, I would not have been where I am now after shaadi (marriage).  
“I sometimes come home at 3am after attending political events. Sometimes I am away from home. He trusts me and this motivates me.”
As far as society goes, she says that sometimes there is a barb to things people say. “Somehow men feel that women are there to hog the limelight. While some pass snarky remarks, others simply get uncomfortable in the presence of women at political events.”  
“At times, men even say things like “aap ko koi kaam nahi hay ghar par?” (Have you nothing to do at home?). This is a comment many female politicians get to hear. The latest is “Acha tou ab aap sardar bun gayee hay” (I see! You’ve become a tribal chief now). Sometimes I ignore, at other times these comments can hurt you.But then again, I tell myself to focus on the work that I can do for society and don’t let myself get demotivated.  
She acknowledges that being in the public eye means an end to private life. “I can’t post impromptu selfies with family now because I have to be seen in a certain way to be taken seriously. Your private life suffers.  
“At times you end up neglecting family. If your husband isn’t supportive, things can get nasty. Women are always under observation and we have to learn to live with it.”   
Her word of advice to girls and women is to keep pushing and striving for excellence. “You have to make an effort and create space for yourself.   
“Anything that a man can do, a woman can do better. We can adapt ourselves to any situation. That’s how Allah has created the female kind.”

7,Tax amnesty for industries requires more talks with IMF,Finance ministry hopes to take its case to the Fund’s executive board.,"ISLAMABAD: Confirming that the tax amnesty scheme for the industrial sector required ‘further discussions’ with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the finance ministry is hoping to take its case to the Fund’s executive board towards the end of next month. 
In a statement issued here, the ministry said that complete details of the relief package announced by the prime minister, including financing options, had been shared with the IMF and a general understanding had been developed.

9,Senior lawyer questions president’s neutrality over reference,ISLAMABAD: Senior lawyer Abid Hassan Minto on Thursday highlighted before Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata...,"ISLAMABAD: Senior lawyer Abid Hassan Minto on Thursday highlighted before Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial that the president, it appeared, had moved the reference before the Supreme Court on advice and in aid of the political government.
In a letter sent to the CJP, Mr Minto said that in the present reference before the Supreme Court, the president was not merely seeking an advice, he was actually actively canvassing for the lifetime disqualification for defectors by giving an anticipatory opinion or ruling on the matter.
In the letter, the senior lawyer also said that making a reference to the Supreme Court was something the president did on his own, in his discretion, and not on the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet, since the president, as the head of the state, was assumed to be a neutral person.
The letter stated that a general discourse was being built around Article 63-A, positing it as a provision encapsulating some kind of “morality”. It is obvious by now, from the Attorney General of Pakistan’s (AGP) submissions and from the tone of the presidential reference that the Supreme Court was being called upon to advise that voting in contravention of Article 63-A should — at least in some instances — attract lifelong disqualification under Article 62(1f).
The letter requested the CJP to place it before the five-judge larger bench to consider that under Article 63-A, it was not mandatory for a party head to initiate proceedings against those who have defected in terms of that article.

10,Isa’s plea for live coverage sent to CJP,"Justice Munib Akhtar describes application as ""novel"", refers matter to CJP.","ISLAMABAD: Describing  as “novel” an application by Justice Qazi Faez Isa, seeking the public broadcast and live court coverage of his review petition, Justice Munib Akhtar of the Supreme Court referred the matter to the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) for deliberation and appropriate action by a full court. 
The matter was referred in view of the evolving practice of courts around the world and acknowledging the benefits of technology for the justice system, Justice Akhtar observed in the judgement he authored. 
On April 13, 2021, the Supreme Court — by a majority of six to four — dismissed Justice Isa’s application seeking permission for live streaming of the hearing of his review petition. 

Justice Munib Akhtar terms judge’s application ‘novel’

Justice Akhtar observed that technological developments should be monitored and appreciated to ensure that access to justice for litigants is constantly improving. 
Therefore, the court’s dismissal of the application should not be construed as an absolute refusal of public broadcast or live streaming of court proceedings. Instead, it should be understood as an exercise in judicial restraint and caution. 
“We are aware that judicial systems around the world are experimenting with cameras in the courtroom,” Justice Akhtar observed, saying that some courts are regularly broadcasting/live streaming their proceedings while others are participating in pilot projects. The United Kingdom and Canadian supreme courts are in the former category, as they have been permitting live streaming of their cases for long. The state and federal courts of the United States are in the latter category because they are at varying stages in terms of allowing broadcasting of their hearings. 
In view of the judicial system in Pakistan, the judgement says, it appears to be a certain overlap (both technologically and otherwise) between granting permission for hearings through video link and for permitting public broadcast/live streaming of court proceedings. 
The judgement also cites a decision rendered by the Indian supreme court in a similar issue and observes that the Indian court allowed the petition, but emphasised certain issues to be sorted out before such live streaming can be permitted.
