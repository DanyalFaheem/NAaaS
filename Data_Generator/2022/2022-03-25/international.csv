0,Nato will ‘respond’ if Russia uses chemical weapons in Ukraine,"""The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,"" US President Joe Biden says.","BRUSSELS/KYIV: US President Joe Biden said on Thursday that Nato would  “respond” if Russian President Vladimir Putin used a chemical weapon in his war on Ukraine.
“We will respond if he uses it. The nature of the response would depend on the nature of the use,” Biden said after a Nato summit in Brussels.
The United States and allies upped the pressure on Russia over its  invasion of Ukraine at summits in Brussels Thursday, warning Moscow its  costs will keep rising the longer the war continues.
Washington  unveiled fresh sanctions on Russian lawmakers and defence contractors,  and outlined a push by the G7 to freeze Russia out of international  organisations and to cut it off from its gold reserves.
US  President Joe Biden was the central figure of the summits, which  gathered, in succession, the 30 Nato member countries, the G7 powers and  then the EU’s 27-nation bloc.
Ukraine President Volodymyr  Zelensky also participated by videolink. He pleaded with NATO leaders to  send his forces weapons  “without restrictions”.
“The alliance  can still prevent the deaths of Ukrainians from Russian strikes, from  Russian occupation, by giving us all the weapons we need,” he said.
Kyiv, Moscow exchange prisoners
Russia  and Ukraine have exchanged prisoners, Kyiv and Moscow confirmed  on Thursday, in what Ukraine said was the first swap of soldiers since  Moscow ordered troops into Ukraine one month ago.
“Following an  order from President Volodymyr Zelensky, the first fully-fledged  exchange of prisoners of war has taken place,” Ukrainian Vice Prime  Minister Iryna Vereshchuk wrote on Facebook.
“In exchange for 10 captured occupiers we rescued 10 of our servicemen,” she said, referring to Russian and Ukrainian troops.
Vereshchuk  also said that 11 Russian civilian seamen rescued near the Black Sea  port city of Odessa were exchanged for 19 Ukrainian civilian ship crew  members held by Moscow.
“I confirm the information regarding the  exchange of 10 Russian servicemen detained on Ukrainian territory for 10  Ukrainian servicemen. And there was also an exchange of Russian  civilian sailors for Ukrainian civilian sailors”, said Russian human  rights ombudsman Tatiana Moskalkova.
Russia’s foreign ministry  said earlier this week that Moscow had completed two prisoner swaps  since it launched its invasion of Ukraine late last month.
Moskalkova  said nine Russian prisoners were exchanged for the mayor of Melitopol, a  city in southeastern Ukraine captured by the Russian army. Vereshchuk on Wednesday confirmed the Melitopol swap but denied any others had taken place.
UNGA demands end of war
The UN General Assembly on Thursday adopted by an overwhelming  majority a new non-binding resolution that demands an  “immediate” halt  to Russia’s war in Ukraine.
At UN headquarters in New York, 140  countries voted in favour, 38 abstained and five voted against the  measure, with applause ringing out afterwards.
The vote came after  the adoption of a similar non-binding resolution on March 2 that  demanded Russia immediately cease its use of force — a vote that was  approved by 141 countries.
On Wednesday Ukraine put forward the  new resolution, originally prepared by France and Mexico, at an  emergency session of the General Assembly.
A competing text by  South Africa, which never mentioned Russia by name, received only 50  votes for, 67 against and 36 abstentions, and was therefore not adopted.
The  approved resolution specifically implicates Moscow and  “demands an  immediate cessation of the hostilities by the Russian Federation against  Ukraine, in particular of any attacks against civilians and civilian  objects.” 
The same five countries voted against the resolution on Thursday  and March 2 — Russia, Syria, North Korea, Belarus and Eritrea.
The  US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, welcomed the  “strong  majority” of member states that approved the resolution.
The  countries made clear that  “Russia bears sole responsibility for the  grave humanitarian crisis and violence in Ukraine,” she said.

1,Twin attacks in Somalia kill 48 ahead of vote,"MOGADISHU: The death toll from twin attacks in central Somalia has climbed to 48, the leader of Hirshabelle state...","MOGADISHU: The death toll from twin attacks in central Somalia has climbed to 48, the leader of Hirshabelle state said on Thursday, with Al Shabaab insurgents claiming they were targeting politicians ahead of elections.
The first attack in Hirshabelle’s Beledweyne district was carried out on Wednesday night by a suicide bomber, and killed two local lawmakers including Amina Mohamed Abdi and several of her guards as she campaigned for re-election.
Minutes later, a car bomb exploded outside Beledweyne’s main hospital where the injured were being taken for treatment, killing dozens, causing buildings to collapse and leaving vehicles in charred, twisted ruins.
“As far as we can confirm, 48 people were killed and 108 others injured in the twin blasts,” said Ali Gudlawe Hussein, leader of Hirsh­abe­lle state, adding that emergency workers had found bodies buried under debris. “We are urging (citizens) to be very vigilant, we are ordering all security agencies to beef up security,” he said. Earlier on Thursday, the Beled­weyne district police chief said that the attacks had killed over 30 people.
“The terrorists carried out the first attack using a suicide bomber and readied a car loaded with explosives in front of a hospital to cause more casualties,” said Colonel Isak Ali Abdulle. “These were devastating simultaneous attacks which damaged property as well as causing mass civilian casualties.” The bombings occurred the same day as three people were killed in a separate attack near Mogadishu’s airport that was also claimed by Al Shabaab.

2,Chinese FM may seek revival of India border talks,His visit to Delhi has been kept under wraps evidently amid differences over the agenda and scheduling issues.,"NEW DELHI: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi arrived in Delhi on Thursday, the highest-ranking visit from Beijing two years after their troops engaged in a brutal clash over the region of Ladakh although no shot was fired.  
Mr Wang arrived in Delhi from a short visit to Kabul, reports said, and a day after India’s Ministry of External Affairs slammed his comments at the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Pakistan, where he referred to “sharing hopes for Kashmir”.
The Indian reaction however seems to have not deterred the visit amidst deep tensions between both countries on a large number of other issues, and in the backdrop of the raging conflict in Ukraine.
Mr Wang arrived officially unannounced and reports could only cite the Chinese embassy as confirming that he was indeed in Delhi.  The visit has been kept under wraps evidently amid differences over the agenda and scheduling issues during a busy time in New Delhi. 
Reports said a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi is still “under discussion”. The Ministry of External Affairs made no formal comment on the visit thus far. Asked on Wednesday, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told reporters, “I have no information to offer at this moment.”
The decision to host Mr Wang in Delhi is being seen as a departure from the government position thus far that normalcy in the relationship can only follow a complete de–escalation and disengagement at the LAC (Line of Actual Control).
India, according to local reports, has made it clear that the unresolved LAC crisis remains the most important issue on the agenda, to the exclusion of all others, with some hoping that the ministerial–level talks will jumpstart the disengagement process that has been stalled. 
The 15th round of military-level talks between the two sides, on March 11, failed to achieve a breakthrough though both sides said the talks were positive.
Both sides have differed on the way forward in disengagement. India has said normalcy is not possible without peace on the LAC, while China has called for the border to be put in an ‘appropriate’ place and not dominate the relationship, a message that Mr Wang is likely to repeat in New Delhi. China is also expected to bring into focus the Russia-Nato standoff over Ukraine.
Hu Shisheng, Director of the Institute of South Asian Studies at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told The Hindu that it was “time for us two giants to do something out of the box”. “India’s stand is very similar with China’s. Both China and India don’t want to see a much weakened, isolated Russia, which means a more vulnerable regional and global order. We have stakes in a stable and not so isolated Russia, and we need to see what we two can do for ending this crisis”.

3,‘Spain’s former king doesn’t  have immunity’,"MADRID: A British court ruled on Thursday that royal immunity laws do not protect Spain’s former king, Juan Carlos...","MADRID: A British court ruled on Thursday that royal immunity laws do not protect Spain’s former king, Juan Carlos I, in a lawsuit for alleged harassment filed by his ex-lover.
High Court Justice Matthew Nicklin said that because the claim involves Juan Carlos’ private acts in the aftermath of a romantic relationship, he does not have legal immunity under either Spanish or British law.
Corinna Larsen, a Danish socialite and businesswoman who lives in Monaco and London, was the unofficial partner of Juan Carlos for years, but the couple split amid increased media and public scrutiny in Spain. Juan Carlos stepped down as king in 2014, allowing his son to become King Felipe VI.
In 2020, after Larsen and Juan Carlos became subjects of judicial investigations for opaque financial dealings, including assets kept in tax havens, she sued the former monarch, accusing him of allegedly orchestrating threats and ordering unlawful covert and overt surveillance starting in 2012.

4,"Number of illegal crossings at EU’s borders rises to 27,000","Highest number of illegal crossings registered on Western Balkan route, totalling 11,700 in January and February.","ISLAMABAD: The number of illegal border crossings at EU’s external borders in the first two months of 2022 rose by 61 per cent from a year ago to nearly 27 000, according to preliminary calculations released by the European Union.
There were 11,850 detections of illegal border crossings in February, about a quarter more than in the same month of 2021, EU says in a press release which was made available on Thursday.
The total does not include the people who have been fleeing Ukraine since the country was invaded by Russia in late February.
The highest number of illegal crossings was registered on the Western Balkan route, totalling 11, 700 in January and February. This was double the figure from the same period of last year. In February, nearly 5 700 irregular migrants were detected on this route. Syrians and Afghans were the two main nationalities registered on this route in the first two months of 2022.

Pakistanis among those who accounted for most detections on this route

The second most active migratory route into the EU was the Western African Route, which leads to Spain’s Canary Islands. There, more than 5,400 illegal crossings have been detected so far this year, more than double from a year ago.
In February, which had not usually seen large numbers of arrivals due to winter weather conditions, the number of irregular migrants reaching the Canary Islands rose almost eight-fold to around 2,300. Moroccans accounted for more than half of the arrivals on this route, followed by nationals of Guinea and Senegal.
The number of illegal border crossings detected in the Eastern Medite­rranean Route also more than doubled to 3,500. Cyprus accounted for over 2,700 detections. In Febr­uary, there were more than 1,500 irregular migrants registered on this route.
Nationals of Congo, Nigeria, Pakistan, Syria and Bangladesh accounted for most of the detections on this route.
Meanwhile, the Central Mediterranean route saw a small drop in the number of illegal crossings in the first two months of the year to 4,500, with nearly 1500 irregular migrants detected in February. 
The main nationalities on this route were Bangladeshi, Egyptian and Tunisian.
The Western Mediterranean route was the least active sea route in the first two months of 2022, registering a rise of 8pc to less than 1,800 illegal crossings. Of these, slightly more than 700 were recorded in February. 
Algerians and Moroccans accounted for nearly all of the migrants registered on this route.
There were some 340 illegal border crossings detected on this route in the first two months of the year, nearly three times the total from a year ago. The figure does not include the people fleeing the war in Ukraine.
More than 3,100 irregular migrants were detected seeking to cross the Channel towards the UK so far this year, double the number from a year ago. In February, poor weather curtailed the number of departures to some 600.

6,"Drones, thermal scanners scour China crash site",Officials are still yet to declare all of the 123 passengers and nine crew dead.,"WUZHOU: Recovery teams deployed drones and thermal imaging equipment on Thursday across a mountainous area where a China Eastern plane inexplicably crashed with 132 people on board.
Four days after flight MU5735 ploughed into rugged terrain near Wuzhou in southern China, officials are still yet to declare all of the 123 passengers and nine crew dead.
More human remains have been found, officials confirmed on Thursday, but the velocity of a crash which punched a crater into the muddy ground and scattered plane parts and passenger belongings across a wide area, has complicated recovery work.
“Most of the aircraft wreckage is concentrated in a core area within a radius of about 30 metres from the main impact point,” Zhu Tao of China’s aviation authority told reporters.
“The depth extends down from the surface to about 20 metres.” Monday’s crash is almost certainly China’s worst air disaster in three decades and President Xi Jinping was swift to order a full investigation into what happened.
Wiping tears from her eyes, her arms supported by two men, a distraught relative arrived at the entrance point to the crash area on Thursday morning, according to a reporter.
Under pouring rain, she joined scores of firefighters, paramilitary police and reporters to trudge across the rough terrain to where eviscerated chunks of jet have been found — the result of the plane’s as-yet-unexplained nosedive to the ground.
Hundreds of relatives of victims have arrived in the southern Chinese city, awaiting confirmation of their worst fears. Despite the odds, searchers on Thursday were yet to rule out finding people trapped on the densely forested, mud-slicked slopes.
The  “mission is mainly focused on searching for victims and saving lives”, Huang Shangwu, of Guangxi Fire and Rescue Force, told reporters, citing instructions  “from headquarters”.
“We are using thermal imagers and life detectors to search the surface...we also use manual searches and aerial drones.” At the same time, teams are scouring the landscape for the remaining black box — after a damaged voice recorder was recovered on Wednesday and sent to Beijing for analysis.
Experts hope it will yield clues to the cause of the crash, which saw the Boeing plane — flying between Kunming and Guangzhou — drop tens of thousands of feet in just minutes. State broadcaster CCTV showed rescuers lifting what appeared to be a chunk of the aeroplane’s wing as they expanded the search area.
Pieces of engine are also among the wreckage recovered, according to state news agency Xinhua.
Tracking website FlightRadar24 showed the plane rapidly dropped from an altitude of 29,100 to 7,850 feet (about 8,900 to 2,400 metres) in just over a minute.
The stricken jet was equipped with two recorders: the cockpit voice recorder and the other one in the rear passenger cabin tracking flight data.
Safety probe
Aviation authorities have vowed an extensive two-week check-up of China’s vast passenger fleet. China Eastern also confirmed at a Thursday press conference that it had grounded all 223 of its Boeing 737-800 aeroplanes for safety checks, as the airline launches a safety overhaul following the crash.
The safety message has rippled out across sectors. A notice from the State Council and Ministry of Emergency Management on Wednesday called for industries across the board to  “rectify potential safety hazards”.

7,"US, UN to Taliban: no recognition, no support without girls’ education",UN chief says decision jeopardises the country’s future in view of the tremendous contributions by Afghan women and girls.,"WASHINGTON: The United States and the United Nations warned Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers on Thursday that the failure to reopen girls’ schools could hurt their efforts to get international recognition and rebuild the Afghan economy.
The Taliban had announced earlier that high schools in Afghanistan will open their doors to girls on Wednesday but later reversed their decision until it’s decided what would be an appropriate uniform for girls.
This decision by the Taliban, if it is not swiftly reversed, will profoundly harm the Afghan people, the country’s prospects for economic growth, and the Taliban’s ambition to improve their relations with the international community,” warned US Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken.
In New York, UN Secretary general António Guterres said that the Taliban’s decision “not only violates the equal rights of women and girls to education, but it also jeopardises the country’s future in view of the tremendous contributions by Afghan women and girls.”
The Taliban’s ambassador-designate to the United Nations Suhail Shaheen, however, assured the international community that this was only a “technical delay.”
“There is no issue of banning girls from schools,” he said in an interview to America’s National Public Radio “It is only a technical issue of deciding on the form of school uniform for girls.”
But Secretary Blinken reminded the Taliban rulers that education was a human right, and the United States “rejects the Taliban’s excuses for reversing their commitment to the people of Afghanistan” to reopen girls’ schools on Wednesday.
He noted that many girls and women were returning to secondary classrooms across the country but were told to go home until further notice.
“We stand with Afghan girls and their families, who see education as a path to realizing the full potential of Afghanistan’s society and economy,” Secretary Blinken said in a statement issued by his office.
The UN chief said he “deeply regrets” the decision and reminded the Taliban that the start of the new school year had been eagerly anticipated by all students, girls and boys, and parents and families.
“The de facto authorities’ failure to reopen schools for girls above the sixth grade, despite repeated commitments, is a profound disappointment and deeply damaging for Afghanistan,” Mr. Guterres said. “I urged the Taliban de facto authorities to open schools for all students without any further delay.”
UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet recalled her recent visit to Kabul, where women stressed to her that they wanted to speak to the Taliban themselves.
She said in a statement that “disempowering half of Afghanistan’s population is counterproductive and unjust.” Such “structural discrimination,” she said, such was also deeply damaging for the country’s prospects of future recovery and development.”
The Executive Director of the UN Children’s Fund, Catherine Russell, also issued a statement saying that the decision meant an entire generation of adolescent girls was being “denied their right to an education and…robbed of the opportunity to gain the skills they need to build their futures.”
While statements by UN officials strongly condemned the Taliban, it’s the US reaction that would be a cause for concern for Kabul’s de facto rulers.

8,US Supreme Court pick Jackson edges closer to confirmation,Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to support the nomination,"WASHINGTON: Ketanji Brown Jackson, President Joe Biden’s US Supreme Court nominee, on Thursday moved closer to securing Senate confirmation in the next two weeks, while experts from the nation’s leading lawyers’ group dismissed Republican claims that she was  “soft on crime” including child pornography.
As the Senate Judiciary Committee held the fourth and final day of Jackson’s confirmation hearing, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said the chamber was  “on track” to confirm the federal appellate judge to the lifetime job before its expected break for Easter on April 8.
There is no sign that the Republican attacks mounted this week are likely to derail Jackson’s confirmation, with Biden’s fellow Democrats narrowly controlling the Senate. With a simple majority needed for confirmation and the Senate divided 50-50 between the parties, she would get the job if Democrats remain united regardless of how the Republicans vote.
It is possible she could pick up a small number of Republican votes, most likely Senator Lisa Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell refuses to support the nomination

But Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he cannot support Jackson’s nomination.
McConnell made the statement on the floor as the Senate’s judiciary committee.
Following liberal Justice Stephen Breyer’s January announcement of his plan to return, Biden nominated Jackson in February to become the first Black woman to serve on the nation’s top judicial body. The committee is likely vote on April 4 on sending her nomination to the full Senate for a final confirmation vote.
Jackson concluded two days of marathon testimony on Wednesday night, facing repeated attacks by several Republicans who accused her of being lenient in her previous role as a federal trial court judge in sentencing child pornography offenders. “Some of the attacks on this judge were unfair, unrelenting and beneath the dignity of the United States Senate,” said Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, the committee’s chairman.
“My lasting impression,” Durbin added,  “is of a judge who sat there through it all, head held high, with dignity and determination and strength.”  The most hostile questioning came from Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, Marsha Blackburn and Lindsey Graham.
Schumer described the Republican attacks as an attempt by  “just a handful” of senators to  “smear” Jackson with misleading and false accusations.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday criticised Jackson on the Senate floor, accusing her of deflecting basic questions about her judicial philosophy and declining to answer legitimate questions about her own rulings. McConnell also faulted Jackson after she refused — as current Justice Amy Coney Barrett did in her 2020 confirmation hearing — to weigh in on proposals from the left to expand the number of justices to erase the court’s current 6-3 conservative majority. “This made up an endless circle of evasion,” McConnell said.
Jackson’s confirmation would not change the court’s ideological balance but would let Biden freshen its liberal bloc with a 51-year-old jurist young enough to serve for decades.
The committee heard from outside witnesses testifying about Jackson’s record and qualifications, including members of the American Bar Association.

9,North Korea fires new ICBM in largest test since 2017,"Japanese PM says Pyongyang is threatening “the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community"".","SEOUL: North Korea fired a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Thursday, Tokyo and Seoul said as they voiced outrage at Pyongyang’s most powerful launch since 2017.
The missile was fired on Thursday afternoon from Sunan — likely the same site as a failed test last week — and had a range of 6,200 kilometers (3,850 miles), Seoul’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said. 
The missile flew for 71 minutes and landed in Japan’s territorial waters, according to the Japanese government.
Nuclear-armed North Korea has long coveted an ICBM that can carry multiple warheads and, the US and South Korea say, has been testing the Hwasong-17, a giant ICBM first unveiled in October 2020. 
Despite biting international sanctions over its weapons programs, Pyongyang has doubled-down on Kim’s drive to modernise the military, and last week test-fired what analysts said was likely the Hwasong-17. 
That launch ended in failure, exploding mid-air in the skies above the capital. 
“Pyongyang attempted to fire an ICBM at the Sunan airport last week but failed,” said Go Myong-hyun, senior researcher at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies. 
“So it carried out today’s launch to make up for that failure and because it has to complete the ICBM technology right away,” he told AFP. 
The moratorium was “virtually scrapped” anyway, Go said, when North Korea conducted two tests for what it called a “reconnaissance satellite”. 
“What is also key is whether Pyongyang will make today’s launch official,” he added.
It is worth noting that North Korea will mark the 110th anniversary of the birth of founder Kim Il Sung on April 15, and analysts predict Pyongyang will conduct an ICBM or satellite launch as part of the celebrations. 
“Kim Jong Un feels it’s very important to prove his leadership’s competency before the 110th birthday anniversary of Kim Il Sung, especially to his own people in North Korea,” said Cheong Seong-chang of the Center for North Korea Studies at the Sejong Institute.
The reaction to the launch was swift: South Korea’s military said it had fired a barrage of missiles in response to North Korea’s test of a new ICBM, while Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Pyongyang was threatening “the peace and safety of Japan, the region and the international community,” adding, “this cannot be accepted”.
Washington also strongly condemned the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea for its test of a long-range ballistic missile, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement.

10,Queen Elizabeth may miss opening of parliament,"As head of state, Queen Elizabeth has opened parliament all but twice during her record-breaking 70-year reign.","LONDON: The UK government on Thursday said the traditional State Opening of Parliament will take place in May, raising questions about whether Queen Elizabeth II will attend.
The monarch, who turns 96 next month, lays out her government’s legislative programme in a speech from a gilded throne in the House of Lords, in a ceremony filled with pomp and pageantry.
As head of state, she has opened parliament all but twice during her record-breaking 70-year reign, missing the event in 1959 and 1963 while pregnant with princes Andrew and Edward. But she has been in fragile health since she spent an unscheduled night in hospital last October, and has cut back on engagements on doctor’s orders, including recently when she had a bout of Covid.
Buckingham Palace said only that her  “attendance will be confirmed in due course”, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office said the Queen’s Speech will take place on May 10.
The queen has largely limited her duties to meetings with foreign diplomats and pulled out of the Commonwealth Day service earlier this month, which was to have been her return to a major public event.
All eyes are now on whether she will attend the memorial service at Westminster Abbey next on Tuesday for her late husband, Prince Philip, who died in April last year, aged 99. Royal officials announced on Thursday that members of the royal family will be joined by more than 30 foreign royals and the Duke of Edinburgh’s wider family and friends, plus 500 representatives from charities he represented.
The queen, who was married to Philip for 73 years, is said to want to attend, given his funeral was held under coronavirus restrictions with just 30 mourners.
But again, there has been no confirmation that she will be present at the service, where some 1,800 guests will pay tribute to his life.
