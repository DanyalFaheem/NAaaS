“Usman Buzdar has removed the official record from the Chief Minister House and shifted it to an unidentified place,” Ms Bokhari said in a statement here on Thursday.  
She said if Buzdar had not removed the official record why he deleted the video footage of the Chief Minister’s House in this regard. She alleged that Usman Buzdar had become a billionaire through corruption and he had made benami properties for which he would be made accountable.

Ms Bokhari predicted Buzdar would soon be finding a new party to join like his other party members.  
On the other hand, the Punjab government has termed the PML-N’s allegations rubbish. 
Earlier, the Punjab government had dismissed reports that Mr Buzdar had directed the department concerned to prepare a summary for enhancing the perks and privileges for ‘former’ chief ministers.  
Meanwhile, PML-N leaders Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz will address the party workers at Model Town on Friday (today) to prepare the workers for the party’s long march starting from Lahore on Saturday.

1,More Lesco consumers get notices for ‘illegal’ structures,"A total of 1,491 people have been asked so far to raze shades close to wires.","LAHORE: The Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) has issued notices to 841 more people for ‘illegally’ constructing houses and buildings for various uses under the high voltage power transmission and distribution lines emanating from the grid stations.  
Earlier to this, the company had issued notices to 650 people in Lahore and other districts -- Kasur, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib -- to demolish such constructions. 
“The notices are being issued keeping in view the occurrence of fatal/non-fatal accidents at such places. So far notices have been issued to 1,491 people by the respective Lesco authorities,” said Lesco Chief Executive Officer Chaudhry Muhammad Amin while presiding over a meeting here on Thursday. 
It merits mentioning that the notices being issued by the company are not limited to construction of houses/buildings under the lines but to those as well who had encroached upon the land either by extending their buildings’ shades close to wires or taking their structures’ height to a level close to the lines. 

A total of 1,491 people have been asked so far to raze shades close to wires  

Some of the people had also approached National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), urging it to stop Lesco from taking any further action against their constructions (houses etc). The company, in a response to Nepra, said the removal of high voltage transmission lines from the ‘existing right of way’ and shifting them to other places is not possible since it costs huge money. 
The Lesco chief said the company’s respective departments have also removed several system constraints in a bid to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the consumers during Ramazan. 
“We have created and energised 50 new 11kV feeders, carried out maintenance at 2,307km of the total 3,110km long 132kV transmission lines, trimming of trees and addition of new transformers and other equipment at grid stations,” he claimed.

Meanwhile, the chief minister said it would be a waste of time if he would respond to baseless accusations. He said impeding development and political chaos was the main agenda of the propagandists.
In meetings with parliamentarians, he discussed matters pertaining to mutual interest, progress on development schemes in their respective constituencies and political situation.

He emphasized that the rally would prove to be the last nail in the coffin of the opposition’s negative politics. He deplored horse-trading tactics on the part of the opposition, saying that the PTI believed in displaying courtesy and patience in politics and denounced that the opponents had promoted a wrong political culture in the country by indulging in politics of doing criticism for the sake of criticism.
Those who met the chief minister included provincial ministers Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, Murad Ras, Akhtar Malik, Jehanzeb Khichi, Sardar Asif Nakai, and Rai Taimoor Bhatti, and MNAs and MPAs Sardar Muhammad Khan Leghari, Aurangzeb Khichi, Chaudhry Tahir Iqbal, Faizullah Kamoka, Raja Yawar Kamal Khan, Taimoor Lali, Waris Aziz, Wasif Mazharan, Saleem Akhtar and others.

Several major and minor roads of  the area including patches of the Lower and Upper Mall had been closed  for the last three weeks. On Thursday, the impact of the traffic  mess increased to other parts of the city such as Jail Road, Mall  Road, Davies Road and adjoining arteries which remained choked the whole  day through.  
Some eyewitnesses and local residents said the  traffic mess was a matter of concern forcing people to stay  indoors. They said people were facing inconvenience due to  traffic blockages.  

First round of negotiation remains inconclusive  

Multan Road, Lytton Road, Jain Mandir, roads near MAO College, Istanbul Chowk, Outfall Road  and Anarkali market too had unusual traffic. The situation is quite problematic for the residents of Islampura which is one of the most  populated localities of the city.  
The government employees and  students also face difficulty in reaching their destinations.  
The Civil  Secretariat houses 43 government departments and the officers and other  employees are bearing the brunt of the agitation. The Town Hall has also  become inaccessible for the employees and the visitors due to  the traffic mess. The lawyers, judges and visitors also are disturbed.   
Some protesting teachers said nearly 400 government teachers had lodged  protest in the area on  the first day of the agitation and the number had swelled and they were determined to  pleading their case with vigour.  
Hundreds  of college teachers are holding their sit-in outside Civil  Secretariat to demand regularisation of jobs along  with pay protection. They have blocked the road on both sides to protest  against the government for delay in acceptance of their demands including pay  and service protection of 7,000 teachers. The teachers are also  boycotting the classes in all colleges of the province from 10am to 11am  daily.

8,Call for giving constitutional cover to local govts,No opposition representative included in consultation,"LAHORE: Participants in a consultation here on Thursday stressed the need for giving a constitutional cover to the role, term and responsibilities of local governments in the country.  
They said that unless the constitution defines the role of the third tier of local governments much like the role, domain and duration of national and provincial governments, various governments will continue to undermine the crucial third tier of local governance.  
This consensus developed at a consultative forum organised by Pildat in collaboration with the UNDP.  
The participants also expressed their concern at the delay in the enactment of the local government law by the Punjab Assembly as the Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2021 (PLGO 2021), after an extension of 90 days, is set to expire on June 10, 2022. Unless it is passed by the Punjab Assembly, holding of local government elections in the province might not be possible.  

No opposition representative included in consultation

Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Director Elections Abdul Hameed said the election authority had concluded the process of delimitation in Punjab for holding local government polls.  
Since independent candidates can contest LG elections only after registering themselves as an electoral group, the ECP has begun the enlistment process which will be concluded by March 28, he added.  
He also shared that they had proposed a number of amendments to the Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2021 (PLGO 2021) to the provincial government though there is no progress so far.  
UNDP’s Qasim Janjua said they had been working with national and provincial governments to strengthen effective and accountable democratic governance.  
PILDAT Joint Director Aasiya Riaz shared a comparative analysis of the local government systems in place in the four provinces. She underscored that the system of democratic governance remains incomplete without an effective third tier of local governments.  
No PML-N and PPP representatives were included in the consultation. The MPAs who joined the forum included Mussarat Jamshed (PTI) and Khadija Umer (PML-Q).  
Representatives of political parties included Rizwan Mumtaz (PML-Q) and Syed Muhammad Agha Raza, ex-MPA (Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen).
