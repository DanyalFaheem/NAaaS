CHRISTCHURCH: Defending champions England continued their Women’s Cricket World Cup resurgence with an emphatic nine-wicket win over Pakistan Thursday to stand on the brink of the semi-finals.
England pace bowler Katherine Brunt roared back into form after an indifferent tournament, taking 3-17 as she and Sophie Ecclestone helped bundle Pakistan out for 105 in Christchurch.
Brunt had taken only one wicket in five previous matches at this year’s one-day showcase but formed a potent attack with Ecclestone, who took 3-18.
Danni Wyatt then shook off her own tentative start to the tournament, smashing an unbeaten 76 to see England home.
The result moves England into the top four at the expense of India on a better net run rate and they can confirm a place in the semi-finals with victory over Bangladesh on Sunday.
Captain Heather Knight said the 2017 champions were building momentum after making a disastrous start to the tournament with three straight losses.
“It’s about reminding the girls that it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish,” she said.
“We’re not there yet and we’ve got a big game coming up against Bangladesh.” 
England made the perfect start after putting Pakistan into bat when Brunt dismissed opener Nahida Khan with the first ball of the innings, coaxing an outside edge that went straight to first slip.
Pakistan captain Bismah Maroof then threw away her wicket when she was run out for nine trying to sneak a second run to square leg.
The run rate slowed to a crawl and Pakistan were 33-3 when Omaima Sohail was also run out on 11 with a direct hit from Tammy Beaumont.
Sidra Ameen tried to rebuild but was bowled for 32 and Sidra Nawaz was the only other batter to offer resistance, making 23 as Pakistan were bowled out for 105 in 41.3 overs.
Bismah said Pakistan’s batting was too tentative and they need to adopt a more positive approach.
“We need to believe in ourselves, that’s important,” she said.
”We have hitters who can play shots but you have to back yourself and apply yourself in the middle.” 
SOUTH AFRICA MAKE SEMIS
Rain meant play was abandoned in Thursday’s other scheduled match between South Africa and the West Indies in Wellington, with South Africa advancing to the semi-finals after each side received one point.
The “no result” lifted West Indies to third in the table on seven points after completing their group matches, but they will have to rely on other results to remain in the top four and make the semi-finals.
England and India, fourth and fifth in the standings, can both overtake the West Indies by winning their final matches on Sunday, against Bangladesh and South Africa respectively.
A downpour delayed the start of the match in the New Zealand capital for more than four hours, then officials attempted to proceed with innings of 26 overs apiece.
But that was scrapped after 10.5 overs with South Africa 61-4 and looking to rebuild with Mignon du Preez unbeaten on 38 from 31 balls.
Chinelle Henry took 3-19 and West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor felt they were on top when play was called off.
“It’s not the way we’d like (the match to end) but you can’t do much about God’s plan, it’s something we can’t control,” she said.
South Africa captain Sune Luus said her players were “pumped” at having the chance to make the final for the first time after semi appearances in 2000 and 2017. 
“Everyone’s extremely excited and obviously very happy to be in the semi-finals,” she said.
Summarised scores: 
PAKISTAN 105 in 41.3 overs (Sidra Ameen 32, Sidra Nawaz 23; K. Brunt 3-17, S. Ecclestone 3-18); ENGLAND 107-1 in 19.2 overs (D. Wyatt 76 not out, H. Knight 24; Diana Baig 1-14).

Bangladesh defeated hosts South Africa by nine wickets at Centurion Park on Wednesday to win a three-match series 2-1.
The victory consolidates their position at the top of the ICC ODI super league table, putting them in strong contention to qualify for the 2023 World Cup.
Bangladesh’s first ODI series win against a major nation was splashed across almost every national newspaper, with the Dhaka Tribune running the headline:  “Tigers create history in land of lions”.
“This series win in a previously unconquered land should be recognised as Bangladesh’s best success in ODI history,” veteran cricket writer Utpal Shuvro wrote in the mass-circulation daily Prothom Alo.
India took 26 years and five series to register their first ODI series win in South Africa and Pakistan won on their fourth attempt.
Bangladesh won the first match at Centurion by 38 runs and before losing the second by seven wickets.
In the decider, the Tigers bowled out South Africa for 154 runs before racing to 156-1 in just 26.3 overs.
Pace bowler Taskin Ahmed, who took 5-35 and was named both the player of the match and of the series, was hailed as a hero.
Bangladesh are also looking good in Tests, having won their first five-day game against New Zealand in January.
Bangladesh will now play a two-Test series against South Africa, starting in Durban on March 31.

2,Pakistan openers set up gripping final day after Australia’s bold declaration,"LAHORE: It could’ve been a turning point for Australia, providing them with the breakthrough they so badly needed....","LAHORE: It could’ve been a turning point for Australia, providing them with the breakthrough they so badly needed. Fortunately for Pakistan, though, Steve Smith isn’t having the best of times as a fielder. 
A sporting declaration earlier in the day by Pat Cummins had set Pakistan a target of 351 in their fourth innings but Australia’s hopes of rattling the hosts early on in their chase were snuffed out by openers Imam-ul-Haq and Abdullah Shafique. The moment they’d waited for came on the penultimate delivery of the penultimate day of the series-deciding third Test at the Gaddafi Stadium. 
Trying to induce Abdullah into driving, part-timer Marnus Labuschagne lobbed a full delivery which was edged to slip by the right-hander. Leaning to his right and unable to shift his weight to his left in time, the ball slipped through Smith’s fingers to the boundary. A missed chance for the tourists saw the hosts breathe a huge sigh of relief. 
A wicket there would’ve meant Australia would’ve gone into final day with their tails up, having broken Pakistan’s resolute opening stand and a new batter to bowl to on Friday. Instead, it means Pakistan will have the psychological advantage of having all their wickets, needing 278 more runs for victory after they were 73-0 at the close of play on Thursday with Imam on 42 and Abdullah on 27.

The climax to Australia’s first series in Pakistan after nearly 24 years couldn’t have been scripted better. 
“We batted really well today,” Pakistan batting coach Mohammad Yousuf said during an online news conference after the day’s play. “We hope to continue this way for the next three sessions tomorrow and we will try our best to win the match. 
“We have played daring cricket. Our batters came out of the crease while also showed good defence. Tomorrow, we will play according to the required situation.” 
Yousuf added that Pakistan’s valiant batting performance in the second Test in Karachi, where the hosts grabbed a thrilling draw, had given the side the confidence to go for a win on Friday. 
“I think our batters will live up to the expectations and come out with a victory,” he said, while terming Cummins’ decision to declare at 227-3 a “bold and brave decision which is good for Test cricket.” 
Cummins declared just four overs after tea, and after Australia’s Pakistan-born opener Usman Khawaja had completed his second century of the series. 
Khawaja, who missed out on a century by nine runs in the first innings, got to the three-figure mark in the over before tea and finished with 104. The 35-year-old said it was a timely declaration by his captain. 
“Personally, I think we declared at the right time,” Khawaja told reporters in an online news conference. “I am always of the belief that you want to leave yourself more time and not run out of time rather than trying to be too worried about them scoring the runs. 
“They started well today but it is not easy out there. They have to do it again for the whole 90 overs on a day five wicket which I feel is tougher than the one in Karachi. If we do everything right tomorrow we could be right in to win this match.” 
Khawaja had been cleaned up by speedster Naseem Shah when on 31 but the television umpire ruled that the 19-year-old had overstepped the crase. 
He shared a 96-run opening stand with David Warner (51), who hit six fours and a six before Shaheen Shah Afridi sent his off-stump cart-wheeling in the penultimate over before lunch. 
Khawaja then put on a brisk 65 with Labuschagne (36), who was dropped on 11 off Sajid Khan before being caught at deep midwicket off left-arm spinner Nauman Ali. 
Vice-captain Smith became the fastest batter to cross the 8000-run mark in Test cricket but perished for 17 when Naseem had him caught behind. 
Khawaja completed his 12th Test century and Travis Head hit Nauman for a six and four before the declaration came. 
Pakistan started confidently even though Imam and Abdullah survived television referrals against off-spinner Nathan Lyon as Australia probed for the vital breakthrough. It would’ve changed the spectre of the contest heading into the final day but when the chance came, Smith wasn’t up to it.

4,Root out for duck as England stutter against West Indies,"Root’s quick departure after nine balls is the 11th duck of his career, and his first against West Indies.","

WEST Indies pacer Kyle Mayers celebrates dismissing England captain Joe Root during the third Test at the National Cricket Stadium on Thursday.—Reuters

 
ST GEORGE’S: West Indies claimed the prized wicket of Joe Root for a duck as England slumped to 46 for three at lunch on the opening day of the third and deciding Test in the Caribbean series on Thursday.
Pace bowling all-rounder Kyle Mayers quickly justified his inclusion after being picked for the first time in the series on a lively pitch.
He took the first two wickets without conceding a single run, getting opener Zak Crawley caught at short cover for seven, before Root was caught-behind by a delivery that moved just enough off the pitch to nick the edge of the bat.
“It was a good spell,” said an understated Mayers, who had 2-0 off five maiden overs at lunch.
“I tried to stick to length, just staying patient. The ball’s actually seeming around in the air and off the wicket, (which is a) bit slow, but once you get the ball fuller than normal you’re in business.”  
Root’s quick departure after nine balls was the 11th duck of his career, and his first against West Indies.
The exit of England’s best batter was almost enough on its own to justify the decision by West Indies captain Kraigg Brathwaite to send England in upon winning the toss.
But when Jayden Seales trapped Dan Lawrence lbw for eight just before lunch, the call was surely vindicated.
Mayers’ inclusion in place of spinner Veerasammy Permaul afforded West Indies a five-pronged pace attack.
The bowlers got enough late movement to beat the bat occasionally, but opener Alex Lees showed good judgement to mostly avoid flashing at anything wide, advancing to 26 at lunch, while Ben Stokes had yet to score.
If there was anything West Indies will regret, it was two wasted reviews on hopeful lbw calls that went against them.
After the first two Tests of the series were drawn on placid pitches in Antigua and Barbados, it seems more likely that the Grenada strip will produce a decisive result.   
“There’s some moisture around and the pitch has a decent layer of grass,” Brathwaite said after winning the coin toss for the first time this series.
Both teams made one change from the second Test.
England brought back pace bowler Craig Overton, who missed the second Test due to illness. He replaced Matt Fisher, his late replacement in Barbados, which means England will again play the one specialist spinner, Jack Leach.

5,South Africa face struggle to qualify for World Cup after Bangladesh shocker,A home series defeat to Bangladesh has put the Proteas in a precarious position.,"CENTURION: Cricket World Cups have caused more heartache for South African supporters than any other format of the game.
There have been agonising near-misses and numerous disappointments, but actually qualifying for the tournament has never previously been an issue.
Now, though, South Africa need to find some dramatically improved form or face taking the long road if they want to play in the main event in India in October and November 2023.
A home series defeat to Bangladesh has put the Proteas in a precarious position. They languish ninth on the World Cup Super League log.
Only eight teams, including hosts India, qualify automatically.
The bottom five teams in the Super League will have to endure a qualifying tournament in June 2023, along with five associate nations, with only two places available for India.
“The alarm bells are there and we’re putting ourselves under pressure,” said head coach Mark Boucher after Bangladesh clinched a series victory with a nine-wicket win in Centurion on Wednesday.
South Africa have only won four of their 13 Super League fixtures and they have tough three-match series against England, India and Australia to come. They will, however, expect to win two postponed fixtures against the Netherlands, although the first match of a Covid-shortened series in November was rained off.
Boucher said South Africa “went to sleep” against Bangladesh and needed to improve. But he said automatic qualification was not out of reach. “We’ve beaten the best sides in the world before and we’ll have to beat them again to qualify for the World Cup,” said Boucher.  
“If we arrive with confidence we can beat anyone.” 
Boucher is contracted until the World Cup but is not certain to be in charge by then. He faces a disciplinary hearing on charges of racial discrimination in May which could lead to his dismissal. 
South African captain Temba Bavuma said he was struggling to understand how a team that beat India 3-0 in a series in January could play so poorly against Bangladesh.
Ironically for South Africa, the series against India was not part of the Super League. 
“In the series against India our intensity was at another level but in this series we were not good enough,” said Bavuma. 
He gave credit to Bangladesh. 
“The skill and execution of Bangladesh was at a high level.” 
Eight of the players who appeared against Bangla­desh are contracted to play in the Indian Premier League, which starts on Sunday.
The IPL issue was the source of much speculation leading up to the series, with the IPL players deciding collectively that they would be available for the one-day games but not for two Test matches which start on March 31.
Asked whether the IPL debate was a distraction, Bavuma said: “Individually the guys will have to ask themselves that question but it is not an excuse I will be using.”

“But I feel confident. If I’m serving well and play well from the back, I can beat anyone,” he added.
Earlier, Osaka was cheered on to a 6-3, 6-4 win over Australia’s Sharma.
Osaka was in complete command right from the moment she stepped onto the Hard Rock Stadium court, never allowing Sharma a single break opportunity while keeping her 96th-ranked opponent under constant pressure, converting two of 11 break points.
After the match, Osaka soaked up the applause from the sparse crowd in what was a far different atmosphere from 11 days earlier in Indian Wells when she fought back tears after being heckled during a second-round loss to Veronika Kudermetova.
“This is like my home tournament,” smiled Osaka during her on-court interview, prompting a round of cheers.
“Honestly I just didn’t want to let anything bother me today no matter what happened, like the last match I played was not the greatest memory for me.
“I just wanted to prove I could come back out here and compete and no matter if I won or lost just know I had the best attitude that I could.”
A four-time Grand Slam champion, Japan’s Osaka has seen her ranking fall to 77th coming into the tournament after she took a break from tennis following last year’s US Open to prioritise her mental health.
Osaka’s mental health struggles first manifested themselves at the 2021 French Open when she withdrew from the Grand Slam after deciding to boycott post-match media duties, explaining she had been suffering from depression.
She has taken breaks from the sport on several occasions and said after her match on Wednesday that she was seeing a therapist.
Osaka said the decision to finally seek out professional help came after her sister expressed concern for her.
“I finally started talking to a therapist after Indian Wells,” said Osaka, after setting up a second-round clash with another former world number one Angelique Kerber.  “It only took like a year after the French Open.
“I feel like I’ve been trying a lot of different things because I tend to internalise things, and I also want to do everything by myself.
“The mind is such a big thing. If you can get a professional to help you out .5%, that alone is worth it.”
Also on Wednesday, Sloane Stephens earned a second-round match-up against fellow American Jessica Pegula by topping Hungary’s Panna Udvardy 6-4, 6-3.  Russia’s Anna Kalinskaya defeated Robin Montgomery of the US 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4)and Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania topped Hailey Baptiste of the US 6-7 (6), 6-1, 6-1 to move into a second-round match against women’s No. 1 seed Arnya Sabalenka.

Mitoma replaced Takumi Minamino in the 84th minute and claimed a quick-fire brace that guaranteed Hajime Moriyasu’s side a top-two finish in Group ‘B’ of Asia’s preliminaries and sealed Saudi Arabia’s World Cup spot.
The Australians cannot finish higher than third and will face the third-placed finisher in Group ‘A’ in a playoff, with the winners taking on the fifth-best South American side for a berth at the finals.
Saudi Arabia, who drew 1-1 with China in Sharjah later on Thursday, have 20 points and are certain to finish no lower than second.

Mitoma was the difference between the teams at the Olympic Stadium as the winger, on loan at Belgian side Union SG from Brighton & Hove Albion, struck twice in five minutes.
The 89th-minute opener came after Mitoma linked up with his former Kawasaki Frontale team mates Hidemasa Morita and Miki Yamane before slotting past Mat Ryan.
The second came four minutes into stoppage time as Ryan allowed Mitoma’s low shot to slip through his grasp.
The win moved the Japanese onto 21 points, six more than the Australians with one round of matches remaining.
Meanwhile, Son Heung-min opened the scoring as South Korea moved to the top of Group ‘A’ with a 2-0 win over Iran. Both teams have secured their places Qatar.
The Tottenham Hotspur forward put Paulo Bento’s side in front with a shot from distance in first-half stoppage time at Seoul World Cup Stadium and defender Kim Young-gwon slotted home the second 21 minutes into the second half.
The Koreans lead Iran by a point with the United Arab Emirates in third ahead of their meeting with Iraq in Riyadh.
Lebanon missed the opportunity to move third as they slumped to a 3-0 loss against Syria in Sidon.
First-half goals from Alaa Al Dali, Mardik Mardikian and Mohammad Al Marmour earned Syria their first win of the this round of qualifiers and dealt Lebanon’s World Cup chances a potentially fatal blow.
Victory for the UAE against Iraq would seal third place for the Gulf nation and set up a playoff against the Australians in Qatar on June 7.

10,World Cup playoffs provide Salah-Mane sequel,JOHANNESBURG: Africa’s World Cup playoffs will serve up a Mohamed Salah -Sadio Mane sequel as the Liverpool...,"JOHANNESBURG: Africa’s World Cup playoffs will serve up a Mohamed Salah -Sadio Mane sequel as the Liverpool team-mates face off on opposite sides again with their countries, this time for a place at football’s biggest show. 
Salah’s Egypt will face Mane’s Senegal in one of the continent’s five decisive World Cup playoffs, with the first leg in Cairo on Friday. The draw for the playoffs was made before the two Liverpool stars met in last month’s African Cup of Nations final, which was won by Senegal in a shootout thanks to Mane’s winning penalty. 
The second leg is at Senegal’s new 50,000-seat Abdoulaye Wade Stadium on Tuesday. 
Egypt-Senegal headlines the playoffs, but there’s also a big West African derby pitting Ghana against Nigeria. 
Cameroon are seeking a record-extending eighth appearance by an African nation at the World Cup with Mali hoping to reach the finals for the first time. 
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp recognised the significance of the Egypt-Senegal game when he rested Mane for Sunday’s FA Cup quarter-final against Nottingham Forest because Salah was already out with a minor injury. Klopp didn’t want one to have more rest than the other ahead of the crucial meeting. 
“Because the game is too big in Africa,” Klopp said. 
Senegal coach Aliou Cisse said the Cup of Nations triumph is history and all that matters is securing a second straight World Cup appearance. 
“Winning the Cup of Nations is not an end in itself because we share a common goal of playing at the World Cup again,” he told reporters. 
With a ‘spine’ comprising Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly, PSG midfielder Idrissa Gueye and Mane, Senegal are well equipped to succeed. 
Egypt welcome back star goalkeeper Mohamed el Shenawy, who missed the Cup of Nations final through injury, but they were the second best side in the African title decider and start as underdogs. 
Nigeria start as favourites against Ghana, but tradition suggests a close affair with each nation winning twice in previous World Cup qualifiers and four other meetings drawn. 
Both fared poorly at the Cup of Nations with Ghana shock first-round casualties after losing to minnows Comoros and Nigeria making a timid last-16 departure against Tunisia. 
Nigeria boast a stronger squad than they had in Cameroon with forwards Emmanuel Dennis, Odion Ighalo and Victor Osimhen now available, but injured midfielder Wilfred Ndidi misses out. 
Ghana fired Serb coach Milovan Rajevac after the Cup of Nations debacle and brought in Otto Addo. They are without captain Andre Ayew because of his red card in that loss to Comoros. 
Like Ghana, Algeria have to restore their reputation after a dire defence of their African title in Cameroon, when they exited bottom of their group and without winning a game. There have been repercussions. Veteran striker Baghdad Bounedjah and midfielder Yassine Brahimi have been dropped from the squad by coach Djamel Belmadi for their clash with Cameroon. 
Cameroon fired Portuguese Toni Conceicao after finishing third at the Cup of Nations and hired legend Rigobert Song on the orders of President Paul Biya. The Indomitable Lions’ buildup has been complicated by goalkeeper Andre Onana’s involvement in a serious car crash this week he escaped unhurt and the unavailability of key midfielder Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa because of injury. 
Mali are the only one of the 10 playoff contenders to have never played at a World Cup before. To get to it, they will have to deny Tunisia a sixth World Cup appearance. 
A boost for Mali is the belated decision of France-born Everton midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure to represent the country of his parents. 
Tunisia, who fell to Burkina Faso in the Cup of Nations quarter-finals, have recalled forward Taha Yassine Khenissi after he completed a six-month doping ban. 
The Democratic Republic of Congo, though, could be the story of the playoffs if they surprise Morocco to reach the World Cup for the first time since their only previous appearance at the 1974 tournament in West Germany as Zaire. 
Cup of Nations quarter-finalists Morocco boast a star full-back in Ashraf Hakimi and are the clear favourites to advance even without Chelsea’s Hakim Ziyech, who has turned down a recall because of his ongoing feud with coach Vahid Hallihodzic.

11,A festival of kickboxing and MMA shows Pakistan’s growing interest in the sport,"“There are facilities in Pakistan but affording them is very difficult,"" says one participant.","KARACHI: The atmosphere was buzzing with intensity; the octagon bursting with energy. Fighters from Afghanistan were there. There were women fighters as well, proving that interest in kickboxing and mixed martial arts is peaking in Pakistan. 
Organised by K7 Fitness and Kickboxing Academy and the Sindh Sports Department, the KO1 Revolution event here on Wednesday evening featured 13 high-voltage bouts not only showed the talent but also shone light on the struggle the athletes have to face in taking up the sport. 
“Like any other sport, this isn’t easy to pursue,” Pakistan’s Haziq Chandio, the winner of the main event over Waheed Ahmedi of Afghanistan, told Dawn. “But we have to keep doing this … it’s something that runs in my family. I grew up watching my father and uncle.” 
In the MMA fight against the undefeated Ahmedi, Haziq won on a unanimous decision. With his height advantage, he outpointed Ahmedi easily, throwing punches from a safe distance with his opponent only swinging in the air to connect a knockout blow. 
It was the opening bout between Sadiya and Nataliya that had more action. Bloodied from the nose in the kickboxing flyweight fight before the last round, Sadiya won on a unanimous decision. 
But her joy after winning didn’t last long as her sister Surraya lost her unbeaten record against Eman Khokar in a bout that was so close that it required an additional round for the judges to decide the winner. 
“Just happy to win, don’t want to get too happy though, need to continue training and keeping this up,” Eman, who counts Kyrgyz fighter Valentina Shevchenko as her inspiration, told Dawn before adding that the two women bouts showed that “it isn’t a men-centric sport and girls can compete at a very high level”. 
In another kickboxing bout that went to an additional round saw three-time national champion Naqeebullah kept his unbeaten record while ending Mohammad Rasool’s run. Rasool remarkably was floored four times in the third round but rose to his feet each time, only to lose on a split decision. 
Afghan MMA fighter Jalal Hajizada won his first kickboxing bout when his opponent Zahoor Khan forfeited in the third round, having no response to a flurry of punches from his opponent. 
“Very happy to win here,” Hajizada told Dawn, “but next time I come to Pakistan, I’d like to compete in a MMA bout.” 
Another Afghan victory came in the first round when Samiullah had Sameer Jutt tap out with a guillotine choke in the first round before his compatriot Nastratullah Langari recorded a unanimous decision victory against Haider Farman in the co-main event. 
Haziq ended Afghanistan’s winning run in the day’s final bout while his brother Abdullah had earlier accounted for Afghanistan’s Sultan Najib Amanzai in their kick-boxing bout. 
The night’s only knockout was delivered by Daud Atif to Jamal Abbas; “the destroyer” landing a vicious kick right on the face to live up to his nickname. 
But for all the action and adrenaline, there remained a question of ‘what next’ for these fighters. 
“There are facilities in Pakistan but affording them is very difficult,” another winner on the night Anil Khokar told Dawn. “For just one fight, you have to spend a lot of money on diet and other stuff. There is then a lack of sponsorship so it’s really hard for us to advance and compete on a higher level.”
