In his first day in office, CDA Chairman retired Capt Mohammad Usman Younis on Wednesday morning inaugurated the trail, which starts from sector C-12 and culminates at Kanthla village.
However, it seems, he was not briefed about the status of Margalla Hills by CDA officials. As per the board installed at the trail, it was established by CDA’s environment wing. 
However, sources said that IWMB Chairperson Rina Saeed Khan, wrote a letter to the chairman, saying: “It seems that your good self was not briefed about legal status of Margalla Hills National Park and trail no 7. Unfortunately, the legal consequences of the inauguration are likely to follow and all those present at the inauguration can be held liable for contempt of court.”

IWMB questions inauguration of the site by CDA chairman

The letter further states that trail is inside the boundary of Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP) and as per Islamabad Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Ordinance 1979, and Islamabad High Court (IHC) judgments, IWMB is custodian of MHNP.
It further said that judgment passed by the IHC in a case titled ‘Prof Zahid Baig Mirga Vs CDA’ states inter alia the area of Margalla Hills was notified as an integral part of the national park by the federal government in exercise of powers conferred under section 21 of the Wildlife Ordinance of 1979 vide notification, dated 28-04-1980.
The letter said that the sole authority under the Wildlife Ordinance 1979 to allow such activities (hiking trails) was and continues to be the board.
Ms Saeed told Dawn that the board’s spokesperson will provide further details about this.
Later on, the spokesperson, Umar Bilal approached Dawn and confirmed that the said letter had been written by IWMB chairperson, adding that both IWMB and CDA’s officials established the said trail, but later on without intimating and taking the board into loop, the CDA got it inaugurated early in the morning of Wednesday. 
He said that as per law, IWMB is the custodian of Margalla Hills National Park. “Therefore, just to share our concern [with CDA] we wrote a letter,” he said. 
When contacted, a CDA officer said that the civic agency had not violated any rule while constructing Trail 7, adding that the CDA’s law wing was preparing a proper reply to the IWMB letter. 
When contacted for official comments, CDA’s spokesperson Syed Asif Raza said the Environment Wing of the CDA had developed this facility in lines with Section 21 of the Wildlife Act 1979. 
“The facility is being used by the large segment of the society especially families and is being praised by the public as well. These trails actually serve the core objectives of education and recreation for which the Act of 1979 was promulgated,” he said.

1,Shahbaz Gill’s brother lodges complaint against Judge Zeba Chaudhry,"Complaint says judge's order to remand Gill in police custody amounts to ""gross misconduct, illegality and mala fide intention"".","ISLAMABAD: A brother of Shahbaz Gill on Thursday filed a complaint against Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Zeba Chaudhry for remanding him in police custody.
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan had earlier warned the ADSJ of consequences.
Yaseen Gill filed the complaint with the chief justice of Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the member of the court’s inspection team (MIT).
Kohsar police arrested Mr Gill on August 9 and the judicial magistrate remanded his custody to police till August 12. The police requested the magistrate to extend the remand order, however, he was sent to judicial lockup.
Advocate General Islamabad Barrister Jahangir Khan Jadoon filed a revision petition before Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Adnan which was dismissed.
When the matter was taken to the IHC, acting Chief Justice Justice Aamer Farooq remanded the matter back to the sessions court with the direction to decide the revision petition in accordance with the law.
ADSJ Chaudhry in a subsequent hearing granted two days’ remand of Mr Gill to the police.
However, after she passed the remand order, her order was criticised in social media and ultimately the PTI chairman at two public speeches censured the judge as well as the police authorities.
Interestingly, the IHC acting chief justice disposing of the petition related to Mr Gill’s remand had also upheld the order of ADSJ Chaudhry.
Owing to ‘threatening’ speeches, Mr Khan was booked under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) while IHC’s larger bench issued a show-cause notice over alleged contempt of the judge.
On Thursday, Mr Gill’s brother in the complaint leveled serious allegations against the lady judge.
It stated that she passed the order “on August 17, 2022 in grave violation and derogation of judicial norms, express provisions of law.”
It added: “the said act of conducting the proceedings by the learned ASJ Zeba Chaudhry is amounting to gross misconduct, illegality and mala fide intention committed by her since based on her grave incompetence, glaring negligence and noticeable partiality, violating the code of conduct of a judge, therefore, not covered under the umbrella of good faith or indemnity provided for the protection of a judicial officer.”
According to the complaint, ADSJ Chaudhry assumed jurisdiction of a judicial magistrate by grating Mr Gill’s remand since she could only refer the matter back to the judicial magistrate.
The complainant said the judge could have refused to hear the case in accordance with judicial norms and procedure, adding she was “acting with the investigation agency to destroy the evidence of their crime of inflicting third degree physical torture upon the accused [Gill] for the purpose of screening out the offenders from the charge of cognizable offences of hurt.”
It requested for taking “disciplinary action/proceedings against ADSJ Chaudhry for commission of misconduct.”
Gill files post-arrest bail
Shahbaz Gill filed a post-arrest bail in the case registered against him for allegedly inciting mutiny among armed forces.
Judicial magistrate Malik Aman on August 24 rejected the application of Islamabad police seeking further custody of Mr Gill on physical remand and sent him to Adiala Jail on judicial remand.
The court also issued notice to the police and sought the record.

This observation was made at a conference on the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Bill, 2022, where speakers expressed concern that a country like Pakistan had the sixth highest number of child brides in the world which is close to 1.9 million.
This meeting was arranged by the National Commission on the Status of Women with the help of United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). 
Different stakeholders and speakers were invited for their input on the subject including from the Ministry of Human Rights, Ministry of Law and Justice, Women Parliamentary Caucus, Legal Aid and Justice Authority, National Commission for the Rights of the Child as well as representatives from the local government.
The proposed bill would introduce some necessary amendments in the prevailing Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929, as child marriage was one of the pressing human rights and women’s rights issues in Pakistan.
Deliberating over the issue, speakers expressed that the bill was the need of the hour as it aims to enforce the constitutional rights of children. Article 25(2) of the Constitution ensures that the state may make special provision for the protection of children. 
Furthermore, Pakistan had ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Children (UNCRC) and is under an obligation to enforce the provision of UNCRC. This bill would also strengthen efforts to implement the UNCRC.
Parliamentary Secretary for Human Rights Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar also recommended inserting some provisions to this bill regarding pre-marriage thalassemia test of intending spouses for the prevention of thalassemia in the country. 
She said that the test reports must be annexed with the nikkah nama (marriage documents), given there was a rise of 6,000-8, 000 thalassemia patients annually in Pakistan, where the number of blood donors was quite less compared to the need of present patients.
In his remarks, the Minister for Human Rights Riaz Hussain Pirzada said that child marriage in Pakistan was deeply rooted in poverty with devastating effects on girls.
“Child brides in Pakistan are at an elevated risk of sexual and physical abuse, reproductive health complications, and other adverse physiological and social outcomes,” he said, adding that it was imperative to have awareness in masses on the issue particularly in areas where the ratio of child marriage was high.
“People should be told that attaining marriageable age is the basic right for both contracting partners for their better physical and mental health and most importantly for bearing a healthy next generation,” he said. He committed support in the parliament for this bill.
The minister congratulated chairperson of National Commission on the Status of Women Nilofar Bakhtiar for taking all important stakeholders on board. He observed that this was a challenging issue and the bill needed fresh energy, support and debate for its passage and enactment in the country.

The charged protesters led by PTI local leader Changaiz Khan from Hazro town and adjoining areas reached Islamabad-Peshawar motorway (M-1) near Chach interchange and put traffic out of gear for hours. 
They were holding placards and banners inscribed with slogans against the power utility company and the government. 
The protesters also burnt their electricity bills and demanded of the government to direct the power utility company to immediately waive fuel price adjustment. 
They also shouted slogans against the Iesco, Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) and the government for multiplying electricity tariffs and imposing taxes on consumers.
The protesters pledged not to deposit payments until immediate withdrawal of the FPA and other taxes and issuance of new bills to them by the power distribution companies. Mr Khan, while addressing protesters, said imposing taxes during this time was cruel and the government must withdraw them.
He said that all Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) parties were claiming that they not only had a strategy to control inflation but also had a capable team to pull out the country from economic turmoil. “Almost four months have passed but they only increased tariffs and caused inflation,” he added.
Meanwhile, a motorcycle-rickshaw driver set his three-wheeler on fire after receiving the electricity bill of his house in Pindigheb town of Attock.

9,$10bn jump in export needed: Ahsan Iqbal,Links increase in exports to sustainable economic growth.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan needed an annual jump of $5 billion to $10 billion in exports to ensure a sustainable growth.
These remarks were made byMinister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal at a report launch event, where he committed the incumbent government’s support to the China Pakistan Economic Corridor as well as to expediting work on its related projects.
Federal Minister Board of Investment Salik Hussain and Chairman All Pakistan Chinese Enterprise Association (APCEA) Yang Jianduo, were among guest speakers at the report launch titled ‘Catalyzing Private Investment in Pakistan’
He said when the PML-N government signed $46 billion projects under CPEC back in 2013, no one in the world was willing to bring investment in Pakistan due to the poor law and order situation.Pakistan, he said desperately needed investment in energy and infrastructure sectors. The minister said China invested $29 billion in these sectors during the five years.
He said China also helped Pakistan utilizing its strategic reserves such as Thar Coal which were now producing thousands of megawatt (MW) energy and contributing to the national grid.
Ahsan Iqbal pointed out that $900 billion worth of investment from the developed world was seeking enabling business-friendly environment in the developing countries. “However, the investment can never come to a country where there is political chaos, polarization, and policy reversal,” he added.
He said the annual foreign direct investment (FDI) in Vietnam was about $28-30 billion while in Pakistan in 2020 it was only $1.2 billion.
