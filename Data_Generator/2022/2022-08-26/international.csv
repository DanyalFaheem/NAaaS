0,"Mirwaiz sees long, patient struggle ahead; hopes to address Friday prayers","“Since Aug 4, 2019, I have been forcibly confined to my house,""Hurriyat leader says.","NEW DELHI: Kashmir’s chief cleric and Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq wants to deliver a Friday sermon this week, according to The Hindu. If allowed, it would be his first since the Centre removed special provisions of Article 370 from the Indian constitution in August 2019, 
In a telephonic conversation with the paper, Mirwaiz slammed claims by the Indian government that he had never been detained since the military crackdown began on Aug 5, 2019.
The government says he was free to move around, he was reminded. If that is true he would like to be at the sermon on Friday.
“I have greatly missed delivering Friday sermons at the Jamia Masjid (in Srinagar) and (especially) during Ramazan. I greatly look forward to doing so,”  Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said.
“Once I am released, I want to meet people and listen to them. I want to meet my colleagues and party men and listen and talk to them. My political stand has and will be the same. 
“Resolve the conflict peacefully among the stakeholders, stop suppression of people of J&K and give real peace a chance in the Sub-continent.”
The interviewer reminded him that Jammu and Kashmir’s Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha says Mirwaiz Umar Farooq is a ‘free man’ and was never detained since August 2019. Was he a ‘free man’? The Hindu asked him. 
”Yes, I am free enough to move inside my house, thankfully. If I was a ‘free man’ why wasn’t I allowed to offer Friday prayers and deliver sermons at Jamia Masjid for the last three years? 
“Since Aug 4, 2019, I have been forcibly confined to my house. Police vehicles and force personnel are stationed on both sides of my house near the gates. I am not allowed to move out and only close relatives and a few office staff are allowed to come in, after verification by the police at the gate. 
“It is for all to see, not something hidden. Three years of continuous house incarceration so far.” 
Mirwaiz said he was surprised that a person occupying the highest office in the disputed state would misrepresent facts so publicly. 
“Not only were the facts distorted, they were twisted to create a false impression. If the idea was to defame me, I do not think it has worked. Truth always prevails.”
His grandmother, who lived with him, passed away last year. He led her funeral prayers in the lawns of his house but was not allowed by the authorities to go to the graveyard with other family members. 
“It broke my heart when her body was leaving the house and I stood there alone in tears.
“The last three years of incarceration have been an experience...I was restless and greatly anxious for people and what they must feel and what they may do, also what would happen to them. 
“But gradually with time as the authorities’ plan started unfolding more and more, it became clear what they were aiming at. I understood it is going to be a long battle, and so a time to safeguard and be patient. I also realised that people of Kashmir have over centuries of subjugation and decades of conflict inculcated resilience and instinct that will pull them through and not let machinations against them succeed. 
“This is time for patience, grit and building and strengthening of our character.”

1,Uproar in US town as Indians bring bulldozers to parade,Bulldozer is seen as a symbol of hate against Muslims and other minorities in India.,"WASHINGTON: Edison is a town of about 110,000 people in New Jersey. In the 2000 census, 17.75 percent of Edison residents identified themselves as Indian- Americans.
This is the highest percentage of Indian-American people of any municipality in the United States. So, it’s no surprise that the city’s mile-long commercial belt is called Little India.   
Like every year, Edison residents also celebrated India’s Independence Day with day-long rallies, fares, and other cultural events. But this year, Edison’s Indian Americans did something that had not been done before.  
Some of them came to the parade with a bulldozer with pictures of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. A banner next to Adityanath’s photo on the controversial float described it as “Baba ka Bulldozer.
The rest of the population — 44.10 percent Whites, 43.17 percent other Asians, such as Chinese, Koreans, 7.05 percent African Americans and others — did not understand the significance of this symbol. Not until, the city’s Muslim population – Indians, Pakistanis, and Arabs – explained it to them.
Azra Baig, chair of the South Brunswick’s Human Relations Commission, said at this week’s Township Council meeting that “as someone who is Muslim, I find this terrorizing and harassing, and so does the Muslim community across New Jersey and across the country.” Her remarks were published in the local media.
In India, homes, businesses, and places of worship “are bulldozed because of people’s faith and when they stand up for their rights.” Baig said.
She and other Muslims explained that the bulldozer was a symbol of the ruling BJP’s muscle-power, and “something this hateful should never be included in a parade in Edison.”
The message – that the bulldozer was a symbol of hate against Muslims and other minorities – annoyed Edison residents who demanded an explanation from the parade organisers — Indian Business Association. The organizers, however, did not respond to calls seeking an explanation.
. “That bulldozer was an evil display of bigotry, racism, injustice and prejudice. That was wrong,” an Edison resident told a local news outlet, My Central Jersey.
Dylan Terpstra, operations coordinator of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) New Jersey, told the Township Council meeting that the symbolism could have more far-reaching effects.
“Most people in America don’t understand this is a form of hate. This needs to be condemned, and the organizers need to be told it’s unacceptable; and there should be more of a vetting process,” he said.
Baig said she was concerned that such displays could spread to local schools as well, where Muslims “are often blamed even when fire alarms go off.”
Councilwoman Margot Harris told another local media outlet that even though they participated in the parade, they did not know that the bulldozer was a symbol of hate against Muslims. “But I do find what took place a week ago Sunday to be absolutely hideous, unacceptable,” she said, “Those responsible for putting this on display have to be held accountable and we need some answers about what they plan to do about this going forward,” she said
The councilwoman also called for more education on cultural sensitivity and what kind of symbols were toxic to different cultures.
The Town Council Vice President Joyce Ship-Freeman said she was disturbed by the event. She said if there were a noose in the parade, the council members would not have been walking behind it.
The reaction persuaded Edison’s Indian American Mayor Sam Joshi to declare that symbols of hate and discrimination were not welcome in the township.

2,Three ‘militants’ shot dead in India-occupied Kashmir,"‘Militants’ were killed near an Indian army post after they allegedly crossed the Line of Control in Uri sector, say police.","SRINAGAR: Three suspected militants were killed in India-held Kashmir on Thursday, in the fourth such incident along the Line of Control in five days. 
The ‘militants’ were killed near an Indian army post after they allegedly crossed the Line of Control in Uri sector, police said on Twitter. 
The latest incident came four days after Indian soldiers fired on and captured a suspected militant in Rajouri sector. 
A spokesman said the injured `militant’ was being treated at an Indian army facility after “soldiers donated blood to help save his life”. 
On Monday, two suspected militants were killed in a minefield in Akhnoor, while a third person managed to flee. 
Another group of “three to four” men fled the same day in the same area when “soldiers confronted them”, the spokesman added. 
Two suspected militants stormed an army camp in Rajouri earlier this month and killed five Indian soldiers before being shot dead.

3,US hits ‘Iran-backed group’ for third straight day in Syria,"3 members of Iran-aligned militia killed in attack, say military sources.","AMMAN/WASHINGTON: The US military on Thursday hit several targets in the Syrian city of Mayadin in parts of Deir al Zor province under government control, in the third day of skirmishes with Iran-backed groups, local military sources said.
They said at least three members of an Iran-aligned militia were killed when they were targeted by a US helicopter as they were about to prepare a rocket launcher in the town which lies along the western bank of the Euphrates.
Iranian militias have a strong presence in the town and have long targeted the nearby Al Omar oil field on the eastern bank of the Euphrates where the US coalition have their biggest base in Syria.
The base also known as Green Village was last night targeted in a second consecutive day of violence between the US military and Iran-backed militants that injured at least one US service member and killed up to four militants, according to the US military.The latest exchange of fire underscored soaring military  tensions even amid diplomatic efforts between Tehran and the West to  try to save Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with major powers.
It came a  day after President Joe Biden authorised US air strikes in Syria on an  ammunition depot and other facilities used by groups affiliated with  Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).
The US military  said the suspected Iran-backed militants launched two separate attacks  starting at approximately 7:20pm local time in Syria.
Several  rockets landed inside the perimeter of Mission Support Site Conoco in  northeast Syria and were quickly followed by rocket fire near Mission  Support Site Green Village, it said in a statement.Central Command said the wounded US service  member had been at Mission Support Site Conoco and returned to duty  after treatment. Two other servicemembers were under evaluation for  minor injuries, it said. Some injuries, including brain trauma, can manifest after an incident.
“We are closely monitoring the situation,” General Michael  “Erik” Kurilla, who leads Central Command, said in a statement. The latest attacks by the suspected Iran-backed groups could be retaliation for Biden’s air strikes on Tuesday.Meanwhile, Syrian  air defences intercepted  “hostile targets” over Hama’s countryside,  state media reported on Thursday.

4,US says it backs ‘democratic’ order in Pakistan,State Department spokesperson declines to weigh in more specifically on charges against Imran.,"WASHINGTON: The United States said on Thursday that it backed democratic principles in Pakistan after former prime minister Imran Khan, an outspoken critic of Washington, was slapped with charges.
“We support the peaceful upholding of democratic, constitutional and legal principles,” State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters.
“The United States values our longstanding cooperation with Pakistan and has always viewed a prosperous and democratic Pakistan as critical to US interests,” he said.
He declined to weigh in more specifically on charges against Mr Khan, who was ousted in a parliamentary vote in April but hopes to stage a comeback in elections.
Mr Khan was granted interim bail after being slapped with charges by an anti-terrorism court over comments against a judge over the detention of an official in the former prime minister’s party.

5,Rohingya in BD remember ‘genocide day’,KUTUPALONG: Thous­ands of Rohingya refugees held  “Genocide Remembrance Day” rallies on Thursday across a huge...,"KUTUPALONG: Thous­ands of Rohingya refugees held  “Genocide Remembrance Day” rallies on Thursday across a huge network of camps in Bangladesh, marking five years since fleeing a military offensive in Myanmar.
In August 2017 around 750,000 of the mostly Muslim minority streamed over the border with mainly Buddhist Myanmar to escape the onslaught, which is now the subject of a landmark genocide case at the UN’s top court.
Today there are nearly a million Rohingya — half of them under 18 — in rickety huts in camps where the mud lanes regularly become rivers of sewage during monsoon rains.
Thousands staged rallies in many of the camps on Thursday, holding banners, shouting slogans and demanding a safe return to their home state of Rakhine in western Myanmar.
“Today is the day thousands of Rohingya were killed,” young leader Maung Sawyedollah said with tears in his eyes as he led a rally in Kutupalong — the world’s largest refugee settlement. “Five years ago this day nearly one million Rohingya were displaced. On this day in 2017 more than 300 of our villages were burnt down to ashes,” he said. “All we want is a safe and dignified return to our homeland,” said Sayed Ullah, another community leader.
“Unfortunately, our cries have fallen on deaf ears. The international community is not doing anything,” he added. Other protesters recalled the horror of the Myanmar offensive, which the government says was a legitimate response to militant attacks.
“First they burnt our house. My mother was hiding in the house and they dragged her from there. First they cut her hands and then cut her throat,” said Sufia Khatun, 42.
Several attempts at repatriation have failed, with Rohingya refusing to return without guarantees for their security and rights in Myanmar, where many see the minority as foreigners.

6,"Drought spreads across half of China, Tibet included",Temperatures as high as 45 degrees Celsius have led multiple Chinese provinces to impose industrial power cuts.,"CHONGQING: A crippling drought exacerbated by a record heatwave has spread across half of China and reached the normally frigid Tibetan Plateau, according to official data released ahead of more searing temperatures on Thursday.
The world’s second-largest economy has experienced over 70 days of heatwaves, flash floods and droughts — phenomena that scientists say are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.
Southern China has recorded its longest continuous period of high temperatures since records began more than 60 years ago, the agriculture ministry said this week.
Experts have said the intensity, scope and duration of the heatwave could make it one of the worst recorded in global history.
A chart from the National Climate Centre showed that swathes of southern China — including the Tibetan Plateau — were experiencing  “severe” to  “extraordinary” drought conditions.
The worst-affected area — the Yangtze river basin, stretching from coastal Shanghai to Sichuan province in China’s southwest — is home to over 370 million people and contains several manufacturing hubs including the megacity of Chongqing.
The China Meteorological Administration predicted continued high temperatures of up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in Chongqing and the provinces of Sichuan and Zhejiang on Thursday.
But some regions gained relief from the heatwave. Parts of southwestern Sichuan were battered by heavy rains overnight, causing the evacuation of almost 30,000 people, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
And in the southeast, Typhoon Ma-on made landfall in coastal Guangdong province and Hong Kong Thursday morning. “High temperatures have basically been alleviated in the regions of south China, Jiangxi and Anhui,” the meteorological administration said.
“But high temperatures will continue for the next three days in regions including the Sichuan basin and provinces surrounding Shanghai.”
China’s State Council on Wednesday announced a 10 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) subsidy to support rice farmers experiencing drought conditions, which authorities have warned pose a  “severe threat” to this year’s autumn harvest.
China produces more than 95 percent of the rice, wheat and maize it consumes, but a reduced harvest could mean increased demand for imports in the world’s most populous country -- putting further pressure on global supplies already strained by the conflict in Ukraine.
Wednesday’s CCTV evening news broadcast showed trucks supplying villagers who lacked drinking and agricultural water in rural Sichuan and Chongqing. These regions have also been battling wildfires since last week, exacerbated by high temperatures and water scarcity.
Livestock owners have fared badly, with Chongqing authorities pledging emergency measures to protect pig farms and a Sichuan farmer’s tearful plea going viral after she said all her chickens had died due to the heatwave and power cuts. Some Chongqing residents complained on social media about queueing for hours in sweltering heat for compulsory mass testing required in the wake of a Covid outbreak.
In parts of Sichuan and Chongqing, locals seeking cooler temperatures have taken to sleeping in car parks and subway stations due to daily power cuts.
Temperatures as high as 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) have led multiple Chinese provinces to impose industrial power cuts, as cities struggle to cope with a surge in demand for electricity.

7,Japan’s police chief resigns over Abe assassination,TOKYO: The head of Japan’s National Police Agency announced his resignation on Thursday after an investigation...,"TOKYO: The head of Japan’s National Police Agency announced his resignation on Thursday after an investigation confirmed  “shortcomings” in the security plans for assassinated former prime minister Shinzo Abe.
Abe, the country’s best-known politician and longest-serving premier, was shot and killed while delivering a stump speech on July 8 in the city of Nara in western Japan.
“There were shortcomings in the security plans and the risk assessments on which they were based, and direction from the field commander was insufficient,” Itaru Nakamura told reporters.
“The root of this problem lies in the limitations of the current system, which has been in place for years, in which local police bear sole responsibility for providing security.” Nakamura said he would take responsibility for the failings and step down from his post as police chief.
“We have decided to shake up our personnel and start afresh with our security duties, and that’s why I tendered my resignation to the National Public Safety Commission today,” he said.
Abe’s suspected killer was detained at the scene and is believed to have targeted the politician because he thought he was linked to the Unification Church. Local police in the area Abe was killed had already acknowledged  “undeniable” flaws in security for the former leader, which was comparatively light on the day he was shot.
The Nara police chief also made a tearful resignation on Thursday.
The National Police Agency’s report said areas south of the podium from which Abe spoke were not properly guarded, leaving a route open for the shooter to approach.
If adequate security personnel had been in place there,  “it is deemed highly probable that this incident could have been prevented”, the report concluded.
The man suspected of killing Abe, Tetsuya Yamagami, is believed to have fired two shots from a handmade weapon. But the police report found officials at the scene did not immediately realise the sound made by the first shot was caused by a gun,  “leading to delays in their coming to his (Abe’s) defence”.
“There is a possibility that what happened could have been prevented had they understood the situation immediately and evacuated (Abe) for protection when the first gunshot was heard,” Nakamura said.
He added it was  “essential” to improve capacity among security officials and that the police agency would  “implement high-level education and drills aimed at contingency responses, including helping officials better discern gunshots and take immediate evacuation measures”.
The report also said the National Police Agency will now become more involved in organising security for individuals, and will collect and share intelligence with local police.
Suspected shooter Yamagami is reportedly undergoing a psychiatric evaluation to determine his state of mind at the time of the assassination.
Prosecutors are expected to determine whether he can bear criminal liability based on the examination, before making a decision on whether to indict him.
Yamagami’s mother is reported to have made large donations to the Unification Church, which her son blamed for the family’s financial difficulties.
Abe’s family held a private funeral for him shortly after his death, but a state funeral is also being organised, with leaders from around the world expected to attend the September 27 event.

Vicky Bowman, who served as envoy from 2002 to 2006, was detained for failing to declare she was living at an address different from the one listed on her foreigner’s registration certificate, a junta statement said.
Her husband Htein Lin was arrested for helping his wife reside at an address different to their registered home in commercial hub Yangon, it added. 
A spokesperson for the British embassy in Yangon said they were  “concerned by the arrest of a British woman in Myanmar”, without mentioning Bowman by name.
“We are in contact with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance,” they said.
A source with knowledge of the matter said Bowman and Htein Lin had been taken to Yangon’s Insein prison. A hearing had been set for September 6, although it was not known what would take place then, the source added. Breaching immigration law carries a maximum of five years in prison. A junta spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.

9,"‘Highly likely’ jailed Najib Razak will get royal pardon, says Mahathir Mohamad","Delays in trials related to multi-billion-dollar corruption scandal at state fund will result in justice being denied, he says.","KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia’s veteran two-time leader Mahathir Mohamad said on Thursday that disgraced former premier Najib Razak, who he helped bring down, was likely to win a royal pardon and be freed from a 12-year jail sentence for graft that he began this week.
Mahathir, whose historic election victory in 2018 triggered Najib’s downfall, said delays in various trials related to the multi-billion-dollar corruption scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) would result in justice being denied.
The palace of King Al-Sultan Abdullah, which received a petition for a pardon from Najib loyalists a day earlier, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Mahathir’s remark.
On Tuesday, the country’s top court rejected Najib’s final appeal against a 2020 conviction by a lower court, and upheld the 12-year jail sentence and a 210 million ringgit ($46.88 million) fine for illegally receiving $10 million from a unit of 1MDB.
“For Najib, it is highly likely that he will be pardoned after being imprisoned,” the 97-year-old Mahathir said in a statement. He did not elaborate.
Najib is believed to be close to some of Malaysia’s royals, and in May, Najib’s social media posts showed him attending Eid celebrations with the king.
But, there has been no indication so far on how the palace would respond to any pardon application by Najib, who held power for nine years until 2018.
Nor has there been any sign yet of how Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob would regard a pardon for his old party leader, as he seeks to rehabilitate the image of the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).
Having been sent to jail on Tuesday after losing the appeal in one of the smaller cases related to the siphoning off of money from the state fund he co-founded in 2009, Najib was back in court on Thursday for a hearing in the largest case.
He was brought from the Kajang prison complex southeast of the capital to the Kuala Lumpur high court in a black police car under heavy security and was taken to the courtroom through a private entrance.
At the end of the day’s hearing, Najib — in a dark suit and tie — waved to reporters from the police car on his way back to Kajang. He did not comment, but an aide to the former premier said he was  “doing OK.” 
In a social media post, Najib’s daughter Nooryana Najwa said he had been provided with basic necessities in prison, and  “was getting used to his new routine.”

10,Latvia removes controversial Soviet-era monument,RIGA: Latvia dismantled on Thursday a Soviet-era monument in its capital city Riga following Russia’s invasion of...,"RIGA: Latvia dismantled on Thursday a Soviet-era monument in its capital city Riga following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite protests from the Baltic state’s ethnic Russian minority to keep it.
Demolition machinery was used to remove the 79-metre World War II memorial, which has become a rallying point for the Kremlin’s supporters in Latvia, according to a journalist at the scene.
Latvia, like fellow Baltic states Estonia and Lithuania, is a Nato and EU member that has shown strong support for Ukraine in the conflict with Russia.
Built in 1985, the Monument to the Liberators of Soviet Latvia and Riga from the German Fascist Invaders had featured statues of soldiers and a woman surrounding a central obelisk.
Local officials were forced to take down the monument after Latvia’s parliament voted to remove all remaining Soviet statues, plaques and bas-reliefs by mid-November.
Latvia’s ethnic Russian community — which makes up 30 percent of the population — had protested the removal of the memorial. Every year, thousands of ethnic Russians rallied at the monument on May 9 to commemorate the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945.
Most Latvians see this date as the beginning of the Soviet occupation, which lasted until 1991.
The monument has been controversial from the beginning, as the original idea — a woman with an infant waiting for men to come back from the war — was censored in favour of a more Soviet theme.
It had also drawn criticism due to the fact that one of its sculptors, Levs Bukovskis, had served in a Waffen SS unit during the war.
