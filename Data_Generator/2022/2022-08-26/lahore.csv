Dera Ghazi Khan’s flooded areas had chaotic scenes as people scampered to lay hands on food items brought by the district administration. There were reports of starvation among people in various parts of the flood-hit areas.  
The rain created panic in Muzaffargarh, especially its Kot Addu and Jatoi tehsils, where river erosion took place. The people of Kot Addu Darri 34 spurs and Lundi Pittafi in Jatoi were in trouble.  
More than 500,000 acres of cotton crops had been damaged by floods and heavy rains, leaving the farmers in distress. The farmers and tenants who have to pay dues to landlords are facing a great deal of difficulty as they had taken seeds and pesticides on credit but their cotton crops have been damaged.  

Shelters, crops have been flattened

The growers say the district administration has yet to start the survey of losses of crops and houses. They demand that the Punjab government declare the district a calamity-hit area.  
Deputy Commissioner Ali Annan Qamar said 300,000-acre land had been inundated with the Indus water and more than 50,000 people had been evacuated. He said a survey would start in September because the administration was busy in evacuation and monitoring the flood situation these days.  
A number of people reached the offices of the assistant commissioners in Muzaffargarh and Kot Addu tehsils to impress upon the officials the need to drain out the water.  
Secretary Housing Javed Akhtar Mahmood said teams distributed food items and lunch boxes in Taunsa Sharif. He said the rehabilitation would take a month.  
River erosion continued at Kot Adu/Head Taunsa barrage due to rain. There was a high-level flood in the river Indus. Spur No 34 is facing severe erosion due to floodwater coming from Kot Addu and the administration has mobilised teams to repair leakage in spur dam.  
DERA GHAZI KHAN: Continuous spells of  heavy downpour at Sulaiman Range as well as on large swathes of land between the Indus river and the foothills of mountains have created obstacles to rescue operation and also enhanced the food crisis.  
The hill  torrents have been proving a bolt from the blue for the people for the last one month.   
A number of flood-affected people of Rojhan invaded two trucks carrying food hampers at ARC (arazi record centre) for distribution. Officials failed to maintain order, allowing people to lay their hands on food packets.  
An officer of Rojhan police told  Dawn that 5,000 or so people gathered to get food  items at the ARC and there was a chaotic situation which the administration could not control.  
Some people said the officials were engaged in chief secretary’s visit to Rojhan.  
Meanwhile, a message by a young man from Hazrat  Sakhi Shiro’s shrine at Rajanpur’s Gorchani tribal area is doing the rounds. It says: “The people of the tribal area which is on the northwest side of hill  torrent Kaha Sultan and those in the settlements around the shrine have been  suffering from starvation for the past 10 days. Owing to strong  winds, the tents have flown away and goods and livestock have been swept away. The same is the case with other areas such as Mari, Khulchas, Loot Lal, Khaliri Thal, Daraz Thal and Chatri. No aid has yet arrived from the government, no food, no medicine for  the children or the sick.  
“Loundi Saidan and Harand roads are  closed. Matches to Panadol tablets are not available in the tribal area.  The people of the tribal area are currently going through a difficult  situation. Our MPAs and MNAs are not taking due interest in rescue and  relief activities. We appeal to the political assistant, deputy commissioner  Rajanpur and commissioner Dera Ghazi Khan to take some steps for  the people of tribal area and provide relief by every possible means.”      
A flood victim said the floodwater  had swept away the entire colonies. “One can’t find the traces of their houses...”.

The minister through his counsel contended that the FIA unlawfully took cognisance of the matter relating to the prohibited funding and fake accounts after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued its decision. He said the inquiry initiated by the FIA was nothing but political victimisation.  
The counsel asked the court to set aside the impugned notice issued by the FIA to the petitioner for being unlawful and based on mala fide intention.  
Dismissing the petition, Justice Tariq Nadeem observed that a notice of an inquiry could not be suspended in a constitutional petition.  
The FIA has initiated the inquiry into the matter pertaining to the ECP order in the PTI ‘prohibited’ funding case. An investigation team was notified just a few days after a three-member ECP bench in a unanimous verdict ruled that the PTI received prohibited funding in the case pending since 2014.  
The FIA says the probe is being conducted under Section 6 of Political Parties Order, 2002. The agency has issued notices to several leaders of the PTI across the country.

7,"Azadi March fallout: Body formed to ‘punish’ SHOs for thrashing PTI leaders, workers","Lahore DIG Security Mehboob Rashid was appointed as head of the committee, which comprised some other officers, including the SSPs discipline and admin.","LAHORE: Lahore police high command has constituted a high-powered inquiry committee to grill nearly two dozen former and serving station house officers (SHOs) for allegedly thrashing the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders and workers in the wake of the party’s May 25 Azadi March.
The committee was formed after the PTI’s top leadership mounted pressure, giving a message to the Punjab government and the police high-ups that they would have to face the wrath of the party (PTI) if the police officials involved in the action were not made ‘examples’ for others.
An official, privy to the information, said Lahore DIG Security Mehboob Rashid was appointed as head of the committee, which comprised some other officers, including the SSPs discipline and admin.
Initially, Lahore Investigations SSP Imran Khishwar was assigned the job of the head of the committee but he refused to take the responsibility due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The official said the committee shall conduct inquiries to define the role of the former SHOs and some DSPs who were identified by an anti-victimisation committee, constituted by the PTI top leadership in Punjab. Headed by PTI senior leader Shafqat Mahmood, the committee comprised of many other political leaders of the party, lawyers and workers.
Earlier, the Punjab government had removed the then Lahore Capital City Police Officer Bilal Siddique Kamyana and the then Lahore DIG operations on the same allegations.
The official said that the formal formation of the high-powered committee of the senior police officers had left a disturbing message for those officials who were to undergo the inquiry in the wake of the Azadi March.
There are reports that the committee may recommend major punishment of dismissal from service, registration of criminal cases or both against the officials found guilty of charges.
The PTI’s committee has provided a complete record of criminal cases lodged against its party leaders, activists and workers before and during Azadi March in Lahore, the official said.
On the recommendations of the anti-victimisation committee, the Lahore police authorities have already closed over a dozen SHOs to the Police Lines.
On the other hand, during a recent meeting with a DIG police in this respect, some former SHOs took up the issue, saying they had followed the orders of the senior command and had done nothing in personal capacity.
He said a former SHO told the DIG and other officers present in the meeting that he was among those SHOs who received an order on an official Whatsapp number that Section 144 had been imposed in the provincial capital Lahore before the Azadi March. They were directed that Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) of 1973 authorises the law enforcers to issue an order to prohibit the assembly of four or more people in an area.
According to the law, the former SHO said, every member of such ‘unlawful assembly’ could be booked for engaging in rioting. The then SHOs and DSPs were strictly directed to ensure implementation, arrest the violators, he said and added that they had given complete compliance to the lawful orders of their bosses.
The other former SHOs present also endorsed the viewpoint of their colleague, saying that the unrest has prevailed in the junior ranks of police for holding only heads of the police stations accountable.
The official source said the senior leadership of the police also expressed serious concerns, saying the IGP and other decision-making leadership should take notice of the matter.

Justice Anwaar Hussain took up a joint petition filed by the officials besides another one by former chairman of the NAB retired justice Javed Iqbal challenging the formation of the inquiry commission.
An assistant attorney general told the court that he filed a reply on behalf of the federal government with the registrar office.
The judge directed the law officer to present the reply on the next date of hearing to be fixed by the court later.
The judge also allowed an application moved by Tayyaba Gul to become a necessary party in the case.
The petition was filed by NAB’s Deputy Director Muhammad Imran, Additional Director Kashif Masroor, Assistant Director Farrukh Hayat and Sub-Inspector (SI) Muhammad Latif.
The petitioners through counsel Safdar Shaheen Pirzada argued that the impugned notices issued to the petitioners were illegal and liable to be set aside. 
He argued that all the acts done in good faith as NAB officials were protected under the law as envisaged by section 36 of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999.
He said the ‘frivolous’ allegations were below human dignity and at the same time the purpose of the “mudslinging” by the complainant woman was only to get fame in media/social media.
The counsel asked the court to set aside the impugned notices issued by the inquiry commission to the petitioners.
On last hearing, the judge had restrained the commission from taking coercive measures against the petitioners.
