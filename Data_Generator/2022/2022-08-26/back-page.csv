1,Russian attack kills 25 civilians on Ukraine’s Independence Day,"EU warns those ""responsible for rocket terror will be held accountable"".","

KYIV: A Russian attack killed 25 civilians when missiles struck a railway station and a residential area in eastern Ukraine, officials in the capital Kyiv said, as the nation marked its Independence Day under heavy shelling.
The European Union condemned Russia’s deadly bombardment and warned those “responsible for Russian rocket terror will be held accountable”. “The EU strongly condemns another heinous attack by Russia on civilians,” EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell tweeted.

 





 
The death toll from the Russian attack rose from an initially reported 22 after three more bodies were retrieved from the rubble in the town of Chaplyne as rescue operations there ended, Ukrainian presidential aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said on Thursday.
The Vyshgorod region, directly north of Kyiv, also came under rocket attack, but there were no casualties reported, regional official Olexiy Kuleba said on the Telegram channel.

EU warns those ‘responsible for rocket terror will be held accountable’; Biden calls Zelensky, asks Russia to agree on demilitarised zone around N-plant

The missile strikes and artillery shelling of frontline towns, such as Kharkiv, Mykolaiv, Nikopol and Dnipro, followed President Volodymyr Zelensky’s warnings of the risk of “repugnant Russian provocations” ahead of Wednesday’s 31st anniversary of independence from Moscow-dominated Soviet rule.
Aug 24 also marked six months since Russian forces invaded Ukr­aine, starting Europe’s most devastating conflict since World War Two.
Commenting on the attack, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Twitter: “Russia’s missile strike on a train station full of civilians in Ukraine fits a pattern of atrocities. We will continue, together with partners from around the world, to stand with Ukraine and seek accountability for Russian officials.”

 





 
As rescue operations wrapped up in Chaplyne, residents of this small town, located some 145km west of Russian-occupied Donetsk, grieved for their loved ones amid the rubble of their wrecked homes.
The Russian defence ministry had no immediate comment on the attack. Speaking in Uzbekistan, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu repeated Moscow’s line it had deliberately slowed what it calls a “special military operation” in Ukraine to avoid civilian casualties.
Demilitarised zone
Russia should agree to a demilitarised zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine and allow international officials to assess its safety, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Thursday.
The plant, Europe’s largest, was seized by Russia in March and remains close to the frontline. It has come under repeated fire in recent weeks, raising fears of a nuclear disaster, with both Russia and Ukraine accusing each other of shelling it.
“Russia should agree to the demilitarised zone around the plant and agree to allow an International Atomic Energy Agency visit as soon as possible to check on the safety and security of the system,” Jean-Pierre said.
She said the plant had come up in a call on Thursday between U.S. President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Both Ukrainian and Russian officials have said the UN nuclear watchdog IAEA could visit the plant soon.
In the call, Biden reinforced US support for Ukraine, which was invaded by Russia six months ago in what Ukraine and the West described as an unprovoked war of aggression.
Moscow says it is carrying out a “special military operation” to “demilitarise” and “denazify” its smaller neighbour.
“I know it is a bittersweet anniversary, but I made it clear that the United States would continue to support Ukraine and its people as they fight to defend their sovereignty,” Biden said on Twitter.

2,Taliban ‘have not found’ Zawahiri’s body yet,"THE Afghan Taliban have not found the body of Ayman al-Zawahiri and are continuing investigations, group ...","THE Afghan Taliban have not found the body of Ayman al-Zawahiri and are continuing investigations, group spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said on Thursday, Reuters reported.
Mr Mujahid’s statement came after the United States said it killed the al Qaeda leader in an airstrike in Kabul last month.
The US killed Zawahiri with a missile fired from a drone while he stood on a balcony at his hideout in July, US officials said, in the biggest blow to al Qaeda since US Navy Seals shot dead Osama bin Laden more than a decade ago.
His death in Kabul raised questions about whether he received sanctuary from the Taliban, who had assured the United States as part of a 2020 agreement on the withdrawal of US-led forces that they would not harbour other militant groups.
Zawahiri, an Egyptian doctor, was closely involved in the Sept 11, 2001 attacks on the US and was one of the world’s most wanted men.
In an interview with Dubai-based Akhbar Al Aan earlier this week, Zabiullah Mujahid said the Taliban were sceptical about the Zawahiri incident, describing it as pure allegations with no evidence so far.
“We do not know whether Ayman al-Zawahiri was killed in Kabul, or are these just rumours or allegations,” he told Al Aan’s Safa Saleh. “But the investigations are still open, and when they are over, we will announce the result with the whole world … we will share it through the media and we will not hide any result.”
To another question, he reiterated that Zawahiri’s presence had not been proven so far “by evidence”.
He admitted that al Qaeda members were present in Kabul “but 20 years ago”.
“Many of them are gone or dead. Now there is no element of al Qaeda inside the territory of Afghanistan, unless he is hidden and we do not know, and we are trying to find out about them,” he said.

3,Israel indicts top Islamic Jihad leader,"Charges against Bassam Al-Saadi include serving in an illegal organisation and incitement, says Israeli military.","OFER PRISON: Israel on Thursday indicted a senior leader of the Iran-backed Islamic Jihad movement whose arrest led to a brief conflict in Gaza earlier this month and whose detention is likely to fuel tensions.
The charges against Bassam Al-Saadi, who was arrested on Aug 1 during a raid in the occupied West Bank city of Jenin, include serving in an illegal organisation and incitement, according to a statement from the Israeli military.
Anticipating retaliation to Al-Saadi’s arrest, Israel launched what it called pre-emptive strikes against his group in the Gaza Strip, where it is based, leading to three days of Israeli air strikes and Palestinian rockets. He has been held in an Israeli military prison.
Al-Saadi, according to the military, is an “influential senior official” in Islamic Jihad who it said worked on “core terrorist activities” that include receiving funds from Gaza.
An Islamic Jihad spokesman, Dawood Shehab, said Israel was fabricating charges based on “misleading and unfounded accusations”. Shehab said the group would ask Egypt and the United Nations to intervene, and issued a veiled threat that it could respond with violence if Al-Saadi was not released.
“Reaching a dead end would give us the full right to use other tracks and other options,” said Shehab.
The Israeli military prosecutor asked to keep Al-Saadi in custody for the remainder of the legal process, the army said.
Gaza is ruled by Hamas, an Islamist group much larger than Islamic Jihad, which stayed out of the cross-border fighting at the start of the month.

4,NA panel concerned over Rs10bn ‘theft’ at Steel Mills,Standing committee chairperson directs authorities to pursue case effectively with FIA and ensure culprits are brought to justice.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Industries and Production on Thursday expressed concern over the reported theft of Rs10 billion material and equipment from Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM).
The chairman of the committee, Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah, said that it was a matter of grave concern that the material and equipment worth billions of rupees had been stolen from PSM.
Mr Shah directed the Ministry of Industries and Production to pursue the case effectively with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and ensure that the inquiry was not left incomplete so that culprits were brought to justice.
The committee decided to discuss the privatisation of PSM with the Privatisation Commission in the next meeting.
The committee also expressed concern over the shortage of urea fertiliser despite the fact that it was not being used in the country nowadays due to heavy rains and floods.
After discussions on the subject, the chairman of the committee directed the ministry of industries and production to ensure the availability of urea at affordable prices and also take concrete measures to stop its smuggling across the border as its price was higher in international markets.
Earlier, the secretary of the ministry of industries apprised the committee of the efforts made by the ministry to provide subsidy to farmers in farm machinery and to bring down the prices of automobiles in the country.
The chairman of the committee informed the members that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would soon announce a special subsidy for farmers to help them increase per acre yield and to boost up the country’s economy.
The committee also expressed concern over the price hike of automobiles in the country. The officials concerned informed the committee that fluctuations in the rate of dollar had been a key factor for increase in the cost of production.
The committee directed the ministry of industries to take stringent measures to stop the monopoly of the car manufacturing sector and devise a strategy to end the role of middlemen to reduce the prices of vehicles in the country.

6,How NDTV was hoisted with its own petard,"NEW DELHI: There are a host of news portals across South Asia, and newspapers too, that crave the reader’s...","NEW DELHI: There are a host of news portals across South Asia, and newspapers too, that crave the reader’s financial support in these dire days as a way to stay clear of corporate or government charity to get by.
NDTV that has come under a corporate predator’s clutches this week was never one of them. Its worldview was assiduously pro-free market from the beginning, more so since the advent of Manmohan Singh’s economic wizardry in 1991.
As corporate interests coalesced with brazenly rightwing politics, NDTV found itself in a bind. The rise of Narendra Modi saw it making room for prime time interventions by rightwing analysts. In the meantime, it ran into financial rough weather, and was bailed out by those that scrupulous journalists seek to avoid being beholden to.
In a shrinking field for free media in India, however, NDTV continued to offer solace to the old school of news consumers, albeit in fits and starts. Its Hindi channel saved the day, with anchors like Ravish Kumar standing their ground and challenging the powers frontally to surrender to probity and demands of democracy.
A potentially debilitating blow was set into motion on Wednesday against NDTV, more so its Hindi channel, as a key business ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly initiated a hostile takeover of the bilingual TV firm. The move took NDTV’s proprietors by surprise, and the channel issued a formal statement to express its shock. The Gautam Adani group first came into prominence when Mr Modi travelled to Delhi from Ahmedabad in the company’s private plane for his swearing in as prime minister in May 2014. Since then the opposition has accused the government of lavishing sweetheart deals on the company. Reports said the group had made an open offer to mop up another lot of NDTV’s shares to give the company controlling rights. NDTV indicated its outrage and vulnerabilities too.
“Without any discussion with New Delhi Television Limited (NDTV) or its founder-promoters, Radhika and Prannoy Roy, a notice was served upon them by Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited (VCPL) stating that it (VCPL) has acquired control of RRPR Holding Private Limited (RRPRH). This entity owns 29.18pc of NDTV. It has been given two days to transfer all its equity shares to VCPL,” an NDTV statement said. It said VCPL has exercised its rights based on a loan agreement it entered with NDTV founders Radhika and Prannoy Roy in 2009-10.
“The NDTV founders and the Company would like to make it clear that this exercise of rights by VCPL was executed without any input from, conversation with, or consent of the NDTV founders, who, like NDTV, have been made aware of this exercise of rights only today. As recently as yesterday, NDTV had informed the stock exchanges that there was no change in the shareholding of its founders.”
On Tuesday, Adani Enterprises announced that it would acquire a 29.18pc stake in the NDTV group through a subsidiary company. The Adani Group said it would also launch an open offer to buy another 26pc of NDTV’s shares. This would effectively give it majority control over one of India’s best-known news brands and among the very few that continue to be critical of the Modi government.
A three-decade old channel, NDTV has been mostly regarded as more open-minded in discussing India’s communal and caste disparities than most others. This, even though its English channel strove to keep the rightwing nationalist government in good humour by inserting extra spokespersons for the BJP, often dressed as neutral analysts, in nationally watched debates. It was the Hindi channel that became the mainstay of the media’s fight for space for criticism and free speech, something the media-shy prime minister appears unprepared to accept. Its main anchor, Ravish Kumar, won the Magsaysay Award for his outspoken analysis of the running story and his in-depth coverage of social and political backstage.
Reports said the seeds for the NDTV’s takeover had been laid almost a decade and a half ago — by Reliance Industries Limited, the conglomerate owned by Mukesh Ambani.
On Tuesday, AMG Media Networks Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, bought 100pc of the equity stakes in Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited for Rs1.13 billion. It is through this company that Adani Enterprises is acquiring NDTV shares. Incor­p­orated in 2008, Vishvap­radhan Commercial Private Limited describes itself as a mana­g­ement and consultancy services company but owns no assets.
According to Scroll.in news portal, in 2009, it had offered an unsecured loan of about Rs4bn to Radhika Roy Prannoy Roy Private Limited, an entity that held a 29pc share of NDTV.
Vishvapradhan Commercial Private Limited had got the money from another company called Shinano Retail Private Limited in the form of another unsecured loan the same financial year.
