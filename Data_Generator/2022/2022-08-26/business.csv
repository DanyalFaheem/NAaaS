0,Pakistan Oilfields finds hydrocarbons in KP,"Production from the well is expected to start from December 2022, it says.","KARACHI: Pakistan Oilfields Ltd (POL) told its shareholders on Thursday that MOL Pakistan, which operates the Tal Block in Kohat district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has encountered hydrocarbons following Drill Stem Tests (DSTs) conducted in the Tolanj West-2 well to measure the potential of Samanasuk, Shinawari and Lockhart formations.
In a regulatory filing, the oil and gas explorer that’s part of the consortium extracting energy from Tal Block said the testing results conveyed a potential of 2.25 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (mmscfd) in the Samanasuk and Shinawari formations and a potential of 8.3mmscfd in the Lockhart formation.
The companies said these formations weren’t hydrocarbon-bearing in the previous well drilled in the Tolanj West field. “Production from the well is expected to start from December 2022,” it said.
A DST is a procedure for isolating and testing the surrounding geological formations through the drill system. The test is a measurement of pressure behaviour at the drill stem and is a way to obtain important fluid sampling information and establish the probability of commercial production.
“It should be borne in mind that actual production may differ significantly from the test results,” the company said.
Meanwhile, the country’s oil reserves in June went down seven per cent year-on-year to 233m barrels. Arif Habib Ltd analyst Muhammad Iqbal Jawaid wrote in a research note on Thursday that the decline in oil reserves came on the back of the reduction in major fields.
Similarly, the country’s gas reserves in June also plunged 7pc on an annual basis to 19,513 billion cubic feet.
Mr Jawaid said oil reserves of Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDC) and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) plunged 9pc and 27pc, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. However, oil reserves of Mari Petroleum Company Ltd showed a surge of 7.6 times on an annual basis.

2,Oil firm on possible Opec+ supply cut,"LONDON: Oil prices firmed on Thursday on the prospect that the Opec+ producer group could curb oil supplies, but the...","LONDON: Oil prices firmed on Thursday on the prospect that the Opec+ producer group could curb oil supplies, but the more bearish possibility of an agreement that would return sanctioned Iranian oil exports to the market capped gains.
Brent crude rose 58 cents, or 0.6 per cent to $101.80 a barrel by 1402 GMT, while US West Texas Intermediate crude firmed 10 cents, or 0.1pc, to $94.99 a barrel.
Comments on Monday by Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman about a disconnect between the futures and physical markets in which he flagged the possibility that Opec+ could cut production helped to push oil prices to three-week highs.
“The suggestion that the price did not align with fundamentals and that Opec+ could cut output has clearly had the desired effect,” Oanda analyst Craig Erlam said.

3,"Alvi stresses usage of tech for harnessing agri, industry potential",Says Pakistan has immense potential to emerge as an economically strong country by adopting IT-based innovative technologies.,"ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi said on Thursday that the application of critical IT-based innovative technologies can lead to harnessing the true potential of the agricultural and industrial sectors and help Pakistan prevent future economic shocks and ensure fast-paced economic growth.
Speaking at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) Achievement Awards ceremony at Aiwan-e-Sadr, President Alvi said Pakistan has immense potential to emerge as an economically strong country by adopting IT-based innovative technologies.
He stated that investing in research and development (R & D) to indigenously invent new products, adding value to its industrial production, and bringing the youth bulge into the economic mainstream by imparting market-oriented skills and knowledge will help significantly increase agricultural yields.
President Alvi praised LCCI’s leadership role in promoting business trade and investment, as well as encouraging women to start businesses and advance to positions of power. LCCI President, Mian Nauman Kabir, senior office holders of the chamber, and members of the business community attended the ceremony.
He said that the continuation of pro-trade, business, and investment policies, the consultative decision-making process at all levels in business-related issues and matters, ensuring ease of doing business, adopting innovative business approaches, and the passion of businesspersons to achieve optimal growth and development were the essential ingredients for attaining financial and economic stability in the country.
He called upon the business community to create a women’s-friendly environment in the business and industrial sectors where their own female family members and other female workers should feel safe and secure to play their roles in the business and economic sectors of the country. He also advised LCCI to create online business and employment opportunities for those qualified women who, for certain reasons, would prefer to work from home.
The president said that the business and industrial sectors would grow faster when we provide them with a corruption-free, safe and secure, and morality-based business environment; settle business trade and investment issues in accordance with the law; and by bringing greater transparency to the economy through documentation and simplifying the systems and processes.
Earlier, LCCI representatives thanked the president for his continuous patronage of the chambers of commerce and industries and said that, under his advice, the chamber was taking proactive steps to recruit women in the business and industrial sector at all levels.

4,Biden signs $52bn aid for chip manufacturing,The  “Chips and Science” law also includes an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden on Thursday signed an executive order on implementation of the $52.7 billion semiconductor chips manufacturing subsidy and research law, the White House said. 
Earlier this month, Biden signed the bill to boost efforts to make the United States more competitive with China’s science and technology efforts. By subsidizing US chip manufacturing and expanding research funding, the law aims to alleviate a persistent shortage that has affected everything from cars and weapons to washing machines and video games.
The  “Chips and Science” law also includes an investment tax credit for chip plants estimated to be worth $24 billion.
The White House said the Commerce Department launched CHIPS.gov. The department will make funding awards for chips production. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the department has been preparing for months for the program.
“We are committed to a process that is transparent and fair,” Raimondo said.  “We will move as swiftly as possible to deploy these funds, while also ensuring the time needed to perform due diligence.”

5,"Monsoon devastation hits crops, may affect economic outlook",Finance ministry report says heavy crop losses expected as provinces assess damages.,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Finance on Thursday cautioned that heavy monsoon rains have  adversely affected major and minor crops, which may impact the country’s agricultural performance and its overall economic  outlook.
The torrential  rains and floods during July and August have adversely affected  the standing kharif crops, especially cotton. Assessment of  the crop damages was in progress by the provinces, but significant  losses could be witnessed, said the Economic Adviser’s Wing (EAW) of the  Ministry of Finance in its Economic Update and Outlook for  August.
It said the present situation depicts inundated  cotton fields mostly in Sindh, Balochistan and southern districts of  Punjab.
Global and domestic uncertainties surround the economic outlook. Geopolitical tensions remain unabated, worldwide  inflation remains high, interest rates show tendencies to rise, and the  US dollar strengthens. Pakistan’s external environment is, therefore, facing increasing challenges. Domestically, the government has taken  necessary measures to comply with International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) requirements.

Finance ministry report says heavy crop losses expected as provinces assess damages

The update said these have further increased inflation but also have the positive  effect of alleviating the external financing constraints. The months of  June and July witnessed a significant year-on-year increase in inflation due to the higher global commodity prices and rupee depreciation.
The inflationary pressure may continue in the current month, even if there would be no further month-on-month increase in inflation, as prices  of essential items are significantly higher than the last year. 
On the other hand, during the last 12 months, money supply  growth was compatible with a low and stable inflation rate. But the  recent supply shocks have brought the CPI to a level much higher than  a year ago.
Taking into account, the expectation that domestic  retail prices may further increase compared to July,  even if there would not be another month-on-month increase in August, the year-on-year inflation will settle at nearly the same level as observed in  July.
As expected, the large-scale manufacturing (LSM) output stabilised in June as compared  to May and its year-on-year growth rate remained on a positive trend. In July,  international economic slowdown and domestic negative seasonal effects  may drag down LSM compared to its June level. However, on a year-on-year basis, LSM may stabilise or show limited growth.
The report said inflation has continued to accelerate in recent  months, mainly due to supply shocks that have created significant  monthly impulses on the CPI level. If these monthly impulses can be  contained to more normal levels in the coming months, inflation may start to  decelerate. But even then, year-on-year inflation may stay in double digits for  the rest of the ongoing fiscal year.
Economic growth remains positive. But  restrictive demand management and high inflation may cause Pakistan’s  cyclical position to deteriorate in the coming months. This cooling off  may bode well for the trade balance and by extension for the current  account balance, official reserves, and the exchange rate.
On the other hand, recessionary tendencies in major markets of Pakistani goods may contain exports. Besides, Pakistan’s rupee has significantly  depreciated in recent months, and it appreciated again in June. The  current account balance is expected to improve considerably in the  coming months.
The new agreement with the IMF ensures that Pakistan’s external financing needs will be met. This opens room for  further implementation of supply-side policies that should elevate  Pakistan’s potential growth rate to a higher sustainable level. 
One  essential necessary condition for this to happen is a drastic increase  in Pakistan’s propensity to invest. Physical and human capital  accumulation and productivity enhancement are the essential ingredients  to upgrade Pakistan’s sustainable long-run growth path, the report said.

6,"Foreign currencies dry up, rupee continues to fall",SBP reserves drop $87m to $7.8bn.,"KARACHI: Almost all foreign currencies have disappeared from the open market, with citizens struggling to get hold of the dollar even at Rs230.
In the interbank market, the rupee continued to fall for the fourth session in a row, losing 0.47 per cent to close at 219.41 on Thursday.
The open market quoted the dollar at about Rs10 higher than the interbank market, currency dealers said, as all foreign currencies were in short supply, including the dollar, Saudi riyal and UAE dirham.
Bankers also questioned the official price of Rs219.41, claiming that the dollar was changing hands at much higher rates among banks.

SBP reserves drop $87m to $7.8bn

They pointed out that when the dollar reached a peak of Rs239.5 in the interbank market last month, banks were charging in the range of Rs245 to Rs248. Bankers also said they were facing pressure to artificially maintain the dollar rate on the lower side.
In the open market, the trade has shrunk by nearly ten times, according to forex firms.
“We were selling $25 to $30 million a day in the banks just a couple of weeks ago, but it has now fallen to $3 to $4 million,” said Zafar Paracha, general secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
He said most citizens were not currently selling their foreign exchange holdings in the open market, as “a strong grey market” had emerged, which was buying the dollar at a much higher rate of Rs235 while “we are buying at 227.50”.
Besides, smuggling into Afghanistan is another factor that has yet to be controlled. In Kabul, the dollar is selling for an equivalent of about Rs240, attracting smugglers to make a quick buck.
Many currency dealers partially held the government responsible for the recent hike in the dollar as it allowed the import of luxury, or non-essential, items.
They said the government’s permission to allow luxury imports helped stoke up dollar demand in the interbank market, which ultimately affected the open market as well.
After the government’s decision to allow luxury imports, the dollar has appreciated by at least Rs10. It is believed that the government received negative signals from stakeholders of the economy pointing towards slowing growth.
Despite this, the SBP acting governor recently said that Pakistan had arranged more dollars than it required during the current fiscal year.
“While importers are in search of dollars, exporters have held back their proceeds and waiting for further appreciation to get maximum returns,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market.
Another currency dealer said the SBP recently allowed exchange companies to export dollars, which has also resulted in a shortage of dollars in the open market.
SBP reserves down $87m
The SBP’s foreign exchange reserves dropped $87 million to $7.809 billion during the week ended on Aug 19, central bank data showed on Thursday.
Reserves of commercial banks now stand at $5.711bn, making the country’s total reserves at $13.521bn.
