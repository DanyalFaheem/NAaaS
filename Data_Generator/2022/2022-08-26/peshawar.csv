Officails said that elders of Kabulkhel, Janikhel, Bakakhel, Madakhel, Haiderkhel, Zoi Saidgi and Dawager Saidgi held two jirgas with General Officer Commanding Maj-Gen Mohammad Naeem Akhter and Deputy Commissioner Shahid Ali Khan in Miramshah on Thursday and apprised them of their problems. 
One of the demands was to allow local people to harvest pine nuts in the natural forests in Shawal, Haiderkhel, Madakhel and Zoi Saidgi forests near the Afghan border. 
They said pine nuts were the only source of income for local people and the administration should withdraw the ban. The authorities had banned entry of tribal people into the pine forests after militancy in the area. 
Another demand was the relaxation of the border at Ghulam Khan checkpost to facilitate the people’s movement. 
Maj-Gen Naeem Akhtar assured the elders that the government would ensure safe return of the people of North Waziristan from Afghanistan. 
He said that 8,000 families had been repatriated so far and that the remaining families would be brought back very soon.
Regarding access to forests, he said pine nuts were ready for harvesting and the government would be allowed to harvest the crop. He said labourers would also be allowed to stay in the forests to harvest pine nuts.

The convict claimed that he was in love with his female cousin but was annoyed with her as she was talking to other men by telephone. He stated that on the day of occurrence, he killed his cousin and as her mother and nephew were also at home, therefore, he had also to kill them.

4,Tribunal rejects plea against Imran’s candidature for Mardan NA by-poll,Voter had accused PTI chief of concealing Toshakhana gifts and assets.,"PESHAWAR: An appellate tribunal on Thursday upheld the candidature of former prime minister and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan for a vacant National Assembly seat from Mardan district and rejected an appeal seeking his disqualification from contesting the NA-22 by-election.
Peshawar High Court Justice Ijaz Anwar of a single-member tribunal pronounced a short order for it after lawyers for Mr Imran, appellant and Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) completed arguments.
The appeal was filed by a NA-22 voter, Ali Haider, who wanted the tribunal to set aside the acceptance by his constituency’s returning officer of the PTI chief’s nomination papers and declare that the PTI chief is not qualified to become a member of the National Assembly.
The appellant had claimed that Mr Imran concealed information about the toshakhana gifts he kept as well as other assets in his annual income tax returns; received prohibited funds in the name of his party; did not disclose details of the assets of the Al-Qadir University Project Trust to which he and his wife were trustees, and didn’t mention in the nomination papers several criminal cases registered against him.

Voter had accused PTI chief of concealing toshakhana gifts and assets

The appellant also contended that the respondent (Mr Imran) did not disclose why he wanted to contest by-elections from NA-22 and eight other constituencies despite already receiving salary as an MNA.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared for Mr Imran and insisted his client was no longer an MNA.
He said his client had resigned as an MNA and his resignation letter was accepted by the former speaker but couldn’t be sent to the ECP due to some technical reasons.
The lawyer contended that under Article 223 of the Constitution, a candidate was allowed to contest for more than one seats of the assembly but had to retain a single seat after polls.
He argued that Mr Imran had retained 11 toshakhana gifts and deposited the required amount as per the relevant policy.
Barrister Gohar said the amount of those gifts was not concealed and instead, his client had mentioned it in his income tax returns for the financial year 2019-20.
He said his client had received 329 gifts as the prime minister but retained only 11 by depositing the required amount.
The lawyer alleged that there were instances in past when the rulers had retained expensive gifts including cars and had not deposited a single penny in return.
About concealment of criminal cases, Barrister Gohar contended that under the Elections Act a candidate had to mention cases registered six months prior to the submission of nomination papers which was Feb 17 in the case.
He added that the cases referred by the appellant were registered after that date so under the law mentioning those was not mandatory.
The counsel contended that Mr Imran was only a trustee in Al-Qadir Trust and under the law a trustee did not receive any benefit, therefore, it was not mandatory for him to declare the assets of the said trust.
Moreover, he argued that the appeal was not maintainable as the appellate had field objection with the RO after acceptance of Mr Imran’s nomination papers.
ECP counsel Mohsin Kamran Siddique and senior law officer Riaz Khattak also contended that the objection raised by the appellant was time barred and the appeal was not maintainable.
The appellant’s counsel contended that perusal of income tax returns of Mr Imran for the financial year 2018-19 and 2019-20 revealed that he concealed the valuable assets acquired from toshakhana during the period 2018 to 2020.
The lawyer alleged that Mr Imran, with mala fide intentions, had concealed the gifts, which he discretely acquired after entering the office of prime minister, from the public eye, the ECP and the Federal Board of Revenue.
He alleged that the candidate and his spouse procured 52 items in the form of gifts from August 2018 to December 2021. He alleged that the total assessed value of the valuable assets was Rs142 million whereas the candidate paid only Rs38.98 million and retained the gifts but never disclosed those gifts.
Also, the tribunal rejected two appeals filed by former MNA Shaukat Ali for the rejection of nomination papers of independent candidates Shaukat Ali and Emran Khan for NA-31, Peshawar, by-election.
PTI leader Shaukat Ali is the covering candidate of party chief Imran Khan for by-election in that constituency.
The appellant’s counsel contended that the two candidates had not properly filled their nomination papers and left several of the portions blank, which was violation of the Elections Act.

They said Tarbela Dam, a lifeline of the country’s electricity system, was built in Swabi district andthe government should withdraw FPA and give 50 per cent rebate in the bills to people of the district.

8,Govt surpasses polio vaccination target in North Waziristan,Authorities still face daunting task of dealing with refusal cases,"PESHAWAR: Authorities in North Waziristan district, which is home to 13 polio cases of the countrywide 14 recorded so far this year, have surpassed the vaccination target while some districts, especially Peshawar, continue to record refusals against the drops.
The 10-day polio campaign was started in six districts on August 15 to target 1,058,067 children for oral polio vaccines (OPV) and 994,583 for fractional dose of inactivated polio vaccine (fIPV) to boost their immunity against the virus.
On the second day of the drive, two policemen guarding the vaccinators were killed by unidentified attackers in Tank district. In each and every campaign, unidentified armed men carry out attacks on polio teams and vanish from the scene.
A month before during a special drive in North Waziristan, two person associated with vaccination were killed and another was seriously wounded. However, officials said that they immunised 105 per cent children despite the fear that gripped the health workers.

Authorities still face daunting task of dealing with refusal cases

They attributed the success of the vaccination drive to the bravery of health workers and tight security measures taken by the administration along with support of community.
North Waziristan is in the spotlight as it has reported 13 polio cases this year. One case was detected in Lakki Marwat. Average of the vaccinated children in six districts for OPV remained 99 per cent including Dera Ismail Khan with 107 per cent, Bannu with 92 per cent, Tank and South with 95 per cent, North Waziristan with 105 per cent and Lakki Marwat with 95 per cent while the overall IPV target was recorded 106 per cent.
Authorities are, however, still facing the daunting challenge to deal with refusal cases. The campaign started in 29 districts on August 22 is still ongoing but as per data recorded so far, the provincial capital has enlisted 8,165 refusal cases.
Officials say that some of the refusal cases would be covered during the ongoing drive but the issue of vaccine hesitancy has been a chronic problem in Peshawar, which is among the seven cities having poliovirus in sewage water samples. Bannu, Nowshera and Swat are other positive districts of the total seven in the country.
So far, a total of 27,131 refusal cases have been recorded in the province and all would be administered vaccine after intervention by district administration and community leaders. However, even a few refusals are not acceptable and vaccination of 100 per cent target children is mandatory for eradication of the virus.
Officials said that certain chronic pickets posed serious challenge to the vaccinators because only one unvaccinated child could be transmitter of the virus. So far, Khyber has recorded 3,718 refusal cases, Mardan 2,000, Kohat 1,178 and Orakzai has registered 2,111 refusal cases along with other districts.
The missed children in another area also hamper the campaign. A report said that 323,788 children were bracketed as missed because they were not available during door-to-door visit by health workers. This number can also be brought down but still a small number of children would stay unimmunised, posing potential threat to the national efforts against the vaccine-preventable childhood ailment.
Paediatricians said that the government should handle the issue of missed children and refusal cases administratively. Health workers and the social mobilisers are trying their level best to convince the parents but they can face hardcore elements, who consider polio immunisation a plot hatched by the US and West to render recipients of the vaccine impotent and infertile.
The health experts said that immunisation was successful in eradication of poliovirus from the countries, except Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both the neighbouring countries encountered identical problems, they said.
