0,Construction activity likely to gain momentum before winter,"Expensive building material, devastating floods blamed for slowdown in July-Aug.","KARACHI: The construction slump, caused by unprecedented monsoon rains and subsequent flood devastation, is about to be over as all players await the receding of floodwater and restoration of the road network to start rebuilding activities across the country.
Stakeholders, however, say reconstruction has already started in some of the flood-hit areas, but on a limited scale due to disruption in the supply of building material.
Association of Builders and Developers Association (Abad) Chairman  Hanif Memon said construction activities shrank 35-40 per cent in the last two months which led to a 34pc drop in overall cement sales in July-August. Also, Amreli Steels Ltd (ASL) closed its plant from Aug 31 to Sept 19 due to low demand for steel bars on account of unprecedented monsoon rains and flash floods.
“Almost 35pc of workers have been sitting idle due to massive slowdown in construction activities,” he said, adding that builders in Sindh have yet not started construction of their high-rise projects due to uncertain situation after rains and floods.

Expensive building material, devastating floods blamed for slowdown in July-Aug

“Punjab-based workers have returned to their homes while some of those belonging to Sindh have also gone back after floods have devastated their homes. This has also affected construction work in Karachi,” Mr Hanif said, adding that a high-rise project generates at least 100 jobs, which means 100 families earn their livelihood from a single venture.
He said the association was trying to hold a meeting with the federal government to discuss steps in reducing the high cost of construction due to the massive hike in steel bars, cement and other construction materials.
For example, he said, the price of crush was now Rs80 per cubic foot compared to Rs42-43 earlier while Reti was available at Rs53 per cubic foot versus Rs28-30. Similarly, cement costs over Rs1,000 per 50kg bag while steel bars sell for around Rs220,000 a tonne.
The country still faced a dearth of one million units a year as against construction of only 350,000-400,000 units, he added.
To address the grievances of flood victims, Abad has engaged consultants for preparing models of a “modern village” based on rooms measuring 12x14 feet, which would cost around Rs150,000 depending on the fibre and aluminium sheets, bamboo, etc.
He said Abad was trying to get this project done with the help of federal and provincial governments.
Mr Hanif said construction activity, which he said was already in decline, would also remain subdued during winter.
“I cannot say when the construction activities will revive at full pace and how much time floodwater will take to recede,” he added.
Growing demand
Attock Cement Ltd General Manager Irfan Amanullah while giving a different view, anticipated additional cement demand for five to seven million tonnes and 800,000 tonnes of steel bars after 45 days. As per estimates, floods had swept away 2.5 to three million houses.
He said investors and people in Swat would start rebuilding their hotels, houses and other structures in view of the winter tourism season.
He said cement sales during July-August mainly remained depressed because of monsoon rains and floods instead of any price issue.
He said buyers or contractors could only postpone cement purchase for a limited time due to seasonal factors but they could not cancel the purchase as they have to complete the work even with low-priced cement. 
“It’s a temporary phase and the situation would be different after 45 days. Cement sales are going on even at a price of over Rs1,000 per 50kg,” he observed.
He said it seemed that a robust market change was coming up and people were accepting the structural reforms taken by the government.
“In my view, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail is taking tough decisions under tremendous pressure and the business community and people are understanding the gravity of the situation by accepting them.” 
He was of the view that the finance minister was fully prepared to take up the challenge and he was taking the tough decisions despite immense political pressure, “which is a very good sign”. 
Revival begins
Wajid Bukhari, secretary general of the Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers, said construction work had resumed in Punjab and Islamabad after rains stopped while in Sindh and Balochistan, the situation was different due to issues in steel bars and cement transportation.
“I think construction activities will pick up pace in the entire country after the end of a rain spell forecasted in mid-September,” he said.
Mr Bukhari said builders and contractors would try to complete their projects from September to November before peak winter.
As for additional demand for steel bars during the revival phase, he said the demand would not be robust owing to the low Public Sector Development Programme allocations and until big private projects came into full swing.
He said the last four months remained uneasy for the steel bar makers due to high raw material prices, a drop in production and a slowdown in construction activities.
“I think the overall situation will improve in FY23, especially after the start of repair work in Balochistan, Sindh and Swat mainly,” he said.

1,"Real freedom is economic self-reliance, says Miftah","Accuses his predecessor, Shaukat Tarin, of not stating facts.","ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said  on Saturday real freedom meant economic self-reliance, without which the concept of  freedom and self-reliance was not achieved.
While accusing his  predecessor Shaukat Tarin of “not stating facts”, Mr Ismail told a press conference the PTI government took 79  per cent of external debt out of the total debt taken in the country’s  history. 
He said during the PTI tenure, Pakistan’s imports jumped to record $80  billion while the trade deficit reached an unprecedented $48bn in FY22.  
Reacting to Mr Tarin’s presser at a Karachi Press Club early in the day, Mr Miftah wondered how PTI could talk about real freedom without achieving economic self-sufficiency.

Accuses Tarin of not stating facts

Earlier, Mr Tarin advised the PMLN-led coalition government to approach Russia for oil “that’s available at a discount of 30-40pc”. 
Mr Ismail said the former PTI government was leading the country towards  default and the 13-party administration saved it country from bankruptcy. 
“We have saved the country from Sri Lanka-like situation, where petrol and gas are blacking out,” he said. 
He said the PTI made agreements with the IMF to make electricity and oil  more expensive, the effect of which continued even during our  government’s tenure. PTI government raised Rs19,000bn in  loans in its tenure, he added.
The minister said the country was passing through a critical  juncture after the floods while the PTI was investing $25,000 per month for lobbying which is against the national interest in the current situation. He said former Prime Minister Imran Khan did not fulfil any of his promises, including the construction of five million houses.
The  finance minister mai­n­tained that the government was distributing Rs25,000 to 4m families each in the flood-hit areas at the total cost  of Rs70bn.
Cotton, sugarcane and date crops had been destroyed in Sindh, Mr Ismail said, adding that the governm­ent would import tomatoes and onions from Turkiye  and Afg­hanistan and that inf­lation would be controlled in the next  couple of months.

2,Service exports post paltry growth in July,"In absolute terms, the value of export of services reached $530 million in July from $491m a year ago.","ISLAMABAD: The export of services grew nearly eight per cent in July, the first month of the current fiscal year, mainly driven by IT proceeds.
In absolute terms, the value of export of services reached $530 million in July from $491m a year ago, according to the latest data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
On a month-on-month basis, the export of services dipped by 16.51pc in July. 
The export of services grew 17.20pc to $6.968bn between July-June 2021-22 from $5.945bn in the preceding year.
The government has projected $10bn for the services sector and a $35bn merchandise export target for 2022-23.
The highest-ever growth in IT-related services pushed up the overall export figure. Services exports also include finance and insurance, transport and storage, wholesale and retail trade, public administration and defence sectors.
For promoting IT exports, the Pakistan Software Board has created an entire IT Export Strategical Framework and is executing different programmes and schemes accordingly through a series of projects in infrastructure development, human capital development, company capability development, global marketing, strategy and research, and promotion of innovation and technologies.
The services sector has emerged as the main economic growth driver by contributing 61pc to GDP in 2020-21 from 56pc in 2005-06.
The import of services posted a meagre growth of 1.53pc to $789.93m in July against $778.05m over the corresponding month of last year. On a month-on-month basis, imports plunged by 40.02pc in July.
In the previous fiscal year, the import of services rose 43.52pc to $12.143bn against $8.461bn in the corresponding months last year.
The trade deficit in services declined by 9.48pc to $259.86m in July against $287.06m in the corresponding month last year. In FY22, the gap widened by 105.73pc to $5.175bn against $2.515bn in FY21.

3,"Russia, West step up energy war",Moscow has announced it will keep its main gas pipeline to Germany shut.,"KYIV: Stepping up an energy war between Russia and the West, Moscow has announced it will keep its main gas pipeline to Germany shut and G7 countries said they planned a price cap on Russian oil exports.
The standoff over Russian gas and oil exports is a fallout from President Vladimir Putin’s six-month invasion of Ukraine, underscoring the deep rift it has caused between Moscow and Western nations.
Russia’s defence ministry meanwhile accused Ukrainian forces on Saturday of mounting a failed attempt to capture the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that has been a centre of international concern in recent weeks.
The ministry said a Ukrainian naval force of more than 250 troops attempted to land on the coast of a lake near the plant, which is Europe’s largest nuclear energy station.
“Despite the presence of representatives of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the Kyiv regime once again attempted to seize the plant,” the defence ministry said.
Reuters was unable to verify the report.
Kyiv and Moscow have traded accusations about attacks on the power plant, which was captured by Russian forces in March but is connected to the Ukrainian power grid and still operated by Ukrainian staff.
A team of IAEA inspectors arrived at the plant on Thursday to assess its safety. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi, after returning to Ukrainian-held territory, said the physical integrity of the plant had been violated several times.
On Friday Grossi said he expects to produce a report on the safety of the plant early next week, and two experts from the IAEA inspections team would stay on at the plant for the longer term.
A reactor at the site was reconnected to Ukraine’s grid on Friday, a day after it shut down due to shelling nearby, Ukraine’s state nuclear company Energoatom said.
Ukraine and the West have said Russia is using the site as a base for heavy weapons in a move to discourage Ukraine from firing on it. Russia has so far resisted international calls to pull troops out of the plant and demilitarise the area.
Russia’s Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu on Friday denied Russia had heavy weapons at or near the power plant and accused Ukraine of committing  “nuclear terrorism” through its attacks on the facility.
Turkey offered on Saturday to facilitate the Zaporizhzhia situation.
Gas and oil
In its announcement on Friday that it would not resume shipments through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as had been expected, Russia’s state-controlled energy giant Gazprom blamed a technical fault.
Gazprom said on Saturday that Siemens Energy was ready to help repair broken equipment but that there was nowhere available to carry out the work. Siemens said it has not been commissioned to carry out maintenance work for the pipeline but it is available.
Nord Stream 1, which runs under the Baltic Sea to supply Germany and others, had been due to resume operating after a three-day halt for maintenance on Saturday at 0100 GMT.
Moscow has blamed sanctions imposed by the West after Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine for hampering routine operations and maintenance of Nord Stream 1. Brussels and Washington accuse Russia of using gas as an economic weapon.
The indefinite delay to resuming gas deliveries will deepen Europe’s problems securing fuel for winter with living costs already surging, led by energy prices.
Finance ministers from the Group of Seven wealthy democracies - Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - said on Friday a cap on the price of Russian oil was meant to  “reduce ... Russia’s ability to fund its war of aggression whilst limiting the impact of Russia’s war on global energy prices”.
The Kremlin - which calls the conflict  “a special military operation” — said it would stop selling oil to any countries that implemented the cap.

5,Stocks stay depressed in jittery week,"The benchmark index closed at 42,309 points after shedding 282 points or 0.7pc from a week ago.","KARACHI: The stock market remained jittery in the outgoing week while showing a mixed trend.
It commenced on a negative note amid concerns over the devastation wrought by the floods and its economic consequences, said Arif Habib Ltd.
However, the market soon recovered following the approval and subsequent disbursement of a $1.17 billion tranche by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). This led to the rupee gaining strength against the greenback and closing the week at 218.98, up 0.8 per cent from the preceding week.
The bullish trend proved short-lived as the announcement of inflation figures for August clocked in at a 47-year high. In addition, trade numbers released during the week also dampened the overall sentiment because the gap between import and exports jumped 29pc on a month-on-month basis in August.
As a result, the benchmark index closed at 42,309 points after shedding 282 points or 0.7pc from a week ago.
Sector-wise negative contributions came from banking (118 points), exploration and production (90 points), automobile assembling (61 points), miscellaneous (40 points) and textile composite (31 points).
Sectors that contributed positively were cement (110 points) and leather and tanneries (25 points).
Scrip-wise, negative contributors were Habib Bank Ltd (73 points), TRG Pakistan Ltd (47 points), Pakistan Services Ltd (41 points), Engro Corporation (39 points) and Pakistan Oilfields Ltd (36 points).
Meanwhile, scrip-wise positive contribution came from Systems Ltd (76 points), Engro Fertilisers Ltd (48 points), Kohat Cement Company Ltd (32 points), Faysal Bank Ltd (31 points) and Service Industries Ltd (25 points).
Foreigners selling continued in the outgoing week and clocked in at $0.74 million versus to a net sale of $1.87m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in commercial banks ($1.8m) and power ($0.8m). On the local front, buying was reported by banks ($3m) and individuals ($2.4m).
The average daily trading volume clocked in at 211m shares, down 15pc from a week ago. The average daily value traded settled at $31m, down 15pc from the preceding week.
According to AKD Securities, impending near-term inflation is expected to wreak havoc, especially on the food/energy front, leading to overall shaky sentiments. “Until foreign exchange reserves come to a more secure position (import cover currently stands at 1.1 times), the domestic currency is expected to remain volatile, subsequently keeping investor confidence muted,” it said.

6,Market mayhem awaits Britain’s new premier,"LONDON: Liz Truss, on course to become Britain’s prime minister on Monday, looks set to walk straight into a...","LONDON: Liz Truss, on course to become Britain’s prime minister on Monday, looks set to walk straight into a financial market firestorm that she will have to act fast to extinguish.
The pound had its worst month against the dollar in August since shortly after the Brexit referendum in 2016 and fell against the euro too. Some British government bonds suffered their biggest price losses in decades.
Much of the market turmoil is due to a surging inflation rate which is the highest among Group of Seven economies. Goldman Sachs says it could hit 22 per cent if the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on gas prices does not fade.
Many investors are also alarmed that tax cuts promised by Truss could aggravate Britain’s inflation problem, speeding up the Bank of England’s interest rate hikes and worsening a recession that the BoE expects to start this year and end only in 2024.
As well as tax cuts, Truss has recently promised  “robust” direct cost-of-living help for households which would put more strain on the budget deficit.
Then there are her plans to rethink the way the BoE does its job and to be ready to risk a post-Brexit trade war with the European Union.
“I think the UK and the gilt market are in a degree of danger,” Mike Riddell, a senior fixed income portfolio manager at Allianz Global Investors in London, said.
He pointed to sharp falls in recent weeks in the prices of British government bonds, or gilts, and the value of sterling, a rare occurrence.
Normally, the prospect of higher BoE interest rates would hurt demand for bonds while pushing up the pound but the currency is down 15pc against the US dollar so far this year.
Until August, there had never been a month when sterling fell by as much as 4.5pc against the dollar and 10-year gilt yields rose by more than 90 basis points, according to Refinitiv and Bank of England data going back to 1971 when sterling floated.
“The breakdown in the relationship between gilt yields and sterling is indicative of overseas investors losing confidence in the UK, and that is what is really worrying,” Riddell said.
Opinion polls have given Truss — currently Britain’s foreign minister — a big lead over Rishi Sunak, who quit as finance minister in July to contest the Conservative Party leadership race which ends on Monday with an announcement of the winner.
As a former chief secretary to the Treasury, Truss says she knows how to shake up economic orthodoxy by cutting Britain’s tax burden which is heading for a 70-year high.
Sunak has dismissed her tax cut plans as  “fairy tales” which will fuel inflation.
Asset management firm Pictet said this week it was underweight on gilts due to the risk of a big stimulus push which could force the BoE to accelerate its rate hikes.
Julian Jessop, an economist who backs Truss and is close to her advisers, said the idea of borrowing more now to speed up future economic growth made sense.
“In these circumstances, you need to be bold and flexible on fiscal policy and if that means that in the short term the budget deficit has to take strain, then so be it,” he said.
Britain’s public finances are weighed down by the government’s huge coronavirus spending spree.
Public debt as a share of economic output is not far off 100pc, up from about 80pc before pandemic.
But Jessop, a fellow at the Institute for Economic Affairs think-tank, said Truss was probably looking at extra borrowing in the tens of billions of pounds, far less than during the Covid-19 pandemic, something financial markets could swallow.
“Once she actually gets the keys to Number 10 (Downing Street) then she can start reassuring markets about what she actually intends to do,” he said.
