0,Manchhar Lake water reaches ‘dangerous level’,"Residents of five union councils told to evacuate immediately; ""more thundershowers"" forecast in coming days.","• Residents of five UCs told to evacuate immediately
• ‘More thundershowers’ forecast in coming days
DADU / HYDERABAD / RAWALPINDI: With water level in Sindh’s Manchhar Lake rising to ‘dangerous level’ and the forecast of more thundershowers in the upper parts of the country during the next three to four days, residents of at least five union councils near the lake have been asked to immediately move to safer places arranged by the Jamshoro administration. 
The increasing levels in Manchhar posed a serious threat to scores of surrounding villages after the deluge completely cut off Bajera and Jhangara villages in Dadu from the rest of the district. Floodwater gushing from the lake was mounting pressure on the embankments of Danister canal and its main regulator, which has been damaged.
Official in charge of the irrigation cell for Manchhar Lake Sher Mohammad Mallah said water level crossed the full capacity level of 122.8 feet RL at RD-62 point. An inflow of over 100,000 cusecs was being recorded while the discharge into the Indus River stood at 7,000 to 8,000 cusecs at Aral canal and its tail-end near Sehwan, according to irrigation engineer Mahesh Kumar. 
He said truckloads of stones were being brought to strengthen the weak sections of Manchhar’s bank, while floodwater had started eroding its bank at RD-100, 72, 62, 52 and 10 points on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Met Office has forecast that upper regions of the country may receive thundershowers for the next three to four days, though Sindh, Balochistan and south Punjab are expected to experience hot and humid weather during these days.
Talking to Dawn over the phone from Manchhar, Jamshoro Deputy Commissioner Fariduddin Mustafa said 80 per cent residents from two of the five union councils had already left, while the remaining were advised to leave in view of the critical condition of the lake’s dyke. They were being provided shelter in government buildings though private places might also be acquired to accommodate more people, he said.
He said soil erosion between RD-54 and RD-58 of the lake could be detrimental to the dyke. He quoted Irrigation Special Secretary Jamal Mangan as saying the critical situation was reported on Saturday evening due to the wind at the dyke. 
Meanwhile, the flood rushing to other parts of Dadu continued to increase pressure on the embankment protecting Mehar Town, which had been cut off from rest of the towns for past five days due to inundation and destruction of roads.
The worst-hit town of Khairpur Nathan Shah continued to receive more floodwater, causing the 10-foot water level recorded a day earlier to rise by at least another foot. The major town of Johi also remained cut off from all other areas of the district due to heavy flooding.
Breaches at 20 sections of the Nara Valley Drain dykes had also aggravated the flood situation at Kheer Mori and adversely affected the areas up to Chhandan Mori towards Sehwan over the last 24 hours though residents of the affected areas plugged the breaches on their own.
The LS Bund near Dadu remained under immense pressure of floodwater.
Moreover, five members of a family drowned in the floodwater of the Indus near Alipur where they had gone to take photos. Jamshoro DC Mustafa and SSP Javed Baloch said all the five bodies had been recovered. Locals had tried to convince them against going further near the water, Khanote SHO Deedar Hussain said, adding that their bodies were later shifted to Liaquat University Hospital, Jamshoro branch.
According to the Met Office, weak monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea were penetrating upper and central parts of the country. 
Under the influence of this weather system, rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is expected in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Islamabad/Rawalpindi, Murree, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Sialkot, Narowal, Lahore, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sheikhupura, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Jhang and Faisalabad from Saturday night to Tuesday.
It further said rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is also expected in Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Malakand, Bajaur, Peshawar, Mardan, Charsadda, Swabi, Nowshera, Kurram, Kohat and Waziristan on Sunday (today) and Monday.

1,Tarin wants govt to seek fiscal space from IMF for flood relief,KARACHI: Former fina­nce minister and PTI Sena­tor Shaukat Tarin asked the government on Saturday to immediately...,"KARACHI: Former fina­nce minister and PTI Sena­tor Shaukat Tarin asked the government on Saturday to immediately seek fiscal space of Rs2 trillion to Rs2.5tr from the Internat­ional Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide flood victims with relief in the short term.
Speaking at a press conference, Mr Tarin said the government should also approach Russia for oil supplies that’re available at a discount of “30-40 per cent”. 
“You can always swap Russian oil in the international market,” he said while responding to a question about the compatibility of Russian oil with the refineries operating in Pakistan.
“They should tell the United States that people need relief after the floods. They should announce targeted subsidies,” he said.
Mr Tarin criticised the powers that be for “leaking” the audio of a controversial phone conversation hours before the IMF board meeting. He alleged that people responsible for the leak wanted to jeopardise the IMF deal, which led to the disbursement of a $1.17bn loan tranche and paved the way for additional dollar inflows from other bilateral and multilateral sources.
“Who leaked the tapes? We did not. We didn’t make the tapes, so how would we leak them?” he asked.
On Monday, two audio clips surfaced on social media in which a man, said to be Mr Tarin, can be heard directing the finance ministers of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab to tell the federal government and IMF that they wouldn’t be able to commit to a provincial budget surplus in view of the devastation caused by the floods.
“We decided this was not the time to release that letter… So were we jeopardising the programme or you? You could’ve done it on Tuesday… Why did you do it just before the meeting?”
Expressing disappointment at the accusations of being a traitor, Mr Tarin said it was time all the political parties, including the PTI, moved past it. “In a democracy, you have the freedom to voice both agreement and dissent.
“We have a disaster in front of us and it calls for us to unite and fight it together,” he said.
“I am seeing that our common folk will see more burden in the upcoming days because they’ll increase taxes and it’ll have a ripple effect […] and the reason is that they have accepted IMF’s special conditionalities,” he pointed out, citing increasing inflation and appreciating dollar.
Senator Tarin lamented the premature ouster of PTI from power in April as it was set to grow tax revenue to Rs8tr. “They’ll take the collection to barely Rs7.5tr after imposing so many taxes. We would’ve used the additional Rs500 billion to Rs1tr on relief efforts,” he added.
He said the ideal way forward is replacing the incumbent government with an interim setup that enjoys across-the-board political support. “Whether by-elections can be held amid the floods is a moot point,” he said, adding that the government should accept Imran Khan’s offer to raise and distribute funds for flood-affected people.

2,Amnesty asks India to end oppression in held Kashmir,Urges world to hold Modi government accountable for human rights violations...,"ISLAMABAD: Amnesty Inter­na­­tional has called on the Indian government to end the repression of rights in India-held Kashmir (IHK), release those arbitrarily de­tained and ensure they are tried promptly and fairly in a regular court. 
The AI urged the international community to hold India accountable for human rights violations. 
The AI in its report, titled “We are being punished by the law: Three years since abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir”, stated that the Indian government’s efforts to put in place unlawful surveillance measures, arbitrary detention, and restrictions to freedom of expression and simultaneously conceal its actions in occupied Jammu and Kashmir clearly violated international human rights law.
The Indian government was further asked to drop all politically motivated charges against journalists and human rights defenders, arrested for exercising their freedom of expression, and remove the unjust barriers placed on the people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir from expressing themselves freely and provide them access to meaningful remedy and justice. It must also take steps to increase representation and participation of the people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir in decision-making processes, stated the report that was released on Friday. 

Urges world to hold Modi government accountable for human rights violations

Also, the international community was urged to hold the Indian government accountable for the human rights violations in occupied Jammu and Kashmir by calling for an immediate and independent investigation into such violations, not the least because it reflects so poorly that a member of the UN Human Rights Council is acting with such impunity.
“For three years now, civil society and media in Jammu and Kashmir have been subjected to a vicious crackdown by the Indian government, which is determined to stifle dissent using draconian laws, policies and unlawful practices in their arsenal,” said Aakar Patel, chair of the board of Amnesty International India.
“By harassing and intimidating critical voices, authorities are targeting all credible, independent sources of information in and about Jammu and Kashmir. There is a silence achieved on all dissent through heavy handed repression which has spread fear and uncertainty in the region,” he said.
The report mentioned that the Indian government’s claims about ‘legitimate response to terrorism’ could not be considered a proportionate response to the purported threat of terrorism and so constituted human rights violations. It described the measures of relentless interrogations, arbitrary tra­vel bans, administrative detention and repressive media policies and blocking access to human rights commission, preventing journalists and human rights defenders in occupied Jammu and Kashmir from communicating freely about the situation and denying them meaningful access to the region, as infringing on people’s rights to access to information.
The rights body monitored the human rights situation in occupied J&K for several years and found that the Indian government’s clampdown on dissent in the disputed territory had intensified since August 5, 2019.  
This intensification has had the impact of establishing increased control over the disputed region through a system of laws, policies and practices that systematically annihilate critical voices and violate the rights to freedom of expression and opinion of journalists and human rights defenders, the report stated.
Amnesty International spoke to representatives of civil society in occupied Jammu & Kashmir including journalists, lawyers, human rights defenders and a former judge. Amnesty International found unreasonable restrictions placed on freedom of movement and the right to political participation, as well as undue limitations on freedom of expression along with arbitrary arrest and illegal imprisonment of the people. Human rights defenders and journalists are at a higher risk of these violations in Jammu and Kashmir.
The passing of repressive policies such as the ‘2020 Revised Media Policy and 2021 Film Policy’ have been used as attempts to legitimise the censorship of expression and ensured a total control of information coming out of the region by the Indian government, it said.
Multiple news media outlets and human rights organisations consistently face raids and investigations from the National Investigation Agency and the Income Tax Department over politically motivated charges of financial irregularities. 
The harassment and intimidation have led to many journalists either losing or leaving their jobs. In addition, the sudden and forced closure of Kashmir Press Club in 2022 by the Indian government further silenced the culture of debate and solidarity amongst the journalists.
The report documented how since August 5, 2019, the Indian authorities had increased the use of travel bans, which are arbitrary executive actions not backed by any court order, warrant or even a written explanation, on journalists and human rights defenders violating their right to freedom of movement. At least six individuals including journalists, human rights activists and academics were stopped from travelling abroad without any reason, it said.

3,"Civil, military leadership resolve to fight floods","• Death toll climbs to 1,265 with 57 more casualties  • Damage assessment survey launched in Balochistan...","• Death toll climbs to 1,265 with 57 more casualties
• Damage assessment survey launched in Balochistan
ISLAMABAD: The Natio­nal Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) chief announced on Saturday that a survey had already been started to assess flood-related damages in Balochistan and similar studies would soon be conducted in other provinces, as the civil and military leadership expressed resolve to continue making a coordinated effort to rehabilitate flood-hit people.
The announcement came from NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Akhtar Nawaz during a press briefing with Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal and Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar after the first meeting of the recently formed National Flood Response Coordination Centre (NFRCC).
The NDMA chief disclosed that floods had damaged 5,563 kilometres of roads and 243 bridges, destroyed 1.4 million houses and affected 735,000 livestock.
The planning minister said that efforts being made by the provincial governments, armed forces, civil society and NGOs for carrying out rescue and relief operations were being integrated with the NFRCC.
Mr Iqbal urged citizens to donate through collection points set up by the armed forces all over the country as the DG ISPR provided details of the donations so far received and distributed among the flood-affected people.
“Our people’s trust is Pakistan Army’s biggest asset,” the DG ISPR declared while providing details of the relief work being carried out by the armed, air and naval forces across the country.
Pakistan is reeling from one of the worst floods in decades, with more than a third of the country submerged. Record monsoon rains and melting glaciers in northern mountains brought floods that have killed at least 1,265 people since June 14, with 57 casualties reported during the last 24 hours, according to the NDMA. 
Army relief camps
“We are utilising all our resources to rehabilitate people in the flood-affected areas,” the ISPR chief said while assuring the nation that Pakistan Army would stand with people in this difficult time.
Maj Gen Iftikhar specifically elaborated on the efforts being made by Army Chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, who had already visited flood-affected areas in all the four provinces.
“The leadership of the friendly countries are in contact with the army chief so that the flood-affected people can be helped,” he added.
He said the military had set up 284 “flood relief collection points” across the country to collect donations. Providing details, he said these points had already received 2,294 tonnes of ration, more than 311 tonnes of other necessary daily-use items and over 1.07m medicines.
Of them, 1,793 tonnes of ration, 277 tonnes of other daily-use items and 770,000 medicines had already been distributed, he said.
Besides, the Pakistan Air Force had rescued 1,521 people through 135 sorties in flood-hit areas, whereas more than 150 medical and relief camps had been set up to provide flood victims with free medical treatment and food, he said.
The DG ISPR said all general officers of the army had donated their one month’s salary to the flood relief account. Besides, in solidarity with flood victims, the army had decided to postpone its traditional Defence Day ceremony at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, he said. 
Highways, power feeders restored
Meanwhile, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the government had started rebuilding roads, highways and electric feeders washed away by floods.
“Two weeks back, 14 vital connectivity roads in Balochistan — on which the economy relies for its goods transport to and from other countries — were cut off,” he said, adding that “today, 11 of those have been restored”.
The minister said that out of the 81 grid stations damaged and submerged in water across the country, 69 had been restored. Similarly, 758 out of the 881 damaged feeders had been restored. Besides, out of the eight damaged power transmission lines, six have been fully restored.
“Around 3,500 telecommunication towers in Sindh and Balochistan were disrupted during floods […] All of these except 600 towers have been restored,” he said.
He said it would be impossible for the government or any other institution to deal with the situation alone, keeping in view the scale of the disaster.
“We need to get out of this difficult situation together. We need to start a new movement for the people who have lost their houses … It is also a lesson for us that we need to leave these rivers alone and let them flow freely,” he added while highlighting the issue of encroachments and building at the water courses.
Climate change effects
The NDMA chairman said Pakistan had seen the worst form of climate change this year which caused four heatwaves leading to forest fires in many parts of the country. He said there was no spring season this year in the country, which received monsoon rains nearly three months before time.
“According to the Met Office, 20 to 22 per cent above-normal rainfall was expected this year, but instead we saw over 190pc cumulative rain in Pakistan,” he said.
Talking about aid from the international community, he said Pakistan had received 29 relief flights so far and more were expected from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Turkmenistan and other countries in the next few days.
The aid includes fruit and dry fruit packages, high-powered boats from Turkiye, medicines and medical teams.
According to the state-run APP news agency, the first meeting of the NFRCC — set up recently to better articulate and synergise flood relief efforts across the country — was held in Islamabad under the chairmanship of Ahsan Iqbal on Saturday.
With representatives from federal and provincial governments and armed forces, the NFRCC would assess, plan, execute and coordinate various facets of the response to the current flood situation while synchronising internal and international elements of relief efforts, according to an official notification.
Besides, it would ensure the provision of requisite preparatory foresight in the long run for introducing required resilience in the national system and infrastructure against such future disasters.
The coordination centre would be headed by the prime minister as chairman, with the planning minister its deputy chairman, whereas the commander of the Army Air Defence Command will act as national coordinator.
Other members include the ministers of economic affairs, foreign affairs, interior, finance, climate change, communications, the minister of state for finance, the premier’s adviser on the establishment, and his coordinator on economy and energy, and the NDMA chairman.
The NFRCC’s secretariat will be housed at the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority’s headquarters and it will function under the national coordinator.
The centre’s terms of reference, or TORs, include interface with international and bilateral donors to ensure the availability of required relief and rehabilitation resources to enable national relief and rehabilitation effort; interface with international NGOs to help integrate their efforts with the overall national response; undertake required international and local procurements of relief items, etc.

4,Nine more PML-N MPAs get interim bail in Punjab Assembly ruckus case,Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan and Saiful Malook among the MPAs who secured bail.,"LAHORE: A sessions court on Saturday granted interim pre-arrest bail to nine members of Punjab Assembly belonging to PML-N in a case pertaining to violence in the assembly on the day of election of chief minister on April 16.
As the opposition MPAs — Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, Saiful Malook, Rukhsana Kausar, Mirza Javed, Khizar Khagha, Raja Sagheer Ahmad, Ghulam Habib Awan, Awais Leghari and Mian Rauf — appeared before the court to seek bail, their counsel Rana Asadullah Khan argued that police had implicated them in the case at the behest of the PTI-PML-Q coalition government in the province. In the same case, he added, the police had declared all MPAs of the ruling coalition innocent despite the availability of video evidence against them.
He asked the court to grant the bail to the petitioners. 
The court allowed the petitions for the interim bail till Sept 14 subject to furnishing of surety bonds.
Previously, prime minister’s special assistant Attaullah Tarar and MPA Bilal Farooq Tarar also secured pre-arrest bail from the courts in the case.
Qilla Gujjar Singh police had registered a case against the MPAs of PTI and PML-Q and staff of the assembly on charges of resorting to violence during the election of the chief minister, wherein Hamza Sheh­baz emerged victorious against Par­vez Elahi. The MPAs were also charged with manhandling the then deputy speaker Dost Mohammad Maz­ari. Several PTI and PML-Q lawmakers besides staff of the assembly, including then secretary Mohammad Khan Bhatti, had secured pre-arrest bail from court in the case. However, after Mr Elahi’s victory in a run-off election for the chief minister, police allegedly changed direction of investigation and started summoning PML-N lawmakers. Police also got warrants from a judicial magistrate for their arrest.

5,Imran asks lawyers to join his movement for rule of law,"Warns govt against ‘excesses’, says it will have nowhere to hide if he announced march on Islamabad...","BAHAWALPUR / DERA GHAZI KHAN: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Saturday urged the legal fraternity to become part of his “crusade” to revolutionise the justice system in the country as he separately warned the government to stop using “pressure tactics” against him as his patience was running thin.
The former prime minister made these remarks during his visit to Bahawalpur where he spoke at a ceremony organised by the lawyer community followed by a public gathering at Dring Stadium in the southern Punjab city.
At the rally, the PTI chief continued his tirade against the ruling parties and accused their leadership of corruption and economic mismanagement. Mr Khan warned the government that he had been tolerating “excesses” against his party for four months and said if he announced a march on Islamabad then the government would have nowhere to hide.
The former premier said there was still time to “save the country” by holding transparent general elections. Mr Khan said he would have another telethon next Sunday to collect funds for the flood survivors. He said accountability and a fair justice system would attract investments from overseas Pakistanis as well and end the country’s reliance on global money lenders.

Warns govt against ‘excesses’, says it will have nowhere to hide if he announced march on Islamabad

Addressing the gathering of lawyers, Mr Khan told them that he had come to the city to prepare them for ‘jihad’ to ensure the rule of law and added that “if you don’t understand what kind of jihad you’re fighting then you’ll carry out a suicide attack”.
Mr Khan bashed the Sharif family and PPP chief Asif Ali Zardari for their alleged role in laundering money out of Pakistan and called upon lawyers to launch a “collective struggle” against the “mafias” to bring “justice revolution” in Pakistan.
Visit to flood-hit areas
The former premier also visited flood-hit areas in Rajanpur, where he was given a detailed briefing by Dera Ghazi Khan Commissioner Liaqat Ali Chattha. He also met the flood victims in Rojhan Mazari and assured them that he would ask the Punjab government to compensate them for their losses. 
He said Murunj and Sorra dams should be built in the region to store floodwater and irrigate farmlands. The funds collected by the PTI during its donation drive would be spent on all survivors without any discrimination, he said.
Earlier in the day, in a tweet about his telethon to raise funds for the survivors, the PTI chairman claimed that Rs2.3 billion have been collected in response to his flood relief telethon. “I want to thank Pakistanis at home & overseas for donating Rs2.3bn already in response to my flood relief telethon. All those who are yet to deposit their pledges please do so. My team is working to facilitate overseas Pak who await 501 3(c) exemption for large transactions,” Imran Khan revealed.
In a separate development, PTI leader Kanwal Shauzab urged the United Arab Emirates and local authorities to take action after she was approached by “Dubai-based blackmailers” who threatened to leak her “video” if she failed to send them money.
