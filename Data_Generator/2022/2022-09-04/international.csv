0,Pressure mounts on govt to arrest Rajapaksa,COLOMBO: Deposed Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa faced calls for his arrest on Saturday after returning home...,"COLOMBO: Deposed Sri Lankan president Gotabaya Rajapaksa faced calls for his arrest on Saturday after returning home from self-imposed exile under the protection of his successor’s government.
Rajapaksa fled the island nation under military escort in July after a huge crowd stormed his official residence following months of demonstrations sparked by an unprecedented economic crisis.
The 73-year-old announced his resignation from Singapore and spent weeks under virtual house arrest at a Bangkok hotel before his return late on Friday.
Leaders of the protest campaign that toppled his government said Rajapaksa, who lost his presidential immunity after leaving office, should now be brought to justice.
“Gotabaya returned because no country is willing to accept him, he has no place to hide,” Joseph Stalin, the leader of a teachers’ trade union that helped mobilise demonstrators, told AFP.
“He should be arrested immediately for causing such misery for the 22 million people of Sri Lan­ka,” he added. “He can’t live freely as if nothing has happened.”
Rajapaksa’s government was accused of chaotic mismanagement as the Sri Lankan economy spiralled into a blistering downturn.
The crisis saw acute shortages of food, lengthy blackouts and long queues at gas stations for scarce fuel supplies after the country ran out of foreign currency to pay for vital imports.
Sri Lanka’s main opposition alliance, the Samagi Jana Balawe­gaya (SJB), has yet to comment on Rajapaksa’s return, but a former minister from the bloc said the ousted leader needed to be prosecuted. “Gotabaya must be held to account for his crimes before and during his presidency,” Ajith Perera told reporters in Colombo.
Rajapaksa was garlanded with flowers by ministers and senior politicians after disembarking from his flight in Colombo. He was driven in a security convoy to a new official residence in the capital provided to him by the government of President Ranil Wickremesinghe, his successor.
Wickremesinghe depends on Rajapaksa’s Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party to govern and on Friday passed an austerity budget — a precondition for an International Monetary Fund bailout — with the grouping’s support.
“Gotabaya’s return demonstrates that the SLPP is still powerful despite the humiliation they suffered,” Hasith Kandau­dahewa, a senior lecturer on international relations at the University of Colombo, told AFP.
Rajapaksa began receiving guests at his new home on Saturday with his elder brother — former president Mahinda Rajapaksa — one of the first to call on him, witnesses said.
Mahinda was serving as premier in his brother’s administration when he too was chased from his home by a mob who were responding to an attack on protesters by government loyalists.
Asia Society Policy Institute director Akhil Bery said the powerful family, which has dominated Sri Lankan politics for much of the past two decades, could be plotting a comeback.
Their allies “might be betting that the unpopular decisions Ranil has had to take will lay the groundwork for the Rajapaksas’ return”, the analyst told AFP.
Wickremesinghe’s government has drastically increased the cost of fuel and electricity to help repair the nation’s finances at a time when household budgets are under pressure from runaway inflation.

1,US angers China with $1.1bn arms sale to Taiwan,"The sale includes Side­winder missiles, which can be used for air-to-air and surface-attack missions, at a cost of some $85.6m.","WASHINGTON: The US State Department has appr­oved a potential $1.1 billion sale of military equipment to Taiwan, including 60 anti-ship missiles and 100 air-to-air missiles, with China threatening to take counter measures.
The Pentagon announced the package on Friday in the wake of China’s aggressive military drills around Taiwan following a visit to the island last month by US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the highest-ranking US official to travel to Taipei in years.
The sale includes Side­winder missiles, which can be used for air-to-air and surface-attack missions, at a cost of some $85.6 million, Har­poon anti-ship missiles at an estimated $355 million cost and support for Taiwan’s surveillance radar programme for an estimated $665.4 million, the Pentagon’s Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said.
Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement the possible arms sale  “severely jeopardises Chin­a-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.”   “China will resolutely take legitimate and necessary counter-measures in light of the development of the situation,” he said.
President Joe Biden’s adm­i­n­istration said the package has been under consideration for some time and was developed in consultation with Taiwan and US lawmakers.
“As the PRC continues to increase pressure on Taiwan including through heightened military air and maritime presence around Tai­wan and engages in attempts to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, were providing Taiwan with what it needs to maintain its self-defense capabilities,” Laura Rosenberger, White House senior director for China and Taiwan, said in a statement.
The Biden administration was planning new equipment for Taiwan but that the equipment would sustain Taiwan’s current military systems and fulfill existing orders, not offer new capabilities, despite the heightened tensions that followed Pelosi’s visit.

2,"Russians bid farewell to Gorbachev, but without Putin","Last leader of the Soviet Union buried next to his wife Raisa, who died from cancer in 1999.","MOSCOW: Russians on Saturday paid their final respects to the last leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, in a ceremony held in Moscow without much fanfare and with President Vladimir Putin notably absent.
Several thousand mourners queued up to quietly file past Gorbachev’s open casket as it was flanked by honour guards under the Russian flag in the historic Hall of Columns.
The hall has long been used for the funerals of high officials in Russia and was where the body of Joseph Stalin first lay in state during four days of national mourning after his death in 1953.
After several hours the coffin was taken out of the hall in a procession led by Dmitry Muratov, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning editor-in-chief of independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which Gorbachev helped found.
The coffin was taken to Moscow’s prestigious Novodevichy Cemetery, where it was lowered into the grave to the sounds of a military band playing the Russian national anthem and a gun salute. Gorbachev was buried next to his wife Raisa, who died from cancer in 1999.
With Russia facing increasing international isolation over its military action in Ukraine, many of those in attendance at the hall pointed to Gorbachev’s opening of the country to the rest of the world.
“It was a breath of freedom, which was lacking for a long time, an absence of fear,” 41-year-old translator Ksenia Zhupanova said at the entrance to the hall.
“I am against shutting us out from the outside world, I am for openness, for dialogue. This is what Mikhail Sergeyevich showed the world,” she said, using Gorbachev’s patronymic.
The mourners were of all ages, some old enough to remember the years of Soviet stagnation before Gorbachev came to power, others young enough to have only lived in Russia under Putin. The Kremlin had said Putin would not attend Saturday’s funeral due to his  “work schedule”.
Gorbachev died on Tuesday at the age of 91 following a  “serious and long illness”, the hospital where he was treated said.
In power between 1985 and 1991, he sought to transform the Soviet Union with democratic reforms, but eventually triggered its demise.
One of the great political figures of the 20th century, he was lionised in the West for helping to end the Cold War and trying to change the USSR. But many in Russia despised him for the economic chaos and loss of global influence that followed the Soviet collapse.
He had spent most of the last few decades out of the political limelight and his death this week was barely acknowledged in official circles in Russia.
State television on Thursday showed images of Putin, alone, laying a bouquet of red roses near Gorbachev’s open casket at the hospital where he died.
Putin had a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Saturday, the Kremlin said, during which the two discussed Ukraine and Erdogan passed on his condolences for Gorbachev’s death. The only senior foreign figure to attend was Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who laid flowers at the casket.
“Many things were needed for Central Europe to get rid of Communism peacefully, without loss of life or bloodshed. One of them was Mikhail Gorbachev. God rest his soul!” Orban said in a post on Facebook.

3,Small-plane pilot held after threat to crash into store,WASHINGTON: A pilot who had threatened to crash his small plane into a Walmart store in Mississippi has landed and...,"WASHINGTON: A pilot who had threatened to crash his small plane into a Walmart store in Mississippi has landed and been taken into custody, officials said.
The plane, which had circled erratically over the city of Tupelo and a nearby area for hours, landed around 11:25am Eastern time (1525 GMT), Connie Strickland, a dispatcher with the Benton County sheriff’s office, said.
Benton County is about 40 miles (65 kilometres) northwest of Tupelo. The authorities have not identified the pilot or released any information on possible motive.
Some six hours earlier, the pilot had called a 911 emergency operator in Tupelo,  “threatening to intentionally crash into Walmart on West Main,” according to a statement from the city’s police department.
The sprawling department store and a neighbouring gas station were evacuated, and people were warned to stay away. The plane later appeared to leave the Tupelo area and fly to the northwest, according to the FlightAware tracking website.
Tupelo police initially warned people to stay away from the area around the Walmart store but cautioned that  “with the mobility of an airplane of that type, the danger zone is much larger.” The aircraft appeared to be a King Air utility plane built by Beechcraft, with seating for seven to 11 passengers.

4,"New York polio case stirs fear, vaccine push",Infected man was a member of the Orthodox Jewish community where vaccine hesitancy tends to run high.,"POMONA: When Brittany Strickland heard that the United States recorded its first polio case in almost a decade, she was ‘deathly scared’ — the 33-year-old wasn’t vaccinated against the disabling disease.
“My mom was an anti-vaxxer, so I found out that I had never had any polio vaccines as a child,” the designer explained to AFP, after finally receiving a shot this week.
“It’s horrifying,” said Strickland. “You don’t think it’s gonna happen here, and then a bunch of people don’t get vaccinated and now we’re in this situation.” 
Strickland was inoculated in Pomona, in New York’s Rockland County where the first US polio case since 2013 was identified in July in a young man who was not inoculated and the disease was causing him paralysis. 

Infected man was a member of the Orthodox Jewish community where vaccine hesitancy tends to run high

Officials said he had not travelled abroad, suggesting the disease had transmitted locally. 
Local news reports say the infected man was a member of the Orthodox Jewish community, where vaccine hesitancy tends to run high. Rockland is home to a large population of Orthodox Jews. Last week, more than a dozen rabbis published an open letter urging members to get vaccinated.
Shoshana Bernstein, an independent health communicator and Orthodox Jew who is educating members on the importance of getting immunized, says “any community that’s more insular” is susceptible to anti-vax messaging. However, she says, they do have elders in the community who can talk from first-hand experience.
While it is too early to say whether the solitary case is part of a limited or more widespread outbreak, John Dennehy, a virologist at the City University of New York, fears it could just be “the tip of the iceberg”. “Only a proportion of the people who are infected will ever show any symptoms, and only a fraction of those people will ever get paralytic polio,” he says.
“But if enough people are getting infected, eventually we start seeing more and more paralytic polio.”
Since July, the disease has been detected in wastewater samples in the area, as well as in a neighbouring county and in New York City sewage, suggesting the virus is spreading. The developments are leading experts to fear that polio, once one of the most feared diseases in America but now endemic to just a couple of developing countries, may wreak devastation stateside again.
“I had considered it a virus that was on its way to extinction,” said Dennehy.
Health officials are urging anyone not immunized to get vaccinated, with Rockland County offering free shots.
The area, 48 kilometres north of Manhattan, has a polio vaccination rate well below the national average. Sixty per cent of two-year-olds have received a vaccine, compared to 79 per cent state-wide, New York’s health department says. Nationally, the figure is 92pc, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommends people receive the first of four doses at two months old.

5,Nasa postpones rocket launch to Moon after fuel leak,A leak near the base of the rocket was found as ultra-cold liquid hydrogen was being pumped in.,"

CAPE CANAVERAL (Florida, US): Nasa’s Artemis I rocket sits on launch pad at Kennedy Space Centre on Saturday.—AFP

 
KENNEDY CENTER: Nasa on Saturday scrapped a second attempt to get its new 30-story rocket off the ground and send its uncrewed test capsule towards the Moon after engineers detected a fuel leak.
With millions around the globe and hundreds of thousands on nearby beaches waiting for the historic launch of the massive Space Launch System (SLS), a leak near the base of the rocket was found as ultra-cold liquid hydrogen was being pumped in.
“The launch director waived off today’s Artemis I launch,” Nasa said in a statement.  “Multiple troubleshooting efforts to address the area of the leak did not fix the issue.” Though the area around the launch site was closed to the public, an estimated 400,000 people had gathered nearby to see — and hear — the most powerful vehicle that Nasa has ever launched climb into space.
The initial launch attempt on Monday was also halted after engineers detected a fuel leak and a sensor showed that one of the rocket’s four main engines was too hot.
Early on Saturday, launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson had given the go-ahead to start filling the rocket’s tanks with cryogenic fuel.
About three million liters of ultra-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen were due to be pumped into the spacecraft, but the process soon hit problems. No new date for another try was immediately announced.
After the latest delay, there are backup opportunities on Monday or Tuesday. After that, the next launch window will not be until Sept 19, due to the Moon’s position.
The purpose of the Artemis 1 mission is to verify that the Orion capsule, which sits atop the SLS rocket, is safe to carry astronauts in the future. Mannequins equipped with sensors are standing in for astronauts on the mission and will record acceleration, vibration and radiation levels.

6,Nine migrants drown in  Mexico border crossing attempt,Recent migrant deaths have highlighted dangerous journey hundreds of thousands take each year trying to reach US...,"WASHINGTON: At least nine migrants drowned and dozens of others were rescued after attempting to cross the Rio Grande river from Mexico into the United States, officials said on Saturday.
US Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) said in a statement that the drownings occurred on Thursday, when a large group attempted to cross the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, Texas.
Thirty-seven people were rescued but the bodies of nine migrants were found — three by Mexico authorities and six by US agents.

Recent migrant deaths have highlighted dangerous journey hundreds of thousands take each year trying to reach US

A total of 53 migrants were detained on the US side and Mexican officials on their side of the river picked up 39, CBP said in a statement. 
No information was provi­ded about the ages or nationalities of the migrants. “The search continues for other possible victims,” CBP added.
A CBP official told the Washington Post that the mass drowning appeared to be the worst in years along the Rio Grande.
Eagle Pass lies within the CBP’s Del Rio region, where nearly 50,000 migrants were arrested last month, according to government data.
The city’s fire chief, Manuel Mello, told the New York Times that the migrants had been swept away by strong currents about a mile south of the International Bridge that links Eagle Pass with Piedras Negras, Mexico. Mello noted that drownings had become frequent in the area, with as many as one per day.
Recent mass migrant deaths have highlighted the dangerous journey hundreds of thousands take each year trying to reach the United States from Mexico.
In June, over 50 people died after being abandoned in a scorching hot trailer in San Antonio, Texas.

7,Militants kill 19 Somali civilians,MOGADISHU: Fighters from the Islamist insurgent group Al Shabaab have killed at least 19 civilians in a night-time...,"MOGADISHU: Fighters from the Islamist insurgent group Al Shabaab have killed at least 19 civilians in a night-time attack in central Somalia, clan chiefs and local officials said on Saturday.
The attack comes two weeks after Al Shabaab, which has waged a long insurgency against the Somali state, besieged a hotel in the capital Mogadishu for 30 hours, leaving 21 people dead and 117 injured.
The sources said at least eight vehicles were travelling on a road between the towns of Beledweyne and Maxaas when the insurgents intercepted and burned them and killed the passengers overnight Friday to Saturday by Afar-Irdood village.
“The terrorists massacred innocent civilians who were travelling... last night. We don’t have the exact number of victims, but 19 dead bodies have been collected,” local clan elder Abdulahi Hared said.
“The dead bodies are still being collected, including women and children.
They could be more than 20,” said Ali Jeyte, the governor of the Hiiraan region where the attack happened.
“This was a horrible attack that has never happened in our region. These were innocent civilians who did nothing to deserve this,” added another local clan leader, Mohamed Abdirahman.
Al Shabaab in a statement said they targeted fighters from a local sub-clan that recently helped government forces and that they killed 20  “militiamen and those who were transporting material for them”, destroying nine of their vehicles.
Local fighters and the security forces recaptured several villages from Al Shabaab in the region in late August.
Ali Gudlawe, president of Hirshabelle state where the attack took place, released a statement offering condolences to the victims’ loved ones and promising to continue  “operations to cleanse” the region of Al Shabaab.
“The only way we have is to be united to fight and liberate our country from them. I call upon the society not to be discouraged,” said his counterpart in Jubaland state, Ahmed Madobe.
The Al Qaeda-linked group has been fighting Somalia’s internationally backed federal government since 2007.
It has been driven out of the country’s main cities, including Mogadishu in 2011, but remains a serious security threat in large areas of the countryside.
Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, elected in May after a protracted political crisis, promised to wage  “an all-out war” to eliminate Al Shabaab following the Mogadishu hotel attack.
The bloody siege drew international condemnation from partners including the United States, Britain, Turkey and the United Nations.
After Mohamud’s election, President Joe Biden said he would restore a US military presence in Somalia to fight Al Shabaab.
The Pentagon had recommended the move, considering the rotation system of Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump as too risky and ineffective.

8,"Russia keeps pipeline shut as Gazprom, Siemens Energy wrangle","BERLIN: Russia kept one of its main gas supply routes to Europe shut on Saturday, stoking fears of winter fuel...","BERLIN: Russia kept one of its main gas supply routes to Europe shut on Saturday, stoking fears of winter fuel shortages and spotlighting differences between Gazprom and Germany’s Siemens Energy over repair work on the pipeline.
Already struggling to tame soaring gas prices, European governments had expected the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to resume flows after a short maintenance this week but Russia abruptly cancelled the restart, citing an oil leak in a turbine.
Europe has accused Russia of weaponising energy supplies in what Moscow has called an  “economic war” with the West over the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Moscow blames Western sanctions and technical issues for supply disruptions.
The latest Nord Stream shutdown, which Russia says will last for as long as it takes to carry out repairs, added to fears of winter gas shortages that could help tip major economies into recession and energy rationing.
The discovery of the oil leak on Friday coincided with the Group of Seven (G7) wealthy democracies proceeding with plans to impose a price gap on Russian oil, intending to shrink President Vladimir Putin’s resources to fight the war in Ukraine.
Gas shortages also prompted European Union member Sweden on Saturday to unveil a financial support package for energy firms.
“If we do not act, there is a serious risk of disruptions in the financial system, which in the worst case could lead to a financial crisis,” said Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson. “Putin wants to create division, but our message is clear: you will not succeed,” she said.
Gazprom said Siemens Energy was ready to carry out repairs on the pipeline but that there was nowhere available to carry out the work, a suggestion Siemens Energy denied, saying it had not been asked to do the job. Siemens Energy has also said that sanctions do not prohibit maintenance.
Before the latest round of maintenance, Gazprom had already cut flows to just 20pc of the pipeline’s capacity.
“Siemens is taking part in repair work in accordance with the current contract, is detecting malfunctions ... and is ready to fix the oil leaks. Only there is nowhere to do the repair,” Gazprom said in a statement on its Telegram channel on Saturday.
Siemens Energy said it had not been commissioned to carry out the work but was available, adding that the Gazprom-reported leak would not usually affect the operation of a turbine and could be sealed on site.
“Irrespective of this, we have already pointed out several times that there are enough additional turbines available in the Portovaya compressor station for Nord Stream 1 to operate,” a spokesperson for the company said.
Flows through Nord Stream 1 were due to resume early on Saturday morning. But hours before it was set to start pumping gas, Gazprom published a photo on Friday of what it said was an oil leak on a piece of equipment.
Siemens Energy, which supplies and maintains equipment at Nord Stream 1’s Portovaya compressor station said on Friday the leak did not constitute a technical reason to stop gas flows.
“Global natural gas prices will likely rally hard on Monday as markets readjust to this latest #Gazprom development,” Tom Marzec-Manser, Head of Gas Analytics at ICIS, said on twitter.
“The closure of #NordStream1 reduces overall Russian pipeline flows yet further and will make balancing supply & demand this winter all the more difficult.”  Asked about the halt on Saturday, Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said that the European Union expects Russia to respect its agreed energy contracts but is prepared to meet the challenge if Moscow fails to do so.
The German network regulator said that the country’s gas supply was currently guaranteed but the situation was fragile and further deterioration could not be ruled out.
“The defects alleged by the Russian side are not a technical reason for the halt of operations,” it said.
Wholesale gas prices have rocketed more than 400pc since August 2021, squeezing households already gripped by a cost-of-living crisis and forcing some energy hungry industries, such as fertiliser and aluminium makers, to scale back production.
The European Commission has said a full cut-off of Russian gas supplies to Europe, if combined with a cold winter, could reduce average EU gross domestic product by up to 1.5pc if countries did not prepare in advance.

9,UN envoy meets leaders of Polisario Front in Algeria,"ALGIERS: The UN’s Western Sahara envoy, Staffan de Mistura, met on Saturday with representatives of the Polisario...","ALGIERS: The UN’s Western Sahara envoy, Staffan de Mistura, met on Saturday with representatives of the Polisario independence movement in Algeria as part of a regional tour, Sahrawi sources said.
The Algerian-backed Polisario Front wants an independent state in the Western Sahara, a vast stretch of mineral-rich desert which Morocco sees as a sovereign part of its own territory.
De Mistura met at a Sahrawi refugee camp with Khatri Addouh, the Polisario’s chief negotiator, and Omar Sidi Mohamed, the group’s permanent representative to the United Nations.
The camp is located in Tindouf, where the Polisario Front is based in far southwestern Algeria near the borders with Morocco and Western Sahara.
Announcing the visit on Friday, a UN spokeswoman said de Mistura was  “looking forward to deepening consultations with all parties concerned on the prospect of constructively advancing the political process in Western Sahara”.
The Italian-Swedish diplomat also met a group of Sahrawi youth and women, according to the Sahrawi news agency SPS. 
On Sunday, he is scheduled to hold talks with Polisario leader Brahim Ghali, the movement’s UN representative said.
De Mistura was appointed in November and undertook his first mission in July, travelling to Rabat to meet Moroccan officials before delaying a planned trip to Western Sahara.
A former Spanish colony, Western Sahara sits on the western edge of the vast eponymous desert, stretching along the Atlantic coast. 
When Spain withdrew in 1975, Morocco sent thousands of people across the border and claimed it was an integral part of its territory.
The following year the Polisario Front declared a Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic (SADR), with support from Algeria and Libya, and demanded a referendum on self-determination. Since then 84 UN member states have recognised the SADR.
But a stalemate ensued, and Morocco built razor-wire-topped concentric sand walls in the desert that still ring 80 percent of the territory that it controls.
Under a 1991 ceasefire, the UN, which considers the Western Sahara  “a non-self-governing territory”, deployed a peacekeeping mission.
The international community has long backed a referendum to be held to decide the territory’s status. But Morocco rejects any vote in which independence is an option, arguing that only granting autonomy is on the table for the sake of regional security.

10,Thousands rally against Czech govt in Prague,"PRAGUE: Around 70,000 people gathered in Prague’s historic centre on Saturday to rally against the Czech...","PRAGUE: Around 70,000 people gathered in Prague’s historic centre on Saturday to rally against the Czech government, accusing it of paying more attention to war-ravaged Ukraine than to its own citizens.
Called  “Czech Republic in the first place”, the protest highlighted growing inflation dragged upwards by a spike in energy prices, Covid-19 vaccination as well as immigrants.
Protesters in Prague’s iconic Wenceslas Square demanded the resignation of the centre-right government of Petr Fiala, which had taken office last December.
“The best for Ukrainians and two sweaters for us,” read a banner, a reference to concerns over winter heating bills.
Energy prices are growing across Europe following a drop in gas supplies from Russia, which has also seen electricity prices rise.
“The rally in Wenceslas Square is quiet, we didn’t have to deal with any serious problems. We estimate the number of participants at about 70,000 as of 1230 GMT,” Czech police said on Twitter.
The Czech Republic, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, has received around 400,000 refugees from Ukraine since it was invaded by Russia on February 24 and provided substantial military and humanitarian aid to the war-torn country.
Fiala’s government survived a no-confidence vote in parliament on Friday, initiated by two opposition parties — the centrist populist ANO of former billionaire prime minister Andrej Babis and the far-right SPD movement.
Fiala told reporters the rally was organised by  “pro-Russian people who are close to extremist positions and whose interests run counter to the interests of the Czech Republic”.
“It is clear that Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns are present on our territory and some people simply listen to them,” he added.

11,Former Kyrgyzstan president named UN envoy to Afghanistan,Otunbayeva became interim president of Kyrgyzstan in April 2010 after a bloody uprising forced then-leader Bakiyev into exile.,"UNITED NATIONS: United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has named former Kyrgyzstan president Roza Otunbayeva as the UN’s new special representative for Afghanistan, his office said.
Otunbayeva became interim president of Kyrgyzstan in April 2010 after a bloody uprising forced then-leader Kurmanbek Bakiyev into exile. She relinquished power the following year after new elections were organised.
A former parliamentarian and government minister, she was also a deputy special representative of the former UN mission to Georgia. She is currently a member of a high-level UN council dealing with the mediation and prevention of conflicts.
She is replacing another woman, Canadian Deborah Lyons, as head of the UN mission in Afghanistan, where the rights of women and girls have been drastically curtailed since the Taliban’s return to power last year.
Separately, Guterres appointed Senegalese diplomat Abdoulaye Bathily as the UN’s envoy to Libya following a recent outbreak of fighting between rival governments.
The former Senegalese minister was previously the UN’s representative in Central Africa, special adviser to the secretary-general for Madagascar and deputy special representative for the UN mission in Mali.
The UN’s efforts to hold peace talks and pave the way for elections has come under renewed pressure after violence shook Tripoli in late July.

12,Qatar to allow beer sales at World Cup games three hours before kickoff,Budweiser will serve beer within the ticketed perimeter surrounding each stadium.,"DOHA: Qatar will permit ticketed fans to buy alcoholic beer at World Cup soccer matches starting three hours before kickoff and for one hour after the final whistle, but not during the match, a source with knowledge of plans for the tournament said.
Budweiser, a major World Cup sponsor with exclusive rights to sell beer at the tournament, will serve beer within the ticketed perimeter surrounding each stadium, but not in the stadium stands or concourse, the source said.
This year’s World Cup is the first to be held in a Muslim country with strict controls on alcohol, presenting unique challenges for organisers of an event sponsored by a major beer brand and often associated with beer-drinking fans.  “Beer will be available when gates open, which is three hours before kick off. Whoever wants to have a beer will be able to. And then when they leave the stadium as well for one hour after the final whistle,” the source said.
Additionally, Budweiser will be permitted to serve beer in part of the main FIFA fan zone in central Doha from 6:30pm to 1:00am every day of the 29-day tournament, which kicks off on Nov 20, the source said.
At previous World Cup tournaments, beer was served in fan zones all day long.
The decision about where and when beer will be sold to fans is now finalised, but the price fans will be charged for a beer is still under discussion, the source said.
“We are working closely with FIFA, which is managing the relationship with the Qatari authorities, to ensure our activations for the tournament are executed respectfully and in compliance with local rules and regulations,” a spokesperson for Budweiser brewer AB InBev said in an emailed statement.
Qatar’s World Cup organisers, the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, did not respond to requests for comment about the World Cup controls on alcohol. Qatar’s government media office directed requests to the Supreme Committee.
There are four matches scheduled on most days of the tournament’s group stage, with the earliest match kicking off at 1pm.
It was not immediately clear how Qatar will handle beer sales ahead of the 1pm Wales and Iran game on Friday Nov 25, when most Muslims in Qatar will be gathering at mosques for the weekly congregational prayer.
Qatar currently requires most shops and restaurants in the country to close during Friday prayers.
Questions have swirled around the role alcohol would play at this year’s World Cup since Qatar won hosting rights in 2010. While not a  “dry” state like neighbouring Saudi Arabia, consuming alcohol in public places is illegal in Qatar.
Visitors cannot bring alcohol into Qatar, even from airport duty free, and they cannot buy alcohol at the country’s only liquor store, on the outskirts of Doha. Only foreign residents with permits can shop there for home consumption.
Visitors can drink at a few dozen licensed hotels and clubs, where a pint of beer can cost $18.
Budweiser will sell its non-alcoholic beer, Budweiser Zero, in stadium concourses and stands during games and at other fan sites, the source said.
“We always respect the local customs and culture in the markets in which we operate or host events,” a spokesperson for AB InBev said in an emailed statement.
“Our promotion and activation of Budweiser Zero during the FIFA World Cup in Qatar will target the international guests coming to enjoy and celebrate football at the fan sites.”

13,Al Qaeda in Yemen releases video of kidnapped UN worker,DUBAI: Al Qaeda’s Yemen branch released a video on Saturday showing a United Nations worker who was abducted in ...,"DUBAI: Al Qaeda’s Yemen branch released a video on Saturday showing a United Nations worker who was abducted in the war-torn country more than six months ago, the SITE Intelligence Group reported.
Five UN staff members were kidnapped in Yemen’s southern province of Abyan in February while returning to the port city of Aden  “after having completed a field mission,” UN spokesperson Eri Kaneko said at the time.
In Saturday’s video message, apparently recorded on August 9, Akam Sofyol Anam, identified by SITE as Bangladeshi, urges  “the UN, the international community, the humanitarian organisations, to please come forward... and meet the demands of my captors”, without outlining the demands.
He said he was facing  “serious health trouble”, including heart problems, and needed  “immediate medical support and hospitalisation”, according to SITE, which monitors extremist activity.
Anam, who SITE identified as the  “director of the United Nations Office of Security and Safety in Yemen”, said he and four colleagues were kidnapped on February 11.
Yemen has been gripped by conflict since the Iran-backed Houthi rebels took control of the capital Sanaa in 2014, triggering a Saudi-led military intervention in support of the beleaguered government the following year.
Hundreds of thousands have died, directly from fighting as well as indirectly, and millions have been displaced in what the UN has called the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
Aden became the base of Yemen’s internationally recognised government after the Houthis ousted it from the capital Sanaa in 2014. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and militants loyal to the militant Islamic State group have thrived in the chaos.
