1,Life term of ‘gangster’ set aside in policeman murder case,SHC rules benefit of doubt must go to accused ‘by way of right as opposed to concession’...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has set aside the life imprisonment handed down to an alleged gangster by an antiterrorism court in a case pertaining to the murder of a traffic police constable.
An ATC had sentenced Muhammad Jawed Akhtar, said to be linked with criminal gangs operating in Lyari, to life in prison in November 2020 for killing Constable Ehtisham Ahmed in January 2019 in Garden.
The convict, through his counsel, had approached the SHC and filed an appeal against his conviction and after hearing both sides and examining the record, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha allowed the appeal and overturned the conviction order of the trial court.
The bench in its judgement observed that the prosecution had to prove its case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and the benefit of the doubt must go to the accused party “by way of right as opposed to concession”.

SHC rules benefit of doubt must go to accused ‘by way of right as opposed to concession’

It pointed out that the entire case of prosecution was almost exclusively rested on the evidence of a sole eyewitness, who was a rickshaw driver, and as per the prosecution, he did see the appellant killing the constable along with his two accomplices on a motorcycle. The slain constable was also riding a two-wheeler, according to the eyewitness.
However, the bench questioned the presence of the eyewitness at the crime scene when the incident took place and stated that the same was doubtful.
It observed that the witness could not have been able to correctly and safely identify the appellant while there was hardly any cogent corroborative evidence to support his testimony.
The judgement further said that the eyewitness in the cross-examination before the trial court admitted that there was less light as the incident took place early in the morning.
About the identification parade of the appellant before the magistrate, the bench observed that his formal arrest in the particular case was made three weeks after his arrest in other cases and he was in police custody and could easily have been shown to the eyewitness before the line-up.
It said the appellant had also complained to the magistrate that his face was shown to the eyewitness prior to the identification parade.
It further said that police did not produce two co-accused persons before the magistrate for an identification parade without any explanation and later they were acquitted. It prima facie showed that police were acting in a mala fide manner towards the appellant, the verdict said.
“It is true that we can convict based on the evidence of a sole  eyewitness however based on the particular facts and circumstances of  this case as discussed above we find that even if the eyewitness was  present at the time of the incident, which we very much doubt, based on  the reasons mentioned above he would not have been able to correctly,  safely and reliably identify the appellant and as such we veer on the  side of caution in this case especially as there appears to be hardly  any cogent corroborative or supportive evidence and find that the  eyewitness was not able to correctly identify the appellant as the  person who shot and murdered the deceased,” the verdict said.
According to the prosecution, the  23-year-old Ehtisham Ahmed was riding from his home in the Garden area  to perform his duty at a traffic post near the mausoleum of Quaid-i-Azam  when the accused also riding a motorbike, opened fire on him from  behind on Nishtar Road near Abu Ubaida mosque at around 5:15am and rode  away. The victim had sustained three bullet wounds and died on the spot,  it added.

Ashok Kumar has been booked in a case pertaining to allegedly cheating the people who got booked expensive flats in his multi-story residential project in Clifton.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Naseer Noor Khan pronounced his order reserved earlier after hearing arguments on the application seeking confirmation or otherwise of the interim pre-arrest bail.
The judge recalled his previous order of granting the interim bail to the applicant on July 28 and dismissed his application. The builder escaped from the courtroom following the bail dismissal, as the investigating officer of the case was not present to arrest him, witnesses and lawyers told Dawn.
According to the complainants, the builder had launched an 18-storey residential project in Clifton in 2016, but had only constructed the ground floor contrary to his commitments to the customers and took money received from them in advance.
Three FIRs pertaining to alleged cheating have been lodged against him at the Clifton police station on the complaints of the customers.

“In the second phase, complete rehabilitation of the affected people will be started,” he added.  
Sharjeel said that some people had been shifted to government schools and relief camps set up in tent cities, adding that many families had opted to stay with their relatives in different cities, including Karachi.  
“Accurate figures could only be ascertained after the situation returns to normal,” he said.  
Responding to another question, he said that he did not want to discuss any politics at this time, but it was unfortunate that a political party holding public gatherings, processions and musical concerts at time when flood-affected people and children needed help.

6,Experts to draw strategy to cope with flood devastation in Dadu: minister,LARKANA: Sindh Min­ister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah has said that Manchhar Lake has filled to its...,"LARKANA: Sindh Min­ister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah has said that Manchhar Lake has filled to its maximum capacity and in the obtaining situation irrigation experts were asked to chalk out a strategy accordingly to tackle the situation. Addressing press conference at the local press club on Saturday, he admitted that amidst the large scale damage caused by the unprecedented rains, Sindh government alone was not in a position to cope with the situation. 
He said the chief of army staff and prime minister were currently visiting the affected areas in the country and taking aerial view of the affected areas to assess the devastation. He said the PM was likely to fly over Dadu and Qambar-Shahdadkot districts and Dadu districts on Sunday while Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari was also planning to have an aerial view of the rain-affected areas.
Accompanied by former home minister Sohail Anwar Siyal, political secretary to the PPP chairman Jamil Soomro, Nasir Shah said that floodwater gushing from Balochistan would finally flow into River Indus after crossing Manchhar Lake. Due to unexpected water volume, we could not guess at the moment that for how much time the water would stay in Manchhar Lake, the minister said. 
He said 23 districts of Sindh were affected by the rains whereas Qambar-Shahdadkot and certain other districts were badly devastated. He said over 10 million people were affected in Sindh whereas the agriculture sector was severely hit.  The minister apprehended cropping up of food scarcity issue in the days to come. If receding of water too more time than expected, this could cause another problem of cultivating wheat crop, as in standing water, crop could not be sown, he said. 
Keeping this in view, PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari had proposed fixing of official wheat procurement rate at Rs4,000/40kg instead of Rs3,000/40kg, he said. 
Referring to relief distribution work, the minister said that so far, 127,000 tents had been provided to marooned people in Sindh while the government had also placed an order for more tents. He stressed on establishing ‘tent cities’ to accommodate displaced people and appreciated NGOs for purring in their efforts in serving the affected population.

In reply to a question, he said floods posed no threat to Sukkur Barrage, Akil Aghani and certain other dykes, and advised people not to lend ear to rumours being spread through social media to create fear and apprehensions among people. “You are welcome to criticise government but you must have seen our people present in the field in this difficult time,” Mr Shah said. 
The Larkana administration was asked to clear stagnant water from the city areas within three days or face the music, he said. 
MPA Sohail Anwar Siyal linked the damage sustained by villages of Larkana to the heavy flooding in Qambar-Shahdadkot and Dadu districts. He said 56 people marooned in Qambar-Shahdadkot areas were rescued by army using helicopters. He appealed to philanthropists to come forward and put in their share in mitigating the miseries of the rain-affected people. He noted that currently high flood peak was passing through Sukkur Barrage, and hoped that floodwater would start receding within five days.

Sleuths of a foreign country tracked down the exact location of the car and informed customs authorities here, who also took into custody two persons from the DHA house and lodged an FIR.
The excise department was accused as a ‘facilitator’ in evading taxes amounting to over Rs300 million as the provincial government registered the luxury vehicle, whose assessed value at the time of import was shows as Rs41.43m, without permission of the foreign ministry and a no-objection certificate from the customs.  
According to the FIR lodged against the held suspects — Jameel Shafi, Naveed Bilawani and an unidentified facilitator of the Sindh Excise and Taxation Department and other persons — the Collectorate of the Customs Enforcement Office received a ‘credible’ information from the intelligence agency of a friendly country that a Bentley had been stolen from London and their intelligence agency indicated that the said vehicle was suspected to be parked in a house (15-B, South, 10th Street) in DHA, Karachi.  

‘Owner’ failed to produce legal papers of luxury car tracked down by foreign authorities

Accordingly, the customs officials carried out surveillance and after fulfilling legal formalities visited the house along with a lady officer and identified the vehicle parked there.  
The officials asked the ‘owner’, Jameel Shafi, to provide legal documents of the vehicle upon which he, instead of producing legal documents, gave the statement that the said vehicle had been sold to him by a person named Naveed Bilwani with terms of agreement that Mr Bilwani would bear all liabilities to clear required documentation from the concerned authorities till November 2022.  
“As his statement was not satisfactory and he could not produce the document of the said vehicle therefore, the vehicle was taken into possession accordingly,” according to the FIR.  
In the meantime, Naveed Bilwani also appeared there.  
On being asked to furnish the legal documents of the vehicle, Bilwani showed his ‘inability’ to provide requisite documents and was not able to give ‘satisfactory reply’.  
“…No legal documents were provided by both the accused persons showing legal ownership except the vehicle sale agreement given by Jameel Shafi which was not sufficient.” 
Later on, during the preliminary investigation, Bilwani informed the customs that he had only helped brokering a deal between Shafi and another person namely Naveed Yamin as a guarantor of payment and papers and Mr Yamin received cash and pay orders from Shafi as payment against the vehicle.  
“The said vehicle was checked from Motor Registration Excise and Taxation Department, govt. of Sindh, website which showed that the vehicle is already registered with Motor Registration Excise and Taxation Department, which is against the law as in the said case, sale permission from Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NOC from Pakistan Customs as well as payment of duty and taxes are required,” the FIR stated.  
“This suspicious registration of the vehicle indicates connivance of staff of Motor Registration Excise and Taxation Department,” the FIR said. 
Therefore, the both the said persons were taken into custody.  
The customs department nominated Naveed Yamin and an unknown official of the excise department in the said case registered under relevant laws of the Customs Act of 1969.  
The customs officials believed that the said persons ‘illegally’ possessed and dealt in the said vehicle by evading the amount of duty and taxes to the tune of Rs307,427,997.

11,Land of armed forces be used to provide shelter to flood victims: JI,Hafiz Naeem says his party can set up tent city for displaced persons...,"KARACHI: While praising the armed forces for their recent rescue and relief operations in the flood-hit areas across Pakistan, the Jamaat-i-Islami on Saturday “appealed” to the army chief to go a step forward and give shelter to hundreds of thousands of homeless people and affectees on the land owned by the armed forces.
The party, which has been actively involved in rescue and rehabilitation operations in the flood-hit areas under its welfare wing, Al-Khidmat, came up with the suggestion for immediate relief of the displaced persons, calling it a most viable proposal after the provincial government and its institutions have “failed to handle the situation”.
“We sincerely appreciate the efforts of our armed forces,” the party’s Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman told a press here. “They have proved their excellence in the post-disaster situation. Whether, it’s the army, navy or air force...they all are contributing to contain the impact of this natural calamity.”
He continued: “But let me make a request here. I want to make an appeal to the army chief for a step forward. I request you to please give these homeless people shelter on the lands owned by the armed forces. We can set up a tent city there.”

Hafiz Naeem says his party can set up tent city for displaced persons

He said Al-Khidmat was spending millions of rupees every day with the cooperation of the people of Karachi through its thousands of volunteers, who were in the flood-hit areas for the last two weeks. But, the level of challenge could not be met by any welfare body, he said.
“No relief body can singlehandedly meet this challenge. It’s the job of the state. It’s the job of the government, its ministers, its local government system and bureaucracy. Because they have the resources, power and funds,” he said. “But, unfortunately here in Sindh and other flood-hit provinces we don’t see any government on ground. The system has failed miserably. So I request you [armed forced] to play your role.”
Referring to the lands and residential facilities owned by the armed forces in Karachi, Hyderabad and Pannu Aqil and other parts of the country, he said that these could be used for providing temporary shelters to the hundreds of thousands of homeless people.

S M Raza is one of them. His latest exhibition of artworks titled An Ode to Silence at the Art Chowk Gallery is another evidence of his continuing development as a painter. To boot, the subject that he has chosen this time around, silence, gives away the sensitivity that he carries within.
The exhibits that Raza has put on display are to do with the artist’s past. 
He says, “The new body of work is partially inspired by my teenage years’ memories of our old house and surroundings, the days when I had all the time in the world and no worries at all. After returning from school every day I used to sit in my backyard where we had a big jujube tree listening to birds chirping, taking care of chickens and pigeons. I didn’t have much to do at that time so my duty was to feed them and build their houses using wooden planks and bricks. On sunny days I observed shadows. 
“Once the sun was down I would go out for a walk with a friend… Observing the sky changing its colours from orange to purple to deep blue and finally black. Sometimes the moon would appear in the dark and other day’s clouds floating like cotton balls in the dark sky,” he adds.
This description of the bygone days seeps into his oil on canvas paintings poetically. For example, ‘A beautiful despair’ oxymoronically conjures an image that highlights an aesthetic value of life which stems from sadness – without compromising on the intangibility of sorrow. 
Another piece that merits mention is ‘Full moon from the car parking’. The moon, as is common knowledge, signifies the rhythm of time, a recurring theme in Raza’s works. 
His strokes are gentle and the colours that he uses have diction of their own. Most of all, it is his solid lines that put across his ideas with visual ease… allowing silence to speak.      
The exhibition concludes on Sept 10.

13,"Mohenjo Daro may be removed from world heritage list, warns official","Walls of several structures crumbling after rains; urgent repair required, authorities informed.","LARKANA: The department of archaeology has called for urgent attention towards conservation and restoration work at Mohenjo Daro apprehending that the site may be removed from the world heritage list if such work was not carried out. 
Sources said on Saturday that archaeological ruins of Mohenjo Daro had received record rains, measured at 779.5mm, which continued from Aug 16 to 26. It resulted in considerable damage to the site and partial falling of several walls, including the protection wall of the stupa dome.
It was learnt that the curator of the site in his Aug 29 letter to the director culture, antiquities and archaeology said “we have put in efforts to protect the site with our resources”. The role of other departments — irrigation, roads, highways and forest — was quite essential for safeguarding the world heritage site, as landlords and farmers had not only inserted pipes and given cuts to canals and roads to release water into Mohenjo Daro’s channel. However, due to negligence on the part of above-mentioned departments, the rainwater from nearby agriculture lands had filled disposal channel, the sources said. 
This caused delay in driving out water from the site, the letter said, adding that water had entered even into the campus. After rains, the official concerned at the site had said: “We are facing another emergency in the shape of a consatnt rise in the Indus level.” 

Walls of several structures crumbling after rains; urgent repair required, authorities informed

Although water level in Indus is low, due to the construction of metal road on the protection dyke near Mohenjo Daro, paired with occurrence of fissures, cavities and dangerous gullies, the department had approached local irrigation officials but in vain, according to the letter. No one had turned up to inspect the site and assess the situation, it said.
The archaeology official had called for immediate contact with the irrigation and roads departments for the repair of bund, breached canal dykes and removal of pipes. 
The curator has proposed sending of experts (conservators and engineers) for an assessment of the damage caused to the site during downpours. Presently, the archaeology officials posted at Mohenjo Daro are busy repairing the damaged portions of the structures.

14,"Efforts under way to save Dadu,Sehwan, Larkana and other cities from devastation, says CM","KARACHI: Chief Mini­ster Syed Murad Ali Shah on Saturday took an aerial view of different protective dykes,...","KARACHI: Chief Mini­ster Syed Murad Ali Shah on Saturday took an aerial view of different protective dykes, including the Larkana-Sehwan (LS) embankment, and said they were not weak though vulnerable and hopefully would survive with constant efforts by Irrigation engineers and the district administration.
He along with provincial minister Taimour Talpur flew into Sehwan where he took an aerial view of different embankments, including Manchhar Containing (MC) Bund, MNV Bund, Johi branch, and LS Bund over River Indus. 
Mr Shah said that these embankments were vulnerable, but irrigation engineers were monitoring the situation and working day and night on their strengthening. He hoped that their efforts in protecting Shewan, Mehar, Johi, Dadu, and Larkana would meet success.
He noted that the level of Manchhar Lake had recorded at 122.75 RL on Saturday while the level of its embankment known as MC Bund was 128 RL. 
“Stone-pitching was under way but winds were so violent and causing wave-washing, therefore, more stones were required for pitching,” he said, and added that the material was being arranged.
The chief minister said that the continuous flow of water into Manchhar had increased its spread-up over a radius of 130 square kilometres. “In 2010, Manchhar had broken its banks when its level had reached 121.65 RL but then repair and strengthening works were carried out. Therefore. it had sustained pressure at 122.75 RL which was higher by 1.1 feet, he said.
Mr Shah said that currently, 16,000 cusecs from Manchhar were flowing into River Indus but the situation would turn better when the river would start accepting 30,000 to 40,000 cusecs from the lake.
He said that when the water level at Guddu and Sukkur would come down to 300,000 cusecs, the gates of the Sukkur Barrage would be closed to discharge Manchhar water into the River. “Right now, the Sukkur Barrage is flowing at 559,998 cusecs, therefore, the River Indus is not accepting Manchhar’s water in much quantity,” he observed.
Mr Shah said that there was no benefit of applying a cut to Manchhar bank because its water, instead of flowing into the river, would form another lake within the area. Therefore, it was advisable to wait for decrease in the level of the river and by that time we should strengthen the MC bund.
The CM, while taking an aerial view of Johi branch and LS Bund, said that Khairpur Nathan Shah had been inundated but proper vigilance and monitoring was being done to avoid any breach in Johi branch to save Dadu. 
He added that the Ring Bund of Mehar was vulnerable but not so weak to develop a breach. “The irrigation experts are working on further strengthening the Ring Bund to protect Mehar and Johi,” he added.
