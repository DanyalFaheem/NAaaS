0,Murad inaugurates command and control centre for Rescue 1122 services,Says MQM-P is not a coalition partner in Sindh,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister (CM) Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday inaugurated the Central Command & Control (CC&C) at the headquarters of Rescue 1122 – a comprehensive package of rescue, relief and rehabilitation – established with the support of the World Bank for emergency assistance for people affected by accidents and disasters.
Addressing the opening ceremony, he said the state-of-the-art CC&C had been established in Karachi to provide ambulatory services, fire services, urban search and rescue services, water rescue services through one number: 1122. “It’s the very first-time that a government-owned emergency rescue service is launched in the province,” he added.
Accompanied by his advisers Barrister Murtaza Wahab and Rasool Bux Chandio, the CM said that state-of-the-art medical health facilities had been established in four districts of Karachi and one in Larkana along with the set-up of rescue stations. “The Central Command & Control is established in Karachi for different rescue services through one number: 1122,” he said.
He said the Water Rescue Service would deal with the issues of urban flooding and a plan was under way to integrate police emergency service into Rescue 1122.

Says MQM-P is not a coalition partner in Sindh

“The 1122 service is working in the districts of Karachi, Larkana, Thatta, Sujawal, Qambar-Shahdadkot, and Hyderabad and it will be launched in Badin district within the next two days,” he said, adding that 12 districts would be added to Rescue 1122.
Mr Shah announced that the rescue service would also be established on main inter-city highways of the province after every 50km for which locations had already been identified where work was in progress.
The CM said the first batch of 107 cadets was provided with specialized rescue training from Punjab, and another batch of 315 cadets was under training. “These are purely technical positions,” he said and added the Rescue 1122 was modeled after successful emergency services elsewhere in Pakistan.
He said he himself had dialed 1122 from his mobile phone and lodged a complaint about a fire in the Sadar area and the operator asked him the location. “I have advised the Central Command and Control administration to update/upgrade the 1122 service software so that the location of the complainant could automatically start reflecting on the screen,” he said. In this way, fake complaints could automatically be identified, and the genuine ones would be addressed at the earliest without unnecessary queries.
Later, talking to media and responding to questions, the CM said the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) was not a coalition partner of the Pakistan Peoples Party-led government in the province, but a good working relationship had been developed with them.
“MQM-P leaders have no issue with the provincial government, but one of them might have some reservations individually on which the media should not waste its time,” he added. 
Answering another question, CM Shah said the Punjab governor under Article 130 (7) of the constitution had the power to call the assembly session for the chief minister to take a vote of confidence. “The objection made by the speaker on calling the session by the governor is not valid,” he added.
The CM advised his counterpart in Punjab to take the vote of confidence instead of going to the court of law. “The chief minister has to take a vote of confidence to show his majority,” he added.
Mr Shah said he had held a high-level meeting a day before, giving clear instructions to the law enforcement agencies to launch a vigorous operation against street criminals.
He said the citizens had lost their lives during the past two weeks while resisting muggings. “The police have made some arrests, he said, holding out assurance: “The killers will be brought to book at any cost.” Some of the habitual criminals had been released by the court for which he had directed his prosecutors to focus on investigation and made the cases strong, he said. 
In reply to a question, the chief minister said Barrister Wahab, as an administrator of the KMC, worked hard. “Though he has no need of any official responsibility to serve the people, but he will be doing it as a party worker,” he added.

1,Experts call for legislation to prevent spread of antimicrobial resistance,"KARACHI: Highlighting how grave the problem of antimicrobial resistance has become in the country, speakers at a...","KARACHI: Highlighting how grave the problem of antimicrobial resistance has become in the country, speakers at a session on Friday called for legislation to prevent its spread.
The event — Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a threat to modern medicine — was held at the Dow Medical College (DMC) as part of its continuing medical education sessions. 
In her remarks, Dr Sara Salman underscored the need for a multi-sectoral approach to prevent AMR’s spread. 
“So far, we have failed to implement the plans and strategies to combat AMR. The reason being lack of a multi-dimensional approach and action,” she said, while calling for an effective AMR surveillance system.
Doctors, she pointed out, must play their due role by ensuring that antibiotics were recommended only when necessary and counselling patients on the proper use of antibiotics, telling them how long the drugs should be used and how to avoid their side effects.
“Besides, we need to regulate pharmaceutical companies to ensure quality and sales of antibiotics,” she noted, warning of the consequences, if authorities couldn’t take timely action. 
DMC Principal Prof Dr Saba Sohail, who was the chief guest, shared that AMR was a major threat to public health and must be checked in healthcare settings as well as environment. 
“Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens. There is an immediate need for public awareness to ensure that antibiotics are used only on doctor’s prescription,” she said. 
The speakers also explained how the excessive use of antibiotics increased patient’s vulnerability for getting infected with a resistant organism. 
“Resistance enhances mortality risk. Hence, it’s important to choose the right antibiotic by following three simple steps; diagnosing correctly, taking the patient’s history and physical examination,” she said, while emphasising the need for preventing hospital acquired infections.
About the burden of antimicrobial resistance, Dr Afia Zafar of the Aga Khan University Hospital said the situation was challenging but success could be achieved with everyone’s support. 
“The emergence and spread of AMR is a complex issue, involving multiple actors. One intervention could be improving the diagnostic capacity to minimise use of antibiotics,” she said. 
Dr Samreen Sarfaraz from the Indus Hospital shared that an estimated 1.4 million people were affected globally by hospital-acquired infections.
“The lack of infection control measures, such as poor sanitation and waste management, are important reasons for the spread of infections in healthcare settings,” she said.

4,Shaikh Ayaz a ‘universal poet’ in Bhitai’s mould,"Literati from Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan present papers at opening session of ‘Ayaz Melo’","HYDERABAD: Literati coming from different province to attend Ayaz Melo (festival) termed Shaikh Ayaz a ‘universal poet’ after Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai, saying he had blended the classical heritage legacy of Sindh with modernism to give a new meaningfulness to his content. They said it was Ayaz who taught people the romance with their motherland by projecting Sindh as his beloved.  They said that thanks to Shaikh Ayaz, it was Sindh that led anti-One Unit struggle while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab were nowhere.
Speakers from Punjab, Balochistan and Sindh presented their papers and delivered speeches at the inaugural session of the eighth ‘Ayaz Melo’ that got underway at Sindh Museum under the aegis of Khanabadosh writers cafe in collaboration with the provincial culture department here on Friday evening.
Sindh Minister for Culture Syed Sardar Ali Shah inaugurated the festival at a ceremony which was moderated by Dr Arfana Mallah and attended by celebrated author Noorul Huda Shah, journalist Asma Shirazi, Jami Chandio, Nasir Abbas Nayyar (from Punjab) and Shah Mohammad Marri (from Balochistan). Amar Sindhu, chief of the festival’s organising committee, welcomed the guests and gave an overview of the event which she said was itself reflective of the fact that all seven editions of the past had also been successful.
Sardar Shah in his presidential address described Bhitai and Ayaz as universal poets. Bhitai had dreamt of a prosperous Sindh while he rejected alien language like Persian. “Ayaz’s mistake was that he produced a Persianised translation of Bhitai’s Shah Jo Risalo because Bhitai had discussed Sindh’s local ecology instead of an alien one,” Sardar Shah said. He said that Ayaz had experienced last decades of colonial era and seen Hindus migrating from Sindh and a division of his motherland while Bhitai witnessed Portuguese invasion of Thatta. “Ayaz witnessed Sindh as separate homeland being converted to a commissionerate,” he added.

Literati from Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan present papers at opening session of ‘Ayaz Melo’

Nayyar, presenting his lengthy paper, said this event was a step to connect Pakistan’s literati with each other. “In fact, Sindh has three rivers – Sindhu [Indus], Bhitai and Shaikh Ayaz -- and ‘Sindhri’ is the collective name of these rivers,” he observed, and explained that “while Indus flows on earth, the verses of these two poets flow continuously in imagination of Sindhi people … while Indus gets flows, poetry of Bhitai and Ayaz never get dried”. Besides Sindhi, he said, Ayaz had command and full grip of Persian, English and Urdu languages. Ayaz had first started writing in Urdu and then made a conscious decision to write in his mother tongue, Sindhi, for which he had travelled to Sukkur from Karachi. Ayaz had equated his poetry with rising sun over Mohenjo Daro, he added.
Nayyar said Shaikh Ayaz had taken Sindhi literature to pinnacle of literature which had only been seen in Bhitai’s work. 
Shah Mohammad Marri, a Baloch intellectual, likened Ayaz with his province’s mountain called, Mir Dad Jabal, that has four peaks. In literary sense, he said, one would hardly be able to describe these four peaks of Ayaz, who wrote on Sindh’s hunger and starvation. 
He noted that Ayaz had successfully discussed ‘fire’ and ‘romanticism’ simultaneously. He lauded Ayaz’s translation of Bhitai’s poetry as one of his best works. The great poet [Bhitai] kept responding to international conditions all the time. This struggle produced Gul Khan Naseer in Balochistan, Habib Jalib in Punjab, Ajmal Khattak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Shaikh Ayaz and Rasool Bux Palijo in Sindh. “It will be a crime if we confine Ayaz to the poets’ fold because he had fought on multiple fronts. His role in anti-One Unit struggle was exemplary,” said the Baloch writer, who undertook to translate preface of Ayaz’s translation of Bhitai’s Risalo.
Jami Chandio contended that Ayaz had blended classic asset legacy of Sindh with modernised Sindh to redefine the society. He termed Ayaz continuity of Indo-Pakistan subcontinent’s legacy. It was his uniqueness that Ayaz produced prose, ghazal and geet simultaneously and that’s why he was still influencing hearts and minds of youth, Jami said. 
Celebrated author Noorul Huda Shah said that while she was elated to see Sindhi youths bringing their sisters to this event to dance but she felt dejected to recall conditions seen in flood-affected areas of Sindh during recent flooding. She said people were still homeless and displaced. She was delighted to find youth dreaming for a new Sindh and gave full credit to this spirit to organisers, Amar Sindhu and Arfana Mallah, whose profile had always been stigmatised by Sindhi society. She said it was positive to note that Ayaz was being discussed at ‘melas’ instead of drawing rooms. 
“Ayaz had taught people how to love with their motherland because in Sindhi language, Sindh is feminine as gender,” she remarked and said that “had Shaikh not produced Sindhi poetry, there would have been no Sindhi literature today to talk about”. 
Today, a Sindhi writer’s survival lies in producing Sindhi content and only Ayaz could be credited for this, said Noorul Huda Shah.

His government had not yet taken a decision on federal government’s proposals for closure of markets by 8pm, marriage halls and restaurants by 10pm and having 20 per cent workforce do work from home, the chief minister said while talking to journalists during his visit to Shikarpur and outside Bhuttos’ mausoleum in Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto on Friday.  “We will communicate [to federal government] our reply after consulting all the stakeholders,” he said.  
At the mausoleum, he said the proposals were part of prime minister’s directive, which was communicated by federal minister Khawaja Asif during his visit to Karachi along with other ministers. 
The measures the Sindh government had taken to combat COVID-19 were later followed by the centre, he said. “We have gathered here to review arrangements for a grand public meeting to be held on Dec 27 to mark the 15th death anniversary of slain PPP leader Benazir Bhutto.  
He said that thousands of people from all around the country would participate in the gathering to pay respect to their leader.  
The chief minister, who earlier chaired meeting of mazar committee and divisional and district administration along with PPP Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, asked the administration to make foolproof arrangements for security and effective traffic control to facilitate the participants.  
Murad told journalists in Shikarpur after expressing condolence with bereaved family of army soldier Saeed Soomro who recently embraced martyrdom in Bannu. Soomro was indeed the luckiest person to have death of martyrdom, he said.

6,"Five children, woman drown as bus slides into floodwaters in Larkana",Second incident of its kind within eight weeks took place at unplugged relief cut site near Sujawal town of Larkana.,"LARKANA: At least six persons — a woman and five children — drowned after a speeding bus carrying 26-30 people slid into stagnant floodwaters near Sujawal town, some 40 kilometres from here, on Friday evening. More than 20 people were stated to have been under treatment due to injuries and water intake.
The bus was transporting a wedding party from Wali Chandio village to Sukkur, officials at the Sanjar Bhatti police station said.
The deceased woman was identified as Gohar Begum and the children as nine-month-old Ahmed Raza, Kashif Gurgej,10, Younis Chandio, 5, Faheem Chandio, 4, and Suleman Jatoi, 4.
Rescue work by residents of nearby villages was continuing till the last reports came in late in the evening.
Three of the injured persons, four-month-old Abdul Samad Chandio, one-year-old Sitara Zangijo and 18-year-old Asifa Chandio, were admitted to the Chandka Medical College Hospital and the others to the Mirokhan Taluka Hospital, sources said.

Second incident of its kind within eight weeks took place at unplugged relief cut site near Sujawal town of Larkana

Another source said that the accident took place at a site where plugging of a relief cut, applied to facilitate diversion of floodwaters, had remained unfinished. 
A police post existing paces away from the site was informed about the accident but no official help could turn up promptly while men, women and children trapped in the bus were screaming and shouting in distress. A video clip uploaded on a YouTube channel showed helpless victims crying for help. 
After much delay, a crane arrived to lift the bus out of water but it ran out of fuel before accomplishing the task. The exact number of casualties could only be known after completion of the rescue work, the sources said.
As many as 20 people, including 11 children, were killed and more than a dozen others injured in a similar accident in Sehwan on Nov 18 when a minibus carrying families and their relatives from Khairpur to the shrine of Sufi saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar plunged into floodwaters near Sehwan. 
The driver could not notice, due to darkness, the signboard warning drivers of the danger ahead. Relatives of the victims had alleged that proper arrangements at the site of a wide cut, applied to give way to floodwaters, were not made to prevent such accident. The cut had caused an eight feet deep artificial waterway.

KARACHI: Simon Glasson, principal of the Karachi Grammar School (KGS), passed away in London on Thursday evening. He was 56.
Mr Glasson had been fighting cancer for a few years now and he had been in London for treatment. 
His death was announced by the Principal’s office in KGS through a notification shared on Friday. 
Paying rich tribute to him, the letter remembered him as a “kind, warm and considerate person who took genuine interest in everything related to the school.
“He was an immense support for the KGS and his positive energy always made an impact. His popularity spanned across students, parents and alumni. He fought his illness bravely putting on a courageous front and always smiling.” 
Before joining KGS as principal in 2019, Mr Glasson was previously the principal of The City School’s PAF Chapter. The news of his passing has deeply saddened all his friends, students and old acquaintances. Calling it a huge loss to education, some also took to social media to pay tribute to him.
Everyone remembered him as a thorough gentleman and a staunch supporter of using education to bring about beneficial social change in society. He liked Pakistan and its people very much and enjoyed working and living here.
One of his older students from The City School said that he and his schoolmates thought that he looked a lot like the character Agent Smith in the Matrix movies whenever they saw him wearing his dark sunglasses.

9,Bail plea of widow of Aamir Liaquat dismissed,Dania Shah was booked and arrested by FIA from her house in Lodhran on Dec 15.,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Friday dismissed an application seeking grant of bail to the widow of late politician and anchorperson Aamir Liaquat Hussain in a case pertaining to allegedly leaking his obscene videos on social media.
Dania Shah was booked and arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from her house in Lodhran on Dec 15.
Judicial Magistrate (East) Mukesh Kumar pronounced his order reserved after hearing arguments from the defence and prosecution on the bail plea of Ms Shah, who is currently in judicial custody.
The magistrate observed that the matter was at a premature stage of investigation, since no investigation report under Section 173 of the criminal procedure code had been filed yet.
He noted that while “no sexually explicit videos of the late lawmaker were recovered from the possession of Shah” the prosecutor claimed that all such videos had been deleted from her gadgets by the suspect.
The judge remarked that the material collected during the investigation into the matter so far apparently connected the widow with the commissioning of the alleged offence.
He stated that the suspect prima facie violated the victim’s fundamental rights to dignity, privacy and modesty, which are inalienable rights of every person and as per the complainant’s counsel, the release of Aamir Liaquat’s personal videos in public sphere was the main cause of his death.
Dua Aamir, daughter of the late TV anchor, had lodged an FIR against Dania Shah under Sections 20 (malicious code), 21 (cyberstalking) and 24 (legal recognition of offences committed in relation to information system) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.

10,"Time’s up for vehicles with illegal sirens, fancy plates, tinted glasses in Karachi",SHC censures officials over movement of heavy vehicles during daytime in city.,"• Removal of locally tinted glasses, fancy number plates, pressure horns ordered
• SHC censures officials over movement of heavy vehicles during daytime in city
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has directed the traffic police to take action against use of tinted glasses, sirens, revolving and bar lights, hooters and unauthorised number plates in vehicles in the provincial capital.  
The SHC expressed displeasure over the chief secretary of Sindh for not filing a compliance report about implementation of an apex court’s order regarding heavy traffic in the city despite specific directives issued at a court hearing.   
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Nadeem Akhtar again directed the chief secretary to file comprehensive compliance report till Jan 25 failing which he should be in attendance to assist the court.   
At the outset of the hearing, DIG-traffic Ahmed Nawaz Cheema turned up along with a report and stated that check posts had been established on all entry and exit points to ensure restriction of heavy vehicles in the city between 6am and 11pm.   
The DIG stated that traffic police were implementing the orders of the apex court about heavy traffic in letter and spirit.   
However, the counsel for petitioners submitted that congestion in traffic and road accidents had reduced, but the court orders were still being flouted as heavy vehicles, other than exempted ones, still plying on roads during daytime.   
The DIG further argued that traffic police had also taken action against illegal use of pressure horns, fancy and unauthorised number plates, locally tinted glasses, hooters, sirens and revolving & bar lights in vehicles.   
However, he conceded that illegal use such items could not be fully controlled yet.   
The bench directed him to submit the names/list of such vehicles/persons who were legally authorised to use hooters/sirens and revolving/bar lights.   
The court further directed the DIG to publish a public notice in leading newspapers within three days for removal of all pressure horns, locally tinted glasses, unauthorised number plate, etc, from vehicles within seven days from the date of publication of notice.   
A statement was filed by the secretary of services, general administration & coordination department stating that letters had been issued to relevant authorities for compliance with court orders.   
However, the bench noted that on a previous hearing it had specifically directed the chief secretary to submit a detailed compliance report about implementation of the apex court order, but no such report had been filed by him.   
The lawyers for the parties and a provincial law officer requested that National Highway and Motorway Authority and Traffic Engineering Bureau might be impleaded as respondents in these proceedings as their presence was necessary for implementation of court orders passed by the Supreme Court as well as the SHC.   
While allowing the request, the bench said let an amended title be filed within three days whereafter notice be issued to newly-added respondents for next hearing.   
The Supreme Court had issued the order in August 2007 banning heavy traffic during day hours.   
Several petitions were filed in the SHC between 2010 and 2022 about heavy vehicles and implementation of the Supreme Court order.

12,Three indicted for kidnapping Nazim Jokhio,MPA Jam Awais and other accused have already been indicted for the murder,"KARACHI: A sessions court on Friday framed an amended charge against three guards of interned Pakistan Peoples Party lawmaker Jam Awais in the Nazim Jokhio murder case.
MPA Awais along with his six guards has already been indicted for torturing to death 26-year-old Jokhio at his farmhouse and concealing evidence in November 2021.
On Tuesday, Additional District and Sessions Judge (Malir) Faraz Ahmed Chandio indicted Muhammad Soomar Salar, Doda Khan alias Dada and Niaz Salar for kidnapping Jokhio before his murder.
Soomar Salar and Khan, who were present on bail, denied the allegation and opted to contest the case. However, accused Niaz Salari, who is purportedly absconding, failed to appear in court.
The judge summoned the prosecution witnesses to record their testimonies against the accused on the next date and fixed the matter for Jan 12.

MPA Jam Awais and other accused have already been indicted for the murder

Two days ago, the state prosecutor had moved an application pleading the court to indict the lawmaker’s three guards under Section 365 of the Pakistan Penal Code for kidnapping the victim before his brutal murder.
The prosecutor had stated that the court had on Dec 10 indicted MPA Awais along with Niaz Salar, Ahmed Shoro, Haider Ali, Meer Ali, Muhammad Soomar Salar and Doda Khan alias Dada for murdering young Jokhio.
However, he pointed out, that the charge of kidnapping the victim before his murder was yet to be framed against Soomar, Dodar Khan and Niaz Salari. 
He pleaded to charge them for the offence of kidnapping.
Under the penal code, no out-of-court settlement can be reached in the offence of kidnapping.
The state prosecutor had maintained that the remaining accused including MPA Awais would only face the charge of only premeditated murder.
Under the law, a person facing the ‘premeditated murder’ charge can be pardoned by victim’s legal heirs either by accepting blood money or without it.
Meanwhile, the judge fixed Jan 12 as the date of hearing on the applications filed by victim’s mother Jamiat, brother Afzal Jokhio and widow Shireen seeking validation of their “out-of-court settlement” with lawmaker Awais and co-accused.
Along with their pleas, the trio had also filed affidavits stating that they had pardoned the MPA Awais and others in the name of Almighty “without accepting blood money”.
However, later on Ms Shireen demanded that the lawmaker deposit with the court a collective amount of Rs3,058,955 as the share in the blood money of Nazim Jokhio’s four minor children — Rabia, Sabiha, Zainab and Basit.
On the next date of hearing, the judge would take up an application filed by the National Commission for Human Rights seeking to become an intervener in the murder trial proceedings.
