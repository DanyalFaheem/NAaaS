0,Gunman kills three at Kurdish centre in Paris,"Shooter was deliberately seeking out foreigners, says interior minister.","PARIS: A 69-year-old gunman opened fire at a Kurdish cultural centre and a hairdressing salon in Paris on Friday, killing three people and injuring three others, witnesses and prosecutors said. 
The shots shortly before midday (1100 GMT) caused panic in rue d’Enghien in the trendy 10th district of the capital, a bustling area of shops and restaurants that is home to a large Kurdish population. 
Witnesses said the gunman, described by police as white and previously charged with racist violence, initially targeted the Kurdish cultural centre before entering a hairdressing salon where he was arrested by police. 
“We saw an old white man enter, then start shooting in the Kurdish cultural centre, then he went to the hairdresser’s next door,” Romain, who works in a nearby restaurant, said by telephone. 
Of the three wounded people, one is in intensive care and two are being treated for serious injuries, officials said. 

Shooter was deliberately seeking out foreigners, says interior minister

The Kurdish community centre, called Centre Ahmet Kaya, is used by a charity that organises concerts and exhibitions, and helps the Kurdish diaspora in the Paris region. 
The gunman was described by police sources as “Caucasian”, of French nationality, and was linked to two previous attempted murders in 2016 and 2021. 
The gunman was deliberately seeking out foreigners, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. The man, a retired train driver, “was clearly targeting foreigners”, Darmanin told reporters, adding however that it was “not certain” that the man was aiming to kill “Kurds in particular”. 
The retired train driver was initially convicted over the first case in the multicultural Seine-Saint-Denis suburb of Paris, but freed on appeal, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told reporters without giving further details.
In the second case, he was charged with racist violence after allegedly attacking migrants sleeping in tents in the Bercy area of the city in December 2021, Beccuau added. 
At least two migrants were stabbed, a police source said at the time. “As for a racist motive for this case, this will obviously form part of our investigations which are starting now,” she said. 
The shooter was released on bail recently and suffered facial injuries on Friday, requiring hospital treatment. 
France’s specialised anti-terror prosecutor’s office has not taken over the case so far, indicating that the triple murder is being treated as regular violent crime at this stage. 
The far right seems to have struck again. With deadly consequences,” senior left-wing MP Clementine Autain wrote on Twitter. “When will those at the head of the state take this terrorist threat seriously?” But the Kurdish Democratic Council of France (CDK-F), which uses the cultural centre as its headquarters, said in a statement that it considered the shooting to be a “terror attack”. 
Prime Minister Elizabeth Borne called the shooting an “odious attack” and sent her “full support to the victims and their loved ones.” 
Clash with police 
Kurdish demonstrators clashed with police in central Paris  after the shooting incident. Police deployed outside the cultural centre used teargas to disperse  the protesters who tried to break through a police cordon protecting  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin who had arrived at the scene, AFP  reporters said. Demonstrators threw objects at police in response, set rubbish bins on fire and erected barricades, they said. 
Several cars parked in the area as well as police vehicles had their windows smashed as protesters threw bricks.

1,US provides $200m for gender equality,"Authorisation of funds to promote gender equality programmes, however, prohibits spending any of it on abortions.","WASHINGTON: The US Senate has passed a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending package for fiscal 2023 and it includes $200 million for promoting gender equality in Pakistan. 
The package, passed on Thursday evening, includes $858 billion for defence, $787bn for non-defence domestic programmes and over $15bn for other programmes. 
An omnibus bill is a single document that pieces together several measures into one and as the last piece of legislature to pass this year, it will fund the US federal government through September 2023. 
The authorisation of funds for promoting gender equality programmes, however, prohibits spending any of the $200m on abortions. Yet, this is a whopping increase in the last few years. 
In December 2020, the US congress cleared $10m for promoting gender equality and $15m for strengthening democracy in Pakistan. The $200m allotted for 2023 is a 20-fold increase from the 2020 allocation for Pakistan. 
On the Global Gender Gap Report 2022 of the World Economic Forum, Pakistan ranked 145 out of 146 on the gender equality index. 
Afghanistan was 146 and India 135 on the index. Bangladesh and Nepal lead regional performance with over 69 per cent of their gender gaps closed. Bangladesh was 71 and Nepal 96.

2,Israeli security forces shoot Arab man after attack attempt,An uncle of the deceased says his nephew was innocent.,"KAFR QASSEM: Israeli officers on Friday shot dead an Arab-Israeli man after he attempted to fire at them and then rammed them with his car near Tel Aviv, the police said. 
The incident occurred in Kafr Qassem, an Arab-Israeli city on the edge of Tel Aviv and just outside the occupied West Bank. Vio­lence has surged in the West Bank since March when Israel began near daily raids following a series of deadly attacks targeting Israelis. 
In a statement, police said the suspect had called police on the pretext of “a violent incident”, which brought them to Kafr Qassem. “When police arrived on the scene he ran at them with a gun, and then got into his car and knocked them down,” the police statement said. 
Three officers were injured before the suspect was “neutralised by shooting”, it added. Sobhi Bedir, an uncle of the dead man, Naim Mahmoud Bedir, said his nephew was innocent. “When the police kill a Palestinian in Israel, they say he is a terrorist or planning an attack,” he said. 
At least 150 Palestinians and 26 Israelis have been killed this year across Israel, the occupied West Bank and Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem.

3,Dar-led body formed to do away with Riba,Body to provide strategic guidance on legal and regulatory actions required to implement FSC’s verdict on Riba.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday constituted a 14-member steering committee comprising religious scholars, bankers, chartered accountants and industrialists to provide a strategic direction for elimination of Riba within a five-year deadline set by the Federal Shariat Court (FSC). 
Under the ‘patronage’ of Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, the committee will have eight private sector members and five ex-officio members from the government side, according to a notification issued by the finance ministry. 
The private sector members include Maulana Mufti Muhammad Taqi Usmani, President of Wifaqul Madaris; Mufti Irshad Ahmad Aijaz, Chairman of Shariah Advisory Committee of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP); Mansurur Rehman Khan, President and CEO of Institute of Bankers Pakistan; Ashfaq Tola, Chairman of Pakistan Reforms and Resource Modernisation Comm­ission, Khozem A. Haidermota, Senior Partner, Haidermota & Co, Saeed Ahmad, former deputy governor of SBP, Irfan Siddiqi, President, Meezan Bank and Mian Muhammad Adrees, CEO, Sitara Chemical Industries. 
The ex-officio members include SBP governor, deputy governor of FIDFS & IT SBP, finance division secretary, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission of Pakistan and Pakistan Banks Association chairman. 
Under the terms of reference, the steering committee would provide strategic guidance on the legal and regulatory reforms and actions required for implementation of FSC’s verdict on Riba. It would also suggest capacity-building measures of the stakeholders for full implementation of the FSC’s decision and monitor the progress of implementation of the FSC’s judgment, and remove the bottlenecks. 
Finance Minister Dar announced in November the government’s decision that the SBP and the National Bank of Pakistan would immediately withdraw appeals against the FSC order for complete elimination of Riba (interest) by transforming banking in the country by Dec 31, 2027 as required under the Holy Quran and Sunnah. 
The FSC in its April 28 order also directed the federal and provincial governments to complete the necessary legislation and bring all laws into conformity with the injunctions of Islam by 2027 deadline and adopt to Shariah compliant modes in future while borrowing from domestic or foreign sources. 
While the SBP, NBP and three leading private commercial banks — MCB, United Bank Limited and Allied Bank Limited — had challenged the FSC decision in the apex court,  the SBP and NBP withdrew their appeals later. 
Minister of State for Finance Aisha Ghaus Pasha earlier testified before a parliamentary panel it was clear that everything would not be converted to 100pc Islamic system within five years, because the country and its financial system were internationally integrated but there was a lot of appetite for Islamic system among the majority population as some multilateral institutions were also using such products.

4,16 Indian soldiers killed in Sikkim accident,NEW DELHI: Sixteen soldiers were killed in India’s remote northeast on Friday when a military truck transporting...,"NEW DELHI: Sixteen soldiers were killed in India’s remote northeast on Friday when a military truck transporting them skidded down a steep mountain slope and crashed, the army said. 
The accident occurred in the state of Sikkim while the truck carrying the soldiers was negotiating a treacherous turn in a mountainous area near the border with China. 
“A rescue mission was immediately launched, and four injured soldiers have been air evacuated,” the Indian army’s eastern command said in a statement, confirming three officers and 13 soldiers had died of injuries after the accident. 
Sikkim has some of India’s most dangerous high-altitude roads, particularly along its isolated Himalayan border with Tibet. 
Accidents involving army vehicles near the vast boundary with China and Pak­istan leave many soldiers dead each year. 
In August, six paramilitaries were killed in an accident in India-held Kashmir when an armoured vehicle carrying them rolled down a mountain slope.

5,Deep freeze grips US as winter ‘bomb cyclone’ looms,"More than 5,000 flights cancelled ahead of holiday weekend.","WASHINGTON: A deep freeze enveloping most of the United States early on Friday combined with a massive winter storm brewing in the Midwest to leave two-thirds of the nation under extreme weather alerts, confounding travel plans for millions of Americans. 
Heading into the Christmas holiday weekend, the looming storm was forecast to develop into a “bomb cyclone,” unleashing heavy, blinding snow from the northern Plains and Great Lakes region to the upper Mississippi Valley and western New York. 
Numbing cold intensified by high winds was expected to extend as far south as the US-Mexico border. Hard-freeze warnings were posted across the Gulf Coast states of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and Florida, while significant icing was possible from a separate arctic blast hitting the Pacific Northwest. 
By late Thursday, most of the Lower 48 states, from Washington state to Florida, were under wind-chill alerts, blizzard warnings or other winter weather advisories affecting more than 200 million people, about 60 per cent of the US population, the National Weather Service (NWS) reported. 

More than 5,000 flights cancelled ahead of holiday weekend

The NWS map of existing or impending wintry hazards, stretching from border to border and coast to coast, “depicts one of the greatest extents of winter weather warnings and advisories ever”, the agency said. 
The bomb cyclone could unleash snowfalls of a half inch (1.25cm) per hour driven by gale-force winds, cutting visibility to near zero, the weather service said.
Combined with the arctic cold, wind-chill factors as low as 40 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius) were forecast in the High Plains, the northern Rockies and the Great Basin, the NWS said. Exposure to such conditions without adequate protection can cause frostbite within minutes. 
Power outages were expected from high winds, heavy snow and ice, as well as the strain of higher-than-usual energy demands. 
One of the greatest immediate impacts, even before the storm fully took shape, was the upending of commercial air traffic during the busy holiday travel period. 
Thousands of flights canceled More than 5,000 US flights scheduled for Thursday and Friday were canceled, with two major airports in Chicago accounting for nearly 1,300 of the cancellations, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. 
One would-be holiday traveler, Brandon Mattis, 24, said on Thursday his flight from New York City to Atlanta was canceled due to the coming storm, leaving him “flustered” at LaGuardia Airport in Queens. 
Mattis said he searched for alternate routes and was even considering a 21-hour bus ride to Atlanta. “Anything we can do just to get there, we’re going to do,” he said. 
The American Automobile Asso­ciation had estimated that 112.7 million people planned to travel 50 miles (80km) or more from home between Dec 23 and Jan 2, up 3.6m travelers over last year and closing in on pre-pandemic numbers. But that number was likely to be diminished by air and road travel complicated by treacherous weather leading into the weekend. 
Even US President Biden urged Americans to think twice about venturing out after Thursday, calling the gathering storm “dangerous and threatening”. “This is not like a snow day, when you were a kid, this is serious stuff,” he said in comments at the White House on Thursday. 
The extreme cold also posed a particular hazard to livestock in ranching-intensive regions of the country. Tyson Foods Inc, the nation’s leading meat producer by sales, said it had scaled back operations to protect employees and animals. 
The weather service said relief from the deep freeze was in sight for the northern Rockies and High Plains, where the arctic blast first materialised on Thursday. Tempe­ratures in parts of those regions could rebound by 40 to 60 degrees over the weekend as the cold air mass creeps farther east.
