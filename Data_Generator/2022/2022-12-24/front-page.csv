LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday suspended Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman’s late-night order de-notifying the chief minister, restoring Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and his cabinet on the assurance that the provincial assembly will not be dissolved, at least until the next date of hearing — Jan 11.  
The ruling coalition at the Centre, led by the PML-N, termed it a ‘temporary relief’ for CM Elahi, while the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and its ally PML-Q insisted the Punjab Assem­bly would be dissolved at the end of the day even if the chief minister has to seek a vote of confidence from the house.  
Governor Rehman sprang into action late on Thursday night and de-notified Mr Elahi as the Punjab chief minister for failing to seek a vote of confidence from the house as directed by him (governor) under Article 130(7) of the Constitution — in a bid to forestall PTI chief Imran Khan’s plan to dissolve the provincial assembly. The order was immediately called “illegal” by Mr Elahi, who had said he would move the court against it.  
On Friday, a full bench headed by Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh held a marathon hearing on a hurriedly filed petition by Elahi challenging his de-notification. Justice Chaudhry Muhammad Iqbal, Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh, Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabir and Justice Asim Hafeez were the other members on the bench. 
At the outset of the hearing, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, appearing on behalf of Mr Elahi, argued that the governor issued the impugned notification without lawful authority, as he could not ask the CM to seek a vote of confidence when the assembly was already in session as summoned by the speaker.  
He said during a session summoned by the speaker, the governor could not call a new one unless the ongoing session was prorogued by the speaker. The counsel further argued that the governor’s order was not sustainable in the eyes of law, as a no-confidence motion filed by the opposition was pending before the assembly. He said the governor’s order would make the motion infructuous, undermining the right of the members against the chief minister.  
Barrister Zafar pointed out that the chief minister did not avoid taking a vote of confidence, as the speaker was supposed to summon a session for the purpose. The rules required the governor to allow a reasonable request to the CM to seek a vote of trust from the house. However, he said, his client was asked to do so within two days.  
Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh asked the counsel whether the grievance of the petitioner would stand addressed if a reasonable time was given for a vote of confidence. 
Barrister Zafar said the governor was not competent to fix a time and date for a session on a vote of confidence, as it was the jurisdiction of the speaker. 
“The petitioner’s only grievance is why he is being punished for a conflict between two other parties — the governor and speaker,” the counsel explained.  
Justice Sheikh noted to the counsel that if the petitioner was restored to his office by the court he would probably dissolve the assembly and the petition in hand would also stand infructuous, causing a crisis in the province. He asked the counsel whether his client was ready to submit a written undertaking that the assembly would not be dissolved if the governor’s notification was suspended.  
The bench allowed the counsel to consult his client on this point when he showed reluctance to tender any such undertaking. It observed that the interim relief sought by the petitioner was not possible without an assurance regarding dissolution of the assembly.  
The bench resumed hearing after an hour’s break with Elahi’s counsel submitting a written undertaking that the assembly would not be dissolved if the court suspended the impugned notification of the governor.  
PML-Q leader and Parvez Elahi’s son Moonis was also present in the court. 
The undertaking filed by the chief minister stated that if the governor’s order was suspended and the CM and his cabinet restored, he would not advise the governor to dissolve the assembly till the next date of hearing. 
Advocate Khalid Ishaq appeared on behalf of the governor and told the bench that Mr Rehman was ready to withdraw the impugned notification if the CM undertook to seek a vote of trust from the house within three to seven days. He also submitted that the petitioner should also undertake he would not dissolve the assembly within this period. 
However, the bench observed that the court could not restrain the CM from dissolving the assembly. “We have to maintain a balance between both parties,” the bench observed.  
After going through Elahi’s undertaking, the bench suspended the governor’s impugned notification and restored the CM and his cabinet till the next hearing of the case. It also issued notices to the attorney general for Pakistan and the advocate general of Punjab for their assistance on the questions raised in the petition. 
The bench would resume its hearing after winter vacation on Jan 11. It also said its order would not preclude the petitioner from taking a vote of confidence on his own.  
Earlier in the day, the full bench had dissolved due to recusal by one of its members. Later, the chief justice reconstituted the bench by replacing Justice Farooq Haider with Justice Asim Hafeez. 
PA to be dissolved 
After the court’s reprieve, Parvez Elahi was still adamant the decision to dissolve the assembly was final.  
“PTI chief Imran Khan’s decision in this regard will be fully implemented. The imported government wants to run away from elections. We will present the imported government in the people’s court who make the final decision,” the reinstated CM tweeted.  
Both Moonis and PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry also stressed the same. “We respect the judiciary. However, Mr Elahi will obtain a vote of confidence from the assembly and subsequently dissolve it the same day,” Moonis told reporters outside the LHC. 
No-trust motion withdrawn 
Earlier in the day, the main opposition parties in Punjab — PML-N and PPP — withdrew their no-confidence motion against CM Elahi. In their request to the Punjab Assembly speaker, the opposition lawmakers said: “As a consequence of the governor’s order, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi has ceased to be the chief minister of Punjab. Therefore, no further processing in pursuance of the subject notice dated Dec 19 is warranted. Thus, we withdraw the subject notice (submitting a no-trust motion to the CM) for having become infructuous.”  
When the Punjab governor had ordered CM Elahi to obtain a vote of confidence last Wednesday, the PML-N and PPP MPAs had subsequently submitted a no-trust resolution against him in a bid to bar him from dissolving the assembly. 
Under the law, a CM could not dissolve the assembly if a no-confidence motion had been moved against him. 
“CM Elahi has got temporary relief but eventually he will have to take a vote of confidence from the Punjab Assembly… and that will be his real test,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah told a private TV channel.  
Meanwhile, PML-N MPAs met at the Governor House on Friday before they joined the Punjab Assembly session. They were told by party leaders to ‘brace’ themselves for a change in Punjab.  
MPA Rana Mashhood said the federal coalition did not want dissolution of either assembly because it wanted economic stability in the country. 
“We have three options — option ‘A’ (seeking a vote of confidence from the CM) has been used and we will wait and see its outcome,” he commented. 
Chance to woo ruling lawmakers 
While all previous efforts of PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari to coax Mr Elahi, and PTI and PML-Q lawmakers have not borne any fruit, the opposition in Punjab believes the reinstatement of the chief minister has given it some more time to try its luck.   
“Mr Zardari, Chaudhry Shujaat and ‘some others’ have resumed their efforts to poach some birds from the PTI and PML-Q camps so that in case CM Elahi takes a trust vote they can stay away from the proceedings,” a PML-N leader from Punjab told Dawn on Friday.  
“Although Mr Zardari failed in the ‘first round’, it is hoped that the PPP leader with the help of those who matter springs up a surprise,” he said.

1,"Cop martyred, six injured in Islamabad suicide blast",TTP claims responsibility for capital’s first attack in years,"ISLAMABAD: A policeman was martyred and at least six people, including four police officers and two civilians, were injured in a suicide blast in Islamabad’s I-10/4 sector on Friday, the police said.
Television footage showed the fiery wreckage of a vehicle with several cops at the scene after the explosion. Shortly afterwards, the Islamabad police declared a “red alert” in the city, which saw the first such attack in years. 
The outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which called off a stop-start ceasefire with the government in November, claimed responsibility for the blast in a statement, according to AFP and Reuters news agencies.
The police earlier said the car used in the blast was occupied by a male driver and a woman passenger when he detonated a device inside the car.

TTP claims responsibility for capital’s first attack in years

However, details that emerged later suggested that the other person was also a man, and made the police unsure about his status that whether he was the accomplice of the suicide attacker or his hostage, Dawn has learnt.
A case has been registered at the Counterterrorism Department (CTD) Police Station against the person who detonated the explosive under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, sections 4 and 5 of the Explosives Act, along with sections 302, 324, 427 and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Police officials told Dawn footage revealed that the car had only one occupant, who was driving it. However, body parts of two people were found on the spot, including the suicide attacker.
There was confusion over the status of the other man who was driving the car that whether he was an accomplice of the terrorist, a hostage, or a driver who picked up a passenger as routine, the officials said.
However, they said that unlike details coming out immediately after the incident, there was no trace of any woman in the car or as an accomplice of the terrorists. Besides, the autopsy report also confirmed that there was no woman among the dead.
There were some general alerts over terrorism, but none of them was specific, the officials said.
The car, a Mehran yellow cab, was registered in Lahore in the name of a man who hails from Chakwal, they said, adding that the car was used with the original registration plate, and so far no report of the vehicle’s missing or stolen was found.
Usually, stolen vehicles or ones with fake a registration plate were used in crime and terrorism incidents, they said, adding that under such circumstances, there was a possibility that the other person was a hostage of the terrorist, who hired the taxi until reaching his destination, or used the taxi as a normal passenger.
The taxi entered from the capital from Pirwahdi and reached Sabzi Mandi and later moved to Islamabad’s I-10/4 sector via service road. A police patrolling team signalled the taxi to stop on suspicion and the driver disembarked from it and his search was conducted.
When the police team asked him for documents, including the CNIC, he returned to the taxi and all of sudden, it blew up with the explosion when he reached the rear door, the officers said, adding that the circumstances and evidence collected from the spot suggested that either he or the man sitting in the car detonated the suicide jacket kept at the rear seat of the taxi.
Besides, it was also believed that the other person was lying on the rear seat, they said, but added that so far nothing was established and confirmed about who was the taxi driver and who was the terrorist.
The explosion turned the taxi into the wreckage, and 12kg to 15kg explosives were used in the explosion, the police said.
Documents of two vehicles, including the taxi and CNICs, were also found from the spot, the officials said.
In the explosion, Head Constable Syed Adeel Hussain, 46, was martyred. Besides, five policemen — M. Yousaf, Mehboob, Naveed, Haneef, and Raza Hassan — along with two civilians, M. Ashar and Inam, were injured.
The interior minister and a senior police officer claimed the presence of a woman terrorist in the car, but evidence or clue regarding his presence was not established, the officials added.
In an interview with Geo News, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said “two terrorists” were killed in the blast.
“The vehicle used in the blast was registered in Chakwal. The car entered Islamabad from Rawalpindi […] it was packed with explosives and headed for a high-value target in the capital,” he said, adding that if the car had reached its target, it would have caused heavy losses.
Deputy Inspector General of Police Operations Sohail Zafar Chattha also said that a taxi in which a man and woman was riding was intercepted on suspicion and conducted their body search, during which a man with long hair returned to the car and blew himself up.
Hours later, the police registered an FIR, which slightly contradicted with DIG Chattha’s statement, as it said that the police team stopped the taxi on suspicion. The head constable came close to the taxi and on his demand the driver, produced CNIC and vehicle registration book to him, it added.
The head constable spotted a long-haired man, who seemed to be of Afghan origin from appearance and seated on the rear seat, the FIR said. When the cop asked his colleagues to check the passenger, the explosion occurred.

2,PM assuages allies’ concerns over Reko Diq,PM assures JUI-F leaders that he has formed a cabinet committee to address their grievances.,"ISLAMABAD: All grievances being expressed by some parties in the ruling coalition over the recent legislation about the Reko Diq copper and gold project will be addressed.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held out this assurance during a meeting with Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) chief and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-F emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Friday.
Two components of the ruling PDM coalition — JUI-F and Balochistan Nat­ional Party-Mengal — have shown displeasure over the bill recently passed by the National Assembly regarding the Reko Diq project. 
Leaders of these parties, who are members of the federal cabinet, even left a recent cabinet meeting to record their protest.
According to the Prime Minister Office, Maulana Fazl called on the prime minister along with a delegation that included Minister for Communication Asad Mehmood.
Current political situation, particularly the ongoing political war in Punjab, also came under discussion during the meeting.
A source told Dawn the prime minister apprised the JUI-F leaders that he had formed a cabinet committee to resolve their grievances and that an amendment bill would soon be tabled in parliament in consultation with them.
The JUI-F was of the view that the Reko Diq-related Foreign Investment (Promotion and Protection) Bill, 2022, recently passed by the Senate, was against the rights of the people of Balochistan and that the two parties had not been taken on board when the bill was drafted.
According to the source, PM Sheh­baz reiterated the PDM government’s stance that general elections would be held on their scheduled time next year. The issue of rising inflation was also discussed.
Export of IT products
Presiding over a meeting aimed at promoting export of Information Technology products, the prime minister noted that Pakistani people had immense talent and skills pertaining to information technology and emphasised the need for a comprehensive strategy to increase the export of IT-related products on priority.
The PM directed the ministers and officials concerned to resolve the problems faced by the exporters of IT products. He also called for improving contacts between the universities and academia and the IT industries.
The meeting was informed that last year, Pakistan’s IT-related exports touched $2.6 billion, while efforts were afoot to increase the volume to $5bn in the next five years. The largest chunk of IT products was being exported to the United States.
The meeting was informed that the country had the second biggest freelance workforce in the world and steps were being taken to use it. Also, the launch of a two-year associate degree programme in IT is under consideration to encourage the young generation to join the field.
It was highlighted that the promotion of artificial intelligence, cyber technology, and chain and cloud technology was the priority of the government. The brand of Tech Destination is being promoted at the international level.
The meeting was told that Federal Board of Revenue had established help desks in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad to facilitate the IT exporters. The desks are working at the level of Commissioner Inland Revenue.
Housing for expats
Prime Minister Sharif directed the authorities concerned to ensure early construction of modern housing units in the federal capital for overseas Pakistanis.
At a meeting held to review progress on the construction of residential units of international standards for expatriates, he said provision of modern housing facilities for overseas Pakistanis was among the government’s priorities.
He said construction firms of international fame should be engaged for such projects.
The prime minister said overseas Pakistanis were a valuable asset for the country and the protection of their rights would be ensured.
Kazakhstan deputy PM
During a meeting with a delegation from Kazakhstan led by Deputy Prime Minister Serik Zhumangarin, PM Shehbaz said the signing of three MoUs on aviation, investment and banking cooperation between the two countries would not only enhance trade and economic relations but also spur people-to-people contacts.
He welcomed the delegation which has arrived to attend the 11th session of the Intergovernmental Joint Commission (IJC).
The prime minister appreciated the decisions agreed reached at the IJC session and expressed satisfaction on concurrent holding of the Joint Business Council which brought businessmen from both countries together.

3,Bill to ‘delay’ capital LG polls passed amid uproar,"ISLAMABAD: Amid up­roar by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), a controversial bill meant to delay local elections...","ISLAMABAD: Amid up­roar by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), a controversial bill meant to delay local elections in the federal capital sailed through the Senate on Friday in a brief session, which was convened on a very short notice of less than an hour, just a day after the National Assembly had adopted it.
The main agenda item — ‘situation arising out of recent wave of terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa along with overall law and order situation in the country’ — was not taken up at all, as the only business transacted by the upper house of parliament was the introduction and passage of the Islamabad capital territory local government amendment bill brought through supplementary agenda.
The bill, which was not even sent to relevant standing committee as per standard practice, was passed though the opposition repeatedly pointed out to Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani that the number of members in the house was too small to constitute a quorum. 
With this legislation, the number of union councils in Islamabad has been increased to 125 from 101 and there will be direct election of mayor and deputy mayor.
At the outset, before the introduction of bill by Minister of State for Law Shahadat Awan, Leader of the Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem raised an objection to the way the session was summoned and pointed out that even members were not properly informed. “What was the urgency to summon the session?” he asked the chair.
When the opposition leader called for putting an end to the practice of ambushing the parliament, the Mr Sanjrani said the house was summoned on a requisition of treasury benches, triggering a noisy protest by members belonging to the PTI. Chanting slogans against the coalition government, they assembled near the chairman’s podium and tore apart copies of the agenda, which also included the recent wave of terrorism and overall law and order in the country. Subsequently, the security staff of the senate secretariat gathered in the main passage, dividing the treasury and the opposition benches to prevent any clash.
Quorum 
Raising slogans such as “Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) ran away” and “Don’t run away from elections”, the PTI senators raised the issue of quorum. However, they were asked by Mr Sanjrani that only from their seats, they can point out the issue of quorum.
The PTI members, except Faisal Javed, who later pointed out the quorum went out of the house for a few minutes, with the result that the count found only 22 of the 100 members present in the house and the chairman declared the house was not in order. Interestingly, quorum bells were rung for three minutes and the chair finally declared the house in order though he admitted 24 members were present whereas a quorum comprises at least 25 members.
While Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman pointed out that the session was requisitioned to discuss law and order and requested the chair to take up government bills, Mr Sanjrani asked the treasury benches to first move the Islamabad local government amendment bill, which was then passed by a majority vote of 24-12. However, when the chairman asked the opposition, after the passage of the bill, if they wanted to discuss the motion on law and order, no one responded amid the noisy protest.
At this, Senator Rehman said the opposition PTI was not interested in discussing rising terrorism in the country, adding that it must be looked into who was conspiring against Pakistan and who was steering it out of problems. 
Mr Sanjrani prorogued the house sine die as the PTI lawmakers continued their protest and slogans chiding the PDM government for attempts to avoid local polls, which were only a week away, in Islamabad.
Reaction
Hours later, ex-senator Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar tweeted that the [PDM] is so afraid of the reaction of the masses that they hurriedly and without even a quorum amended the law to delay the local elections in Islamabad. “If this is the condition of the government that ends at Faizabad, what will be its fate in rest of the country,” he wrote.
“The amendment bill in Senate session despite strong protest by the opposition in a hurry [is] another attempt of the PDM government to avoid elections,” the PTI stated on its official Twitter handle. “Running away from elections is PDM’s defeat confession. The PDM might now have a majority in parliament, but PTI is [popular] in every street and neighbourhood,” it added.

4,"Situationer: Amid TTP escalation, Kabul’s rulers insist group ‘not using Afghan soil’",Afghan govt spokesman says Pakistan needs to work on the causes that lead to instability in the country.,"WHILE Islamabad looks to Kabul to rein in the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Afghan Taliban regime is adamant that the group is not operating out of Afghanistan and, as such, their attacks on Pakistani soil are an internal issue that Pakistan must deal with itself.
When the Afghan Taliban seized Kabul in Aug 2021, their willingness to engage with Pakistan was taken as a silver lining, and there was a high degree of optimism that they would use their influence on the TTP and help Pakistan restore order in the bordering province, more so in the troubled tribal districts.
The new rulers of Kabul initially offered to facilitate talks between Islamabad and the TTP leadership in Kabul, and several rounds of overt and covert meetings were held.
But statistics show that what has transpired has been contrary to expectations; the number of casualties — including police, civilians and other law enforcement officials — has more than doubled in the period since the Ashraf Ghani regime was ousted.
The TTP, which took shelter in Afghanistan following a military operation in 2014, have been sporadically carrying out attacks across Pakistan ever since, but their activities were mostly focused in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The militant group saw a resurgence in the second half of 2021, but that was before negotiations began under the auspices of the Islamic Emirate to end hostilities.
The group’s attacks, however, continued even after they agreed to an indefinite ceasefire, saying those attacks were either defensive or retaliatory in nature.
 
 

There has, however, been a dramatic escalation since the banned group announced an end to the ceasefire on Nov 28, 2022, with target killings, suicide bombings and the like becoming a near-daily occurrence once again.
Official statistics show that the number of attacks by militant groups in KP under the Ghani regime (Jan 2021 to Nov 2021) was 218, but this figure almost doubled, reaching 420 in the time since the Afghan Taliban seized power in Kabul.
In the same period, civilian casualties (including the dead and injured) rose by a staggering 169 per cent, while police casualties registered a 43.7pc rise.
According to official statistics, there were a total of 189 attacks against the KP police between Jan 1, 2022 and Dec 23, 2022. Of these, 148 were carried out by the TTP and its various affiliates alone.
Again, out of the 98 policemen killed in militant attacks until Dec 23, TTP has been responsible for at least 84 of the deaths.
The Pakistan branch of the militant Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K) group was behind 33 attacks that resulted in the death of 12 policemen.
Both groups are believed to be based in Afghanistan with sleeper cells operating across the country. However, it has been Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that has borne the brunt of their attacks, with the bloodiest occurring in Mar 2022, when IS-K claimed a bombing at a Shia mosque in Peshawar.
 
 

In recent days, the tribal districts of Bajaur, North and South Waziristan have been the worst hit. Due to its proximity to Waziristan, the southern district of Lakki Marwat has also seen a spike in militant attacks lately.
In the past three months alone, the TTP has claimed at least 141 attacks: 39 in September, 43 in October and 59 in November.
‘Not in Afghanistan’
While there is growing fear and anxiety in civil society circles over the return of militancy and violence after years of peace in much of the province, both the Afghan Taliban and the TTP are claiming that the attacks happening inside Pakistan have no links with Afghanistan.
Although they have been echoing the mantra that Islamabad wants to hear, i.e. Afghan soil should not be used against Pakistan, for several months, the Afghan Taliban are now saying that the TTP leadership is not in Afghanistan.
“This is our principled stand and our strategic policy. We shall never permit anyone use Afghan soil against Pakistan.”, Zabihullah Mujahid, spokesperson of the Afghan government told Dawn.
“We don’t want instability in Pakistan… we want peace and stability [there],” he said, but insisted that the impression that the TTP leadership is in Afghanistan was incorrect.
 
 

“Some of their representatives might have come for the negotiations with the Pakistani government. They are not here, nor are they allowed to stay here,” he maintained.
Pakistan, he said, needed to work on the causes that leads to instability in the country.
This stance now mirrors that of the outlawed TTP. In a statement issued on Dec 19, the banned group claimed that a “vast portion of the tribal areas is under our occupation, where a large number of mujahideen are present along with their leadership. There is no need for us to use the soil of Afghanistan.”
Even during the latest episode at the Bannu counterterrorism centre, when the hostage-takers sought safe passage to Afghanistan, the TTP was quick to make corrections.
It said that the militants inside the compound, having been “incarcerated for years”, did not have a full understanding of the situation and had erroneously mentioned Afghanistan.
In the past three months alone, the TTP has claimed 39 attacks in September, 43 in October and 59 in November. But lately, they have taken to insisting that all these attacks are being launched from inside Pakistan.
Leaning on Kabul
Even before the Taliban took over, Pakistan had been pressing the previous administration in Kabul to take action against the TTP and other groups, and had blamed Afghan and Indian intelligence agencies for fomenting trouble in the province bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistani officials familiar with the situation say that since the National Security Committee meeting that was called to discuss the negotiations with the TTP in July, no formal meeting has been convened to take stock of the deteriorating security situation in KP, despite calls from parties across the political spectrum.
There are some indications that after the initial ambivalence and policy confusion post-TTP negotiations, the security apparatus has been given some sort of green light to go on the offensive, particularly after the change of command at General Headquarters.
However, clear policy guidelines on internal security and the future of talks with the TTP are still awaited.
There is also a view in official circles that it is time to speak directly to the interim regime in Afghanistan, instead of the TTP. While there is a mechanism to discuss this and other cross-border issues – such as the violent flare-ups at the Chaman border – at the level of joint coordination committees, there has been little headway on any of these fronts.
