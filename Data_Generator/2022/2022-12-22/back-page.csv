0,Iranian FM confirms ‘friendly’ talks with Saudi counterpart,Claims Prince Faisal assured of Riyadh’s willingness to continue dialogue with Tehran.,"DUBAI: Iran’s foreign minister said on Wednesday he spoke with his Saudi counterpart on the sidelines of a conference in Jordan the previous day, the highest-level encounter reported between officials from the rival states since they cut ties in 2016.
The Middle East’s leading Shia and Sunni Muslim powers — Saudi Arabia and Iran — have been on opposing sides of conflicts across the region, including in Syria and Yemen.
Iraq has hosted five meetings between Saudi and Iranian officials since last year in a bid to ease tensions, the last of which was in April, without achieving any diplomatic breakthrough.
Iranian Foreign Min­ister Hossein Amira­bdollahian, tweeting in Arabic, on Wednesday listed his Saudi counterpart, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, as one of several foreign ministers with whom he had the chance to hold “friendly talks” on the sidelines of the Jordan conference. He said he also spoke with the foreign ministers of Oman, Qatar, Iraq and Kuwait.

Claims Prince Faisal assured of Riyadh’s willingness to continue dialogue with Tehran

The Saudi foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Amirabdollahian wrote that Prince Faisal “assured me of his country’s willingness to continue the dialogue with Iran”.
In separate comments reported by Iran’s official IRNA news agency, Amirabdollahian said he had “announced our readiness to continue the process that started in Baghdad”. “We are interested in resuming talks with Saudi Arabia and they also wanted it,” he said, according to IRNA.

Tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia have ticked higher since the eruption of protests in Iran, with the Revolutionary Guards telling Saudi Arabia to control its media and the Iranian intelligence minister warning Riyadh there was no guarantee of Tehran continuing its “strategic patience”.
Iran has accused its foreign foes of fomenting the protests, in which Iranians from all walks have life have taken part.
A top general in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, Esmail Ghaani, on Tuesday referred to Saudi Arabia — a long-standing ally of the United States — as “a scum and not worthy of being an enemy”.
Iran’s disputed nuclear programme has also added to tensions, with talks between Tehran and world powers on reviving Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement at a standstill since September.
Prince Faisal said earlier in December that the signs were “not very positive unfortunately”, and that Gulf Arab states would act to shore up their security if Iran were to obtain nuclear weapons, which Tehran says it is not seeking.
The meeting in Jordan, organised by France and Iraq and aimed at supporting stability in Iraq and the wider region, wrapped up on Tuesday with no word of a bilateral meeting between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

1,FIA court rejects Swati’s post-arrest bail,ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of...,"ISLAMABAD: A special court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Wednesday rejected the post-arrest bail of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Senator Azam Khan Swati in a case registered against him over anti-establishment tweets.
Special Judge (Central) Azam Khan observed that Senator Swati had repeated the same crime in which he was already on a post-arrest bail.
During the course of the hearing, FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi argued that Mr Swati operated a verified Twitter account and he was being followed by politicians, journalists and the public at large. He said Mr Swati never contested the ownership of his Twitter handle and used it to build an anti-army narrative.
Mr Abbasi claimed this was a deliberate attempt to incite mutiny among personnel of the armed forces. He said the PTI leader misused the relief of bail and tweeted the same text for which he was facing a case before the FIA’s Cybercrimes Wing.
Mr Swati’s counsel Babar Awan argued that the complainant, who had lodged the first information report (FIR) against his client, was not an aggrieved party.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it was not on a par with the complaint filed under defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court could impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Mr Swati over his tweet, but he was being moved from one province to another.
The FIA had earlier this month arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets, after his fiery speech at a PTI long march in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at the senior military leadership.

3,‘TTP is Pakistan’s absolute red line’,Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security.,"WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has suggested letting neighbouring countries know that the outlawed TTP is an “absolute red line” for Pakistan and it would not allow anyone to cross that line.
“As far as the TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) is concerned, it’s absolutely our red line. It is something that we will not tolerate,” said the foreign minister while speaking at the Atlantic Council, Washington, on Tuesday evening. 
“And absolutely we will be willing to consider each and every single option to ensure the safety and security of our people.” 

 





 
As the foreign minister stressed the need for combating militants in his Washington talk, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Munir Akram told the UN Security Council in New York that engagement with the Taliban was the best option to stabilise the region.
“Coercion and isolation have not proved successful in the past; they will prove to be counter-productive now and in the future,” said Ambassador Akram while participating in a UN debate on the situation in Afghanistan. “We need a coherent and practical plan to realise the objectives of the international community through patient engagement with the interim government,” the Pakistani envoy told the 15-member Council.

Bilawal says Islamabad willing to consider all options to ensure citizens’ safety and security

Mr Bhutto-Zardari made a similar observation in his talk at the Atlantic Council, urging world powers to work with Afghanistan’s de facto rulers to stabilise the region. When the moderator, Uzair Younus, asked if Pakistan could deploy troops inside Afghanistan or on the border to stop attacks by Afghanistan-based militant groups, the minister suggested using the “hammer and anvil” strategy, with Kabul’s cooperation, to eliminate militancy.
The chief Pakistani diplomat pointed out that despite these border and cross-border attacks, the situation was far more secure and stable now than it was in 2007, when Pakistan launched a series of operations against the TTP and other militants.
“But those things can be put at risk if this goes unchecked. And obviously that would undermine any hope, whether it is CPEC or any other form of economic activity. Nobody wants to put lives at risk in order to conduct business,” he warned.
“That’s why I have been particularly hawkish on the issue of the TTP, and on the issue of terrorism in general. I believe that recent events in the region are alarming, not only the border incidents but the recent Bannu incident, which our security commanders have very bravely managed to overcome,” he said.
The foreign minister, however, stressed the need to “impress on our neighbours, particularly Afghan­istan” that they have to demonstrate the will and the capacity to take on the TTP or other groups functioning from there.
He acknowledged that there’s room for improvement in Pakistan’s Afghan policy — as there’s in America’s — and “we need to be serious about what we can do going forward”.
“Are we going learn from our mistakes to ensure that we do not repeat them,” he asked. “The answer to that question is going to define the safety and stability of Afghanistan, the safety and stability of Pakistan and the safety and stability of our region.” 
Pakistan’s number one option, he said, was to get the Afghan interim government to demonstrate that they had the capacity to deal with this issue.
Separately, the foreign minister also met Deputy Secretary of State Wendy R. Sherman where they discussed Pakistan’s efforts to recover from devastating floods and the upcoming Jan 9 International Con­ference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva. 
According to a readout issued by the State Department, the US official expressed condolences for Pakistani lives lost in recent terrorist attacks, and they committed to strengthen cooperation between the two countries.
