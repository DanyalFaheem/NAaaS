0,Funds raised on PSX drop to nine-year low,"Companies are lacking interest in raising funds through stock market due to “political and economic instability,” report says.","KARACHI: The amount of fresh capital raised on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in 2022 dropped to a nine-year low, a research report compiled by brokerage house Topline Securities Ltd showed on Thursday.
The lack of interest among companies in raising funds through the stock market was because of “political and economic instability,” it said.
Companies raised Rs1.3 billion in three initial public offerings (IPOs) in the outgoing year. This was in sharp contrast to 2021 in which companies raised fresh capital of Rs20bn in as many as eight offerings.
The number of IPOs in 2022 was the lowest since 2019 when only one company went public.
The poor showing in terms of new listings was in line with the overall stock market performance in the outgoing year. The benchmark index, which reflects the cumulative performance of top 100 shares on the bourse, has dropped around 11 per cent since the beginning of 2022.
In dollar terms, market capitalisation or the collective value of the same 100 firms has shrunk by about 30pc over the same period.
The volume of shares traded on a daily basis slipped 52pc from the preceding year to 231 million. The annual decline in terms of the average value of shares traded every day has been 60pc to Rs7bn.
Adamjee Life Assurance Company Ltd and Global Residency REIT raised Rs700m and Rs140m, respectively, on the PSX’s mainboard. 
Supernet Ltd generated Rs475m on the sideboard through big-ticket investors only.

2,ECC defers PSO’s request for Rs17bn,Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn.,"ISLAMABAD: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet was informed on Wednesday that receivables of the national fuel supplier – Pakistan State Oil (PSO) had crossed Rs612 billion and it was struggling to manage remittances to its foreign suppliers.
The meeting of the ECC presided over by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, however, did not immediately approve Rs17bn urgently demanded by the PSO to honour its liabilities to international firms, particularly its long-term fuel supplier Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC).
“The ECC deferred a summary submitted by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) for foreign exchange coverage to PSO and directed the Ministry of Energy to resubmit the summary after reviewing the numbers”, said an official statement.
The Petroleum Division reported that under a credit facility provided by KPC since 2000 and extended annually for the supply of diesel, a joint account of the federal government and KPC had been set up with the National Bank of Pakistan in which PSO keeps on depositing rupee equivalent funds after 30 days of the bill of lading for each shipment.
After 90 days from the bill of lading, the NBP has to transfer the cargo cost to KPC and exchange cover for an additional 60 days is borne by the federal government.
However, the account facility started to face huge shortfalls in April 2020 on account of exchange losses, posing a default situation in remittances to KPC.
At the time the ECC approved a supplementary grant of Rs12bn which helped PSO avoid an international default. The facility worked well for another two years but then suffered a shortfall again and now this shortfall stood at Rs17bn owing to “prevalent upheaval” in the rupee-dollar parity.

Receivables of embattled national fuel supplier cross Rs612bn

The Petroleum Division said the PSO had been defaulting even on rupee deposits in the NBP account because of its liquidity challenges as its receivables reached Rs612bn and “it urgently required adequate funds so that liabilities are met on time”. 
The Petroleum Division and PSO have been trying to manage the situation for avoiding international default by depositing required funds on due dates but the situation was “too critical” now.
It also complained that the Petroleum Division had been submitting budget requirements for exchange loss on this facility every year but the Ministry of Finance did not make separate provisions which led to exposure to international default.
The finance ministry, however, argued that the government had already released Rs30bn to address PSO’s liquidity position under the foreign exchange head in September and arranged another Rs50bn through market financing. Also, the government was now trying to ensure PSO recoveries through power companies and gas companies.
The Petroleum Division, however, insisted that the matter related to actual foreign exchange loss of over Rs17bn so far on the KPC’s credit facility up to Dec 2, which has to be paid by the government sooner or later.
“PSO has made all outstanding payments delayed due to liquidity position. Exchange loss, however, is the liability of the government”, Petroleum Division was quoted but a decision was deferred.
Supplementary grants
The ECC approved a summary of the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) on the transfer of 30pc working interests in exploration licences/block – Margala Block – owned by M/s MOL of Hungary to M/s Mari Petroleum Company Ltd. 
It was apprised that Margala Block was governed by Pakistan Petroleum Exploration and Production Rules 2001 and the acquiring company MPCL was operating in Pakistan since 1954 and has working interests in 23 exploration licences and 15 development & production leases. The ECC was further informed that M/s MOL had cleared all its financial obligations.
The ECC also approved a Rs823m technical supplementary grant to the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, enabling Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to disburse the amount of Rs250,000 per head to 3,291 fishermen registered with Balochistan Fisheries Department for the purchase of boat engines.
The ECC also approved another Rs200mn Technical Supplementary Grant to the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulation and Coordination for Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH), Lahore. Ghurki Trust Teaching Hospital (GTTH) is a tertiary care non-profit organisation providing “State of the Art” health facilities to needy and poor patients.

3,"China willing to provide ‘all kinds of assistance’, envoy assures Dar","Both sides deliberate on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors.","ISLAMABAD: China assured Pakistan on Wednesday that it is ready to help Islamabad in every possible way following its request for about $8.75 billion in an additional financial package, including the rollover of debt, bank deposits and currency swaps.
Chinese Ambassador in Islamabad Nong Rong called on Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday and “assured continuous support of the Chinese government to Pakistan”, the finance ministry said in a statement.
The “government of China stands with the people of Pakistan and is willing to provide all kinds of assistance”, the statement added.
Mr Dar told reporters last month that Pakistan had sought about $9bn in additional financial support from China during the visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Beijing, and that the Chinese leadership had promised to “roll over $4bn in sovereign loans, refinance $3.3bn commercial bank loans and increase currency swap by about $1.45bn — from 30bn yuan to 40bn yuan”. The total worked out at $8.75bn.
Pakistan needs at least $34bn until June 30, 2023, to meet its international liabilities, including debt and trade payments. Pakistan is banking on about $13bn in additional support from China and Saudi Arabia.
The statement said Mr Dar “thanked the Chinese ambassador for their continuous support and assistance” and praised the long-standing and deep-rooted friendly relations between the two countries.
Both sides deliberated on several avenues for expanding bilateral relations, especially in the economic and financial sectors. The ambassador appreciated the government’s policy initiatives to sustain and boost fiscal and monetary stability.
Mr Dar had earlier said that the Chinese president and prime minister had assured Prime Minister Sharif that his government would stand by Pakistan and “will not let you down”.
He had then separately taken up the issue of refinancing $3bn in China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) deposit and about $3.3bn debt rollover. Both these heads are due for maturity on different dates before June 30.

4,Red tape hampering small hydro projects,Sponsors of small hydropower projects complain to the PM over obstacles in the development of renewable domestic resources.,"ISLAMABAD: The sponsors of small hydropower projects under 50 megawatts generation capacity have complained to the prime minister over the bureaucratic red tape hampering the development of renewable domestic resources.
In a letter to the prime minister, Hydro Electric Power Association (Hepa) — a group of local sponsors — has also appealed to the prime minister to intervene in the matter and appoint a probe commission led by former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi who is also chairman task force on energy or Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal to find out causes for the inordinate institutional delays in the development of local resources despite supporting government policies in place and loss of foreign exchange on expensive imported fuels.
It demanded that the proposed commission should also engage with the sponsors of small hydropower projects and come out with an impartial conclusion over the whole situation based on which the government should move for a way out that was in the interest of the nation and consumers.
The association said the country’s energy needs were growing at around 8pc per annum and two major policy initiatives like access to private money and indigenous alternative energy such as solar, wind and hydro would play a key role.
However, it complained to the prime minister that the development of small hydropower projects (less than 50MW) was not encouraged by the bureaucratic federal government.

5,Tobacco demand grows to record 86m kilos,"“A tough competition to acquire tobacco is expected and officials of companies are approaching farmers,"" says official.","SWABI: The demand for tobacco has been set at a record 85.8 million kilograms for the next year, significantly higher than the current year’s 53.575m kg, leaf managers and growers told Dawn on Wednesday.
The high requirements, announced by the buyers through the Pakistan Tobacco Board (PTB), have sent officials of multinational and national tobacco companies scurrying around the fields to secure agreements with farmers, sometimes on the spot.
Tobacco demand from buyers was 45.6m kg in 2019 and 56.48m kg in 2021. Growers and company officials agreed that the next year’s demand of 85.8m kg was a record high.
The requirement for flue-cured Virginia (FCV) tobacco — used in cigarettes — is the highest at 82.7m kg, including 71.7m kg in the plain areas, 10m kg in sub-mountain regions and 1m kg in Punjab.
The demand for dark air-cured (DAC) tobacco, which is produced in Gujrat and Okara, is 1.7m kg. The requirement for sun-cured rustica tobacco (or white patta) is 565,000 kg and for light air-cured tobacco (burley) is 360,000 kg.
Of the total FCV demand, 37.5m kg is planned to be exported to different countries, leaving 48.3m kg to be purchased and utilised in cigarette making by multinational, national and small cigarette manufacturers in Pakistan.
A PTB official told Dawn that different companies, dealers and agents exported some 22.4m kg of tobacco during 2021-22 for over $77.3m and now expected more foreign exchange in the future.
A leaf manager, who wished not to be named, told Dawn that a few European countries considered Pakistan a cheap market for purchasing the crop and they had already nominated their agents who would purchase tobacco for them.
“A tough competition to acquire tobacco is expected and officials of companies have already started approaching farmers, even visiting them in their fields and issuing agreements on the spot,” he said.

6,FBR asked to maximise tax collection,Dar asks tax officials to collect maximum revenue to narrow the gap with IMF over annual tax collection projection.,"ISLAMABAD: At a time when billions of rupees in revenue from new tax measures are stuck in litigation, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday asked top tax officials to gear up efforts to collect maximum revenue to narrow the gap with International Monetary Fund over annual tax collection projection. 
Mr Dar held a meeting on revenue performance at FBR headquarters. 
Chairman Asim Ahmed briefed the minister and two special assistants to Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa and Tariq Pasha, who also served as former chairmen of the board in the last PML-N government. 
Four revenue measures especially the super tax introduced in the last budget, which involved a collection of Rs250 billion were challenged in courts by a few taxpayers and created problems for FBR in reaching its annual revenue target. As a result of litigation, taxpayers uphold tax payments under these heads. 
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn that Mr Dar has asked the FBR officials to gear up efforts to raise maximum revenue. No guideline or instruction came from the finance minister regarding any new tax measures, the source added. 
Mr Dar focus of direction was on administrative efforts to improve compliance, the source further added.

8,Stocks shed another 490 points on political unrest,KARACHI: Ongoing political unrest brought down share prices yet again on Wednesday as investors expected the bearish...,"KARACHI: Ongoing political unrest brought down share prices yet again on Wednesday as investors expected the bearish trend to continue on the stock exchange.
Topline Securities said bearish sentiments prevailed especially in the second half of the trading session as investors went on a selling spree that eroded earlier gains. The sell-off was in reaction to the tug of war between the PTI and other parties on the dissolution of the Punjab Assembly.

As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 39,342.89 points, down 489.56 points or 1.23 per cent from the preceding session.



 
The overall trading volume decreased 37.4pc to 166 million shares. The traded value went down 38.2pc to $17.9m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (17.4m shares), Hum Network Ltd (11.8m shares), Dewan Farooque Motor Company Ltd (8.5m shares), K-Electric Ltd (7.7m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (6.7m shares).
Sectors that contributed negatively to the index performance were commercial banking (159 points), technology and communication (106.4 points), fertiliser (71.2 points), exploration and production (52.2 points) and oil marketing (24.4 points).
Companies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs100), Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs45.50), Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs41.67), Khyber Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs17.33) and Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs11.24).
