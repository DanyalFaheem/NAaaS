0,First foreign Covid vaccines head to China from Germany,BERLIN: Berlin has sent its first batch of BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines to China to be administered initially to ...,"BERLIN: Berlin has sent its first batch of BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines to China to be administered initially to German expatriates, a German government spokesperson said on Wednesday, the first foreign coronavirus vaccine to be delivered to the country.
No other details were available on the timing and size of the delivery, although the spokesperson said Berlin is pushing for foreigners other than German citizens to be allowed access to the shot if they want it.
The shipment comes after China agreed to allow German nationals in China to get the shot following a deal during Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s visit in Beijing last month, with the German leader pressing for Beijing to allow the shot to be made freely available to Chinese citizens as well. There are about 20,000 German nationals currently in the country. “I can confirm a shipment of the BioNTech vaccine is on its way to China,” the person told journalists in Berlin.
“We are working on the possibility that besides Germans also other foreigners can be vaccinated with BioNTech.”  In return, Chinese citizens in Europe can be vaccinated with China’s SinoVac, the spokesperson said.
The comment comes after a report earlier this month that Germany’s health ministry had granted a permit allowing China’s Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine to be imported to Germany to be given to Chinese citizens in that country.
WHO chief ‘very concerned’
The WHO’s director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a briefing on Wednesday the UN agency is concerned by the spike in Covid-19 infections in the world’s No 2 economy. He said the WHO is supporting the government to focus its efforts on vaccinating people at the highest risk across the country.
China has nine domestically developed Covid vaccines approved for use, more than any other country. But none has been updated to target the highly infectious Omicron variant, as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna have for boosters in many developed countries.

1,Afghan women stopped from entering varsities; Taliban ban stuns students,UN mission in Afghanistan asks the Taliban-run administration to “immediately” revoke the decision.,"KABUL: Female university students in Afghanistan were turned away from campuses on Wednesday after the Taliban-run administration said women would be suspended from tertiary education.  
The decision to bar women was announced on Tuesday evening in a letter to universities from the higher education ministry, drawing condemnation from foreign governments and the United Nations.  
“We went to university, the Taliban were at the gate and told us ‘you are not allowed to enter the university until further notice’ ... everyone was crying,” said Shaista, a business studies student at a private university in Kabul.  
A professor at another university in Kabul who declined to be identified said staff turned female students away at the gate as they had no choice but to implement the instruction.  
The bar on women students is likely to complicate the Taliban administration’s efforts to gain international recognition and to get rid of sanctions that are severely hampering the economy. 
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan asked the Taliban-run administration to “immediately” revoke the decision. It also urged the authorities to reopen girls’ schools beyond the sixth grade and “end all measures preventing women and girls from participating fully in daily public life”.  
Third-year political science student Hassiba, based in Kabul, said she was studying for her exams when she heard about the announcement. “It’s too hard to accept, it’s unbelievable, I can’t believe it’s happening,” she said.  
“When there is no education for women in a society, how can we be hopeful for a bright future?”   Acco­rding to the late Tuesday announcement, the decision was made by the Taliban administration’s cabinet.  
Several Taliban officials, including the deputy foreign minister and administration spokesperson, have spoken out in favour of female education in recent months.  
The supreme Taliban spiritual leader, based in the southern city of Kandahar, has the final say on major decisions. Diplomatic and Taliban official sources have said the issue had been under discussion by the leadership.  
“This decision had been anticipated for weeks, prompting some Western officials to start talking about additional sanctions and further economic restrictions,” said Graeme Smith, senior consultant at International Crisis Group. “But the flood of outrage from the West will strengthen the resolve of the Taliban leadership, which defines itself as a bulwark against the outside world.”  
Taliban leadership said they want peaceful relations with the international community but that foreigners should not interfere in domestic affairs. 
Most girls are unable to go to school beyond primary classes. The Taliban administration has said it is working on a plan for girls’ secondary education but has not given a time frame. The administration made a surprise U-turn on signals it would open all high-schools for girls in March. 
Bilawal disappointed
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday showed disappointment  over the suspension of the university and higher education for women students in Afghanistan.
Taking to Twitter, Bilawal said Pakistan  strongly believe that every man and woman has the inherent right to  education in accordance with the injunctions of Islam. We strongly urge  the Afghan authorities to revisit this decision, said Bilawal.

2,Over 100 Rohingya stranded in boat off India’s coast,MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may...,"MUMBAI: At least 100 ethnic Rohingya are stranded in a boat off India’s Andaman Islands and as many as 16-20 may have have died of thirst, hunger or drowned, said two Myanmar Rohingya activist groups.
Each year many Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority, risk their lives boarding rickety vessels to escape violence in Myanmar and squalor in Bangladesh refugee camps. Many attempt to reach Malaysia.
The stranded boat was approached by five Indian ships late on Tuesday, a source said.
A spokesperson for the Indian Navy said he did not have any details to share. A spokesperson for the Coast Guard did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
“We estimate that probably as many as 20 have died some from hunger and thirst, and others jumped overboard in desperation. This is absolutely awful and outrageous,” said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project which works to support Myanmar’s Rohingyas.
Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group said the group had been adrift for more than two weeks.
“We heard late last night that there were some Indian vessels approaching the boat so we are awaiting updates now, said Lilianne Fan, chair of Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Networks Rohingya Working Group.
“We hope that the Indian Navy or Coastguard will manage to rescue and disembark the boat as soon as possible. These people have been adrift on a damaged boat for more than 2 weeks without food and water. We have heard that up to 16 people may have already died.”  Another boat, carrying more than a hundred Rohingya was rescued by Sri Lanka’s navy on the weekend.

3,Chicken tikka masala inventor dies aged 77,"Ahmed Aslam Ali, originally from Pakistan, moved with his family to Glasgow as a young boy before opening Shish Mahal there in 1964.","GLASGOW: A chef from Glasgow, who claims to have invented the curry dish chicken tikka masala, has died at the age of 77, a family member said on Wednesday.
Ahmed Aslam Ali, who invented the dish by improvising a sauce made from a tin of tomato soup at his restaurant Shish Mahal in the 1970s, died on Monday morning, his nephew Andleeb Ahmed said.
Ali, originally from Punjab, Pakistan, moved with his family to Glasgow as a young boy before opening Shish Mahal in Glasgow’s west end in 1964. 
He said he wanted the dish to be a gift to Glasgow, to give something back to his adopted city. In  2009, he campaigned unsuccessfully for the dish to be granted   “Protected Designation of Origin” status by the European Union,  alongside the likes of Champagne, Parma Ham and Greek Feta cheese.
MP Mohammad Sarwar tabled a motion in the House of Commons in 2009 calling for EU protection. Ali leaves a wife, three sons and two daughters.

4,Musk says ‘crazy’ cost cuts have saved Twitter,SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk on Wednesday said that severe cost cuts at Twitter had repaired the company’s dire...,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk on Wednesday said that severe cost cuts at Twitter had repaired the company’s dire finances as he set out to find a new CEO for his troubled social media platform.
The mercurial billionaire told a live chat forum that without the changes, including firing over half of Twitter’s employees, the company would have bled $3 billion dollars a year.
“Not good since Twitter has $1 billion in cash. That’s why I spent the past five weeks cutting costs like crazy,” he told Twitter Spaces, a feature of the platform he bought for $44 billion. “If... you’re looking at it from my standpoint... basically, you’re in a plane that is headed towards the ground at high speed with the engines on fire and the controls don’t work,” he said.
Just weeks into his ownership of Twitter, Musk fired about half of its 7,500-strong workforce, sparking concern that the company was insufficiently staffed to carry out content moderation and spooking governments and advertisers. Musk said that his strategy was paying off and that by massively reducing costs and building subscriber revenue,  “I now think that Twitter will in fact be OK next year” and break even.
He added that he understood that advertisers were skittish over spending on his platform, but blamed their caution on the souring economic outlook and not worries about content moderation. He said the new $8 subscription service called Twitter Blue would help make up the difference.Musk made the defence of his policies after he tweeted that he was on the hunt for a new CEO  “foolish” enough to replace him.

5,Nepal court orders release of serial killer Charles Sobhraj,"“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” says court.","KATHMANDU: Nepal’s top court ordered on Wednesday the release and deportation of Charles Sobhraj, the French serial killer portrayed in the Netflix series  “The Serpent” who was responsible for a string of murders across Asia in the 1970s.
The Supreme Court ruled Sobhraj, 78, who has been in prison in the Himalayan republic since 2003 for murdering two North American tourists, should be freed on health grounds.
“Keeping him in the prison continuously is not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” read a copy of the verdict.
“If there is not any other pending cases against him to keep him in the prison, this court orders his release by today and... the return to his country within 15 days.” Sobhraj needed open heart surgery and his release was in keeping with the law allowing the compassionate discharge of bedridden prisoners who had already served three-quarters of their sentence, the verdict added.
The notorious murderer underwent a five-hour cardiac operation in 2017 and the verdict said he remained in regular treatment for heart disease. Sobhraj will likely be freed from Kathmandu’s Central Jail on Thursday, an official at the prison said.
He will first have to appear in a lower court for administrative formalities before he can walk free, the official added.
Backpacker murders 
After a troubled childhood and several prison terms in France for petty crimes, Sobhraj began travelling the world in the early 1970s and wound up in the Thai capital Bangkok.
His modus operandi was to charm and befriend his victims — many of them starry-eyed Western backpackers on a quest for spirituality — before drugging, robbing and murdering them.
Suave and sophisticated, he was implicated in his first murder, that of a young American woman whose body was found on a beach in Pattaya wearing a bikini, in 1975. He was eventually linked to more than 20 killings.
His victims were strangled, beaten or burned, and he often used the passports of his male victims to travel to his next destination.
Sobhraj’s sobriquet,  “The Serpent”, came from his ability to assume other identities in order to evade justice. It became the title of a hit series made by the BBC and Netflix that was based on his life.
He was arrested in India in 1976 and ultimately spent 21 years in jail there, with a brief break in 1986 when he escaped and was caught again in the Indian coastal state of Goa.
Released in 1997, Sobhraj retired to Paris but resurfaced in 2003 in Nepal, where he was spotted in Kathmandu’s tourist district and arrested.
A court there handed him a life sentence the following year for killing US tourist Connie Jo Bronzich in 1975. A decade later he was also found guilty of killing Bronzich’s Canadian companion. In prison in 2008, Sobhraj married Nihita Biswas, who is 44 years his junior and the daughter of his Nepalese lawyer.

6,Rocket lost after liftoff in setback for Europe’s space ambitions,KOUROU: Europe’s new Vega-C rocket was lost shortly after lift-off from French Guiana overnight with two ...,"KOUROU: Europe’s new Vega-C rocket was lost shortly after lift-off from French Guiana overnight with two satellites on board, in the latest blow to European space efforts.
The launch failure on Tuesday night threatens to ground the Vega-C, which would leave Europe without a short-term way to send satellites into orbit after delays to the Ariane 6 rocket and cancelled Russian cooperation over the Ukraine war.
If it had been successful, it would have been the first commercial launch of the Vega-C since its inaugural flight on July 13.
But just minutes after lift-off on Wednesday, the launcher’s trajectory deviated from its programmed route and communications were lost, according to commercial launch service provider Arianespace.
“The mission is lost,” Arianespace chief executive Stephane Israel said from the Kourou Space Centre in French Guiana, a French department on South America’s northeast coast. An  “anomaly occurred” in the second stage of the launcher,  “ending the Vega-C mission”, the company said. The rocket was launched over the Atlantic Ocean and had shot past 100 kilometres altitude and was more than 900 kilometres north of Kourou.
It was not immediately clear whether the rocket’s destruction device was activated or whether it crashed into the sea. “Data analysis is under way to determine the reasons for this failure,” it added. A press briefing is scheduled for noon on Wednesday in Kourou.
Launches of Europe’s new Vega-C rocket will be suspended while an inquiry is held into what caused the failure of its first commercial flight overnight, French firm Arianespace said on Wednesday. 
Co-led by the European Space Agency and the French aerospace company, the “independent” commission, aims to find out “the cause of the failure and to propose robust and long-lasting corrective actions to guarantee a safe and reliable return to flight of Vega-C,” Arianespace chief executive Stephane Israel told a press conference.

7,"Zelensky on unannounced US visit, wins Biden’s support",Biden assures Zelensky of US support and expresses “admiration for resisting” Moscow.,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden welcomed Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky to the White House on an unannounced visit on Wednesday with renewed assurances of US support and “admiration for resisting” Moscow.
“Thank you first of all,” Zelensky told the US president.  “It’s a great honour to be here.” 
The meeting marks a high point in ties between Ukraine and its most important ally, putting the spotlight on a relationship strengthened by Russia’s invasion, but not without some friction along the way.
The visit, which is Zelensky’s first trip outside Ukraine since the war started in February, underscores the trust between the two countries with a White House meeting, a visit to Congress and a focus on more weapons for Kyiv.
It’s a relationship that hasn’t been without irritation, despite the strong military and diplomatic support that the United States has given to Ukraine since Russia invaded it on Feb 24.
“Friction is inevitable even between close allies in wartime,” said International Crisis Group UN Director Richard Gowan.
“The US and UK had huge rows over how to fight the Second World War. So I don’t think we should necessarily let day-to-day friction obscure how much help the US has given Ukraine,” Gowan said.
Tension between the two leaders has been on display at several key moments over the past year.
Most recently Biden disputed Zelensky’s comment that missiles which landed in Poland last month were not of Ukrainian origin, bluntly telling reporters: “That’s not the evidence.”  
And as the United States warned in January that Moscow was amassing tens of thousands of troops to invade, Zelensky accused Washington and the media of fuelling panic that weighed on the economy while there were “no tanks in the streets”.
A month later Russia invaded Ukraine.
Western powers have since stepped up to supply Ukraine with weapons and aid, taken in millions of refugees and inflicted severe sanctions on Russia. But Zelensky kept pushing for more, including a no-fly zone that was rejected in March by Nato.
“There was a Nato summit, a weak summit, a confused summit, a summit where it was clear that not everyone considers the battle for Europe’s freedom to be the number one goal,” Zelensky said at the time.
Then in June Zelensky praised Nato’s summit in Madrid, which paved the way for Finland and Sweden to join the alliance, but demanded more military support and an even tougher stance on Russia. 
“We need security guarantees, and you have to find a place for Ukraine in the common security space.”  
Nato membership for Ukraine has been a long-running and contentious question. Zelensky has pressed 
for the military alliance to admit his country into the group. Ukraine has a promise from Nato dating from 2009, when Biden was vice president under Barack Obama, that it would eventually be given the opportunity to join.
The alliance has yet to move forward on Ukraine’s application, however.

8,Ambulance workers walk out in strike-hit UK,Employees across the UK economy demand salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation.,"LONDON: Striking ambulance workers in England and Wales manned picket lines on Wednesday, escalating a pay dispute between the government and a host of public-sector staff.
A series of stoppages are causing misery across Britain in the run-up to Christmas, with railway workers and passport control officers set to hinder festive holiday getaways as the government resists the growing pay demands.
Employees across the UK economy are demanding salary rises to match or beat decades-high inflation — currently running at nearly 11 percent — which is spurring the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation.
“We’re not paid enough for what we deserve,” 24-year-old paramedic Kirsten Reid said in Crawley, southern England.  “Secondly, patient safety is a huge thing... our response times are shocking, and they need to be better.”  “We do 12-hour shifts with a 30-minute break, but they’re rarely ever 12-hour shifts. We’re usually overrun,” she added.
The government and unions continue to trade blame over the strikes amid fears of possible loss of life, as healthcare leaders warned about straining a system already in crisis.
On Tuesday, thousands of members of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland took to picket lines, five days after their first strike in its 106-year history.
Health Secretary Steve Barclay, writing in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, accused the unions of making a  “conscious decision” to  “inflict harm” on patients. GMB union national secretary, Rachel Harrison, hit back calling his comments  “insulting”.
“Ambulance workers are seething at such a crude, insulting attempt to divert attention from the government’s continued chaos in the NHS,” she said.
Around a dozen staff formed the picket line outside the ambulance base in Crawley.
“My members are striking today for fair pay. At the end of the day, they’ve had a 20 percent pay cut over the last 10 years, and they can no longer afford to keep going with that,” GMB union representative Lib Whitfield said.
Outside the West Midlands Ambulance Services’ hub in Longford in central England, striking staff stood behind a banner reading  “our NHS is under siege”.
As passing ambulances sounded their horns in support, union representative Steve Thompson called on the government to  “wake up and realise that this situation is serious”.

9,Russia to hone combat readiness of nuclear triad,President Putin proposes 30pc increase in size of armed forces...,"MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia will continue developing its military potential and the combat readiness of its nuclear forces against the backdrop of Moscow’s offensive in Western-backed Ukraine.
“The armed forces and combat capabilities of our armed forces are increasing constantly and every day. And this process, of course, we will build up on,” Putin said during a televised meeting with his country’s high-ranking officers.
He added that Russia will also  “improve the combat readiness of our nuclear triad”.
The Russian leader highlighted the new Zircon hypersonic cruise missile, which Russian troops will be able to use beginning January.

President Putin proposes 30pc increase in size of armed forces

“In early January, the Admiral Gorshkov frigate will be equipped with the new Zircon hypersonic missile, which has no equivalent in the world,” Putin said.
Nearly ten months into the fighting, Russia has faced a series of humiliating setbacks on the ground in Ukraine.
Russian Defence Minister 
Sergei Shoigu said that Russian servicemen in Ukraine are fighting  “the combined forces of the West” there. 
He added that Moscow plans to use two Ukrainian port cities on the Sea of Azov that its troops seized during the offensive — Berdyansk and Mariupol — as naval bases.
The defence minister also said it was necessary to increase the number of combat personnel in Russia’s army to 1.5 million troops.
He also proposed widening the age range for mandatory military service — currently between 18 and 27 — to 21 and 30.
Putin said he  “agreed to the suggestions for further structural changes to the armed forces,” adding that the reforms would not lead to the  “militarisation” of the country.
“We don’t have any limits on funding. The country and the government is giving everything that the army asks for, everything,” Putin added.
The Russian leader paid hommage to fallen soldiers during the ceremony.
He described the conflict in Ukraine as a  “shared tragedy” but placed blame for the outbreak of hostilities on Ukraine and its allies, not Moscow.
“What is happening is, of course, a tragedy — our shared tragedy. But it is not the result of our policy. It is the result of the policy of third countries.”
Russian  President Vladimir Putin gave his backing to a plan to  boost the size of the armed forces by more than 30 per cent as he said Moscow  needed to learn from and fix the problems it had suffered in Ukraine.
At  an end-of-year  conference  of Russia’s top military brass, Defence  Minister Sergei Shoigu proposed beefing up the armed forces to 1.5  million combat personnel from 1.15 million.
This was required  “to  guarantee the solving of problems related to Russia’s military  security”, Shoigu told Putin at the televised event. 
He said 695,000 of  the fighters should be professional contracted soldiers — as opposed to conscripts serving mandatory military service.
Putin had  signed a  decree  only this summer ordering troop numbers to be increased by  137,000 from Jan 1, 2023 to reach the 1.15 million level, and has also  drafted more than 300,000 reservists in a controversial mobilisation  drive to support Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The United States  and western military analysts say tens of thousands of Russian soldiers  have died in the 10 months since Moscow invaded Ukraine. On Sept 21 — the last time an official tally was shared publicly — Shoigu said 5,937  Russian soldiers  had been killed  there.

10,"Trump paid no tax in 2020, records show","The records show Trump's income, and his tax liability, fluctuated dramatically during his four years in the White House.","WASHINGTON: Donald Trump paid no income tax during the final full year of his presidency as he reported a loss from his sprawling business interests, according to tax figures released by a congressional panel. 
The records, released late on Tuesday by the Democratic-led House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee after a years-long fight, show that the former US president’s income, and his tax liability,  fluctuated dramatically during his four years in the White House. 
The records cut against the Republican leader’s  long-cultivated image as a successful businessman as he mounts another bid for the White House. 
Trump and his wife, Melania, paid some form of tax during all four years, the documents showed, but were able to minimise their income taxes in several years as income from Trump’s businesses was more than offset by deductions and losses. 
The committee questioned the legitimacy of some of those deductions, including one for $916 million, and members said on Tuesday the tax returns were short on detail. The panel is expected to release redacted versions of his full returns in coming days. 
Trump refused to make his tax returns public during his two presidential bids and his campaign for office, even though all other major-party presidential candidates have done so for decades.
