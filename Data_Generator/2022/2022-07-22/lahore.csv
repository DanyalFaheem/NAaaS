2,Nineteen MPAs-elect sworn in,LAHORE: Nineteen members-elect of the Punjab Assembly took oath of their offices at the ongoing 41st session of the...,"LAHORE: Nineteen members-elect of the Punjab Assembly took oath of their offices at the ongoing 41st session of the house here on Thursday.
Speaker Parvez Elahi administered oath to 15 members of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and independent MPA-elect Pir Rafiuddin Bukhari at the start of the proceedings as per law because three newly-elected MPAs of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz had not appeared in the house by that time.
As the PML-N and its allies have been boycotting proceedings of the 41st session since day one terming it ‘illegal’ as it had not been notified by the provincial law secretary under the amended law, many believed that the boycott would continue and the party would prefer delaying oath of its members until Friday (today) just before the re-poll for the chief minister’s office “in continuation of the 40th session”.
However, for fear of legal complications, the N-League ended the boycott and its three MPAs – Malik Asad Khokhar, Fida Hussain and Sibtain Reza – escorted by chief whip Tahir Khalil Sindhu entered the house and they were administered oath by Mr Elahi.
The speaker commented that the ruling party at last accepted [the legality] of our session by joining its proceedings.
Mr Sindhu said that the N-Leaguers were taking oath on his (speaker’s) ‘advice’.
The Election Commission did not notify the win of the fourth PML-N MPA-elect, Raja Saghir Ahmad from PP-7, Rawalpindi. Therefore, he didn’t come to take oath.
The PTI lawmakers who took oath included Zain Qureshi, Hassan Malik, Irfanullah Niazi, Mian Azam, Shabbir Gujjar, Malik Zaheer Abbas Khokhar, Nawaz Bharwana, Ghulam Sarwar, Amer Iqbal Shah, M Moazzam, Khurram Shehzad Virk, Mian Akram Usman, Qaiser Abbas, and Saifuddin Khosa.
Proceedings of the session were later put off for Saturday noon (tomorrow).
Meanwhile, the assembly secretariat has issued code for those attending the Friday’s session.
According to it, the MPAs could not take their cell phones into the assembly hall, while no guests of the lawmakers and assembly staff would be allowed to enter the assembly building.
All galleries, including the speaker’s box, officers’ box, and visitors’ gallery, would remain closed. But the press gallery would be opened to allow the media to cover proceedings for the election of the chief minister.

3,Dost Mazari seeks police cover for Punjab CM re-poll,"In letter to top officers, deputy speaker says police must be deployed not only outside PA building but also in the house.","LAHORE: Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari has sought security cover from the provincial chief secretary and the inspector general of police for peacefully holding the election to the office of chief minister as per court order on Friday.
In a letter to the top Punjab officers on Thursday, he said as the Lahore High Court had directed him to hold the [re-]poll for the CM’s office, he required police deployment to check recurrence of any untoward incident like it happened in the previous electoral bout. He said police must be deployed not only outside the assembly building but also in the house as part of foolproof security measures.  
During the last poll held on April 16, PTI MPAs, especially women lawmakers, had assaulted Mazari with plastic lotas, pulled his hair and injured him, disallowing him to conduct the polling process as the assembly’s security staff looked the other way apparently under influence of Speaker Parvez Elahi, who is a candidate in the election against Hamza Shehbaz.
He alleged in the letter that some elements were trying to obstruct the polling process and the assembly security would be unable to control the situation. In such a situation lives of the lawmakers and the staff would be in danger.
The deputy speaker was able to conduct the election only after police intervened on his request to maintain law and order in the house.

Under the arrangements, such a consumer may sell the additional energy to the respective power distribution company and make stocktaking (calculations) with it at the end of the month. Since the system allows the consumers to generate electricity from one kilowatt to one megawatt, Nepra issues licences to the applicants seeking generation below 25kW in the service area jurisdiction of all distribution companies. Before issuance of the licence, the respective companies are supposed to receive, scrutinise and process such applications.
According to an official document, Lesco, since launch of the project in 2016, received total 10,176 applications as of June, 2022 for issuance of licences for cumulative generation of around 185.975MW.

The posting orders were issued a few days after a candidate moved to the Lahore High Court (LHC) against the appointment process and the LHC directed the health secretary to produce the record related to the recruitment. 
It is for the first time that the government has made the appointments of new VCs of the medical varsities conditional while clearly mentioning in the official notifications that they would not hold any other assignment. 
According to the notifications, retired dean of the Children Hospital Lahore, Prof Ahsan Waheed Rathore, has been posted as VC of University of Health Sciences (UHS), Lahore, former principal of the Services Institute of Medical Sciences Prof Mahmood Ayaz would head the King Edward Medical University (KEMU), former KEMU VC Prof Khalid Masood Gondal has been made VC of the Fatima Jinnah Medical University (FJMU) while Prof Mohammad Umar and Prof Zafar Chaudhry have been reappointed as VCs of Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU) and Faisalabad Medical University (FMU), respectively. 
An official, privy to the information, told Dawn the Punjab government made appointments of these senior doctors when some of them assured in the affidavits that they had resigned from the other assignments. He said an official search committee, headed by retired Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jilani, had made recommendations for postings after the interviewing 50 retired and serving medical teachers. 
The official said that former chairman of Shaikh Zayed Hospital, Lahore, Prof Farid Ahmad Khan, who was also contesting for the posts, had sought LHC intervention to seek clarity for the criteria being followed by the search committee. 
Justice Shujaat Ali Khan of the LHC directed the secretary (specialised healthcare) to produce the record of the recruitment process against posts. The petitioner argued that allocation of 50 marks for interview went against the spirit of Recruitment Policy 2022. 
His counsel, Hafiz Tariq Nasim, alleged mala fide on the part of the respondents in the recruitment and pointed out to the court that the petitioner had professional rivalry with one of the members of the search committee, retired professor of plastic surgery, who had an axe to grind against the interest of the aggrieved petitioner as it was against Recruitment Policy of 2022.

7,Zardari says standing with PML-N firmly,LAHORE: Former president Asif Ali Zardari claims he had convinced the Sharifs for nominating Parvez Elahi as the...,"LAHORE: Former president Asif Ali Zardari claims he had convinced the Sharifs for nominating Parvez Elahi as the Punjab chief minister on the request of PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat back in April, when the PTI was removed from power from the centre and Punjab.
Talking to members of Punjab PPP parliamentary party here on Thursday, he said that he convinced Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz to accept Mr Elahi as the ruling alliance’s candidate for chief minister when Shujaat asked him to do so.
Mr Elahi backed out of his commitment and joined hands with Imran Khan at the eleventh hour, he regretted, adding the N-League however honored its commitment of accepting the Punjab Assembly speaker as their candidate in the poll for CM’s election, he added.
He said he did believe in the politics of reconciliation but as a follower of Bhutto would not do politics of buying loyalties. Referring to the allegations of horse trading, he said why he would invest for Hamza, a PML-N leader and [the allegations would have carried weight] had there been PPP leader Hassan Murtaza as the candidate in the contest taking place on Friday (today).
He said he was standing with the PML-N firmly in the electoral bout and was accepting all responsibilities in this respect.
About his presence in Lahore at the crucial time, he said he had announced three months ago that he would sit in Punjab for future politics.
Meanwhile, the PPP staged “Asif Ali Zardari Zindabad” rally on Thursday. Led by Rana Farooq, Faisal Mir and Azizur Rehman Chan, the participants carrying party flags marched from the Lahore Press Club up to Wapda House.
On the occasion, various speakers alleged the use of money for forming a government had been introduced by Imran Khan through his ‘ATMs’ back in 2018 but was now blaming others for the menace.
They asked if the PPP was forming its government in Punjab for which Mr Zardari would use his resources.
They said all knew that the ‘biggest daku’ of Punjab Parvez Elahi was offering tens of millions of rupees to the MPAs to become the chief minister though his party’s (PML-Q) parliamentary strength is only 10.
They claimed that a majority of the PTI MPAs didn’t wish to vote for the PML-Q’s nominee for CM office and that’s why Mr Elahi was offering a share of his ‘illegally accumulated wealth’ to the assembly members to become CM.
They asked if Mr Elahi was involved in buying loyalties of PML-N MPAs Jalil Sharaqpuri and Faisal Niazi and whether the PTI didn’t offer Rs100m to MPA Maulana Ilyas Chinioti while the latter in Saudi Arabia to perform Haj, and also referred to the audio leak in which former interior minister Sheikh Rashid was talking of horse trading.

9,Official nominated in inmate’s murder posted in high security prison,Step sets tongues wagging,"LAHORE: The Punjab home department ‘without a qualm’ has made appointment of a jail official in a high security prison, a couple of days after he was nominated in the murder case of a young under-trial prisoner.
The home department transferred deputy superintendent (executive) of Central Jail Faisalabad Fazal Elahi and posted him as deputy superintendent (judicial), high security prison, Mianwali, with immediate effect against a vacant slot.
A notification to the effect was issued by the Punjab home department late on Wednesday while making transfer and postings of two more jail officials.
Fazal Elahi (BS-17) was nominated along with nine other jail officials in the murder case of an under-trial prisoner, Imran Mushtaq (28).

Step sets tongues wagging

Imran was allegedly tortured to death in Central Jail Faisalabad on July 18 and his father Mushtaq Ahmad had lodged a case against them under sections 302, 147 and 149 of Pakistan Penal Code with Saddar police station.
Following the murder incident, the home department had transferred the superintendent of Central Jail Faisalabad Chaudhry Asghar and ‘rewarded’ him while making his appointment as head of the Central Jail Rawalpindi, also famous as Adiala Jail.
The step had raised a question mark on the accountability mechanism of the home department to provide protection to the lives of the inmates.
An official said the frequent appointments of jail officials having ‘tainted’ profile had brought to the limelight a ‘mindset’ of certain officers of the home department who were allegedly violating the law by relegating the accountability mechanism [in the prisons] to insignificance.
He said the officials who were directly associated with the negligence in the murder of young under-trial prisoner were enjoying ‘impunity.’
Inspector General of Prisons Punjab Mirza Shahid Saleem Baig has defended the appointment of the deputy superintendent (jail) who was nominated in the murder case.
“Since Fazal Elahi was not convicted by any court in the murder case, he can be appointed any time anywhere”, Mr Baig said while talking to Dawn on phone.
“The murder case is a first information report and if a government employee/official is nominated by the complainant that means he would be considered “innocent” unless he is declared guilty by the court,” he said.
To a question, Mr Baig said he had objection to the new appointment of Fazal Elahi and refused to talk on the findings of the inquiry committee which was formed by him to probe the murder incident of the under-trial prisoner to determine the role of the then superintendent of Central Jail Faisalabad and other officials.

The University of Education (UE) in collaboration with the Punjab Population Welfare Department organised a digital conference at its Township Campus on Thursday.
UE Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Talat Naseer Pasha said the solution to all problems of the country, including the rapidly growing population, lies in education. He said Pakistan was unable to meet its food demand after being an agricultural country and was forced to import wheat, pulses and many other food items.
“Our children are suffering from malnutrition due to lack of resources and this shortage is becoming alarming due to the rapidly growing population,” he said.
He said the best family planning is important not only for an individual or a family but for the entire country and we have to think seriously about how we can give our children a prosperous and healthy life.

The structure had been declared dangerous by the Buildings Department about 15 years ago, Dawn has learnt.  
All the in-charges of the RHC during their tenures had sent proposals to the department for its maintenance and repair work, however, their requests remained unheard, RHC in-charge Dr Kafeel told Dawn.  
The construction work of this building could not be started even when the proposal for the repair and maintenance had been approved and it was listed in the scheme No 1 and 2 of the department in the last fiscal year, he revealed.  

The structure was officially declared dangerous 15 years ago

Dr Kafeel said the 55 staffers of the RHC, including four medical officers (MOs), a woman medical officer (WMO) and a dentist, were providing health facilities to hundreds of villagers in three shifts on a daily basis. 
He said all of them were forced to use the building which had been declared dangerous about 15 years ago.  
MO Dr Abdullah said the employees had been working in the far-flung area to serve the people but not to commit suicide. He said that seeing the condition of the building, it is feared that a major accident could happen any time.
The paramedical staff told Dawn that on July 16, the roof of the ECG room collapsed, destroying equipment, furniture and other material but luckily there were no casualties as the number of patients was low that day due to rain. They said the administration took no measures to resolve the issue despite the roof collapse incident.  
Dr Lareb, the only WMO of the RHC, said she wanted to leave the station and could not stay at this dangerous place anymore.  
Describing the delay in the construction of the RHC building as administrative neglect, scores of villagers on Thursday also registered their protest outside the building. They demanded that the secretary health shift the building to a safer place on an immediate basis.  
The Bahawalnagar CEO health was not available for comment. Additional Deputy District Health Officer (ADDHO) Dr Waheed Afsar Bajwa told Dawn that the CEO had asked him to look into the matter. He said the equipment and the staffers were being shifted to a new building of a government school until the RHC building was properly repaired or a new building constructed.
While denying the claim of the ADDHO, the RHC in-charge said neither the RHC was being shifted to any government building nor had any such place been chosen yet.  
When contacted again, Bajwa said the RHC had a five-acre land, out of which four kanal were covered area and some of it was in a better condition. He said now it had been decided to use the better part of the RHC building instead of shifting it somewhere else.  
The paramedics claim that the entire building has been declared dangerous and it could collapse any moment.

Paddy and fodder crops over hundreds of acres have not only been ravaged because of outflow of the river water but thousands of acres, including residential areas, adjacent to the river have also been flooded, they said talking to the media persons on Thursday. 
The villagers warned that their area was under serious threat because a water channel had been formed through the breach. 
They termed it the responsibility of the administration to take appropriate safety measures in advance to avoid any untoward situation. However, they added, no one from the administration or the irrigation department bothered to take any step in this regard even after the passage of 48 hours despite being informed timely. 
The residents of the affected area said they were trying to plug the breach on their own for the last two days but in vain. 
They said that floodwater had reached residential localities and hundreds of people had been forced to evacuate the area in haste. They feared that if the administration remained inactive, a large area could be inundated and people would have to bear huge financial losses. 
Assistant Commissioner Ahmad Javed Cheema told Dawn the floodwater had affected only those who had cultivated crops and were residing on the riverbed. He said arrangements were being made to rebuild the protective barrier of the river and the irrigation department had been instructed in this regard. 
The Minchinabad irrigation sub-divisional officer was not available for comments.

Their two male accomplices, however, fled with looted Rs600,000 and 30 grams of gold ornaments.
The five-member gang reportedly used to roam in towns and villages as beggars. Females would entre houses and inform their male members about those houses where only females were present. The males would loot cash and gold ornaments at gunpoint and flee.  
The Sahiwal police arrested the three female beggars after a robbery was reported in the house of Qaisar Abbas in Sahiwal. The police said a local suspected the role of women beggars and he overpowered them with the help of females of the robbed house. Later, they handed them over to the police.  
According to the police, the women have confessed to committing robberies in different areas over the last three years.
