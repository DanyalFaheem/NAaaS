0,"50 PTI members ‘might’ vote against Parvez  Elahi, claims Rana Sanaullah",Concedes that PML-N workers didn’t campaign for party’s candidates in Punjab by-polls.,"KARACHI: Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah on Thursday hinted at the possibility of 50 PTI lawmakers in Punjab Assembly voting against Parvez Elahi — the party’s candidate against PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz — in the run-off election for Punjab chief minister that will take place today (Friday).
Addressing a press conference after the federal cabinet meeting, Mr Sanaullah said that it is possible that PTI members who are “sensible” and whose “conscience is alive” will question Mr Elahi’s selection as the candidate.
“PTI chairman Imran Khan had campaigned against Mr Elahi and called him ‘the biggest dacoit of Punjab’ and now he was asking his party to vote for him,” the minister said.
The lawmakers are also apprehensive on Mr Elahi’s statement to “instantly dissolve the assembly” on Mr Khan’s directives, the minister said, calling it an indication of how much value Mr Elahi gives to the assembly.

Says Imran used to call PTI’s CM candidate ‘Punjab’s biggest dacoit’; concedes that PML-N workers didn’t campaign for party’s candidates in by-polls

The minister rejected the PTI’s claims that PML-N was “buying” its party members, while admitting that the his pparty is “in contact with everyone” as it is their “political and democratic right”.
While saying that the PML-N “despises the politics of horse trading, Mr Sanaullah reminded the PTI chairman how independent candidates were brought into his party’s fold after the 2018 elections.
“Who spent money on the people you welcomed in your party [PTI] after the 2018 elections. Who spent the money on it? Whose plane was used [to bring people]?” he asked Mr Khan who has been alleging that the PML-N is using money to buy PTI’s members’ votes.
Mr Sanaullah added that although the PML-N thinks “Mr Elahi neither has the right nor the capacity to become the chief minister”, yet the party will not indulge in “buying and selling of votes”.
Mr Sanaullah, who is the president of PML-N’s Punjab chapter, also defended his party’s recent drubbing in the by-polls, saying that the defeat is “not indicative of the PML-N’s popularity”.
“No party’s popularity can be judged on 20 seats. The 20 people, whom we had given the tickets, carried the burden of Imran Khan’s incompetent and unpopular Punjab government,” he said.
He added that the constituents were miffed at the candidates, many of whom were minister in the Usman Buzdar-led government, for the lack of development work.
However, he conceded that the party’s decision to give tickets to disgruntled PTI members was rejected by its workers and supporters who didn’t camping wholeheartedly for these candidates.

1,PPP has no role in Sindh’s LG polls postponement: Shazia Marri,"Criticises PTI for levelling “baseless allegations”, laments “abusive and dirty propaganda against the Sindh government”.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) criticised the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PT) on Thursday for levelling “baseless allegations” over the postponement of local government elections in Sindh.
The second phase of local body polls in Sindh were put off until Aug 28 by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) due to bad weather, Federal Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Shazia Marri told reporters at a presser and lamented the “abusive and dirty propaganda against the Sindh government”.
Ms Marri, who is also PPP’s central information secretary, said the provincial government didn’t submit any request to the ECP for delaying the elections and noted that Karachi had received record monsoon rains this season.
She claimed that the PTI didn’t even field their candidates in most constituencies for the local government elections.
She also asked the ECP to announce a much-delayed decision in the foreign funding case against the PTI, adding that former prime minister Imran Khan had been criticising the election commission because of this case.
She also took exception to Mr Khan’s criticism of PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari, insisting that the former president and the party had no role in Punjab’s chief minister’s election.
Ms Marri regretted that Mr Khan was trying to divide the nation by playing the religious card.
“If a person joins the PTI, it is considered as halal [permissible] act, but if someone jumps ship, the party says it’s haram [forbidden],” she said.
She said when the PTI won elections, it claimed everything was right but started levelling rigging allegations in case it lost the contest.

2,Pakistani woman killed by husband in Chicago murder-suicide,"According to a police officer, the couple was going through a divorce.","WASHINGTON: “It’s pai­n­ful to walk away from someone you once loved. But it is even more painful to love someone who is careless with your heart,” 29-year-old Pakistani-Ame­rican Sania Khan wrote in one of her last social media posts.
Earlier this week, her estranged husband Raheel Ahmed, 36, arrived at her home in a Chicago suburb, shot her dead and then killed himself.
He travelled more than 700 miles from Alpharetta, Georgia, to Streeterville, Illinois to do so.
On Thursday, Sania’s father Haider Farooq Khan posted a brief announcement on her daughter’s Facebook page, saying: “My oldest daughter Sania Khan passed away.
Her funeral will be on Thursday after Asr prayer, at Chattanooga Islamic center. Please keep us in your duaa.”
The family lives in Chattanooga, Tennessee.
According to details, the couple was going through divorce proceedings and Sania had moved from Alpharetta to Chicago where she was doing professional photography.
The Chicago Tribune reported that police officers went to Sania Khan’s apartment at about 4:30pm on Monday after they received a call for a welfare check.
When they arrived, they heard the sound of a gunshot and a man groaning. Inside, officers found Sania dead near the door. She had a gunshot wound to the back of her head, The Chicago Sun-Times reported.
Raheel was discovered in a bedroom with a head injury. Police found a handgun in his hand and a suicide note was discovered nearby.
Raheel was transported to Northwestern Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Later, the Cook County Coroner confirmed both deaths.
Police went to Sania’s apartment after Raheel’s family reported him missing from the Atlanta suburb, where he lived.
According to an Alpharetta police officer, the two were going through a divorce.
“RIP Sania Khan! She decided to end an abusive marriage, but her ex-husband killed her,” said a note on her Facebook page.
“Sadly, she didn’t have support from her family or the society. Desi people care more about their reputation than their child’s happiness,” the note added, reminding South Asian parents that “a divorced daughter is better than a dead daughter!”
Before she was shot, Sania Khan posted videos on TikTok about how difficult it was for a South Asian woman to seek divorce.

3,Bid to influence Punjab CM poll can lead to Lanka-like situation: Imran,"Claims govt may pick up MPAs to hamper Parvez Elahi’s election; warns ""neutrals"" against snatching his party’s mandate.","LAHORE: A night before Friday’s run-off election for the Punjab chief minister, PTI chairman Imran Khan urged the masses to take to the streets if they see the government, state machinery or “neutrals” (a term he uses to refer to the establishment) attempting to snatch the public mandate during the process.
“Any violence unleashed by the state machinery to steal public mandate will lead the country to a Sri Lanka-like situation,” he said, adding that he won’t be able to control people if any element tried to steal public mandate,” he stressed. He was addressing a mass protest demonstration at Liberty Roundabout through a video link on Thursday night.
Imran Khan said PPP leader Asif Zardari was in Lahore trying to pose as a kingmaker, when he should be languishing in jail. He alleged the “looters” were using ill-gotten money to buy the conscience of lawmakers, and alleged that one of his MPAs was bribed and sent to Turkiye.
The former prime minister further said the PTI and PML-Q had lodged their 186 MPAs at a local hotel fearing the state might pick them up and detain them in cases registered against unidentified people, to block their presence in the Punjab Assembly for voting for the chief minister.

Claims govt may ‘pick up’ MPAs to hamper Elahi’s election; warns ‘neutrals’ against snatching his party’s mandate

He reiterated that “three stooges” — Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman — were instrumental in the alleged foreign conspiracy to topple the PTI government through a no-confidence motion, and claimed that even PML-N MNA Javed Latif had admitted they were pushed to move the resolution.
Apprehending that they would go all out in efforts to ‘buy’ PTI MPAs, the former premier warned state institutions against trying to create a May 25-like situation.
CM poll strategy
Earlier, Mr Khan chaired a joint PTI and PML-Q parliamentary party meeting as well as holding separate meetings with MPAs in groups to discuss the strategy for Friday’s session where he aims to get their candidate, Mr Elahi, elected chief minister.
Mr Khan lauded the MPAs for standing tall despite all odds, amid pressure from the PML-N government.
Separately, PTI vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi called on Elahi at his residence here and held a detailed consultation on the strategy regarding the election today, and the tactics that could be employed by the government to create disturbance.
Mr Elahi said the vindictive tactics of the federal and the Punjab governments were condemnable, adding that any attempt to undermine people’s mandate would not be tolerated.
Mr Qureshi said the public fully supported Imran Khan’s narrative in the by-elections and taught the turncoats (PTI defectors) a lesson.
Moonis Elahi, MNA Hussain Elahi, MPAs Basharat Raja and Zain Qureshi also attended the meeting.

Ali Akbar Sakhi, the first climber from Afg­hanistan to attempt the summit, passed away on the mountain due to a heart attack. He was part of the Pakistani K2 expedition team.
Meanwhile, at least one Nepalese rope fixing team comprising five climbers managed to reach atop K2 on Thursday around 9pm. Muhammad Ali Nagri from Adventure Pak­istan told Dawn that the Nepalese team fixed ropes to the top of the peak. “Now K2 route has been opened for climbers,” he added.
The names of the five Sherpa guides are Pasdawa Sherpa and Chhiring Namgyal of 8K Expeditions, and Siddhi Ghising, Dorjee Gyelzen Sherpa, and Rinji Sherpa of Madison Mountaineering.

Wajahat, the tour organiser, told Dawn that the 13-member team of foreign trekkers, including two Pakistanis, started their base camp trek from Skardu about 10 days ago. He said Ms Sarah complained about breathing problems at Concordia and started vomiting on Wednesday. “She has breathing problems and has been vomiting incessantly, the tour operator said, urging the government to rescue her.
Route to K2 open

5,SITUATIONER: ‘Loyalty through detention’ — a return to politics of the ’80s,Both the treasury and opposition have separately lodged their loyalists in three five-star hotels in the provincial capital.,"

AT a recent presser, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah had some ominous words for the opposition in Punjab: “We will not let Elahi become the chief minister so easily. If five to seven PTI lawmakers do not show up on Friday, how will the party have its chief minister?”
This warning paved the way for a trans-party strategy for the Punjab chief minister’s election, being held today in Lahore, and a sense of déjà vu has pervaded the political process ever since. The PML-Q, which is steering the campaign for the opposition alliance as its senior leader Chaudhry Parvez Elahi is a nominee for the highest office of the province, has also dusted off this time-tested formula of lodging lawmakers in one place, keeping them under watch and ensuring loyalty through ‘detention’.
Both the treasury and opposition have separately lodged their loyalists in three five-star hotels in the provincial capital, where the media has free access and both sides are boasting required numbers ahead of the poll.
“What else can be done to secure our members from the greed of massive money that circulates during these elections or the unrelenting pressure from the agencies,” wonders PML-Q Senator Kamil Ali Agha.
He, however, claims the party has made arrangements only for the stay of newly minted MPAs because they did not have official residences in the city yet. “Our party is on the record protesting against the Intelligence Bureau’s ‘track and trace’ operation against our MPAs. How else to deal with the situation if not by insulating our members through a collective effort? Though keeping them at one place is more of a psychological consolation and has limited practical utility. If someone wants to switch sides, there is hardly any effective way to stop him/her. But, it does rob them of lame excuses to avoid following the party line,” Mr Agha adds.
This strategy of housing parliamentarians at one place, to be produced at an opportune time, has been in vogue since the late ’80s, when then-Punjab chief minister Nawaz Sharif huddled his MPAs at a forest resort in central Punjab — Changa Manga — and introduced a new tactic for warding off political challenge.
Since then, it has become a fundamental rule for politicians to fight for (political) survival; recently, the PPP employed this approach when it lodged PTI dissident members of the National Assembly at Sindh House, Islamabad in March this year ahead of the no-confidence motion against the then premier Imran Khan.
A month later, the PML-N transported all provincial lawmakers supporting incumbent CM Hamza Shehbaz, including 25 PTI dissidents, to a Lahore hotel. As the PTI mounted protests outside the hotel concerned in Gulberg, they were safely shifted to the more secure Cantonment areas and produced in the Punjab Assembly on April 30 to elect Hamza as the chief minister.
The PTI, especially its chairman Imran Khan, has long been an ardent critic of this “anti-democracy, feudal and corrupt practice”, but has now become the latest entrant to the club practicing this cardinal approach.
The PML-Q and its leadership — the much-venerated Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi — that has been synonymous with ‘decency and trusting people’, and took pride in it too, also fell for it.
Both opposition parties have moved their members to a local hotel as insurance against any, what they call, “sale-purchase”.
Though every party has preferred this line of action when chips are down, but it also has its critics among politicians, who deem it insulting for lawmakers as a “class” and only paints them as “undependable, open to auction”.
“It is pure moral degradation of society,” regrets Mohsin Leghari, a former PTI provincial minister.
One can hardly defend any aspect of this sordid exercise. Each time, it has happened under full media glare, successive governments have known about it, all parties have criticised it, yet practiced it repeatedly: look at the PML-N, which invented this approach, refined the tactics and regularly practiced it, Mr Leghari maintains.
A PML-N leader, who did not want to be named for the sensitivity of the matter for his party, says one needs to consider why this strategy was invented and practiced. “Only because the ‘invisible forces’, as party supremo Nawaz Sharif calls them, have regularly rigged the process: scared or lured lawmakers into defection, made and broken political parties at will. It was, in fact, a practical response to a particular situation, not a moral issue. Since it worked, even those who have been criticising it are now utilizing it. It’s realpolitik, and should be considered as such, not judged on moral grounds,” the ruling party leader said.

6,Balochistan orders stricter action against terrorists,"Adviser to CM on Home Ziaullah Langove directs authorities to review security of sensitive installations, places of worship.","QUETTA: Adviser to the Balochistan Chief Minister on Home Mir Ziaullah Langove on Thursday ordered the law enforcement agencies to speed up operations against terrorists and extremists to maintain peace in the province.
Presiding over a meeting to review the law and order situation, Mr Langove asked the authorities concerned to review the security of sensitive installations, places of worship and educational institutions.
In view of the recent attacks in the province, Mr Langove also ordered strict monitoring of banned organisations, terrorists and extremist elements, including their facilitators.
He asked the CTD and Special Branch to speed up intelligence-based and combing operations while closely monitoring the movement of persons on Fourth Schedule.
The adviser said the process of searches at inter-provincial and intra-provincial security posts should be improved to check the movement of terrorists.
Arms licences
The Balo­chistan cabinet has lifted the ban on issuance of licences for non-prohibited weapons and directed the home deportment to make a policy for the purpose.
The cabinet approved a proposal for making legislation on permanent residence certificate (PRC) for residents of Balochistan.
The meeting also approved an amended formula for distributing posts between BSS and BCS services. Under the formula, 60 per cent posts of grades 18 and 19 would be given to BSS and 40pc to BCS. In order to do away with disparity, 66pc newly-created posts would be given to BSS and 34pc to BCS.

7,Death toll from wedding boat tragedy rises to 33,"Three more bodies were recovered from River Indus on Thursday, four days after the overcrowded boat capsized.","DADU: Three more bodies were recovered from the River Indus on Thursday, four days after an overcrowded boat capsized near Sadiqabad, taking the death toll from the tragedy to 33.
The bodies of three women floated to the surface during efforts to find the 17 passengers still said to be missing. Earlier, two women’s bodies were found near Guddu late on Wednesday night. However, officials have said that the chances of recovering any more people — alive or dead — were very slim.
“It has been more than 56 hours since the incident, and there’s no chance of finding any more survivors,” district administration spokesperson Kashif Nisar Gill told journalists.
He added that around 35 divers were taking part in the operation, while locals were assisting rescue teams.
Solangi clan chieftain Sardar Abbas Khan Solangi alleged that even after four days, the governments of Punjab and Sindh were reluctant to provide relief to the victims and their families.
He added that that no lawmakers from either province had visited the victims’ families, nor was any compensation anno­unced for them.
On Monday, a boat carrying around 100 passengers capsized in the storm-swollen River Indus. The passengers on board belonged to Solangi tribe who were on their way from Mochka to a family wedding across the river in Sardarpur, in Union Council Kahror wali in Sadiqabad’s Rojhan Tehsil.
The victims hailed from Hussain Baksh Solangi village of Deh Dhand of Obaro in Ghotki district.

He said the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker should invite former presiding officers of the two houses of parliament to assess the situation and suggest a way forward.
“This is a serious issue in a diverse federation such as Pakistan as parliament is the lynchpin of the federation. A weak parliament is a weak federal Pakistan,” Mr Rabbani said.
He said the Senate chairman and the NA speaker should lock their houses as proceedings of a municipal committee had more sanctity. He said all institutions of the state functioning through or under the Constitution were disregarding the concept of trichotomy of power, independence and Article 69 in respect of parliament.
“As I had warned earlier, the Supreme Court’s detailed reasoning in the matter of the deputy speaker of the National Assembly is being misconstrued and the ambit of Article 69 of Constitution is being overstepped,” he said.
The PPP leader said that placing fetters on the functioning of parliamentary committees would affect the legislature’s independence and would hamper parliamentary oversight.
He criticised the government for its failure to place and discuss important agreements and policies in parliament. “The terms of the staff-level agreement with the IMF have not been laid in parliament. Parliament, not a select group of parliamentarians, is unaware of the negotiations with the TTP,” he said.

10,SC defers hearing on contempt petition against Hamza,Makes observation that court will not keep its eyes closed to any violation of the law.,"ISLAMABAD: A day before the election of Punjab chief minister, the Supreme Court decided on Thursday to keep pending a contempt of court petition against Hamza Shehbaz and federal Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, but made an observation that the court would not keep its eyes closed to any violation of the law.
Headed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan, a two-judge bench asked the petitioner, Punjab Assembly Speaker Parvez Elahi, to look into the allegations about attempts by certain elements to bribe PTI MPAs into voting for Hamza Shehbaz, the ruling coalition’s candidate.
Faisal Fareed, who represented the petitioner, said the respondents were violating a July 1 Supreme Court order that Hamza Shehbaz must remain within the confines of the Constitution and refrain from harassment of his political opponents during the run-up to the chief minister’s election on July 22.
The counsel presented affidavits by three PTI MPAs in which they accused their opponents of offering them bribes to vote for Hamza Shehbaz. He also referred to a statement by the interior minister in which he had dropped hints that five MPAs might stay away from the Punjab Assembly session in which the chief minister is to be elected.
The court, however, asked Faisal Fareed to cite specific clauses of the July 1 order which, the petitioner believed, had been violated.
The counsel further alleged that Raheela, a PML-N MPA, had offered an unspecified amount of money to three PTI legislators and that Atta Tarar, a spokesman for the Punjab government, had offered Rs250 million to these MPAs.
But the court made it clear that it needed concrete evidence to reach a conclusion.
The Supreme Court also asked Faisal Fareed whether the PTI had complained to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) about the violation of election laws. He replied that the party’s relationship with the ECP was strained these days.
Justice Ahsan observed that making tall claims was a common practice before any election, but assured the counsel the apex court would be on the lookout for violation of the law.
In his contempt of court petition, Chaudhry Parvez Elahi had pleaded before the Supreme Court to summon the alleged contemnor for violating its July 1 directive.
The petitioner alleged that the respondents, after losing majority in the Punjab Assembly, had got nervous and were resorting to unfair practices out of despair and frustration.
