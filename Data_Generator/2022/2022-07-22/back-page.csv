0,PTI plea for recount in PP-7 turned down,"Election Commission says only general allegations levelled, which are ‘insufficient’; PTI candidate likely to take ECP to court","ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday rejected Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) plea seeking a recount of votes in PP-7 (Rawalpindi-II), a constituency it lost to the PML-N by a wafer-thin margin of 49 votes on July 17.
In a decision that came a day ahead of the election for the chief minister of Punjab, Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja said that PTI candidate Shabbir Awan could neither prove any fraud or irregularity, nor was he able to state the ‘cogent’ reasons for the recount.
In a related development, the ECP also notified victory of 19 members of the Punjab Assembly who won the recently held by-polls.
PTI candidate Shabbir Awan represented by former additional advocate general Shaukat Rauf Siddiqui advocate and Barrister Raja Jibran Tariq Ali and PML-N candidate Raja Sagheer Ahmed represented by Sardar Taimoor Aslam appeared before the bench.

Election Commission says only general allegations levelled, which are ‘insufficient’; PTI candidate likely to take ECP to court again

During the Punjab by-elections on Sunday, PML-N’s Raja Sagheer had won the by-poll on the provincial assembly seat with a margin of just 49 votes, defeating Awan. Subsequently, Awan submitted an application to the returning officer and requested a recount. His plea was, however, rejected drawing criticism from the PTI.
The decision was challenged in the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi bench, which while restraining the RO from consolidating the results had converted the petition into an application under section 95(6) of the Elections Act, which the ECP took up for hearing on Thursday.
ECP hearing
At the outset of the hearing, CEC Raja took the PTI candidate to task for his claim before the LHC that his application seeking recount was not being entertained by the ECP. The CEC observed that the PTI had not filed any application until 5pm on Wednesday.
“You submitted a request to the R&I department but withdrew it after 10 minutes. You filed the petition after the high court judgment,” the ECP chief said, summoning the officials of the R&I branch for a written account of what transpired on the voting day.
The CEC also chided the PTI candidate for his claim about the breakdown of the Result Transmission System (RTS), pointing out that RTS had not been used in the by-polls.
Awan’s counsel said that they had approached the court as the margin between the votes of the two parties was very thin. He contended that as soon as the results were announced, his client had immediately approached the RO and later the court for a recount.
PML-N leader Raja Sagheer’s lawyer called PTI’s request “baseless”. “Initially, they were seeking recount in the entire constituency. Now they are talking about 21 polling stations,” he said, adding that PTI’s stance was “invalid because it kept changing”.
Detailed order
In its detailed order, the CEC said the ECP may order the returning officer directly to conduct a recount if it deemed the circumstances to be grave enough to warrant such a recount.
It said the petitioner has not approached the RO, the DRO, the provincial election commission, or the ECP Secretariat with any complaint of illegalities or irregularities during the election process on the poll day.
It also said the petitioner has also failed to point out any snatching of ballot boxes, misuse of authority by the presiding officers or the returning officers, or any other grave illegality or irregularity.
It noted that only general allegations had been levelled which were not sufficient to attract recounting.
Following the ECP order, PML-N candidate Raja Sagheer is most likely to be notified as a returned candidate today (Friday), unless a stay would be granted against the process.
Meanwhile, sources told Dawn that the PTI candidate is likely to approach the Lahore High Court to challenge the ECP order.
The party, via its official Twitter account, took an exception to the ruling and declared it not only against the law, but tantamount to undermining the election process in a “huge way”. The tweet also referred to the accusations of bias, levelled against the CEC by PTI Chairman Imran Khan.

DROUPADI Murmu

 
NEW DELHI: A woman from India’s tribal minority, Droupadi Murmu, was elected as the country’s president on Thursday with the backing of the ruling party, making her the first person from the marginalised community to occupy the top post.
Murmu, who is from the Santhal tribe, secured the largely ceremonial position with the support of more than half the electorate of MPs and state legislators, partial results released by the election commission showed. Murmu, 64, was nominated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party for the post.
Modi tweeted to congratulate Murmu, saying her “exemplary success motivates each and every Indian”.
“She has emerged as a ray of hope for our citizens, especially the poor, marginalised and the downtrodden.”
Murmu will be the country’s second woman president after Pratibha Patil, who held the position for five years from 2007, and succeeds Ram Nath Kovind, the second president from the Dalit community.

2,"Italian PM resigns, paving way for snap polls",Current surveys suggest rightist alliance will win election comfortably,"

ROME: Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi resigned on Thursday after the country’s fractious parties torpedoed his national unity government, kicking off a snap election campaign which could bring the hard right to power.
Mr Draghi formally handed his resignation to President Sergio Mattarella, who is likely to dissolve parliament and call early elections for September or October. Draghi will stay on as head of the government until then.
“Italy betrayed,” the Repubblica daily front page cried, while the Stampa ran with “For Shame”.
Based on current polls, a rightist alliance led by Giorgia Meloni’s post-fascist Brothers of Italy party would comfortably win a snap vote. “No more excuses,” tweeted Meloni, 45, who vociferously led the opposition throughout Draghi’s term and has long called for fresh elections.

Current surveys suggest rightist alliance will win election comfortably

Draghi, a former European Central Bank chief, was parachuted into the premiership in 2021 as Italy wrestled with a pandemic and ailing economy.
On Wednesday, he attempted to save the government, urging his squabbling coalition to put aside their grievances for the sake of the country. But three parties — Silvio Berlusconi’s centre-right Forza Italia, Matteo Salvini’s anti-immigrant League and the populist Five Star Movement — said it was no longer possible for them to work together.
Enough craziness
The stunned centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which had supported Draghi, said its hopes were now pinned on Italians being “wiser than their MPs”.
Italy’s latest crisis was sparked when Five Star snubbed a key vote last week, despite warnings from Draghi that it would fatally undermine the coalition.
“Enough with Five Star craziness and PD power plays: Italians now get to choose,” anti-immigrant Salvini tweeted on Thursday.
Though Five Star triggered the crisis, it was Salvini who pushed Draghi under the metaphorical bus, political commentators said.
The former interior minister, who has been losing voters to Meloni, “saw an opportunity to regain his primacy, in the centre-right and within the League”, editorialist Marco Damilano wrote in the Domani daily.
Draghi’s downfall comes despite recent polls suggesting most Italians wanted him to stay at the helm until the scheduled general election next May.
Supporters of Draghi had warned a government collapse could worsen social ills in a period of rampant inflation, delay the budget, threaten EU post-pandemic recovery funds and send jittery markets into a tailspin.
Laurence Boone, France’s European affairs minister, said Draghi’s resignation would open a “period of uncertainty” and mark the loss of a “pillar of Europe”.
The Brothers of Italy party, which has neo-fascist roots, is leading in the polls, with 23.9 per cent of voter intentions, according to a SWG survey held three days before Draghi’s resignation.
To win a majority it would need the support of the League (polling at 14 per cent) and Forza Italia (7.4pc). The PD is just behind Brothers of Italy, with 22.1pc, but may be forced to ally with the troubled Five Star (polling at 11.2pc), if it is to have a chance at beating the right.
Should a Brothers of Italy-led coalition win, it “would offer a much more disruptive scenario for Italy and the EU”, wrote Luigi Scazzieri, senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform.

3,ANALYSIS: ALL THAT GLITTERS IS ALL THAT MATTERS,"SBP holds $3.82bn worth of gold, which is more than half the total funds that IMF is expected to disburse.","DOLLAR reserves are shrinking as quickly as a popped balloon; the exchange rate is at an all-time high, while yields on our international bonds have gone through the roof.
In short, we’re running out of dollar bills to pay for food and fuel imports. Yet the much-awaited inflows from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are at least a month away.
A rather novel idea, which has emerged amidst the search for quick fixes, calls on the government to sell its gold reserves for dollars.
Or, as a couple of financial experts suggest, the state-owned precious metal can at least be pledged as security for borrowing greenbacks from global banks at affordable interest rates.

In the search for quick fixes, some experts suggest govt can leverage its gold reserves for dollars; not everyone thinks it’s a good idea

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) holds as much as $3.82 billion worth of gold — that’s more than half the total funds that the IMF is expected to disburse under its current loan programme. The SBP-held foreign exchange reserves amounting to $9.7bn don’t include the current value of gold reserves.
“We should seriously consider pledging this gold with some banks in the Middle East or China and borrow against it to generate dollars,” said Asif Qureshi, executive chairman of Optimus Capital Management, a Karachi-based brokerage and financial advisory company.
“These gold reserves don’t generate any returns. They have no practical use for anyone. Since no international bank is currently willing to lend us funds, the government should think about utilising these gold reserves to generate dollars,” he told Dawn on Wednesday.
Loans that have gold as collateral carry minimal interest rates. After all, gold is a tangible asset that’s been used as a store of value for thousands of years in every part of the world.
SBP’s former deputy governor Riaz Riazuddin said using gold reserves to borrow dollars is a “very good proposal”. But the process of pledging requires that the asset be physically taken out of the vaults of the borrowing nation and shipped off overseas. “That’ll be extremely bad optics,” said Mr Riazuddin, who also briefly served as acting governor of the central bank.
“The proposal should be actively pursued only if the economic managers can bring in dollars without getting the gold bricks shipped out of the country,” he said.
Topline Securities CEO Mohammed Sohail also called for monetising gold reserves. “Why can’t #Pakistan use/pledge its USD4b worth of Gold reserves?” he tweeted on Thursday, while referring to India that pledged gold in 1991 to fight a foreign exchange crisis.

 





 
Relic of ‘gold standard’ days
Pakistan’s gold reserves date back to the long-forgotten days of the gold standard when currencies were convertible into gold at a fixed price. The entire world went off the gold standard completely when President Nixon abandoned it in 1971 to stop foreign governments from redeeming dollars for gold at a fixed price amid rising inflation in the United States.
Government-issued fiat money — i.e. all kinds of money that are made legal tender by a government decree — has since replaced the gold standard. Central banks now control the supply of money using tools such as interest rates, note printing and bank reserve requirements.
But if there’s no use of gold reserves in a modern economy with fiat money, why do so many central banks still keep some of their holdings in the precious metal? According to one economist, these are kept as a contingency measure in the case of war or sudden trade sanctions.
For example, the United States has unilaterally restricted sovereign states like Russia, Iran and Afghanistan from accessing their own foreign exchange reserves in the recent past. Gold comes in handy in such circumstances.
“Rogue” nations circumvent international trade sanctions by using their gold reserves to import food and oil. It’s been a universally accepted medium of exchange since time immemorial because its intrinsic value is determined by markets, not governments. In fact, the well-worn expression of “sound money” literally comes from the metallic ring of a gold coin dropping onto a hard surface.
Selling the ‘family silver’
If gold reserves offer such an easy short-term fix to our perennial balance-of-payments crisis, why didn’t any government resort to it in the past? Simply put, gold reserves are like an asset — or family silver, to put it colloquially — that gets handed down like an heirloom from one generation to the next.
“People get upset when a motorway gets pledged for a routine Sukuk transaction. It’d be a scandal if the government sold or pledged gold for hard cash,” said Mr Qureshi.
Miftah Ismail, chief economic fire-fighter in the coalition government, appeared to be in no mood to support the idea that comes with a “highly flammable” warning sign. No such proposal is under consideration, he said. “We’re not going to either sell or pledge gold to raise dollars,” he told Dawn between hurriedly called press conferences on Thursday.
The chief spokesperson for the SBP, which is in physical possession of gold reserves, didn’t respond to a request for comment until the filing of this report.
The gold-for-dollars idea was termed “stupid” and “idiotic” by Dr Kaiser Bengali, a left-leaning development economist with stints in the Sindh and Balochistan governments.
“The balance-of-payments crisis will re-emerge within no time, even if you sell the entire gold reserves at once. It’s illogical to sell national assets for short-term goals,” he said.
He went on to claim that even if the entire stock of foreign loans was miraculously brought down to zero, the same would go back up in a short period of time.
“Our problem is that the increase in imports outpaces the growth in exports. We’ll always be short of dollars if we don’t address the root cause of the problem,” he said.
“Selling gold won’t fix anything,” Dr Bengali said.
