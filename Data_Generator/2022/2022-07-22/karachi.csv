2,Only 343 cases of child sexual exploitation reported in five years,"FIA chief, Meta say 2.1m child pornography images uploaded on Facebook from Pakistan in 2021 alone.","KARACHI: While over two million cases of child exploitation imagery uploaded on to Facebook in 2021 in the country, a top official of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) puts the number of reported cases at 343 during the past five years, urging people to report cases and lodge complaints against sexual predators.
“We have responsibility towards the protection of children, all of us do. And my duty is to enforce the laws here. The protection of the rights of the child in cyberspace is extremely important. Unfortunately, we are among the countries with the highest incidences, which amounted to 2.1 million in 2021,” FIA Director General Mohammed Tahir Rai told an event here on Thursday
“But our nation is not reporting these to the law enforcement agencies and not to Meta also. Due to this only 343 such cases have been reported in the last five years. I am glad that Meta is removing such material from its platform,” he said.
The FIA chief was speaking at an event — Child Protection and Digital Safety Dialogue — organised by Zindagi Trust in collaboration with the technological company Meta, which powers Facebook, at the Government Elementary College of Education in Hussainabad.

FIA chief, Meta say 2.1m child pornography images uploaded on Facebook from Pakistan in 2021 alone 

Besides identifying ways to make digital platforms safer for children and share policy recommendations with government agencies to help create better reporting mechanisms, the collaboration also saw the launching of the campaign titled #ReportDontShare that pushes for reporting inappropriate content to help remove it instead of sharing it further on social media platforms.
Accompanied by representatives from the FIA’s Cyber Crime Wing, Mr Tahir Rai emphasised on the lack of reported cases in Pakistan. He encouraged people to report cases and lodge complaints against sexual predators to help FIA take immediate action.
According to Meta, there were over two million cases of child exploitation imagery uploaded on to Facebook in 2021 in Pakistan. 
Joining online, Michael Yoon, the manager trust and safety, law enforcement and outreach at Meta, said that they were working with the FIA and other law enforcement agencies in Pakistan to catch criminals involved in cybercrime including blackmail, extortion, terrorism, etc.
Also joining online, the head of safety policy at Meta, Shireen Vakil, informed the audience about safety measures available for young users on Meta to safeguard themselves from predators online. 
She highlighted the new technology being used at Meta, including artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect inappropriate content and remove it accordingly.
A member of the National Commission on the Rights of Child, Iqbal Detho, stressed the need to review the Pakistan Electronic Criminal Act (PECA) as well as the Pakistan Penal Code and make amendments for child safety in digital spaces. 
He also emphasised the implementation of policy making at the provincial level to help bring justice and provide legal aid to the victims.
Sarim Aziz, the director public policy, South Asia, Meta, said that they have a zero tolerance policy for content related to child exploitation and abuse. 
“We use latest ground-breaking technology to prevent, detect and remove content related to child abuse and violence,” he said.
“Since this is a highly sensitive matter, we take a comprehensive approach to keep our family of apps free of such malicious content and continue to collaborate with local authorities, rights bodies and relevant stakeholders to fully ensure that the victims are not repeatedly traumatised by sharing evidence of their ordeal. Instead the content should be reported through proper channels so that the government agencies can move against those responsible,” he added.
Sharing his thoughts on the campaign, Zindagi Trust founder and president Shehzad Roy said that whenever he encountered disturbing content, his first instinct would be to share it so it could help find the perpetrator. “However, I have realised that the content can be distressing for many viewers and is a breach of privacy of the victims,” he said.
Earlier, the organisers also played an informative video produced by them to educate people about the harms of sharing inappropriate content and encourage them to report malicious content through proper channels instead of sharing it further.
“We want to push for justice for victims and advocate for safer digital spaces instead of sensationalising traumatic events. Zindagi Trust takes pride in being a vocal advocate of policy level change for children’s safety and education. We rely on the support of government institutions and social media companies like Meta to help us achieve our goals,” he added.

3,"Ruling coalition partners saved by ECP from defeat in LG polls, allege opposition parties","PTI, JI, TLP stage demonstrations against Election Commission decision to delay local govt elections till Aug 28.","KARACHI: A day after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) postponed the second phase of local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad, political parties, including those who were pleading for the same on different grounds, on Thursday came up with strong reactions against the decision calling it a favour to the ruling alliance in the Centre, who was seeking an “escape from an imminent defeat” in the crucial polls. 
PTI stages protest at EC office 
Leading the protest, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf staged a protest demonstration outside the regional ECP office in Saddar and sought an explanation by the constitutional body for its ‘change of heart’ just hours before the July 24 voting. 
The PTI leaders dema­nded resignation of the ECP chief accusing him of partiality in all elections across the country these days. 
A large number of party workers led by legislators and local leaders gathered outside the ECP building, chanted slogans and demanded review of its fresh decision. 

PTI, JI, TLP stage demonstrations against Election Commission decision to delay local govt elections till Aug 28

Earlier, addressing a press conference at his office, Leader of the Opposition in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh said that the “imported government” deliberately delayed the second phase of local government polls in Sindh because it knew that its component parties would be “badly defeated”. 
“The imported government has seen what is written on the wall,” he said. “The ruling coalition has fled from the LB polls. These polls were got rescheduled only two days before the voting day. During the first phase of elections we went to court that legislation regarding these polls was not done as per Article 140 A of the constitution, but the polls were not postponed. Only two days ago Nasir Shah [Sindh minister] wrote to the Election Commission that preparations were made for holding the local bodies polls, but due to the fear of defeat, they have fled from the polls now.”
Jamaat condemns EC
The Jamaat-i-Islami also “condemned” the ECP decision and announced to stage a sit-in outside its building today [Friday] to lodge its protest. 
Addressing a press conference at Idara Noor-i-Haq, JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman said that the ECP had not only made a “bad decision”, but also put false allegations against his party. 
“The ECP in its press release has claimed that Jamaat had also sought delay in the July 24 polls,” he said. 
“It’s a blatant lie. We have only pleaded to reschedule the by-polls in NA-245 only to avoid burden and mismanagement on the Election Commission. We demand the Election Commission to tender an apology over misleading the people and twisting facts. The Jamaat e Islami would lead Karachiites tomorrow [Friday] to stage a sit-in against the Election Commission for its incompetence and lies.”
EC says JI sought rescheduling
The Election Commission of Pakistan said the Jamaat-i-Islami itself sought rescheduling of the second phase of polls in an application submitted to it on June 18.
An ECP spokesman said in a statement that JI Election Cell Chairman and Naib Ameer of party Raja Arif Sultan Minhas had moved an application in Provincial Election Commissioner, Sindh on June 18, 2022 requesting the Commission to postpone LG polls (second phase) as well as NA 245 by-polls.
He said the ECP postponed the elections in NA 245 and LG polls after considering JIs application and some other factors.
PPP rejects criticism
The ruling PPP, which was facing serious criticism and accused of favouring the delay in the polls, came up with a clarification that it was not the Sindh government nor the ruling party which had suggested to postpone the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad. 
“The polling for the second phase of the local government elections as per the original schedule on July 24 would have been in the interest of the PPP,” said Sindh Labour Minister Saeed Ghani, who is also the PPP Karachi president, in a statement. 
No provincial govt functionary had written to the ECP for deferring the local government polls, he said. 
“Postponing the elections is purely ECP’s own decision. The opposition parties for their own political interests have started blaming the Sindh government and the PPP for the postponement of the municipal polls.”
PSP rejects ECP decision 
In a statement, former Karachi mayor and chairman Pak-Sarzameen Party (PSP) Mustafa Kamal also rejected the ECP fresh move and demanded it to review the decision. 
He said that Karachi and Hyderabad badly needed local bodies system to address daily life problems of the two cities through its elected representatives. 
“The fresh decision sounds more as a plan of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) which wants to occupy administrative control of Karachi and Hyderabad through different tactics,” he said.
“The first phase of local government elections in different parts of Sindh reflected how the PPP exploited its ruling position and won the majority despite losing popularity among the people of Sindh. The PPP knows that these tactics are hard to be implemented in major urban centres and that’s why it wants an escape from the elections from these cities.”
TLP rally from Numaish to ECP office
The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan, which is contesting from all Karachi and Hyderabad districts, also sounded in agreement with the opposition parties. The party protesting against the fresh decision took out a rally from Numaish to ECP office in the evening which was attended by party workers and supporters. 
In a statement it said that the ECP’s decision was “not acceptable at any cost” and it would take all due legal course to protest against the fresh move.

5,"Dua Zehra can’t be permitted to stay in Lahore on her own, SHC rules","Sessions court grants pre-arrest bail to Zaheer, his brother","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday observed that since Dua Zehra was still a minor and a key witness in the case, she cannot be permitted to stay on her own in Lahore till attaining maturity and disposal of the case.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro said that the Sindh police were at liberty to take the custody of girl from a shelter home in Lahore for her production before the trial court in Karachi after it was informed that efforts for shifting Dua were under way.
The bench stated that the court seized with the matter would decide about shifting Dua to any shelter home in Karachi at the time of her production before it.
It further noted that the girl was no more on good terms with her husband and did not want to live with him while she was also ostensibly afraid of her parents and not interested to live with them either and she had no place in Lahore to take shelter for the time being and decide about future.

Sessions court grants pre-arrest bail to Zaheer, his brother

The bench made these observations while deposing of a petition filed by Dua’s father seeking her recovery and custody.
The SHC in its order said that Dua was finding it hard to live with her husband and wary of purported threats by her parents and filed an application before a magistrate in Lahore, who sent her to a shelter home on July 19.
In view of such development, the petitioner’s lawyer pleaded for her shifting from a Darul Aman in Lahore to any Karachi shelter home as the case was pending investigation here.
The counsel for Dua’s purported husband Zaheer opposed the plea stating that the SHC had no jurisdiction to pass such an order as the same was likely to prejudice the right of his client on merits in the case.
The investigating officer of the case informed the bench that the Sindh home department had sent a letter to the Punjab home department on July 15 requesting for the recovery of the girl.
He added that efforts for her recovery and her shifting from Lahore to Karachi were under way and as soon as permission was granted, he would proceed to Lahore to seek her custody and produce her before the court seized with the matter or lodge her in a shelter home in Karachi. 
This stance of IO was also supported by the counsel appearing for the state.
The bench observed that the girl was no more on good terms with her husband and apparently afraid of her parents and not interested to reside with them. “But in any case, her living in Lahore does not seem to be in her benefit from any angle either, particularly after her separation from her husband, and is likely to cause hindrance in smooth proceedings of the case while her parents, who are her natural guardians are residing here, and the case and the trial court are situated in Karachi,” it added.
“She is still a minor and a main witness in the case is required to participate in its proceedings. Hence she cannot be permitted to be on her own in Lahore till she attains majority and the case is finally disposed of,” the bench in its order ruled.
“In such facts and circumstances, there appears to be no legal or otherwise impediment for this court in approving, and/or stopping the IO from performing his official duty and to seek, shifting of her custody from Darul Aman Lahore and her production before the trial court for the purpose of disposal or otherwise of the case and her lodgment in Panah Shelter Home, Darul Aman, Karachi or Shelter Home for Destitute & Orphan Children Sindh Karachi, as the case may be, to be decided by the court seized with the matter at the time of her production before it,” the SHC order stated.
Pre-arrest bail granted
A sessions court on Thursday granted interim pre-arrest bail to Zaheer Ahmed and his brother booked for allegedly kidnapping Dua from Karachi and solemnising her underage marriage in Punjab.
Police have booked Ahmed along with his around 20 relatives, including mother and brother for allegedly kidnapping 14-year-old Dua.
On Thursday, both Zaheer and Shabbir moved applications before Additional District and Sessions Judge (East) Rajesh Chandar Rajput to seek pre-arrest bail.
The judge granted interim bail before arrest to both the suspects subject to furnishing a surety of Rs100,000 each.
The judge directed them to join the investigation and fixed July 26 for confirmation or otherwise of their interim bail.
Earlier, defence counsel Aamir Riyaz submitted that his client, Zaheer, had obtained protective bail from the Lahore High Court’s Multan bench and wanted to join the investigation, but apprehended his arrest.

6,"Covid-19 ‘key reason’ behind inflammatory arthritis, say experts",KARACHI: Healthcare professionals and experts shared their recent experience on Wednesday which suggested that...,"KARACHI: Healthcare professionals and experts shared their recent experience on Wednesday which suggested that there’s an unprecedented increase in the complaints of muscle and joint pain reported by patients who recovered from Covid-19 in the country.
They also advised such patients to approach trained and qualified rheumatologists for the timely diagnosis and treatment for their conditions as the coronavirus had emerged as key reason behind inflammatory arthritis.
Speaking at the launching ceremony of the country’s first arthritis centre here from a group of health experts for the early diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and systemic autoimmune conditions, commonly referred as rheumatic diseases, they said that the fresh findings suggested that several complications emerged after the pandemic.
“Feeling the need for a dedicated arthritis treatment centre in Karachi, we have established this centre which will be serving patients from entire Sindh and Balochistan as well as South Punjab, who are unable to get proper treatment as most of the public and private health facilities lack the services of rheumatologists in this vast area,” said Dr Saliha Ishaq, Managing Director of the Pak-American Arthritis Centre at its the launching ceremony.
“We have a signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a local health group for the establishment of Pak-American Arthritis Centre (PAAC) where foreign and locally trained and qualified rheumatologists would be available for the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatic diseases, which are very common in Pakistan, but are hard to diagnose and treat by other health experts.”
Other leading rheumatologists, including Dr Tabe Rasool from the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS), Dr Tahira Perveen from Liaquat National Hospital, Dr Babar Saeed Khan, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ehad Medical Centre (EMC), Karachi, Dr Anam Dayem as well as dozens of health experts were also present on the occasion.
According to experts, rheumatoid arthritis, or RA, is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease, in which the immune system of a person attacks healthy cells in his or her body by mistake, causing inflammation (painful swelling) in the affected parts of the body. Rheumatoid Arthritis mainly attacks the joints, usually many joints at once.
Dr Saliha said they have signed the MoU with EMC which has over 20 branches throughout Karachi where trained and qualified rheumatologists would be available following the establishment of PAAC and added that network of the centre would be spread to other cities of Pakistan with the expansion of the medical centre in the country.
Speaking about burden of arthritis in Pakistan, Dr Saliha said around 3 per cent of Pakistani population is suffering from different autoimmune diseases as well as rheumatoid arthritis, but unfortunately, due to lack of trained and qualified rheumatologists in Pakistan, thousands of people, both young and old, are living with chronic pain for years without proper treatment and management.

She urged parents to raise voice against kidnapping of under-aged girls to protect them against forced marriages and said that parents must break taboos of society and need not to get afraid of raising voice if unfortunately their minor girls were kidnapped for forced marriage.
She was speaking to journalists at a ‘safe house’ for women in distress here on Thursday.
She said that according to parents of Umme Hania, she was just 11 years old and could not opt for a free-will marriage. They insisted hers was a case of kidnapping plain and simple, she said. 
She said that Pakistan United Legal Alliance had filed an application under Section 491 in the Hyderabad circuit bench of the Sindh High Court for the girl’s recovery.
She said that police should register FIRs under Child Marriage Acts in such cases but regretfully police role had not been observed as neutral and unbiased. Therefore, most of the time victim could not be saved in time due to police negligence, she said.
She said in answer to a question about Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s election victory in Punjab that morally speaking, PTI lost the election as its allegation that Election Commission of Pakistan was biased had proved wrong, she said. 
She claimed that Sindh government had executed record development works in the province and allocated Rs126 billion for development schemes in present budget. PTI could never win an election in Sindh, she said.
The minister also visited a safe house in Matiari and discussed issues of its management with the administration. 
She told journalists that safe houses for women in distress had been established in 20 districts of the province. Women would be kept here and provided protection as well as first aid facilities. Any woman in such cases would be kept in safe house for 48 hours before being produced before sessions judges concerned, she said.
She said that women would get legal advice from a non-governmental organisation. Com­plaint centres were also set up in safe houses where women could lodge their complaints. A helpline 1094 had been established by the department through which women could seek assistance, she said.
