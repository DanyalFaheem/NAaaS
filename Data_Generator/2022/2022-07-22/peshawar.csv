1,Court orders Nowshera police to register FIR in ‘missing person’ case,Family claims man taken into custody by police.,"PESHAWAR: A local court in Nowshera ordered the district police officer to register an FIR about disappearance of a man, whose family members claimed that he was taken into custody by police few days ago and since then his whereabouts were not known.
The additional district and sessions judge, Mohammad Asif, disposed of a petition filed by a woman, Ms Tasleema, who had challenged alleged illegal detention of her son Fazal Wahab.
A day earlier, the court had deputed a bailiff to search for the detainee at different police lock-ups as well as at offices of the police high-ups. However, the bailiff, Iqbal Shah, could not trace the detainee despite visiting several police lock-ups and offices of high-ups.
Advocate Syed Azizuddin Kakakhel appeared for the petitioner and stated that on July 11, Fazal Wahab along with his wife and a minor son was travelling on his motorcycle from his residence in Nowshera to Mardan to visit his sister.
He stated that the detainee was taken into custody by local police headed by Misri Banda police station SHO Rameen Khan without any legal justification.
The lawyer claimed that other sons of the petitioner approached police and they were told that their brother would be released soon. He added that even the petitioner and her sons gave food and clothes to police for the detainee.
However, he stated that on July 18 the SHO and other police officials categorically denied presence of detainee in their custody. He requested the court to order release of the detainee from the illegal confinement of the respondents including Nowsher DPO, Akora Khattak Circle DSP and the said SHO.
He claimed that the detainee had been kept at some secret place so that he could not be traced by the bailiff.
The judge quoted a judgment of Sindh High Court and ordered that in the light of the said judgment the DPO/SHO was directed to lodge an FIR of the cognisable case regarding the missing detainee Fazal Wahab.
The court observed that since the detainee had not been recovered by the bailiff of this court, therefore, in the peculiar circumstances and facts of the case the present petition had become infructuous.

Health dept starts testing of samples in Peshawar and Swat

The province, from January to July 20, has recorded 485,000 cases of diarrhoea including over 9,000 acute watery diarrhoea cases besides registering 21 cases of cholera.
Most cases were detected in 16 districts including Tank, Battagram, Peshawar, Mardan, Malakand, Swabi, Karak, Dir Lower, Swat, Nowshera, Haripur, Mansehra, Dera Ismail Khan, Dir Upper, Charsadda and Chitral.
A report said that cholera cases were confirmed after samples of suspected patients were tested in Public Health Reference Laboratory, Khyber Medical University (KMU) Peshawar and Saidu Group of Teaching Hospitals (SGTH), Swat. Both the laboratories tested 58 and 24 samples, respectively.
It said that 14 confirmed patients were less than 10-year-old while ratio of male and female patients stood at 75:25. Peshawar reported nine cases, Malakand five, Swat and Khyber three each and Kohat recorded a single case of cholera. It added that 85 per cent patients were admitted to hospitals and no death was recorded so far.

Physicians said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had not yet appropriately started surveillance by declaring sentinel sites and laboratories.
Health officials, however, told Dawn that they had started cholera tests in KMU and SGTH Swat with the supported of World Health Organisation and would soon notify those laboratories as sentinel labs for testing.

5,Two locals scale highest peak in Swat,"Sayyed Zeeshan Umer, Noman Khalil claim they were first to reach Falak Sar top without guides, porters, and equipment.","SWAT: Two local mountaineers scaled Falak Sar, the highest peak of the Hindukush mountain range in Swat (5,985 metres).
Sayyed Zeeshan Umer and Noman Khalil claimed that they were first to reach the top of the mountain, also known as Mini-K2, without guides, porters, and equipment.
Falak Sar, which means a peak touching the sky, is located in Ushu Matlitan valley of Swat.
Last month, a team comprising climbers from France, United Kingdom, Slavonia, United States and Gilgit-Baltistan scaled the peak and skied down from some part of it.
Mr Umer and Mr Khalil told Dawn that it was their dream to reach the peak and they did it without undergoing any formal training and having professional equipment.
They said they were proud to become the first mountaineers from Swat region to do so.
“We completed the expedition in six days. Our happiness knew no bounds when we reached the top. I dedicate this summit to my mother as she always encouraged me and prayed for my success,” Mr Umar said in a function held at the SPS College to welcome the two climbers after successful expedition.
The mountaineers said Falak Sar was not an easy peak as its route was full of icy and steep glaciers, dozens of wide crevasses, frequent vertical reliefs and enormous bulk of ice and rock, so it was one of the most dangerous peaks among 6,000 high peaks of the Hindukush mountain range.
“We are not professionally trained in rock and ice climbing, which was our weakest point. However, we had a strong will and found good weather, which enabled us to successfully climb the peak,” said Mr Khalil.
The two vowed to climb all highest peaks in the country but said that required professional training and equipment.
They said if the government or any private organisation supported them, they could fly the country’s flag atop those peaks.

9,Peshawar High Court asks govt to explain position on talks with TTP,Petition seeks court orders barring govt from making a deal with TTP without consultation of APS martyrs' parents.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday directed the federal government to respond to a petition seeking orders to stop it from making a deal with the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan without the consultation of parents of those killed in the 2014 Peshawar Army Public School attack.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Fazal Subhan issued the order after preliminary hearing into the petition filed by mothers of four students and a woman teacher assassinated by the TTP militants in the APS attack on Dec 16, 2014.
Advocate Ajoon Khan, whose son Asfand Khan was also killed in the massacre, appeared for the petitioners and said parents of the slain students and teachers were the victims of the most barbaric act of terrorism in the country’s history but they had still not been taken into confidence about the ongoing negotiations of the government with the proscribed TTP.
He requested the court to issue directives to the government not to take any step of reconciliation with the TTP without taking him and the petitioners on board.
The bench fixed July 28 for next hearing.
During previous hearing, the court had ordered the interior secretary to appear before it, but he didn’t turn up.
A joint secretary of the interior division informed the bench that the secretary had tested positive for coronavirus and therefore, he was absent from the hearing.
When asked by the court regarding the government-TTP parleys, the officer said he was not aware of any such dialogue.
Mr Ajoon wondered how it was possible, especially when a jirga was recently sent to Afghanistan to hold talks with the TTP militants and that was widely reported in the media.
Additional attorney general Aamir Jawed contended that the petition was not maintainable and was liable to be dismissed as a judicial commission had conducted an inquiry into the APS attack and the matter was pending with the Supreme Court.
Mr Ajoon contended that the matter pending with the apex court was altogether different from the one being considered by the high court. He said the Supreme Court had ordered an inquiry by a high court judge, who submitted a report to the former.
The lawyer argued that the petition was related to parleys between the TTP and the government, which was the latest development, and therefore, it was different from the one pending with the Supreme Court.
The AAG said the government had provided several incentives to the parents of the APS attack victims and had already met several of their demands.
Mr Ajoon said his clients had lost their children in the deadliest terrorist attack in the country and it was their right to know about the conditions on which the government was holding talks with the assassins.
The petitioners included Falak Naz, mother of students Noorullah and Saifullah, Shahana, mother of Asfand Khan, Seema, mother of Aimal Khan, and Zulaikha, mother of teacher Sadia Gul.
Lawyer Ajoon said his clients were the direct victims of the assassination of APS students and teachers by the TTP. The respondents in the petition are the defence ministry through its secretary, interior ministry through its secretary, federal government through law secretary, and focal person of the National Action Plan.
