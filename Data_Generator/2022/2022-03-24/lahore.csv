0,"P&D board report on IRMNCH: 1,000 pregnant women, 88,000 children died at BHUs, RHCs in Punjab in 2021",Report blasts programme launched by Punjab govt for its failure to prevent maternal and  neonatal deaths at healthcare facilities.,"LAHORE:  An official report has revealed that 1,000 pregnant women and more than  88,000 newborns and children under five years died at the basic health  units (BHUs) and rural health centres (RHCs) in Punjab during 2021,  showing the poor state of the rural-level health facilities and critical  healthcare issues of poor women and children.
The report prepared  by Punjab government’s Planning and Development Board on the Integrated   Reproductive Maternal Newborn, Child Health and Nutrition programme  (IRMNCH), also mentions that out of total 88,021 deaths of children at  the BHUs and RHCs, 62,813 were stillbirths.
“These are alarming  figures requiring immediate and serious attention of the project  [IRMNCH] team and other stakeholders,” the report suggests to the higher  authorities.
The programme was launched by the Punjab government  at the primary-level healthcare facilities to reduce maternal, newborn  and child morbidity and mortality, promote family planning services and  improve nutritional status of women and children.
The report  blasted the IRMNCH programme for its failure to prevent maternal and  neonatal deaths at the primary healthcare facilities, largely  functioning in the rural areas of Punjab.
These state-run  facilities are mostly visited by poor rural women for child delivery and  related medical issues as they don’t have immediate access to tehsil  and district headquarters hospitals. 
Sources says the report is  just based on the data collected from the RHCs and BHUs in all the 36  districts of the province, while such figures from other state-run  healthcare facilities are under process. The health experts fear that  the number of maternal and child deaths may rise manifold after the  processing of statistics gathered from other state-run healthcare  facilities.
The report says the data analysis showed that a total  of 624,752 normal deliveries (with a monthly average of 34 deliveries  per RHC/BHU) were conducted at the RHCs and BHUs in Punjab during 2021.
“1,000  maternal deaths were reported to the IRMNCH programme in 2021, that is  quite a high figure considering the public health significance and  sensitivity of this issue,” reads the report.
It says such a high  number of maternal deaths shows there are some gaps in service delivery  of the programme at these facilities (BHU, RHC) and the community level  (Lady Health Workers network across Punjab) which needs to be identified  to improve the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) figures.
Similarly,  a total 25,208 deaths of under-five children were reported to IRMNCH  programme in Punjab during 2021. “These included 13,706 neonatal, 8,045  infant and 3,457 under-5 children’s deaths,” the report said.  
In  addition to these deaths, a total of 62,813 stillbirths were also  reported in Punjab during 2021. Showing flaws in the nutrition programme  of the IRMNCH, the report cites data of the Government Sabzazar  Hospital, Lahore where a total 1,439 children under five years were  identified as Severe Acute Malnourished (SAM) at its OPD in 2021. “Of  them, only 138 were admitted to the Stabilisation Centre for acute care  and management of SAM,” reads the report.
The nutrition programme  was supposed to provide ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) and Multi  Micro nutrient Sachets (MMS) for underweight children (6 months – 2  years of age), and F-75 (used to prevent death) and F-100 for treatment  of SAM children admitted to the stabilisation centres.
“However,  it was reported by the hospital medical staff that the supply of these  nutrition supplements was not regular during the last one year that  affected the management and treatment of the malnourished children,” the  report says.
The report shows that there is a dire need to  improve the quality of services, both at the health facilities and the  community level under the IRMNCH and its nutrition programme across the  province.

1,"PTI has fallen like a house of cards, says Marriyum","“The only cards the selected premier is holding onto are jokers,"" the PML-N spokesperson says.","LAHORE: PML-N information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb has dubbed Prime Minister Imran Khan “captain inflation” saying his entire party has fallen like a house of cards while he is boasting about holding the best card to be shown later.
“The only cards the selected premier is holding onto are jokers. The last card and surprise he is talking of is his resignation,” Ms Auranzeb said on Wednesday in a statement.  
She said the prime minister had been ‘clean-bowled’ and was continuing with his rant because of being a loser. She said the selected premier’s fear and obsession with PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif would not end and he would keep calling his name in paranoia even after he was kicked out of the prime minister’s office.
Marriyum Auranzeb asked Imran Khan to stop his ‘aggression’ against the constitution and the people of Pakistan.  
“Khan gave Pakistanis surprises of inflation, unemployment, looting and lies. The ‘captain inflation’ knows that he can only win in a match where he has to lie and not in the no-confidence vote.”

2,Marriage hall sealed after ghastly incident,Police have arrested 12 suspects and the owner of the hall; official says there were no torture marks on the victim's body.,"KASUR: The Pattoki tehsil administration on Wednesday sealed the marriage hall where some guests at a function allegedly tortured a rice cracker vendor to death suspecting him to be a pickpocket.  
The incident drew public ire when video clips of the wedding guests relishing the dinner close to the body of the vendor went viral.  
Police had already arrested 12 suspects and the hall owner. They did not seek remand of the suspects for not putting their arrest in the record, a police official told Dawn.  
Pattoki circle DSP Asif Hanif said police had not received any video showing torture of Ashraf. He said the incident was shrouded in mystery and police had already arrested 12 suspects and would not make any more  arrest without having concrete evidence of lynching and  forensic report confirming the cause of the death. 
He further said there were no torture marks on the body of the victim. What’s a matter of alarm, he said, was the callousness which people displayed as shown in the video clips. 
On Monday, guests at a function allegedly lynched a vendor who died on the spot, dragged his body into the hall and later had their dinner.

5,Taha’s buses and Jinnah’s wish for a modern Lahore,"On the 2nd of September 1951, the very first fleet of six Leyland double-decker buses were lined up outside the...","On the 2nd of September 1951, the very first fleet of six Leyland double-decker buses were lined up outside the Punjab Assembly. The province’s first Chief Minister, Mian Mumtaz Daultana, was impressed and gave the go-ahead to make as many more as possible.
This nod for this expansion brought about a massive change in the urban life of Lahore, and solved a growing transportation problem. It is amazing how over the last 70 years our transport problems have grown, ultimately to crash, and then transportation simply disappeared. The situation today defies every transport economist, engineer and planner, let alone the citizens of this ancient city, who have an amazing ability to find simple cheap solutions.
These double-decker buses were set up by a gentleman named Zulfiqar Taha, a former London bus driver, who studied and became an automobile engineer, and finally a transport planner. So from top to bottom he understood urban transportation. He returned to British India, set up the Srinagar bus service, then came to Amritsar and set up a new bus system there, and after 1947 came to Lahore.  
Once Pakistan came into being, Mr. M.A. Jinnah wished that Lahore be a modern city with an efficient transportation system. He ordered the setting up of the Lahore Omnibus Service – the LOS - and assigned Taha to solve this problem. As the country faced a financial crunch – as it still does – Mr Jinnah discussed the issue with Zulfiqar Taha who suggested a mix of double-decker and single-decker buses, depending on their route and passenger density, but insisted that Pakistan only import the chassis and engines fitted on them. The rest, he assured the Father of the Nation: “our boys are capable enough to build the rest”. That still more than holds true.
So it was that the LOS plan unfolded at the Ferozepur Road bus depot and within six months of the chassis arriving the first buses were ready. Very soon the LOS double-decker became a symbol of a modern Lahore. Amazingly the LOS started generating impressive profits and the bus company had huge reserves to import still more new chassis and engine sets. But then fate takes strange twists in Pakistan. Come 1958 and the military took over the country and very soon we see Mr Taha being replaced by an army officer. Soon one learnt that a loan had been provided by the LOS to the armed service. The collapse had truly started.
Over time bus production was halted as “a waste of foreign reserves” and the old buses started to rust as replacement parts dried up and by the time Mr. Z. A. Bhutto came to power in 1971 after the East Pakistan debacle, the LOS had virtually ceased to exist. Rusting buses filled the yards. It was a sort of national tragedy. It then dawned on the PPP government that people had started complaining about not having any transport system. They still do. This saw the entry of the auto-rickshaw, which coupled with old Morris Minor taxis with meters started to fill in the gap, but not for the poor.
But the ‘transport gap’ was simply growing and as the city expanded and distances between homes and workplaces increased, transport costs soared. Mr Bhutto moved fast and imported complete buses from Sweden. They did manage, partially, to fill in a small-term gap. But then again because of spares and an incompetent transport bureaucracy even these spanking Volvo buses started to rust. Within three years the stop-gap arrangement came to a grinding halt.
The private sector moved in to fill in the opportunity and Lahore was soon filled up with used minibuses and wagons. Undisciplined as their operation was, it must go to their credit that they managed to get the population at reasonable costs from one place to another. But even these ‘devils on the road’ could not make up for the missing transport system, especially with the population now growing annually in double figures.
Now enter the lethal motorcycle. This came with the introduction of Japanese local production, and soon Lahore had a fast and efficient method of moving from one place to another. Today Lahore has more motorcycles then all other systems combined anywhere in the world. Here let me introduce some official statistics. The Punjab Police website tells us that Lahore has almost two motorcycles for every household of seven persons on the average. This stands out as the highest ratio in the world.
So many motorcycles, and the sheer indiscipline of their mostly young underage riders, has created a major traffic hazard. It has also led to the banning of Basant, because the police has informed the government that they cannot control young daredevil ‘helmetless’ drivers. A few years ago the Mayor of the Brazilian city of Rio de Janeiro came to Lahore and shared their common ‘motorcycle problem’. His recommendations have been put in the cold storage, like a lot of other suggestion experts make.
Among the suggestions were a control on the number of motorcycles manufactured, as well as other methods to reduce numbers. But then Rio put in place an excellent rail and bus service and their transportation problems are almost over. Almost three years ago a group of Pakistani scholars in Cambridge picked up the Zulfiqar Taha route as a method of bringing back the double and single decker buses in large numbers.
The financial package designed by these scholars was through a private bank-government guarantee route. This meant a minimum of investment. It meant that for every down-payment for a bus by an entrepreneur, within four year he would be able to double his money, plus earn from the bus operation, plus thanks to financial depreciation, manage to get back the cost of the whole bus within four years. After this period the bus would belong to the government, or the new LOS. The response from bureaucrats was predictable. “Not workable” they said. End of plan. That plan had a target of introducing almost 500 buses a year.
Now let me put in perspective the gap by comparing Lahore to London to understand the massive need. The population of London in February 2022, is 9,541,000. The city has 8,600 buses operating on 700 routes serving 19,000 bus stops. London also has an Underground Tube Train service with 11 lines covering 402 kms covering 242 stations and transporting five million passengers with 543 trains. Surely this is a model worth following. It will take time, but it is certainly achievable.
The solution surely lies in following the plan set forth by Zulfiqar Taha, as instructed by the Quaid-i-Azam. Today all we have to do is import the engines, build the chassis within Pakistan – times have changed - and the body can very easily be handled by the scores of bus bodybuilding firms. It is being done in India. Surely once we overcome our patriotic fervour a little co-operation would be useful.
Let private parties invest Rs10 million per bus, and the rest they should get from a bank with a government bank guarantee. Let them run the service and within three years get their money back. Let them also keep the profit and provide the government Rs3 per passenger. The bus design and colour should be officially approved.
At this stage building a Tube Train is not possible. But then planning one is possible. After all the London service was started by the private sector. The possibilities are all there in hundreds of proposals presented by well-meaning Pakistani entrepreneurs. Sadly, the cold storage in the Lahore Civil Secretariat surely must be massive.

The event to mark their death anniversaries was organised under the auspices of the Bhagat Singh Memorial Foundation Pakistan. 
On the occasion, the foundation adopted a resolution demanding the British Queen to visit Shadman Chowk, like she had visited the Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar (India) and apologised for the 1919 massacre.  
The Queen should also apologise to Pakistan and India and the families of the three revolutionaries and pay them a huge compensation, it demanded. 
The foundation asked the Indian premier to posthumously award India’s highest civil award to the three revolutionary leaders.  
It also demanded that the Hussainiwala Border with India should also be opened immediately for the Pakistani citizens.  
“Similarly, Prime Minister Imran Khan should announce the country’s highest civil award to Bhagat Singh and issue commemorative stamps and coins to honour him. A major road in the country should also be named after him [Bhagat] and include [lessons about] his courage and bravery in the curriculum,” it demanded. 
Foundation Chairman Imtiaz Rasheed Qureshi, lawyers Manzoor Gilani, Raja Zulqernain, Mian Saeed, M.H Shaheen, Kashif Mahmood and Haider Farooq Maududi spoke on the occasion.

7,Induction into PSP: IGP seeks ‘unquestioned obedience’ by provincial officers,LAHORE: IGP Rao Sardar Ali Khan has recommended to the Establishment Division to abolish the condition of...,"LAHORE: IGP Rao Sardar Ali Khan has recommended to the Establishment Division to abolish the condition of “willingness or unwillingness” for the induction of 42 police officers of the province into the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP).  
The IGP sent the request to the ED, Islamabad, when the latter raised issue with the Punjab government that nearly half of the 42 police officers recommended by the provincial police have shown their “unwillingness” to join the PSP cadre.  
Earlier, the Punjab government on the recommendations of the Central Police Office (CPO) had forwarded cases of 44 provincial police officers to the ED to induct them into the PSP last year. In response to the government’s request, the ED through a letter issued on Aug 6, 2021 asked Punjab to furnish three kinds of documents to process the case.  
The documents demanded by the ED were regarding minutes of the Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) meeting regarding promotion of the officers on the panel to BS-18, No National Reconciliation Order (NRO) beneficiary certificate and the willingness of the officers. The Punjab government completed the documents and sent these to the ED on Aug 10. 
The establishment division found out that 22 of the 42 provincial service officers re-sent by the Punjab government have refused to be part of the PSP.  
An officer said most provincial police officers had declared the Punjab police department’s move of their induction into the PSP cadre a ‘trick’ to surrender their services to the federal government to create a vacuum for the officers to hold top slots in Punjab. He said the provincial service police officers feared that the process would affect their seniority as most of them had served for more than 25 years in the police department. 
“The induction of the highly experienced provincial service officers into PSP means they would work under ‘young assistant superintendents of police (ASPs)’ and it would be sheer violation of rights,” the officer said.  
He said some of the affected officers had also moved court and managed to get stay against the move of the Punjab police department. “If a provincial police officer has shown his unwillingness for being part of PSP, how can the department force him,” he said and added that it’s against the spirit of the job contract.  
Meanwhile, of the 44 officers, he said, two officers retired while the case of 42 officers was under process at the Establishment Division.  
The letter issued by the IGP reads: “The requisite information/documents were furnished to your office on Aug 10, 2021 accordingly.” 
“In response, your office forwarded a letter of the establishment division written on Oct 7, 2021 wherein guidance pertaining to willingness of officers for their encadrement into PSP cadre was provided as reproduced hereunder:  
“Willingness of officers being considered for encadrement is not mandatory as appointment in PSP is made in terms of Rule 7 of the Police Service of Pakistan (Composition, Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985 which requires only approval/recommendations of Governor”.  
Furthermore, the letter said, the Rule 7 provides that; “Members of the Police Cadre of a Province shall be appointed to a Service on the basis of selection made on the recommendation of the Governor: Provided that appointment of members of the police cadre of a Province under this rule shall not exceed 40 % of the senior cadre posts in that province as notified in the schedule”.  
Since in the purview of above reproduced advice/guideline by the ED Islamabad, the letter said, the willingness/unwillingness of officers has lost its weight or maintainability.  
“Therefore, this office memo issued on Aug 10, 2021 regarding “willingness” or “unwillingness” of the officers for their induction into PSP is hereby withdrawn accordingly,” says the letter.

“The ruling party should give up its resistance to the use of the constitutional right of the opposition parties to complete peacefully the process of no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan and avoid inviting party workers to the federal capital to threaten PTI MNAs feared to be voting against the party policy,” said Tehrik-i-Istaqlal President Rehmat Khan Wardag at a press conference here on Wednesday. 
The peaceful completion of the no-trust process would help promote democratic values in the country, he said, cautioning the prime minister that he would be directly responsible for the bloodshed as a result of the chaos to be created due to public meetings of the ruling and opposition on the same day in Islamabad.
He asserted that by abusing their political rivals the PTI ministers and leaders were damaging their party itself.
He said going by the language Imran Khan was using in his public meetings one could say that the prime minister had decided to “invite martial law if I am ousted from power” but, he said, it was his ‘immature’ thinking.
Mr Wardag condemned the attack on the Sindh House in Islamabad the other day and criticised the role of the federal capital’s administration and police in the episode. Terming the attack on Sindh house as the attack on the province, he opposed attempts to corner the Pakistan People’s Party saying as far as the PPP was there in Sindh none could think of the success of separatists there.
