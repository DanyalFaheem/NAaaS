0,Family blames Taxila hospital staff for infant’s death,"Urge Punjab chief minister, health minister and Rawalpindi DC to order an inquiry.","TAXILA: The family of a newborn baby has accused doctors of negligence in provision of treatment which led to his death.
Abdul Ghafoor, a resident of Mohallah Mashraqiabad, told journalists on Tuesday that he took his daughter-in-law to Tehsil Headquarters (THQ) Hospital after she went into labour, adding that the child was delivered normally. However, the doctor on duty asked them to take the newborn to Holy Family Hospital (HFH) in Rawalpindi as the child’s heartbeat was abnormal.
He said he asked the medical staff to let him take his baby to HFH himself but the hospital management told him that the baby needed oxygen support which would be provided to him in the ambulance. However, he alleged that the ambulance did not have an oxygen cylinder facility and when it reached Rawalpindi, the baby was pronounced dead.
Quoting the doctor, Mr Ghafoor said the baby required immediate oxygen support which was not available in the hospital. He said the death certificate mentioned heart failure as the cause of death.
He was of the view that if doctors had provided the baby oxygen in the hospital or an ambulance that had an oxygen facility, his life could have been saved.
He urged Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, Punjab Health Minister Dr Yasmeen Rashid and Deputy Commissioner Rawalpindi Tahir Farooq to order a probe into the incident and take necessary action against the medical staff of the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital for its negligence and indifferent attitude.
When contacted, Deputy District Officer Dr Sara Qadeer while confirming the incident said that the issue is in the notice of local health authorities, adding that the tragic incident is being investigated and findings would be shared with the media.
Responding to a question, she said if the health officials concerned were found guilty of negligence, they would be dealt with as per law.

Mr Abbasi was addressing participants of the Gulf Information Security Expo and Conference (GISEC) 2022 held in Dubai. He referred to a recent study carried out by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), pointing out that 95pc of cyber security breaches were perpetrated due to human errors.
“It has been observed that if human error was eliminated or contained to an extent, 19 out of 20 cyber breaches would not have taken place,” the DG FIA said while referring to his long experience in the field of law enforcement.
He said there was a need to counter cyber attacks and protect organisations from cyber infiltrations, and apart from installation of relevant technologies there was need to upgrade relevant human resource too.
Mr Abbasi said: “Organisations must adopt tangible measures to address the element of human error, and build a cyber workforce, capable of rising up to the challenge of cyber security through recruitment of cyber security experts.”
Furthermore, he said the estimated cost of cyber offences in organisations globally was $400 billion and 95pc of data breaches were attributed to human negligence.
The GISEC is the region’s most established and influential cyber security exhibition and conference which truly represents the Arab world.

4,‘TB-infected person infects around 15 others every year’,"ISLAMABAD: A person with infectious Tuberculosis (TB)infects 10 to 15 other people on an average every year, if not...","ISLAMABAD: A person with infectious Tuberculosis (TB)infects 10 to 15 other people on an average every year, if not treated well.
Similarly, a person who takes TB medicines regularly, stops infecting others in about two weeks which is why awareness about the disease must be created.
This was pointed out by media coordinator at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) Dr Waseem Khawaja ahead of World TB Day which is being observed all over the world today (Thursday).
“Every person with symptoms of the disease should get tested in the hospital, Dr Khawaja said, adding that Pims treated over 4,000 TB patients every year.
“A patient with TB spreads the infection through coughing, sneezing, laughing loud and spitting. Women who take TB drugs can continue to breastfeed their babies. A person with TB can be treated completely within eight months,” he said.
TB is a curable disease and the government is providing free-of-cost treatment for it throughout the country. Pakistan is ranked fifth among countries with the highest incidence of TB in the world with over 44,000 people dying of it every year. The country accounts for 60pc of the TB burden of the eastern Mediterranean region of the World Health Organisation (WHO) comprising 22 countries. The country is ranked fourth in terms of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, which is the most difficult to handle and has become a major challenge for the health sector.
Talking to Dawn, TB Control Programme Deputy National Coordinator Abdul Wali Khansaid according to estimates over 570,000 new cases, including 26,000 drug-resistant ones, emerge every year and were added to the prevalent pool of cases, out of which nearly a third were missed while the rest were treated and cured.
“MDR TB is the one which grows when patients stop taking medicines without completion of course. We register patients and try to ensure that every registered patient should complete his or her course. Unfortunately, TB is a stigma in the country so people try to hide their disease and get treatment done privately, due to which so many times they miss the courses of medicines. We are not only treating them but a programme has been made to provide financial support to such patients,” he said.
It is the first time that provincial TB control programmes are efficiently making effort to control the disease, he said, adding that, “though, the cure rate is over 95pc in Pakistan, unfortunately around 150,000 cases are not reported at all which means that the patients either do not go to the hospital or they get treated privately.”
“In 2020, a dip in registered cases was observed when around 230,000 patients were registered but this year 342,000 cases have been registered. Despite Covid-19, we have ensured uninterrupted supply of medicines due to which the Global Fund has praised our performance. Last year in December, we established an Advisory Group, in which prominent health experts were included. We will disseminate the guideline soon,” he said.
Spokesperson for Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) Sajid Shah, while talking to Dawn, said the government had merged TB, AIDS and malaria programmes to get maximum results, adding that efforts were being made to eradicate the disease by 2030 as it was one of the major challenges for the health sector.
In January this year, President Dr Arif Alvi said there was a need to create awareness among people to end taboos associated with TB.
While speaking at the ‘End TB Summit’ held at the Aiwan-i-Sadr, he had pointed out that around 350,000 cases connected with TB had been detected across the country on a yearly basis and there was need to work together to bring this number down.
Dr Alvi said that the country had an advantageous edge to fight against TB after gaining valuable experience in containing the Covid-19 pandemic, adding there is a need to create awareness among people that TB is a curable disease so that those who suffer from it can be traced and treated.

Station House Officer (SHO) Wajahat Kazmi confirmed to Dawn that Faizullah and Yousuf, residents of Ugi Battagram, were digging along the house of Manzoor Shah in Taami Gojra neighbourhood, which triggered a landslide in the adjacent mountain. Local residents, who were later joined by Rescue 1122 personnel, launched a rescue operation and retrieved their bodies after an effort of almost two hours.
Both bodies were later dispatched to their native area, SHO Kazmi said.
Expressing grief over the loss of lives, civil society activists said that government departments had turned a blind eye towards illegal cutting of mountain slopes in different neighbourhoods, notwithstanding the threat, the unlawful practice posed to the lives of labourers and passers-by.
“Influential people excavate mountain slopes with impunity to carve out residential and commercial plots even along main arteries, let alone less visited areas, but none among the government functionaries stops this unlawful practice fraught with threats not only to human beings but also the environment,” said Saeed Shah, a civil society activist.

10,Project to mitigate contamination in Rawal Dam in doldrums,CDA officials write to interior ministry to take up matter with Planning Commission.,"• CDA officials write to interior ministry to take up matter with Planning Commission
• Civic body mulling for re-tendering, spokesperson says
ISLAMABAD: A project of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) under which sewage treatment plants (STPs) were to be installed in the catchment areas of Rawal Dam is in doldrums after the validity of the financial bid expired.
The CDA had opened financial bids of the environmentally-friendly project in June last year, which aimed at eradicating contamination from Rawal Dam.
According to the plan, the plants were to be set up in lower Shahdara, Bari Imam and near Banigala as in their absence, Rawal Dam receives untreated sewage from unplanned localities in the catchment areas.
The tentative cost of the project is Rs3.9 billion which is to be shared by the federal and Punjab governments under 64 and 36pc ratio, respectively.
The CDA officials said the PC-I was prepared on the direction of the Planning Commission as an Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) mode project, which meant that its design and engineering were to be handled by an EPC contractor.
They said after awarding tender, the civic body was supposed to get approval of the revised PC-I from the Planning Commission. However, an objection was raised by the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), which stated that the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project had not been carried out.
As a result, the PC-I was approved after much delay, but in the process, the bid’s validity period expired last year.
“Due to the objection raised by Pak-EPA on the environment impact assessment, we were unable to give a go-ahead to the contractor and in the meantime the bid’s validity period expired. Now, we are mulling for re-tendering,” CDA spokesperson Syed Asif Raza said.
Recently, the CDA had requested the interior ministry to take up this issue with the Planning Commission.
In his letter, the member engineering informed the interior ministry that the bid validity had already expired, proposing that either the CDA be allowed to execute the project or tenders be called on EPC mode with the condition that the EIA be delayed till the contractor was on board.
The CDA member, in his letter, also explained the reasons behind the expiry of the bid’s validity.
The letter stated that the project was approved by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) in November 2019 at a cost of Rs3971.3 million with directions to execute the project on EPC mode.
“The Planning Commission further directed to come back to CDWP after tendering the same on special EPC mode for cost approval. Subsequently, the CDA was given a go-ahead by the Planning Commission/CDWP along with the respective budgetary support for implementing the project,” read the letter, adding that the project was tendered by CDA and the PC-I was revised and placed before the planning authorities for cost approval.
“Unfortunately at the time of approval, the requirement of EIA was raised by Pak-EPA and the entire bidding process was abandoned.
Pak-EPA was part of the entire approving process and such requirements were never raised before by it (project itself meant to mitigate environmental pollution),” read the letter.
Thereafter, the member said several meetings were held with the Pak-EPA director general and they were requested time and again to delay the EIA approval till the EPC contractor was on board as EIA was to be based on the design that would be made by the EPC contractor.
EPA is also reluctant to consider the STP-I located near Bari Imam on the plea that the area is encroached upon by locals, the letter stated, adding that the Planning Commission had been requested to consider the project keeping in view hyper-inflation including expiry of the bid validity period due to abnormal delays related to approval of the revised PC-I. However, the CDA could not get approval of the revised PC-I.
The completion time of the STPs is 14 months and they will treat around 9.6 million gallons daily (MGD).

Addressing a workers convention organised by PML-N Punjab chapter in Ahata near Taxila he said no-confidence was their democratic and constitutional right.
He said the speaker should have convened the session on March 22, but he violated the constitution by convening the session on March 25. He should now face trial under Article 6, the PML-N leader added.
He accused the PTI government of harassing its political rivals through National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
Mr Iqbal said the government was trying to silent every voice being raised against its incompetence.
He was of the view that the country was in the grip of unprecedented chaos .
He alleged that the incumbent government had no regard for constitution, democratic values and parliament. He urged the Supreme Court to take a suo motu notice of statements given by the government ministers.
PML-N Punjab President Rana Sanaullah in his address claimed that the container politics had come to an end.
He urged the PML-N office bearers at provincial, divisional and district levels to bring party workers from across the country to the long march. 
He said the march was due to be held on March 26 but had now been rescheduled for March 28 due to the National 
Assembly session and hearing in the Supreme Court.
He said that during his two terms as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif strived to make the country one of the developed countries .
He said that in 1998 when neighbouring India conducted nuclear test, Pakistan detonated eight nuclear warheads as compared to five in India under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif.
He said under the current circumstances, it would be better for Prime Minister Imran Khan to resign as he had lost majority in the house.
Former deputy speaker of the National Assembly Murtaza Javaid Abbasi in his address said Prime Minister Imran Khan’s days were numbered as he would not survive the no-trust motion.
He was of the view that due to massive corruption, unemployment, inflation and price hike, the no-trust move was the demand of the people.

In a letter to the delegates, JI asked the OIC members to differentiate between terrorism and the right to struggle for freedom.
The letter said that the extremists’ government in India was trying to impose the Hindutva ideology in the IIOJK after unilaterally abrogating the special status of that place in the Indian constitution.
The letter signed by JI emir Sirajul Haq expressed concern over the gross human rights violations in India, persecution of the religious minorities particularly in the occupied state of Jammu and Kashmir.
“Under these circumstances the people of Pakistan rest their hopes in the OIC meeting that it will take notice of the barbaric actions of Indian government in IIOJK,” the letter said.

The letter also mentioned that during the Russia – Ukraine conflict both sides were recruiting international volunteers and calling it a movement for freedom.
