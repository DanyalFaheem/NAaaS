0,RED ZONE FILES: All eyes on the allies,The next seven days will make it crystal clear whether PM Imran stays in office or is forced to trade places with Shehbaz Sharif.,"We are into the final stretch and the situation is not looking peachy for the PTI government. 
The ingredients flavouring this political brew are numerous: vocal dissidents, a partisan speaker, unrestrained spokespersons, active courts, and of course, the allies. Ah, those petulant and cryptic allies and their mind games — they could be the death of the government. Literally. 
When all sides are claiming to hold trump cards, it is these allies that are, in fact, the real trump cards. So how will they play themselves? 
The answer is giving sleepless nights to the ruling party and its supporters. The allies, PML-Q, MQM and BAP, stand between the government and the deep political abyss. They step back, and bam! It’s all over for Prime Minister Imran Khan and the merry men and women of his cabinet. But the pesky allies are being oh-so-elusive in their quest for self-advantage. It is almost as if, after years of being taken for granted, they are now relishing being wooed by all and sundry. See their smug expressions, hear their quasi-triumphant words and sense their barely-disguised glee; this is what it looks like when you can have your cake and eat it too. 
Read: Reports of allies switching sides send govt into frenzy 
For now, however, the cake sits pretty inside the political fridge. There will be a time to wolf it down — icing and all — but that time is not here yet. Not perhaps for another day. Or two. Or even three. What’s the rush when we know where we are heading, the allies seem to be asking the cosmos in general. Yes, there is this huge suspense about which side they will choose to support, and yes there is also their evasiveness wrapped in painfully delicious ambiguity — but… 
Well, not really. 
It is the Red Zone’s worst kept secret that the allies are all set to plunge the dagger in PTI’s back — and twist it. ‘Tis March and the season of daggers, in any case. This theatre will play itself out through various political, legal and judicial scenes and acts, but the final chapter is as good as written, say insiders. Now that the OIC meeting is over and done with, and the March 23 parade has also marched itself back into the barracks, the gladiatorial games are set to resume in the federal capital from today. The next seven days will make it crystal clear whether PM Khan stays in office or is forced to trade places with Mian Shehbaz Sharif. 
The following five factors may help bring the next seven days in perspective: 
1. The Speaker Asad Qaisar has summoned the National Assembly on Friday March 25, which means that technically the opposition can move the motion of the vote of no-confidence on this day. However, if the speaker does not allow this and adjourns the session for the following week, the timelines for the vote will get extended. There will be a legal tussle over this, but insiders say it is highly unlikely that the speaker can delay the vote for too long. It is now a matter of days, even if the days extend a few days beyond the expected date of March 28 for the vote. 
2. The PTI government has started to come to terms with the fact that they now only have a slim chance of winning the vote. This reluctant acknowledgement of the reality is evidenced in their statements that are now focusing more on the March 27 public rally and less on the actual vote of no-confidence on the floor of the house. The realisation is also manifesting itself in the PTI’s lackluster outreach to the allies and its disgruntled members. The presidential reference to the Supreme Court is a last-ditch effort to be seen as doing something, anything, but it cannot compensate for nearly two years of the ruling party’s political mismanagement and maltreatment of many electables in the Punjab. Nor can it dilute the harsh impact of the overall misrule in the country’s largest province – misrule that is one of the root causes of the great unrest within the establishment, the allies and among a large group of PTI members. 
3. The opposition is also mulling another scenario, according to Red Zone insiders. If the allies come on board, the opposition will easily cross the magic number of 172 without needing the vote of the PTI’s disgruntled members. The option under consideration is then not to have these disgruntled members cross the floor to vote. This way they do not get disqualified and remain with the PTI on the opposition benches but as a ‘forward bloc’. The final decision would be made after the announcement by the allies. 
4. Faced with this grim situation, the PTI has the following options for the next few days before the vote: (i) De-notify a powerful office holder. This would trigger a massive controversy but does not really help the PTI avert the impending loss in the vote of no-confidence (ii) Remove Usman Buzdar as CM Punjab and appoint someone acceptable to the Tareen group and the establishment. This would not win back the PML-Q and therefore the numbers game in Islamabad will not be affected (iii) Offer early elections as a compromise solution. It is too late for this and the PM remains in a combative, no-compromise mode as reflected in his conversation with reporters on Wednesday (iv) Convert the March 27 party rally in Islamabad into the grand finale of his stint in power, unveil a new post-ouster narrative, spell out the plan of action for the coming weeks as the opposition, and galvanise the party base for a fresh countrywide aggressive campaign. This may be useful as a political strategy but it is an acknowledgement that the PM has run out of options to stay in power. 
5. If the rallies of both PTI and the opposition take place on March 27, turbulence cannot be ruled out. However, even in the worst case scenario in which a serious law and order problem arises, it is unlikely that the vote of no-confidence would be swept aside. That constitutional procedure will have to move ahead and deliver an outcome. 
Buckle up for the next seven days.

1,"Institutions heartily backing democracy, says President Alvi","Chinese, OIC officials witness Pakistan Day event; troops from friendly countries also take part.","ISLAMABAD: President Arif Alvi has said national institutions are wholeheartedly backing democracy in Pakistan, declaring that the nation and all institutions want stability of democracy and rule of law, as they believe in it 
“This [approach of the institutions] is the path to stability and development,” said President Alvi at the Joint Services Parade, the highlight of the ceremonies held across the country to mark 82nd Pakistan Day, in the federal capital on Wednesday. 
The parade featured marching troops, military assets, including the recently acquired J-10C fighter aircraft, and cultural floats. This year’s annual event attained great significance as foreign ministers of the 57-member OIC as well as Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi witnessed the joint services parade along with Prime Minister Imran Khan, cabinet members, diplomats, senior civil and military officials and some prominent figures who have won accolades for their services to Pakistan.

In his address, President Alvi noted that Pakistan was faced with the challenges of extremism, intolerance, population growth, women rights and fake news. He called on all segments of society, especially the clergy, media, parents and students, to help in tackling these issues. 
Recalling the national resolve to safeguard independence and sovereignty, he said a lot of sacrifices had been rendered and no compromises would be made in future. “We fought wars, defeated terrorism, and thwarted internal and external conspiracies,” he asserted.
Dr Alvi said Pakistan was a responsible nuclear state that wanted peace with all, respected sovereignty of other countries and believed in peaceful co-existence. 
However, he pointed out that India’s expansionist designs and illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir were the major cause of instability in the region, asking the UN to stop the human rights violations by India in the occupied valley and calling for implementing the UN resolutions on Kashmir. 
He said major challenges faced by the Muslim world included Palestine and Kashmir disputes, the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and the rising tide of Islamophobia. “All these challenges could be dealt with through unity,” he advised the foreign delegates, stating that Pakistan wants the international organisation representing the Muslim world to be more effective. 
The event at Islamabad’s Parade Avenue commenced with Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu leading the fly-past of various formations of Pakistan Air Force fighter jets. including the newly acquired J-10C. Contingents of army, navy, air force, SSG, FC, Pakistan Rangers, Coast Guards and Islamabad police marched past the dais presenting salute to the chief guest. The marching columns of Armoured Corps, Artillery, Air Defence, besides infantry regiments and the women contingent of AFNS, were also highlight of the day-long event, adds APP.

Cultural floats
A special float of OIC member states was also showcased on the occasion, besides the cultural floats presenting artifacts, folk songs and dances in a show of national harmony. 
Also, the Sherdil team of seven Karakoram aircraft presented enthralling aerobatics, leaving a colourful trail of smoke in the blue sky. The paratroopers of the three services made freefall jumps from the altitude of 10,000 feet and precisely landed at their designated targets in the ground. 
Stars of the event
After the parade review, distinguished personalities, who were especially invited to the Pakistan Day event, were showered with praise for their meritorious services to the nation.

3,No Covid deaths for the first time in two years,"Health expert says virus still has potential to spread, advises citizens to not take it lightly.","ISLAMABAD: The country on Wednesday reported zero Covid-19 deaths, the first time since April 1, 2020 that a day has passed without such an incident. The first death in the country from coronavirus was reported on March 20, 2020, in Sindh  
According to data of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) released on Wednesday, 443 more coronavirus infections were reported over the past 24 hours, but there was not a single death related to Covid-19. 
The data further showed that although a number of times a single death had been reported in Pakistan, since April 1, 2020, zero mortality had never been the case. The national positivity rate, according to the data, was 1.28 per cent. 

NCOC data shows 443 new cases 

Vice Chancellor of University of Health Sciences Prof Dr Javed Akram said that although the virulence of virus had become reduced, it still had the potential to spread and the people should not take it lightly. 
Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar also announced the development on his Twitter account. 
“Alhamdulillah no Covid-related deaths were reported in the country in the last 24 hours. This is the first time in 2 years that this has happened,” he tweeted. 

 





 
Talking to Dawn, Dr Akram said the people should not forget that although the virulence of the virus had become decreased, it (virus) had the same transmission potential. 
“A reasonable portion of the population has been vaccinated in the country and others have been infected due to which a short-term immunity has been developed in the masses, but the people should continue taking precautions and follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs) because the number of cases is still around 500 and that can start multiplying rapidly again,” he said.
The NCOC data showed that 219,368,557 doses of vaccine had been administered to the people. As many as 128,074,138 people have got at least one dose of the vaccine. Of these, 101,881,176 have become fully vaccinated. Moreover, 4,869,245 people have been administered the booster dose. 
Dr Akram said the virus had the ability to bounce back, especially for diabetic and heart patients. 
“The 50pc population of over 50 years old has been suffering from heart diseases and 25pc of the overall population is diabetic and 30pc is overweight. So there is very much the issue of comorbidity in the country and the virus can be fatal for these people. So I suggest that people should continue to follow SOPs,” he said.

4,Can Article 254 provide legal cover to speaker’s actions?,PPP's Farooq H. Naek says the speaker relied upon the wrong legal provision to justify the delay in summoning the NA session.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly speaker’s decision to convene the session of the lower house of parliament beyond the stipulated time frame has generated debate on the scope of Article 254 of the Constitution, and whether it justifies the postponement of a crucial sitting requisitioned under Article 95 to vote on a resolution of no-confidence against the prime minister. 
While constitutional experts belonging to the opposition parties insist that the speaker’s decision to delay the National Assembly’s session is tantamount to high treason, those known for their independent views have termed this a ‘marriage of convenience’. 
Read: Opposition berates NA speaker for ‘violating’ Constitution 
According to Senator Raza Rabbani, who headed the constitutional reforms committee which authored the 18th Constitution Amendment, “Article 254 of the 1973 Constitution is a general provision, whereas Article 95 is a specific provision relating to a requisition of a sitting of parliament within the specified period of 14 days.” 

Legal opinion on whether this general provision applies to the summoning of an NA sitting for no-trust is also divided along party lines  

He said that it was a settled law that a specific provision would prevail over a general provision and failure by the speaker to summon the house within 14 days was a clear violation of the Constitution. 
According to him, recourse to Article 254 does not condone the act of violating the constitutional provision, but only provides cover for an act that is performed after the prescribed time has expired. 
Earlier, the PM’s adviser on parliamentary affairs, Dr Babar Awan, had defended the speaker’s decision to summon the session on March 25, saying that it was in line with the Constitution. 
He had referred to Article 254 of the Constitution, which states that “when anything is required to be done within a particular period but is not, the carrying out of that act or thing does not become invalid or ineffective just because it was not done within the prescribed period”. 
But in Mr Rabbani’s view, the requisition of a session of the National Assembly under Article 54, read with Article 95 (which deals with the vote of no-confidence), places the onus on the speaker to ensure that he summons the house before the expiry of 14 days — the outer limit provided by the Constitution. 
In his words, by not summoning the house within the period stipulated, the speaker is not only violating the Constitution but has also breached the privilege of parliament and its members. 
Senator Rabbani was of the opinion that the speaker had, in a way, abdicated the powers conferred on him under Article 54 to the political party he belongs to.

‘Subverting’ the Constitution
Taking a more rigid stance, former law minister and PPP senator Farooq H. Naek termed the speaker’s act “a subversion of the Constitution”. 
Talking to Dawn, he said that the National Assembly speaker had relied upon the wrong legal provision to justify a delay in summoning the session of the lower house. 
He was of the view that Article 254 was part of previous constitutions as well and was incorporated in the 1973 Constitution to give “post-facto condonation” in extreme cases. 
According to Mr Naek, such provisions were also part of the constitutions of other countries, and in Pakistan, it was included in the constitutions of 1956 and 1962, and subsequently carried forward into the document framed in 1973.
However, in this case, the mala fide intention of the NA speaker “is obvious”, since the session was requisitioned on March 8, while the speaker was aware that the OIC meeting was scheduled for 22nd and 23rd. Mr Naek said the speaker could have summoned the session sometime in the second week of March, but waited until the last day and on the pretext of the OIC moot, he dragged his heels on convening the sitting. 
A question of justification 
But senior lawyer Mohammad Azhar Siddique, who is close to the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, said that Article 254 was self-explanatory, as its very title read: “Failure to comply with requirement as to time does not render an act invalid.” 
Mr Siddique said that the Constitution never suggested any punitive action for a delay that was not deliberate, but provided a remedy to condone such an action. 
However, former PTI leader and leading lawyer Hamid Khan said that the real question was whether a planned constitutional move can be pre-empted by using another constitutional provision? 
The answer is obviously “no”, he said. 
In his words, the justification of non-availability of the assembly hall may not be a tangible justification since the OIC meeting was planned in advance. He said the speaker could have taken a better position, for example, contending that the result of a no-confidence resolution might create a chaotic situation, which was why voting had to be postponed. 
Mr Khan, however, said that such a delay could not be termed “subversion of the Constitution”, which is an offence under Article 6, i.e. treason.

5,"Defamation under Peca a non-cognisable offence, rules LHC","The FIA is supposed to register a FIR only in the case of a cognisable offence, judge observes.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) ruled on Wednesday that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) is supposed to register an FIR only in case of a cognisable offence under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) and that too after complying with its investigation rules.
However, in case of a non-cognisable offence, the circle in-charge of the agency’s cybercrime wing should seek permission of the competent court for investigation, Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh observed in his judgement.
The case related to the petition filed in the LHC by a lawyer, Munir Ahmad Bhatti, who challenged an order passed by an ex officio justice of peace in Lahore.
The lawyer said his brother made several defamatory statements against him in a YouTube programme. He then filed a complaint with the FIA cybercrime wing in Lahore on which an inquiry was initiated.

Justice Tariq Saleem observes FIA is supposed to lodge FIRs in cognisable crimes   

He said that after recording statements, the inquiry officer did not respond, which constrained him to approach the ex officio justice of peace with a request to order the FIA to register an FIR against the respondent.
However, the judge disposed of Mr Bhatti’s petition and directed the inquiry officer to conclude the inquiry as early as possible and then proceed in accordance with the law. The lawyer, being aggrieved with the order, then petitioned the high court.
His petitioner contended that the respondent, i.e. Mr Bhatti’s brother, committed a cognisable offence and therefore the FIA was obligated to register an FIR against him.
Non-cognisable offences misbehaviour, public annoyance, etc, and in such crimes a police officer has no authority to arrest someone without a warrant and cannot investigate a person without the court’s permission. In contrast, cognisable cases are more serious and a police officer has the authority to arrest someone without a warrant and to launch an investigation with or without court’s permission.  
The petitioner’s counsel argued that the ex officio justice of peace did not take into consideration Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which mandated that an FIR should be registered in respect of a cognisable offence right away without any inquiry or investigation.
However, a deputy attorney general told the court that the petitioner’s allegations could, at the most, constituted an offence under Section 20 of Peca (offences against a person’s dignity), which was non-cognisable and compoundable. Therefore, the impugned order was adequate in this regard, he argued.
Barrister Waqqas A. Mir — being an amicus curiae (friend of the court) — told the court that the investigation rules of 2018 under Peca prescribed a special procedure for their investigation, prosecution and trial.
These provisions would prevail over the CrPC if there was a conflict, he argued, adding that the petitioner’s reference to Section 154 of CrPC was inapt and inappropriate.
In the present case, no FIR could be registered because the complaint did not mention a cognisable offence, he added.
In his verdict, Justice Sheikh noted that the registration of an FIR was not a condition to start the investigation.
He observed that since cybercrimes required some preliminary inquiry to justify prosecution of an accused person, Rule 7(4) of the Investigation Rules 2018 talked about legal opinion and prior approval of the additional director in the FIA zone.
The judge observed that Peca and the Investigation Rules 2018 constituted a special law on the subject and would therefore prevail over the general law set out in the CrPC. 
He said Section 154 of CrPC ordained that when information relating to the commission of a cognisable offence was given to an officer in charge of a police station, he shall enter it in the prescribed book or register.
He held that the section did not permit the police to hold a preliminary inquiry before it to ascertain the authenticity of a piece of information. 
Peca rules, in contrast, required some actions before the FIR was lodged, the judge explained.
The allegation levelled by the petitioner against his brother apparently attracted Section 20 of Peca, which was a non-cognisable and compoundable offence in terms of Section 43.
About the merits of the case, Justice Sheikh observed that the ex officio peace justice rightly directed the inquiry officer to conclude it expeditiously and asked the parties to wait for its outcome.
“In as much as the alleged offence is non-cognisable, FIR cannot be ordered to be registered in any eventuality,” he concluded while dismissing the petition.
