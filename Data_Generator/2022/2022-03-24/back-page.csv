0,Imran’s days in government are numbered: Bilawal,PPP leader addresses Malakand rally despite ECP warning,"BATKHELA: Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has claimed that days of Imran Khan in government are numbered and soon he will be expelled through democratic course.  
Addressing a public meeting in Dargai town of Malakand district on Wednesday, he said Imran Khan was now ‘former prime minster’ because the opposition would defeat him during a no-trust vote in parliament.  
“We would remove Imran through democratic process and would not use any undemocratic way, nor will we attack any national institution,” he declared.  
Calling Imran Khan ‘former’ prime minister, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said this time no selection would take place; he was so isolated that nobody was ready to shake hands with him. “The nation wants to get this man [Imran] ousted as soon as possible because people are the worst sufferers due to wrong policies of the government.”  

PPP leader addresses Malakand rally despite ECP warning 

The PPP leader said no-trust move was a test case for democracy, neutrality and the federation of Pakistan, adding that Imran Khan was destined for a defeat in the no-confidence vote.  
He said the PTI leadership was unable to show power strength of 172 lawmakers in the National Assembly as a good number of PTI lawmakers had no trust in him and had joined hands with the opposition.  
Rigging unacceptable
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the opposition would not accept any kind of rigging in the upcoming no-trust vote against the prime minister, adding that the PPP wanted the constitutional process of no-trust vote be completed at the earliest. He said ouster of Imran Khan was vital for progress and restoration of economy because the incompetent government had plunged the country into turmoil.  
The PPP chairman said Imran Khan was violating the Constitution by trapping the National Assembly speaker in Article 6. “Imran Khan calls opposition leaders ‘rats’ and is himself running away because he himself is a ‘rat and coward man’.”  
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said that before teaching him Urdu Imran Khan should go and teach Urdu to his sons sitting abroad. 
He said Imran Khan was cursing the opposition leaders which didn’t sound good coming from the prime minister of a country. “Niazi is calling JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman ‘diesel’, but he has forgotten that the prices of diesel which is out of reach of the common man. He calls Shehbaz Sharif ‘boot polisher’, but he himself is a boot polisher.”  
Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the PTI government had sabotaged the CPEC project which was ‘game changer’ for progress and development of the country.  
He said that after defeating Imran Khan, the upcoming general elections would be transparent and fair which would be acceptable to all. He alleged that Imran Khan wanted to convert all national institutions, including the judiciary and NAB, and media into his ‘Tiger Force’.  
The PPP leader said the incumbent regime was a risk to the country, adding that Imran Khan was following the policies of Israel and India. He said India wanted to sabotage CPEC and the present rulers delayed and tried to make controversial the corridor project through anti-CPEC statements by his ministers.  
Recounting the achievements of the previous PPP government, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said his party had abolished the FCR law, eliminated terrorism from Malakand division, provided Sui gas, created opportunities for women to earn livelihood, established the First Women Bank, renamed the province as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and declared Malakand a tax-free zone.  
ECP warning
Mr Bhutto-Zardari addressed the public meeting despite the fact that he was issued a warning by the district monitoring officer (DMO) against doing so.  
The Malakand DMO had advised the PPP chairman not to attend the planned rally. In an advisory issued to the PPP chairman, the DMO said it had come to his knowledge from social media that he would address a public meeting in Dargai tehsil of Malakand district on March 23.  
“Keeping in view the code of conduct for local bodies elections, you are advised not to attend/participate in any congregation or to do any action that is against the code of conduct and directive issued by the ECP, failing which necessary action as per law will be initiated,” read the advisory.  
The gathering was also addressed by PPP provincial president Najmuddin Khan, Humayun Khan, former MPA Mohammad Ali Shah Bacha and Ahmed Ali. A large number of PPP activists participate in the gathering.

1,Opposition promises end to political meddling,"Issues charter promising  consensus-based electoral reforms, elimination of undemocratic interference in politics.","ISLAMABAD: Apparently upbeat about the success of its no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan in the National Assembly, the joint opposition on Wednesday issued a charter promising democratic good governance, consensus-based electoral reforms to ensure free and fair elections and elimination of undemocratic interference in politics in the wake of ouster of the incumbent government.
The opposition parties, in a broad-based joint charter, titled ‘Quwwat-i-Akhuwat-i-Awam’ — issued on Pakistan Day and covering a host of issues — said in view of the security challenges facing the country, the relevant institutions will be strengthened purely on professional lines. They vowed to eliminate terrorism through effective implementation of the National Security Policy, and introduce an effective, transparent and just law for across-the-board accountability to tackle financial corruption.
The charter also pledged to frame a policy, on an urgent basis, to ensure relief for the poor, labourers, farmers and fixed-income groups. Concrete steps would be taken for the recovery of all victims of enforced disappearance, the opposition promised.

It also vowed to strengthen the 18th Amendment and provincial autonomy, and ensure transfer of power from the provinces down to the local governments. It further said civic, human, social, gender and minority rights would be guaranteed and implementation of constitutional provisions to this effect would be ensured.
The charter claimed to do away with all the curbs on freedom of expression and the media and repeal black laws against the media. It also promised to defend the Islamic provisions of the Constitution as well as the fundamental human, political and social rights of people.
The opposition parties also pledged to improve the standard of living of people, rid the country of the debt trap and remove social and economic disparity.
They said after the success of the no-trust motion, a truly representative elected government would  come into power through free and fair elections to hammer out a strategy for economic development based on social justice.
In the charter, the opposition also pledged to transform Pakistan into a state where the Constitution would  be supreme and all administrative institutions of the country would  be subservient to the elected executive and parliament.
National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser has summoned a session of the Lower House to deliberate on the opposition’s no-confidence resolution against Prime Minister Khan on Friday (tomorrow) at 11am.
PML-N long march 
Meanwhile, the PML-N has amended the schedule of its long march on Islamabad. The party’s rally, led by its vice presidents Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz, will now depart from Lahore on March 26 and reach Islamabad on March 28. The decision was taken at a meeting of the long march management committee held here with PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif in the chair.
The change in schedule has been made following the much-criticised decision of the National Assembly speaker to summon a session on the no-trust move on March 25 — four days after the constitutional deadline.

2,"Out of the frying pan, Ukrainian reaches Gaza","According to Ukraine’s diplomatic office in Ramallah,  there are some 2,500 Ukrainians in Gaza.","BUREIJ: After Russia invaded Ukraine, Viktoria Saidam knew she needed to find a “safer place” than Kyiv and ultimately chose her husband’s homeland — a Palestinian territory not typically associated with security: Gaza. 
Saidam, 21, was born Viktoria Breij in Vinnytsia, a town some 200 kilometres southwest of Ukraine’s capital. 
While studying pharmacy in Kyiv, she met Ibrahim Saidam, a medical student from Bureij, a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli-blockaded Mediterranean enclave home to 2.3 million Palestinians. 
Since they married two years ago, Viktoria Saidam had been keen to get to Gaza to meet her in-laws, but the Russian assault launched on February 24 accelerated that long-anticipated family gathering, she told AFP. 
“We understood that there was no way to know what tomorrow would bring. The number of dead and dying was rising every day,” said the young woman, sobbing as she watched videos of Russian strikes destroying buildings in Ukraine. 
Their first move was to pack up, leave Kyiv and head to Vinnytsia. They left the town before a March 7 Russian bombardment on Vinnytsia’s airport killed nine people according Ukraine’s emergency services. 
“My husband and I had to look for a safer place than Ukraine,” Saidam said. “We chose his homeland, Gaza.”  
The couple fled Ukraine by minibus and then on foot, walking across the Romanian border. 
They then flew to Cairo and from there headed for the Rafah crossing with southern Gaza. 
The young woman said she knows “the reality” of life in Gaza, a territory controlled by Hamas since 2007 and under strict Israeli blockade for 15 years now.  “There was a war here, and it can start again, but we had to leave Ukraine and (Gaza) was safe,” Saidam said. 
“We don’t know what will happen tomorrow,” added the Ukrainian woman who converted to Islam shortly after her wedding and who so far speaks only a few words of Arabic. 
“We hope and pray for the best.”  
According to Ukraine’s diplomatic office in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, there are some 2,500 Ukrainians in Gaza, mostly women who have married Palestinians men who studied abroad, like Ibrahim. 
The impeccably coiffed 23-year-old husband, who speaks fluent Ukrainian, said that having lived through three of the Gaza wars, he has “some experience” with conflict.

3,Iran welcomes Syria ties with Arab nations,"Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian visits Damascus, meets Syrian counterpart.","DAMASCUS: Iran’s top diplomat on Wednesday welcomed efforts to “normalise relations” between some Arab countries and Syria, days after President Bashar al-Assad made a surprise visit to the United Arab Emirates. 
Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks on a visit to Damascus during which he met Assad, his Syrian counterpart Faisal Mekdad and National Security Bureau chief Ali Mamlouk. 
Amir-Abdollahian welcomed the reconciliation approach by the UAE toward Syria. He added that Tehran was close to reaching an agreement on its nuclear programme with world powers. 
Iran has given financial and military support to the Assad regime in Syria’s 11-year war. It says it has deployed forces in Syria at the invitation of Damascus and only as advisers. 
“We welcome the fact that some Arab countries are trying to normalise relations with the Syrian Arab Republic by adopting a new approach. We are happy with it,” said Amir-Abdollahian. 
Mekdad said the visit was “a good opportunity to review developments in the region and bilateral relations”. 
Amir-Abdollahian has travelled to Damascus twice since August last year. His latest visit follows Assad’s trip to the UAE last week, his first to an Arab country since the start of the war.

4,"Leaving girls in tears, Taliban order closure of high schools","UN rights chief, Malala, US envoy disappointed by Taliban move","KABUL: The Taliban ordered girls’ secondary schools in Afghanistan to shut on Wednesday just hours after they reopened, sparking heartbreak and confusion over the policy reversal by the hardline regime. 
The U-turn was announced after thousands of girls resumed lessons for the first time since August, when the Taliban seized control of the country and imposed harsh restrictions on women. 
The education ministry offered no coherent explanation even as officials held a ceremony in the capital to mark the start of the academic year, saying it was a matter for the country’s leadership. 
“In Afghanistan, especially in the villages, the mindsets are not ready,” spokesman Aziz Ahmad Rayan told reporters. “We have some cultural restrictions... but the main spokesmen of the Islamic Emirate will offer better clarifications.” 
A Taliban source told AFP the decision came after a meeting late Tuesday by senior officials in the southern city of Kandahar, the movement’s de facto power centre and conservative spiritual heartland. 

UN rights chief, Malala, US envoy disappointed by Taliban move

Wednesday’s date for girls to resume school had been announced weeks earlier by the ministry, with spokesman Rayan saying the Taliban had a “responsibility to provide education and other facilities to our students”. 
They insisted that pupils aged 12 to 19 would be segregated — even though most Afghan schools are already same-sex — and operate according to Islamic principles. 
Crestfallen girls at Zarghona High School in the capital, Kabul, tearfully packed up their belongings after teachers halted the lesson. “I see my students crying and reluctant to leave classes,” said Palwasha, a teacher at Omara Khan girls’ school in Kabul. “It is very painful to see them crying.” 
‘Profound frustration’
The UN rights chief voiced deep disappointment over the decision. “I share the profound frustration and disappointment of Afghan high school girls and women, who after six months of anticipation were prevented from returning to school today,” UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a statement in Geneva. 
“The de facto authorities’ failure to adhere to commitments to reopen schools for girls above the sixth grade — in spite of repeated commitments towards girls’ education, including during my visit to Kabul two weeks ago — is deeply damaging for Afghanistan,” she said and warned that “the denial of education violates the human rights of women and girls. 
US special envoy to Afghanistan Rina Amiri tweeted the move “weakens confidence in the Taliban commitments” and “further dashes the hopes of families for a better future for their daughters”.
Nobel Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai, who survived a Pakistani Taliban assassination attempt when she was 15-years-old and has long campaigned for girls’ education, also expressed dismay. 
“They will keep finding excuses to stop girls from learning — because they are afraid of educated girls and empowered women,” she said on Twitter. 
Afghan expert Andrew Watkins, of the US Institute of Peace, said the about-face reflected a rift in the Taliban leadership. “This last-minute change appears to be driven by ideological differences in the movement... about how girls returning to school will be perceived by their followers,” he said.
