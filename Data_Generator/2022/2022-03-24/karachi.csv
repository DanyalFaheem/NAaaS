0,Citizens’ enthusiasm brightens up Pakistan Day celebrations in Karachi,Processions were taken out and rallies were staged across Sindh to celebrate Pakistan Day.,"KARACHI: The passing of Pakistan Resolution of 1940 was celebrated with great enthusiasm and fanfare in Sindh on Wednesday. 
In Karachi, 75th Pakistan Day dawned with a 21-gun salute by Navy along with prayers for Pakistan’s solidarity. 
There were flag-hoisting ceremonies and illuminations at all important buildings of the city. The Navy also organised such ceremonies. 
A boat rally of local fishermen, debate competitions and rallies by students were held in Ormara and Gwadar. 
The Board of Management of the Quaid-i-Azam House Museum-Institute of Nation Building organised an event at the museum. The flag hoisting ceremony was performed by Liaquat H. Merchant, senior vice chairman and grandnephew of the Quaid-i-Azam and board members. 
A student band from the Ida Rieu School for special children played the national anthem. 
They sang national songs along with students of Jinnah Foundation School and Hamdard Foundation School. 
Rare photos of Quaid-i-Azam
A special exhibition of rare photos through the lens of Z.D. Barni (Agha Ziauddin Barni) opened at the State Bank Museum. 
Before 1947, Z.D. Barni was working with the Ministry of Information and he continued in that capacity in the newly-formed Pakistan. He accompanied the Quaid-i-Azam on official tours. 
He also filmed and photographed the funeral and last rites of the Quaid. 
According to Dr Asma Ibrahim, director of the SPB Museum, the granddaughter of Mr Barni, Zarreen Baqir, was kind enough to offer to display her grandfather’s rare collection of photographs from the family archives. 
Mr Barni’s sudden death in 1980 left many things unattended but his careful and professional way of storing all his photos is evident from the collection. 
The photographs make you see them and then turn around to come back to them again. There is the elegant tall figure of the Quaid-i-Azam making speeches, walking alongside his sister Miss Fatima Jinnah, attending public gatherings, taking the guard of honour, saluting, shaking hands, taking oath as Governor General, having tea, reading wearing his monocle in the right eye, smoking, sitting in his drawing room, in sherwani, in suit and tie. 
Along with this exhibition, also to commemorate Pakistan Resolution Day, there was a digital exhibition of rare commemorative stamps, coins, souvenir sheets and medals issued on March 23 over the years.

A Pakistan Day Bicycle Marathon was organised in North Nazimabad. 
More than 400 cyclists took part in the race. The cyclists, including young children from age six and up to 60 years and older, pedalled over a 20km route from 9am to 12 noon.
Women’s Power Run
A special Pakistan Day five-kilometre Women’s Power Run 2022 was organised at Abdul Sattar Edhi Avenue at 7am in which hundreds of runners participated. Leading sports personalities, including youth athletes, also attended the event.

TLP event
The Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan also took out a big rally from Karachi airport to Mazar-i-Quaid led by its chief Hafiz Saad Rizvi. 
A large number of party workers riding on motorbikes, cars and other modes of transport drove through Sharea Faisal and Shahra-i-Quaideen to reach the mausoleum. 
In their speeches, the TLP leaders criticised the rulers for “making life of common man difficult” as growing inflation, fast shrinking economy and uncertain financial conditions posed big problems to the people.

1,Murder of dismissed SHO linked to Lyari gang war: Karachi city police chief,ATC’s permission sought for online hearings; FIR lodged under anti-terror law.,"KARACHI: A day after the broad daylight killing of two accused, including a former SHO, facing trial in the Arshad Pappu murder case, investigators said on Wednesday that the murders were carried out by remnants of one of the gangs operating in Lyari.
Dismissed police inspector Chand Khan Niazi and his friend Abdul Rehman were gunned down in Saddar when they were heading home after hearing of the 2013 triple murder case against them at an antiterrorism court inside the judicial complex in Karachi central prison on a motorcycle on Tuesday.
This is the second such incident as in December 2021 another dismissed cop Javed Baloch and his friend Muhammad Mussadiq were shot dead in the Soldier Bazaar area while returning from the same ATC conducting trial of the Arshad Pappu murder case.
The two incidents forced the police to approach the court concerned for its permission to hold online hearings of certain cases due to “security risk” involved in the movement of remaining accused who are out on bail.

ATC’s permission sought for online hearings; FIR lodged under anti-terror law

‘Killers identified’
On Wednesday, Karachi police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon told Dawn that the killers who assassinated the two former SHOs had been identified.
“We are sure that these murders are linked with erstwhile Lyari gang warfare as the victims were known accused,” he said. 
He said that raids were being conducted for the arrests of the suspected killers.
He said the police devised a strategy for protection of remaining accused and witnesses.
The city police chief said the arrangements had been made and permission was being sought from the court for holding online hearings from next week.
‘Return of gangsters to Lyari’
Social activists of Lyari on Wednesday said former SHO Niazi was a resident of Shah Beg Lane, where a significant number of his Mianwali community had been living since long. 
They said he was a known personality in Lyari, who had ‘acquaintance’ with area drug peddlers even prior to the emergence of elements of gang warfare.
They said some gangsters, who had earlier gone underground or fled abroad after the launch of Karachi operation in 2013, had recently returned to Lyari and started “giving extortion chits to people”.
The activists said that there were reports that two close relatives of Arshad Pappu had been picked up on Tuesday night. 
However, police expressed ignorance about any such arrest.
Case registered
The Preedy police lodged an FIR against unknown persons on the complaint of deceased SHO’s son Ghulam Mustafa Niazi. 
The case was registered under Section 302 (premeditated murder), 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
The complainant told the police that his father was a former police inspector and he was nominated in the murder case of Arshad Pappu.
He said victim Abdul Rehman was his father’s friend and he was also one of the accused in the same case.
This was also confirmed by the counsel of Lyari gangster Uzair Baloch.
Advocate Abid Zaman said that Abdul Rehman was a private person as he was a teacher in Balochistan. “The prosecution has not assigned any specific role to Rehman and he was simply booked for being associated with the main accused persons,” the lawyer said.
The two slain former SHOs along with Uzair Baloch and others were charged with murdering Arshad Pappu, his brother Yasir Arafat and their confidant Jumma Shera in March 2013.

3,Imran Ismail rules out chances of governor’s rule in province for now,"CM Murad Ali Shah warns of consequences if no-trust move delayed, bulldozed.","KARACHI: While Governor Imran Ismail on Wednesday ruled out for the time being the possibility of imposing governor’s rule in Sindh, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah warned that any attempt to delay or bulldoze the process of no-confidence move against Prime Minister Imran Khan would have its consequences.
The governor was welcomed by the chief minister at the mausoleum of Father of the Nation Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah on Pakistan Day. They laid a floral wreath on the mazar and offered fateha together.
However, they spoke to the media separately.
“The governor’s rule is imposed on the order of the president of the country. I will impose it if and whenever I am asked to do it by the president,” the governor said, adding that nothing like that was happening at the moment.

Murad warns of consequences if no-trust move delayed, bulldozed

Terming the dissident MNAs of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf “traitor”, the governor called for such legislation that prevented the members from switching their ‘loyalties’.
About PTI’s coalition partners at the centre, he said that both the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan and Pakistan Muslim League-Q were free to take their own decisions.
No-trust move opposition’s constitutional right: Murad
Speaking to reporters, CM Shah said that moving a no-confidence motion against the prime minister was the constitutional right of the opposition, warning that any attempt to delay or bulldoze the process would have its consequences.
Recalling the no-confidence move against then prime minister Benazir Bhutto, Mr Shah said that the resolution was tabled on Oct 23, 1989, and within eight days i.e. on Nov 1, 1989 voting was conducted, but the PTI government was running away to face the resolution tabled by the joint opposition.
“Let the house freely vote on the resolution,” he advised the National Assembly speaker. He, however, disagreed with a reporter that the no-confidence move would derail the democratic system.
Mr Shah said that he was sure that the no-confidence motion would be successful.
Replying to another question, he said that the MQM-P leadership had held a meeting with Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari and discussed strengthening of the local governments.
Mr Shah paid rich tribute to the founding fathers of the country and said 82 years ago they had passed a resolution in 1940 and demanded a separate homeland. “The resolution set the direction for the struggle of Pakistan.”

5,"Out of mind, out of sight",Andhera Honay Tak is part of Napa’s ongoing Young Directors Festival...,"KARACHI: These days the National Academy of Performing Arts (Napa) is holding its annual Young Directors Festival. It began from March 18 and will conclude on March 29 after presenting six plays, each having a two-day run. 
The second play of the event put up on Monday evening was Andhera Honay Tak, an Urdu adaptation of English playwright Fredrick Knott’s Wait Until Dark. Anyone who’s not into theatre and loves films may have watched Dial M for Murder adapted from his play. 
Andhera Honay Tak, translated by Babar Jamal and directed by Gazzain Abbas, tells the story of a visually impaired woman Sofi (Bazelah Mustafa) whose husband has incidentally brought a robot related to a woman who has been murdered and in which a conman, Tipu (Zuhair Zubair), has a keen interest because of what the robot contains. (The word ‘robot’ is uttered with a variety of pronunciations during the course of the crime drama.) To retrieve it, he gathers two more sinister men Dilair (Hafeez Lehri) and Aziz (Amjad Junejo). When the curtains go up, Dilair and Aziz run into each other in Sofi’s place, who is living alone because her husband is away for work. 
Now as can be guessed, since the principal character of Sofi is blind, the plot has quite a few twists. The conmen after realising that she can’t see, try and dupe her into telling them where the robot is, but the woman is not as naïve as they think she is. She can sense that something is off with the men who meet her in different roles. The unseen tussle leads to a climax involving the use of light, both in metaphorical and literal senses.

Andhera Honay Tak is part of Napa’s ongoing Young Directors Festival

It seemed on Monday that in order to focus more on the climactic sequence because it had action, the young director, Abbas, overlooked at least a couple of extremely important aspects. It is always challenging for an ‘able’ actor to play a disabled person. For example, the one who can see will never fully know how it feels to be blind. Therefore to get even a small fraction of that knowledge, extensive research is required — how a blind person descends the stairs, steps into a room after opening a door, moves the arms when pointing at a spot without facing it, etc. There are movies and dramas in which formidable actors have essayed such roles to a great degree of success.
Fumbling the lines on stage is not a sin. But letting the audience know that you’ve forgotten your line means more hard diligence is required.

6,"Most diabetics can easily fast during Ramazan, say experts",KARACHI: Health and medical science experts believed that people with diabetes were no longer at health risks while...,"KARACHI: Health and medical science experts believed that people with diabetes were no longer at health risks while fasting during Ramazan. 
They advised the diabetics of following a healthy routine in the holy month so they could fast without facing difficulties due to a lack of awareness about how to cope with their illness while fasting.
Speaking at the 8th International Diabetes and Ramazan Conference 2022, the professionals were of the view that fasting was a form of devotion and it favours in human health. Now, better medicines and insulin were available to help people with diabetes to fast safely without getting into any trouble with their health. 
Prof Dr Abdul Basit, a diabetologist and general secretary of the Diabetes Association of Pakistan (DAP), said that just over a decade ago 90 per cent of the medical practitioners were not allowing people with diabetes to fast but research and studies proved that most of the diabetics could easily fast just by adjusting their medicines and timings of insulin in consultation with their physicians. 
“We then decided to collect scientific evidence to see if people with chronic illnesses like diabetes, hypertension and obesity could fast safely or not as over 90pc of people are suffering from either of these conditions. A lot of work in this regard is still required to be done but researches show that many people with these illnesses can fast,” he said. 
The organising secretary of the two-day conference, Prof Yaqoob Ahmedani, said they were holding awareness activities for the doctors and people since 2008. Because of such efforts, millions of people can safely fast and perform Haj, Umrah without any health concerns. 
“Requesting Muslims not to use chronic illnesses as ‘an excuse’ to refrain from fasting in Ramazan,” renowned scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani said, adding that physicians could be the best persons to advise whether a person should fast or not. 
“Latest researches have shown that most of the people with diabetes can fast. Fasting is beneficial for most diabetics in helping control the disease. Patients should not hide behind the Islamic concession, which has given to those whose health can deteriorate if they fast,” he added.

7,Faiz Ki Muhabbat Mein launched,KARACHI: A book titled Faiz Ki Muhabbat Mein by the Canadian-based author and poet Ashfaq Hussain was launched at ...,"KARACHI: A book titled Faiz Ki Muhabbat Mein by the Canadian-based author and poet Ashfaq Hussain was launched at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) on Tuesday evening. 
The book in its introduction to the topic suggests that the critical edition of poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s collected works, edited by Dr Syed Nomanul Haq and published in 2019, “is not reliable as the version has many errors, omissions and lapses despite having some good aspects”. 
Presiding over the event, moderated by Mujahid Barelvi, veteran politician Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan said Faiz Ki Muhabbat Mein could only have been written if the author was in love with Faiz. Ashfaq Hussain is an admirer of Faiz sahib and his effort to point out the omissions and errors in the collected works of Faiz is a result of his love for the poet and not a consequence of trying to put down anyone. 
To contextualise the scenario, Chaudhry Ahsan mentioned the famous Faiz nazm, Mujh se pehli si muhabbat merey mehboob na maang sung by Malika-i-Tarannum Noor Jehan. 
He said while listening to the composition, he realised that a particular verse was missing from the composed version. He checked it in the poet’s book Naqsh-i-Faryadi and found it there. So, such things are not an unusual occurrence in works of literature. 
Dr Shehnaz Shoro talked about the author, who like her resides in Canada and his profound admiration for Faiz. 
Farasat Rizvi gave a historical perspective of things by mentioning that in Urdu literature books have been penned to point out omissions or mistakes found in other books. 
Shahid Rassam read an essay on the subject. 
After the event, talking to newsmen and answering a question about the ongoing political situation in the country, Aitzaz Ahsan said: “Umpires are never neutral.”
