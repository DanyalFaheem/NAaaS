0,Nadra unclear about potential taxpayers’ data status,A source claims Nadra has no confidence in the data mainly because of the mechanism used for evolving it.,"ISLAMABAD: The plan to broaden the tax base is facing delays as the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) is unclear about the status of data of potential taxpayers, Dawn has learnt from knowledgeable sources.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and Nadra had signed an agreement to come up with data of potential taxpayers for uploading on the FBR web portal for the voluntarily filing of tax returns. As part of the agreement, the FBR has already shared its data with Nadra for verification.
Earlier, the government has claimed to have collected data of over 43 million people to identify potential taxpayers for bringing them under the tax net. The campaign on the voluntary filing of tax returns on the basis of this data was to be launched in December 2021 and then in January, but missed in both cases by the FBR.
The deadline for sharing the data has already lapsed, a source in the FBR told Dawn. “We have sent several letters as well as reminders to Nadra,” the source said.
Nadra will scrutinise and filter the data sent by the FBR to identify the potential taxpayers while using a scoring system. Similarly, it will also process the data to compare it with certain indicators through Artificial Intelligence to identify non-filers and then share the data with the FBR within a period of 40 days for uploading on its specific web portal.
Last week, a high-level meeting was also convened in the FBR to review the status of the data. The meeting was also attended by senior Nadra officials, the source said, adding Nadra wants FBR to take ownership of the status of data after uploading it on its website.
Another source claimed that Nadra has no confidence in the data mainly because of the mechanism used for evolving it. “Nadra is not satisfied with the data,” the source said, adding Nadra wanted FBR to take responsibility if any issue arises after uploading on the website.
According to the source, the FBR has conveyed to Nadra that the tax machinery has no mechanism to check or verify the data. The only system is to issue a notice to a person and then follow the procedures laid down in the Income Tax Ordinance.
In the first phase, Nadra has provided data of 100 people, which according to the source was returned back on the plea of deficiencies. As a result, the sharing of data would now be further delayed, the source said.
On the other hand, the FBR has already finalised a comprehensive plan, which includes a mass media campaign to encourage people to come under the tax net on a voluntary basis. This also includes a dedicated web portal on the FBR website for uploading data.
The FBR has also signed an agreement with tax bar associations for allowing a lawyer to charge a fee of Rs5,000 for the filing of the tax return which involves a minimum tax of Rs10,000. “We have already hired lawyers for this purpose”, the source said.
The proposed list of people would be uploaded on the FBR website for information of the general public, the source said, adding that the data would also be uploaded on a dedicated interactive app so that people could check their details. On the interactive app, people would also be able to verify or reject the information about them, the source said.
A dedicated time period will be given to people to file their returns on a voluntary basis. Legal action will be initiated after the lapse of time for voluntarily filing the tax returns.
Broadening the tax base using Nadra data was earlier tried in the governments of the PPP and then the PML-N and notices were issued in bulk but the FBR failed to bring people under the tax net.

1,‘Big banks not doing enough for digitisation’,Pakistan Fintech Network Chairman Nadeem Hussain criticises big banks for paying lip service to digitisation.,"KARACHI: Serial entrepreneur and Pakistan Fintech Network Chairman Nadeem Hussain has urged the government to disincentivise cash transactions for the promotion of digitisation.
Speaking at the Pakistan Leadership Conversation 2022 held by the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants on Tuesday, the founding CEO of Tameer Microfinance Bank said the acceptance for digital payments at the local kiryana store is still low.
“The world has moved to SoftPoS but we’re still sceptical,” he said while referring to the software point-of-sale (PoS) that allows merchants to accept card payments directly on their phone.
The country had a little more than 79,000 PoS machines at the end of September 2021. The share of PoS transactions in the total value transacted in July-September 2021 was merely 0.06 per cent, according to the latest data provided by the State Bank of Pakistan.
He took a dig at big banks for paying lip service to digitisation but limiting their efforts to improving the front end alone. 
“Creating a sexy app, with maybe a half-decent UI/UX [user interface/user experience] isn’t digitisation. If you are still gonna take a month and a half to approve a credit card or a personal loan, if you’re gonna take a month to open a basic account for an SME, then that’s not a track you want to follow for digitisation,” he said.
Mr Hussain called out tech entrepreneurs for focusing exclusively on developing apps for the 50 million users of smartphones in Pakistan while ignoring the app market for 65m users of feature phones. He also criticised banks for designing savings accounts that are ill-suited to the savings habits of Pakistanis.
“People don’t save money in bank accounts. They use committees to save. What’re we doing to facilitate committees? The second biggest form of savings is gold and gold ornaments. What’re we doing to offer fractional gold savings products? Something that allows buying and selling gold for Rs100?” he said.
Mr Hussain took a shot at big family businesses for being “too busy building malls and power plants rather than putting even half a billion dollars in the digital world”. Giving the example of India’s Paytm, a pay-through-mobile Indian company worth $20 billion, Mr Hussain said its founder was daring enough to put in $1bn of his own money to launch the business.
“You have to put money on the table. You’ll lose money at first. But you can’t create unicorns by investing $10-20m,” he said.

2,Transit trade with Kabul under temporary admission documents allowed,"The move, aimed at improving regional connectivity with the Central Asian States, envisages the provision of TAD to transporters.","ISLAMABAD:  Pakistan and Afghanistan have implemented movement of transit and  bilateral trade through Temporary Admis­sion Documents (TAD) for  commercial vehicles.
The Pakistan Embassy in Kabul and the  consulate generals in Jalalabad and Kandahar will issue TAD for Afghan  vehicles. The Afg­han Embassy in Islamabad and consulate generals in  Peshawar and Quetta will issue the entry documents for Pakistani  vehicles.
The move, aimed at improving regional connectivity with the Central Asian States, envisages the provision of TAD to transporters  from both sides.
As part of the agreement, both countries will  allow free movement of each other’s trucks in their territories and  cross-stuffing of goods at border points.
Early this month, senior  officials of Pakistan and Afghanistan met at the Torkham border to  discuss the smooth flow of trade and pedestrians, largely as part of a  scheme aimed at enhancing bilateral ties with the landlocked country.
Since  Aug 15, 2021, when the Taliban took over and declared their rule over  Afghanistan, Islamabad has offered Kabul — among other humanitarian  assistance — waivers of duty and taxes on fresh and dry fruits,  vegetables and several other products.
During the last meeting,  both sides agreed that the competent authority of one contracting party  would issue a TAD against a fee to the vehicles registered and licensed  in the territory of the other contracting party for international  carriage of goods.
The two sides also agreed that TAD would be valid for six months and multiple journeys, while its fee was fixed at $100.
The  transport operators can carry transit goods and bilateral trade goods,  but sabotage is not allowed and any truck found transporting goods  between two destinations inside the territory of the contracting party  will be blacklisted.
The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation  in Afgh­anistan and the Federal Board of Revenue in Pakistan are the  competent authorities to issue TAD.

3,Punjab to go for early wheat procurement,"Traditionally, the food department starts distributing gunny bags after April 15.","LAHORE: Punjab is preparing for an early start of wheat procurement drive — maybe in the first week of April — as the crop has matured early on the back of a rise in temperature in the absence of rains in March. 
According to food department officials, they have already dispatched gunny bags to 13 districts of the south, where crop matures earlier than the northern part. Some carryover bags were already there and fresh ones have been sent.
Traditionally, the food department starts distributing gunny bags after April 15.
The department has set a target of 3.5 million tonnes and may stick to it. “Even if it has to increase, it may not be much,” explains one of the officials, saying that each tonne carries a huge financial cost. It is carrying over half a million tonnes, and with the addition of 3.5m tonnes, the total stock for next year would be four million tonnes. 
The department is hoping for the purchase of 2.2m tonnes by the millers and total availability would thus be 6.2m tonnes for the next year.
About the wheat crop situation, the department says that the first survey has indicated a better production position. In January, when the urea crisis deepened and its usage worsened, Punjab lowered its production expectations to 18.8m tonnes. By the end of February, it was hoping for 20m tonnes. 
These fears also factored in predictions of excessive rains during March, making Punjab planners a worried lot. However, the first survey of the crop now shows that the situation may not be as bad as feared earlier. The province is now expecting to end up somewhere close to last year’s production of 20.9m tonnes.
Both these factors — rise in March temperatures and relatively better size — have pushed Punjab to prepare for an early procurement drive and the department is already in action. It is replenishing the gunny bags stocks but the final decision (the day to start actual procurement) would be taken by the deputy commissioner (DC) concerned according to local conditions.
The department will distribute the district targets and ensure gunny bags and the deputy commissioner will do the rest.
The millers, however, are worried about casting DCs in the role of in-charge of the drive. “It means administrative measures will be taken to complete the target,” says Khaliq Arshad, a miller from the city.
The current market price is higher than the official rate and it makes administrative steps necessary to get to the targets. 
It also means the millers would have to wait for the purchase till the food department completes its target.

4,Big stores decry faulty National Sales Tax Return portal,Tier-1 retailers are facing problems to comply with complicated and erroneous processes due to the malfunctioning portal.,"KARACHI: Retailers connected to the Federal Board of Revenue’s Point-of-Sale (POS) Integration System have been unable to file correct tax returns for the past two months due to the malfunctioning of the new National Sales Tax Return (NSTR) portal.  
Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP) Chairman Tariq Mehboob informed Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin on March 22 said that Tier-1 retailers are facing problems to comply with complicated and erroneous processes due to the malfunctioning portal.
In the recent past, CAP — the official trade body for organised retail sector — has identified the various deficiencies and communicated these to the FBR in meetings and letters multiple times. 
Upon the visit of FBR chairman to the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry this week, these issues were highlighted once again. 
However, the problems have still not been resolved due to possible capacity limitations of the FBR IT setup.
Due to the flawed FBR system, integrated retailers have had to pay extra sales tax for consecutive two months due to disallowance of genuine credit invoices by the NSTR portal.

5,"Oil jumps, stocks fall","Crude futures jumped more than four per cent with Brent North Sea, the international benchmark, exceeding $120 per barrel.","LONDON: Oil prices surged while stock markets fell on Wednesday on renewed fears over Russian energy supplies and soaring inflation.
Crude futures jumped more than four percent with Brent North Sea, the international benchmark, exceeding $120 per barrel.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak on Wednesday warned that a ban on Russian oil and gas imports over the Ukraine war -- which some EU countries are demanding -- would drive the world’s energy markets to a  “collapse”.
“It is absolutely obvious that without Russian hydrocarbons, if sanctions are introduced, there will be a collapse of the oil and gas markets,” Novak told Russia’s lower house State Duma as reported by Russian news agencies.
“The rise in energy prices may be unpredictable,” Novak added.
President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, hit back at  “unfriendly countries” -- which include EU members -- as he announced that Russia will now only accept rubles for gas deliveries.
Russia also warned that repairs at a terminal near a Black Sea port may take up to two months and lead to a drop in oil exports of about one million barrels per day.
Moscow could face more sanctions as US President Joe Biden left Wednesday for Europe on a mission to bolster Western unity against Russia.
On stock markets, London’s benchmark FTSE 100 index was down 0.2pc in afternoon trading. 
In Frankfurt, the DAX was 1.5pc lower while the Paris CAC 40 was shedding 1.3pc.

6,UK cuts taxes to soften cost-of-living hit,Finance minister sets out measures that will inject about 17.6 billion pounds into the economy in the coming financial year.,"LONDON: Britain Finance Minister Rishi Sunak cut taxes for workers and reduced a duty on fuel on Wednesday as he sought to soften a severe cost-of-living squeeze against the backdrop of fast-rising inflation and slowing economic growth.
Announcing a half-yearly budget update overshadowed by the conflict in Ukraine, Sunak set out measures that would inject about 17.6 billion pounds ($23.2bn) into the economy in the coming financial year.
“The actions we have taken to sanction (Russian President Vladimir) Putin’s regime are not cost-free for us at home,” he told parliament.  “The invasion of Ukraine presents a risk to our recovery as it does to countries around the world.”  In response to the hit to living standards - with inflation seen peaking at nearly 9 per cent in late 2022 - Sunak said he was increasing the threshold at which workers start to pay national insurance, or social security, contributions by 3,000 pounds ($3,958.50) from July.
“That’s a 6-billion-pound personal tax cut for 30 million people across the United Kingdom,” he said, adding it would save workers more than 330 pounds a year each and was the largest single personal tax cut in a decade.
In his Spring Statement, Sunak announced a cut in fuel duty of 5 pence per litre, to start later on Wednesday and last until March next year. He said the basic rate of income tax would be reduced by one pence in the pound in 2024, when Britons are next to due to vote in a general election.
However, the Office for Budget Responsibility said living standards, adjusted for inflation, would not recover their pre-pandemic levels until the 2024/25 financial year and would suffer their biggest contraction in the 12 months from April since at least the mid-1950s.
Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have been under pressure, including from lawmakers within their Conservative Party, to do more to help households as they struggle with the rising cost of living.
Sunak announced new forecasts showing the British economy will grow more slowly this year than previously predicted and that inflation will be much higher.
The forecasts drawn up by the OBR showed the economy was likely to grow by 3.8pc in 2022, a sharp slowdown from a forecast of 6pc made in October.

7,"Karachi retailers defy commissioner’s chicken, mutton price list",Pakistan Poultry Association claims it has no role in price-fixing.,"KARACHI: The prices of chicken and mutton notified by Commissioner Karachi on March 18 have yet to provide any relief to the masses as they continue to buy these products at inflated rates set by the retailers.
There are hardly any retail chicken and meat shops which display the official price list, while most retailers have termed the Commissioner rates as “unrealistic.”
On Wednesday, retailers quoted the live bird rate at Rs330-340 per kg followed by Rs530-580 per kg for its meat (without giblets).
The price regulator had not fixed the boneless chicken rate, thus providing a free hand to the stakeholders to charge between Rs700-800 per kg, almost close to veal boneless meat, which is selling at Rs850 per kg.

Pakistan Poultry Association claims it has no role in price-fixing

After week-long deliberations and consultations with the stakeholders, on March 18, Commissioner Karachi Mohammad Iqbal Memon had issued the retail rate of live bird at Rs235 per kg followed by Rs356 per kg for chicken meat and Rs1,220 per kg for mutton. At that time, live bird was already available at Rs330 per kg, chicken meat at over Rs500 per kg and mutton at Rs1,400-1,600 per kg.
Before finalising the official rate of mutton, Deputy Commissioners of various districts had informed Commissioner Karachi regarding the sale of mutton at Rs1,400-2,000 per kg.
Chicken dealers said the government should provide live birds at an officially-fixed rate so that they can sell these at a controlled rate.
Calling the move a “facesaving exercise” by the city administration, the dealers slammed consumers’ protection bodies which cannot ensure the supply of live birds at a low rate fixed by the government.
Like past practice, the price regulator had already failed in implementing the previous rate of Rs138 per kg for the live bird, Rs214 per kg for its meat and Rs740 per kg for mutton which remained posted on the Commissioner website for years instead of becoming a practical reality for the masses.
Consumers have never been able to purchase chicken and meat at these official rates as retailers refuse to sell these items at the prices set by the regulator. It will be again a testing time for Commissioner Karachi to set the new rates ahead of Ramazan.
Interestingly, the representatives of the Pakistan Poultry Association (PPA), poultry retailers and wholesalers, red meat associations, consumers’ protection bodies, etc – all of whom attended the March 18 meeting and praised the government – are now silent over the prevailing skyrocketing poultry and mutton rates.
Meanwhile, a message on the PPA website stated: “The Association has no role in the rate fixation of poultry and poultry products”. However, the association did not specify in what capacity did PPA Senior Vice Chairman Ghulam Khaliq attended the March 18 meeting.
On the other hand, the Meat Merchants Association (MMA) has rejected the price of mutton at Rs1,220 per kg.
MMA Chairman Haji Abdul Majeed, along with other office-bearers, said that Commissioner Karachi has unilaterally fixed the mutton rate instead of following the tradition of issuing the rate as per the rules of 1969.
He said as the rates of petroleum products have risen, the price of meat has also gone up given rising expenses. MMA had also tried to contain the price of livestock by suggesting the government various steps regarding cattle farming to control milk and meat prices, the association head said.
“The government did not pay any heed to the request while meat exports continued to soar, thus putting extra pressure on the price of red meat,” he added.
“The price of mutton has been fixed without taking MMA on board. As a result, heavy fines are being imposed on the retailers failing to comply with the official rate of mutton,” he added.
Consumers are dismayed by the failure of the government machinery in enforcing official rates for chicken and mutton. 
Meanwhile, the commissioner has urged citizens to lodge complaints at Helpline 1299, Commissioner Karachi’s website and Facebook page.
