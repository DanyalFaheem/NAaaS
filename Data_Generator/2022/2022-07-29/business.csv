0,"Gold price soars by Rs10,500 per tola in biggest single-day jump",Rupee plunges to 239.94 amid a dearth of dollar inflows...,"KARACHI:  As Pakistan’s economic woes remain far from being addressed, its  currency plunged to new lows against the dollar on Thursday while the gold  price saw a historic single-day rise of Rs10,500 per tola or Rs9,003 per  10 grams thanks to a $29 per ounce jump on world markets.
Meanwhile, the rupee lost anot­her Rs3.92 on a day-on-day basis to hit an all-time low  at Rs239.94 amid strong demand from importers.  
The  dollar’s appreciation continued as the State Bank of  Pakistan (SBP) and the government didn’t intervene to rescue the local  currency. 
The currency market did not take the assurances given by  Finance Minister Miftah Ismail seriously as the PMLN-led coalition  government has engaged the IMF from the very first day after coming to  power but couldn’t secure the release of a $1.17bn tranche so far even after  reaching a staff-level agreement on July 14. The Fund’s executive board  is expected to approve the tranche in its meeting likely to be held  anytime in August. 

Rupee plunges to 239.94 amid a dearth of dollar inflows

State Bank of Pakistan acting Governor Murtaza  Syed in an interview with a foreign newspaper said that Pakistan’s  economic problems are overblown. However, the speed of devaluation of  the local currency reflects the gravity of the situation particularly  when foreign exchange reserves are declining and inflows are not there. 
The  dollar price rose to Rs244 on Thursday in the open market from the previous  close of Rs241.
It was also noted that a grey market has appeared and  the currency is easily available at a higher price than the quoted prices in the licensed market. One can buy dollars at Rs4 to Rs6 per  dollar higher than the open market rates.  
Gold rally
The one-tola and 10-gram rates soared to record Rs162,500 and Rs139,318, respectively. 
In view of the persistent bullish trend on the world markets coupled with record rupee devaluation, All  Sindh Saraf and Jewellers Associ­ation (ASSJA) had first issued the rate  in the evening with a jump of Rs8,500 per tola and Rs7,288 per 10 grams  after a rise of $19 per ounce. Just after three minutes, the  association further raised the rates by Rs2,000 per tola and Rs1,715 per  10 grams, based on a further increase of $10 per ounce to $1,750.
This calendar year, the per-tola and 10-gram prices of gold surged by Rs36,300 and Rs31,122, respectively.
The  previous highest single-day increase was recorded at Rs3,000-4,000, but  today’s jump has so far been unbelievable at a time when the marriage  season is at its peak, said All Pakistan Jewellers Manufa­cturers  Association chairman  Mohammad Arshad.
He said a 22-karat three-gram gold ring now costs Rs35,000 while a 10-gram chain is being sold at  Rs140,000 which can only be afforded by filthy rich people.
He said the extraordinary  increase in gold rates usually lured investors who lift five to 10 tola  gold bars for investment purposes and cash them at a suitable time.
As  per data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the country’s gold  imports rose by 145pc in value to 363kg in FY22 valuing $22.6m versus  148kg amounting to $9m in FY21. Jewellery exports went up by 4.5pc to $14m in FY22 from $13.7m in FY21.  
SBP reserves fall $754m 
The foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)  further declined by $754m to $8.575bn due to debt repayments during the week ended on July 22.  
The holdings of the commercial banks during the week were $5.839bn while the country’s overall reserves fell to $14.414bn.

1,Berlitz to seek listing on Growth Enterprise Market board,"CLVL is acquiring 30pc shareholding in Berlitz against an investment of Rs30m, according to a recent regulatory filing.","KARACHI: Language-teaching institute Berlitz Pakistan is gearing up for a listing on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) counter of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in the next two years, Cordoba Logistics and Ventures Ltd (CLVL) Chairman Zeeshan Afzal told Dawn in an interview on Thursday.
CLVL is acquiring a 30 per cent shareholding in Berlitz Pakistan against an investment of Rs30 million, according to a recent regulatory filing.
Formerly known as Mian Textile Industries Ltd, publicly traded CLVL changed its business model last year and pivoted to logistics and startup investing. Its other startup investments are in online platform for shippers and carriers Trukkr, learning portal Investors Lounge and children’s clothing company Cotton Candy.
“We like to invest in ed-tech. Berlitz was very profitable in the pre-pandemic years. Corporate trainings came to a halt in Covid-19. But things are coming back to normal now as more and more corporate entities are going for employee training and development programmes,” said Mr Afzal.
He didn’t state the revenue or profit numbers for Berlitz, but acknowledged that its business was down to half the pre-Covid level. “We foresee a growth of four to five times in the coming years. Listing it on the GEM board will provide investors with a great opportunity to invest in ed-tech,” he said while referring to the newly established listing counter that’s dedicated to up-and-coming, riskier companies with high growth potential.
According to a recent research study by Technavio, the global corporate training arena is highly fragmented and consists equally of international and regional players. It expects the market segment to observe an incremental growth of over $46 billion between 2021 and 2026 worldwide, expanding at an annualised rate of 8.7pc.
Berlitz operates six centres in Pakistan with over 350 corporate clients. Most of these clients are multinational companies.
Mr Afzal said it was too early to write off the importance of brick-and-mortar–based learning platforms like Berlitz. A large number of Pakistanis still have no or inadequate access to the internet, he noted. “Having said that, I think technology will play a key role in the expansion of Berlitz into second-tier cities of Pakistan, including Sialkot, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and Multan,” he said.

2,S&P downgrades outlook on Pakistan’s long-term ratings to ‘negative’,"Pakistan’s external position weakens against the backdrop of higher commodity prices and a weakening rupee, it says.","KARACHI: After Moody’s and Fitch, the S&P Global Ratings on Thursday revised the outlook on Pakistan’s long-term ratings to negative from stable.  
The S&P affirmed its ‘B-’ long-term and ‘B’ short-term sovereign credit ratings on Pakistan, as well as ‘B-’ long-term issue rating on the country’s senior unsecured notes and Sukuk Trust Certificates. 
“Pakistan’s external position weakens against a backdrop of higher commodity prices, tighter global financial conditions, and a weakening rupee,” said the agency. 
The agency said that it could lower its ratings if Pakistan’s external indicators continued to deteriorate, but the outlook could be revi­sed to stable if its external position stabilises and improves.  
Evidence of improvement could include a sustained rise in usable foreign exchange reserves. Pakistan’s domestic demand continues to recover, it is now facing a new challenge in the form of rising prices, particularly for staple goods, said the agency. 
“Prevailing price dynamics, including costlier edible oils, fuel, electricity, and grains, are likely to hurt the pace of private consumption growth in the current fiscal year ending June 2023,” said the agency. 
“The Pakistan government has considerable external indebtedness and liquidity needs, and an elevated general government fiscal deficit and debt stock,” it said. 
“Prevailing price dynamics, including costlier edible oils, fuel, electricity, and grains, are likely to hurt the pace of private consumption growth in the current fiscal year ending June 2023,” it said. 
The S&P said while Pakistan’s domestic demand continues to recover, it is now facing a new challenge in the form of rising prices, particularly for staple goods. 
“Although the impact of these more difficult macroeconomic conditions has been partially mitigated by various reform initiatives undertaken by the government over the past few years, the risk of continued deterioration in key metrics, including external liquidity, is rising,” the agency said. 
“However, the current inflationary environment complicates the implementation of such policies. Achieving a primary fiscal balance surplus, and boosting its stock of foreign exchange reserves, will also be more difficult for the government to achieve against the current external backdrop,” said the agency. 
The S&P said that with parliamentary elections due by August 2023, political uncertainty will remain elevated over the coming quarters. 
It said that although Pakistan’s security situation has gradually improved over recent years, ongoing vulnerabilities weaken the government’s effectiveness and weigh on the business climate.

3,"Political turmoil intensifying market uncertainties, warns finance ministry","“Inflationary and external sector risks are building macroeconomic imbalances in the economy,"" the ministry says.","ISLAMABAD:  Painting an uncertain economic outlook, the Ministry of Finance on  Thursday warned that prevailing political unrest was causing governance  problems and intensifying the market uncertainties already caused by low  foreign exchange reserves and external pressures.
“Inflationary  and external sector risks are building macroeconomic imbalances in the  economy. Furthermore, the ongoing political unrest is increasing  economic uncertainty, which is causing the rupee to depreciate and has an  impact on the cost of production. All these factors are making the economic  outlook uncertain”, said the Economic Adviser’s Wing (EAW) of the Ministry  of Finance in its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for July. 
Read: Is the rupee too weak to recover?
It  said the high international prices were still adversely affecting  external positions even at the start of FY23. There was an intense  need for the successful completion of the IMF 7th and 8th reviews of  Pakistan’s Exte­nded Fund Facility (EFF). The government has taken all  difficult decisions to make reviews successful, reaching a staff-level  agreement for a $1.17bn loan tranche, the report said.
However,  ongoing political unrest is not only creating governance problems but on  the other hand, intensifying the uncertainties depicted by exchange  rate depreciation which will, in turn, impact the cost of production.  Halting investment decisions is further making the outlook blurry.
Read: The cost of political polarisation
The  update said the year-on-year inflation remained in double digits since November 2021 and will continue in July and hover around the  level observed in June due to the increase in international  commodity prices, particularly of energy, and the depreciation of the rupee. CPI Inflation was recorded at 21.3pc in June as against  9.7pc in the same month last year.
In June, the surge in imports  of goods owing to an increase in international commodity prices widened the trade deficit. Workers’ remittances were not enough to finance the trade  deficit, and as a result, the current account deficit (CAD) widened to $17.4bn last fiscal year.  However, it is expected that with the government’s policy measures, imports will fall, while the better performance of exports of goods and services and workers’ remittances will bring the CAD at a manageable level in the coming months.
The EAW said not only  international commodity prices, especially oil and food prices, but the  depreciation of the exchange rate influenced domestic inflation. It  conceded that inflation mostly in the last two months was also coming  from supply shocks whose impacts have overshadowed government efforts in  maintaining prices.
The higher interest rate followed by monetary  contraction was also adversely affecting the perception of the economic outlook. The recent cut in petroleum prices resulted in a decline in weekly SPI. But market expectations  and supply side factors are contributing to inflation.

6,Import ban on luxury items lifted,"Automobiles, cell phones and electronics excluded; petroleum dealers’ commission raised 70pc.","ISLAMABAD: The government has increased dealers’ commission on the sale of petroleum products by up to an unprecedented 70 per cent and lifted a ban imposed in May on the import of “non-essential and luxury items”, excluding automobiles, cell phones and electronics.
The decisions were taken on Thursday at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet presided over by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail. 
The committee also approved tenders for 200,000 tonnes of wheat at about $408 a tonne and allowed $11.6 million goodwill compensation for the Chinese casualities at the Dasu hydropower project in July last year. 
The meeting approved an increase of 70pc in the dealers’ commission on the sale of high-speed diesel (HSD) to Rs7 per litre from Rs4.13 at present. 

Automobiles, cell phones and electronics excluded; petroleum dealers’ commission raised 70pc

Likewise, it also increased the dealers’ commission on the sale of petrol by 43pc to Rs7 instead of Rs4.90 per litre at present. 
This is the steepest increase in margins allowed in one go in the country. The meeting was informed that dealers’ margin on the sale of HSD and petrol was also increased by more than 25pc with effect from December 2021. Put together, the commission has jumped 79pc and 112pc on petrol and HSD since then.
The increase was approved based on an agreement reached with dealers in 2018 by former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Minister of State for Petroleum Musadik Malik, who held the same post at the time. 
The meeting was told that dealers had threatened to go on strike and demanded about Rs14 per litre commission on both products, but it was brought down to Rs7. 
The ECC was told that oil marketing companies (OMCs) had demanded an increase in their margins to Rs7 per litre from the existing Rs3.68 on both products but this would be taken up separately so that benefit was given to dealers with effect from Aug 1 and OMCs on Sept 1 to increase prices in phases.
Import ban 
The ECC also lifted the ban on imported goods except for completed built units (CBUs) of automobiles, mobile phones and home appliances. 
The meeting was told the ban had helped cut the imports of banned items, which shrank by around 70pc from $399.4 million to $123.9 million between May 20 and July 19. 
Editorial: Lifting import ban
The major contributors to this reduction of about $275m were automobile and mobile phone CBUs, which had a share of 79pc in the total import reduction. The remaining 21pc reduction was spread over 810 tariff lines impacting multiple sectors of the economy, including foreign investments.
The ECC also decided that all held-up consignments (except items which still remain in the banned category) which arrived at the ports after July 1 should be cleared subject to payment of a 25pc surcharge. 
Wheat import 
The Ministry of National Food Security and Research submitted a summary on urgent advice relating to the award of the fourth International Wheat Tender 2022 opened on July 25. 
The tender was opened on July 25, in which six international suppliers participated, out of which five offered bid rates. The ECC approved the lowest bid offered by Falconbridge FZ LLC at the rate of $407.49 per tonne CFR bulk on a sight-letter-of-credit basis. 
The ECC also approved domestic gas supply to Fatima Fertiliser’s Sheikhupura plant and Agritech and advised the TCP to negotiate wheat imports from Russia at lower rates.
