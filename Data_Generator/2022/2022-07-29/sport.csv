0,"Waheed, Abdullah return negative Covid tests, set to feature in CWG opener","Pakistan, who are placed in Pool ‘A’, are due to face New Zealand on Sunday.","BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan’s hockey team was on Thursday boosted by the return of key players Rana Abdul Waheed and goalkeeper Mohammad Abdullah after they tested negative for Covid-19 with manager Sameer Hussain confirming that they were in line to feature against South Africa in their Commonwealth Games opener on Saturday. 
The duo had tested positive upon the team’s arrival in Birmingham for the Commonwealth Games, which were due to open later on Thursday. They were put in isolation and after every four hours their CT values was being monitored. 
“They have tested negative and joined the gym today … they will be part of the team for our opening match,” Sameer told APP. 
Pakistan, who are placed in Pool ‘A’, are due to face New Zealand on Sunday in their second match before taking on Scotland on Aug 3 and rounding off their first-stage campaign against six-time champions Australia. 
Having failed to qualify for next year’s World Cup and placed 18th in the world rankings, Sameer said he was happy with Pakistan’s underdog status and insisted the first goal was to qualify for the semi-finals after finishing among the top two in their pool. 
“We might be the lowest-ranked team in our group but I feel we have a highly-talented bunch of players, who on their day can spring a surprise,” the former Olympian said. 
“We didn’t play a lot of international hockey in recent years due to Covid-19 and other issues which is why our ranking has suffered. But we have a young squad with most of the players among those who made their debuts at the Asia Cup.” 
Pakistan failed to secure a top-four finish at the Asia Cup, missing out on the chance to qualify for the World Cup but Sameer reckons a good show at the Commonwealth Games would help improve the team’s ranking. 
“Our focus is to advance to the semi-finals,” he said. “We’ve analysed videos of other teams in our pool and have planned accordingly. We know our grey areas and have worked on them. 
“It is heartening that we have a pretty aggressive forward line, which has the ability to test any strong defence. We are also a solid defensive unit so it will be interesting to see how our young guns implement our plans.” 
Pakistan have never won a hockey gold at the Commonwealth Games with their best-placed finish coming at the 2006 edition when they got silver.

1,"Jayasuriya, Mendis spin Sri Lanka to series-levelling win over Pakistan",GALLE: Spinner Prabath Jayasuriya grabbed another five-wicket haul as Sri Lanka thumped Pakistan by 246 runs in the...,"GALLE: Spinner Prabath Jayasuriya grabbed another five-wicket haul as Sri Lanka thumped Pakistan by 246 runs in the second Test to end the series 1-1 on Thursday.
Chasing a mammoth 508 for victory, tourists Pakistan were bowled out for 261 in the second session on day five in Galle with skipper Babar Azam hitting a valiant 81.
The 30-year-old Jayasuriya, a left-arm spinner, claimed his fourth five-wicket haul in just his third Test since making his debut against Australia earlier this month. Fellow spinner Ramesh Mendis took four wickets.
Sri Lanka were racing to wrap up the match ahead of forecast rain after Pakistan resumed with nine wickets remaining and gamely fought on through the morning.
But Jayasuriya kept hitting back with regular strikes and got Salman Ali Agha out for four at the stroke of lunch, then trapped talisman Babar lbw to end Pakistan’s resistance.
“When Babar was dismissed we knew that we could pull this off. Babar is their anchor,” Jayasuriya, who has bagged 29 wickets in three Tests, told reporters.
“That was crucial and once he was out we knew we could pull it off.” 
Ramesh, who took five wickets with his off-spin in Pakistan’s first innings, wiped off the tail to trigger Sri Lankan celebrations in former captain Angelo Mathews’ 100th Test.
Pakistan won the opener with a Galle record chase of 342 and fought hard to outdo themselves, with the in-form Babar scoring his 23rd Test fifty and putting on brave stands with overnight partner Imam-ul-Haq (49) and Mohammad Rizwan (37).
Ramesh struck on his first ball of the day to get Imam caught behind, with the left-handed batsman adding just three to his overnight 46.
Jayasuriya, who took one wicket on day four, cut short Rizwan’s stay with his left-arm spin. Fawad Alam was run out for one.
Babar survived Jayasuriya’s lbw call, which was given out by the umpire but successfully reviewed by the batsman, before the bowler claimed him for the third time this series. 
“Definitely tough game for us. Batting wasn’t up to the mark,” said the Pakistan skipper.
Babar, who began the day on 26 and needed some physio help for lower back discomfort, has been in top form with the bat and scored 119 and 55 in Pakistan’s opening win. He was all praise for Jayasuriya and said the bowler’s “patience” impressed him the most. “He is an experienced bowler. The way he bowls with a consistent line with a lot of patience is the key,” said Babar of Sri Lanka’s destroyer-in-chief.  
“He keeps his area even after getting hit for a boundary, and that’s the good thing.”
Sri Lanka ended their innings on Wednesday afternoon with a monumental lead but weather was of concern to the hosts, with play ending early on day three and four due to bad light and rain predicted for Thursday afternoon.
Dhananjaya de Silva, who stood in as Sri Lanka captain with back pain keeping Dimuth Karunaratne off the field, set up victory with his 109 in Sri Lanka’s 360-8 declared.  
“We were definitely in the game but Dhananjaya’s innings changed the game,” said Babar.
Pakistan fell behind Sri Lanka by 147 runs after being bowled out for 231 in response to the hosts’ first-innings 378.
Back-to-back cricket tours have brought some joy to Sri Lanka, which is enduring a painful economic crisis and shortages of food and fuel.
Political unrest saw the president flee the country in between the Australia series, which also ended 1-1 after the hosts again bounced back from their opening loss.

2,Hemp says Pakistan women geared up for Barbados challenge,Cricket is returning to the Games for the first time since 1998 but it will be the first time women’s cricket will be part of it.,"BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan women’s cricket team coach David Hemp believes his players are ready to show their mettle in their opening match of the Commonwealth Games against Barbados at Edgbaston on Friday despite his side’s preparations having been hampered by rain. 
Cricket is returning to the Commonwealth Games for the first time since 1998 but it will be the first time women’s cricket will be part of the Games, with the T20 format to feature, and Pakistan will also face arch-rivals India and world champions Australia in Group ‘A’. 
The top two teams from the two groups advance to the semi-finals and Pakistan come into the Games shorn of match-practice after just one of their four matches during the tri-series in Ireland — which also features Australia — was completed. Rains also affected the national team’s camp in Islamabad earlier this month. 
“Unfortunately the matches in Ireland got curtailed due to the weather but we did manage to complete all practice sessions,” Hemp was quoted as saying in the Pakistan Cricket Board news release. 
“The players experiencing different conditions in the UK was a very valuable exercise.  
“Since arriving in Birmingham we have completed one practice session which was last night at Edgbaston and the players are really excited about the event. The game on Friday is what we have our eyes on. 
The match against Barbados will be a big challenge as they are a formidable unit as most of the players make-up the West Indies side. It is a great opportunity to play at a venue like Edgbaston and we hope the weather will be kind to us and we get to play all three pool games in the coming week.”

Jayasuriya claimed his fourth five-wicket haul in just his third Test to star in Sri Lanka’s 246-run win to end the two-Test series level at 1-1 in Galle.
He only made his debut, aged 30, earlier this month and the left-hander made an instant impact with a match haul of 12 wickets in a Sri Lanka victory over Australia.
Jayasuriya’s 29 red-ball wickets from his first three Tests is joint second in the all-time list, behind Indian leg-spinner Narendra Hirwani, who took a leading 31 in his first three Tests. 
“Captain has faith in me and hope I have delivered,” the unassuming Jayasuriya told reporters of skipper Dimuth Karunaratne.
Jayasuriya, who hails from Matale district in Central Province, made his Test debut after Sri Lanka’s team was struck by a Covid outbreak ahead of the second Australia Test.
He grabbed the opportunity with both hands to run through the tourists, picking six wickets in each innings.
Karunaratne said he spotted Jayasuriya in the domestic National Super League tournament and was immediately impressed. 
“I saw his potential,” said Karunaratne. “And we saw wh­at he could do in this series.” 
Jayasuriya is now the toast of Sri Lanka but he said he had initially struggled to find his footing after rising to first-class cricket from his rural hometown. 
“It’s been a tough journey,” he said. “I had to do everything on my own. You are all alone and finally you feel the pinch. 
“I didn’t tell too many things to (people back) home. Just kept it to myself and put my head down and played.” 
Jayasuriya got Pakistan skipper Babar Azam out three times in four innings during the series and in this match trapped the star batsman lbw on 81 to end Pakistan’s resistance in their chase of 508.
His danger ball remains the one that pitches and skids while the batsman plays it for the spin. “From my school days I took wickets from my arm ball,” said Jayasuriya. “I took 100 wickets in my last season. When the ball is turning, rather than getting wickets from the one that spins, you can take wickets with the straight one.”

Sri Lanka will, however, remain hosts for the nine-team tournament, which will be played between Aug. 27-Sept. 11 and serve as preparation for the Asian sides in the lead-up to the Twenty20 World Cup later this year.
The country of 22 million people has been crippled by an economic crisis, with shortages of fuel, food and other necessities. The Sri Lankan parliament on Wednesday approved the extension of a state of emergency for a month.
Shammi Silva, the president of Sri Lanka’s cricket board (SLC) said they “fully stand by the ACC’s decision” to relocate the tournament. 
“Every effort was made to host the Asia Cup in Sri Lanka and the decision to shift the venue to the UAE was taken after much deliberation,” ACC president Jay Shah said in a statement. 
“The UAE will be the new venue while Sri Lanka will continue to retain hosting rights. This edition of the Asia Cup is extremely important as it will help Asian nations prepare for the ICC World Cup.”

5,Bairstow gives England perfect start in SA T20 series,BRISTOL: Jonny Bairstow’s excellent season continued as he made 90 in England’s 41-run win over South Africa in...,"BRISTOL: Jonny Bairstow’s excellent season continued as he made 90 in England’s 41-run win over South Africa in the 1st T20 international at Bristol on Wednesday.
Moeen Ali compiled England’s quickest T20 fifty, off just 16 balls, in the hosts’ 234-6 — their second highest total at this level behind the 241-3 they posted against New Zealand at Napier in 2019.
“It was a great performance, what we’ve been looking for, a brilliant total, we were under threat for a while but delighted with the win,” England T20 captain Jos Buttler told Sky Sports.
Moeen, the player of the match, added: “Generally I back myself, try to see it and hit it. Jonny is so powerful, I try to remind him of the good things he does.” But amid the 20 sixes in England’s innings, Proteas quick Lungi Ngidi took an excellent 5-39, his career best T20 international figures.
England’s Reece Topley then struck twice in the second over to reduce South Africa to 7-2, the in-form left-arm quick removing dangerman Quinton de Kock and Rilee Rossouw.
South Africa were 86-4 in the 10th over, with Reeza Hendricks having made 57 off 33 balls, when Tristan Stubbs hauled them back into the game with a brilliant maiden T20 international fifty off just 19 balls, including six soaring sixes.
Even allowing for a good pitch and a relatively small ground, it was a superb display of ball-striking by the 21-year-old Stubbs.
But with South Africa needing 54 off 18 balls, paceman Chris Jordan conceded just three runs, with Andile Phehlukwayo defeated by several yorkers.
It was a decisive over, with South Africa also paying dearly for several fielding errors earlier in the match.
“CJ (Jordan) changed the momentum of the game, a brilliant over,” said Buttler.
Stubbs launched Richard Gleeson to long-off as a brilliant innings of 72 off just 28 balls came to an end, with South Africa finishing on 193-8.
“They demolished us in the last 10 (overs) but we dropped four or five catches which cost us massively in the field,” said South Africa T20 captain David Miller.
“It was a phenomenal knock by Stubbsy, an extremely disappointing result but there’s another two (matches) to get it right.” The last thing South Africa needed to do was help Bairstow on his way.
But in his first short-form appearance for eight months, he was missed on 12, 57 and 72 as Heinrich Klaasen, Rossouw and Hendricks fumbled catches in the deep.
Bairstow had his first reprieve when Klaasen misjudged a chance off Tabraiz Shamsi, losing sight of the ball as it cleared him for six.
Left-arm wrist-spinner Shamsi conceded 19 runs in the 10th over, with both Dawid Malan (43) and Bairstow hitting him for six.
The wheels came off for South Africa during a 17th over where Phehlukwayo conceded 33 runs.
Bairstow hit the first two balls for six, watched two wides go by, was dropped off the third legal delivery before Moeen hit three more sixes to the delight of the crowd.
But no sooner had Moeen made fifty, he was caught behind off Ngidi to end a fourth-wicket stand of 106 in 37 balls.
Bairstow was 10 runs shy of three figures with two balls of the innings remaining when he skyed Ngidi into the legside only for Rossouw to hold the catch on this occasion.
He faced 53 balls, including three fours and eight sixes.

6,Zverev return ‘more realistic’ for Davis Cup in September,BERLIN: Alexander Zverev has not given up hope of playing next month’s US Open but the German world number two is...,"BERLIN: Alexander Zverev has not given up hope of playing next month’s US Open but the German world number two is more likely to return to action from his ankle injury during the group stage of the Davis Cup Finals in mid-September.
Zverev was forced to retire after suffering an injury during his French Open semi-final against Rafael Nadal and had surgery on torn ligaments in his right ankle last month.
The 25-year-old has yet to be ruled out of the year’s final Grand Slam, which starts on Aug 29 on the hardcourts of Flushing Meadows in New York.
“Sascha is recovering well and is still hoping that he can be ready for the U.S. Open,” a spokesperson for Zverev said.  “However, it is still too early to tell if he will be able to compete there or not.”
This month, Zverev, who finished runner-up at the 2020 US Open, posted a video on social media in which he was seen walking without crutches. This week, he confirmed his participation in the Oct 3-10 Japan Open in Tokyo.
But Olympic singles champion Zverev is targeting an earlier return to competitive action, aiming to lead Germany’s campaign in the group stage of the Davis Cup, on Sept 13-18.
Germany will play their matches at home in Hamburg with France, Belgium and Australia the other teams in Group ‘C’. Two teams from each of the four groups will advance to the quarter-finals of this year’s men’s team event.
“Davis Cup in Hamburg in September seems more realistic but we keep our fingers crossed that he will be ready earlier,” the spokesperson said on email.  “Therefore, he should be able to play a few events before Tokyo.”

7,"Gill, Chahal lead India to series win over Windies",PORT OF SPAIN: India underlined their strength in depth with a crushing 119-run victory over the West Indies on DLS...,"PORT OF SPAIN: India underlined their strength in depth with a crushing 119-run victory over the West Indies on DLS method in the rain-effected third and final One-Day International at Queen’s Park Oval in Trinidad.
Opening batsman Shubman Gill was left stranded two runs short of a maiden senior international century as rain ended the visitors’ innings at 225 for three off 36 batting first.
Set a revised target of 257 off 35 overs, the home side crumbled to 137 all out off 26 overs with leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal leading the rout with figures of four for 17.
Missing seven first-choice players for this Caribbean journey, India completed a 3-0 sweep and also extended their winning run in ODI campaigns to 12 series.
For the West Indies, who came very close to upsetting India in the first two matches at the same venue, this was their ninth consecutive ODI loss.
It also leaves them with much work to do ahead of a three-match series against New Zealand next month when World Cup qualifying points will be at stake.
Gill, who was named both man of the match and man of the series, played fluently from the outset for a run-a-ball 98, putting on 113 with opening partner and captain Shikhar Dhawan (58) and then 86 with the energetic Shreyas Iyer (44).
But he slowed within sight of the elusive three figures and was left frustrated when showers returned to end the innings. 
“It wasn’t meant to be but I am generally pleased with my performances today and in the three matches,” said Gill after the match. 
“Still, I was just hoping to get one more over to get a chance at completing the hundred.” 
Hayden Walsh was the most successful of the West Indies bowlers with two wickets while fellow spinner Akeal Hosein claimed the other.
Facing a daunting challenge, the hosts were rocked onto the back foot immediately as Mohammed Siraj removed Kyle Mayers and Shamarh Brooks before a run was scored.
Brandon King and captain Nicholas Pooran contributed 42 apiece but it was never going to be enough against a supremely confident Indian side as leg-spinner Chahal enjoyed a late feast to seal a comprehensive triumph. 
“We knew that target would be a challenge and really didn’t put it together as we should have in the top order to have a chance,” said Pooran his side’s batting effort. 
“Taking on a team of the quality of India it has helped our young players develop though in understanding what is required to succeed eventually in the ODI format.”

8,Four-time world champion Vettel to retire from F1,His 53 Grand Prix victories place him third on the all-time list behind Lewis Hamilton and Michael Schumacher.,"HUNGARORING: Four-time Formula One world champion Sebastian Vettel will retire at the end of the 2022 season, he announced on Thursday. 
“The decision to retire has been a difficult one for me to take, and I have spent a lot of time thinking about it,” Vettel, 35, said in an Aston Martin team statement. 
“At the end of the year I want to take some more time to reflect on what I will focus on next; it is very clear to me that, being a father, I want to spend more time with my family. But today is not about saying goodbye. 
“Rather, it is about saying thank you — to everyone — not least to the fans, without whose passionate support Formula One could not exist.” Vettel won four successive championships with Red Bull from 2010 to 2013, but struggled to reproduce his best results after moving to Ferrari before joining Aston Martin last year.
His 53 Grand Prix victories place him third on the all-time list behind Lewis Hamilton (103) and Michael Schumacher (91). Vettel last won a race in Singapore in 2019. 
“He is one of the all-time greats of Formula One, and it has been a privilege to have been able to work with him,” said Aston Martin executive chairman Lawrence Stroll, whose son Lance is the team’s other driver. 
“He will continue to race for us up to and including the 2022 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, which will be his 300th Grand Prix entry. We will give him a fabulous send-off.” 
The German made his F1 debut with BMW Sauber at the United States Grand Prix in 2007. He joined Toro Rosso that same year and raced the final seven races of the season.
He then spent a full season with Toro Rosso before making the step up to Red Bull in 2009.
Vettel’s first title in 2010, aged 23 years and 134 days, saw him become the youngest world champion in history.
He moved to Aston Martin last season after six years at Ferrari, with whom he twice finished runner-up for the world title to Hamilton in 2017 and 2018.
Vettel trailed in 12th in the 2021 drivers’ championshp with his new team after achieving just one podium finish. He is 14th in the standings this season with just 15 points and missed the first two races with Covid-19. 
“Although our results have not been as good as we had hoped, it is very clear to me that everything is being put together that a team needs to race at the very highest level for years to come,” said Vettel. 
“I hope that the work I did last year and am continuing to do this year will be helpful in the development of a team that will win in the future, and I will work as hard as I can between now and the end of the year with that goal in mind, giving as always my best in the last 10 races.”

Omar, who became the first golfer from Pakistan to make the cut for a USGA championship, struggled with his putter on lightning fast Bandon Dunes greens. Pinckes won 4 and 3 after the 15th hole to enter the Round of 32.
“It just wasn’t my day,” said Omar, who was two down after the first four holes. “The greens were extra fast and the tees were placed right at the back. And my putts weren’t going in.
“I was unable to give my best today. But it was my first ever tournament in the US so I’m happy that I made the cut,” he added.
The US Amateur is regarded as the toughest and most prestigious junior contest in international golf. It features 264 of the best players from around the world. Past winners include Tiger Woods, Jordan Spieth and current world number one Scottie Scheffler.

11,Javelin world champ Barber Covid positive ahead of CWG,SYDNEY: Javelin world champion Kelsey-Lee Barber’s bid to also win the Commonwealth title was dealt a blow...,"SYDNEY: Javelin world champion Kelsey-Lee Barber’s bid to also win the Commonwealth title was dealt a blow Thursday, with the Australian testing positive for Covid-19, team officials said.
Barber, who claimed her second world crown last week at Eugene, Oregon in the United States, tested positive at the Australian team camp ahead of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham this week.
But with the women’s javelin final not until August 7, she could still compete.
“Kelsey-Lee Barber is not out [of the Games],” the team’s high-performance manager Andrew Faichney told Australian media.
“I have to reconfirm, but I think the organising committee has said that if an athlete is well and healthy enough, then they are going to be able to compete, and so that is what we are working through.”
Barber, who won bronze at the Tokyo Olympics, retained her world title with a throw of 66.91 metres, ahead of American Kara Winger and Japan’s Haruka Kitaguchi.
She was considered a strong favourite in Birmingham after winning bronze and silver at the past two editions of the Commonwealth Games.
Faichney also told local media that Olympic bronze medal-winning decathlete Ash Moloney would miss the Commonwealth Games.
Moloney was forced to withdraw from the world championships last week due to a knee injury and has not recovered.

13,UEFA to launch disciplinary probe over ‘Putin’ chants at CL qualifier in Istanbul,ANKARA: UEFA said on Thursday it will start a disciplinary investigation against Turkey’s Fenerbahce over a group...,"ANKARA: UEFA said on Thursday it will start a disciplinary investigation against Turkey’s Fenerbahce over a group of its fans chanting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s name after conceding a goal at home to Dynamo Kiev in a Champions League qualifier.
Fenerbahce’s hopes of competing in Europe’s elite Champions League competition this season were dashed by a 2-1 extra-time loss to Kiev in the second qualifying round tie in Istanbul on Wednesday.
Vitaliy Buyalskyi put the Ukrainian side ahead in the 57th minute, shortly after Fenerbahce midfielder Ismail Yuksek was sent off in a tense match.
The game ended 1-1 after 90 minutes but Kiev knocked out Fenerbahce with a 114th-minute winner by Oleksandr Karavaev.
Buyalskyi’s celebration after scoring was met with chants of “Vladimir Putin” by many Fenerbahce fans, prompting an online backlash condemning the Istanbul side’s fans and calling on European governing body UEFA to take action against the club.
UEFA said an “Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector will conduct a disciplinary investigation regarding alleged misbehaviour of Fenerbahce supporters” at the Dynamo Kiev match, adding further information would be made available later.
Vasyl Bodnar, Ukrainian Ambassador to Ankara, said on Twitter he was saddened by the chants but thanked those who stood against the  “inappropriate actions” of the fans.  “Football is a fair game. Dynamo Kiev was stronger yesterday,” he said.
Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 24, calling it a  “special military operation” to rid Ukraine of fascists, an assertion the Ukrainian government and its Western allies said was a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war.
Bodnar added that it was “very saddening” to hear the reaction of the Fenerbahce fans at a time when civilians in Ukraine were dying in Russian attacks on the country.
The Russian embassy declined to comment.
In a statement on Thursday, Fenerbahce said the chants made by “some” fans did not represent the club, its position, or its views, adding that it stood firmly against the war in Ukraine.
Fenerbahce said the chants lasted 20 seconds and were prompted by the “exaggerated” celebrations of some Kyiv players after the goal.
“Whatever the reason may be, we as the Fenerbahce Sport Club absolutely reject the reaction coming from parts of our stands,” the club said, adding it was unfair to put blame on all its fans or the club for an act that “never represents our values.”
Putin’s name is associated in Kiev with both the five-month invasion and a Kremlin-backed separatist conflict that has claimed more than 14,000 lives in Ukraine’s southeast since 2014.
Putin now questions the Ukrainian nation’s right to exist and brands its leaders as “Nazis” who must be deposed.
Dynamo’s irate Romanian coach Mircea Lucescu refused to attend the mandatory post-match press conference in protest at the chant.
“I did not expect such a chant,” he said in a statement released to Turkish media. “It is a pity.”
Turkey is generally popular among many Ukrainians because of its military support for Kiev’s Western-backed government.
The Ukrainian army has used Turkey’s Bayraktar TB2 combat drones to attack Russian armoured columns and slow the Kremlin’s push into the Donbas war zone in the east.
Ukraine now has a “Bayraktar” radio station and the drones feature in popular songs.
The private company said on Thursday it was donating another drone to Ukraine in response to a fundraising effort in Poland aimed at collecting millions of dollars for the purchase of one of the unmanned aerial vehicles on Kiev’s behalf.
The Ukrainian ambassador thanked Turkey’s drone makers in another tweet.
“Bayraktar will remain a symbol of friendship between our countries for many years,” Bodnar wrote.
But Turkish media report that Putin has suggested to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that Russia — in search of better combat drone support — start producing the Bayraktars to help its own war effort.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not deny the offer when asked about it by reporters on Wednesday.
“Military and technological cooperation is always on the two countries’ agenda,” Peskov said.
