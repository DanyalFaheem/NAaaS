1,Impasse over privatisation of Jinnah Convention Centre ends,Privatisation Commission agrees to formulate revised transaction structure in consultation with CDA...,"ISLAMABAD: The longstanding impasse between the Privatisation Commission and the Capital Development Authority (CDA) over the privatisation of Jinnah Convention Centre (JCC) was finally resolved on Thursday as it was agreed that a revised transaction structure will be formulated in consultation with the civic agency.
Minister for Privatisation Abid Hussain Bhayo held a detailed meeting with CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmad and both sides agreed to formulate a revised transaction structure from the transaction committee of the Privatisation Commission in consultation with the CDA, considering the environmental effects and other possibilities for turning around the loss-making entity into a profit making one.
In the real estate sector, JCC remains the only transaction yet to be completed. The PTI government had auctioned the Services International Hotel in Lahore and properties owned and controlled by the federal government.
The revision of transaction structure would involve carrying out new feasibility studies considering various factors keeping in view of the location of the centre.

Privatisation Commission agrees to formulate revised transaction structure in consultation with CDA

Speaking to the CDA chairman, the privatisation minister said: “We must move in manner to ensure transparency on the one hand and providing viable options for the potential investors on the other.”
During the meeting, the CDA chairman endorsed the output from Privatisation Commission and committed to assisting in all matters for the early resolution of issues delaying the privatisation of the centre.
The meeting was held in the backdrop of reservations of the CDA board regarding a few aspects of the transaction structure and a way forward to convert the loss-making entity into profit-making through a consultative process.
Following approval by the federal cabinet, the Privatisation Commission moved with the issuance of ‘expression of interest’ and 12 parties were pre-qualified. But the process could not move ahead on account of reservations of a couple of CDA board members on the conversion of the entire property from amenity to commercial.
The federal government intended to sell JCC through a competitive bidding process. The centre is located on 7.59 acres, including the built-up structure on 4.13 acres.
Though the federal cabinet had approved the privatisation of the centre, the CDA had objected to it on the ground that the existing footprint area should be kept intact. The board had maintained that the CDA regulations and bylaws should be made applicable.
The Privatisation Commission had turned down all objections raised by CDA, stating that the civic agency had no objection as the privatisation of the JCC had been approved by the cabinet along with the building bylaws for the transaction structure.
The commission had also stated that the price consideration of Rs1.14 billion had already been paid by the Ministry of Interior, and the plot no longer belonged to the CDA.
Following privatisation of the centre, investors would have the option to retain the current structure to develop a convention centre, hotel or office space or apartments. 
The investor would also have the right to sell the built-up units of the property.
Jinnah Convention Centre, located on Srinagar Highway, was built in 1979. The building was handed over to the CDA in 2000 for administration and maintenance. In 2019, the CDA leased out the centre’s land to the interior ministry for a period of 99 years.

5,Pakistan facing high hepatitis disease burden,Around 15m people are estimated to be infected with viral hepatitis C and another 5m with viral hepatitis B in Pakistan.,"ISLAMABAD: While the hepatitis day is observed across the globe on July 28, Pakistan is facing a considerable high disease burden due to the viral hepatitis B and C.
Around 15 million people are estimated to be infected with viral hepatitis C and another five million with viral hepatitis B in Pakistan.
In a message, President Dr Arif Alvi said according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one person dies every 30 seconds due to a hepatitis-related illness. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), 80pc of the hepatitis C disease burden lies in Egypt and Pakistan. As of 2021 estimates, one in every 13 adult Pakistanis is hepatitis C positive. There are about 9,775,000 people living with hepatitis C and around 27,000 die each year due to its complications.
“Fortunately, direct acting antiviral medicines can cure HCV infection in adults within 12 weeks and Pakistan is producing these medicines at very affordable prices. The cure rate of these medicines is 97-98pc which is similar to that seen around the globe. Hepatitis C elimination is, therefore, a low-hanging fruit which is not only possible but also feasible for Pakistan,” he added.

Fortunately, we are producing drugs which can cure viral hepatitis C infection within 12 weeks, says president

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said the government had set a target to eliminate the disease by 2030 and was making arrangements to carry out screening to identify the patients.
Gastroenterologist Dr Waseem Khawaja while talking to Dawn said: “There are five types of hepatitis, from A to E. However, Hepatitis C is the leading cause of death all over the world.”
He said people should ensure vaccination of hepatitis for their children. Cleanliness and sterilised instruments play a vital role in avoiding the disease. Unscreened blood and blood products should not be used, he said.
Dr Khawaja said polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyping were the main tests to decide whether the patient needed treatment or not and for how long the treatment was required.
An event was organised at Maroof International Hospital which was attended by representatives from international organisations, including WHO, Unicef and the Australian High Commission.
Chairman Senate Standing Committee on Health Senator Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, while speaking on the occasion, said the major focus was on the health sector during the tenure of the PTI government.
Chief Executive Officer of the hospital Haroon Naseer said every day should be observed as a hepatitis day.
A statement issued by the WHO said viral hepatitis affects 360 million people worldwide and claims 3,000 lives every day. In 2015, the World Health Assembly adopted a strategy to eliminate hepatitis by 2030 through prevention, testing and treatment.
“Primary healthcare is an essential pillar of universal health coverage, and hepatitis services, including testing, treatment and prevention, need to be integrated within it. Bringing hepatitis care closer to communities will secure prevention services for those at higher risk for hepatitis,” it stated.
Meanwhile, the District Health Office held an awareness session at Gokina in connection with the day.
DHO Dr Zaeem Zia said: “We can’t wait for a world free of hepatitis.”
Meanwhile, Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA) organised public awareness programmes across the country. Awareness desks for the general public were set up and banners were displayed in different hospitals in Islamabad, including Pims, CDA Hospital and Polyclinic.
In Rawalpindi, a walk was held here at Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU) to mark the day. 
A large number of doctors, paramedical staff and others attended the walk.
Speaking on the occasion, RMU Vice Chancellor Dr. Mohammad Umer said that every third person of 10 in Pakistan was infected with hepatitis A or E, the most common variants which spread through contaminated water, adulterated food, reuse of hypodermic needles, blades, and unsterilised surgical equipment.
He said blood transfusion without getting it screened was also a leading cause of the spread of this virus to a healthy person.
Earlier, speaking on the occasion, District Health Authority Chief Executive Officer Dr Lubna Ishaque said about 15 million people were suffering from hepatitis B and C in Pakistan, and around 150,000 new cases were added annually.
She said the wide-ranging effort was urgently needed to prevent millions of new infections and increasing deaths, while hepatitis C in the country was around 5 per cent and hepatitis B was nearly 2.5 per cent.

9,Kahuta and Chak Jalaldin become hotspots for dengue cases,RAWALPINDI: The District Health Authority (DHA) has observed Kahuta and Chak Jalaldin to be hotspots for dengue ...,"RAWALPINDI: The District Health Authority (DHA) has observed Kahuta and Chak Jalaldin to be hotspots for dengue cases as 10 patients reported to hospitals from these areas in the last one week.
Of the total 21 cases in the district so far this year, 11 were reported between January and June and 10 in the last one week - all from Kahuta and Chak Jalaldin.
District Coordinator Epidemics Prevention and Control Dr Sajjad Mehmood told Dawn that this year most of the patients were coming from Kahuta and Chak Jalaldin, adding in the past urban areas used to be the hotspots.
He said in Kahuta, people stored rainwater for drinking and other purposes and the dengue larvae were found there. Teams have been sent to clear the areas from dengue mosquitoes, he added.
He said the health authority was working to ensure preventive measures and kill the dengue larvae, but the rains had hampered its efforts. He said the recent rains had put the health authority in a difficult situation.
Dr Mehmood said on the directives of Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal, 4,000 focal persons had been appointed in the public and private sectors, who were responsible to remove stagnant water in their respective areas.
All departments were helping the health department in its efforts to check the spread of dengue. He said the government had provided 25 de-watering sets to the health department to drain out water from different places.
He said the health authority had also asked cantonment and city authorities and Pakistan railways to improve the sanitation condition in their respective areas and colonies and drain out water from vacant plots.
He said around 90 dengue fever suspects had been brought to the district’s health facilities during the last 24 hours, out of which one tested positive at the Holy Family Hospital, three were probable and one was non-dengue.
He said Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Kallar Syedan had registered 27 suspected dengue patients, District Headquarters Hospital 15, Holy Family Hospital 14, Wah General Hospital eight, THQ hospitals Kahuta and Gujar Khan six and THQ Kotli Sattian five cases in the last 24 hours.
Moreover, THQ hospitals Murree and Taxila have listed four suspects. Dr Mehmood said it would be premature to say if the number of dengue patients had increased this year.
“We will be in a position in next two weeks to say if the number of patients has increased or not,” he said.
“We have made arrangements to deal with any situation. There are enough medicines in the health facilities in the tehsils and the three main hospitals in Rawalpindi where dengue wards have been made operational,” he said.

However, sources said that printing of English book of class eight could face delay as its No-Objection Certificate (NOC) is yet to be issued by National Curriculum Council (NCC). 
However, an official of education ministry told Dawn that NOC of English for class eight will be issued in next couple of days.
Sources said that the NOC for Islamiat also faced delay, however, it has been issued and now Islamiat books are being printed.
“Yes, there was an issue with Islamiat and English. We have issued NOC of Islamiat and English for six and seven. Hopefully, in next two days, the NOC for class eight will also be issued,” said an official of the education ministry.

NOC for printing of Class VIII English book has yet to be issued by Curriculum Council

He said that process to supply books except for Islamiat and English has been started and Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) has received many titles of books so far.
“The FDE has been receiving loaded trucks of books on daily basis,” the official said and added that ministry is hopeful that during first week of August, the schools will receive all titles of books. Previous PTI government had introduced Single National Curriculum (SNC) for class one to eight. 
Last year, the SNC was introduced from class one to five and this year the government is going to introduce it from class six to eight.
However, the federal government had decided that the new syllabus from class six to eight will not be called SNC rather it will be called as National Curriculum of Pakistan (NCP).
“The National Curriculum of Pakistan (NCP) is the new name of the curriculum reforms,” Federal Education Minster Rana Tanveer Hussain said recently.
Addressing a workshop in Islamabad, the minister had said “the word ‘single’ caused confusion and excluded the diversity education that is an asset to our country’s rich heritage. We are now ready for getting back on track.”
Sources in education ministry said that NCP based books will be introduced in Islamabad’s schools with mention of NCP while in KP the same books will be available with mention on their cover page as SNC. 
Whereas, the sources said that the new books based on NCP/SNC will also be introduced in Gilgit-Baltistan this year.
The sources said that AJK and Balochistan have introduced SNC based book this year and from next year they will introduce the said books for grade five to eight as well.
Asked about Punjab and Sindh, the source said that since there was no cabinet intact in Punjab due to tussle between PTI and PML-N from April to July, that’s why a decision was not taken by Punjab for introducing new syllabus from six to eight. 
“Now, from next academic session, they [Punjab] will introduce the new syllabus and books for class six to eight. While, last year they had already introduced SNC based books from one to five,” said an official of education ministry.
The official said Sindh had already refused to adopt SNC even at primary level by stating that their own syllabus is updated and well designed while, they were also saying that after 18th constitutional amendment, preparation of syllabus is a provincial subject.
