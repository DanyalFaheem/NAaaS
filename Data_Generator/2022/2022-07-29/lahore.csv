He said the Ehsaas Programme, suspended by the previous PML-N government, would also be revived.
Speaking to media persons here on Thursday, Mr Habib said Hamza Shehbaz remained Punjab chief minister on ‘sympathetic’ grounds but took grossly wrong decisions and eventually people rejected him in the province. Now, he said, the Pakistani nation would make Imran Khan prime minister.
In the PML-N government, he said, the dollar price increased by Rs60 but its leaders were busy in getting their cases closed.
Answering a question, Mr Habib said the PTI was not facing foreign funding case but banned funding case. He challenged that the PTI neither got funding from Israel nor India. On the other hand, he said, the PML-N leadership had deep relations with India and party leaders were also paying visits to Israel.  
He said the PML-N leadership should explain [alleged] funding it received from Osama Bin Laden.
Mr Habib demanded that the Election Commission should not give preferential treatment to the PML-N and PPP and added that these parties’ leadership should be held accountable in the Supreme Court.

4,Traders protest collection of ST through electricity bills,LAHORE: Traders protested in Lahore and other parts of the province after they received electricity bills with sales...,"LAHORE: Traders protested in Lahore and other parts of the province after they received electricity bills with sales tax and other fees.
In various protests, including three in Lahore, shopkeepers set the printouts of their commercial electricity bills on fire and criticised the Shehbaz government for destructing the businesses while fulfilling the demands of the IMF for getting the loan approved.
“We reject the imposition of this huge and forced sales tax imposed on us through electricity bills. We will extend our protest soon by closing our shops across the markets,” threatened a trader at a demonstration by the traders at Shahalam Market. 
“Please stop assassinating us economically; stop such tactics of receiving unjustified tax from us.” 
The protesters, while carrying and showing their bills, chanted slogans against the Shehbaz government for damaging their businesses through unfair taxes.  
According to All Pakistan Anjuman Tajiran’s Naeem Mir, protests erupted across the province.
“In Lahore alone, protests were held at Shahalam Market, Anarkali and Chungi Amar Sadhu. Similarly, the protests were also reported to be organised in Multan, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi and other major cities against the inflated bills and other issues being faced by the traders at large,” he explained while talking to Dawn. 
He also criticised Minister for Finance Miftah Ismail for causing a hike in the dollar exchange rate. He said the dollar was being sold in the black by the banks while Mr Miftah had miserably failed to control the situation. 
He rejected the imposition of sales tax on electricity bills of commercial connections, stating that important and difficult decisions were being taken by the finance minister without consulting the stakeholders. 
He demanded that the government tax only those commercial consumers using electricity over 1,200 units. 
“PM Shehbaz Sharif must intervene in the issues immediately and give relief to the business community rather than making the situation tough for it,” he demanded.

5,Punjab Assembly speaker election today,PTI's Sibtain Khan and PML-N's Saiful Malook Khokhar in the run for the contest.,"LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly is set to elect its new speaker on Friday (today) as both the ruling coalition and the opposition alliance have pitched their candidates for the coveted post. 
The House in its proceedings on Thursday adopted a resolution seeking suspension of the assembly rules that authorise the governor to summon a session for the contest and also holding a vote of no-confidence against Deputy Speaker Sardar Dost Muhammad Mazari at 4pm on Friday. 
Sibtain Khan, the PTI lawmaker from Mianwali, has been nominated by the ruling coalition comprising PTI and PML-Q for the office of the speaker, which fell vacant due to the election of Parvez Elahi, the previous holder of the post, as chief minister. Opposition parties PML-N and PPP have fielded Saiful Malook Khokhar as their joint candidate. 
Nomination papers of both the contestants were cleared after scrutiny by newly-appointed assembly secretary Inayatullah Lak. His predecessor Muhammad Khan Bhatti was transferred and posted as principal secretary to the chief minister in an unprecedented move as no assembly service officer has ever been sent on deputation to general service post. 
Earlier, a sitting of the longest session of the assembly was held with Panel of Chairman Wasim Badozai in the chair in which former law minister Raja Basharat tabled a resolution to suspend the rules of business for holding polls for the seat of speaker and for no-confidence vote against Deputy Speaker Sardar Dost Muhammad Mazari on Friday afternoon. The motion was adopted with a majority vote. 
After reading out the procedure for the election of the new speaker, Mr Badozai put off the proceedings for Friday afternoon. 
Sibtain Khan told the media that the PML-N would fail to stage any upset during the poll for speaker and hoped that he would easily win the contest. He said everyone saw what happened with the letter (of PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat) that the N-League had brought to win the CM’s poll.

6,Indus area gangs pose challenge to police,RAHIM YAR KHAN: Police of two neighbouring districts -- Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur -- are still making strategies ...,"RAHIM YAR KHAN: Police of two neighbouring districts -- Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur -- are still making strategies to eliminate gangs of dacoits in the katcha area (riverbed) of the Indus river.  
The district police officers are making joint efforts to tackle the Lund, Janu Indhar, Shar, Lathani, Bakhrani, Sikhani, Dolani, Pat Imrani, Dashti and Bannu gangs which are notorious for kidnap for ransom in the katcha area. 
The kidnap for ransom incidents have increased in the last seven months and the victims, in some cases, have returned home after paying large amounts to these gangs. PTV news journalist Sher Muhammad Sahi paid Rs3 million to secure his release.  
Three DPOs of Rahim Yar Khan were transferred during the last one year but none of them could counter the criminal activities of the gangs. A political figure from Nawazabad area of Sadiqabad tehsil is on the hit list of Indhar gang for supporting the family of nine people who were gunned down by the gang at Chowk Mahi in October 2021.  
According to the residents, the dacoits have hideouts in islands in the Indus. They have the latest weapons including rocket launchers and ant-aircraft guns. A few years ago when kidnap for ransom was at its peak by notorious Chhottu gang, operations by police of Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Ghotki of Sindh proved insufficient and at last, an army operation was conducted after which the gangsters surrendered.  
RYK DPO Akhtar Farooq’s spokesperson Saif Ali Wains claimed that the criminal activities of dacoits in the katcha area had been reduced due to better strategy of police. He said police had established 42 pickets at the entry and exit points and 800 police employees were performing duties in rotation.  
He said 38 elite teams on their vehicles patrolled the area. Police were also adopting secret vigilance at these pickets and with the good coordination of the Rajanpur and Sindh police, meetings were in progress to defeat the criminals.  
During the crackdown of the RYK police and after an exchange of fire, seven kidnapped people were rescued and 130 facilitators arrested, Wains said. 
He said DPO Akhtar Farooq and SP Investigation Dost Muhammad regularly visited the pickets in the katcha area. He said a grand operation was on the cards.

7,LCCI team raises post-budget issues with governor,LAHORE: The business community on Thursday lodged a stack of complaints with the Punjab governor against the...,"LAHORE: The business community on Thursday lodged a stack of complaints with the Punjab governor against the government for creating various issues, including exploitation by banks over the dollar exchange rates, hindering growth of businesses across the country. 
“The commercial banks are exploiting the business community by demanding Rs10 to 15 over and above the inter-bank dollar rate for releasing the import shipment documents. Therefore, the State Bank should immediately intervene in the issue, provide its full oversight and ensure release of the documents by banks at the inter-bank rate,” complained Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) President Mian Nauman Kabir in a meeting with Governor Muhammad Balighur Rehman while heading a delegation of the office-bearers and the business community representatives.
“We request you to take up the issue with the State Bank of Pakistan at your earliest. Moreover, a permanent governor of the central bank needs to be appointed on an immediate basis to ensure stability in the currency market,” he demanded. 
The delegation pointed out a SBP circular of July 5 under which a prior approval for the import of machinery (chapter 84 and 85) is required to be obtained from the SBP and only after the approval, the banks need to release import shipment documents. The process of getting the approval from the SBP takes 10 to 15 days. As a result, the members of business community are facing demurrage on the shipments.  
According to them, there is a need for establishing special economic zones (SEZs) in Lahore as the two major industrial estates (Sundar and Quaid-i-Azam) have reached their full capacity and the cost of land for the business community in the existing industrial estates has reached exorbitantly high levels.  
The delegation also discussed with the governor various other issues including non-introduction of the fixed tax regime (starting from Rs3,000 to be collected with electricity bills) for small retailers, unclear policy on tier-1 retailers integration with FBR through Point of Sale (POS) system, lack of interaction with the business community on the part of minister for finance, inflated water tariff (Rs100,000 per cusec) imposed by Wasa, high rate of conversion fee (20 per cent of DC value) for land use charged by LDA and imposition of Punjab Infrastructure Development Cess (PIDC) at the rate of 0.9pc on dry ports. 
“Since the business community is backbone of country’s economy, I promise my full support in taking up the issues with the relevant officials of the federal and Punjab governments,” pledged the governor Rehman while responding to the delegation members.

9,‘Ailurophile’ moves Lahore court against vet,Accuses a private pet clinic of killing her pet cat allegedly due to medical negligence.,"LAHORE: The district consumer court is hearing a complaint of a woman against a private pet clinic for killing her pet cat allegedly due to medical negligence.
Fatima Binte Adeeb, the complainant, also claims damages of Rs5 million; however, the pet clinic owner, Abid Hussain, denies the charge of medical negligence.
The woman took her five-and-half-year old cat called Muezza to the clinic in Gulberg on Sept 8, 2021, and got her treatment from the respondent veterinary doctor for over two weeks. She received veterinary services for the cat which opted to starve after a usual cat fight.
The complainant says the vet refused to hospitalise the cat rather advised high-dose antibiotic injections at home. She claims the vet during the weeks-long treatment of the cat ignored doing anything for the pet’s nutrition requirements and let it starve.
She says the respondent vet kept blindly advising antibiotic injections and the cat died due to liver failure. She argues that the cause of death has been confirmed in medical reports of the cat.
In his reply filed through a counsel, the respondent vet denies the charges as bogus claiming that the complainant never visited his clinic.
Interestingly, the respondent admits the visiting of the complainant to his clinic in a reply submitted to the Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council (PVMC) following a separate complaint filed by the aggrieved woman.
The vet even says the complainant used to visit his clinic along with her pet on a regular basis. He claims the clinic advised the complainant that her cat needed daily antibiotics, painkillers and fluid therapy, however, she expressed her inability to bring the cat for a daily check-up citing professional duties.
The respondent alleges that the cat lost life due to the negligence of the complainant and she has been trying to damage the reputation of his clinic with a mala fide intention.
In her rebuttal, the woman also denies the claim of the vet, however, the PVMC is yet to resume its next hearing.
The consumer court would resume its hearing on Sept 15.

The ground work of the Rs42 billion (estimated cost) project has been started at the junction point near Kharian on the GT Road, where machinery has already been moved and contractor firm, as well as NHA, have set up their respective on-site camps. An NHA team led by Deputy Director Ahmad Bilal HAS launched the work at the site. 
An official told Dawn that initially, possession of the acquired project land has been taken by the authority and the entire route is being cleared of bushes, trees and structures, whereas earth filling work will be done in the second phase. 
He says the original motorway design shows six lanes, but the current project is limited to only four lanes -- two lanes on its each side. The main motorway is 60km long, while a 9km-long portion of the four-lane link road (also part of the motorway) will be built to connect M-11 with the GT Road near Bismillah Chowk, Kharian, he adds. 
Moreover, he says, the project includes five interchanges and a service area, all falling in Gujrat district. Besides, a one-kilometer long bridge over the River Chenab linking Sialkot and Gujrat will also be built, the official says, adding that the contractor firm will work simultaneously on the entire route of the project as different construction groups have been engaged for the purpose. 
The official hopes the project, being executed on built-operate-transfer (BOT) basis through public-private-partnership, will be completed in its stipulated time of two years. 
He says the federal government has provided the land, costing Rs13 billion, for the project, whereas the contractor firm -- the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) will bear the cost of construction. 
At least 4,600 acres of land falling in some 64 villages of three tehsils, including 28 villages of Gujrat, 22 of Kharian and 14 of Sambrial (Sialkot district), has already been acquired by the NHA through the local administrations. 
The official says the M-11 will be expanded up to Islamabad after completion of Kharian-Sambrial section, to become the shortest route between Lahore and Islamabad. H
owever, the Kharian-Islamabad motorway project, that has already been approved, is yet to be launched. The project, he says, after its completion, will help reduce the traffic volume on the Lahore-Islamabad GT Road. But due to being a shortest route between both the big cities of Pakistan, traffic volume on M11 can increase manifold and the route is being built as 4 lanes instead of 6 lanes. 
The business fraternity of Sialkot and Gujrat have been awaiting execution of the Kharian-Sambrial motorway project, hoping it will help facilitate their businesses.  
However, they want this motorway to be expanded to six lanes, as per the original design, apprehending that it may become crowded for the expected rush of traffic because of being the shortest route between Lahore and Islamabad.  
In the initial plan, no direct access to M-11 had been provided from Gujrat city and MNA Moonis Elahi had raised the matter before the then prime minister Imran Khan at the project’s opening ceremony held at the PM House, Islamabad, last year. 
Mr Khan had agreed to the idea of including the direct link to Gujrat city, the home town of the newly-elected Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi.

The administration is yet to set up relief camps for the people.
The irrigation officials and provincial disaster management authority (PDMA) had alerted about the possibility of medium flood in Chenab and Indus rivers. Many dykes had not been completed along the Chenab sides. Already the erosion by both rivers had hit villages along Rangpur and people along Head Mohammed Wala, Sher Shah and Doaba had been evacuated. 
Water has inflicted damage on swathes of crops while the villagers and many other families alleged that the administration did not inform them about the situation.
According to Deputy Commissioner Ali Annan Qamar, in coming days the Chenab will swell and high flood is expected. “The administration is busy evacuating people from most dangerous areas and families are reluctant to leave their homes and villages.”
The DC claimed that there was no shortage of vaccine of anti-snake and anti-rabies and a “sufficient stock is available.”
The DC said relief camps would be set up after analysing the water flow.
Fazal Hussain, a resident of Chak Rohari and Fiaz Hussain of Doaba, claimed that already their crops had been submerged by water and there was a threat of increase in flow in coming days.
The irrigation officials said more than half a dozen dykes had been repaired and teams were monitoring the situation.
Officials said the Chenab had capacity of 300,000 cusec water; if the flow increased it would be high flood and then city area would be vacated. 
Sources said the staffers were alerted about the possibility of breach in three dykes.
