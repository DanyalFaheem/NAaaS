0,JCP holds back assent for CJP’s nominees to top court,"In letter to JCP members, calls for acting secretary to ""immediately release"" to media the decisions taken at the meeting.","• Nominations opposed five to four during ‘heated session’
• SC statement says decision on elevations ‘deferred’
• Justice Isa writes to members, says meeting minutes not dictated by CJP
ISLAMABAD: The Judi­cial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on Thursday opposed — by a majority of five to four — a set of four names proposed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial for elevation to the Supreme Court, but decided to consider the case of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) chief justice later.
Presided over by CJP Bandial, the meeting was called to consider for elevation to the Supreme Court the names of Chief Justice Qaiser Rasheed Khan of the PHC, Justice Shahid Waheed of the Lahore High Court (LHC) and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Naimatullah Phulpoto of the Sindh High Court (SHC).
According to a press note issued by the Supreme Court, the meeting was attended by seven members of JCP in-person while senior puisne judge, Justice Qazi Faez Isa and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Ashtar Ausaf attended via Zoom from Spain and USA, respectively.
The press note said that names of all five judges proposed were considered by the JCP and, after detailed discussion, the chairman proposed that the meeting be deferred to enable the CJP to place additional information and data about those already proposed, and if he deems it appropriate, add more names to the list of for consideration by the JCP.
The proposal to defer the meeting was supported by Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, retired Justice Sarmad Jalal Osmany and Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf.
The date of the next meeting will be decided later.
Soon after the meeting, Justice Qazi Faez Isa wrote a letter to the CJP and other members of the commission in which he recalled how he, and four other members, had rejected the names of three junior judges of the Sindh High Court and one junior judge of the Lahore High Court.
In the case of the PHC CJ, it was decided that since he was neither the most senior chief justice, nor the most senior high court judge in the country, his name could be considered if it was placed alongside the CJs of other high courts and most senior judges.
The participants concluded that the Constitution did not permit appointments to ‘anticipated’ vacancies.
Justice Isa’s letter said Chief Justice Umar Bandial did not “dictate the decisions and left the meeting quite abruptly”, followed by Justice Ijazul Ahsan. Therefore, it had now fallen to the acting secretary to draw up the minutes of the decisions taken at the JCP meeting.
This is the first time he is doing so as the secretary is on holiday.
“The eyes of the nation are transfixed on JCP and they have constitutional right to know what was decided. Therefore, the acting secretary should immediately release this decision to the media to end unnecessary speculation and misreporting as the meeting was held behind closed doors.
“It is expected that the minutes will accurately reflect all that transpired,” Justice Isa’s letter said.
An informed source said the nominations were rejected by a majority of five to four during a heated session lasting three hours in which the CJP, Justice Ijazul Ahsan, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and former judge Justice Sarmad Jalal Osmany voted in favour of the nominees whereas Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, the AGP, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and Akhtar Hussain, the Pakistan Bar Council’s (PBC) representative in the commission, voted against.
Justice Shahid Waheed is fourth on the LHC’s seniority list while Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Naimatullah Phulphoto are fourth, sixth and seventh on the SHC’s list.
The Supreme Court has 13 judges at present against a sanctioned strength of 17 while the fifth vacancy will occur when Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, a member of the JCP, retires on Aug 14.
“This is unprecedented; never in the past have all the nominations been opposed like this, although on Sept 4, 2021, the nomination of Justice Ayesha Malik was deferred after a four-four split,” observed a member of the PBC.
SCBA hails development
Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon, who heads the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), was quick to appreciate the development, saying the government had responded in a positive manner and on merit.
“I am grateful to those JCP members who rejected the nomination since they supported the joint resolution in which both PBC and SCBA had called for strict adherence to the rule of law and the principle of seniority while considering the elevation of junior judges to the Supreme Court was in violation of the seniority principle,” Mr Bhoon pleaded.
The source explained that the majority at the JCP meeting stressed that the seniority principle should be strictly followed for elevation of judges to the apex court.
All members of the commission suggested that Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah be considered for elevation to the Supreme Court.
Referring to the nomination of Justice Shahid Waheed of the Lahore High Court, the JCP rejected the case since seven judges from Punjab had already been elevated to the Supreme Court.
Referring to the SHC, the majority members argued that if Chief Justice Ahmed Ali Sheikh was not competent for elevation, he should be prosecuted by invoking Article 209 of the Constitution. Otherwise, they added, he should be elevated to the apex court as he is the most senior high court judge in the country.
Justice Sheikh had declined to be appointed as ad hoc judge of the Supreme Court after the JCP decided on Aug 10 last year to appoint him for one year provided he agreed.
The majority of JCP members were of the view that Justice Irfan Saadat Khan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi of SHC were as competent as the judges whose names have been proposed for elevation.
About the nomination of Peshawar High Court’s chief justice, the majority was of the view that consideration should be deferred since Justice Roohul Amin Khan was junior to Justice Qaiser Rasheed Khan by just one day, therefore, his name should also be considered.

1,"PML-Q strips Chaudhry Shujaat, Tariq Bashir Cheema of party roles",Central body says Shujaat’s poor health affecting affairs; Cheema ‘conspiring against PML-Q’.,"• Central body says Shujaat’s poor health affecting affairs; secretary general ‘conspiring against PML-Q’
• Party spokesperson says Kamil Ali Agha not empowered to call CWC meeting
LAHORE: Just days after Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain as the party chief wrote a letter to PML-Q lawmakers in Punjab not to vote for his cousin, Parvez Elahi, in the recent chief minister’s election, the PML-Q central working committee on Thursday unanimously decided to remove Shujaat and federal minister Tariq Bashir Cheema from their party positions.
The committee claimed the PML-Q chief was unable to take ‘prudent’ party decisions owing to his ill health and the latter was conspiring against and using the party for his personal interests.
The PML-Q committee meeting held under the chairmanship of Senator Kamil Ali Agha decided to hold fresh elections for top party positions within 10 days. It constituted a five-member election commission and appointed the party lawyers’ wing acting president, Jahangir A Jhoja, as the election commissioner. Mr Jhoja will also oversee the party’s organisational and administrative matters until the intra-party polls.
Referring to Chaudhry Shujaat’s letter directing the party MPAs to vote for PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz, Senator Agha told the media after the meeting that all limits had been crossed to damage the party. “Is there any justification left to keep Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain as the party president and Tariq Bashir Cheema as secretary general?” he asked. “If the letter episode can happen, this can happen too.”
The senator further said the party central working committee meeting had been called after two-thirds of its members expressed their concerns that Shujaat’s poor health was affecting the party.
When contacted, Senator Agha told Dawn the CWC was the party’s high-powered committee that delegated its powers to the president, secretary general and other office-bearers, therefore it was empowered to remove any official with a majority vote. Mr Hussain was elected as party president for a four-year term in the intra-party polls held in February last year.
Stressing that there was no need to issue show-cause notices to both senior office-bearers, he said the requisition to call the CWC meeting in an emergency was made by 42 of its members though the body’s minimum quorum was 40 members. He further said 83 out of the total 150 members attended the meeting and passed all the resolutions, including about the removal of party president Shujaat and secretary general Cheema.
“The committee members had earlier asked the secretary general to call the CWC meeting and upon his refusal, I was asked to call it for being a senior member of the party,” Mr Agha explained.
Mr Tariq Bashir Cheema neither replied to Whatsapp messages nor responded to calls.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by a party spokesman from Islamabad claimed no decision was taken to call the party’s CWC meeting. “Senator Agha is the party’s Punjab chapter general secretary and therefore not empowered to take any decision against the party president,” the spokesman stated.
Citing the PML-Q constitution, the spokesman said no party meeting could be called without the consultation and will of the party president. “Neither any party office-bearer nor a member was informed, nor a notice issued to call the meeting,” the spokesman claimed and advised that rumours should be avoided.
During the presser, Senator Agha said the committee also passed a resolution that all PML-Q MPAs would vote for Muhammad Sibtain Khan, the PTI candidate for Punjab Assembly speaker, on Friday (today). It passed another resolution lauding the services rendered by Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as speaker of the provincial legislature and hoped he would continue his good work for the welfare of people as the chief minister.
On the other hand, he condemned the removal of Chaudhry Shujaat’s pictures from the party secretariat and maintained no one could justify the action.

2,Imran brainstorms with Elahis,Discusses the implementation and extension of public welfare projects in Punjab.,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Parvez Elahi and his son Moonis Elahi, a former federal minister, on Thursday held a video-link meeting with PTI chairman Imran Khan and discussed the implementation and extension of public welfare projects in the province.
Mr Khan said the PML-N government in its short stint in Punjab ignored PTI government’s public welfare programmes such as Ehsaas Programme and Sehat Insaf Card. Mr Elahi asserted that the PTI government’s welfare programmes would be promoted at a fast pace.
The meeting also discussed political and administrative matters in the province as well as the strategy to resolve problems being faced by the masses. Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Muhammad Khan Bhatti was also present.
Mr Elahi said the people of Punjab were standing by PTI chairman Imran Khan and their candidates’ win in the by-election was the victory of Mr Khan’s narrative.
Meanwhile, the PTI chief also asked the Punjab government to immediately provide assistance to people in the flood-hit areas of South Punjab and Mianwali district. “I have also asked the KP govt to immediately provide flood relief to the people in affected areas of Balochistan,” he stated in a tweet.

3,NA speaker approves resignations of 11 PTI MNAs,"ISLAMABAD: Amid gro­wing acrimony between the PTI and the PML-N, Natio­nal Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf on...","ISLAMABAD: Amid gro­wing acrimony between the PTI and the PML-N, Natio­nal Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf on Thursday accepted the resignations of 11 PTI lawmakers who had resigned after the vote of no confidence against former PM Imran Khan.
According to the NA Secretariat, the resignations of Dr Shireen Mazari, Far­rukh Habib, Ali Muhammad Khan, Fazal Muhammad Khan, Shaukat Ali, Fakhar Zaman Khan, Ijaz Ahmed Shah, Jamil Ahmed Khan, Muhammad Akram Cheema, Abdul Shakoor Shad and Shandana Gulzar Khan have been accepted.
Out of these members, Ms Gulzar and Ms Mazari were elected on the reserved seats.
After the ouster of former prime minister Imran Khan through a successful no-confidence motion in the NA on April 10, 131 PTI members and Awami Muslim Lea­gue’s (AML) Sheikh Rashid had submitted their resignations.
The NA secretariat had sent notices to these lawmakers on May 30, asking them to appear in person before the speaker to confirm their resignations, however none of them appeared.
The speaker was expected to accept more resignations in the coming days.
Earlier, sources in the NA secretariat had said that a majority of the resignations submitted by the PTI MNAs were not handwritten and had similar text printed on the party’s letterhead.
The source added that the secretariat staff also had doubts over the signatures of some members as they didn’t match with those on the assembly’s roll.
Most of these MNAs had submitted their resignations on April 11 when Shehbaz Sharif was elected prime minister. Some of them, including former NA deputy speaker Qasim Khan Suri and Sheikh Rashid had submitted their resignations on a later date.
After forming the government in Punjab, on the back of the Supreme Court’s verdict declaring Parvez Elahi as the chief minister, it was expected that Mr Khan would review his decision to resigned from the NA, as assembly business has been badly affected for the last few months. Many standing committees were without a head after the resignation of PTI lawmakers.
However, on Wednesday the PTI chairman categorically ruled out the possibility of any negotiation with the ruling coalition and reiterated his demanded for early elections.

PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman addresses a press conference along with PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz Sharif and other leaders on Thursday.—Online

 
ISLAMABAD: Reiterating the ruling coalition’s stance that it would complete its constitutional term, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) strongly rejected the Supreme Court verdict in the case of the Punjab chief minister’s election and, once again asked for the interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution by a full bench of the apex court.
“The government will complete its term and the next general elections will be held on time,” PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said at a joint press conference with Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz, after a meeting of the alliance, held on Thursday.
He said two resolutions were adopted unanimously by the forum, including the one which said that a presidential reference should be sent to the Supreme Court seeking interpretation of Article 63-A through a full court bench.
Article 63-A is related to the disqualification of member (of national and provincial assemblies) on defection ground.
The meeting, he said, emphasised that under the Constitution, no institution could interfere in the domain of other institutions.
Fazlur Rehman, who is also chief of his own faction of the JUI, said the PDM will also hold threadbare discussions on the issue where other political parties not part of PDM will also be invited.
In the second resolution, he said, the alliance had demanded that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) immediately announce its verdict in the prohibited funding case against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).
“We will stage sit-in in front of the ECP office if a decision is not announced,” Fazlur Rehman said.
Lashing out at Imran Khan, he termed the PTI chief “the biggest criminal in the country” adding that the government would have to lay its hands on him. The PDM chief rejected Imran Khan’s claim that he was toppled through a conspiracy hatched by the United States. “America brought you (to power) but did not remove you,” he said.
PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz also launched a verbal attack on the three-member bench of the Supreme Court, saying that their verdict was simply meant to benefit the ladla (blue-eyed one) – a term she had repeatedly used to describe the PTI chief.
She said that if a full bench of the apex court would have been formed on the demand of the government, it would have become difficult for the bench to give such a verdict. “Justice murdered in the decision,” she added.
“When the verdict came, I thought to myself ‘what you have done, chief justice?’. No one can insult the court from outside but this happened from within,” she said, adding that legislation was not the responsibility of the judiciary.
“If it is so, then lock up the parliament,” Maryam said.
She asked how three members, who always remained part of benches that gave decisions against PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, could give a verdict against the Constitution. “We will not accept this decision,” she insisted.
