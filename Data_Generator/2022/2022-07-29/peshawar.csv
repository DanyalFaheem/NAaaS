Addressing the protesters, the speakers lamented that they were forcibly displaced and were forced to live a refugee life in their own country. They said they were displaced from their native areas when the government launched a military operation against terrorists in North Waziristan in 2014. 
The protestors said the government had provided them SIMs through which they used to receive Rs20,000 cash assistance per family, but later the SIMs were blocked which had created problems for their families living away from their native areas. 
“We have been requesting the authorities to resolve the issue, but they have adopted mysterious silence,” said an elder, vowing to continue the protest till acceptance of their demands. 
They also demanded effective measures for repatriation of TDPs from Afghanistan. 
Later in the day, Awami National Party provincial general secretary Sardar Hussain Babak and other leaders visited the protest camp and expressed solidarity with the displaced people. 
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Babak said the repatriation and rehabilitation of displaced persons was a collective problem of Pakhtuns, while the government had adopted a harsh attitude with them. 
He said thousands of tribal elders, women and children had died during the militancy and they wanted repatriation and rehabilitation of their families. 
Mr Babak said Pakhtuns were branded as traitors when they raised voice for their rights. He said the actual traitors were those elements who were denying rights to the tribal people.

Provincial Inspector General of Police Moazzam Jah Ansari told reporters at the Central Police Office here on Thursday that the 20-year-old embroiderer had confessed to sexual assaults and murders.
Declaring the accused a serial killer, he said the resident of Sufaid Dheri area had committed the crime on Sundays in the cantonment area.

4,High court rejects petition seeking orders to block deal between govt and TTP,"Plea was filed by parents of students, teacher killed in 2014 APS attack.","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday rejected a petition seeking its orders to stop the federal government from making a deal with the banned terrorist outfit Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan without the consultation of parents of those killed in the 2014 Peshawar Army Public School attack.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Shahid Khan pronounced a short order after the completion of arguments by both sides.
The petition was filed by mothers of four students and a woman teacher assassinated by the TTP militants in the APS attack on Dec 16, 2014.
The petitioners included Falak Naz, mother of students Noorullah and Saifullah, Shahana, mother of Asfand Khan, Seema, mother of Aimal Khan, and Zulaikha, mother of teacher Sadia Gul.

Plea was filed by parents of students, teacher killed in 2014 APS attack

Advocate Ajoon Khan, whose son Asfand Khan was also killed in the massacre, appeared for the petitioners and said parents of the slain students and teachers were the victims of the most barbaric act of terrorism in the country’s history but they had still not been taken into confidence about the ongoing negotiations of the government with the proscribed TTP.
He requested the court to issue directives to the government not to take any step of reconciliation with the T TP without taking him and the petitioners on board.
Additional attorney general Amir Javed and a representative of the ministry of defence, Colonel Rizwan, appeared for the government and opposed the petition.
The defence ministry’s representative said hundreds of thousands of people had sacrificed their lives for the country, but the compensation package given to the families of the martyrs of APS was unmatched.
He said while families of a civilian martyred by terrorists was provided with Rs2 million compensation, Rs4 million was given away to those of APS attack victims each.
The official said the families of APS Shuhada were also given a plot each measuring 10 marlas in DHA, were sent for performing Umrah apart from other facilities including free medical treatment.
He said his clients’ other children were given admissions to cadet colleges and educational institutions of  their choice for which the expenses were met by the government.
The official also said Rs90 million was spent on treatment of the students, who were injured in the attack, and that money was provided by the Pakistan Army.
He said all those involved in the APS attack were convicted and sentenced to death.
The official claimed that parents of the martyred students had confidence in the Pakistan Army and that was evident from the fact that they had been giving applications for admitting their children in Pakistan Army’s educational institutions.
Ajoon Khan took exception to the statement of the official and said he was ready to return plots and compensation as he like petitioners only wanted justice.
“We didn’t demand any compensation and instead, it was provided to us without demand. We had sent our children to school and not a war front,” he said.
The lawyer said his clients paid monthly fee to the tune of Rs5,000 to the educational institutions, whereas the children of military personnel paid Rs200 each.
He said the educational institutions of the Pakistan Army were run on the monthly fees of the civilians.
The lawyer said a threat alert was provided to the relevant security head in Aug 2014 about terrorists planning to attack APS but later it was said no such alert was issued.
He claimed that the families of the children and wives of military officials killed in the occurrence were provided compensation of Rs9.9 million, whereas the civilians were provided with Rs2 million.
The lawyer said his clients’ children should not be compared with other martyrs of terrorism as those children were target-killed.
“I have been practicing law for 20 years and if I can’t get justice for the blood of my child, how I will defend children of other people,” he said.
The counsel also said during previous hearing, it was claimed that no parleys between the government and TTP were in progress but currently, a delegation of clerics was busy holding talks with TTP leaders in Afghanistan.
AAG Amir Javed wondered what would happen if in future any other person approach the court stating that his or her relative was killed on the border while performing duty and they should also be included in the negotiations.

“The revival of civilisation for peace and welfare can really happen when the moral spirit of mankind returns to this sacred land once again. Now, all of us, who wish for a peaceful existence, make a mindful determination and send it through the sound of the bell of peace to everyone everywhere in the world,” he said.

Besides party workers, social activists and traders also attended the demonstration held in Pashat Bazaar of Salarzai tehsil. 
The protesters were holding placards inscribed with slogans against delay in launching construction work of the college building by the concerned authorities. 
They claimed that the establishment of government degree college in Salarzai was approved about seven years ago, but work on the project could not be started as yet. 
ANP district president Gul Afzal Khan, deputy general secretary Sadiq Akbar Jan, Salarzai tehsil president Bahadar Khan and others spoke on the occasion. 
They recalled that then governor Sardar Mahtab Khan during his visit to Bajaur in Dec 2014 had approved two degree colleges in the region – one for Salarzai and the other for Barang tehsil – to promote higher education in these backward areas. 
They said that construction work on government degree college in Barang tehsil was finally launched on Dec 2018 after a deal on its site was made among the district administration’s officials, PTI MNA Gul Dad Khan and local elders. 
However, they resented that work on the degree college in Salarzai could not be commenced despite passage of more than seven years. 
The speakers claimed that besides allocation of land, funds had also been approved for the college several years ago. They said hundreds of students of Salarzai tehsil were quitting education after passing grade 10th exams every year, as they could not afford education in far away areas. 
The protesters flayed the provincial government and PTI’s local lawmakers for the prolonged delay in setting up the degree college in Salarzai tehsil.

12,Coronavirus cases continue to surge as 81 more test positive,Health dept expresses concern over people’s failure to follow SOPs...,"PESHAWAR: The health department showed concern over non-adherence to the Covid-19 precautions as numbers of virus-hit people continued to rise in the province as 81 more cases were recorded on Thursday.
Officials at the department said that most of the infected persons suffered from other diseases including diabetes and issues of liver, heart and lungs due to which they stood exposed to the virus. Such patients were required to stay home, get fully vaccinated and observe precautionary measures for protection against the infection and avoid hospitalization, they added.
“Rising trend in cases is source of concern which can be overcome through strict adherence to precautionary measures. Admissions are low and most of the cases are of omicron variant, which is more contagious but has less complications and patients recover with home treatment and home quarantine,” said officials.
They said the elderly people and those with comorbidities were admitted to hospitals due to low immunity. They said that such people required inoculation and adherence to standard operating procedures. They added that a day before, the province detected 116 confirmed patients after March 13 when 110 cases were recorded.

Health dept expresses concern over people’s failure to follow SOPs

Currently, 17 patients have been admitted to hospitals due to Covid-19 with none of them on ventilator.
“With increase in tests, tally of positive cases rises. It shows that the outbreak is in progress and we need to observe standard operation procedures (SOPs) such as social distancing measures, wearing face masks and hand hygiene, especially at crowded places,” said officials.
They said that at present, the positivity level was 2.53 per cent but it could be more if 7,000 tests were conducted on daily basis as opposed to 2,000 tests carried out currently. They added that positivity was 3.8 per cent the other day in the province.
The number of Covid-19 active cases continues to surge as a week before the province was home to 458 patients but now the number has risen to 750. Most of the active cases have been detected in Peshawar, Mardan, Malakand, Mansehra, Chitral Lower, Swabi, Nowshera, Kohat and Chitral Upper.
“We want the district administrations to enforce Covid-19 precautions, especially at bus stands, wedding halls and tourist spots,” said officials. They said that a month-long vaccination campaign was under way in the province to scale up immunisation level from 61 per cent to 80 per cent to create herd immunity against the virus.
They said that positivity was 4.6 per cent at sentinel sites, three per cent among health workers including polio and dengue staffers, 1.3 per cent in public and private offices, 1.1 per cent in educational institutions, 0.4 per cent in public transport and 0.2 per cent at markets.
The department has been asking the district health officers to increase contact tracing from the present 3.4 per cent to 15 per cent to ascertain the exact situation regarding prevalence of coronavirus and take steps accordingly.
Officials said that the province had 44 hospitals with Covid-19 management wards and isolation facilitates where 2,793 beds were dedicated to the coronavirus patients with a total of 314 ventilators. They said that bed occupancy was less than one per cent while all ventilators were unutilised.
“However, in case of showing laxity towards precautions and avoidance of vaccination, we can witness the 2020 like situation when hundreds of patients were hospitalised and many died for want of beds,” they said.
They said that precautions and revaccination should be given importance. “All elderly people and those having other ailments should get jabs and observe SOPs,” they added.

Waheed Ahmad Chaudhry said that as per law the decision with respect to juvenile offender should be made within six months. However, he said that the law was not implemented in letter and spirit.
He expressed concerns over non-existence of juvenile justice committee in the provinces.
Former judge Naveed Khan said that besides juveniles, the authorities should look into the pathetic condition of shelter homes and prisons that lacked basic facilities. He said that juveniles were kept with general prisoners having different criminal background.
“When a case is not decided within six months, the juvenile court should seek extension from the high court. If no such extension has been sought by the juvenile court, the complainant or the juvenile can move high court in this respect,” he said.
The former judge also showed concerns over implementation of law. He also stressed the need for creating awareness about juvenile law among people.
Later, Sanjog chief Hafiza Tayyaba Javed distributed certificates among the participants and awarded souvenirs to speakers.
