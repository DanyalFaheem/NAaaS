0,US heatwave soars as California wildfire rages,The country’s central and northeast regions face the brunt of the extreme temperatures.,"WASHINGTON: Tens of millions of Americans already baking in a scorching heatwave braced on Saturday for record-setting temperatures to climb, while a major fire ravaged part of California.
The country’s central and northeast regions face the brunt of the extreme temperatures, which are not expected to peak until Sunday at the earliest and have sent public health officials scrambling.
More than a dozen states are under a heat advisory, with central US metropolitan areas such as Dallas and Oklahoma City expected to reach highs of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (above 38 degrees Celsius) for at least the next five days.
A heat emergency is meanwhile in effect for cities up and down the northeast coast, from Boston to Philadelphia to Washington.
Not even the usually cool Pacific Northwest will escape the far-reaching heat, with the region expected to face several days in the 90s next week.
The high temperatures, which demonstrate the threat of global warming, have already caused an uptick in emergency calls for heat-related illness.
Cities have meanwhile been forced to open cooling stations and increase outreach to at-risk communities such as the homeless and those without access to air conditioning.
“This is really one of the things that we recognize in Oklahoma — heat is the number one weather-related killer across the United States. It far surpasses any other” nature-related cause of death, Joseph Kralicek, director of the Tulsa Area Emergency Management Agency, told CNN.
Residents of the central US city were expecting temperatures to reach 103 degrees Fahrenheit Sat­urday and up to 106 degrees on Sunday and Monday.
The nation’s capital was predicted to reach temperatures at or near 100 degrees Fahrenheit Saturday, with New York not far behind.
“Look for daytime max temps to eclipse the century mark in the Central Plains and record breaking high temps from the Central Plains to the Northeast today,” the National Weather Service said in a forecast. “Sunday grows even hotter in the northeast,” it said.

1,Brexit blamed as UK faces Channel port logjam,"""The French authorities have not put enough people on the border,"" UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says.","LONDON: Unions, port officials and the French authorities blamed Brexit on Saturday as thousands of holidaymakers faced long delays trying to reach Europe via the English Channel port of Dover.
UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss laid the blame squarely on Paris, insisting:  “The French authorities have not put enough people on the border.” But officials on the other side of the Channel rejected claims that the gridlock was caused by under-staffing.
Border checks and extra paperwork for freight traffic were reintroduced when Britain left the European Union last year, ending free movement for people and goods in the bloc.
Bottlenecks of lorries at Dover have been seen since then but this summer is the first with unrestricted travel for the public since the lifting of all Covid restrictions.
French lawmaker Pierre-Henri Dumont, whose constituency includes the French Channel port of Calais, called the travel chaos  “an aftermath of Brexit”. “We have to run more checks than before,” he told BBC television, predicting it would happen again.
Port of Dover chief executive Doug Bannister initially blamed a lack of French border agency staff for the logjam which saw some holidaymakers wait six hours or longer to catch their ferries. But he conceded there were now  “increased transaction times” post-Brexit. The port was confident of handling the demand at peak periods, he added.
Brexit figurehead Boris Johnson made  “taking back control” of UK borders a rallying call for his  “leave” campaign in the 2016 vote on EU membership.
Since becoming prime minister, he has found that more difficult, with record numbers of migrants crossing from northern France in small boats.
The leader of Kent County Council, Roger Gough, estimated that 3,000 lorries were waiting to get to the port on Saturday morning. Kent Police said motorists should still expect  “significant delays”.
Lucy Moreton, from the ISU union that represents borders, immigration and customs staff, said the tailbacks were a  “reasonably predictable” result of Brexit. “This is the time that it’s chosen to bite,” she told the BBC.
Passengers have to go through both UK and French border checks at Dover before boarding ferries to northern France.
By 12:45pm, the Port of Dover said more than 17,000 passengers had already gone through. Bannister said some 8,500 vehicles had left the port on Friday, with about 10,000 expected on Saturday.
Queues for the port snaked through Dover and surrounding roads, stretching kilometres (miles), with lorries backed up the M20 motorway leading to the town.
A traffic management system was rolled out on the M20 to manage the high volume of lorries backed up towards Dover. That included closing parts of the motorway to non-freight traffic and diverting cars towards the port and the Eurotunnel by other routes.
Eurotunnel said its train shuttle services for vehicles between nearby Folkestone and Coquelles in northern France were two hours behind schedule. The prefect of the Hauts-de-France region Georges-Francois Leclerc said France had  “done its job” by increasing its border staff in Dover from 120 to 200.
He blamed the traffic jams on an accident on the M20 on Friday for the late arrival of French border agency staff at their posts in Dover. But he suggested the port itself had not done enough to handle the increased traffic, which typically jumps from 5,000 to 10,000 vehicles daily during the busy summer.

2,"‘I am the underdog,’ says British PM candidate Sunak",Sunak would be the country’s first leader of Indian origin.,"GRANTHAM: Former British finance minister Rishi Sunak on Saturday described himself as the underdog in the contest to become Britain’s next prime minister.
Sunak’s resignation helped trigger a revolt that saw Prime Minister Boris Johnson agree to step down after a series of scandals. Members of the ruling Conservative Party will vote for a successor over the summer, with an announcement due on Sept 5.
Sunak led all rounds of the voting among party lawmakers to reduce the field to two candidates. But it is foreign secretary Liz Truss who seems to have gained the advantage so far among the 200,000 members of the governing party who will ultimately choose the winner.
Truss held a 24-point lead over Sunak in a YouGov poll of Conservative Party members published on Thursday.
“Be in no doubt, I am the underdog,” Sunak said in a speech in the central England town of Grantham, the birthplace of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.
“The forces that be want this to be a coronation for the other candidate, but I think members want a choice and they are prepared to listen.” 
Truss would be only Britain’s third female prime minister after Thatcher and Theresa May, while Sunak would be the country’s first leader of Indian origin.
So far the campaigning focus has been on pledges, or non-pledges, to cut taxes at a time when many people are struggling, as well as defence spending and energy policy.
In his speech, Sunak laid out what he called  “common sense Thatcherism,” promising careful management of the economy before tax cuts.
He questioned the morality of immediate tax cuts, proposed by Truss, at a time of soaring inflation and criticised as arbitrary her pledge to increase defence spending to 3pc of GDP by 2030. Truss says tax cuts are needed to stimulate growth.
“It is wrong to take money from people that we don’t need to take when people across the country are struggling with the cost of living crisis,” she told reporters in Kent, south east England, after meeting party members.
In an interview for Saturday’s Times newspaper, Sunak said he would put the government on a crisis footing on taking office.
Truss has also promised to scrap all remaining European Union laws that still apply in Britain by 2023.

3,Shinzo Abe murder suspect to undergo mental examination,Tetsuya Yamagami reportedly targeted Abe because he believed the former leader was linked to the Unification Church.,"TOKYO: The man accused of assassinating Japan’s former prime minister Shinzo Abe is set to undergo an examination of his mental condition around the time of the incident, local media reported on Saturday.
Abe was gunned down on the campaign trail on July 8 in the western city of Nara, two days before the country’s upper house elections.
His accused killer Tetsuya Yamagami is in custody and reportedly targeted Abe because he believed the former leader was linked to the Unification Church.
On Friday, the Nara District Court approved a request by the local public prosecutors office for a psychiatric examination of 41-year-old Yamagami, the Asahi Shimbun and other local media reported, citing unnamed investigative sources. The examination is expected to wrap up in late November, the reports said.
Investigative questioning of the suspect will be halted during the mental examination.

4,"Trump, Pence hold duelling rallies as rivalry intensifies",Trump has savaged his former vice president for what he describes as a failure to block certification of 2020 election results.,"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump and his ex-wingman Mike Pence, who went from White House partners to bitter rivals, held dueling rallies on Friday in Arizona, where an upcoming Republican primary election offers an early test of their potential 2024 showdown.
The convergence of campaign events came a day after a congressional hearing on the US Capitol assault, in which a White House security official said members of Pence’s Secret Service detail feared they would die as rioters stormed the building.
Trump, who like Pence is considering running for president in 2024, has savaged his former vice president for what he describes as a failure to block the certification of the 2020 election results and send the process back to the US states.
Such a plan had been cooked up by Trump aides who supported his discredited theory that the election was stolen, but Pence ultimately decided that the action would be illegal.
During the January 6, 2021 insurrection, Trump tweeted an attack on Pence, saying he  “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country.” Administration officials testified at Thursday’s hearing that the social media post poured fuel on the fire and turned rioters against the vice president.
In extraordinary revelations at the hearing, a White House national security official who testified under anonymity said  “members of the VP detail at this time were starting to fear for their own lives.” Trump’s gathering in the central Arizona town of Prescott Valley was part of a series of  “Save America” rallies he has held to boost his favored candidates ahead of Republican primary elections.
Earlier in July, he held an event in Alaska to support Kelly Tshibaka, a challenger to the state’s incumbent senator, Lisa Murkowski, who was one of the few Republicans to vote to impeach Trump after the January 6, 2021 insurrection.
‘Yesterday’s grievances’
In Arizona, a state he narrowly lost in 2020, Trump campaigned for Kari Lake, a far-right gubernatorial candidate who supports his false claim that the election was stolen.
Lake, a former TV news host, took the stage in the crowded stadium first, declaring that in Arizona,  “We will no longer accept corruptness, and I know for a fact we will no longer accept rigged elections.” The former president, leaving the crowd to wait more than two hours, began his speech by focusing on immigration — a major campaign topic in the state which shares a large border with Mexico. But it did not take long before he turned his attention to the 2020 election.

5,China’s home-grown C919 jet ready for commercial operations,"The launch customer is the state-owned China Eastern Airlines, which has placed an order for five C919 jets in March last year.","SHANGHAI: China’s homegrown C919 narrow-body jet, designed to challenge the Airbus-Boeing duopoly, is nearing certification as its test planes completed all of the test flight tasks, the company said on Saturday.
The state-owned manufacturer Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC) said on its official social media account that the six test planes have finished the testing tasks as the programme enters the final stage of receiving a certificate from the Civil Aviation Administration of China which is required for commercial operations.
That would mark a milestone in China’s ambitions to climb up the manufacturing supply chain. China’s COMAC is now effectively the third option in the market for planes with more than 100 seats, after Boeing and Airbus struck deals to take over production of rival planes made by Embraer and Bombardier.
Designed to compete directly with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus 320neo families, the C919 aircraft programme has faced a range of technical issues and tougher US export controls, after being launched in 2008.
The launch customer is the state-owned China Eastern Airlines, which has placed an order for five C919 jets in March last year. 
Changjiang Daily, a newspaper owned by the local government of Wuhan, said in a report on July 8 the airline is scheduled to take the first delivery in August. Assembled in China, the plane relies heavily on Western components, including engines and avionics.

6,More than 20 killed in south Iran floods,TEHRAN: Flooding in southern Iran has killed at least 22 people and left others missing following heavy rainfall in...,"TEHRAN: Flooding in southern Iran has killed at least 22 people and left others missing following heavy rainfall in the largely arid country, state media reported on Saturday.
Iran has endured repeated droughts over the past decade, but also regular floods, a phenomenon made worse when torrential rain falls on sun-baked earth.
Videos posted on local and social media showed vehicles being carried away by the rising waters of the Roodball river in the southern province of Fars.
One video showed adults pulling a child from a car as it began to shift downstream.
“Twenty-one people were killed and two are still missing,” in the floods that affected several towns in and around Estahban county, Hossein Darvishi, provincial head of the Red Crescent Society, was quoted as saying by state TV.
IRNA quoted Estahban Governor Yousef Kargar as saying “around 5pm yesterday, heavy rains ... in the central parts of Estahban County led to flooding”.
The incident was reported from around 174 kilometres (108 miles) east of the provincial capital Shiraz on a summer weekend in Iran when families tend to head to cooler areas such as rivers, lakes and valleys.
“A number of local people and sightseers (from other areas) who had gone to the riverside and were present in the river bed were caught in the flood due to the rise in the water level,” Kargar added.
Iran’s First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber called on the governor of Fars province to open an investigation into the incident and “to compensate the families of the victims”.
In January, two people were initially reported killed in flash flooding in Fars when heavy rains hit the area, but the toll rose to at least eight there and elsewhere in Iran’s south. 
Like other nearby countries, Iran has suffered chronic dry spells and heat waves for years, and these are expected to worsen. Scientists say climate change amplifies extreme weather, including droughts as well as the potential for the increased intensity of rainstorms.
Meanwhile, China’s Xinjiang province on Saturday warned of more flash floods and mudslides and risks to agriculture, as heatwaves swept across the region, accelerating the pace of glacial melt and posing hazards for its cotton production.
China has been baked by above-normal summer heat since June, with some meteorologists blaming climate change. The excessively hot weather has driven up demand for electricity to cool homes, offices and factories. In agricultural regions, drought has been a concern.
