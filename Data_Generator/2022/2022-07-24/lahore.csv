1,Chances of new political alignments in Gujrat,Analysts say the Shujaat camp may find support from old foes in Gujrat.,"GUJRAT: Political crisis over the Punjab chief minister election has created chances for new political alignments in the local politics following a clear split in the ranks of PML-Q leadership.
Since the Parvez Elahi camp has been holding sway in party affairs in Gujrat for the last one decade, none of the local party officials spoke in favour of PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain regarding his letter supporting the candidature of PML-N’s Hamza Shehbaz instead of his cousin Parvez Elahi, party’s Punjab president.
However, Chaudhry Shujaat and scions may find some new allies from the camps of their family’s traditional rivals in Gujrat as some leaders of the PML-N and PPP belonging to Nawabzada, Kaira and Pagganwala families have commended Shujaat Hussain’s support for Hamza.
On the other hand, PTI and PML-Q workers staged demonstrations against the decision of party chief as well as deputy speaker’s ruling of cancelling PML-Q votes.
Some Q workers also lodged protest in front of the Zahoor Elahi house, the Gujrat residence of Chaudhrys, and chanted slogans against party chief and his son Salik Hussain, a member the federal cabinet.
Though Shujaat Hussain did not contest any election from his native constituency in Gujrat city NA-69 after being defeated by PPP’s Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar (late) in 2008, his elder son Shafay Hussain has been lobbying to contest from the city in the next general elections whereas Salik Hussain had won by-election from an NA seat of Chakwal after Parvez Elahi vacated both NA seats he had won from Gujrat and Chakwal districts to retain his Punjab Assembly seat from (Kunjah) Gujrat.
Parvez Elahi contested last two elections from NA-69 which is now being held by his son Moonis Elahi.  
Mainly, NA-69 is the constituency where late Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi and then his son Shujaat Hussain had contested the elections since 1970 and now Parvez Elahi and Moonis Elahi have been leading the family’s politics here.
Interestingly, the Pagganwalas and Servis group of former federal minister Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar and Chaudhry Ahmed Saeed had been the main political rivals of the Chaudhrys in that constituency until 2013.
However, the death of former MNA Mian Mushtaq Hussain Pagganwala who defeated Zahoor Elahi and then the demise of Ahmed Mukhtar and Ahmed Saeed had weakened the rival camps of Chaudhrys.
Analysts say that Shujaat camp may find support from old foes in Gujrat in case of Salik and Shafay’s doing electrical politics from the native town whereas the Parvez camp already enjoys the support of most of the Q figures and the PTI.
Some see strong chances of a cousin versus cousin competition in the future elections of Gujrat.
Adviser to Prime Minister Qamar Zaman Kaira, ex-MNA Sameena Pagganwala of the PPP and PML-N’s district president Tahirul Mulk, Gujrat Municipal Corporation former mayor Haji Nasir Mahmood and ex-MPA from city Haji Imran Zafar of the PML-N and several other officials welcomed the decision of the PML-Q chief terming it a wise step to save the country from a crisis.
They all were unanimous in commending Chaudhry Shujaat, highlighting a new era of politics in Gujrat.

7,"Parliament is supreme, no force should dictate it: Saad","Warns PTI chief Imran Khan to stop abusing, hurling threats at politicians.","LAHORE: The PML-N demands that a larger or full bench should hear the plea in the Punjab chief minister case.
Railways  minister Khwaja Saad Rafique said on Saturday the political coalition  had demanded that a  full bench should hear the Supreme Court Bar  Association’s review petition for the  interpretation of Article 63-A.  He said the article had  been wrongly interpreted so far.
“One-sided  decision will not lead the country to economic stability and election,”  he said while addressing the demonstrators at Liberty roundabout.
Rafique warned PTI chairman Imran Khan should stop abusing and hurling threats at politicians, judiciary, election commission and army otherwise, he   (Imran) would keep running from pillar to post. “Parliament is supreme and no force should drag or dictate it,” he asserted.
Earlier, Punjab Home Minister Attaullah Tarar demanded: “The judges who heard the case of the chief minister poll last had a particular opinion and  precisely for this reason it’s necessary that either a larger or full bench should hear it now.”
Addressing a press conference here on Saturday, he said justice could not have double standards. If 25 MPAs of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) were de-seated on the basis of a reference sent by the party head against them, why not now?
“Where is the proof that these 25 members were directed to vote for Parvez  Elahi,” asked the minister. He insisted that the success of the PML-N in  election for the chief minister was in accordance with law and Constitution.  On Friday, he said, the deputy speaker read out the votes tally of the previous election for the chief minister’s office. He read out from the Assembly record that Parvez Elahi got zero votes, and at that time neither the PML-Q nor the PTI disputed that statement, as they had boycotted the elections. “These are important questions and must be answered,” he demanded.
The political parties, which had been creating constitutional crisis for the last four months, must explain why did they move court today. In case of Nawaz Sharif, it was clarified that a party head had unlimited powers. All past cases and present matters of de-seating of 25 members required a full bench, Tarar said.   PML-N leaders Ahsan Iqbal and Talal Chaudhry also held press conferences  and criticised Imran Khan for maligning the institutions.
“Imran  Khan is trying to spread anarchy and thriving on confrontation but the PML-N does not want to be part of any political showdown which will  only complicate national problems,” said Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal.
He said the PML-N and its coalition parties played a responsible role to save the economy. “It is Imran Khan who had pushed the country to the brink of economic precipice. When the coalition government took over, the exchequer was exhausted. For the first time in the country’s history, the Ministry of Finance had stopped development funding for the last quarter of last fiscal year. What else  proof one needs to see that the country was on the verge of economic collapse?”  The demand of the coalition  government about constitution of the full bench to hear the case of the  Punjab chief minister election should be taken seriously as it’s important to  avoid any dispute, said Iqbal. He said the coalition parties wanted to  protect the sanctity of courts at any cost.
Meanwhile, Talal Chaudhry criticised Imran Khan for “uttering derogatory  remarks against national institutions”. He told a press conference that   across-the-board accountability should be ensured as nobody was above   the law.
