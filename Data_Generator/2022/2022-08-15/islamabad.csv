0,PM Shehbaz asks CDA to complete Bhara Kahu bypass within four months,Inaugurates Rawal Dam Interchange’s flyover; gives one month to civic body to start inter-city bus service.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday directed the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to complete the Bhara Kahu bypass within four months and ensure that the inter-city bus service was made operational within one month.
He issued these directives while inaugurating the flyover of Rawal Dam Interchange project.
Completing the Bhara Kahu bypass within four months is completely doable, PM Sharif said, adding that in Lahore and Murree, his team completed major projects in four months.
The prime minister also announced that he would award a medal to CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed if the bypass was completed within the given time, also directing the civic body  to complete the remaining work on the Rawal Dam Interchange as soon as possible. 

Inaugurates Rawal Dam Interchange’s flyover; gives one month to civic body to start inter-city bus service

Prime Minister Sharif appreciated the civic body’s chief, his team as well as the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) for completing the flyover project in record time, adding that it was good to see the chairman having changed himself.
“Had he [chairman of CDA] changed himself earlier, Islamabad would have changed by now, but it is never too late,” the prime minister said.
It is relevant to note here that in April this year after completing around 50pc of the work, the previous contractor left the project halfway. 
The CDA then engaged the FWO to complete the remaining work. While visiting the site in April, the prime minister had directed the civic body to complete this project by September by all means.
The original deadline of this project, worth Rs1.1 billion, is October, however, on the directions of PM Sharif, officials of the civic agency remained on their toes during the last three days to complete it. 
Now, the flyover has been completed and it is expected that the remaining work will also be completed within one month. 
Earlier, while talking about bus services, Mr Sharif said the CDA chief had sought two months to start the inter-city bus service, but he was giving him one month to launch the service.
Bhara Kahu bypass
The project has been facing delay causing unrest among citizens as traffic congestion is common on Murree Road.
The 7.8km long bypass, which is part of the Margalla Road project, was designed to provide an alternative route to those travelling towards Murree, Galyat and Kashmir. 
The proposed bypass will start from Malpur area and culminate near Satra Meel on Murree Road.
Former prime minister Imran Khan had laid the foundation stone of the project in April last year near Quaid-i-Azam University, but work on this project is yet to begin.
Meanwhile, sources said the CDA had already decided to prefer a flyover project over the proposed Bhara Kahu bypass project. Sources said the engineering wing of the civic agency came up with a new proposal stating that construction of a road cum flyover would solve the problem of traffic congestion.
They said a new road would be constructed along the existing Kayani Road, which is linked with Quaid-i-Azam University Road, and it will be used as bypass road near Kayani Bridge to Jugi stop from where a flyover will be built till the end of Bhara Kahu (towards Murree Road).
CDA officials said the project could not be completed in four months as a lot of cut and fill is involved in this project, however, they added that the road project from Kayani Bridge to Jugi stop and then flyover from Jugi towards end of the bazaar is doable.
CDA will place both options before the prime minister, they said.
Commenting on the PM’s directive, former senator Enver Baig, who is a local of the area, said the bypass project should have been done before the Rawal Dam Interchange project, adding that the project was not required and there was no serious traffic hazard but just because of the “high and mighty living in Chak Shahzad and surrounding areas” the CDA carried out work on it first.
“Now, after prime minister’s directive and ultimatum , I am hopeful that the CDA will complete the Bhara Kahu bypass, which is most urgently needed within four months’ time. I have also seen ambulances stuck in traffic jam in Bhara Kahu,” he said.

3,Rights organisation urges CAA to use humane bird deterrents,"ISLAMABAD: Animal welfare organisation, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has discouraged the...","ISLAMABAD: Animal welfare organisation, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has discouraged the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority to reverse its “deadly” decision to deploy bird shooters on the runway at Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore and use humane bird deterrents instead.
A letter by the organisation was sent to director general of the authority Khaqan Murtaza regarding the recently reported plan to use lethal means in an attempt to deter birds from colliding with airplanes.
“Money spent on shooting or poisoning birds at airports is wasted on an endless killing cycle because when wild animals are killed, more will simply move in to take advantage of the available resources. Effective wildlife-management programmes are based on a simple rule: If you remove food sources and make an environment unattractive to wildlife, animals will move on. PETA, recommends banning the public from feeding wildlife, installing fencing, planting dense vegetation around nearby water sources, and implementing non-lethal scare tactics, such as sonic devices, lasers, motion detectors, scarecrows, or mylar streamers in order to prevent animals from frequenting an area,” said Shalin G Gala, vice president of International Laboratory Methods.
In response to the letter, the authority highlighted that bird shooters were deployed as a last resort, when the bird population around airfields becomes difficult to control and risk of collisions with aircraft increases.
“Clearing airfields of birds is a round the year activity. Trimming grass, clearing vegetation, use of fire crackers, acoustic systems and flashing bright lights are some of the measures already in use. There is already a plan to acquire modern sound devices to scare birds away and prevent collisions with aircraft. But bird concentration becomes a problem after Eidul Azha and especially in monsoon. Bird shooters are only deployed when danger of bird strikes is critical,” said Saifullah, who is the spokesperson for CAA.
He elaborated on the door-to-door drives and campaigns on radio and television to create awareness about keeping neighbourhoods clean and the risks of littering around airfields.
“Fortunately, nine out of 10 bird strikes in the past have been reported by pilots after safely landing,” he said.
From 2018 till May 31, 2022, about 662 incidents of bird strike were reported to the authority. Since 2018, there have been 198 bird strikes at the Lahore airport alone, Karachi followed with 192 bird strikes in the last four years, 100 bird strikes have been reported in Islamabad, 40 in Peshawar, 26 in Multan, 53 in Sialkot, 22 in Faisalabad, five in Gilgit, 17 in Quetta, four in Sukkur and one in Skardu.
So far, from January till May 31, this year, there have been 48 bird strikes. The authority is compiling reports of bird strikes in the last few months since Eid and during monsoon when bird concentration around airfields is the highest than at any other time of the year.
“No air space is free from this phenomenon. Of course, safety of passengers is paramount. Damage to aircraft can cause loss of millions of dollars, which causes flight delays. Nonetheless, the authority is in the process of inducting technology to prevent such incidents,” Saifullah said.

4,"Non-release of revised salaries, pensions perturb RMC workers",RAWALPINDI: Pensioners and government employees of the local government department on Saturday expressed their...,"RAWALPINDI: Pensioners and government employees of the local government department on Saturday expressed their displeasure over the delay in the issuance of the notification for increase in their salary and pension as promised by the Punjab government in the annual budget 2022-23.
The former provincial government, led by the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had announced an increase of 15pc in the salary of government employees and 5pc in pension. However, the local government department has still not issued the notification.
Municipal Pensioners Action Committee President Tahir Mehmood toldDawn that the government did not increase the pension as promised in the annual budget due to which the pensioners were facing a host of problems.
Mohammad Khan, a pensioner of the RMC, said many senior citizens depended on their pensions and the government was not paying any heed to this issue, adding that there was a dire need to give former employees a raise.
He said utility bills had increased while inflation had made the lives of the common man difficult, adding that their pension was not even sufficient for their medicines.
Rafiq Ahmed, a former employee, said the government had announced an increase in their pension but they had still not received the revised payment.
He further said usually the increased salary and pension were released with effect from July.
When contacted, Commissioner Noorul Amin Mengal said the government had increased the salaries of its employees and the finance department issued the notification in this regard last month.
However, he said as far as the local government was concerned, the board had to decide the increase and then issue notification.
“It is not a big issue as the notification will be issued soon and the employees and pensioners will get their arrears,” he said.

The official added that on Monday last another 14-year-old boy, identified as Raza Ansar Qureshi, had drowned in Jhelum River near the town of Badhiara.
His body has not been found despite the passage of almost one week, he said.
