0,"Man dies after crashing car, firing gun near US Capitol",A statement from the US Capitol Police did not identify the man or speculate on a motive.,"WASHINGTON: A man died early on Sunday near the US Capitol building after driving his car into a barricade and firing shots into the air before turning his gun on himself, police said.
A statement from the US Capitol Police (USCP) did not identify the man or speculate on a motive.
The incident occurred amid heightened tensions and violence-filled chatter on social media following the FBI’s surprise seizure of several boxes of classified government documents from former president Donald Trump’s Florida resort estate.
The Supreme Court, still behind security fencing after its bitterly divisive June ruling on abortion, is also nearby on Capitol Hill. The police statement said the man drove his car into a vehicle barricade at East Capitol Street and Second Street shortly after 4am.
“While the man was getting out of the car, it became engulfed in flames,” USCP said. “The man then fired several shots into the air.” When officers responded to the sound of gunfire and approached the man,  “he shot himself,” police said.
No one else was hurt.
The Congress is currently in recess, and police said  “it does not appear the man was targeting any members of Congress.” The DC Metropolitan Police Department is leading an investigation into the man and his background.
US Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger said authorities were waiting to notify the man’s next of kin.
“We do know that the subject has a criminal history over the past 10 years or so,” Manger said, according to Politico, “but nothing that at this point would link him to anything here at the Capitol.”  
USCP officer Billy Evans was killed in April 2021 after a man rammed a car into a barricade outside the Capitol and then brandished a knife, prompting officers to shoot him.

1,EU scolds Taliban after crackdown on women’s rally,Also stresses that “Afghanistan must also not pose a security threat to any country” per UN Security Council resolutions.,"BRUSSELS: The EU on Sunday said it was  “particularly concerned” about worsening conditions for women and girls in Afghanistan after the country’s ruling Taliban violently broke up a women’s rally.
Taliban fighters on Saturday fired in the air and beat up protesters taking part in a women’s  “bread, work and freedom” march in Kabul. Some women were chased into nearby shops and hit with rifle butts.
The violence underscored the Taliban’s increasing restrictions, especially on women, since they seized back control of Afghanistan a year ago, on August 15, 2021.
“The EU is particularly concerned by the fate of Afghan women and girls who have seen their freedoms, rights and access to basic services such as education being systematically denied,” the office of EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a statement.
“The EU reiterates that Afghanistan must adhere to the international treaties to which it is a State Party, including by upholding and protecting economic, social, cultural, civil and political rights, and allow for full, equal and meaningful representation and participation of all Afghans in the governing of the country.” 
It also stressed that  “Afghanistan must also not pose a security threat to any country” per UN Security Council resolutions. The Taliban have claimed having had no knowledge about the presence of Al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan, after the US announced August 2 it had killed him in Kabul with a drone strike.
The EU statement noted that the bloc’s supply of basic humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan’s people was contingent on  “a stable, peaceful and prosperous” country and the Taliban upholding human rights principles,  “in particular the rights of women and girls, children and minorities”.

Another 607 people were detected crossing the busy shipping lane between the UK and continental Europe on Saturday, taking the provisional total for 2022 to 20,017.
There were 28,526 crossings detected in the whole of 2021, and around 11,300 detected by this point last year.
The number of crossing has increased steadily each year, from 299 in 2018.
The illegal crossing are a hot political topic in the UK, with both candidates to become the new prime minister promising to clamp down.
But the government’s plans to send some of those arriving in the UK on small boats to Rwanda to claim asylum have so far been stymied by the courts.

3,Republicans fear US rivals could exploit ex-Afghan commandos,Republican lawmakers says President Joe Biden’s administration failed to prioritise evacuating them.,"WASHINGTON: Former Afghan security personnel with sensitive knowledge of US operations left behind by the American evacuation operation are vulnerable to recruitment or coercion by Russia, China and Iran, Republican lawmakers said on Sunday, noting that President Joe Biden’s administration failed to prioritise evacuating them.
“This is especially true given reports that some former Afghan military personnel have fled to Iran,” minority Republicans of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee said in a report on the first anniversary of the Taliban takeover of Kabul.
The Biden administration, the report said, failed to prioritise evacuating US-trained Afghan commandos and other elite units in the shambolic Aug 14-30, 2021, US troop pullout and evacuation operation at Kabul international airport.
Thirteen US soldiers died and hundreds of US citizens and tens of thousands of at-risk Afghans were left behind during the operation.
The administration calls the operation an  “extraordinary success” that flew more than 124,000 Americans and Afghans to safety and wound up an  “endless” war in which some 3,500 US and allied troops, and hundreds of thousands of Afghans died.
But hundreds of US-trained commandos and other former security personnel and their families remain in Afghanistan amid reports the Taliban have been killing and torturing former Afghan officials, allegations the militants deny.
Those former personnel  “could be recruited or coerced into working for one of Americas adversaries that maintains a presence in Afghanistan, including Russia, China, or Iran,” the Republican report said.
It called that possibility a  “major national security risk” because those Afghans  “know the US military and intelligence community’s tactics, techniques, and procedures.”  Some US officials and experts say Biden has sought to move on from Afghanistan without properly assessing the war’s lessons and without accountability for the chaotic evacuation.
The Republican report wedded new details of the extraction operation with congressional testimony and military and news reports to show how the administration overrode US commanders’ advice, failed to adequately plan and disregarded the Taliban’s violations of a 2020 pullout deal.
In another finding, it said the administration waited until hours before the Taliban seized Kabul to make key evacuation decisions. They included asking other countries to host transit centers for thousands of Afghan evacuees who worked for the US government during the 20-year American intervention and others at risk of Taliban retribution, said the report.

Images posted on social media showed a police officer restraining a man on the ground inside the terminal as the emergency alarm sounded in the capital’s main airport.
Police said the man was taken into custody and was being held at a station in the city. A firearm was recovered, they added. The gunman entered the airport’s departures area in the early afternoon and sat close to the terminal’s large glass windows, detective acting superintendent Dave Craft told reporters outside the building.
He added that the gunman waited five minutes before pulling out his firearm and  “let off approximately five rounds” The airport was evacuated and locked down, leading to the suspension of flights But normal operations resumed after the airport was re-opened later in the day, though some flights had been cancelled.
Craft said the crime scene indicated that the man had fired shots at the glass windows in the terminal. No shots were directed at passengers or staff, he said.
Several apparent bullet impacts were visible on the glass front on the second floor of the airport, television images showed.

5,Danger of disaster at Ukraine’s nuclear plant rising ‘every day’,"First UN-chartered vessel transporting grain to relieve the global food crisis loaded with 23,000 tonnes of wheat.","KYIV: The risk of disaster at Europe’s largest nuclear plant is  “increasing every day”, the mayor of the city where it is located said on Sunday, after Ukraine and Russia exchanged blame for fresh shelling around the facility.
The Zaporizhzhia plant in southeastern Ukraine has been occupied by Russian forces since March, and Kyiv has accused Moscow of basing hundreds of soldiers and storing arms there. The facility has come under fire repeatedly in the past week, raising the spectre of a nuclear catastrophe.
“What is happening there is outright nuclear terrorism, and it can end unpredictably at any moment,” said Dmytro Orlov, the mayor of Energodar city where the plant is based.
“The risks are increasing every day,” he said by telephone from the Ukrainian-controlled city of Zaporizhzhia. He said there was mortar shelling on the plant  “every day and night”.

First UN-chartered vessel transporting grain to relieve the  global food crisis loaded with 23,000 tonnes of wheat

“The situation is hazardous, and what causes the most concern is that there is no de-escalation process,” he added.During his televised address on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of nuclear  “blackmail” and using the plant to  “intimidate people in an extremely cynical way”.
He added Russian troops were  “hiding” behind the plant to stage bombings on the Ukrainian-controlled towns of Nikopol and Marganets. But pro-Moscow officials in the occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia blamed the shelling on Ukrainian forces.
Missiles fell  “in the areas located on the banks of the Dnipro river and in the plant”, said Vladimir Rogov, a member of the Moscow-installed administration, without reporting any casualties or damage.
A major consequence of the war has been soaring food prices after a Russian naval blockade and Kyiv’s mining of its ports prevented Ukrainian grain from being sold on global markets.
A landmark deal last month between Russia and Ukraine brokered by Turkey and the United Nations created safe corridors to allow key grain exports to resume.
And Kyiv on Sunday said the first UN-chartered vessel transporting grain from Ukraine to relieve the global food crisis was loaded with 23,000 tonnes of wheat and is ready to depart.

6,‘Avoid driving’: Dust alerts as storms return to UAE,Visibility plunges in latest adverse weather following a series of choking dust storms around the Middle East.,"DUBAI: Large parts of the United Arab Emirates were hit by dust and sandstorms on Sunday as authorities urged caution on the roads and battened down for expected heavy rain.
Homes and landmarks in major cities were caked in a fine layer of brown dirt and visibility plunged in the latest adverse weather following a series of choking dust storms around the Middle East.
On Saturday, Abu Dhabi’s official media office urged motorists to  “avoid driving unless absolutely necessary”. Visibility was below 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) in Abu Dhabi and Dubai on Sunday.
Forecasts of rainstorms this week, unusual in high summer in the desert state, follow the deaths of seven Asian migrants in flash flooding last month.
Emergency services said they had answered hundreds of calls for help as floodwaters swamped the streets of the port city of Fujairah and other eastern districts.
A series of sandstorms, widely thought to be exacerbated by climate change, have smothered Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Iran and others this year, closing airports and schools and sending thousands to hospital with breathing problems.
The UAE is highly vulnerable to global warming, according to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, as temperatures soar, rainfall dries up and storms increase, while rising sea levels threaten its low-lying coast.

Ambassador Bader Abdu­llah Al-Munaikh handed his credentials to Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian in Tehran on Saturday, Iran’s foreign ministry said on its website. Kuwait’s foreign ministry confirmed Munaikh was appointed envoy to Iran. Iran already has an ambassador in Kuwait.
The move comes as Sunni Muslim powerhouse Saudi Arabia works to improve ties with Shia Iran, with which it has been locked in a rivalry that has played out across conflicts in the region.
Riyadh broke off ties with Tehran in January 2016 after Iranian protesters stormed the Saudi embassy in Iran after Saudi Arabia executed a prominent Shia cleric.
Kuwait recalled its envoy to Iran as other Gulf Arab states downgraded ties to rally behind Riyadh. Kuwait has maintained relatively good relations with Tehran under a foreign policy balancing ties with its larger neighbours.
The United Arab Emirates is working to send an ambassador to Iran as it seeks to rebuild bridges following years of animosity, a senior Emirati official said last month.
Saudi Arabia launched direct talks with Iran last year. The kingdom’s foreign minister has said there has been some progress in five rounds of Iraq-mediated discussions, but  “not enough”.

8,Walrus that wowed Norwegian capital euthanised,Norway official says it was the only option but experts have slammed the decision.,"OSLO: A walrus nicknamed Freya that attracted crowds while basking in an Oslo fjord was euthanised on Sunday, with Norway officials saying it was the only option but experts slamming an “infinitely sad” decision.
“The decision to euthanise was taken on the basis of a global evaluation of the persistent threat to human security,” the head of Norway’s fisheries directorate said in a statement.
“We carefully examined all the possible solutions. We concluded that we could not guarantee the well-being of the animal by any of the means available,” he said.
Officials had previously said they were considering euthanasia because repeated appeals to the public to keep their distance from the young female weighing 600 kilogrammes had been in vain and that she was experiencing excessive stress.
Freya, whose name is a reference to the Norse goddess of beauty and love, had made headlines since July 17 when she was first spotted in the waters of the Norwegian capital.
Walruses normally live in the even more northerly latitudes of the Arctic.
Between long naps in the sun -- a walrus can sleep up to 20 hours a day -- Freya had been filmed chasing a duck, attacking a swan and, more often than not, dozing on boats struggling to support her bulk.
Despite repeated appeals, curious onlookers continued to approach the mammal, sometimes with children in tow, to take photographs.
‘Incredibly sad’ 
Experts said the decision to euthanise Freya did not take into account the animal’s well-being.
Siri Martinsen, a spokeswoman for animal rights group NOAH, told TV2 television that it was a rushed measure and that fines should have been issued to disperse the onlookers.
“It’s very shocking,” she added, saying it was an opportunity to show people how to respect wild animals.
“It’s infinitely sad that they chose to euthanise such a beautiful animal simply because we did not behave well with it,” biologist Rune Aae told the NTB news agency.
The Green Party earlier this week said experts recommended giving Freya sedatives and taking her away from populated areas, or taking her back to the remote Svalbard archipelago.
But the fisheries department official said that “was not a viable option” because such an operation would be too complex.
Freya, estimated to be around five years old, had already been sighted in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden and chose to spend part of the summer in Norway.

9,Three Syrian soldiers killed in Israeli air strikes,"DAMASCUS: Israeli air strikes on Syria killed three soldiers and wounded three others on Sunday, state media said,...","DAMASCUS: Israeli air strikes on Syria killed three soldiers and wounded three others on Sunday, state media said, after the latest such incident in the war-torn country.
“The aggression led to the death of three soldiers, the wounding of three others,” Syria’s official news agency said, quoting a military source.
Since civil war broke out in Syria in 2011, Israel has carried out hundreds of air strikes inside the country, targeting government positions as well as allied Iran-backed forces and Hezbollah fighters.
The latest Israeli strikes targeted sites in the countryside around the capital Damascus and south of coastal Tartus province, Sana said, adding that Syria’s air defence systems intercepted some of the missiles.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor also gave the same toll of killed and wounded from the strikes near an air defence base in Tartus province.
The targeted site in Tartus is located eight kilometres from a Russian base, said the monitor, which has a wide network of sources in Syria.
It said ambulances had rushed to the scene of the strikes in Tartus.
Early last month Syria’s defence ministry said an Israeli strike conducted from the Mediterranean Sea near the town of Al Hamadiyah, south of Tartus town, had wounded two civilians.
On Friday, Israeli shelling wounded two civilians in southern Syria near the occupied Golan Heights, according to state media.
Last month, an Israeli strike near Damascus killed three Syrian soldiers. The Observatory said that strike targeted a military facility and an “Iranian weapons depot”.
After the latest incident Israeli authorities said they “do not comment on reports in the foreign media”. 
While Israel rarely comments on individual strikes in Syria, the military has defended them as necessary to prevent Iran from gaining a foothold on its doorstep.
The conflict in Syria started with the brutal repression of peaceful protests and escalated to pull in foreign powers.
The war has killed nearly half a million people and forced around half of the country’s pre-war population from their homes.
Russia’s military intervention in 2015 helped turn the war in favour of Syria’s President Bashar al Assad, whose forces once only controlled a fifth of the country.
Last month the Observatory said a Russian air strike killed seven people, four of them children, in Syria’s rebel-held Idlib region, in the country’s north.

Just hours after Friday’s attack at a literary event, the British author had undergone emergency surgery for potentially life-threatening injuries.
But his condition, while still serious, has since shown signs of improvement and he no longer requires assisted breathing, according to his family and literary agent.
“He’s off the ventilator, so the road to recovery has begun,” agent Andrew Wylie said in a statement. “It will be long; the injuries are severe, but his condition is headed in the right direction.” 
The suspected assailant, 24-year-old Hadi Matar from New Jersey, was wrestled to the ground by staff and other audience members before being taken into police custody.
He was later arraigned in court and pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges. Police and prosecutors have provided scant information about Matar’s background or the possible motivation behind the attack.
Matar’s family appears to come from Yaroun, a village in southern Lebanon, but he was born in the United States, according to a Lebanese official.
Hadi Matar is being held without bail and has been formally charged with second-degree attempted murder and assault with a weapon.
‘Online threat’ to J.K. Rowling
Scottish police said on Sunday they were investigating an apparent “online threat” made to Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling in response to her tweet supporting Salman Rushdie following his stabbing.
“We have received a report of an online threat being made and officers are carrying out inquiries,” said a police spokeswoman. The 57-year-old Rowling tweeted on Friday that she  was “feeling very sick right now” as news broke of the attack on Salman Rushdie. In response, a user tweeted “Don’t worry you are next”.
Rowling shared a screenshot of the reply, asking Twitter moderators “any chance of some support?”   “These are your guidelines, right? `Violence: You may not threaten violence against an individual or a group of people’,” she added.
The tweet appeared to have been taken down on Sunday. The author also tweeted that police had been informed. The same Twitter account, believed to be based in Pakistan, also posted messages praising Rushdie’s attacker.

A search warrant released last week after the unprecedented search showed that Trump had 11 sets of classified documents at his home, and that the Justice Department had probable cause to conduct the search based on possible Espionage Act violations.
Republicans are calling for the disclosure of more detailed information that persuaded a federal judge to issue the search warrant, which may show sources of information and details about the nature of the documents and other classified information. The unsealing of such affidavits is highly unusual and would require approval from a federal judge.
“I think a releasing the affidavit would help, at least that would confirm that there was justification for this raid,” Republican Senator Mike Rounds told NBC’s  “Meet the Press”.
“The Justice Department should  “show that this was not just a fishing expedition, that they had due cause to go in and to do this, that they did exhaust all other means,” Rounds said.  “And if they can’t do that, then we’ve got a serious problem on our hands.”  The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Representative Mike Turner, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said on CNN on Sunday that the Biden administration should provide more details on what led to the raid.
“Congress is saying, ‘Show us. We want to know what did the FBI tell them? What did they find?’” Turner said.
Representative Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, did not address the issue of the affidavit on Sunday.
He said it was  “most disturbing” that Trump continued to hold the classified documents after the Justice Department sought their return.  “It appears to be willful on the president’s part, the keeping of these documents after the government was requesting them back,” he told CBS’  “Face the Nation.”

The fire was raging in the Aragon region where around 300 firefighters are trying to contain the blaze with the help of helicopters.
At least 1,500 people were evacuated from the rural region that includes a natural park in the Zaragoza province, the regional government said. The Aragon emergency services estimate  “thousands” of hectares have been destroyed by the fire.
The  “rapid spread” of the flames, stoked by winds, is  “critical”, the regional president, Javier Lamban, told media. Spain has faced 388 wildfires since the start of the year, fuelled by scorching temperatures and drought conditions.
The blazes have destroyed 261,930 hectares in Spain this year, more than in any other country in Europe, according to data from the European Forest Fire Information System.
Scientists say human-induced climate change is making extreme weather events including heatwaves and droughts more frequent and more intense. They in turn increase the risk of fires, which emit climate heating greenhouse gases.
Fires have blazed in other European countries including France, Greece and Portugal, making 2022 a record year for wildfire activity on the continent.

A Malian judicial source said a Bamako prosecutor charged the soldiers on Friday. They have already been detained for more than a month. Another source close to the judge and an official at Mali’s justice ministry confirmed.
Ivory Coast has denied the accusation and demanded the troops be released, saying they were reinforcements to the UN peacekeeping mission in Mali, MINUSMA.
Negotiations have started to free the soldiers, with Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe acting as a mediator.
A source close to the talks said they had made some progress but stalled over  “certain points, stalled on certain points”, which might explain the return to the judicial process.

As of Sunday morning, Deputy President William Ruto was slightly ahead of his rival Raila Odinga, data from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) showed, before cutting off the live feed displaying the percentage of votes won by both men.
The IEBC, which has now tallied votes from just over 60 percent of constituencies, did not give an explanation for the decision, but the Daily Nation newspaper said Ruto had scored 52.46 percent of the vote, while Odinga had 46.87 percent, citing official data.
Tuesday’s vote passed off largely peacefully but after previous elections sparked deadly violence and rigging claims, the IEBC is under intense pressure to deliver a clean poll and release results by August 16.
Riot police were deployed overnight inside the commission’s heavily-guarded tallying centre in the capital Nairobi after political party agents disrupted the process, hurling rigging allegations at each other. IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has accused party agents of delaying the tallying process by haranguing election workers with unnecessary questions.
More than a dozen civil society groups, trade unions as well as the Kenyan chapters of Amnesty International and Transparency International issued a statement urging calm.
“We call on all political candidates, their supporters and the public to exercise restraint. We must all avoid raising tensions that could easily trigger violence,” the 14 organisations said.

The exodus of Rohingya was sparked by a 2017 Myanmar army offensive against the mostly Muslim minority, with the UN’s highest court last month giving the green light to a landmark case accusing the Buddhist-majority country of genocide.
Five years later the refugees refuse to go home in the absence of guarantees for their safety and rights from military-ruled Myanmar, making host country Bangladesh increasingly impatient.
Bangladesh, meanwhile, has come under fire for its own rights record under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whom Bachelet will meet during her visit, as well as local activists.
Nine groups including Human Rights Watch said that Bachelet should  “publicly call for an immediate end to serious abuses including extrajudicial killings, torture, and enforced disappearances” in Bangladesh.
In December the United States imposed sanctions on a notorious elite police unit and seven top security officers, including the national police chief, over gross human rights violations.

16,Bullet Train again claims top slot amid box office slowdown,LOS ANGELES: Is everyone on vacation?  That would be one plausible explanation behind the great box office slowdown....,"LOS ANGELES: Is everyone on vacation?  That would be one plausible explanation behind the great box office slowdown. Although three new movies opened nationwide, none were able to crack the top five on domestic charts and only two — A24’s satirical slasher  “Bodies Bodies Bodies” and Lionsgate’s vertigo-inducing thriller  “Fall” — managed to infiltrate the top 10.
It’s even more dire that Sony’s action-thriller  “Bullet Train,” which claimed the top spot for the second weekend in a row with $13.1 million from 4,357 North American locations, was the sole film to bank at least $10 million in ticket sales. 
After two weeks on the big screen, the Brad Pitt-led  “Bullet Train” has generated $54.4 million at the domestic box office. This weekend marks the first time since Feb. 11-13 — when  “Death on the Nile” opened to a weak $12.3 million and Jennifer Lopez’s romantic comedy  “Marry Me” stumbled with even less — that only one movie reached at least $10 million between Friday and Sunday.
And the glacial drip, drip, drip of ticket sales is only going to worsen as the box office heads for a near desolate stretch with hardly any new offerings from major studios on the horizon. While movie theater owners brace for the downtrend, they are bowing at the altar of Harry Styles in hopes the pop heartthrob will inspire audiences to return to theaters in droves for director Olivia Wilde’s mind-bender  “Don’t Worry Darling,” which doesn’t open until Sept 23. 
Until then, exhibitors will have to make do with smaller thrillers and dramas like Idris Elba’s  “Beast,” which is coming on Aug. 19;  “Three Thousand Years of Longing,” a fantasy romance with Tilda Swinton and Elba (again) on Aug 26; and the Viola Davis-led historical epic  “The Woman King” on Sept 16.
In eighth place,  “Bodies Bodies Bodies” beat expectations with $3.2 million from 1,290 locations. After kicking off last weekend in limited release, the movie has grossed $3.5 million to date and plans to expand to 2,000+ theaters next weekend. But otherwise, audiences wanted little to do with  “Fall” and Diane Keaton’s body-swap comedy  “Mack & Rita,” the other movie that debuted over the weekend.
“Fall” just barely landed in 10th place with $2.5 million from 1,548 venues. The movie, centering on two best friends who climb 2,000 feet to the top of an abandoned radio tower and find themselves stranded with no way down, was relatively low risk for Lionsgate as it cost only $3 million to produce and less than $4 million to promote. It won’t take much coinage to turn a profit, and home entertainment will be helpful with that mission.
Elsewhere, Steven Spielberg’s science-fiction classic  “E.T.” — which debuted 40 years ago — grossed more money over the weekend than Keaton’s  “Mack and Rita.” The Gravitas Ventures release premiered in 13th place with $1.03 million from 1,930 screens. Universal’s re-release of  “E.T.” raked in $1.07 million from only 389 Imax screens.
As expected,  “Mack and Rita” brought out mostly older women, with 74pc of ticket buyers identifying as female and 69pc over the age of 30. They were not kind to the movie, which landed a  “D+” CinemaScore. Reviews were equally harsh, resulting in a bleak 26pc score on Rotten Tomatoes. 
With the dismal turnout for most other movies, Paramount’s ever-powerful blockbuster  “Top Gun: Maverick” swooped to second place in its 12th weekend of release. The action sequel added $7.1 million from 3,181 venues over the weekend, bringing its domestic tally to $673.8 million. That means  “Maverick” is roughly $5 million away from dethroning Marvel’s  “Avengers: Infinity War” as the sixth-highest grossing movie in domestic box office history.
