He said the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) was moving towards digitization of its internal business processes and customer services. He said the measure would improve the work flow and ensure the transparency of operations. The company announced a profit of Rs10.99 billion by bringing down the UFG (unaccounted for gas).

1,Sheranwala Gate Flyover formal opening a matter of days,LAHORE: The construction work on the Rs5 billion Sheranwala Gate Flyover and at-grade (groundwork) infrastructural...,"LAHORE: The construction work on the Rs5 billion Sheranwala Gate Flyover and at-grade (groundwork) infrastructural development project has almost been completed, paving the way for its formal opening by end of this month.  
The project’s major portion -- overhead bridge (renamed Data Gang Bakhsh bridge) -- had already been opened to traffic in May this year.
“We can confidently say that almost 99 per cent of work has been completed. Hopefully, we will get it formally inaugurated by end of this month,” Lahore Development Authority (LDA) Project Director Iqrar Hussain told Dawn on Saturday.  
“At present, we are completing some minor works (footpaths etc) at a fast pace,” he added.
The construction work on the project had been launched in June last year and was set to be completed on March 18 this year. However, various issues such as delay in land acquisition at tyre market and other areas affected the pace of work on the project. The Rs5bn project cost includes Rs2.634bn for construction.
The beneficiary areas of the project include Lahore’s northern parts (railway station, Walled City, Akbari Mandi, Azam Cloth Market, Lunda Bazaar, Badami Bagh, Shadbagh, Misri Shah, GT Road, Shah Alam Market, Data Darbar area, Brandreth Road and Azadi Chowk). According to project brief, the mega scheme will ease passing of 130,000 vehicles daily besides controlling environmental pollution caused by dust or vehicular emissions.
The four-lane flyover’s total length and width with ramps is 1,000 meters and 17 meters, respectively, with 19 spans. The flyover’s construction involves 189 piles, 20 piles caps, 18 piers, two abutments, laying of 19 deck slabs and retaining walls.
The project, which is said to save Rs86 million, Rs163m and Rs184m as annual fuel cost, vehicle operating cost and travel time saving, respectively, was planned to be completed in March this year but it could not be owing to delay in handing over of land acquired by the government at tyre market. The project’s construction cost includes Rs1 billion spent on the execution of several at-grade infrastructural development works.  
“The continuous rains during the ongoing monsoon is also one of the major reasons behind delay in completion of at-grade construction works,” the LDA officer said, adding that the remaining work on walkways (300 meters long on both sides of the extended portion) would be completed by end of this month.
MINISTER: At a meeting, Minister for Housing and Urban Development Mian Aslam Iqbal was given a detailed briefing on the development projects launched by the LDA in the city on Saturday.
LDA DG Amer Ahmed Khan told the minister that the work on the Sherawala Gate project had been completed and it would be inaugurated soon.
“The sports complex at Sabzazar will also be inaugurated next week whereas the sports complexes at Shahdara, Singapura, Shalimar, Kahna and other areas of the city are being built at a fast pace,” the DG said. He said rehabilitation and improvement work of roads around Babu Sabu interchange were about to complete whereas the road rehabilitation work of Saggian Road was also going on rapidly.
The minister said resources were available for the development schemes and the relevant institutions should work diligently and complete them on a priority.
“You are also required to accelerate the pace of work on the improvement schemes of entrance and exit roads of Lahore,” he said, adding that the development schemes for providing transportation and other facilities to the citizens should be completed by working day and night.
LWMC: The Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) claims to have collected and disposed of tonnes of solid waste ahead of the Independence Day celebrations.
“The cleaning of the city is under way as tonnes of waste has been lifted,” LWMC MD Ms Rafia Haidar said in a statement on Saturday.  
She said a special cleaning operation had also been carried out on Fort Road and its surroundings for the flag-hoisting ceremony at Hazuri Bagh.
“Furthermore, cleaning operations are also conducted on the Mall Road, at Liberty Chowk, Allah Ho roundabout and on Canal Road,” she added.

One such activity -- a wall painting competition -- was held at the Township Model Bazaar, where more than 50 participants played with colours.  
Teams comprising students of different Lahore-based universities and colleges were allocated spaces on a wall where they made theme-based paintings.  
One of the teams painted the Badshahi Mosque, showing it submerged in floodwater.  
The team members, Sonia Kamal, Shafaq Amjad and Iqra Ali, highlighted the rising threat of climate change. “An elevated place like Badshahi Mosque could someday be in the news for being inundated by floodwater if we do not take action on climate change,” apprehended one of the team members.  
A team comprising Ayesha Naeem, Sara Mateen and Maheen Hashmi chose interfaith harmony as the theme for its artistic expression. “Pakistan is blessed with different cultures, and our work stresses the need to celebrate the diversity of culture,” says Ayesha.  
Another painting highlighted women’s issues.  
A team from the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) architecture department painted a picture showing that people, not land, make Pakistan.  
Other than the wall painting, the Punjab Model Bazaar Management organised an Azadi Gala at the Township Model Bazaar where Industries Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi was the chief guest.  
In his address, the secretary said Pakistan’s 75th Independence Day celebrations remind us that our forefathers made immense sacrifices for the freedom.  
He gave away prizes to the winners -- Usman Khalid, Mahnoor Habib and Ahsan Hayat.  
Apart from this, a large number of people from across the province set up more than 100 stalls of handicraft and food in Azadi Gala. 
In another activity, 45 children enrolled in the Sunday School for Working Children, a project of the Step Skills Development Foundation, exhibited their artistic and vocational skills.  The school provides basic education and vocational skills to the students. They performed on the famous speech of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, which guarantees equal rights to minorities. They also sang national songs and displayed their artworks and vocational skills at an exhibition. Gouhar Pirzada, the chairperson of the foundation, said such Sunday schools should be launched across the country as it was a matter of concern that Pakistan had still more than 22 million out-of-school children. Project Director Farhat Majeed said the project enrolled children for completion of their 10-year long formal education.    
Moreover, the Ideas9, a body dedicated to promoting interfaith harmony, celebrated the Independence Day with the 6th Annual Intrafaith Gathering and Plant Distribution event which was attended by a large number of people belonging to different schools of thought.  
As Independence Day fell in Muharram this year, the event paid homage to Imam Hussain (AS) calling him a great leader of freedom and justice.  
Keynote speaker Maulana Absar Ali Naqvi said the Karbala incident was all about justice and freedom. The participants were given plants. Hunain Zaidi, one of the organisers, said: “We need to make Pakistan as a state where people of all faiths could live peacefully”.

8,"55 SPs, DSPs transferred in Punjab ‘for action against PTI workers’",Official source claims Punjab govt is pressuring IGP for action against officers who used excessive force ahead of May 25 march.,"LAHORE: The inspector general of police (IGP) has reshuffled 12 superintendents of police (SPs) of Lahore, making four of them officers on special duty (OSDs). 
Those made OSDs included City Division SP Akhlaqullah, Iqbal Town investigation SP Rizwan Tariq, Sadar division SP Mohammad Imran and Model Town division operations SP Waqar Azeem. 
SPs Akhlaq, Imran and Waqar were removed from their posts on the complaint of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders, an official told Dawn. 
The IGP transferred 43 deputy superintendents of police (DSPs), most of them from Lahore. Of them, seven DSPs were made OSDs again on the complaint of the PTI leadership for their victimization of PTI leaders and workers during the previous government, the official claimed. 
The official also claimed the actions recommended included termination or suspension of the ‘unwanted police officers’, which are being opposed by the top police bosses. The bosses say such actions would demoralize the police force. Consequently, the police officers were removed from the post only, the official source said, adding that the chief minister directed the IGP not to make the posting of these police officers in any part of the province “till further orders”. 
The official claimed the transfer of SPs and DSPS of Lahore ‘in one go’ was a mistake to leave the provincial capital on the ‘inexperienced officers’. 
In the past, he claimed, transfers and postings of such officers in Lahore on the political grounds used to be made in phases. 
The official source claimed that the government was pressuring the IGP to take action against those police officers who used excessive force against its leaders and the workers ahead of its May 25 Azadi March. 
Similarly, some police officers were marked for their controversial role during the by-elections of July 17 as they favoured the PML-N candidates. 
There are reports, the official claimed, that the PTI leadership wants the removal of all the officials identified and other departmental actions against them.

9,Probe into Layyah case being widened,Layyah City police claim about half a dozen suspects have been taken into custody.,"BAHAWALPUR: South Punjab Additional Inspector General of Police Dr Ehsan Sadiq says that the scope of the investigation in to the Layyah ‘pornography’ case will be widened and police will soon find out the facts of the case. 
In a press release issued from the AIG’s office on Sunday, it was claimed that all the suspects would soon be arrested.  
Dr Sadiq said the police officials tasked with the assignment were working honestly on its investigation. He said the real culprits would be traced and arrested and all those involved in the case would be exposed with the use of the latest technology. He said the facts would be made public and after the completion of investigation shortly. 
It may be recalled presently a joint investigation team (JIT) of South Punjab police is engaged to find out the persons involved in the case and the investigation is being personally overseen by the additional IGP.

The Layyah City police claimed that about half a dozen accused allegedly involved in the case have been taken into custody while the raids were going on for the arrest of the remaining suspects.

They claimed that the ringleader, with the connivance of women and men, was involved by preparing objectionable videos and selling them. 
However, the JIT has not completed its investigation yet.

10,Imran conspiring to create divisions in army: Ahsan Iqbal,Alleges conspiracy being hatched at behest of Imran's “external sponsors”.,"NAROWAL: Imran Khan has been conspiring to divide the Pakistani Army at the behest of his “external sponsors”, said Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal here on Sunday.  
Speaking at flag-hoisting ceremony attended by PML-N local leaders and workers, former interior minister said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman wanted to get “real freedom” by breaking the army’s discipline. 
He said Imran Khan was doing “political sabotage” in Pakistan by taking funds from India and Israel.  
He said the party Quaid Nawaz Sharif would return to Pakistan before the next general election.  
Mr Iqbal said it had always been the PML-N’s stance that the institution of the army should remain away from politics.  
He said whenever the situation in Pakistan improved and the country’s economy started moving towards development, Imran started staging sit-ins and strikes in the country, citing the PTI’s 2013 agitation that resulted in postponement of the Chinese president’s visit to Pakistan.  
He also alleged that Imran Khan had ruined the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.  
He said after the PTI’ government emptied the country’s coffers, the genie of poverty and inflation came out of the bottle, while the country was crushed under the burden of external debt.  
He said that after Pakistan went for nuclear tests in 1998, restrictions were imposed on it, but the situation was not as bad as it was during Imran’s government.  
Terming Imran’s slogan of “real freedom” the biggest joke on the country, Ahsan Iqbal said it could not be achieved by destroying the country’s economy or plunging it into debt crisis and destroying projects like CPEC.  
He said real freedom could only be achieved by strengthening the country’s economy and freeing it of foreign debt.  
Blasting Imran’s claims of “saying no to slavery”, he said the PTI chairman was sending envoys to US and begging the American ambassador for arranging a meeting with President Biden.  
He said if Imran Niazi was contesting by-election from nine constituencies of the National Assembly, it clearly meant that the PTI had no candidates there.  
Ahsan Iqbal said now Imran Khan himself was seeking ‘NRO’ in the foreign-funding case, but “we will not give it to him”.  
He claimed that Imran was repeatedly sending messages, seeking reconciliation and closure of the foreign funding case, but it would not be closed now.  
“You stole billions of rupees. You spread chaos in politics by taking funds from Pakistan’s enemies. You have campaigned against national institutions. Imran Khan, you will have to answer this,” he said.  
Imran Khan launched only one “mega project” in the country and that was the politics of abuse.

13,PETA against brutal treatment of animals in vet schools,LAHORE: On an appeal from the US-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) on rectal palpation’...,"LAHORE: On an appeal from the US-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) on rectal palpation’ drills on cows in Pakistani vet schools, the University of Veterinary  and Animal Sciences (UVAS) Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Nasim Ahmad on Sunday said strict measures were being taken to ensure painless surgical procedures and training involving animals in the veterinary institutes. 
PETA motto that reads “animals are not ours to experiment on...” opposes speciesism, a human-supremacist worldview. 
The appeal reads that PETA has just received a disturbing whistleblower report that students at the College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (CVAS), Jhang, a UVAS sub-campus, and other veterinary colleges across Pakistan are using healthy, live cows and buffaloes to conduct invasive and painful training exercises. 
In response, the group sent urgent letters to UVAS VC and the Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council (PVMC) President Prof Dr Masood Rabbani, urging them to adopt Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent Islamabad Capital Territory Reforms guidelines that prohibit the use of live animals in testing and surgical veterinary training and require switching to animal-free simulation models immediately. 
According to the whistleblower report, at CVAS alone, more than 100 students a day use irritant solutions and rectally palpate cows and buffaloes, often forcefully. Two students reportedly inserted their entire arms, causing bleeding. Students also reportedly use artificial insemination rods daily, causing lacerations and bleeding to the animals’ reproductive organs. After their internal organs have been damaged, the animals are auctioned off for slaughter, the report says. 
“Violating animals’ rectums and vaginas dozens of times a day until their bodies give out, after which they’re sold for slaughter, is barbaric,” says PETA Vice President Shalin Gala. “PETA is calling on Pakistan’s veterinary authorities to adopt and nationalise Prime Minister Sharif’s historic reforms that prohibit live testing of animals in veterinary colleges, and replace all painful, invasive exercises with superior and humane simulation models.” 
Just last month, Gala, PETA president Ingrid Newkirk, and other representatives of the group held a historic meeting with Salman Sufi (head of PM’s Strategic Reforms Unit) to discuss veterinary school reforms and other issues. The meeting followed a shocking video footage showing dogs, who had reportedly been kidnapped from the streets, lying in pools of blood and excreta after being operated on without anesthetics, prompting Sufi to announce, “Live testing of animals in vet colleges and industrial complexes is banned from today in Islamabad Capital Territory.” 
Among other strategies, the group discussed how to help veterinary schools switch to modern teaching tools, including the Bovine Breeder artificial insemination simulator and the SynDaver Surgical Canine — which allow students to practice critical skills without harming any animal. Other strategic reforms that the group is pursuing in potential collaboration with Sufi include replacing the use of animals in medical training and classroom dissection exercises, setting up a national non-animal research method database, modernising biomedical research through the group’s Research Modernization Deal, and establishing a school programme teaching empathy for animals. 
Mr Ahmad further said the two to four percent errors would happen during the training because they lacked the latest machinery and surgical instruments to train the students.He said still most of the veterinary universities in the country were using traditional and primitive means for training the students.He said there were societies established in universities and on campuses to ensure painless surgical training and the errors were not repeated. 
Sufi told Dawn that animal welfare law was part of Prime Minister’s Reforms programme that would soon be tabled. 
He said since the matter was brought into his knowledge, the SRU is working on it and also held a discussion with the PETA officials in this regard.

At the end of the colonial era, it was theoretically possible to have a united India but it didn’t happen. All the major players involved failed to find a common ground and reach a consensus. The British colonialists, the Indian Congress, the Muslim League and Sikh leadership pulled in different directions as each had its own agenda to apparently safeguard its interests in the name of the entity it broadly represented. Their spectacular failure eventually resulted in the Partition with deadly consequences never seen before in the history of the subcontinent. The only other epochal event that caused a seismic shift way back in time was the arrival or incursion of Aryan tribes which interacted and clashed with the people of Harappa civilization and helped create a new society with a changed way of life. 
The Partition, as a final solution to communal problem, may be called ‘double partition’ as it involved; 1), division of British India into two independent states, India and Pakistan. The former would be a majority Hindu state and the latter majority Muslim state. 2), a division of the Muslim majority Punjab and Bengal between India and Pakistan. The division of the former in particular had colossal repercussions for communities with diverse faiths, namely Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. 
The colonial administration, which boasted of its competence and efficiency and supposedly had an eye for detail, proved to be a god with feet of clay when the crunch came. Political leadership representing different communities involved were found either unequal to the task or grossly derelict in their historical responsibility of ensuring the communal harmony while executing the agenda of the Partition they had agreed on reluctantly. 
Punjab saw a horrendous mess never seen in its long history; within a span of a few months nearly one-and-a-half million people were killed in the bloody communal riots. It was an apocalyptic scene deadlier than what one finds painted in the books. It was all against all which left no one unhurt. Thousands of women were raped and abducted. In the western part of the Punjab the Hindus and the Sikhs were massacred while in the eastern part similar fate befell the Muslims. In this dance of communal madness, even death, to borrow a phrase from Lord Shiva’s Rudra dance, was destroyed. Between 15 and 20 million people had to cross borders in utter misery and dread. 
The few months that witnessed the communal Armageddon got etched in the collective memory of the people irrespective of their faith. This collective ghoulish experience is marked by certain unmistakable features. It is independence from a potentially perpetual majoritarian rule for the Punjabi Muslims who would form a dominant segment in the new state. The sacrifices, they were forced to make, were worth the cause. The memory of their sufferings serves as a bulwark against fissiparous tendencies in the new state. The unintended consequences of this obsession with the centralist control of the state evoked and still evoke hostile reaction from the other nationalities that constitute the historically multinational state of Pakistan. Collective mind describes the Partition and what it entailed by using so many different epithets that have painful connotations. It’s called, for example, in Punjabi language ‘Loti/ Lotian (loot and plunder)’, ‘Ujaara (dislodging and devastation)’, ‘Dungay/Fasaad (riots)’ and ‘Harjula (forced migration)’ etc. All this evokes the cost of independence rather than a feeling of being independent. 
The dislocation caused deep anguish among the migrants, especially in view of unfair and fraudulent allotment of evacuees’ properties left behind by fleeing rich Hindu businessmen and Sikh landlords to the rich and powerful at the cost of the displaced. Chicanery in bestowing official largesse on the undeserving resulted in the destruction of socio-cultural fabric and emergence of a class of nouveaux riches that craved for nothing other than crass material interests and unearned privileges. The far-reaching implications of such shenanigans surfaced in strengthening the hold of civil and military bureaucracy and judiciary as their authority had the power of making and unmaking in a new state where rules of the games were not transparent. The powerful, while not being part of the state apparatus, could easily circumvent the opaque setup. 
The Punjabis, Sikh and Hindu, in the eastern part of Punjab carry, what they call, a wound inflicted by the division of Punjab. The Sikhs were deprived of their religious history whose broad footprints are largely found in the western part where Baba Guru Nanak, the pioneer of Sikh religion, and other early Gurus belonged. Besides, even after the collapse of Maharaja Ranjit’s kingdom, the Sikh nobility had large estates in the western part, which they had to abandon in 1947. Similarly, the Punjabi Hindus who were dominant in business and urban society had to flee their historical homeland, leaving their huge wealth and assets behind.  
Sadly, official histories, both in India and Pakistan, fail to recognise and square with the peoples’ sufferings, which are indescribable even by the mightiest pen. All historical accounts carry disguised communal angles. What is lacking is the peoples’ narrative reflecting the actual sufferings of those who bore the brunt of division of Punjab. Muslims and non-Muslim Punjabis, in other words, all are haunted by the spectre of 1947 holocaust and the greatest exodus of their history. “You wept/ We wept too,” said poet Ustad Daman in Amritsar after the Partition. What is needed is the moral courage and intellectual integrity for all the communities concerned to face fairly and squarely the atrocities committed by them against one another at the time of independence in a collective communal frenzy. Denial or distortion of facts shall not square with our collective conscience. We shall never be at peace unless we admit our epochal insanity, inexcusable excesses and forgive one another with a promise never to engage again in a fratricidal struggle. — soofi01@hotmail.com
