0,"Conte, Tuchel see red as Kane snatches Spurs draw at Chelsea",Both managers sent off after full-time whistle for second physical altercation of the match.,"LONDON: Harry Kane snatched a 96th minute equaliser to salvage a 2-2 draw for Tottenham from a feisty London derby against Chelsea on Sunday.
Both managers Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel were sent-off after the full-time whistle for their second physical altercation of the match.
Chelsea looked set to get a new era at Stamford Bridge off to the best possible start as they twice led through Kalidou Koulibaly and Reece James.
Tottenham were well off the level required if they are to live up to hopes of challenging Manchester City and Liverpool for the title, but showed the newfound character instilled by Conte to fight back for a point.
The Italian and Tuchel were both booked in the aftermath of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s first equaliser.
Tempers then flared again during a handshake after Kane nodded in with virtually the last action of the game.
Tottenham have still only won once at Stamford Bridge in 32 years in the league, but Conte will be delighted to escape with a share of the spoils against his former club.
New Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly was welcomed by a huge banner from the Chelsea support and saw an early return on the near 170 million ($206 million) investment in the transfer market since he sanctioned a 2.5 billion takeover to buy the club from Roman Abramovich.
Despite the drastic changes in the boardroom, on the field it was like the old times under Abramovich as Chelsea outthought, outplayed and outmuscled Spurs for the first 45 minutes.
Two of Chelsea’s new signings combined for the opening goal as it was from Marc Cucurella’s corner that Koulibaly found space to volley home.
Conte again resisted the temptation to start any of his six new signings, but it was not until the introduction of Richarlison just before the hour mark and a switch of formation that Tottenham began to threaten.
Kane had a glorious chance to level when he uncharacteristically dragged wide with only Edouard Mendy to beat.
Spurs did level 22 minutes from time in controversial fashion to light the spark between the two managers.

Kai Havertz looked to be clearly fouled by Rodrigo Bentancur before Tottenham broke forward and the ball eventually fell to Hojbjerg to fire low and hard past Mendy.
Tuchel reacted furiously to the decision and Conte’s overzealous celebration.
The German fought fire with fire as he sprinted down the touchline to celebrate when James thrashed home Raheem Sterling’s pass to restore Chelsea’s lead 13 minutes from time.
However, Kane had the final say as he flicked in Ivan Perisic’s corner deep into added time.
Earlier, Nottingham Forest celebrated their first home game in the Premier League for 23 years by beating West Ham United 1-0.
The two-time European champions have made 14 new signings in a bid to maintain their top-flight status and two of those making their home debuts were the stars as Taiwo Awoniyi scored the only goal and Dean Henderson saved Declan Rice’s penalty.
Forest had fortune on their side as the Hammers also had a first-half goal controversially ruled out and hit the underside of the crossbar twice after the break through Pablo Fornals and Said Benrahma.
But that mattered little to a jubilant 30,000 crowd at the City Ground, who revelled in their first three points back in the big time.
BRENTFORD HUMILIATE UNITED
A shambolic Manchester United side conceded four goals in the opening  35 minutes in a 4-0 drubbing at Brentford on Saturday as their woeful  start to the Premier League season continued.
United’s seventh  successive away league defeat was assured long before the interval as  Brentford took ruthless advantage of a catalogue of errors by the  visitors.
The rout began in the 10th minute when United keeper David de Gea allowed a weak shot by Josh Dasilva to slip past him.
Things  got worse for United eight minutes later when De Gea played the ball  out to former Brentford player Christian Eriksen who was caught in  possession and Mathias Jensen slotted home.
When United’s defence  failed to deal with a corner and Ben Mee glanced in a close-range header  to make it 3-0 the Brentford fans were ecstatic while United’s new  manager Erik ten Hag looked ashen-faced in his technical area.
Brentford’s  fourth was a gem as Ivan Toney delivered a diagonal ball to Bryan  Mbeumo from a counter-attack and Mbeumo calmly beat De Gea.
Ten  Hag made three substitutions at halftime with Raphael Varane, Tyrell  Malacia and Scott McTominay coming on but despite a slight improvement  United offered little fight.
Brentford’s fans serenaded their  players with  “Hey Jude” at the final whistle while United’s players  looked crestfallen as they trudged off rock bottom of the table having  also lost their opener at home to Brighton & Hove Albion.
It was the first time since 1960 that United  have conceded at least six goals in their first two matches of a  top-flight season and the first time they have lost their opening two  matches since 1992 when they went on to win the title. 
This side, however, looks woefully  inadequate to mount any kind of challenge and Ten Hag, who was taunted  by the Brentford fans, appears to have a huge job on his hands. 
The Dutchman is the first Manchester United manager to lose his first two games in charge since John Chapman in 1921. 
“It’s easy to dismantle this United side, just be organised and fight and you’re there,” said former United player and Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville said. 
For Brentford, whose starting line-up cost in the region of 55 million compared to the more than 400 million of United’s, have picked up four points in their first two games. 
United has Cristiano Ronaldo back in their starting line-up but the Portuguese forward barely got a look in. 
The confidence drained out of United from the moment De Gea allowed Dasilva’s shot to end up in the back of the net. 
Eriksen, who got a mixed reception from Brentford’s fans, then inadvertently gifted his former club their second as United looked shell shocked by the energy of their hosts who went on to record their biggest top-flight victory since 1938.

The 30-year-old sustained the injury during this week’s four-day tour match against the second-string England Lions in Canterbury and Olivier, a veteran of 15 Tests, is now returning home.
“Duanne presented with significant discomfort involving his right hip flexor muscle at the close of play on day three of the four-day tour match,” said Proteas team doctor Hashendra Ramjee in a Cricket South Africa statement issued Sunday.
“After clinical assessment, he was referred for an MRI scan which revealed a grade two tear involving the right pectineus muscle.
“Due to the extent of the injury, he has been ruled out of the three-match Test series against England and will return home where he will commence his rehabilitation with the Gauteng Central Lions medical team.” South Africa have not named a replacement for Olivier, with fellow quicks Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi and Anrich Nortje already in their squad.
The first Test at Lord’s is scheduled to start on Wednesday.

Henry first experienced the pain in his left side during training last week and coach Gary Stead said they replaced the player to ensure he did not aggravate the injury.
“It’s a shame for Matt to have to return home at this point of the tour,” Stead said.
“Although the injury is not overly serious — we felt there was a significant risk it would become worse through playing.
“With the upcoming ODI series starting on Wednesday and consisting of three games over five days, we saw it as prudent to bring in a fully-fit replacement.”  Sears, who has played six Twenty20 Internationals, will join the squad in Jamaica on Sunday before flying out to Bridgetown which hosts the first ODI.
“Ben comes fresh from a successful tour with the Blackcaps in Europe and while he is yet to play ODI cricket — we believe hes ready if called upon,” Stead said.
“At 24-years-old he’s an exciting young prospect and we like the pace and skills he possesses.”

The leg-spinner claimed 4-15 to fire Trent Rockets to a 43-run victory against Manchester Originals who, chasing 120 for victory, were bundled out for 76.
King dismissed Cordelia Griffith, Sophie Ecclestone and Kate Cross in successive deliveries to claim a hat-trick at Old Trafford.

6,Nadal puts fitness atop his Cincinnati priority list,"""Number one is nice but staying healthy is the most important thing,"" he says.","CINCINNATI: Rafael Nadal is keeping expectations in check while focusing on fitness as he prepares for the Cincinnati Masters.
The world number three, who handed in an abdominal muscle injury walkover in his Wimbledon semi-final with Nick Kyrgios, takes the second seeding behind Daniil Medvedev in the American Midwest at the joint ATP and WTA tournament.
With Novak Djokovic missing due to his refusal to get a Covid-19 vaccination, the 36-year-old Spaniard has one less dangerous opponent to deal with at the US Open tuneup.
Nadal could return to the top ranking spot for the first time since January 2020, which would mean a top seeding at the US Open starting on August 29.
That could come to pass if he wins the Cincinnati title and Medvedev fails to reach the quarter-finals.
But for Nadal, it’s all about keeping healthy, letting the results fall where they may. 
“Number one is nice but staying healthy is the most important thing,” Nadal said on Sunday. 
“I don’t have a goal of returning to number one. 
“If that happens because I play very well, then it would mean a lot to have that opportunity.” 
The 2013 Cincinnati champion said that his goal will be to “stay healthy and finish the season playing where I want to play”.  
“I won’t play more than what I think will work for my body.” 
The Spaniard said that with a baby on the way, his playing schedule might have to be moderated.
“I’m happy to be in this position — if for some reason I return to number one, I’d be very happy.” 
Nadal, who has put in a brutal training schedule since arriving in Cincinnati at mid-week, said that still feels pain on serve from his injury.
But he said that obstacles are part of any comeback. 
“You cannot expect to play at an amazing level immediately. You have to be humble and use the tools that you have to win the first match,” Nadal said. 
“Once you win a few, things change. I’m not always having some good feelings on court. You need to accept that things will be difficult at first.”

7,New-look Barca frustrated by Rayo in season opener,MADRID: Barcelona were held 0-0 by Rayo Vallecano in their opening game of the La Liga season and had captain Sergio...,"MADRID: Barcelona were held 0-0 by Rayo Vallecano in their opening game of the La Liga season and had captain Sergio Busquets sent off late on.
The Catalans had 21 shots on goal and almost 70 per cent of possession at the Camp Nou but were unable to break the deadlock.
Barca boss Xavi started close-season signings including defender Andreas Christensen, winger Raphinha and striker Robert Lewandowski, who were only able to feature after being registered with the league late on Friday.
The five-time Champions League winners had to comply with La Liga’s strict financial controls before being able to confirm the likes of ex-Bayern Munich attacker Lewandowski in their squad ahead of the new campaign.“We tried as much as we could but we lacked aim and effectiveness. Maybe  the pressure and expectation got a little under our skin,” Barca coach Xavi Hernandez told  DAZN. 
“It will be a process, Rayo knew how to defend deep and hold on to their strategy with an outstanding discipline.   “We have to be patient and keep working. Better days will come.” The hosts dominated the opening half an hour as Lewandowski was denied a goal on his competitive debut.
The Poland forward was judged to be offside from an Ousmane Dembele pass before his delicate chipped finish was cancelled out.
As rain fell at the Camp Nou in temperatures of 26 degrees Celsius, Pedri came close to breaking the deadlock with 10 minutes of the half to play but his curling effort flew past the post.
Despite their first half control Marc Andre ter Stegen ensured the sides stayed level at the break with a fine save to stop Rayo’s Alvaro Garcia during injury time.
Barca continued their onslaught on the Rayo defence but were unable to beat goalkeeper Stole Dimitrievski, who was involved in two heavy collisions on his line within the first 10 minutes of the second half.
With half an hour to play Xavi brought on Frenkie de Jong for Gavi despite the Netherlands midfielder being linked with a move away from Catalunya to lighten club debt, which forced Lionel Messi to leave 12 months ago.
Xavi’s Rayo counterpart Andoni Iraola also made changes in the final 30 minutes including giving experienced Colombia striker Radamel Falcao his competitive debut.
With nine minutes left De Jong combined with Lewandowski but the 33-year-old’s shot skimmed the upright.
Seven minutes later another Barca summer signing was denied a goal as midfielder Franck Kessie was offside before beating Dimitrievski.
Xavi’s side ended the game with 10 men as club skipper Busquets was red-carded for an elbow on Falcao in the fourth of eight injury time minutes.
Less than 60 seconds later, Falcao thought he had scored the winner, and claimed Rayo’s third straight win over the Catalans, but was found to be offside and the visitors held on for the point.
Earlier, 21-year-old winger Alex Baena scored twice on just his eighth La Liga appearance as Villarreal beat Real Valladolid 3-0.
Forward Joselu claimed a point for Espanyol at Celta Viga with a 97th minute winner with a 2-2 draw after the Galicians’ veteran striker Iago Aspas scored his side’s opening goal of a season for a third straight campaign.

8,"Champions Milan off to winning start, Dumfries steals show for Inter",MILAN: AC Milan got off to a winning start in their Italian title defence with a hard-fought 4-2 win over Udinese on...,"MILAN: AC Milan got off to a winning start in their Italian title defence with a hard-fought 4-2 win over Udinese on Saturday as Denzel Dumfries’ stoppage-time strike earned Inter Milan a late win at Lecce.
Champions Milan bounced back from going behind with less than two minutes on the clock to claim the three points thanks to two goals from Ante Rebic, a Theo Hernando penalty and a strike from Brahim Diaz.
The margin of defeat was harsh on Udinese who acquitted themselves well in front of a raucous home crowd at the San Siro.
However three points and four goals were the perfect way for Milan to kick-off what is likely to be a tight title tussle in Italy, with no clear favourite ahead of the start of the campaign.
“What didn’t we like? Surely the fact that we conceded a goal in such a short time, we have to start games better,” Milan coach Stefano Pioli told broadcaster DAZN. 
Fans at a packed San Siro roared  “we are the champions” as the team came out on a balmy summer’s evening in Milan, but they were soon stunned into silence when Rodrigo Becao met Gerard Deulofeu’s corner with a header which squeezed past Mike Maignan.
Milan responded and were ahead with less than a quarter of a hour gone after a long VAR check on a clash between Davide Calabria and Udinese’s Brandon Soppy led to Hernandez smashing in his 12th-minute spot-kick. Rebic swept home the hosts’ second three minutes later.
A hugely entertaining first half ended with the Milan fans again wondering what was going on thanks to Adam Masina, whose diving header in the fourth minute of added time levelled the scores in spectacular fashion.
Masina then calmed the home side’s nerves when he handed Diaz a tap-in to put Milan back ahead, unwittingly nodding Hernandez’s cross into the Spaniard’s path.
Diaz was at the heart of things again in the 68th minute, pressuring Roberto Pereyra in the Udinese area before nicking the ball and rolling back a low pass which Rebic stretched to push in the fourth which sealed the win.
Dumfries stole the headlines on Romelu Lukaku’s return to Serie A with a 94th-minute strike just as Inter looked to have dropped points at newly-promoted Lecce.
Lukaku nodded home from close range with just 81 seconds gone to give Inter the lead at the Stadio Via del Mare, an ominous sign for Lecce as he had netted against the southern side on his Italian top flight debut in 2019, a 4-0 thumping for Inter at the San Siro.
However Marco Baroni’s side, pushed on by passionate home support, refused to be cowed by their more illustrious opponents and drew level less than two minutes after half-time through Assan Ceesay, who slipped in a precision finish after being neatly put through by Federico Di Francesco.
Kristijan Bistrovic and Lameck Banda both stung Samir Handanovic’s fingers in the Inter goal but the away side had chances to win as they pressed in the latter stages.
Dumfries headed off the post and Lukaku was denied by flying goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone just before the Netherlands wingback bundled in the winner which was harsh on the spirited hosts.
Silvio Berlusconi’s Monza were given a reality check in their first ever Serie A match, beaten at home 2-1 by Torino.
Aleksei Miranchuk opened the scoring two minutes from the break on his Torino debut, expertly finishing off Antonio Sanabria’s through ball following a quick passing move.
Sanabria doubled the away side’s lead with an acrobatic scissor kick midway through the second half, much to the disappointment of Berlusconi who was in the stands at the Stadio Brianteo.
Atalanta won Saturday’s other early match, 2-0 at Sampdoria through goals from Rafael Toloi and Ademola Lookman.

Neymar rolled in a spot-kick to put PSG 2-0 up at the break on a hot night at the Parc des Princes after Falaye Sacko’s own goal had put them ahead.
The Brazilian then headed in his second and PSG’s third shortly after the interval, taking his tally for the season to five goals already after just three games.
Wahbi Khazri pulled one back for Montpellier before Mbappe made it 4-1 and new signing Renato Sanches came off the bench to get the fifth late on.
Enzo Tchato notched another consolation for the visitors at the death but PSG have now recorded three wins out of three this season under new coach Christophe Galtier, scoring 14 goals in the process.
Neymar has picked up where he left off last season, when he scored nine in PSG’s final nine Ligue 1 matches.
So often plagued by fitness issues since arriving in Paris in 2017, he finally looks in rude health.
In contrast, Mbappe was playing his first competitive game since announcing on the final night of last season that he had agreed a new three-year deal to stay at PSG, turning down a move to Real Madrid in the process.
The France superstar missed his club’s first two games of the new campaign — a 4-0 defeat of Nantes in the season-opening Champions Trophy, and then the 5-0 win at Clermont — due first to suspension and then injury.
“Physically, we knew his lack of game time in pre-season would cost him,” Galtier told broadcaster Canal Plus when asked about Mbappe’s performance and attitude, with the 23-year-old appearing frustrated at times on the night.
“He is a competitor, he wants to be good, and he wants to be good quickly.” Mbappe, whose last match was against Gamba Osaka in Japan almost three weeks ago, had a penalty saved midway through the first half by Montpellier goalkeeper Jonas Omlin after the VAR spotted a handball in the area.
However, it was his shot that was diverted in by Sacko for an own goal to break the deadlock, and Mbappe later got his goal following a Neymar corner in the second half, but Galtier admitted the striker was not yet on peak form.
“A top-level footballer can’t just switch himself on or off. He needs time to be back to 100 per cent of his athletic ability and when he gets there he will make even more of a difference,” Galtier admitted.
“He likes to get forward and score goals and it is really quite normal that he should be, not disappointed, but a bit short of full fitness compared to his team-mates.” Meanwhile Neymar thought he had a hat-trick late on when he finished from a Lionel Messi pass, only for the celebrations to be cut short when the VAR spotted an offside in the build-up.
Earlier in Ligue 1, Monaco bounced back from their midweek Champions League elimination to draw 1-1 with Rennes.
Knocked out in the third qualifying round of Europe’s elite club competition by PSV Eindhoven, Monaco had Youssouf Fofana sent off inside 15 minutes at the Stade Louis II.
Axel Disasi then had a penalty saved for the hosts, and Gaetan Laborde put Rennes ahead before the hour mark.
However, Swiss forward Breel Embolo pounced on an error by Rennes substitute goalkeeper Dogan Alemdar to ensure a share of the spoils.

Leipzig’s midfielder Dominik Szoboszlai received a straight red card for an elbow to the throat of Cologne’s Florian Kainz just before half time.
Werner left Leipzig for London in 2020 before returning earlier this week in a 25 million ($30.2 million) deal.
Leipzig’s record goal-scorer put his side ahead in the 36th minute, when goalkeeper Marvin Schwaebe let Werner’s long-distance strike dip under his body and trickle across the line.
Cologne equalised just four minutes later however, when striker Florian Dietz dinked in from close range to chalk up his first ever Bundesliga goal. French forward Christopher Nkunku gave the home side the lead in the 56th minute, but Cologne were able to equalise with 20 minutes to go through a clumsy own goal from Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol.
After the game, Werner — who was subbed off to warm applause in the 68th minute — said he was  “very emotional” to return.
“It was something special for me, to return after two years.”  “Leipzig is always a part of me. I grew up here and I got my first Germany call up here”. In Saturday’s late game, Schalke secured a last-minute 2-2 draw with Borussia Moencheng­ladbach when Marius Buelter converted a penalty in injury time.
Schalke opened the scoring in the 29th minute thanks to a stunning solo goal from Rodrigo Zalazar, who dribbled the ball from halfway before scoring via a long-range strike from the edge of the penalty box.
Jonas Hofmann — fresh off a midweek contract extension — skidded the ball over the line in the 27th minute, before France’s Marcus Thuram put Gladbach in front just six minutes later. Gladbach winger Patrick Herrmann was adjudged to have handballed in the penalty area in injury time, giving Buelter the chance to convert from the spot.
Schalke striker Simon Terodde summed up his side’s emotional full-time celebrations.
“The people here — they’ve missed us,” he said.
“It’s beautiful that we could give them a point in the 93rd minute.”
Werder Bremen snatched a late point at home against Stuttgart through a 95th minute goal from Scottish winger Oliver Burke.
Bremen’s two-pronged attack of Niclas Fuel­l­krug and Marvin Ducksch again combined, putting the home side in the fourth minute.
Stuttgart equalised in the 38th minute through Wataru Endo and took the lead with just over ten to play through Silas Katompa Mvumpa, before Burke won a point for Bremen late.
Augsburg won 2-1 away at Bayer Leverkusen thanks to an 82nd minute goal from Andre Hahn, deepening the winless Leverkusen’s woes after their early German Cup exit.
In the German capital, Hertha Berlin drew 1-1 with Eintracht Frankfurt. Frankfurt had a late penalty overturned on VAR and Hertha held on to pick up their first point of the season.
In Sinsheim, Hoffenheim came from 2-0 down to win 3-2 against an impressive Bochum, thanks to goals from former Liverpool defender Ozan Kabak, Christoph Baumgartner and an 88th minute header from Munas Dabbur.

Poland’s Eighth-seeded Hurkacz needed two hours to claim a 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 victory over his Norwegian opponent, who had dropped just one set all week.
But his workload was minor compared to that of unseeded Spaniard Carreno Busta, who needed three hours to hold off Briton Daniel Evans 7-5, 6-7 (7/9), 6-2.
Carreno Busta had a match point in the second set tiebreaker but couldn’t close out victory for another 50 minutes, finally sprinting away as he won the last dozen points of the match.
Evans sent over his sixth double-fault of a long evening to surrender the contest.
Carreno Busta reached his first Masters final, where he’ll be vying to become the first unseeded Canadian champion since Argentina’s Guillermo Canas in 2002.
Against Ruud, Hurkacz finished with 47 winners - including 18 aces - and 19 unforced errors, advancing on his second match point.Ruud and Hurkacz traded early breaks, but the Norwegian gained the edge in the first set, winning it on another break of serve.
He then inflicted further punishment by breaking Hurkacz to love in the opening game of the second as he tried to set a tone for the remainder of the match.
But Hurkacz struck back with an immediate break and carried on to level the match at a set apiece.
Hurkacz got away quickly in the deciding set, grabbing a 4-1 lead with two quick breaks of serve before closing out the comeback triumph.
He avenged a loss to Ruud in the fourth round at Roland Garros two months ago.
Hurkacz has won his first five ATP finals and is keen to carry on with his string of victories.
HALEP TO FACE HADDAD MAIA 
Simona Halep dug deep to beat Jessica Pegula 2-6 6-3 6-4 to punch her ticket to Sunday’s Canadian Open  final where she will face Beatriz Haddad Maia after the Brazilian  toppled Karolina Pliskova for her latest win over a marquee player. 
Two-time tournament champion Halep got off to a sluggish start and  the American took full advantage, wrapping up the 35-minute first set  with an ace. 
But a loose service game by Pegula early in the second set, capped  by a unforced backhand error, gave the Romanian former world number one a  3-1 lead as frustration began to mount in her less experienced  opponent. 
In the third set, Halep broke at love for a 3-2 lead and hung on to  claim her 37th victory of the year despite producing 10 double faults  and putting fewer than 60 per cent of her first serves into play.
In the other semi-final, Haddad Maia broke the big-serving Czech to open the match and produced two excellent first serves to capture the first set. 
Pliskova responded with more aggressive play in the second set,  which resulted in a 5-2 lead but Haddad Maia weathered the storm and  battled back to force a tiebreak. 
In the breaker, Pliskova saved one match point but failed to  convert her set point opportunity and double faulted to end the  hard-fought affair. 
The unseeded Haddad Maia has defeated local favorite Leylah  Fernandez, world number one Iga Swiatek and Tokyo Olympics gold medalist  Belinda Bencic en route to her first WTA 1000 event final. 
Haddad Maia beat Halep in the semifinals of the Birmingham Classic  earlier this year, a tournament she went on to win for her lone WTA  title.
