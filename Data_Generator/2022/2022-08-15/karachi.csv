1,"Govt failure to increase special courts delay 5,000 drugs cases trials",The hold-up results in destruction of evidence leading to acquittal of accused...,"KARACHI: Trials of over 5,000 drug-related cases hit a snag as the federal government has failed to increase the number of special courts in the metropolis to try the suspects and punish the convicts booked under the anti-narcotics law, it has emerged.  
Well-placed sources told Dawn that more than 5,000 drugs cases were recently transferred from the two Special (Control of Narcotic Substance - CNS) Courts to 12 Model Criminal Trial Courts (MCTCs) functioning in Karachi.
In Sindh, there are only two special CNS courts established in Karachi, which were supposed to decide hundreds of drugs-related cases filed by the federal and provincial law enforcement agencies all over the province.  
In order to lessen the burden of workload on the CNS courts, the sources said, the Sindh High Court Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M Sheikh had in March this year ordered transfer of those cases from the CNS courts, which had been filed by the provincial law enforcement agencies, including the Sindh police and the excise police. Therefore, more than 5,000 cases (around 2,600 each from the CNS-I and II) were transferred to the 12 Model Criminal Trial Courts — two each functioning in South, East, West, Central, Korangi and Malir districts — over the period of three months under the directives of the high court.  

The hold-up results in destruction of evidence leading to acquittal of accused

“At the moment there are hardly 800 cases left with the CNS-I and II which are originally mandated to entertain only the cases filed by federal agencies — the Anti-Narcotics Force, the Pakistan Customs, the Pakistan Coast Guards and the Pakistan Railways”, the judicial staffers told Dawn.  
But, the sources said that the transfer of over 5,000 cases from the CNS courts had put an extra burden on judges of the MCTCs, which had been preoccupied with extra cases.  
Sessions’ courts overburdened 
“The model courts have received an average 500 extra cases each in addition to a large number of cases already assigned to them,” said the judicial sources requesting anonymity.  
Therefore, the judicial sources said that SHC CJ Shaikh had recommended to the federal government to delegate special powers to at least 12 more courts in the metropolis to decide the recently transferred drugs-related cases under the CNS Act, 1997.  
The judicial and prosecution sources said that the federal government had yet to decide the provincial top judge’s recommendation primarily because of the change in the mechanism for the appointment of judges/delegation of special powers to the ordinary sessions’ courts following a judgment rendered by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the Mustafa Impex Case back in 2016.  
“Earlier, the Prime Minister and Chief Minister(s) concerned were the sole authority to approve summaries moved by either by the federal law ministry or provincial law department(s) seeking establishment of new courts or conferring special powers to the existing ordinary sessions’ courts”, said the sources.  
“However, following the apex court’s judgment the federal and provincial cabinets, including the Prime Minister, the Chief Ministers and Ministers, would jointly deliberate upon and decide such summaries seeking establishment of new courts/conferment of special powers to the existing ordinary sessions’ courts to decide the cases lodged under the special laws such as the CNS Act, Anti-Terrorism Act etc”. 
Delayed trial benefit accused 
The lawyers opined that the trials were stalled for the last three months causing problems for the suspects booked in these cases.  
“In the first place, this is a violation of the fundamental rights of speedy trial of every suspect(s)”, they said.  
Secondly, they said that such delays would ultimately benefit the accused persons, as it results in non-recording and destruction of the crucial evidence — both material as well as the testimonies of the witnesses — resulting in their acquittal.  
“This would ruin the whole concept of conducting swift trials to punish the accused involved in the dirty business of drugs”, added the lawyers.

2,Ex-lawmaker among 17 held as police thwart MQM-L protest in Karachi,"Former MPA Nisar Panhwar, others arrested for holding demonstration outside Karachi Press Club for release of missing persons.","KARACHI: Seventeen activists of the Altaf Hussain-led Muttahida Qaumi Movement were arrested after they, along with scores of women and children, tried to hold a demonstration outside the Karachi Press Club for release of missing persons.
Saddar SP Ali Mardan said that former MPA Nisar Panhwar and 16 others were arrested and booked under Section 147 (rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) and 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Artillery Maidan police station.
Requesting anonymity, another police officer told Dawn the protesters carrying portraits of MQM founder Altaf Hussain raised slogans in his favour and delivered “provocative” speeches. “Since [carrying] pictures of Altaf Hussain is banned, the area police took into custody 17 persons and lodged an FIR against them,” he said.
Earlier, witnesses said that scores of MQM-L workers and supporters, carrying national flags and placards converged outside the Karachi Press Club. They were led by former lawmaker Nisar Panhwar and seasoned politician Momin Khan Momin.
The protesters chanted slogans like ‘Long live Pakistan, Long Live Pakistan Army and Sindh Rangers’, ‘Consider Mohajirs as Pakistani as well!’, ‘Give us an opportunity to celebrate Independence Day!’, ‘End ban on our Quaid!’, ‘Remove restrictions and open the gates of Nine Zero!’, etc.
“We want to tell the institutions that we have given sacrifices for the country,” said speakers, adding: “We have never spoken against the institutions as we respect all institutions of Pakistan.”
They demanded that they be ‘forgiven’ like former president Asif Zardari and former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Imran Khan.
However, a heavy contingent of police deployed around press club took into custody many protesters.
Meanwhile, the coordination committee of the MQM-London said in a statement said that the MQM was not allowed to hold a ‘peaceful’ protest on the occasion of Independence Day.
Terming the police action against protesters ‘double standard’, the party said those who used foul language against Pakistan Army and national institutions were allowed to hold rallies while MQM-L workers despite carrying national flags were not allowed to hold ‘peaceful’ demonstrations. The party demanded immediate release of the held workers.
Protest in Hyderabad
A fairly large number of women, men and children gathered outside the local press club to hold a demonstration for the recovery of missing persons.
The supporters carried placards and chanted slogans in favour of Altaf Hussain. They carried national flag as well as party flags. They left the scene after a few minutes of activity Police and Rangers were present there but they did not chase the protesters.

3,Over 50 hurt in celebratory gunfire in Karachi,Several of those injured are said to be in critical condition.,"KARACHI: Over 50 people, including women and children, were wounded in different parts of the metropolis as a result of firing guns into the air in celebration on the eve of Independence Day, police said on Sunday.

4,Two candidates contest appointment of Dr Iraqi as KU vice chancellor,Raise allegations against search committee; apex court refers back petition against KU VC hiring process to SHC...,"KARACHI: The controversy over the selection process of the vice chancellor of the University of Karachi is not yet over as two senior professors, who had been rejected for the post, have approached the Sindh chief minister asking him to cancel the findings of a search committee and hold interviews again “with full transparency”. 
Prof Dr Moonis Ahmar and Prof Dr Jamil H. Kazmi wrote a letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, to the chief minister and contested the appointment of Prof Khalid Mehmood Iraqi as KU vice chancellor alleging that the search committee that interviewed the candidates on June 16 was “totally biased, hostile and favoured him”. 
“Furthermore, there is a conflict of interest between the head of the search committee [Dr Tariq Rafi] and Dr Iraqi because he co-authored two articles in research journals with Dr Iraqi and his wife is doing PhD in the genetics department, which questioned his neutrality,” the July 31 letter says. 
Prof Ahmar and Prof Kazmi along with Prof Iraqi were shortlisted for the post of KU VC by the search committee last month. 

Raise allegations against search committee; apex court refers back petition against KU VC hiring process to SHC

Their letter also refers to the Jan 26 order of the Sindh High Court according to which the government officials concerned were required to upload the video recording of the candidates’ interviews. “To the best of knowledge of the undersigned, the in-camera video hasn’t been uploaded on the website of the government of Sindh. We demand that the in-camera video should be uploaded on the website of the government of Sindh and also shared in the court of law.” 
It alleges mala fide intentions in the manner interviews were conducted and numbers were given to the candidates. 
“Kindly note that both of us worked as Meritorious Professors in B-22 and our academic credentials, apart from administrative and teaching experience also include foreign post-doctoral research, research projects and research publications in renowned international journals. 
“Kindly note that Dr Khalid Iraqi is not a Meritorious Professor and twice rejected by the selection board. Furthermore, we should be told why we were not selected for the post of vice chancellor,” the letter says. 
When contacted, Dr Tariq Rafi, also the chairman of Sindh Higher Education Commission (SHEC), denied the allegations raised by the teachers, contending that the search committee comprised five individuals, two of them senior bureaucrats, who independently ranked the candidates. 
“Even, if my marks [given to Dr Iraqi] were taken out of the whole process, he would still rank higher than other candidates as he received greater numbers from other committee members as well,” he said.
About the in-camera recording of the interviews, he said that he would contact the official concerned to get it uploaded on the government’s website. 
“My wife got enrolled for the doctoral studies eight years back and it’s completely absurd to say this influenced the selection process now in any way,” he said, adding that the co-authored papers were published when he was heading the Jinnah Sindh Medical University and not the provincial HEC. 
About the twice rejection in the selection board, KU vice chancellor Prof Iraqi clarified that he applied for Meritorious Professorship only once. “It was, perhaps, in 2016. I wasn’t shortlisted.” 
Meanwhile, in a related development, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court has sent back the petition filed against the procedure of appointment of KU vice chancellor to the Sindh High Court and directed that the top court of the province should take a decision after examining all the facts. 
Last month, the chief minister had appointed Prof Iraqi as KU vice chancellor for a term of four years. 
The selection process had remained controversial since the post was advertised in May 2019.

5,Vet team on way to Karachi for treatment of four elephants,The main concern is the root canal procedure of 17-year-old Noor Jehan and 16-year-old Madhubala.,"KARACHI: Vets from the global animal welfare organisation Four Paws are on their way to Karachi for the medical treatment of four female African elephants, two of whom are at Karachi Zoo and two in Safari Park. Their main concern, however, is the root canal procedure of 17-year-old Noor Jehan and 16-year-old Madhubala, the two pachyderms at the Karachi Zoo.
For the root canal procedure, the vets are bringing specially-designed, large-sized excavators, drills, endodontic burs and other dental instruments. The tusk infection in both the animals is stated to have reached an alarming stage and they are in constant pain. 
The mission is taking place in response to a Sindh High Court’s May 2022 order that allowed two identical petitions by the Pakistan Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), a local organisation for the welfare and well-being of the animals, and a citizen Owais Awan calling for medical care of the elephants which are stated to be in poor condition due to prolonged neglect.
Four Paws’ vets had earlier visited the animals in the last week of November 2021 and after collecting blood samples and tests, they had submitted a number of recommendations in the SHC regarding better enabling environment, food, medical care and training etc. 
However, this time, the petitioners sought the court’s permission to allow the vets to return and perform medical treatment as according to the counsel for the petitioners, Abbas Leghari, the KMC lacked expertise to implement those recommendations. 
The Four Paws team comprises Dr Marina Ivanova, Dr Frank Goritz, Dr Thomas Hilderbrandt, Four Paws CEO Josef Pfabigan, Director Dr Amir Khalil, elephant trainer Mathias Otto and his assistant Agnieszka. 
Dr Khalil, Dr Ivanova, Dr Hilderbrandt and Dr Goritz were part of the mission that visited in 2021 and performed tests and collected blood and urine samples of the elephants. 
About Noor Jehan and Madhubala, Dr Frank, the team lead, had observed in the report that the damaged and infected tusks needed to be removed as soon as possible otherwise the tooth infection will prove to be fatal for the animals. He added that the elephants at the zoo had severe dental problems, which are both “painful” and “life-threatening”.
According to Dr Khalil, it is going to be a unique operation unheard of, as removal of the elephant’s infected tusk requires quite large instruments, special procedure and care.
“We are coming as a big team this time as it is a very important and unique operation to be performed by internationally-recognised vets of Four Paws,” he said.
“The surgery, which is complicated, needs a specialised team and special equipment,” he added.
The report also disclosed and the SHC referred it in its May 2022 order that the two elephants at the Safari Park were also facing foot problems like cracked nails, overgrown foot pads, overgrown and mala-formed nails and an abscess. 
One of the two elephants at Safari Park, Sonu, earlier considered a male, also turned out to be female. Interestingly, the zoo vets, despite having them for over a decade at the Safari Park, were not aware of the gender of Sonu (now Sonia), and even after the ultrasound test performed by vets, insisted that she was a male elephant. 
She and her companion Malika were brought from Tanzania in 2009 and since then, it is believed, that no vet had gone near them.

7,This week 50 years ago: Independence Day celebrations and flats for jhuggi dwellers,THE nation celebrated its 25th Independence Day with the patriotic fervour. But an event held in the city in that...,"THE nation celebrated its 25th Independence Day with the patriotic fervour. But an event held in the city in that connection didn’t get the kind of response from the media that its organisers might have expected. On Aug 16, 1972 a report in Dawn claimed that a mixed bag of music and entertainment was arranged by the Arts Council and Karachi’s Radio and Television stations to mark Independence Day. The council ‘surprisingly’ did well by coming up a highly enjoyable concert by Farida Khanum and two good plays produced by Ali Ahmad. The programmes presented by Karachi TV and Radio were, however, ‘dull on the whole’. 
Khanum captivated an appreciative audience by singing in her inimitable style. She sang from a wide repertoire of Urdu ghazal, geet, Punjabi folk songs and light classical pieces winning instant applause for her performance. The ‘leading avant-garde’ producer, Ali Ahmed, selected a story Surkh Feeta written by Qudratullah Shahab to highlight the faults and failures of the bureaucracy. His adaptation of a beautiful Balochi folk tale Roshni, too, proved of contemporary interest for its immediacy and treatment of present-day problems in society. The 16-hour TV marathon, though, ‘did not justify the expense it must have entailed in preparation and presentation’. 
In a related story, on Aug 14, a troupe of Pakistani folk singers and dancers left Karachi for Kenya, Tanzania and Mauritius. Led by Salim Gilani, it consisted of Ustad Hamid Husain, Suraiya Multanikar, Khameeso Khan, Muneer Sarhadi, Mureed Buledi, Mehdi Hasan, Tufail Niazi, Ustad Shaukat Husain, Bilqis Khanum, Samina Khanum, Sadiq Husain and Talib and Husain. The celebrated singer Reshma was conspicuous by her absence. The troupe on its 15-day tour was to land first in Mauritius. 
While the cultural facet of the city looked good, on the civic front things did not cut a rosy picture. On Aug 16, about 3,000 people were rendered homeless when the demolition squad of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA) razed to the ground 554 huts in Qasba Colony. Assisted by the police, it finished the operation in two hours. Colony residents said some of them had been living there for the last eight years. They alleged that the demolition was carried out without any prior notice. 
The next day, on Aug 17, Provincial Minister for Local Bodies Jam Sadiq Ali at a meeting with residents of Jacob Lines announced that multi-storey flats would be built for permanent rehabilitation of the jhuggi-dwellers at Jacob Lines, Jut Lines, Bizerta Lines, Tunisia Lines and Abyssinia Lines. He was accompanied by Kamal Azfar, provincial finance minister. He added that the entire land spread over 700 acres was being transferred from the cantonment board to the provincial government under the instructions of President Z A Bhutto to facilitate construction of flats at suitable sites in those areas. 
Lifestyle issues, such as the ones mentioned above, often cause health problems. On Aug 20, a study conducted by the Skin and Social Hygiene Centre revealed that prevalence of infectious skin diseases among the child population of the city was extremely high. About 73 per cent of children below the age of 12 had fallen victim to various dermatological ailments. Over 36 per cent of them brought to the centre were suffering from scabies — a parasitic disease caused by itch mites. Experts said, though scabies was endemic in Karachi, its incidence was the highest during the winter.

More than 50 activists appeared at the Larkana Press Club and 20 others at the Dadu Press Club to celebrate the 75th Independence Day of Pakistan and announce their decision to quit nationalism. They were carrying national flag to show their loyalty to the country and raising slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad’. 
Speaking to the media at the Larkana Press Club, JSQM activists Darya Khan Mastoi and Azad Jarwar, along with other activists of different nationalist groups including Manthar Chandio, Sajid Rind, Mujahid Markhand, Masqood Khokhar, Muhktiar Almani, Sono Jatoi, Rasool Bakhsh Dero and Shakeel Soomro, said nationalist forces had been using them and other people of Sindh, particularly youth, for their ulterior motives in the name of ‘rights’. 
They said such forces were actually following the agenda of Pakistan’s enemies and using their workers for subversive activities.
They said these parties and groups were exploiting peaceful people of Sindh for achieving their own hidden interests while most of their leaders were enjoying luxurious life abroad. 
“They instigate youth against Pakistan and the army through negative propaganda,” they said, adding: “We wasted our time by remaining with them for long.” 
They said they had now realised that “Pakistan is the country that has given us rights, identity and respect”. 
They appealed to youth to focus on education and play their positive role for peace in Pakistan and progress of the country. 
“We are one nation and that is Pakistani,” they said, adding that they would also assure the country’s law enforcing agencies that they would remain loyal to the country in future and use their energy and strength for Pakistan.
DADU: Similar statements were given by a group of 20 JSQM activists that came to the Dadu Press Club to announce their decision to quit nationalist politics.
“We have resigned from the basic membership of JSQM to switch over to mainstream parties and quit nationalist politics,” they said.
They waved the national flags they had brought with them and raised the slogan of ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ The group was led by Nisar Chandio.

The same situation prevailed in district Ghotki where main roads and ways remained under the rainwater as life activities were disturbed because of power supply suspension during the night and Sunday morning.  
MIRPURKHAS: As intermittent rains continued in the city and other towns of the district on Sunday, main roads and streets were inundated with rainwater while Jashane Azadai rallies also faced hardship due to standing rainwater.  
Low-lying areas were submerged while the relevant government department had failed to drain out the water which resulted in great many hardships to citizens.  
Owing to stagnant rainwater deep ditches had developed on main roads and streets at different places causing serious problems to vehicles and bike riders. Residents of various low-lying colonies shifted to safer places and at houses of their relatives as the rainwater had entered their houses.  
Cleanliness conditions were filthy as heaps of garbage had been lying at different places in streets and roads creating hazardous atmosphere.  
Religious, social organisations and civil society urged higher authorities to take immediate notice of the bad condition of the city and ensure immediate draining out of the rainwater.

12,Sindh lagged behind as 72pc women’s abilities remained unutilised: expert,HYDERABAD: Renowned economist and researcher Dr Ishrat Hussain has said that per capita production in Sindh was not...,"HYDERABAD: Renowned economist and researcher Dr Ishrat Hussain has said that per capita production in Sindh was not satisfactory and emphasised the need for restore economic and business links between people of cities and villages for faster development in the country. He called for enhancement of budget and said royalty should be given to scientists for their inventions.
He was chairing a talk and course workshop of his book, The economy of modern Sindh at Sindh Agriculture University (SAU), Tandojam, on Saturday. 
Dr Hussain said that after independence, Pakistan did not make great progress economically and now practically we have to play a role.
He said that unfortunately, 72pc of women in Sindh, unlike other provinces, were away from productive activities and labour force due to which society was facing poverty and illiteracy. 
He said that marketing the produce and agricultural by-products from rural areas and organic and cultural goods in cities would bring prosperity to the people of rural areas and by creating their buying power we could enable them to have the goods produced by the industrial sector in cities.
He said that the main reason for greater development in Bengal [now Bangladesh] was that they enabled more than 50pc of population of women and included them in labour force for development. Without involving women in productive activity, no change could be brought about. 
He said students, researchers and teachers would get great help from the data, mentioned in this book while many problems and their solutions were highlighted in the book.
SAU vice chancellor Dr Fateh Marri said the university was working on indigenous breeds of animals, quality seeds of crops, higher yield of fruits and vegetables. He said the institution was promoting research on water-scarce and arid farming. Vice Chancellor of the University of Sufism and Modern Sciences, Bhit Shah, Dr Parveen Munshi said that women could play an important role in development and there was a need for contributing to this sector at national and provincial level. A large number of women would have to be inducted into labour force, she added.
Educationist Prof Aijaz Hussain Qureshi said that per capita income and productivity were needed to be increased. He said Sindh has great potential in the agriculture, industry and services sectors.
Dr Mohammad Ismail Kumbhar, Dr Aijaz Soomro, Dr Abdullah Arijo, Dr Tehmina Nagraj, Nida Asad Marri and others also spoke.
Prof Dr Aijaz Khooharo, Parvez Bhanbhan, Mir Mohammad Khokhar, Dr Shahab Mughal, Dr Shuja Mehesar, Syed Ghiyasuddin Shah Rashidi, Prof Dr Inayatullah Rajpar, Dr Manzoor Abro, Dr Bachal Bhutto, Dr Ziaul Hassan Shah and Dr Jam Ghulam Murtaza, besides teachers and students from SAU, Sindh University, Government College University (Hyderabad), attended the event.
