• Prays for liberation of occupied Kashmir, Palestine
ISLAMABAD: Pledging to strive hard to pull the country out of the economic crisis, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday predicted defeat for those spreading disappointment and despondency and said his government in collaboration with the armed forces will foil the enemies’ designs.
“We will shed last drop of our blood for the country and those spreading disappointment will face defeat again. With the help of armed forces, we will crush enemies’ designs,” he said while addressing a flag-hoisting ceremony held to mark the Independence Day. In his speech, the PM touched on different issues from freedom movement to the country’s role at the world level and from floods to Kashmir dispute.
Like yesterday, PM Shehbaz on Sunday as well stressed the need for a national dialogue for addressing the country’s economic woes.
“The time has come for holding the national dialogue and developing a consensus on a charter of economy by all the stakeholders to transform Pakistan into an economic power,” he added.
The PM also witnessed playing of the re-recorded national anthem at the Jinnah Convention Centre. 
“If we can become a nuclear power, we can also become an economic power but for this we have to strive day and night and prove to the world that we are not inferior to anyone,” he said. 
“Pakistan Movement is a lesson for everyone which tells when a nation devised the course of its path, the mountain-like hurdles and sea-like distances could not hamper them from achieving their goal.” 
The prime minister recalled that when Allama Iqbal dreamt of a separate motherland, a sense of pessimism was created that it was not feasible.
“We salute the founding fathers of Pakistan who had smashed such sense of pessimism and due to their historic struggle, we are now breathing in an independent and sovereign country,” he added.
Mr Sharif said that for decades, the Muslims in the sub-continent faced foreign subjugation, they laid down their lives, gave immense sacrifices and made a historic migration and lost their near and dear ones in that perilous journey to achieve a separate country.
He said creation of Pakistan was a sacred trust and mission, the first phase of which was completed, but its second phase was still incomplete. 
“The mission is to give practical shape to those ideals which were reflected in the March 23 Resolution.”
The premier recalled that on its independence, Pakistan was deprived of its due share, but despite all those odds it made excellent progress in different fields as being the 7th in the world and 1st nuclear power of the Muslim world.
Late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto started the nuc­lear programme and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif realised it, he maintained. He pointed out that Pakistan had been playing a key role in the UN peacekeeping missions in various parts of the world.
He underlined the need for retrospection and reflection on the country’s history by rectifying the mistakes.
Mr Sharif also lauded the contributions made by the Pakistani expatriates in the development and prosperity of the country.
He prayed for the liberation of India-held Kashmir and Occupied Palestine from the illegal foreign occupation.
Expressing grief and sorrow over losses in recent floods, he said rains had caused destruction and huge losses in different parts of the country, especially Balochistan, as hundreds had lost their lives and children were left orphans. He prayed for the early recovery of the injured.
The prime minister said on this day the nation also acknowledged the contributions of civil society members like the late Abdul Sattar Edhi and Dr Ruth Pfau. 
He highlighted the minorities’ role in Pakistan Movement and appreciated their sacrifices. He recalled that Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had stressed on religious freedom in the newly created Pakistan.
He said the government accorded high priority to realise the true potential of the country’s youth and expressed the optimism that the youth would steer the future course of country’s progress and prosperity by following the Quaid’s principles of unity and discipline.
He urged them to accomplish the mission of the country’s forefathers by discarding the begging bowl.
The prime minister expressed pleasure that the national anthem had been re-recorded after 68 years and appreciated efforts of the ministry of information, ISPR and others in this regard.
Later, PM Sharif visited Pakistan Sweet Home, an orphanage, where he celebrated Independence Day with children.

2,Protesters booked for sloganeering against security forces in Swat's Khwazakhela,"Police have not revealed details of FIR; civil society members express concern over police action, term it ""unjust and illegal"".","SWAT: The police on Saturday lodged an FIR against some of the participants of the Khwazakhela ‘peace protest’ for allegedly chanting slogans against the security forces.
According to Swat District Police Officer Zahid Nawaz Marwat, the FIR was lodged as some of the participants chanted slogans against security forces and tried to defame the state institutions. 
They also abused state institutions, the DPO clai­med, adding “those who defame state institutions will be dealt with as per law”.
The DPO did not reveal details of the FIR, saying he was in the field taking part in the operation launched against the “militants” in the area.
On Saturday, the Inter-Services Public Relations rejected as baseless the reports about TTP running amok in Swat. It, however, said that presence of “small number of armed men on few mountain-tops between Swat and Dir has been observed”, located far away from population. “Appa­rently, these individuals sneaked in from Afgha­nistan to resettle in their native areas. A close watch is being maintained on their limited presence and movement in mountains,” the ISPR said.
According to family members of those nominated in the FIR, the case was registered under Sections 16 of MPO, and Sections 504, 506, 149A, 124A, 124B, etc of Pakistan Penal Code.
Meanwhile, civil society members expressed concern over the police action, terming it an “unjust and illegal move”.
They recalled that on Aug 8 a large number of people took to the streets against the recent appearance of militants in the mountains of Matta tehsil, bordering Swat and Dir districts.
“Recently a video was released by unidentified persons on social media showing a man claiming to be a Talib militant and interviewing the Matta circle DSP Pir Syed and two security officers. After which the police issued a statement acknowledging that the Matta circle DSP was injured by the firing of some militants in Kanala mountains of Matta tehsil,” said Khurshaid Kaka Ji, a spokesperson for the Swat Qaumi Jirga. He added that in reaction to the developments thousands of people of Swat staged a rally condemning the appearance of militants.
He said people of Swat, who had been badly affected by years of militancy, would not allow anyone to sabotage the hard-earned peace. 
He regretted that police had lodged an FIR against Ghairat Yousafzai, a student, and some other participants of the rally. He alleged that the police were not showing the FIR to the family members of the victims.
Lawyers also voiced concern over the police action. “The Constitution of Pakistan allows its citizens the rights of expressing their opinion, holding meetings and processions, and the rights to speak and write,” said Karim Shilmani advocate. 
He said people were upset over the reappearance of militants and expressed their anger in peaceful protests.
The civil society members cautioned that lodging an FIR against peaceful protesters would incite people against the police.
The situation is normal across Swat. People said police and security forces were present in the mountains of Matta tehsil but they heard no sound of gunshots.

Floods in Balochistan
Several districts of Balochis­tan remained submerged due to floods leaving hundreds of people stranded in the Kohlu, Lehri, and Barkhan districts of the province.
Officials said Kohlu received heavy rains throughout Saturday night which flooded a major part of the district, forcing scores of people to leave their homes as the floodwater entered many villages and destroyed their houses made of mud. Seasonal rivers in Kohlu overflowed which washed away several roads disconnecting dozens of villages with the district headquarters.
