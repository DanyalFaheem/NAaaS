Nusantara, which is 2,000 kilometres (1,200 miles) from Jakarta, is set to become the new political centre of the world’s fourth-largest country.
It is a legacy project of President Joko Widodo but environmentalists have warned it could accelerate the destruction of tropical jungles home to long-nosed monkeys and orangutans.
The government is preparing to ramp up infrastructure projects to open the doors to the city — which will cover about 56,180 hectares (216 square miles) on Borneo island — by the time Widodo leaves office in 2024.
“The main point (of the ceremony) is to take the spirit of the 77th Independence Day to strengthen our resolve and spirit to build the new capital,” said State Capital Authority head Bambang Susantono, who will govern the new city.
After the national flag was hoisted by officials to mark the occasion, workers at the site cheered in unison that they were  “ready to develop Nusantara”, which means archipelago in Indonesian.
Jakarta is home to 30 million people in its greater metro area and it has long been plagued by serious infrastructure problems and flooding exacerbated by climate change.
It is sinking as much as 25 centimetres (10 inches) a year in some areas — double the global average for major coastal cities — with some experts predicting up to a third of the megalopolis could be underwater by 2050.
Government officials say the new capital will take decades to be fully completed and inhabited by its planned population of two million people and will help spread economic growth to an underdeveloped region.

1,Iraqi leaders agree on political roadmap,BAGHDAD: Iraq’s main political leaders — but not firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr — agreed on Wednesday to work ...,"BAGHDAD: Iraq’s main political leaders — but not firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr — agreed on Wednesday to work on a roadmap aimed at ending the country’s political impasse, after talks called by the premier.
They also pledged to keep talking, and urged Sadr to join what Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi called the  “national dialogue”.
Ten months after a general election last October, war-scarred Iraq still has no government, new prime minister or new president, because of disagreement over forming a coalition.
Tensions have been rising since July between the two main Shia factions, one led by Sadr, the other by the pro-Iran Coordination Framework. Attempts to mediate have so far proved fruitless.
Sadr wants parliament dissolved to pave the way for new elections, but the Coordination Framework wants to set conditions and demands a transitional government before new polls.

2,Top Republican Trump critic Cheney loses seat in US Congress,Vows to fight on and do “whatever it takes” to ensure that former president Donald Trump is never returned to power.,"JACKSON: Republican rebel Liz Cheney lost her seat in Congress on Tuesday to an election conspiracy theorist, but vowed to fight on and do  “whatever it takes” to ensure that former president Donald Trump is never returned to power.
Once considered Republican royalty, the lawmaker from Wyoming has become a pariah in the party over her membership on the congressional panel investigating the January 6 assault on the US Capitol — and Trump’s role in fanning the flames.
“I have said since January 6 that I will do whatever it takes to ensure Donald Trump is never again anywhere near the Oval Office, and I mean it,” the Wyoming congresswoman said in a concession speech after losing her bid at reelection.
Defeat for the 56-year-old daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney in the Wyoming Republican primary marks the end of the family’s four-decade political association with one of America’s most conservative states.
The Republican nomination to contest November’s midterms instead goes to 59-year-old lawyer Harriet Hageman — Trump’s hand-picked candidate who has amplified his false claims of a  “rigged” 2020 election.
In her speech on Tuesday night, Cheney delivered a stark warning about the danger of Trump’s election fraud conspiracy theories, urging politicians on both sides of the aisle to join her fight to protect US democracy.
Speaking at a cattle ranch near Jackson, Cheney sought to move quickly beyond her defeat, setting out what she said was  “real work” of her effort to ensure Trump never regains the White House.
She blamed the former president, who is embroiled in numerous criminal and civil investigations over alleged misconduct in office, for sending the deeply-divided United States towards  “crisis, lawlessness and violence” with his inflammatory rhetoric.
“No American should support election deniers, for any position of genuine responsibility, (because) their refusal to follow the rule of law will corrupt our future,” she warned.
There is already speculation that Cheney may challenge Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 — or even run as an independent — and supporters were hoping her concession speech would double up as a blueprint for her political future.
She pointedly avoided addressing the issue, but had earlier told CBS that the primary — regardless of the result — would be  “the beginning of a battle that is going to continue.”  “We are facing a moment where our democracy really is under 
attack and under threat,” she said.
Cheney had framed her campaign as a battle for the soul of a party she is trying to save from the anti-constitutional forces of Trumpism. She was the last of 10 Republicans in the House of Representatives who backed Trump’s second impeachment to face primary voters.
Four retired rather than seek reelection, three lost to Trump-backed opponents, and only two — California’s David Valadao and Dan Newhouse of Washington state — have made it through to November’s midterm elections.
Cheney voted in line with Trump’s positions 93 percent of the time when he was president but he didn’t pull his punches as he sought vengeance for her role in the House committee probe. Trump has made Cheney his bete noire, calling her  “disloyal” and a  “warmonger,” prompting death threats that have forced her to travel with a police escort.
He called her defeat Tuesday night  “a wonderful result for America.”  “Now she can finally disappear into the depths of political oblivion where, I am sure, she will be much happier than she is right now,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.
During the lead-up to Tuesday’s vote in Wyoming — the first US state to grant women the right to vote, in 1869 — the congresswoman was forced to run a kind of shadow campaign, with no rallies or public events.
She even avoided the traditional election day photo op Tuesday, eschewing media at her local polling station to instead cast her ballot in nearby Jackson.
“Liz is representing the constituents that are in her mind, and they aren’t the constituents of Wyoming,” said Mary Martin, chairwoman of the Republican Party in Teton County — Cheney’s Wyoming base.

3,"Taliban test repaired planes, helicopters","Defence ministry says it recently repaired 35 tanks, 15 Humvee armoured vehicles and 20 US-produced Navistar 7000 military vehicles.","KABUL: Taliban military aircraft roared over the Afghan capital on Wednesday as the group’s defence ministry tested out recently repaired hardware, much of it left behind by foreign militaries and acquired since the Taliban seized power a year ago.
Aircraft, including helicopters and at least one plane, flew low over Kabul skies near the airport, including what appeared to be at least one Russian-made MI-24 attack helicopter and two other American-made aircraft.
A defence ministry spokesperson, Enayatullah Khowarazmi, said the Taliban had recently repaired some helicopters and were conducting the flyovers as a test. He did not confirm the exact make or country of origin, saying only that  “all types of aircraft” were being tested.
It was not clear who had provided the technical expertise to repair the helicopters.
Taliban officials have said that pilots, mechanics and other specialists from the former Afghan National Army would be integrated into their security forces.
The defence ministry also said in a statement that its engineering team had recently repaired 35 tanks, 15 Humvee armoured vehicles and 20 US-produced Navistar 7000 military vehicles. All had been damaged as the Taliban took over the country in August 2021, the anniversary of which was marked on Monday with gatherings and gunfire by the hardline Islamist group.
US troops destroyed more than 70 aircraft and dozens of armoured vehicles and disabled air defences before flying out of Kabul’s airport following a chaotic evacuation operation.
Between 2002 and 2017, the United States transferred to the Afghan government over $28 billion worth of defence articles and services, including weapons, ammunition, vehicles, night-vision devices, aircraft, and surveillance systems, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction.

4,"Uproar in Israel, Germany over Palestinian President Abbas’s remarks","During a visit to Berlin, Abbas accused Israel of committing “50 Holocausts”.","BERLIN: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz voiced disgust on Wednesday at remarks by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas that the German leader said diminished the importance of the Holocaust, while Israel accused Abbas of telling a “monstrous lie”.
During a visit to Berlin on Tuesday, Abbas accused Israel of committing “50 Holocausts” in response to a question about the coming 50th anniversary of the attack on the Israeli team at the 1972 Munich Olympics by Palestinians.
“For us Germans in particular, any relativisation of the singularity of the Holocaust is intolerable and unacceptable,” Scholz tweeted on Wednesday. “I am disgusted by the outrageous remarks made by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.”  

 





 
Scholz’s office summoned the head of the Palestinian diplomatic mission in Berlin to protest the remarks by Abbas, a German government spokesperson said.
Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid called the comments a  “disgrace”. Germany’s ZDF television reported that Scholz would speak to Lapid on Thursday to avoid lasting damage to ties. Since the Holocaust and World War Two, German politicians have stressed their special responsibility towards Israel.
“Mahmoud Abbas accusing Israel of having committed ‘50 Holocausts’ while standing on German soil is not only a moral disgrace, but a monstrous lie,” Lapid said on Twitter.
“History will never forgive him.”  

 





 
In response to the outcry, Mahmoud Abbas issued a statement calling the killing of Jews in Germany during World War II “the most heinous crime in modern human history”.
He said his remark on Tuesday was not intended to deny the singularity of the Holocaust but to highlight “the crimes and massacres committed against the Palestinian people since the Nakba at the hands of Israeli forces”.

5,"Israel, Turkiye resume full diplomatic relations",Turkish FM says move should not be interpreted as Ankara ‘giving up on Palestinian cause’,"JERUSALEM: Israel and Turkiye announced the resumption of full diplomatic ties on Wednesday, following years of strained relations between the Mediterranean nations. 
Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid hailed the diplomatic breakthrough as an “important asset for regional stability and very important economic news for the citizens of Israel”. 
Lapid’s office said the diplomatic development will see ambassadors and consuls general posted to the two countries once more. 
The announcement follows months of bilateral efforts to mend ties, with reciprocal visits by top officials. 

Turkish FM says move should not be interpreted as Ankara ‘giving up on Palestinian cause’

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the return of ambassadors “is important to improve bilateral ties”. But he cautioned that closer ties with Israel should not be interpreted as Ankara “giving up on the Palestinian cause”. 
Cavusoglu in May became the first Turkish foreign minister to visit Israel in 15 years, during a trip which also saw him meet the Palestinian leadership in the occupied West Bank. 
During a landmark visit by Israeli President Isaac Herzog to Ankara two months earlier, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan proclaimed their meeting marked “a turning point in our relations”. 
Bilateral relations began to fray in 2008, following an Israeli military operation in Gaza. Relations then froze after the deaths of 10 civilians following an Israeli raid on the Turkish Mavi Marmara ship, part of a flotilla trying to breach a blockade by carrying aid into Gaza in 2010. 
A brief reconciliation lasted from 2016 until 2018, when ambassadors were withdrawn once again over the killing of Palestinians. More than 200 Gazans were shot dead by Israeli forces during border protests from 2018 to 2019. 
‘Defend’ Palestinian rights 
Reconciliation publicly got under way after Herzog took office in July 2021.
The Israeli president on Wednesday said the full renewal of ties “will encourage greater economic relations, mutual tourism, and friendship between the Israeli and Turkish peoples”. 
Despite the diplomatic differences in recent years, trade had continued and Turkey has remained a popular destination for Israeli tourists. 
Israel, however, warned its citizens to return home in June, citing an Iranian assassination plot against its nationals in Istanbul. 
Lapid then thanked Ankara for its cooperation on the issue and Israelis swiftly resumed their Turkish holidays. 
Israel has been wary of upsetting regional allies over its decision to strengthen ties with Turkey, with Herzog dispatched to Cyprus and Greece ahead of his Ankara trip. 
Turkiye has meanwhile been keen to stress that its normalisation with Israel could yield benefits for the Palestinians. “As we have always said, we will continue to defend the rights of Palestinians,” Cavusoglu said on Wednesday. 
As well as its relations with the Palestinian leadership based in the West Bank, Turkiye has also maintained ties with the Islamist group Hamas that rules Gaza.
Efraim Inbar, president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, said observers should be “under no illusion” that bilateral ties will be as good as they were during the 1990s. 
“As long as Erdogan is in power there will be a certain amount of hostility from Turkiye towards Israel, because of his Islamist connection. He will continue to support Hamas for instance,” he said. 
Israel has imposed a blockade on Gaza’s 2.3 million residents since 2007.

Beijing staged days of air and sea drills in the Taiwan Strait this month after visits by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a congressional delegation to the self-ruled island territory.
Taipei has carried out its own drills to simulate defence against invasion by China and on Wednesday air force personnel loaded an F-16V fighter with a US-made anti-ship missile in a  “combat readiness” exercise at an airbase in eastern Hualien county. Six F-16Vs later took off for night reconnaissance and training missions, including two armed with missiles, according to Taiwan’s air force.
“In the face of the threat from Chinese communist forces’ recent military exercises, we have stayed vigilant while establishing 
the concept of ‘battlefields everywhere and training anytime’... to ensure national security,” it said in a statement.
Taiwan lives under constant threat of an invasion by China, which claims the democratically-ruled island as part of its territory to be seized one day, by force if necessary.

7,UK crossbow intruder wanted ‘to kill queen’,LONDON: A man appe­ared in court on Wednesday after allegedly entering Windsor Castle grounds armed with a ...,"LONDON: A man appe­ared in court on Wednesday after allegedly entering Windsor Castle grounds armed with a crossbow, declaring he planned to kill Queen Elizabeth II.
The 20-year-old man, Jaswant Singh Chail, from Southampton in southern England, appeared at a London court, having been charged with treason earlier this month.
He appeared at Westm­inster Magistrates’ Court via video-link from Broa­dmoor high-security psychiatric hospital, confirming his name and location.
The prosecution told the court that Chail was held in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where the monarch was staying, early on Christmas Day last year.
Dressed in a hood and mask and carrying a loaded crossbow with the safety catch off, Chail came within line of sight of the Queen’s apartments, prosecutor Kathryn Selby said.
Chail allegedly told a protection officer:  “I am here to kill the Queen.” The most serious charge he faces under the 180-year-old Treason Act is  “intent... to injure the person of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, or to alarm her Majesty”.
In the last such case, Briton Marcus Sarjeant was jailed for five years in 1981 after pleading guilty to firing blank shots at the monarch when she was on parade.

8,Frequent power cuts torment China amid record heatwave,"For more than two months, baking temperatures have disrupted crop growth, threatened livestock and forced industries to shut down.","SHANGHAI: China is scrambling to alleviate power shortages and bring more water to the drought-hit basin of the Yangtze river as it battles a record-breaking heatwave by deploying relief funds, seeding clouds and developing new sources of supply.
For more than two months, baking temperatures have disrupted crop growth, threatened livestock and forced industries in the hydropower-dependent regions of the southwest to shut down so as to ensure electricity supplies for homes.
China has repeatedly warned that it faces a proliferation of extreme weather events in coming years as it tries to adapt to climate change and rises in temperature that are likely to be more severe than elsewhere.
The current extreme heat is likely to stem from a  “special case” of high pressure from a West Pacific subtropical high extending over much of Asia, said Cai Wenju, a researcher with Australia’s national scientific research institute, CSIRO.
On Wednesday, China’s southwestern province of Sichuan said it would ration power supplies to homes, offices and shopping malls, after having already ordered energy-intensive metals and fertiliser producers to curb operations.
In what appears to be an official call to cut back use of electricity, government offices were asked to set air conditioners no lower than 26 degrees Celsius (79 Fahrenheit) and use more staircases instead of lifts, the Sichuan Daily, run by the provincial government, said. Fountains, light shows and commercial activities after dark are to be suspended, it added. 
Power shortages have also prompted several companies in the sprawling Chongqing region bordering Sichuan to say they would suspend production.
Chinese vice premier Han Zheng visited the State Grid Corporation on Wednesday and said further efforts were needed to ensure power supply for residents and key industries, and to prevent power cuts, according to a state media report.
China should accelerate the construction of key projects, improve power load management and promote the joint operation of coal power and renewable energy, Han said.
Hydropower makes up about 80pc of Sichuan’s power capacity, but dwindling water flows on the Yangtze and its tributaries led to a struggle to meet mounting demand for air conditioning as temperatures soared to 40C(104F) and beyond.
Average precipitation in Sichuan is 51pc less than that of previous years, according to state news agency Xinhua, which cited the provincial branch of State Grid.
Some reservoirs have dried up, after water from major rivers reduced by as much as half, it said. Drought throughout the Yangtze river basin was also  “adversely affecting” drinking water for rural people and livestock, as well as the growth of crops, the water resources ministry said in a notice.

The 322-foot-tall (98-metre) rocket is scheduled to embark on its first mission to space — without any humans — on Aug 29. It will be a crucial, long-delayed demonstration trip to the moon for Nasa’s Artemis programme, the United States’ multibillion-
dollar effort to return humans to the lunar surface as practice for future missions to Mars.
The Space Launch System, whose development during the past decade has been led by Boeing Co, emerged from its assembly building at Nasa’s Kennedy Space Centre in Florida about 10pm on Tuesday and began a four-mile (6-kilometre) trek to its launchpad. Moving less than 1mph (1.6kph), the rollout will take roughly 11 hours.
Sitting atop the rocket is Nasa’s Orion astronaut capsule, built by Lockheed Martin Corp. It is designed to separate from the rocket in space, ferry humans towards the moon and rendezvous with a separate spacecraft that will take astronauts to the lunar surface.
For the Aug 29 mission, called Artemis 1, the Orion capsule will launch atop the Space Launch System without any humans and orbit the moon before returning to Earth for an ocean splashdown 42 days later. If bad launch weather or a minor technical issue triggers a delay on Aug. 29, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has backup launch dates on Sept 2 and Sept 5.
