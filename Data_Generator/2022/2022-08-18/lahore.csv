0,Political giants wrangle over transfers ahead of NA-157 by-poll,"Gilanis and the Qureshis raising voice in support and against Multan commissioner, DC and Multan Development Authority head.","LAHORE: The Gilanis and the Qureshis – political giants of Multan – have locked horns over transfer and posting of bureaucrats in the district ahead of a by-poll in National Assembly constituency NA-157 scheduled for Sept 25.  
Both the political opponents are raising voice in support and against the Multan commissioner, deputy commissioner and Multan Development Authority (MDA) head.  
Former prime minister and PPP vice chairman Senator Yusuf Raza Gilani’s son Ali Musa Gilani and former foreign minister and PTI vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi’s daughter Meher Bano Qureshi are contesting for NA-157.  
Mr Qureshi wanted to change Multan Commissioner Aamer Khatak for what he alleged his negative role during the PP-217 by-poll. Mr Qureshi accused the commissioner of supporting his opponents during the PP-217 by-election and had spoken about the issue in different public meetings and press conferences.  
Mr Qureshi alleged that the commissioner was ‘taking orders’ from Yusuf Raza Gilani and his sons during the by-election.
Mr Qureshi had also contacted Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi for transfer of the commissioner who was not transferred first due to Muharram and secondly the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had issued a schedule for the by-election.  
Sources claimed that an adviser to Elahi from Multan also approached him [CM] to stop the transfer of the commissioner as he was in good relations with him.
However, sources claimed that Mr Qureshi and his supporters were trying to get the the Multan commissioner changed and appoint their ‘favourite’ to the post during the NA 157 by-election.
Sources claimed that Mr Qureshi and his son MPA Zain Hussain Qureshi also held a meeting with Commissioner Khatak who was trying to resolve the issue but the duo did not accept his apologies.
The father and son proposed Mr Khatak to get leave from his office during the by-elections.
Sources claimed that Mr Qureshi wanted to give acting charge of the commissioner post to MDA head Saleem Qiaser.
Mr Khatak also filed a leave application for having family commitments with the chief secretary which stated, “I have some family commitments at my village at Nowshera, KP. Therefore, it is requested to kindly allow me earned leave/ station leave from August 5 to September 15, 2022.”
However, the ECP had issued an order to the Punjab government for implementation of the code of conduct regarding posting/ transfer for NA-157 Multan-IV.
Mr Qureshi while addressing a press conference said he had also requested [in the past PP-217 by-elections] that everyone should be given a level-playing field and people should be allowed to decide the fate of the candidates.
He said no bureaucrat should intervene in elections and should play a neutral role.
He said as the election schedule was announced and now no one could be transferred but if anyone had sought leave for personal reasons he should have the right to do so. Meanwhile, former PM Yusuf Raza Gilani told a news conference that the commissioner had filed the leave application due to alleged PTI’s pressure and demanded that the ECP take notice of the matter.
Later, the ECP returning officer also directed the chief secretary not to approve the leave application of the commissioner.  
The ECP also suspended the transfer and posting orders of grade-18 officers in the National Highway Authority on the recommendation of NA-157 returning officer.

4,1.2m people to get cholera vaccination second dose,LAHORE: The Punjab government has earmarked 1.2 million people of the provincial capital for the second dose of...,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has earmarked 1.2 million people of the provincial capital for the second dose of cholera vaccination after the outbreak of the disease hit 17 union councils.  
The epidemic is said to be the outcome of contaminated water use and the public health experts say the underground drinking water has become unsafe for use in most parts of Lahore. 
According to the official figures, 27,000 suspected cases of cholera were reported all over the province during the last month and most of them -- 7,700 -- surfaced in Lahore, raising an alarm for the health department.  
An official said that following the rising number of cases in Punjab and outbreak in Lahore, the Punjab health authorities submitted a request to the federal government to make emergency arrangements of cholera vaccination to avoid the new health crisis. The request was sent on the recommendations of the technical working group on cholera, which was of the view that a target population of 1.2 million in Lahore required emergency vaccination.  
It had conveyed that several patients had to be hospitalised owing to the complications of the ailment and the only remedy was the administration of the vaccination which was not available due to its shortage. He said Lahore was the third city of the country after Karachi and Dera Bugti of Balochistan where the cholera outbreak had been reported. 
“On the Punjab government’s request, Islamabad provided it 2.2 million doses of cholera vaccine,” he said. He added that the health teams completed 15-day vaccination and two-day catch-up drive by administrating it to 1.2 million target population in Lahore.  
About the efficacy of the vaccination, the official said, its first dose provided 63 per cent and second dose 47 per cent safety for a period of three years against cholera.  
The government figures claimed the health teams accessed over 95 per cent of the target population in the vaccination drive. However, there are some reports that it was less than 85 per cent.  
In order to confirm its true impact and number of target population which got vaccine, the health department would go for a third party assessment, he said.  
While sharing details of the drive, he said the campaign would be concluded in 17 high-risk UCs of Lahore across nine towns in two phases. In the phase-1, he said, oral cholera vaccine was administered to all population of one year and above in the selected UCs. A total of 468 mobile and 62 fixed teams (31 morning and 31 evening) took part in the drive to administer vaccine.  
The second phase would start three months after the completion of the first one, the official said.

5,Gujrat notified as 10th division of Punjab,"New division will consist of three districts — Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad.","GUJRAT: The Punjab government on Wednesday formally notified Gujrat as a 10th division of the province.
Gujrat division will consist of three districts -- Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin and Hafizabad -- as per a notification issued by the senior member Board of Revenue (BoR) after the approval of the Punjab governor. 
The new division has been created by bifurcating the existing Gujranwala division, the largest one comprising six districts, having a total population of around 16 million, said a senior administrative official talking to Dawn. 
He gave credit for the creation of the new division to Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi and MNA Moonis Elahi, who played a vital role in the upgrade of their hometown to divisional headquarters. 
Gujrat Deputy Commissioner Amer Shahzad Kang said a piece of land measuring 73 acres had been identified near Machiana village for the establishment of the divisional headquarters offices and residences of the government employees and officers to be posted here. 
Senior Member Board of Revenue (SMBR) Zahid Aktar Zaman had inspected the site proposed site for the divisional offices three days ago. Mr Zaman, who was also accompanied by Gujranwala Commissioner Mansoor Qadir  was briefed by the DC and other concerned officers about the development plan for the site. 
The proposed site is located near Kunjah and Mandi Bahauddin. However, the road linking Hafizabad with Mandi Bahauddin and Gujrat districts from Maano Chak canal is in a pathetic condition and will have to be repaired or reconstructed to facilitate the commuters. 
Moreover, the site for the divisional headquarters is located in an area where some mega infrastructural development projects are already underway, including Phase II of the industrial estate, Samman-Dinga road project. 
The local administration and land revenue department have also prepared proposals for the creation of two new tehsils out of Gujrat -- Jalalpur Jattan and Kunjah -- which may also be upgraded in near future, says official. Most of the homework for the creation of two new tehsils has already been completed, he says, adding that Jalalpur Jattan may get upgraded first. 
PML-Q Punjab information secretary and former education minister Mian Imran Masood said his party had fulfilled the promise of upgrade of Gujrat district to divisional level that would have far reaching impact on the lives of the people of the entire region. 
A source said Wazirabad tehsil of Gujranwala division may also be given the status of a district, that would be later included in Gujrat division, as Punjab government had ordered the concerned authorities to initiate work in this regard.  
Meanwhile, scores of the Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI)  workers staged a protest demonstration in Hafizabad against the  inclusion of the district into the new division.
The PTI workers also blocked a city road by burning tyres and chanted slogans against the Punjab government’s decision. 
Sources  said the lone MNA from Hafizabad, Shaukat Bhatti of the PTI and some  other party lawmakers raised the issue with the senior party leaders,  expressing concern over the inclusion of Hafizabad district in the new  division. 
They say that Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez  Elahi has been trying to address the concerns of the PTI 
lawmakers from  Hafizabad, assuring them of infrastructural development of their  district.

He said the JI would hold a sit-in in front of the headquarters of all distribution companies in the next phase of the protest movement.  
He said the party would continue fight for the public rights in street, plead their case in courts and put it before parliament. What was the justification of including GST, TV fee and income taxes in the electricity bills, he questioned, saying the government could no longer make the masses pay for the the IMF. He demanded the rulers withdraw free electricity to their own bungalows and rest-houses and collect bills from bureaucracy and government servants instead of charging the masses.  

‘Poisonous liquid’ attack on party protesters

JI Lahore chapter emir Zikrullah Mujahid also spoke.  
During the peaceful protest, someone from inside the Lesco gate threw ‘poisonous liquid’ on the participants, causing eye infections to dozens of people who were later shifted to Ganga Ram Hospital for treatment.

10,Flow in Ravi well under control,"Though India is reported to have released 171,000 cusecs of water in two days, dry bed phenomenon worked in favour of Pakistan.","LAHORE: Despite repeated scare, the river Ravi was flowing at 29,000 cusecs and had a normal look on Wednesday. 
According to the Flood Forecasting Division officials, though India is reported to have released 171,000 cusecs of water in two days, the dry bed phenomenon worked in favour of Pakistan and only 29,000 cusecs arrived at Shahdara on Wednesday.  
In the dry bed, which had been so for decades now, three factors naturally control flood. “Speed of flow drops, massive quantity of water is lost in quenching riverbed’s thirst and duration of water flow increases. It is precisely for this reason, flow in the Ravi at Shahdara is completely normal. To put the flow in context, the bridge on the Ravi at Shahdara is designed for 235,000 cusecs and Wednesday’s flow is a paltry 29,000 cusecs.  
“The department measured 63,000 cusecs at Kot Naina where it enters into the country and more than half of it was lost in the next 160 kilometres by the time it reached Shahdara,” it said.  
“The current panic is not about river water breaking its banks and entering some towns but saving those residing in the riverbanks. The river passage now houses living structures and, even, factories and the district administration is panicking to save them, regardless of the fact how they built houses and factories in the riverbed in the first place. The only solution to deal with the situation is to evacuate these people, not constructing more structures to save them. That is what needs to be done.”  
Meanwhile, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, its head and staff visited the flood-affected areas of Dera Ghazi Khan. On this occasion, the Relief Commissioner Punjab said there was no shortage of funds for the relief operation and rehabilitation of the flood victims. All institutions were working day and night for providing relief. This year, the floodwaters of the river and mountains had broken their previous records and two more days of rain had been predicted, he said.  
He said flood relief camps had been established in the affected areas.

The bazaars and streets of Taunsa city present the view of a flowing river due to the continuous downpour.
Residents were evacuated to safer places by boats by Al Khidmat Foundation. The administration said arrangements are being made for the drainage of rainwater from the city. 
The badly hit areas include Sokarr, Mangrotha, Chitarwata, Wahowah and Littra due to overflowing mountain drains in tehsil Taunsa. 
A resident of Tuman Buzdar, Allah Bakhsh Buzdar, told Dawn such fierce flooding had struck the area back in the 1950s when Drug Lahar (mountain drain) in Fazlah valley sank the top of a berry tree grown on agricultural land in front of his ancestral house. 
The floodwater’s destination is the Indus River. He said that thanks to social media, warning alerts reached every resident and no human loss was reported in Fazlah but it damaged kachies (agricultural land produced due to intruding rocks in the bed of hill torrent). 
The kachies along the route of Drug Lahar, Nilee, Kutba, Phugla, Chanalah, Lelli, Makha, Rason, Fazlah, Kore and Ganjyaali have lost their major chunks to floodwater. Two cows and 20 goats have been swept away in the flooding from Chanalah and Makha. 
The bed of Drug Lahar is littered with the carcasses of cows, which came from the Drug area of Balochistan. 
The strong current of the flood washed off embankments making kachies more vulnerable. Residents demand the construction of flood channels and check dams and other engineering structures for managing water. An alarming flood in the Vadoor hill torrent has emerged. Up to 145,000 cusec floodwater is flowing towards Dera Ghazi Khan city areas, Loharwala, Samandry, Thatha other human settlements. 
Deputy Commissioner Anwar Baryar told Dawn he was supervising the evacuation of people and their livestock from the suburban areas of Dera Ghazi Khan city. 
He said that following the continuous rains in Sulaiman Range, the flood in the Vadoor mountain drain is very alarming while the flood level is increasing in the Wahowa hill torrent having a flow of 102,000 cusecs. 
On the orders of the commissioner, the breach on 219 Kadira Canal was plugged. The rain has been forecast till Friday.
