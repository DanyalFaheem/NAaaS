0,Senate sees rare unity in debate on petrol prices,PML-N sides with protesting opposition; PPP demands deals with IMF be laid before the house.,"ISLAMABAD: In a rare display of harmony, Senate members from both sides of the aisle on Wednesday rejected the recent hike in fuel prices, with a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz lawmaker saying it is impossible to defend the move, a Pakistan Peoples Party legislator demanding that the agreements reached between the International Monetary Fund and the present coalition government and the previous PTI government be placed before the parliament, and a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmaker criticising the coalition government for not reducing petroleum prices despite a price decline in international markets. 
The first salvo from the treasury side was fired by Senator Irfanul Haq Siddiqui who minced no words in declaring that he agreed with the protesting opposition.
Recalling that the then opposition used to castigate the PTI government over increase in petroleum products, Senator Siddiqui said the POL price hike had the same impact whoever was in the saddle. “It leads to price hike, poverty and hunger,” he said, admitting that the move could not be defended.

PML-N sides with protesting opposition; PPP demands deals with IMF be laid before the house; PTI welcomes proposed voting on matter

While expressing alarm over hike in petroleum prices, PML-N legislator Saadia Abbasi proposed a discussion on the issue, followed by voting to see if the house accepts or disapproves the increase. “It would be hypocrisy with our office and the oath if we fail to discuss people’s sufferings,” she said, pointing out that the PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and former president Asif Ali Zardari had already rejected it.
PPP stalwart and former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani blasted the elite in all major parties for “playing a game with the masses”. He said the agreements reached with the IMF by the previous PTI government and the present government should be placed before the parliament. “The parliament has a right to know who did what,” he remarked. He said the parliament was being kept in dark, because sharing the agreements with the parliament was “not in the interest of elite on both sides”. Economic sovereignty had been mortgaged to the IMF under the agreement, signed by the PTI government, with the fund, he alleged.
Senator Faisal Javed of PTI welcomed the proposal of voting on the issue of petroleum prices and said the recent hike, in case of voting, would be rejected by the entire house with the exception of few. Yet the present government would increase the POL prices in coming days also, he believed. 
Unemployment and prices of essential commodities were rapidly increasing since the ‘imported government’ took over, he said, while calling for immediate dissolution of the National Assembly and holding of fresh elections.
Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, however, said due to imprudent financial policies of the previous government, Pakistan was on the verge of bankruptcy. He said the present government had taken tough decisions, including the one related to petroleum prices, to save the economy but expressed the hope that people would witness relief soon.
Mr Tarar said it was the previous PTI government that signed an agreement with the IMF and committed not to provide subsidies on petroleum prices.
Earlier, Leader of the Opposition Dr Shahzad Waseem criticised the government for not reducing petroleum prices despite a price decline in international markets and stability of the rupee against the US dollar. He said Miftah Ismail was the one to have imposed petroleum levy of Rs30 in 2018 and to increase it to Rs50 in June 2022.
The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) also criticised the increase in prices of petroleum products, with its Senator Ataur Rehman declaring that his party had already rejected the move.

3,"NA speaker puts off joint sitting again, until Sept 22",This is for the second time that the speaker has done so without giving any reason.,"ISLAMABAD: National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf on Wednes­day again put off the joint sitting of parliament scheduled to be held on August 22 (Monday) for a month.
The joint sitting of the two houses of the parliam­ent will now be held on Sept 22, according to an official announcement of the Nat­ional Assembly Secretariat.
This is for the second time that the speaker has done so without giving any reason.
The official notification in this regard says the speaker has delayed the joint sitting exercising his “powers conferred by proviso to Rule 4 of the Parliament (Joint Sittings) Rules 1973”.
The said rule states: “The speaker shall determine when a joint sitting shall be adjourned sine die or to a particular day, or to an hour of the same day: provided that the speaker may, if he thinks fit, call a joint sitting before the date or time to which it has been adjourned or at any time after the joint sitting has been adjourned sine die.”
The last joint sitting of the parliament was held on June 9 in which the government had managed to get passed “controversial” electoral reforms and the accountability laws after President Dr Arif Alvi refused to give his assent to both laws despite their passage by the National Assembly and the Senate.
The amendments to the Elections Act, 2017, sought to bar the use of electronic voting machines in the next general elections and those to the National Accountability Bureau (Amendment) Act were aimed at preventing the misuse of law for political engineering and victimisation of political opponents. 
The bills had been forwarded to the president for his assent after their passage from the upper and lower houses, but President Alvi sent them back to parliament for reconsideration. The bills were presented to the president again, but he refused to sign them. Subsequently, the bills became an act of parliament after 10 days as per Article 75 of the Constitution.
After accomplishing the task, instead of proroguing the joint sitting, the speaker had announced adjournment till July 20 as the government had intended to get some more bills passed in the joint sitting which had lapsed after their passage from one house of parliament. 
However, on July 18, the speaker put off the joint sitting till August 22 giving no reason for his act.
The present National Assembly, which has come into existence as a result of the July 25, 2018, general elections, has already entered its last parliamentary year after completing its four-year term on August 12.
During the fourth parliamentary year, the lower house of the parliament passed some 55 bills, taking the total number of bills passed by the present assembly to 155.
The statistics available on the official website of the National Assembly shows that the lower house of the parliament had approved 60 bills during its third parliamentary year, 30 in the second parliamentary year and only 10 during the first parliamentary year.

4,‘Descent without ATC clearance’ behind PIA planes’ near-miss,Iranian incident report suggests remedial measures to prevent such a situation from occurring again.,"RAWALPINDI: The Iranian Civil Aviation Organisation (CAO), which investigated the July incident when two Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) planes flying over the Iranian territory narrowly escaped a mid-air collision, has found that one of the aircraft descended without Air Traffic Control (ATC) clearance.
Based on their findings, the Iranian authorities have suggested that the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) take remedial action about the pilot’s “misunderstanding” for prevention of similar occurrences, according to a CAO report available with Dawn.
The matter was probed by the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) of Iran after the PIA had asked the Iranian aviation authorities to dig out facts behind the incident, allegedly caused by ‘wrong instructions’ by the [Iran] ATC to Peshawar-bound PK-286 that subsequently came in the way of Dubai-bound PK-211 flight.
On July 24, PIA flights PK-211 (Boeing 777), en route from Islamabad to Dubai, and another PK-286 (Airbus A320), flying from Doha to Peshawar, came dangerously close to each other, when their Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) — a system in the cockpit on all planes that automatically guides it by communicating with the TCAS of another aircraft — corrected their course. Sources said Captain Athar Haroon was flying the Boeing 777, while Captain Samiullah was flying Airbus A320.

Iranian incident report suggests remedial measures to prevent such a situation from occurring again

“Based on radar service within control area (airspace), the controller’s instructions and clearance for both traffics were correct, and the cause of TCAS/resolution advisory (RA) serious incident was the pilot’s misunderstanding, leading to mistakenly (PIA211) commence descent without receiving any clearance from Tehran [air traffic] controller,” the AAIB report stated about the cause.
In its report, the AAIB’s safety investigation panel concluded, “The flight PIA211 started to descend without ATC clearance. Details of the flight plan route for PIA211 were against Iran Traffic Orientation Scheme (TOS). Disclosure of the incident report details to public by Pakistan International Airlines spokesperson before issuing the Final Report was against international regulations.”
The report also issued safety recommendations to avert recurrence of such incidents. The Iranian authorities suggested the Pakistan CAA “take remedial action about pilot mistake based on the findings on the report for prevention of similar occurrences”. Simultaneously, it also wrote to the Iranian Airport and Air Navigation Company, “Even though the phraseology used by the controller was proper and correct, in order to prevent such an ambiguity or misunderstanding by pilots, it is recommended to make an inquiry from other States about similar and proper phraseology, for the purpose of substitution or amendment of current phraseology.”
The report recalled the on July 24, PIA’s flight PK-211 made a radio contact with Tehran air traffic controller, when it was identified by the Tehran radar controller. The pilot then requested the controller to advise any “level restriction at MOBET position, and the controller told him expect FL200 20 miles before PATAT, ‘report when ready for descent’. The granted message was acknowledged by the pilot accordingly”.
“Another flight, PIA286… on reciprocal track… was identified by the Tehran radar controller, and following the pilot’s request, this flight was instructed to proceed directly to NABOX waypoint. At 005107UTC, the controller instructed the PIA211 to proceed directly to PATAT waypoint and expect FL200, 20 [nautical miles] before PATAT and stand by for descent. 
The pilot acknowledged the message correctly. At 005307UTC, the pilot of PIA286 declared TCAS/RA descending. Immediately, the controller told the PIA211, ‘You were told to stand by for descent’.
“At 005407 another flight on frequency told the PIA211 without expressing his call sign: ‘you were never given a clearance; you were told to call when ready’. At 005427UTC, the controller cleared PIA211 to descend FL200 and to maintain 20NM before PATAT waypoint. The message was acknowledged. [Later], PIA211 was handed over to the UAE radar... for further descent.
The report further said that on Jul 27, some parts of the above information were disclosed to social media by PIA.
Meanwhile, according to media reports, due to the alleged negligence of the Iranian ATC, which was said to have cleared the same altitude, the two planes came dangerously close to each other and averted a midair collision over Iranian territory near the UAE airspace.
A PIA spokesman was reported to have said: “The PIA is writing to Iranian ATC to investigate as it instructed the plane, but it was wrong.”
He had said the flight PK-211 was maintaining a 35,000-foot altitude when it came close to PK-268, which was flying at an altitude of 36,000 feet and was cleared to descend to 20,000 feet. 
The descent would have come in the flight path of PK-211, the spokesman added. However, the aircraft’s TCAS corrected the course for both the planes and automatically guided them, he added.
A few days later, Iranian state media had reported the country it was investigating the claim of a near-miss in its airspace between the two passenger jets due to “human error” by air traffic controllers.

5,Death toll in Balochistan rises to 205,"Road, rail links between Quetta and rest of country suspended for days amid heavy rains; centre urged to provide Rs60bn package.","QUETTA: As deadly flash floods and torrential rains continue to ravage many parts of Balochistan, with no rail and road link between Quetta and rest of the country despite all-out efforts for past several days, the provincial government called upon the Centre to provide a special package of Rs60 billion for repair of infrastructure and rehabilitation of flood-hit families.
Officials put the death toll across the province at 205 after floodwaters swept away five people near Saranan area of Pishin district on Tuesday evening and the body of a five-year-old girl was recovered from Syed Hameed river in Saranan area. The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) did not release the death toll till late on Wednesday night.
The railway track connecting Balochistan with other provinces has been submerged by floodwater for past several days, causing suspension of passenger and goods train services, while railway officials believed the restoration would take some more days.

Road, rail links between Quetta and rest of country suspended for days amid heavy rains; Centre urged to provide Rs60bn package

Railway officials said no train could leave for Karachi, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from Quetta for the past three days. “All coming and outgoing trains have not left for their destination,” an official said, adding that engineers and other staff of Pakistan Railways would check the track once floodwater receded and the train service would resume between Quetta and the rest of the country after their clearance. “Rail service restoration would take some more days,” the official said.
“Around 5km of the main railway line is still under water,” a senior official of the local administration told Dawn, adding that the road traffic was facing the same situation.
Meanwhile, the Balochistan government sent a resolution adopted by the provincial assembly recently to Islamabad. “Balochistan, having meagre resources, is not able to rehabilitate the destroyed areas and compensate the people who suffered huge financial losses,” the resolution stated. 
It asked the provincial government to approach the federal government for a special package of at least Rs50bn to Rs60bn for the rehabilitation of 32 destroyed districts and waive off all utility bills and agriculture loans in the districts that had been declared calamity-hit areas.

6,New seeds approved to increase rice yield,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to increase the yield from rice crops, nine hybrid and one long grain variety of rice were...","ISLAMABAD: In a bid to increase the yield from rice crops, nine hybrid and one long grain variety of rice were approved on Wednesday for commercial cultivation during the next kharif season.
The hybrid varieties have been developed by the private sector while the long grain variety was developed by the Punjab government’s Soil Salinity Research Institute, a research scientist at Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) said.
The varieties were given the nod by PARC’s Rice Variety Evaluation Committee in a meeting headed by the committee’s Chairman Dr Imtiaz Hussain.
The meeting was attended by PARC Chairman Dr Ghulam Muhammad Ali, representatives of national and multinational seed companies and federal and provincial research institutes.
The PARC chairman emphasised the importance of quality seeds to enhance the productivity and profitability of farmers and directed seed companies to provide high quality seeds to farmers.
The PARC was committed to performing its role in variety evaluation in a transparent manner in collaboration with the national agricultural research system, said Dr Hussain.
According to research scientists, the new varieties would replace most of the low yield varieties during next Kharif season.
According to the Rice Research Institute, hybrid seeds offer at least 15 to 20 per cent better yield as compared to the inbred variety grown under similar conditions.
Pakistan’s share in global rice trade is around 9.10pc which contributes more than $2 billion annually to the national kitty, according to the institute’s data.
Rice, the second most important cash crop of the country, covers 11pc of the total cultivated area. Since 2000, 10 to 12 varieties of rice have been under commercial cultivation in the country.
