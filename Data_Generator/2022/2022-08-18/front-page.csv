• Says process of appointing new army chief hasn’t yet begun
ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has blamed PTI chairman Imran Khan for “patronising” his close aide Shahbaz Gill and others to launch a “derogatory” social media campaign targeting the Lasbela chopper crash martyrs, alleging that it was a joint project of the PTI and India against the Pakistan Army.
“Imran Khan waited for five days (after Shahbaz Gill’s statement on the army) as he hoped to reap the dividends but now he disowned Gill’s statement in the face of a backlash,” the defence min­ister told reporters at a press conference in Islamabad.
“You will see Imran Khan will disown some others in the near future,” he said in reply to a question.
After the military chopper crash during flood relief operations in Balochistan earlier this month, some social media accounts launched a campaign to advance their personal and political malice, drawing a strong reaction from citizens, political leadership and state institutions.
The ruling coalition immediately blamed the PTI’s social media team for launching the smear campaign at the behest of the party chief.
Later, PTI leader Shahbaz Gill during his talk with a TV channel made some comments that were seen as instigating rebellion within the armed forces. He was later arrested and the PTI chief claimed that he was tortured in detention.
During the presser, the defence minister said all these “diversionary tactics” were aimed at removing attention from the verdict in the PTI’s prohibited funding case.
He said all relevant institutions were in action to hold those accountable behind the “anti-army campaign” and in the funding case.
The minister said an investigation into the campaign had found that 529 Pakistani accounts, 18 Indian accounts and 33 accounts from other countries were involved. “The investigation is reaching its conclusion and action would be taken on the results as per the law and the Constitution.”
He said the matter had shamed the entire nation before the martyrs’ families that “there are such people found among us who can stoop so low for their political motives”.
Mr Asif said the data was “confirmed and verified,” and more revelations would be coming soon.
However, he said the government would not make any move against the PTI that would give an impression that it was settling a score. “What happened to us during the PTI regime is a separate issue,” he said.
The defence minister said Imran Khan had talked against the military many times in the past and in the 90s he used to bash the army while sitting in India.
He said the Indian channels were praising Imran Khan these days as they believed they wouldn’t have achieved even after spending billions of dollars what the PTI chief was doing for them.
Army chief’s appointment
Responding to a query about the appointment of new army chief, the defence minister said, “No such process has been started as yet.”
The army chief’s appointment is due in November, with military spokesperson Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar already clarifying that COAS Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa would retire on Nov 29.
Asked about the possible unemployment of the workers of ARY News that has been pulled off air for promoting the “anti-army campaign”, Khawaja Asif said Shahbaz Gill used the TV channel as a medium to promote his agenda against the army and if action was taken against him the channel would also face repercussions.
However, he expressed sympathy for the channel’s employees but said its owners were quite well off and should take care of the workers.

1,Capital police prevail in tug of war over Shahbaz Gill’s custody,"Court grants Islamabad police two-day physical remand; Gill moved to Pims, five-member board set up for his medical examination.","• Rawalpindi and Islamabad police come face to face outside Adiala Jail
• Court grants Islamabad police two-day physical remand
• Faisal Javed declares Gill’s words ‘a blunder’ in Senate
RAWALPINDI: After a two-hour long stand-off with Rawalpindi police, the capital’s police force finally managed to get the custody of PTI leader Dr Shahbaz Gill and moved him to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) on Wednesday night.
Later, Pims set up a five-member board to examine Mr Gill’s condition.
A judicial magistrate had granted a two-day physical remand of Mr Gill and ordered the Islamabad police to conduct a medical examination.
However, Mr Gill, who was booked in a sedition case, was being held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, which falls within the jurisdiction of the Punjab government.
In a bid to thwart the handover, arrangements were made to move Mr Gill to Raw­a­l­pindi District Head­quarters (DHQ) Hospital after he complained of breathing trouble, even though jail authorities were convinced that they had the facilities to treat Mr Gill.
Sources said a police party, led by Rawalpindi City Police Officer Syed Shahzad Nadeem Bukhari, reached the prison to comply with Punjab home department’s orders to shift Mr Gill to DHQ hospital.
On the other side, a team of Islamabad police, led by the SSP Operations, remained outside the jail to take him into custody.
As the stand-off intensified, the interior ministry mulled calling Rangers to force the handover, per unconfirmed reports. However, no such movement was witnessed on the ground.
Earlier in the day, an Islamabad sessions judge sent Mr Gill on a two-day physical remand upon the request of Islamabad police.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Zeba Chaudhry accepted the application filed by the Islamabad Advocate General Jahangir Khan Jadoon.
Special Prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi pleaded that the remand was needed for further investigation and to collect the evidence. He argued that police have nominated Mr Gill in an FIR and his specific role in the case has been identified.
The recovery of his mobile phone was imperative to identify the ‘co conspirators’ and ‘those who wrote the script’, the prosecutor argued.
After hearing the arguments, ADSJ Chaudhry, while giving him into police custody for 48 hours, ordered them to get Mr Gill medically examined forthwith.
She also directed police to produce him before a judicial magistrate after the expiry of the two-day remand.
Mr Gill’s counsel had opposed the handover to the police and subsequently challenged the remand order.
After the court’s order, PTI Chairman Imran Khan took to Twitter to express his concerns over the move to send Mr Gill into police remand for the second time.
A tweet posted on the former prime minister’s official account said: “Very concerned about Shahbaz Gill being sent into police remand again. He is in a fragile state of mental & physical health because of the torture inflicted on him when he was abducted & taken to undisclosed location & then again at the police station.”
Mr Khan added that this was part of a conspiracy to target him and the PTI through a false confession, obtained through coercion.
While calling the action “absolutely unacceptable” Mr Khan vowed to take “all legal and political actions” to counter the alleged torture on Mr Gill and the “unconstitutional and illegal actions” agains the party leaders.
 






PTI Senior Vice President Fawad Chaudhry also reacted strongly to the order and said that judges were sending political workers into police remand to be tortured.
Also on Wednesday, PTI Senator Faisal Javed Khan conceded on the floor of the Senate that Mr Gill’s remarks against the armed forces were “a blunder”.
Speaking in the upper house, Mr Javed, who is believed to be a close confidant of Imran Khan, said the party leader’s chief of staff should not have made these remarks.
“Shahbaz Gill should be acted against and legal proceedings should take place because such statements cannot be acceptable.” he remarked.
However, he stressed that a fair trial should be held and condemned the alleged torture against Mr Gill. He also called applying the law uniformly, pointing out that leaders from the opposition had made much harsher remarks against state institutions. “They should also be brought to the dock,” he remarked.
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Dr Shahzad Wasim also accused the government of demonstrating the worst kind of fascism and committing blatant human rights violations. He said a fair trial was the right of every citizen under the Constitution. He alleged that a conspiracy was being hatched to create a gulf between PTI and Pakistan Army.

2,SC tells ECP to go ahead with second phase of LG polls in Sindh,CJP Bandial says  MQM-P should approach ECP for postponement of local government elections.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court ordered the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday to go ahead with the second phase of local government elections in Sindh.
After three days of continuous hearing on a set of petitions, a three-judge SC bench made a specific mention of an intervener — Jamaat-i-Islami’s (JI) Karachi chief Naeemur Rehman — who had regretted that local polls were already behind schedule by over two years.
While disposing of the matter, a short order dictated by Chief Justice of Pakis­tan Umar Ata Bandial said the pro­cess to hold the local government ele­ctions cannot be stopped at this stage.
The bench, consisting of the CJP, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Ayesha Malik, had taken up a set of petitions filed by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and others against the Sindh Local Government Act (SLGA) as well as seeking postponement of the second phase of local government elections in Sindh, slated for Aug 28.
The first phase of local government elections was held in 14 districts of Sindh on June 26.
On Wednesday, Advocate General for Sindh (AGS) Hassan Akbar and the provincial local government secretary briefed the apex court about the procedure adopted for delimitation of constituencies of union committees and union councils.
The officials informed the Supreme Court that population was not the sole consideration for delimitation of constituencies.
The advocate general drew the court’s attention to the guidelines suggested by the Sindh High Court through a 2016 judgement in a similar case for carrying out the delimitation process for local government elections.
The CJP observed that the apex court decides matters on the basis of law and not on the basis of disputes, but in this case the questions of law have partially been addressed by SHC. After this the MQM approached the ECP.
The CJP observed that the system was working smoothly since there was coordination between the ECP and provincial governments, but none of these issues were discussed before the SHC vis-à-vis MQM because the first phase of local government elections were only 10 days away when the party challenged the vires of Section 10(1) of SLGA-2013 in the high court.
Therefore, the MQM should carry on its battle before either the Election Commission or the Sindh High Court by making a robust case, CJP Bandial observed.
Muttahida’s perception
Justice Ayesha Malik observed that enactment of new rules at this stage would complicate matters as the first phase of local elections had already been held and the issue had not been challenged before any court.
The petitioner (MQM) believed that Section 10(1) of SLGA was arbitrary, but it did not challenge the vires of the law, Justice Malik recalled.
However, Barrister Farogh Naseem said he had challenged the law through an application before the Sindh High Court.
In its order the court recalled how the petitioner had sought an amendment in its original petition before the SHC through an application on June 18, challenging the first phase of local government elections. Voting for the first phase took place on June 26.
That amended petition contained new points like exercise of authority by the provincial government under Section 10(1) of SLGA. It contended that such exercise of power was in conflict with a 2014 Supreme Court judgement and that no criterion was laid down for the implementation of Section 10 of SLGA.
But these points were never pressed before the SHC and, furthermore, the application to amend the original petition was not allowed.
Salahuddin Ahmed, representing the PTI, said he would not oppose the second phase of elections, saying all he wanted was that the apex court’s Feb 1 directive should be implemented in letter and spirit.
Through its Feb 1 judgement, the Supreme Court had restrained the Sindh government from undertaking fresh projects that fall within the domain of an elected local government, without consent of that particular body. Salahuddin Ahmed argued that without meaningful devolution of powers to elected local bodies by the Sindh government, the tenure of elected representatives would become meaningless.
The court, however, observed that it was not in a position to consider the plea at the moment, but he was at liberty to file a petition for implementation of the Feb 1 order.
Fehmida Mirza, a former speaker of the National Assembly, complained that the names of a number of voters in Badin, her hometown, had been removed from the voters list. She regretted the ECP had become a “distant observer who watches helplessly all the time”.
The entire election was being conducted by the provincial administration, she alleged, adding that in eight wards in Badin, the population had exceeded the permissible 10 per cent variation formula.
“Is it a coincidence that a large number of members who were elected unopposed in the first phase, belong to the ruling party in Sindh.”
The court suggested Fehmida Mirza to file a petition before a relevant forum since the ECP was making efforts for holding the second phase of elections.

3,Imran’s papers for NA-108 by-poll rejected,LAHORE / TOBA TEK SINGH: The nomination papers of PTI chairman Imran Khan for the NA-108 (Faisalabad) seat have been...,"LAHORE / TOBA TEK SINGH: The nomination papers of PTI chairman Imran Khan for the NA-108 (Faisalabad) seat have been rejected by the returning officer for “unsatisfactory declaration of statement of assets and liabilities”.
District Election Moni­toring Officer Zaroya Amjad and Election Commission’s Punjab spokesperson Huda Gohar told Dawn the PTI chairman’s papers have been rejected because of unsatisfactory declaration of statement of assets and liabilities and not because of a signature issue, as claimed by the PTI.
Ms Amjad said the Form-B filed along with the nomination papers of Mr Khan was not satisfactory.
The order of the returning officer said: “There is difference of cost in the assets of the candidate [Imran Khan] annexed with nomination papers and the statements of assets & liabilities submitted before the Election Commission of Pakistan during the years published in the Gazette of Pakistan on March 12, 2019, March 26, 2020 & May 24, 2021. Form-B annexed with nomination papers does not provide accurate picture of his assets & liabilities. The candidate has concealed the items received by him from Toshakhana.”
The PTI smelled a rat in the rejection of Mr Khan’s papers, alleging the returning officer was under pressure to do so. The PTI said it would challenge the decision in the high court.
“District Election Commissioner (returning officer for NA-108) Irfan Kausar had already made up his mind to reject the nomination papers of Imran Khan as he was under pressure. He had told us ahead of his decision that we should go to the high court (against his verdict),” PTI’s central information secretary Farrukh Habib said in a series of tweets and in his press conference in Faisalabad in response to the party’s reaction to the returning officer’s decision.
Expressing wonder over the decision, Mr Habib said: “How come the returning officer can reject the nomination papers on a flimsy ground while in other eight NA constituencies where the by-poll is taking place and no such objection is made. We will challenge this decision in the court and we are hopeful that Imran would be allowed to contest for NA-108.”
In case the returning officer’s decision is upheld, Farrukh Habib will be the PTI’s candidate on this seat. This seat was held by Mr Habib in 2018 polls and fell vacant when National Assembly Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf accepted his resignation along with 10 others. The by-poll will be held here on September 25.
The returning officer accepted the nomination papers of PML-N candidate Abid Sher Ali. The same day, the returning officer of NA-118 Nankana Sahib did not raise any such objection to Imran Khan’s nomination papers and accepted them.
In NA-118, PML-N’s Shezra Mansab’s nomination papers have also been accepted. Shezra is the joint candidate of the PML-N and its 12 allied parties.
Meanwhile, the ECP has constituted teams to monitor by polls in Punjab. “The teams will monitor the campaign of the candidates and make sure that they follow election code of conduct,” it said.
According to the ECP, the by-elections for the constituencies of NA-22 Mardan, NA-24 Charsadda, NA-31 Peshawar, NA-45 Kurram, NA-108 Faisalabad, NA-118 Nankana Sahib and Karachi’s NA-237, NA-239 and NA-246 will be held on Sept 25.
Imran Khan had announced contesting on all nine seats. The returning officers have accepted his nomination papers on eight seats.

4,"COMMENT: Managing external financing gap, the unconventional way","It's right time to introduce measures to incentivise exporters, remitters to bring in existing foreign currency remittances.","THE global economy is passing through a perfect storm. The commodity super-cycle has led to record high prices of essential imports. On the other hand, emerging markets face capital flight with rising interest rates in the US and EU markets. Emerging economies are facing stress with rising import bills and depleting central bank reserves. Lebanon, Sri Lanka, Suriname, and Zambia are already in default.
Pakistan has done better as proactive measures taken by the government have averted the threat of default. These include measures to curb imports and budgetary measures to restore the IMF programme. Markets are reacting positively to these policy measures; yields on Pakistan sovereign international bonds have declined sharply to 22pc, from peak levels of 50pc in July 2022. The stock market has rallied 7pc in August, while the rupee has strengthened over 10pc in the last week days.
However, despite the recent improvements in sentiment, the large external financing needs over the medium-term continue to cast a long shadow over the economy. According to the IMF staff report in February 2022, Pakistan’s external financing needs will remain high — around $35bn to $40bn annually — over the medium term.
Stability in the foreign exchange market is crucial for creating a conducive environment for local businesses: attracting new investments, supporting growth, and managing inflation expectations. However, given the large external financing needs, the rupee will likely remain under stress as the demand for dollars remains significantly higher than the available supply in the market, at least in the immediate run.
With overall global sentiment on capital markets being negative, and the rating outlook downgrade by international rating agencies, we are effectively priced out of the international bond markets. This leaves the economy too dependent on borrowing from multilateral agencies and bilateral loans from friendly countries. The large funding requirements in emerging markets have put us in a weak position to negotiate better terms and conditions.
Therefore, other than ensuring that existing forex flows continue to trickle into the country without delays – to avoid any see-sawing of the exchange rate in the market, as recently witnessed – alternative sources of dollar-funding need to be explored and managed in the medium term to ensure stability.
Read: The default response
When the going is good, as is the case in the currency market right now, it is the right time to introduce certain measures so that the exporters and remitters can be incentivised or coerced to bring in the existing foreign currency remittances stuck outside the country, and ensure that they continue to arrive without delay and keep the markets calm.
The central bank requires better engagement with banks, perhaps on a daily basis at the treasury level, and with money changers. Better and aggressive enforcement of discipline is also a need of the hour.
On the other hand, the most significant alternative source of external financing in the last 3 years is the Roshan Digital Account (RDA) initiative of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Naya Pakistan Certificates (NPC) of the government of Pakistan. Approximately $4.8bn inflows have materialised under this scheme since September 2020, out of which $3.1bn is investments in NPC.
However, inflows have slowed down sharply in the last few months due to unfavorable global market conditions. While global interest rates have risen sharply – with the benchmark six-month Libor trading around 3.6pc today compared to 0.15pc in the same period last year – the profit rates offered on NPCs have remained unchanged at 5.5pc to 7pc across different tenors.
The profit rates on NPC instruments need to be market-based and linked to Libor rates. Even at a spread of 500 basis points over the Libor, the NPC profit rate of 8.5pc will be significantly lower than the borrowing cost from international bond markets, currently at 22pc. Urgent attention is needed to keep NPC products attractive to incentivise fresh inflows and discourage existing investors from pulling out.
The second area that needs to be addressed is the large and growing onshore holding of foreign currency assets, mostly cash held by individuals for saving or payment needs. No formal estimates exist of the size of these holdings, but their significance can be gauged from the following data points; first of which is the size of the foreign currency deposits of the banking sector. These stand at around $5.8bn today, down from $7.1bn last year. In 1998, before the freezing of foreign currency accounts, the size of these deposits used to be as high as $11bn.
The second data point is currency in circulation: the latest SBP data shows that this has increased to Rs8 trillion ($35bn) and makes up around 30pc of the total money supply in the economy and 40pc of bank deposits.
High currency in circulation is also highly inflationary in nature. In previous episodes of market turbulence, the low deposit base of banks struggled to meet the deficit financing needs of the government, leading to money-printing by the SBP.
During periods of uncertainty and exchange rate volatility, many private investors convert their cash holdings into dollars. The reason investors prefer to hold foreign currency assets ‘under the mattresses’ (in cash or in their bank lockers) is the lack of returns offered by commercial banks and lack of alternate investment avenues. There is also reluctance to declare these assets to tax authorities for obvious reasons.
Therefore, the primary objective should be to cut down on currency in circulation and that is only possible with reduced financing requirements of the government, either by keeping the debt-servicing lower by managing the policy rate at the right levels (as the demand for currency in circulation isn’t amenable to policy rate changes), or by avoiding fresh debt by enhancing tax and non-tax revenues. We need to remind ourselves that we have to borrow to service our existing debt.
The other option is to ensure that the enhanced money supply will be used to meet the mainstream requirements of the economy, which at this stage is dollar inflows – ideally in the form of exports or other sources of investment (bank deposits or otherwise) – to enhance the forex pool in the country and ease-off pressure on the government’s reserves. Today, an investor will get only 0.2pc to 0.75pc on their foreign currency deposits, while big depositors can negotiate a higher rate. In comparison, commercial banks in India offer returns of 2.85pc or higher on foreign currency deposits. The central bank in India has recently waived the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) and Statutory Liquidity Requirement (SLR) requirement on incremental foreign currency deposits, incentivising banks to raise them.
The writers are a former governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, and the president and CEO of the Bank of Punjab, respectively.
This is the first of two articles; the next installment will appear in tomorrow’s edition of Dawn.
