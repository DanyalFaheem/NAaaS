0,Ronaldo says truth will be revealed over Manchester United future soon,"Ronaldo, who rejoined United a year ago from Juventus, has a year left on his contract.","LONDON: Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo says he will reveal the truth in a couple of weeks after constant speculation about his future at the club. 
The Portugal forward missed United’s pre-season tour to Thailand and Australia due to personal reasons as speculation swirled over whether he would be leaving Old Trafford. 
It has been reported Ronaldo wants to play Champions League football, but United maintain the 37-year-old is not for sale and remains an integral part of the plans of new boss Erik ten Hag. 
“They [will] know the truth when they interview in a couple weeks,” the 37-year-old said on Instagram. 
Ronaldo also liked a post from a fan saying that Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone wanted to sign him. 
Replying to the post, Ronaldo said: “The media is telling lies. I have a notebook and in the last few months of the 100 news [stories] I made, only five were right. Imagine how it is. Stick with that tip.” 
Ronaldo, who rejoined United a year ago from Juventus, has a year left on his contract. 
He was their top scorer last season with 24 goals in all competitions but was criticised by Ten Hag after leaving a pre-season match against Rayo Vallecano early after being substituted at halftime. 
United missed out on the Champions League last season, finishing sixth in the Premier League, and have suffered a dreadful start to the new campaign, losing both their opening games and sitting bottom of the table. They host Liverpool on Monday. 
Former United player Gary Neville was fiercely critical of the club after Saturday’s 4-0 defeat by Brentford and called on Ronaldo to be clear about his situation. 
“Why does the greatest player of all time [in my opinion] have to wait two weeks to tell Manchester United fans the truth?,” Neville said in a Twitter post. “Stand up now and speak. The club is in crisis and it needs leaders to lead. He’s the only one who can grab this situation by the scruff of the neck!” 
United’s owners, the Glazer family, have come under fire following the team’s terrible start. 
Manchester United supporters’ group — The 1958 —is planning a protest march outside Old Trafford against the club’s owners ahead of the Liverpool match. 
In a statement the group said the ownership was “systematically starving and killing the greatest football institution in world football, for greed”. 
“We appreciate emotions are running high,” it added. “We must keep it legal, we must keep it peaceful....Bring the heat, bring the noise, bring the passion. Let’s show the Glazer family that this time it will not blow over.” 
Billionaire Elon Musk sparked a social media frenzy on Tuesday evening when he raised the prospect of buying United from the Glazer family. 
The Tesla CEO made the comment in a tweet, then later clarified his position by saying he had no intention of buying a sports team and that it had been a “long-running joke”.

1,Tokyo Olympics exec arrested over suspected graft,"TOKYO: Japanese prosecutors arrested a former member of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics board, Haruyuki Takahashi, on...","TOKYO: Japanese prosecutors arrested a former member of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics board, Haruyuki Takahashi, on Wednesday on suspicion of receiving bribes, the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor’s Office said. 
The 78-year-old Takahashi was not immediately available for comment and did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. 
The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that he was suspected of receiving bribes amounting to hundreds of billions of yen from high-street business-suit retailer Aoki Holdings, an official partner of last year’s pandemic-delayed 2020 Games. 
Former chairman of Aoki Holdings, Hironori Aoki, 83, and two other executives linked to the company were also arrested in connection with the case, according to the prosecutor’s office. 
They accuse Takahashi of accepting bribes “with the understanding they were meant as thank-you money for the beneficial and preferential treatment” he bestowed on Aoki. 
According to the prosecutors, Takahashi had a total of 51 million yen ($380,000 at today’s rates) transferred to the bank account of a company he runs, in more than 50 transactions between October 2017 and March 2022. 
Later in the day, Aoki Holdings issued a statement apologising for the “enormous trouble” caused by the arrests and saying the firm “takes the matter seriously”. “We will continue to cooperate fully with investigations by authorities,” it said. 
The arrests came after Takahashi’s Tokyo home was raided last month by investigators, according to Japanese media, with searches also conducted at the Aoki chairman’s home and the disbanded Tokyo 2020 organising committee office. 
Takahashi, a former executive at Japan’s biggest advertising agency, Dentsu, served on the Tokyo 2020 board from June 2014. 
During that time he was reportedly considered a quasi-civil servant who was not permitted to accept money or gifts related to his position. 
A spokesperson for Dentsu Inc said the company had no immediate comment. 
The Tokyo 2020 organising committee wound down operations last month, but it maintains a presence to deal with assets and liabilities. 
The Tokyo Olympics were held in 2021 after an unprecedented one-year delay because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Stadiums were largely empty with fans banned over surging virus infections in Japan. 
Aoki became a Tokyo Games sponsor in October 2018, allowing it to use the event’s logo and sell officially licensed products. 
The case is not the first time questions have been raised about alleged impropriety around the Games. 
French prosecutors launched an investigation into allegations of corruption linked to Tokyo’s bid for the Games in 2016. 
The former head of Japan’s Olympic Committee, Tsunekazu Takeda, stepped down in 2019 as French authorities probed his involvement in payments made before Tokyo was awarded the event.

The newly-elected PHA president is in the United States and got a vote of  confidence  from the general body. Asif Nawaz — brother of PHF president  Khalid Sajjad Khokhar — stepped down as president to the post of  secretary.
The elections were held at the Country and Garrison Club instead of the PHF’s offices in the National Hockey Stadium, fearing the clubs of Lahore may try to sabotage the process as the elections of the Lahore district were not held due to issues of the Election Commission with the clubs’ owners on scrutiny process.
However, the crisis of the PHF seems to be increasing in future as the  Pakistan Sports Board is not accepting these elections, as the  four-member committee it appointed to conduct the polls was not accepted  by the PHF president Khokhar, considering it as interference in the  affairs of the federation.
The elections in the other provinces were also completed and now the elections of the PHF will be held in Karachi on Friday.

The Border-Gavaskar series between India and Australia will feature a Test more and will be contested over five matches, according to the Future Tours Programme (FTP) for 2023-27 released by the International Cricket Council on Wednesday.
Rohit Sharma’s men are scheduled to tour Down Under at the end of 2024 while Australia will play their away series in India at the start of 2027, the FTP showed. 
“The increase to a reciprocal five Test Border-Gavaskar series is a significant milestone and will greatly enhance the enduring rivalry and respect that exists between the Australian and Indian men’s teams,” said Peter Roach, Cricket Australia’s head of cricket operations and scheduling.
India, who finished runner-up behind New Zealand in the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC), will also host England for a five-Test series at the start of 2024 before travelling to meet Ben Stokes’ side the following year for five Tests.
Outside bilateral cricket, the next four-year cycle will see one edition each of the 50-over Cricket World Cup (2023) and Champions Trophy (2025), two editions each of the Twenty20 World Cup (2024, 2026) and the WTC Finals (2025).
The proliferation of lucrative domestic T20 leagues have cramped up cricket’s already-strained calendar but despite that the 12 Full Members will play a total of 777 international matches compared to the 694 in the current cycle.
“The landscape around the game is continuing to evolve and we will work closely with members as we collectively adapt to that,” Wasim Khan, ICC general manager of cricket, said in a statement on Wednesday. 
“We are committed to growing the game and giving more fans more opportunities to enjoy cricket, but are very mindful of the need to balance that ambition with the welfare of players.”

5,PCB unconcerned  by PSL-IPL clash in 2025 as ICC announces new FTP cycle,"The February-March window, which accommodates PSL in normal circumstances, will be occupied by the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025.","KARACHI: The dates of the Pakistan Super League’s 10th edition are set to clash with the Indian Premier League for the first time in 2025 after the International Cricket Council announced the Future Tours Programme cycle for the next four years on Wednesday.
But having to compete with unarguably the strongest franchise cricket tournament in the world is not concerning the Pakistan Cricket Board.
The February-March window, which accommodates the PSL in normal circumstances, will be occupied by the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025. The cash rich league in that year, therefore, is scheduled for March-May, almost partly simultaneous with the IPL’s extended window, which runs till the beginning of June.
The clash with the IPL will mean top international players will be unavailable to participate in the PSL, due to the massive amount of money on offer for them in India.
The PCB, however, is looking at the scenario from a different angle. The “philosophy” at the board’s offices is that the PSL “doesn’t need to rely on foreign players to attract eye balls”.
“It’s the local players that make the tournament worth watching,” a PCB official told Dawn on Wednesday.
For the PCB, the PSL’s clash of dates with the IPL may fall in Pakistan’s favour. During the IPL’s window, no international cricket is scheduled, which, according to the official “makes more players available to choose from”.
“The IPL may attract the best of the best players but the best ones will play in the PSL,” said the official.
Dawn understands the PCB preferred giving the national side match practice ahead of the Champions Trophy by scheduling its visit to New Zealand for three One-day Internationals and two T20 games in January 2025 and hosting the Black Caps and South Africa for a 50-over tri-nation series just ahead of the ICC event rather than sticking with the regular PSL window.
Tri-nation cricket will also return to Pakistan’s calendar for the first time since 2004-05 and it will host England and Sri Lanka its second such tournament in October-November 2026.
Pakistan is also set to host the 50-over Asia Cup in September next year. However, there is high probability that India will decline to travel across the border for the continental event due to tense political relations between the neighbouring countries.
Sources said the Asia Cup is organised by the Asian Cricket Council and “a situation where one of the participants pull out is for the ACC to deal with.”
The ICC World Cup in India follows after the Asia Cup and, according to a source, Pakistan will not hesitate to travel for that. However, if India does not return the favour by visiting Pakistan for the Champions Trophy less than two years later, there are chances the PCB boycotts the 2026 T20 World Cup, also to be hosted by India.
The allocation of the Champions Trophy to Pakistan, however, was approved by the ICC board, which has the representation of the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI).
According to the FTP, Pakistan will play the lowest number of Test matches (27) as compared to other Test-playing nations. However, all of Pakistan’s Test matches will be played as part of the 2023-25 and 2025-27 World Test Championship cycles.
Three Test-playing countries — Bangladesh, New Zealand and South Africa — have decided to play series against the likes of Ireland, Afghanistan and Zimbabwe — teams that are not part of the WTC — while Pakistan have refrained from that, specially due to the fact that hosting Test cricket is expensive with the extensive nature of the format.
Pakistan’s inability to play against India also costs them a minimum of six Test matches, hence a lower number of games than its WTC opponents. The national side still plays one more Test than its last four-year FTP cycle.
In the WTC, Pakistan will play Tests against Australia (away), Bangladesh (home), England (home), South Africa (away), Sri Lanka (away) and West Indies (home), while their matches in the 2025-2027 championship are against Bangladesh (away), England (away), New Zealand (home), South Africa (home), Sri Lanka (home) and West Indies (away).
‘ONE-EYE’ ON ICC EVENTS
Pakistan have ensured they go well-prepared in ICC’s global events.
“Pakistan will play 11 T20Is against the Netherlands, Ireland and England in the build up to the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2024, which will be jointly hosted by the United States and the West Indies,” said a PCB statement.
Ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup, Pakistan will host Australia for a three-match T20 series.
Afghanistan, Ireland and Zimbabwe  will also play white-ball matches in Pakistan between 2023 and 2027.
In total, Pakistan will feature in around 238 days of international cricket during the four-year FTP period comprising 27 WTC fixtures (13 home and 14 away), 47 ODIs (26 home and 21 home) and 56 T20Is (27 home and 29 away).
These include matches in the 50-over Asia Cup and the Champions Trophy respectively.
“While finalising our Future Tours Programme 2023-2027 in a tight and densely-packed cricket calendar, we have given priority to context, quality and player workload,” PCB chief executive officer Faisal Hasnain said in a statement.
“We have also tried to find an appropriate balance across all the three formats so that these continue to co-exist meaningfully.”

6,Rabada and Nortje rock England before rain ends first day,LONDON: South Africa quicks Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje tore through England’s top order to leave the home ...,"LONDON: South Africa quicks Kagiso Rabada and Anrich Nortje tore through England’s top order to leave the home side teetering on 116-6 before rain brought a premature close to the opening day of the first Test at Lord’s on Wednesday. 
Rabada, passed fit following an ankle injury, removed openers Alex Lees and Zak Crawley early on during a return of 2-36 in 12 overs. 
And Nortje, one of eight South Africans playing their first Test in England, grabbed 3-43, including the scalp of home captain Ben Stokes. 
England looked as though they would be bowled out for a low total before the weather intervened just six overs after the lunch interval and no more play was possible. 
Ollie Pope produced a lone resistance to the visitors’ relentless onslaught and is unbeaten on 61. He will resume the innings on the second morning with Stuart Broad, who has yet to score. 
The tale of the first day has been South Africa’s aggressive and accurate fast bowling rather than England’s swashbuckling ‘Bazball’ style under their new leadership pairing of Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum that had brought the home side four excellent test wins in a row earlier in the summer. 
All of those victories had been achieved by chasing down targets in the fourth innings, something that cannot happen in this match after South Africa captain Dean Elgar won the toss and fielded on a green-tinged pitch under overcast skies. 
Elgar’s doubts over whether England could maintain their aggressive approach with the bat against an attack that has helped South Africa climb to the top of the World Test Championship table were soon justified. 
Spearhead fast bowler Rabada, 27, made an excellent start, dismissing both England openers cheaply to catches behind the wicket. 
Lees (5) went too hard at a delivery just outside his off-stump and was caught comfortably by wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne, while Crawley (9) edged to a diving Aiden Markram at second slip. 
Crawley’s exit left him with a lowly Test average for a specialist batsman of 26 from 47 innings. 
Star batsman Joe Root was powerless to stop the rot, the former England captain lbw for eight to a huge inswinger from towering left-arm paceman Marco Jansen. Root reviewed Indian umpire Nitin Menon’s decision but replays indicated the ball would have clipped leg stump. 
Jonny Bairstow had made 106 and an unbeaten 114 during England’s most recent Test, a seven-wicket win over India at Edgbaston last month. 
But he was bowled between bat and pad for a five-ball duck by Nortje as he tried to drive on the up, with England now 55-4. 
Pope completed a 69-ball fifty but, with the very last delivery of the session, Nortje squared up Stokes to have the all-rounder caught by third slip Keegan Petersen for 20, leaving England on 100-5 at the interval. 
The tourists managed one more wicket in the short afternoon session as Ben Foakes (6) was bowled by a rampant Nortje. 
Pope was now batting with the tail, but rain spared England from further punishment at the hands of the Proteas pace attack, with only Lungi Ngidi yet to take a wicket. 
The match is the first of three Tests in the series, with fixtures also to be played at Old Trafford (Aug 25-29) and The Oval (Sept. 8-12).

7,Dubai airport gears up to handle World Cup supporters,"Gulf states have agreed to ease administrative procedures for fans in transit, in particular through the United Arab Emirates.","DUBAI: Dubai International Airport, a major aviation hub, is gearing up to help ease transit travel for World Cup supporters ahead of the tournament starting in November, its director said on Wednesday.
The first World Cup ever held in a Middle Eastern country is set to kick off in Qatar on November 20, and will last until December 18.
Gulf states have agreed to ease administrative procedures for fans in transit, in particular through the United Arab Emirates.
“We are actually putting together some immigration procedures which actually should make that transition between the two countries a lot easier,” Dubai Airports chief Paul Griffiths said.
He said online check-in will mean normal procedures can be bypassed  “and then you can get in and out very quickly”.
Pre-pandemic, Dubai was the world’s busiest airport for international passengers.
Without specifying figures, Griffiths said there would be  “quite a number of flights every day during the World Cup, ferrying fans to and from Doha”, the Qatari capital, following requests by several airlines.
He said he also expected many people to  “be going back and forth and enjoy their leisure time in Dubai and going back and forth just for the matches”.
Flights between the UAE and Qatar resumed in January last year after a diplomatic reconciliation ended a more than three-year boycott.
In 2017, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt severed relations with Qatar, accusing it of backing Islamist extremism.

8,Pakistan eye series-clinching victory against Dutch,The onus will be on Babar and first-game centurion Fakhar Zaman to be among the runs again.,"ROTTERDAM: After seeing his side edge the Netherlands by 16 runs in the opening One-day International of their three-game series, Pakistan captain Babar Azam admitted being concerned at times during the match in what he described as “tricky conditions”.
It was hardly a convincing win the bowlers failing to maintain their lines and lengths against the Dutch middle-order and Pakistan will look to put those things right in the second ODI and secure a series-clinching victory on Thursday.
The onus will be on Babar and first-game centurion Fakhar Zaman to be among the runs again, while opener Imam-ul-Haq and the middle-order would be expected to step up. The good thing for Pakistan, however, was that spin-bowling all-rounder Shadab Khan was among the runs in the first game and he would be expected to maintain consistency.
The Dutch, on the other hand, were poor with the ball in hand in the series-opener as they conceded a total well in excess of 300. Nonetheless, the batters showcased valiant performances with three half-centurions Vikramjit Singh, Tom Cooper, and Scott Edwards nearly doing the unthinkable.
Skipper Edwards remained at the crease right till the very end and scored an unbeaten 71 runs off 60 balls. He waged a lone war with hardly any support from the other end. His knock went in vain as the hosts were restricted to 298-8.
“We feel like more and more we are getting ourselves within reach of winning a few games but today we dropped two or three catches. We let ourselves down,” said Edwards after the match.

Although several stars, including batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, are being rested ahead of the Asia Cup in the UAE this month, the tourists are expected to win all three matches in Harare.
India are placed third behind leaders New Zealand and England in the ODI rankings, 10 places above Zimbabwe.
Under the guidance of 64-year-old former batting star Houghton, the southern Africa nation have won nine of 11 ODI and Twenty20 Internationals.
With Houghton in charge, hosts Zimbabwe beat non-Test teams Jersey, Singapore, the United States, Papua New Guinea and the Netherlands to qualify for the 2022 T20 World Cup.
Higher-ranked Bangladesh were expected to burst the bubble, but suffered shock 2-1 losses in both T20 and ODI series.
Pakistan-born batsman Sikandar Raza, whose childhood dream to be a fighter pilot was dashed by an eyesight glitch, played a key role in the ODI series with successive centuries. 
“He is a very good player who has been representing Zimbabwe with distinction for a long time,” said India vice-captain and opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan. 
“Sikandar is a quality cricketer with bat and ball. I am sure our bowlers will come up with nice plans against him.” 
Houghton said the unbeaten innings of 135 and 117 by the 36-year-old had a knock-on effect as they instilled confidence in his team-mates. “Playing alongside Sikandar, Innocent Kaia hit a century in his first ODI, then Regis Chakabva scored his first ODI ton with some brilliant shots.”
‘DESERVE WIDER RECOGNITION’
Former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop hailed the Raza tons, tweeting “The things that Sikandar Raza has been doing in recent weeks with the bat deserve wider recognition”.
Although missing Kohli and Sharma, Houghton says there is no such thing as a weak India cricket team. 
“They could pick four teams and then occupy the first four places in an international tournament. That is how good they are. 
“However, I told my boys that we dare not become mere spectators in this series while India play all the cricket. We must believe we can win. “The boys know they are far from invincible despite nine victories — we were 90-9 in our last ODI against Bangladesh before the tail-enders added 61 runs. 
“But if we continue to play without fear and express ourselves, we will succeed far more than we fail.” 
Houghton pinpointed poor batting starts as a concern, and vowed to “try and get higher scores from our top order”.
Opening batsman and wicket-keeper Chakabva skippers Zimbabwe in place of injured Craig Ervine on Thursday as the home team seek only a fifth ODI victory over India at home in 24 matches.
Injuries have also ruled out Blessing Muzarabani (thigh), Tendai Chatara (collarbone) and Wellington Masakadza (shoulder) while former captain Sean Williams is unavailable.
India had to make a late change to a 16-strong squad with all-rounder Shahbaz Ahmed coming in for Washington Sundar, who was injured playing English county cricket.
Opening batsman KL Rahul, a late inclusion after recovering from a hernia injury and testing positive for coronavirus, leads the tourists.
India squad: KL Rahul (captain) Shikhar Dhawan, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shubman Gill, Deepak Hooda, Rahul Tripathi, Ishan Kishan (wicket-keeper), Sanju Samson (wicket-keeper), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Avesh Khan, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Siraj, Deepak Chahar
Zimbabwe squad: Regis Chakabva (captain), Tanaka Chivanga, Bradley Evans, Luke Jongwe, Ryan Burl, Innocent Kaia, Kaitano Takudzwanashe, Clive Madande, Wesley Madhevere, Tadiwanashe Marumani, John Masara, Tony Munyonga, Richard Ngarava, Victor Nyauchi, Sikandar Raza, Milton Shumba, Donald Tiripano.

10,PSV rescue Rangers  draw as Obispo spares Benitez’s blushes,GLASGOW: Armando Obispo spared Walter Benitez’s blushes as PSV Eindhoven rescued a 2-2 draw against Rangers in the...,"GLASGOW: Armando Obispo spared Walter Benitez’s blushes as PSV Eindhoven rescued a 2-2 draw against Rangers in the Champions League play-off first leg on Tuesday.
PSV goalkeeper Benitez looked to have gifted Rangers the advantage when he allowed Tom Lawrence’s free-kick to squirm through his hands in the second half at Ibrox.
Benitez’s howler put Rangers 2-1 ahead after Antonio Colak had cancelled out Ibrahim Sangare’s opener for PSV.
But Obispo bailed out his team-mate with a priceless late leveller that leaves the tie on a knife-edge heading into next week’s second leg in Eindhoven.
Although PSV will be favourites on home turf, Rangers should still fancy their chances after staging a rousing comeback from 2-0 down to defeat Union Saint-Gilloise 3-0 in the third qualifying round.
Following on from that dramatic comeback, this was another tense European night for Rangers in their bid to return to the Champions League group stage.
Rangers last played in that round of the competition in 2010-11 before financial problems saw them drop into Scottish football’s bottom tier, from where they eventually returned to the top-flight.
They were knocked out of the Champions League qualifiers by Malmo last season, then enjoyed a memorable run to the Europa League final, only to lose to Eintracht Frankfurt in the final.
In a nod to Rangers’ European heritage, Ibrox legend John Greig was watching from the stands alongside former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.
But Giovanni van Bron­ckhorst’s team initially struggled to rise to the occasion on a rainy night in Glasgow.
“It was very close. The tie is open. PSV are an excellent team and they showed that. We still have the chance to go through,” Van Bronckhorst said.
Netherlands striker Luuk de Jong was inches away from giving PSV an early lead when he fired over from close-range.
Unable to shake off their lethargy, Rangers paid the price for some woeful defending in the 37th minute.
James Tavernier and Connor Goldson failed to clear a PSV corner, allowing Sangare to scoop his shot past Rangers keeper Jon McLaughlin from six yards.
Sangare’s goal served as a much-needed wake-up call for Rangers, who responded with an incisive raid to equalise just three minutes later.
Lawrence and Steven Davis ignited the move with one-touch passes to Tavernier on the right flank.
Croatia striker Colak had scored in his previous three Rangers appearances and the close-season signing was on target again as he met Tavernier’s cross with a clinical finish into the far corner.
Finally showing the same energy levels as their raucous fans, Rangers nearly took the lead just before half-time when Tavernier’s header forced a save from Benitez.
Van Bronckhorst was up against his former Netherlands team-mate Ruud van Nistelrooy, the former Manchester United striker in his first managerial role with PSV this season.
Van Nistelrooy’s men remained a threat and Ismael Saibari poked narrowly wide after Rangers made a hash of dealing with De Jong’s header.
Benitez made a complete mess of handling Lawrence’s 70th minute free-kick, which bounced out of his grasp and trickled over the line despite his desperate attempt to claw it back.
But Obispo silenced Ibrox in the 78th minute as he rose above Goldson to meet a corner with a towering header that flashed past McLaughlin.
“The better chances were for us in the second half but 2-2 is a fair result. Both teams are so balanced,” Van Nistelrooy said.
FC Copenhagen held off a fightback from visiting Trabzonspor to win their first leg 2-1.
Viktor Claesson gave the home team a first half lead.
Lukas Lerager added a second three minutes after half time, smashing the ball in from close range after a corner.
The Turkish champions responded by penning the Danes back, but struggled to break through. Their only goal was a 25-yard shot from Tasos Bakasetas that took a deflection off centre back David Khocholava with 11 minutes left.
In Norway, hosts Bodo/Glimt edged Dinamo Zagreb 1-0. Norwegian veteran Amahl Pellegrino headed in the only goal in the 37th minute.

11,"With defeat in Cincinnati, Serena running out of time to find form for US Open","CINCINNATI: Serena Williams’ farewell tour suffered another bump in the road on Tuesday with a 6-4, 6-0 opening...","CINCINNATI: Serena Williams’ farewell tour suffered another bump in the road on Tuesday with a 6-4, 6-0 opening round loss to Emma Raducanu at the Cincinnati Open, one of the last tune-up events before the final Grand Slam of the American great’s career. 
Serena has just one professional tournament remaining before the US Open, where she will have one last chance to tie Margaret Court’s record of 24 Grand Slam titles. 
The 40-year-old left the court swiftly after the defeat without speaking to television reporters and did not hold a press conference. 
Raducanu broke Serena at the start of both sets to claim victory in what was her first and likely last meeting with the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion, setting up a clash against two-time former major winner Victoria Azarenka. 
Serena’s elder sister Venus took a 7-5, 6-1 loss earlier in the day, losing to 2016 champion Karolina Pliskova. 
Naomi Osaka’s US Open preparations suffered another setback as the former world number one was swept aside 6-4, 7-5 by China’s Zhang Shuai. 
It was Osaka’s third tournament back from an Achilles’ tendon injury and it has been a stuttering return to action for the twice US Open champion, who also exited in the opening round in Toronto last week, retiring with lower back pain. 
Zhang next meets Russian Ekaterina Alexandrova, who beat Leylah Fernandez, the losing finalist at last year’s US Open, on Monday. 
American teenager Coco Gauff, runner-up at this year’s French Open, rolled her left ankle late in the first set of her match against qualifier Marie Bouzkova and eventually retired while trailing 7-5, 1-0. 
Amanda Anisimova withdrew from her match against fellow American Shelby Rogers due to a left ankle injury while second seed Anett Kontaveit progressed to the round of 16 after a rain-interrupted 3-6, 7-5, 6-4 win over qualifier Tereza Martincova. 
Joining her was France’s Caroline Garcia, who upset fourth seed Maria Sakkari 7-6 (7-2), 6-7 (6-8), 6-1 while Swiss Olympic champion Belinda Bencic lost 6-2, 6-7 (3-7), 6-4 to Romanian Sorana Cirstea. 
Two-time major winner Simona Halep, former French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko and former US Open runner-up Madison Keys also moved into the second round. 
MEDVEDEV BACK ON TRACK 
In the men’s draw of the joint event, Daniil Medvedev looked like he had a point to prove as the Russian got preparations for his US Open title defence back on track with a 6-4, 7-5 win over Botic van de Zandschulp in the second round. 
Medvedev had been building momentum ahead of the year’s last Grand Slam at Flushing Meadows by winning a tune-up event in Los Cabos without dropping a set but was beaten by Nick Kyrgios in the second round of the Canadian Masters in Montreal last week. 
Kyrgios began the last major US Open tune-up with a 7-5, 6-4 win over Alejandro Davidovich Fokina to reach the second round. He now faces good friend Taylor Fritz after the American crushed Sebastian Baez 6-1, 6-1. 
Elsewhere, Spanish third seed Carlos Alcaraz advanced in his tournament debut, defeating American Mackenzie McDonald 6-3, 6-2 to set up a third-round match-up against former US Open champion Marin Cilic, who beat Emil Ruusuvuori. 
Italian 10th seed Jannik Sinner celebrated his 21st birthday by beating Thanasi Kokkinakis 6-7 (9-11), 6-4, 7-6 (8-6). 
Argentine Diego Schwartzman also celebrated a birthday, his 30th, with a 7-6 (7-3), 3-6, 6-2 win over Aslan Karatsev in a late match to advance to the third round. 
In other first-round matches at the Masters 1000 tournament, Tommy Paul beat compatriot Jenson Brooksby 6-3, 6-2, Australia’s Alex de Minaur dispatched Swiss Henri Laaksonen 6-2, 6-2, Croatian Borna Coric defeated Lorenzo Musetti 7-6 (7-2), 6-3 and Spaniard Albert Ramos-Vinolas beat Italy’s Fabio Fognini 6-2, 6-3.
