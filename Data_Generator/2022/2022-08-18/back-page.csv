0,UK inks deal to return ‘criminals’ to Pakistan,"Legal expert says agreement will allow Britain to deport ‘unwanted persons’, even those who have no ties, to Pakistan.","LONDON: The UK signed a major deal with Pakistan on Wednesday, under which foreign criminals and immigration offenders from the UK can be returned to Pakistan.
UK Home Secretary Priti Patel hailed the development on Twitter, saying that “I’m proud to have signed a new landmark agreement with our Pakistani friends to return foreign criminals and immigration offenders from the UK to Pakistan. This deal shows our #NewPlanForImmigration in action, as we deliver for the British people”.

 





 
“I make no apology for removing dangerous foreign criminals and immigration offenders who have no right to remain in the UK. The British public have quite rightly had enough of people abusing our laws and gaming the system so we can’t remove them,” the statement quoted Ms Patel as saying.
“This agreement, which I am proud to have signed with our Pakistani friends, shows the New Plan for Immigration in action and the government delivering.”

Legal expert says agreement will allow Britain to deport ‘unwanted persons’, even those who have no ties, to Pakistan

“Our new Borders Act will go further and help end the cycle of last-minute claims and appeals that can delay removals.”
A statement from the Pakistani High Commission said: “The agreement renews and updates, in a bilateral context an earlier agreement between Pakistan and the European Community regarding readmission of persons residing without authorisation concluded in Oct 2009. The bilateral agreement was necessitated by the exit of the UK from the European Union.”
A photo tweeted with the announcement showed Ms Patel at a signing ceremony with Interior Secretary Yousaf Naseem Khokhar. A statement said the home secretary met with Mr Khokhar and the Pakistan High Commissioner to the UK, Moazzam Ahmad Khan, to sign the reciprocal agreement.
Under the new plan, Pakistani nationals with no legal right to remain in the UK, including criminals, failed asylum seekers and immigration offenders, will reportedly be removed.
The statement said Pakistan nationals make up the seventh largest number of foreign criminals in prisons in England and Wales totalling nearly 3pc of the foreign national offender population.
“The agreement underlines both countries’ ongoing commitment to tackling the issue of illegal migration and the significant threats it poses to both nations. The agreement also includes ongoing work to improve and expand UK-Pakistani law enforcement cooperation,” it said.
Bad news for Pakistan
Though Pakistan has demanded an extradition treaty with the UK for years, this agreement falls short of that. Some lawyers see it as a blow to Pakistan, which may now see an influx of deported criminals from the UK — even those who have never visited Pakistan.
“This is a very negative step for Pakistan,” UK-based immigration law expert Mohammad Amjad told Dawn. “Last year, the Pakistani government was presented with this deal and refused to sign it, because fundamentally it will allow serious criminals to be deported to Pakistan without critical information sharing. This will present huge problems for Pakistan.”
Mr Amjad cited the case of Sohail Ayaz, a convicted pedophile and child abuser who was deported to Pakistan from the UK, but exploited the absence of an information-sharing mechanism and continued his criminal activities in Pakistan. In 2019, he was arrested for the rape and assault of upto 30 minors, despite being convicted of similar offences by a UK court in 2008.
He said: “Such issues will increase. Some criminals may be deported who have no links to Pakistan, and they will pose an even greater threat as they have no family network once they are sent back. The only beneficiary is the UK.”
The deal with Pakistan came after deals were signed with Albania and India last year, as well as Serbia and Nigeria this year. Pakistan’s deal appears similar to the agreements signed with Albania, Serbia and Nigeria where illegal immigrants and criminal offenders will be removed from the UK.
The deal with India, however, was more of a migration partnership deal, which allowed young British and Indian nationals to work and live in each other’s countries.

1,German arrested for Hitler salute to Israeli athletes,Suspect arrested and banned from all further European Champion­ships events.,"MUNICH: A German security guard has been arrested for making a Hitler salute in front of a group of Israeli athletes visiting a memorial to the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, police said on Wednesday.
The 16 athletes from the Israeli European Cham­pionships team were visiting the Olympic Park in Munich on Tuesday evening when the banned gesture was made, police said in a statement.
“One of the four security guards present was observed at around 7:20pm making a National Socialist gesture (forbidden ‘Hitler salute’),” the statement said.
Police immediately arre­sted the suspect, a 19-year-old from Berlin, and he has been banned from all further European Champion­ships events.
The athletes themselves had not noticed the gesture, they said.
The arrest comes at a sensitive time, with Munich hosting the European Cham­pionships ahead of the 50th anniversary of the Olympics massacre, in which 11 Israelis were murdered.
On Sept 5, 1972, eight gunmen broke into the Israeli team’s flat at the Olympic village, shooting dead two and taking nine Israelis hostage, threatening to kill them unless 232 Palestinian prisoners were released.
West German police responded with a bungled rescue operation in which all nine hostages were killed, along with five of the eight hostage-takers and a police officer.
The families of those killed have received 4.5 million euros in compensation but say it is not enough and have vowed to boycott upcoming commemorations of the tragedy.

2,Shell Pakistan to stop aviation operations,"Oil marketing firm says it’s ""no longer commercially viable"" for it to run aviation business.","KARACHI: Shell Pakistan Ltd announced on Wednesday it’s going to discontinue its aviation operations across Pakistan.
In a regulatory filing to the Pakistan Stock Exchange, the oil marketing firm said it was “no longer commercially viable” for it to run the aviation business.
The company currently conducts its aviation-related operations at four locations: Karachi’s Jinnah Airport, Quetta International Airport, Sukkur’s Begum Nusrat Bhutto Airport and Nawabshah Airport.
Following the expiry of the leases related to these airports, the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) floated a joint tender for the operation of six airports, including Skardu International Airport and Gwadar International Airport.

Oil marketing firm says it’s ‘no longer commercially viable’ for it to run aviation business

“After due consideration of a wide range of factors, including legal compliance, financial and commercial considerations, Shell Pakistan has taken the decision not to participate in the tender,” it said, noting that the final date of exit from these airports will be communicated after consulting with the CAA.
However, “Shell Pakistan remains committed to continuing all its other businesses and operations in Pakistan, which remain unaffected,” the company said in its latest statement.
As per the last annual report of Shell Pakistan, it was the “second largest jet fuel supplier” in the country and catered to over 25 domestic and international customers.
Speaking to Dawn, Topline Securities Associate Director of Research Umair Naseer said fuel suppliers in Pakistan operate on low profit margins while striving for bigger volumes.
The dominant player in the country’s jet fuel market is Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd (PSO), with a share of 94.5 per cent in 2020-21, according to the state-owned oil marketing company.
The share of PSO is disproportionately high in the jet fuel segment given that its overall share in the oil marketing industry stands at 51.4pc.
Sales of jet fuel underwent a major decline following the pandemic-related curbs that limited international travel following March 2020. As a result, the jet fuel industry shrank 32.4pc in 2020-21 from the preceding year, with the business of PSO declining 32.2pc with the closing volume of 331.5 thousand tonnes, according to the oil marketing company.
In a blow to its already minuscule competitors, PSO also acquired new business in 2020-21 from international airlines and customers, including Virgin Atlantic, Pegasus Airlines, Istanbul Jet, British Airways, Air China, Air Sial and Air Falcon. It also exported jet fuel to cater to Nato/Isaf requirements.
“Oil marketing companies in Pakistan drive profitability on the back of inventory gains. Jet fuel is a very thin-margin segment,” said Mr Naseer.
Meanwhile, Shell Pakistan told stock market participants on Wednesday its net profit for the April-June quarter clocked in at Rs5.4 billion, up 26.8 times from the comparable period a year ago.
Its half-yearly profit amounted to Rs7.5bn after increasing 3.5 times from a year back.
A separate statement by the company released to the press said the turnaround was driven by improved business performance focusing on strategic priorities such as differentiated fuels and lubricants and a favourable change in the pricing formula to the pricing agency S&P Global Platts’ indexes by the government.

3,Soldier’s body found on Siachen after 38 years,Chander Shekhar was part of a 20-member group that got caught in an ice storm during a patrol.,"

NEW DELHI: The body of an Indian soldier who went missing 38 years ago on a glacier in Siachen has been found.
A unit of the Indian Army tweeted pictures of the coffin of Chander Shekhar wrapped in an Indian flag early on Wednesday, two days after India celebrated the 75th anniversary of independence.

 





 
The army said Shekhar was deployed for Operation Meghdoot in 1984 when India and Pakistan fought a brief battle to assert control over the Siachen Glacier, reputed to be the world’s highest battlefield.
At over 5,486 metres with temperatures that can plunge to minus 50 degrees Celsius, Siachen is one of the toughest military deployments in the world, located in the Himalayan region of Ladakh.
Local media reported that Shekhar was part of a 20-member group that got caught in an ice storm during a patrol. Fifteen bodies were recovered at the time, but the other five could not be found, among them Shekhar, the reports said.
His last rites will now be performed with full military honours in the state of Uttarakhand, where his family lives. His daughter, who was four years old when he went missing, said the family would now get closure.
“He has been long gone... Papa has come but I wish he was alive,” the Hindustan Times newspaper quoted her as saying.

Dispatchers sent officers to investigate a possible emergency after receiving a call on Saturday night that had disconnected.
Sheriff’s deputies in San Luis Obispo County traced the call to the offices of Zoo to You, a conservation park 320 kilometres north of Los Angeles, but couldn’t find any humans in trouble. Undeterred, and determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, they began to investigate.
“Then they all realised... it must have been Route the Capuchin monkey,” said a social media post by the sheriff’s office. “Apparently, Route had picked up the zoo’s cell phone... which was in the zoo’s golf cart... which is used to travel around the zoo’s 40-acre site.”
Capuchins are particularly inquisitive creatures who enjoy poking and pressing objects they pick up.
“And that’s what Route did... just so happened it was in the right combination of numbers to call us,” said the media post.

MAWLAWI Mahdi

 
KABUL: The Taliban’s lone Hazara Shia commander, who reportedly parted ways with the Islamic emirate a couple of months ago, was killed as he attempted to flee the country, the defence ministry said in a statement.
Mawlawi Mahdi Mujahid was shot dead by Taliban forces near the border with Iran, officials confirmed to Reuters on Wednesday, adding that he had rebelled against the de facto government.After the Taliban formed a government last year, Mahdi was given the post of intelligence chief in Bamiyan province. But months later, he was sacked following a dispute local media attributed to control of the lucrative coal trade. Mujahid went on the run in June after the Taliban sent thousands of troops to crush his loyalists.
The origins of the breach between Mahdi and the Taliban have not been made public, but as far back as June, the defence ministry had spoken of a clearance operation against rebels in northern Afghanistan.On Wednes­day, officials said border forces identified Mujahid in Herat province, near the frontier with Iran, and “punished him for his deeds”.
The defence ministry on Wednesday described Mahdi as a the “leader of the rebels” in a district in the northern province of Sar-e-Pul.
“He didn’t have anyone with him,” provincial information officer Naeemul Haq Haqqani told AFP, adding he was “killed after a conflict”.
Pictures circulating on social media, however, purported to show Mujahid alive and in custody. Haqqani dismissed those reports.
“Rumours that this person was captured alive are lies,” he said.
Mahdi’s appointment as a commander some years ago was touted as an example of the Taliban’s changed on stance on minorities. He was in the spotlight after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan in the wake of the pullout of western forces last year.
The Taliban are hardline followers of the Sunni branch of Islam, and were previously almost exclusively associated with the Pakhtun ethnicity. More recently, the group had sought to include members of other ethnicities. The Hazara, native to Afghanistan’s central mountains, are the country’s largest mainly Shia ethnic group.

7,US says no longer trusts Taliban,"Fact that senior members of Haqqani Taliban Network sheltered Zawahiri in Kabul has ""featured into thinking"", says Ned Price.","WASHINGTON: The United States has said that it no longer believes the Taliban are capable of implementing the pledges they made in Doha, Qatar, while signing a peace agreement with American negotiators.
At a Tuesday afternoon news briefing in Washington, State Department Spokesman Ned Price said that Al Qaeda leader Ayman al Zawahiri’s presence in Kabul “reinforces the idea that the Taliban heretofore has not been willing or able to comply with the commitments it’s made to its own people.”
In February 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed a peace agreement in Doha, Qatar, to bring an end to the 2001–2021 war in Afghanistan. The agreement ultimately led to the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan on Aug 15, 2021.
“The fact that senior members of the Haqqani Taliban Network were witting off Ayman al Zawahiri’s presence in Kabul and actively sheltered him, that of course has featured into our thinking,” Mr. Price said. “We’re still considering the implications of that.”
At the State Department briefing, a journalist pointed out that on July 27, US Special Representative for Afghanistan Tom West met a Taliban delegation in Tashkent.
Although by then, the US knew that Zawahiri was living in Kabul, under Taliban’s protection.
Mr. Price said that was the last face-to-face engagement that the United States has had with the Taliban.
“You can understand, I think, the secrecy with which those impending plans were held within the US government. It’s not something that we discussed with the Taliban, of course, beforehand,” Mr Price said.
