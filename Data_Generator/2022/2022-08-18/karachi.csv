0,Saadhay 14 August — a colourful show,KARACHI: It is difficult to describe or categorise renowned and popular writer Anwar Maqsood’s latest piece ...,"KARACHI: It is difficult to describe or categorise renowned and popular writer Anwar Maqsood’s latest piece written for the theatre, Saadhay 14 August, dubbed the last of the trilogy (Pawnay 14 August and Sawa 14 August), which held its special show for the media on Tuesday evening at the Arts Council of Pakistan. 
Is it a play? Well, it is, after all, it has characters in it. There is a plot… too. Is there a conflict in terms of creating tensions that keep the audience guessing about what’s going to happen next, the basic element that takes any story forward? Perhaps there is. Perhaps there isn’t. Perhaps Maqsood and his director Dawar Mehmood just wanted to give a good entertaining, full of fun, treat to their audiences, who are accustomed to the former’s guffaw-inducing one-liners. If that was the purpose, then Saadhay 14 August is high on the entertainment quotient. Anyone who needs a good, hearty laugh should go watch it. 
The reason for coming up with the above-raised argument is that at the heart of the script are the two respected political leaders Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah (played by Omar Kazi, whose hand must be tired from constantly lifting cigars and pipes to his mouth throughout the performance) and Gandhi (Tanveer Gill who did well and earned the most number of laughs but still needs to brush up on his Gujarati accent) that are asked to seek the opinion of the people on partition of the subcontinent after a case is filed against them for which they travel to four places — Kashmir, Lahore, Delhi and London. They are aided by an investigating officer (Jahanzeb Ali Shah) in their pursuit.  
Now you would expect that since Jinnah and Gandhi in one frame, the past must come to the fore in order to examine the journey that their respective leadership led the people to embark on. Instead, the focus, as is usually the case with Maqsood, is more on the present socio-political environment of India and Pakistan (more of Pakistan), again, highlighted through witty and humorous one-liners. It works fine. 
For example, when they are in Delhi, Gandhi and Jinnah see an item number being filmed or in Lahore they find themselves in the middle of a political showdown. That’s the set pattern of how the story moves throughout the production, relying on funny exchange of lines. Each shift in the backdrop (for which technology could have been used) is preceded by a large number of young girls and boys moving around the stage and in the aisles to the sound of music, creating a spectacle. There’s even a dance track thrown into the mix. A good recipe for a variety show! 
Drama originated in ancient Greece with a pair of masks used as symbols of two muses, Thalia and Melpomene. The first is the muse of comedy, the second of tragedy. On Tuesday evening, the muse of comedy was invoked. Could it be that the distinguished writer doesn’t associate tragedy with partition anymore?

1,Crumbling infrastructure exposing Karachiites to severe orthopaedic disorders,KARACHI: Healthcare professionals and medical science experts on Wednesday warned if the issue of the city’s...,"KARACHI: Healthcare professionals and medical science experts on Wednesday warned if the issue of the city’s deteriorating infrastructure was not addressed immediately, the growing complaints of chronic back pain, mainly among young bike riders, could become an epidemic among the Karachiites.
Citing recent data and study, they claimed the growing challenge of backache, damage to vertebrae and repetitive injuries to spinal cord among the Karachiites were not only affecting quality of life of the bike riders, but also affecting health of women, and in many cases they even had lost their pregnancies and gave premature births.
“The government needs to address this road infrastructure issue immediately before it’s too late,” Pak-American Arthritis Centre (PAAC) Managing Director Dr Saliha Ishaq told a news conference at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday.
“I am monitoring these cases very closely. I see that among more than 70 per cent of the people complaining back pain are those who are bike riders. They are mostly youngsters. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease, in which the immune system of a person attacks healthy cells in his or her body by mistake, causing inflammation (painful swelling) in the affected parts of the body. Rheumatoid arthritis mainly attacks the joints, usually many joints at once.”
Dr Tabe Rasool of the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) defined how the depleted roads, poor quality of two-wheelers and random speed breakers were directly causing the lifetime ailments mainly to riders.
“There are discs between human vertebrae,” he said. “Over these discs, there are blood vessels. The repetitive injuries due to these broken roads and infrastructures badly damage the vertebrae alignment which leads to different and serious issues, including severe pain which is commonly called Arq-un-Nisa and spinal cord arthritis. These repetitive injuries sometimes lead to lifetime issues. So it’s time to move now and there is a three-pronged strategy - fix the roads infrastructure, quality motorbike production and healthy lifestyle.”
The experts said not only the motorbikes, but even women who travel in rickshaws in Karachi are suffering from lower back pain due to strain and injuries they suffer on the broken roads of Karachi.
They urged authorities to launch an immediate drive to repair all the main and branch roads in the city to prevent young men and women from permanent disability due to dilapidated condition of roads in the megalopolis.
“We as health professionals are very much concerned, and to address this growing challenge from our end, we have launched a free telehealth service for all those who face these problems,” said renowned rheumatologist Dr Tahir Parveen. 
“At PAAC in collaboration with Ehad Medical Center (EMC), which is treating such patients at its 20 centres across Karachi, we have launched a UAN [021-111-113-423] where the patients with such complaints can get free consultancy. We guide them about the treatment and give them immediate possible remedies.”

Present at the launch of the Sindh Education Management Information System (SEMIS) were Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah, Reform Support Unit (RSU) chief Junaid Samo, Unicef education manager Venessa Lee and other important officers from the department. 
Sharing information about the SEMIS, Mr Samo said it would help them gather the annual census of Sindh’s 45,000 schools, including the student-teacher ratio, the school’s budget expenditure, etc. “These school performance indicators can lead to better planning,” he said.  
He said that on the basis of seven-year data, from 2015 to 2022, they had divided the SEMIS into three parts — collecting data, using it for planning and school clustering. He also informed that the running and managing of the SEMIS would be the responsibility of the RSU.  
The system is being financed through the European Union with technical assistance from Unicef.  
RSU’s research director Aftab Alam also added that they would be able to monitor the girls’ stipend prgramme, besides students’ attendance through the SEMIS.  
Speaking on the occasion, Education Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah said the SEMIS was the realisation of one of his dreams. “It will digitise all the information about each and every government school. And that will make it possible to access data with just one click,” he said. 
“It will make monitoring and profiling of schools so simple and easy as we learn of the condition of each school building, too, in real time,” he added.
The minister also said the Sindh government would keep the system accessible to people. “Anyone will be able to access this data and register his/ her opinion on its website,” he said.

Rainwater entered houses in low-lying localities in towns and over 200 villages in Kachho region and coastal belt in Thatta and Sujawal districts, inundating hundreds of acres of farmland and forcing a large population to shift to safe places, river banks and nearby towns.
In Khairpur, two women and a child were killed and two men were injured when the roof of their house collapsed on them during heavy rain in Luqman locality. The victims were identified as 18-year-old Salma, Farida and a-year-old Mohammad Usman.

Shah called on Palijo at his residence in Qasimabad to discuss arrangements for the Aug 21 public meeting of the Sindh Action Committee to protest against illegal immigrants’ influx into Sindh, according to a press release on Wednesday.  
Palijo said that foreign hands tried to destabilise Sindh’s peace and economy. Illegal immigrants were not only threatening the peace of Sindh, but also Pakistan’s economy, he added.  
He said that they were involved in terrorism, lawlessness and illegal drug trade, so they were direct threat to Sindh’s peace, harmony and tolerance. They were producing militant extremism, he observed.  
The two nationalist leaders said that the immigrants were undermining peace in the province. The Supreme Court had called for repatriation of immigrants to their parent countries, they said.  
They said there were special laws in the world to govern immigrants who lived under certain limitations in other countries.  
But in Pakistan and Sindh, the two leaders said, the immigrants were playing with the law of the land. There was 
hardly any city where drugs and narcotics were not sold and the immigrants were directly involved in that business.  
They said Pakistanis or other nationals were not given citizenship and right to own property in many countries. Only Sindh and Pakistan were offering such facilities, they said, warning that Sindh was not an orphanage.

9,‘Madhubala is finally freed from incredible pain’,Team of vets perform over five-hour-long surgery on one of  two elephants at Karachi Zoo.,"KARACHI: History was made at Karachi Zoo on Wednesday where Madhubala the elephant underwent a long and incredible surgery for her chronic tusk infection by an international team of experts. 
The operation was not only challenging for the vets, who had been preparing for the day for months and finally performed a complicated procedure through a unique method in the humid weather of Karachi. 
It was tough for 16-year-old Madhubala, too. The poor animal suffering from a painful inflammation and infection of the tusk for several years remained under ‘standing sedation’ for over six hours for the procedure.
“It was indeed a difficult operation both for us and the animal. We were expecting that the surgery would take two to three hours but it finally took five hours and 40 minutes,” Dr Aamir Khalil told Dawn.

Team of vets perform over five-hour-long surgery on one of  two elephants at Karachi Zoo

According to Dr Khalil, who is leading the Four Paws’ team, he hasn’t treated such a case before. “I have never seen something like this before. The tusk root was 45 centimetres long and completely rotten. That’s why the operation took so much time. We took it out in bits and pieces. There were a lot of pus and worms inside the wound.” 
“We were exhausted in the end but very happy and satisfied to see that the animal started moving and eating soon after regaining complete consciousness,” he said, while appreciating expertise of Dr Frank Goritz and Dr Thomas Hilderbrandt.
The team, including Dr Marina Ivanova, elephant trainer Mathias Otto and Agnieszka, is in Karachi these days to treat the four elephants housed in Karachi Zoo and Safari Park. 
The team had examined the animals and submitted a detailed report on elephants’ well-being to the Sindh High Court last year and had recommended immediate surgery for Madhubala and Noor Jahan, the two elephants kept at Karachi Zoo.
The tusks of both elephants were broken and the tissue inside the wounds was inflamed and infected. “Without treatment, the inflammation will expand and cause blindness or even brain damage and death,” Dr Khalil said.
A unique method
Instead of a traditional approach, the team used a less invasive, unique new technique that required less complicated aftercare, given the conditions at the zoo. And, the treatment under a ‘standing’ sedation which has been used to treat other animals [in the world], but never before elephants.” 
“We used specially designed drills and endodontic burs along with other dental instruments. During the procedure, the dead tissue was removed and the root canal cleaned,” Dr Ivanova said.
About Madhubala’s post-surgery care, she said it’s extremely important and the team’s trainer would teach local caretakers how to conduct regular post-treatment flushing and cleaning of the wounds to prevent further inflammation.
“Madhubala is finally freed from incredible pain. The medical treatment is an important step to improve her well-being and we expect good results for her recovery,” she said, adding that the vets’ recommended reunion of the all four elephants in Karachi at Safari Park once they recovered from the surgery.
Elephants Malika and Sonia at Safari Park suffer from cracked and overgrown nails and footpads and abscesses, which the team treated and gave aftercare instructions to the local team.

Students of Cambridge International AS and A Level already received their results last week on Aug 11 and now it is the turn of the younger O-level students. The exams were held in June.
The nervousness among the students was clear. They were wishing each other good luck on social media. If not that they were asking their followers to wish them luck as they aired their fears about not expecting good marks in one dreaded subject or the other. The reason was an understandable one: Covid-19. 
Like in the previous two years, the pandemic has been a cause of worry for all especially students.
But despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the exams went ahead in nearly all countries this year. And where the exams could not go ahead because of local Covid-19 restrictions, Cambridge International provided an alternative assessment, marked by Cambridge examiners. Cambridge also provided support to help students and teachers worldwide to adapt running of exams and other assessment to the disruption caused by Covid-19.
It is normal for students of O levels to decide whether they want to go for AS and A level after O level exams or to get into any of the local colleges for intermediate.

13,"Opposition leader Sheikh held, sent to prison after bail cancellation",He has been booked in a case pertaining to alleged illegal occupation of 40 acres of state land in Manghopir near Northern Bypass.,"KARACHI: The Anti-Encroachment Force arrested Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf after a court revoked his interim bail for ‘failing’ to join investigation in a land-grab case on Wednesday.
The Anti-Encroachment Force Zone-I had booked Mr Sheikh in a case pertaining to alleged illegal occupation of 40 acres of state land in Manghopir near Northern Bypass.
The lawmaker appeared before the Special Court Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) seeking confirmation of the interim pre-arrest bail granted to him against a surety of Rs100,000.
The investigating officer submitted a report in court stating that the PTI leader did not join the investigation after availing bail before arrest.
Judge Akhlaque Hussain Larik noted that Mr Sheikh was granted bail before arrest on June 22 with a direction to join the investigation, but when the matter came up for hearing on July 18, the IO informed that he had not yet joined the probe.
He said his lawyer requested time to comply with the court direction and the hearing was put off until Aug 4. However, the suspect did not appear in court and filed an application seeking to condone his absence, which was accepted and the hearing was adjourned till Aug 17.
The state counsel contended that the PTI MPA had disobeyed the direction of the court, rendering his bail application “liable to be dismissed” on this ground.
However, defence counsel Zahoor Mahsud submitted that his client had contacted the IO time and again to join the investigation, but he didn’t cooperate. 
He added that when Mr Sheikh went to the IO’s office to record his statement in the case, the latter was not available.
The judge noted: “It is hard to believe that the investigation officer did not mark attendance of the accused or he was not available when the accused appeared for joining the investigation.
“The accused could have moved a written application when he appeared for his statement before the investigation officer to prove his presence, even he could have captured a photo of his visit, but nothing was done,” the judge observed and ruled: “The accused had ample time to join the investigation, but he did not join the investigation, therefore, his application for confirmation of interim bail is dismissed.”
The court also cancelled the bail bond of the PTI leader and discharged his surety.
Following the dismissal of his bail, the officials of the anti-encroachment force took Mr Sheikh into custody.
Subsequently, the judge remanded him in judicial custody amidst tight security.
A case was registered under Sections 8(i) of the Special Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010 at the Anti-Encroachment Force Zone-I, Karachi, on behalf of the state.
