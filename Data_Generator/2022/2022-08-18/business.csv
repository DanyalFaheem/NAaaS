0,Govt commits more taxes as IMF board meets on 29th,Rs5 and Rs10 monthly PDL hike in diesel and petrol; no intervention in exchange rate; phaseout of Ehsas Ration Programme.,"• Rs5 and Rs10 monthly PDL hike in diesel and petrol
• No intervention in exchange rate
• Import reserve cover for 10 weeks
• Phaseout of Ehsas Ration Programme
ISLAMABAD: The government has given an undertaking to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to raise the petroleum development levy (PDL) to a maximum of Rs50 per litre each on petrol and diesel by January and April, respectively, in 2023.
In its Letter of Intent (LoI) sent to the IMF for formal approval of completion of the 7th and 8th reviews of the $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Pakistan has also made iron-clad commitments to build foreign exchange reserves to cover at least 10 weeks of imports by end of the current fiscal year from existing 5 weeks and not to use those reserves ever to support the exchange rate.
IMF Country Representatives Esther Perez Ruiz on Wednesday announced that the Fund’s Executive Board meeting for Pakistan’s combined seventh and eighth reviews under the EFF has been scheduled for Aug 29.
The government has also committed federal cabinet’s approval “of an implementation plan of monthly PDL increases of Rs10/litre for petrol and Rs5/litre for diesel on Sept 1, 2022, followed by increases of Rs5 per month for both fuels until the PDL reaches Rs50 in January for petrol and April for diesel” from the current rate of Rs20 per litre PDL on petrol and Rs10 on other three products – high-speed diesel, kerosene and light diesel oil.
Also, the government will phase out Ehsas Ration Riyat Programme during the fiscal year and continue with Sasta Fuel Sasta Diesel (SFSD) for now with clear sunset by June 2023.
However, the regular BISP would be expanded through Ehsas Emergency Cash and unconditional cash transfer programmes to Rs316bn this year to cover nine million families.
Under the LoI, the government would “remain committed to ensuring monetary and financial stability by maintaining a market-determined exchange rate, lowering inflation towards the target, and rebuilding foreign exchange reserves”. 
Over the next couple of months, the Ministry of Finance would seek about Rs150bn worth of fresh revenue measures to make up for some reversals in taxation and untargeted increase in expenditures.
The schedule of actions in this direction would be “continued commitment to a market-determined exchange rate and external stability”. The government reported that external conditions had become precarious in recent months, on the back of high uncertainty, a large terms-of-trade shock, and persistently large current account deficits.

The strong demand for foreign exchange from external debt repayments and imports put pressure on the exchange rate, which depreciated by over 33pc between end-December 2021 and end-July, while reserves have fallen to below 1.5 months of imports.
“In this context, we remain committed to the market-determined exchange rate, which has served as an essential buffer protecting economic activity and reserves during this prolonged period of heightened uncertainty, while supporting the smooth function of the market,” said the LoI, adding that State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) interventions will remain guided by market conditions and the objective of rebuilding reserve buffers to bring reserves up to a more prudent level of at least 2.2 months of import coverage by end-FY23 notwithstanding the difficult external environment.
“Forex sales will not be used to prevent a rupee depreciation trend driven by fundamentals,” the central bank and the Ministry of Finance have made a firm commitment. 
Moreover, the government would upgrade the Debt Management Office (DMO) which will be responsible for designing and implementing debt management strategy in line with World Bank and IMF. The strategy would consolidate fragmented functions of debt recommendations. With the amended Fiscal Responsibility and Debt Limitation Act (2005) management approved in May this year, the Finance Division has assigned the hiring of additional staff commensurate with the responsibilities.
The government is currently in the process of setting up the front office, middle and back offices of the new DMO to be completed by end-November 2022. Migration of relevant functions to DMO from other parts of government agencies has been already been completed in March 2022 and its coordination with other government units, particularly the Economic Affairs Division, was being improved to ensure the accurate compilation and reporting of debt-related statistics.
The government said Pakistan continued to face a challenging economic and political environment as while successfully navigating the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine has created uncertainty through higher international commodity prices and adverse external financing conditions. This has already resulted in higher inflation, elevated spreads, and wider current account deficit, while at the same time, the government changed on April 11.
It said the previous government granted a four-month relief package in February (including broad-based subsidies, fuel tax cuts, new tax exemptions and a tax amnesty), but added that the current government “recognise(d) that these actions are not-in and of themselves-conduciveto a sustainable macroeconomic environment and also run against some of Pakistan’s previous commitments under its IMF-supported programme”.
Hence to restore macroeconomic and external sustainability, the government committed and completed five prior actions, including revised budget 2023 approval, MoUs with provinces on provincial targets consistent with Rs750bn cash surplus target in the budget, complete reversal of the February relief package, comprising full elimination of general fuel subsidies and the Rs5/kWh blanket power subsidy in June and introduction of PDL on petrol at Rs10/litre and on diesel at Rs5/litre on July 1, and then doubling it on Aug 1, besides the tightening of monetary policy to 15pc.

In the value-added leather sector, exports of leather garments registered a negative growth of 22.85pc and leather gloves 14.51pc, respectively. The exports of raw leather also declined by over 4.66pc during the July.
Pakistan is one of the main suppliers of global surgical instruments. However, these instruments are re-marketed in western countries by famous brands. As a result, the export value of these products remains very negligible.
The export of surgical instruments posted a negative growth of 13.24pc in July 2022 over the same month last year. However, the exports of pharmaceutical products posted negative growth of 1.44pc during the month under review.

The government has proposed several measures in the budget for 2021-22, including a reduction in raw material duty to encourage the export of pharmaceutical, plastic, chemical, engineering, and value-added textile products.
Data compiled by the PBS showed the food basket posted a growth of 6.57pc in July compared to a year ago.
Under this category, exports of rice witnessed a paltry negative growth of 0.86pc year-on-year in July, mainly because of a drop in exports of basmati rice. The break-up showed that basmati exports in value decreased by 22.72pc and 35.96pc in quantity, while non-basmati exports were up by 15.09pc in value and 7.19pc in quantity. Spice exports fell by 10.61pc, followed by oilseeds, nuts, and fruits, all of which fell by 29.96pc.

2,Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry urges govt to cut fuel prices,FPCCI president says a drop in energy prices would curtail the cost of production and bring down commodity prices.,"KARACHI: Reacting to the latest fuel price hike, trade and industry leaders on Wednesday asked the government to pass on the relief of falling international energy prices coupled with rupee appreciation to the masses in the shape of a reduction in petrol and diesel rates.
Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Irfan Iqbal Sheikh said a drop in energy prices would curtail the cost of production and bring down commodity prices. 
In a statement, he said the rupee has appreciated by 12 per cent against the US dollar since July 28 and is likely to strengthen further after the release of the IMF tranche.
Mr Iqbal explained that international oil prices have fallen to the pre-February levels when the Russia-Ukraine war started and pushed the international oil prices to $139.13 per barrel on March 7. Now, the oil price hit $90 per barrel and the relief must be transferred immediately and in full.
While expressing serious concern over the Rs6.72 per litre hike in petrol rate despite a falling trend on the international market, FPCCI former president Mian Anjum Nisar urged the government to announce a price cut in petroleum prices to provide relief to the masses.  
He also stressed the need to keep the interest rate to a regionally competitive level.
He urged the federal government to reduce petrol and diesel prices without any delay.

3,MCB Bank profit falls 71pc,"KARACHI: MCB Bank Ltd recorded a net consolidated profit of Rs2.3 billion for the April-June quarter, down 71 per...","KARACHI: MCB Bank Ltd recorded a net consolidated profit of Rs2.3 billion for the April-June quarter, down 71 per cent from a year ago.
However, pre-tax profit for the same quarter increased 30pc on an annual basis to Rs18.1bn, a regulatory filing showed on Wednesday.
“The drag on overall profitability in the second quarter was on the back of higher taxation on account of revised corporate, advances-to-deposits ration–related tax and super tax,” said Arif Habib Ltd in a note to investors.
Along with the financial result, the bank also announced a dividend of Rs4 per share. It has already paid a dividend of Rs5 a piece.
Net interest income settled at Rs22.9bn in the quarter after increasing 31pc from a year ago. The interest expense remained “significantly high” — 82pc year-on-year — mainly due to the impact of policy rate hikes in the outgoing quarter, said the brokerage.
The provisioning expense for the bank stood at Rs71 million in the second quarter of 2022 versus a reversal of Rs1.8bn recorded in the same period a year ago.
The effective tax rate remained 87.3pc during the quarter under review as opposed to 43.7pc in the comparable three-month period a year back.
ABL profit falls 58pc: Allied Bank Ltd posted a net profit of Rs1.97bn for the April-June quarter, which is 58.5pc less than the earnings recorded in the comparable period of the preceding year.

The half-yearly profit of the commercial lender decreased 23.1pc year-on-year to Rs6.8bn. 
NBP income dips to Rs2.5bn: National Bank of Pakistan Ltd registered a net quarterly income of Rs2.5bn in the latest three-month period, down 72.5pc on an annual basis.
A stock notice on Wednesday showed an increase of 2.5 times in the tax expense dented the bank’s bottom line.
According to Topline Securities, the bank’s earnings were less than the street expectation because of lower “other income”.
The bank didn’t declare any payout.
Askari Bank earnings jump  98pc: Askari Bank Ltd posted net earnings of Rs2.7bn for the second quarter of 2022, up 98pc year-on-year, a stock notice said on Wednesday.
Profitability of the bank remained higher than market expectations, according to Topline Securities. Pre-tax quarterly profit increased 169pc to Rs6bn.
The bank recorded total profits of Rs6.3bn in the first six months of 2022, even though profit-before-tax grew at a higher rate. “This was primarily due to the levying of super tax on banking companies in the federal budget,” the brokerage said.
There was no announcement of a dividend.
BOP profit slips: Bank of Punjab Ltd said on Wednesday it recorded a net income of Rs3.2bn in April-June, down 12.2pc from a year ago.
The earnings announcement was better than analysts’ anticipation, thanks to higher exchange rate gains and reversals of provisions, according to Topline Securities.
The bank didn’t announce a dividend.
Engro income tumbles 87pc: Engro Corporation Ltd told shareholders on Wednesday its net profit for April-June clocked in at Rs1.9bn, down 86.6pc from a year ago.

Attock Cement posts loss: Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd told stock market participants on Wednesday it recorded a net loss of Rs59m in the fourth quarter of 2021-22 as opposed to a net profit of Rs149mn a year ago.
Arif Habib Ltd said the primary reason for the loss was the recognition of super tax and deferred tax liability.
Alongside with the result, the company also announced a dividend of Rs1.50 per share, which took the total payout in 2021-22 to Rs3.50 per share.
Honda prices slashed
After increasing the prices by Rs785,000 to Rs1.450 million in July, Honda Atlas Cars Ltd (HACL) on Wednesday reduced the price by Rs280,000 to Rs550,000 on different models.

4,Pakistan included in new UK trading scheme,"Under the new scheme, Pakistan will continue to benefit from duty-free exports to the United Kingdom.","ISLAMABAD: The United Kingdom (UK) has launched a “Developing Countries Trading Scheme” (DCTS), whose implementation in early 2023 will provide tariff reductions and simpler terms of trade to 65 countries, including Pakistan. 
The DCTS replaces the UK’s Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP), a preferential trading system that provides tariff removals and reductions on various products.
The British High Commission in Islamabad on Wednesday said that 94 per cent of goods exported from Pakistan will be eligible for duty-free access to the UK. Pakistan will save £120 million in tariffs on exports to the UK under the scheme.

 





 
Some of the specific goods that will benefit the most from the DCTS in Pakistan include over £250 million in average annual exports to the UK of bed linen and nearly £100m in jeans, both of which will receive a 12pc duty reduction.
Under the new scheme, Pakistan will continue to benefit from duty-free exports to the United Kingdom. UK International Trade Secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, launched the new scheme. The DCTS will remove tariffs on over 156 additional products, and it will also simplify some seasonal tariffs, meaning additional and simpler access for Pakistan’s exports to the UK.
The statistics released by the BHC show that the total trade, including goods and services, between the United Kingdom and Pakistan each year currently stands at £2.9bn.

5,Dollar snaps rupee’s rally after 11 sessions,Rupee falls by 0.46 per after gaining 11.62pc against the US dollar in the previous 11 working days.,"


 
KARACHI: The US dollar succeeded in gaining against the rupee after 11 working days, with a closing price of Rs214.88, according to the State Bank of Pakistan.
The rupee fell by 0.46 per cent on Wednesday after gaining 11.62pc against the US dollar in the previous 11 working days. 
The reverse trend, which helped the dollar to gain, was alarming for the currency market. The dollar fell from its peak of Rs239.5 to Rs213.90 during the current fiscal FY23, but currency experts have been warning that the rupee’s recovery was on the back of promises of dollar inflows from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources. 
Currency dealers believe the reversal trend will enable speculators to liquidate their holdings and book profits.
