0,CDA awaits govt approval to start charging fare for new metro bus services,"Civic body proposes fare of Rs50 for green, blue lines, up to Rs150 for orange line.","ISLAMABAD: Although the newly-introduced metro bus services in the capital have been operating for the last few months, the passengers are not being charged any fare as the Capital Development Authority (CDA) awaits a go-ahead from the federal government.
The CDA had sent a summary to the government, suggesting fare for the intra-city journey, but so far the civic body has not been informed about the fate of the proposal.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif inaugurated the Orange Line Metro in April, which plies from Peshawar Mor to Islamabad airport. He had ordered the CDA to provide free bus service to people for one month. On July 7, the prime minister also inaugurated the Green Line Metro (from Bhara Kahu to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences) and Blue Line Metro (from Koral to Pims) and ordered the civic body to run these services free for a month.
According to sources, last month, the CDA sent a summary to the interior ministry for getting approval of the fare rate from the federal government, however, the government has yet not taken any decision.

Civic body proposes fare of Rs50 for green, blue lines, up to Rs150 for orange line

In its summary, the CDA had proposed Rs50 for green and blue lines bus service and Rs50 for the Orange Line service and Rs100 from N-5 Station to airport which means that a passenger will pay Rs150 to travel from Peshawar Mor to the airport.
The CDA had hired services of a bus operator against Rs147 per kilometre for Orange Line service. The operator was also engaged to run the Green and Blue bus services on a temporary basis until a new contractor was hired.
A CDA official said further delay in approval of fare would put a burden on the CDA as the civic agency would have to pay to the contractor as per its agreement. He said that once the fare was approved, the burden of bearing expenditure on these bus services would reduce. 
He said for the Green and Blue services, work on bus stops was nearing completion and the CDA would also go for branding all stations to collect revenue.
Similarly, he said that four sites of petrol stations have already been earmarked along Kashmir Highway and regular earning of these stations will be spent on metro bus services to make it a sustainable project.
It is relevant to note here that on Independence Day, PM Sharif had directed the CDA to run inter-city bus service within one month’s time. Meanwhile, CDA with the help of National University of Sciences and Technology (Nust) recently started a study to identify potential routes for F, G, H and I series of sectors.
The capital city after GT Bus Service (which was abolished in early 90s) had no public bus service facility and on several occasions in the past, CDA made hollow announcements in this regard. However, no practical step was taken.
However, the government paid special focus on the bus service and in four months, three bus services have been made operational.
“Following the directives of the prime minister, we are working to launch inter-city bus service in one month,” said an officer of CDA.

1,FDE mulling over giving special attention to 180 exceptional students,ISLAMABAD: The Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) is mulling over paying attention to 180 most talented ninth ...,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) is mulling over paying attention to 180 most talented ninth and 10th graders so more students enrolled in its schools can secure positions in board exams. The directorate is planning to start extra classes for these students. 
The students of FDE-run schools hardly get the first position in matriculation exams conducted by the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE). This year, one student secured the third position in the exam. The schools are located in six sectors and each sector is being looked after by an area education officer (AEO).
An FDE official said a few days ago, its director general (DG), Dr Ikram Ali Malik, asked the AEOs to prepare students so that they could also secure top positions in the next exams.
The official said the AEOs had been directed to prepare a proposal about ways students could be taught well. Soon, the AEOs will share their input with the DG for making a formal decision in this regard.
The official said the directorate was mulling to identify 30 brilliant students from each sector, who after dismissal time in their respective schools, would be brought to centralised schools, where they would be given extra classes for four hours daily. They would also be provided free pick and drop service.
“Though a final decision in this regard will be made after a detailed meeting with AEOs, but yes, we are planning to give brilliant students special attention so they are able to get top positions,” the official said.
When asked about other students, he said that teachers have been paying special and equal attention to all students in all schools. 
However, as a special case, we are planning to focus on the most talented students to restore the lost glory of government-run schools. 
He said in the past until the early 90s, children of the elite class used to get education from FDE-run schools because these schools in that time were known for their quality of education.
The officer said that many of our former students have been serving in Islamabad’s bureaucracy, adding that with the passage of time however, the standard of education saw a decline. 
“Now, we are making efforts to bring improvement, recently we hired teachers purely on merit and focus is also being paid on teacher training,” he said.
The FDE is regulatory body of around 425 educational institutions of Islamabad. Five more new institutions will also start functioning next week.

2,Imran refuses to respond to FIA notice seeking bank accounts’ details,ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan has refused to respond to the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA)...,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan has refused to respond to the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) notice, in which it has sought details of bank accounts in the prohibited funding case.
The PTI chairman also warned FIA of legal action if notice was not withdrawn within two days.
The FIA had sought records from the PTI chairman regarding the total funds provided to the party by national and international companies and business firms.
The letter, sent to Deputy Director FIA Commercial Bank Circle Ms Amna Baig, through his lawyer Anwar Mansoor Khan, said the FIA does not have the authority to seek such details.
Mr Khan said that he was not answerable to her (Ms Baig) and was not bound to provide any information. Moreover, he warned that he would take legal action if FIA does not withdraw the notice within next two days.
He also challenged that asking for details and documents about political party was not the mandate of the investigation agency. He claimed that the ECP had issued a report regarding prohibited funding rather than a verdict. He claimed that the ECP was not authorised to order the FIA or any other agency.
The PTI chairman said according to the Political Parties Act 2002, FIA did not have the authority to take such action.
He even said that ECP was not a court or tribunal, as per decisions of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
Plantation drive 
Meanwhile, Imran Khan on Wednesday launched the monsoon tree plantation campaign by planting a sapling at Banigala, under which nearly 100 million saplings would be planted in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the monsoon season.
He in a special message urged the people that it was their national responsibility to plant trees for the better future of their children because climate changes badly impacted Pakistan due to which it was facing numerous challenges.
He said that around 1.4 million saplings had been planted on the occasion of Independence Day.
Imran Khan said that during the months of March and April, Pakistan experienced the hottest temperatures due to which alarming upsurge witnessed in the incidents of forest fires in Pakistan.
He went on to say that this year, the rains came prematurely in the country that triggered floods, wreaking havoc in various parts of the country.
“Due to climate change, glaciers had broken in three places in the northern regions, resulting in floods that caused severe destruction in the areas. I appeal to the nation to plant trees for the better future of our children,” he said.

4,Senate body for withdrawal of case against family of Shahbaz Gill’s driver,"Police raid on their house was grave violation of human rights, members say.","ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights on Wednesday condemned the arrest and proceedings against Saira Zafar, the wife of Shahbaz Gill’s driver Izharullah Khan, and her family.
The committee was of the view that a grave and serious violation of human rights had been committed and unanimously stressed on withdrawal of the case against them.
Committee members met under the chairmanship of Senator Walid Iqbal at the Parliament House to receive a briefing by the ministries of human rights and interior as well as the inspector general of police (Islamabad) on the application received from Malik Zafar Iqbal, father of Saira Zafar, regarding her arrest and the police raid on her house in the early hours of Thursday (Aug 11) purportedly in search of Dr Shahbaz Gill’s mobile phone and laptop.
A week ago, Saira Zafar was arrested for allegedly rioting and assaulting a police party.

Police raid on their house was grave violation of human rights, members say

IGP Akbar Nasir Khan said the bail application had been accepted and the court had granted bail to the suspect. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) had referred the matter to a sessions court for trial. A first information report (FIR) was registered against Saira Zafar and her brother Malik Noman Raza, charging them under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
One of the members asked the IGP under what provision of law could relatives of a person wanted for committing an offence, particularly the spouse and mother of a 10-month-old child, be arrested, to which Mr Khan responded by saying that no person could be arrested on the basis of their relationship, however, the police may arrest any person who was found to be involved in a criminal charge.
“Any person can be arrested if he or she was found to be involved in violation of law or a criminal offence and hence no constitutional violation had been committed by the local police while arresting the accused person as she had used criminal force while assaulting the police party and made obstruction in discharge of their lawful duty, which is considered an offence as per the PPC,” the IGP said.
The matter was under active investigation and had to be dealt with at an appropriate forum in an appropriate manner and would be dealt as per law, he added.
The committee chairman said the sole objective of the committee was to protect and safeguard the basic rights of the people irrespective of religion, caste or creed. He said “arrest and search” without warrant besides moving someone from one police station to another blindfolded and locking up without offence were grave violations of human rights.
Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed said the sanctity of the home and privacy of someone had been violated within the federal capital to search for a missing mobile phone which was condemned above party lines.
“Human rights committee is not about politics but about the people of Pakistan,” he said.
Senator Irfanul Haq Siddiqui said such actions should be based on equality and should not be person specific or party specific.
Senators Seemee Ezdi and Irfanul Haq Siddiqui recommended others that visits should be conducted to Adiala jail to inquire about the number of similar cases and hygiene of the jails.
The chairperson of National Commission of Human Rights (NCHR), Rabiya Javeri Agha, said 80pc of women in Pakistan were under trial including those who were mothers of infants. She said legislation should be formulated on bailable and non-bailable offences to save and protect the rights of women like Saira Zafar.
Minister for Human Rights Mian Riaz Hussain Pirzada condemned the arrest of Saira Zafar, adding that the proceedings should be withdrawn once the investigation was completed and she was proved innocent.

5,PM asked to take notice of promotions in Drap,Young pharmacists term promotions illegal as officers failed to participate in mandatory course...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Young Pharmacist Association (PYPA) has urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to take notice of promotion of 13 officers of the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) who did not participate in mandatory management course.
The body alleged that the Drap used the powers of the Parliament and also violated the orders of the apex court.
The letter, available with Dawn and copies of which have been sent to 11 other offices, stated that as many as 13 officers of Drap have been promoted from BS-18 to BS-19 without qualifying mandatory management course. “The method of promotion for director has been prescribed wherein it has been specifically mentioned that Drap officers, employees and Civil Servants working in Drap would have to complete customized courses . . . . Therefore, the appellant is not justified in claiming exemption from customized training. 

Young pharmacists term promotions illegal as officers failed to participate in mandatory course

The Judgment of FST dated July 11, 2009 is not relevant in the instant case, as the situation has changed after the promulgation of Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan Act 2012. . . ..,” the judgement stated.
“Keeping in view the above, the appeal having no force of merits is hereby rejected. Since the main appeal is rejected, therefore, the MP is also disposed of accordingly,” it stated.
PYPA has stated that the Judgment of FST was further upheld by Supreme Court vide C.P No.2325 of 2019 titled Dr Noor Mohammad Shah vs Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of NHS, Local Government and Rural Development Complex, Islamabad.
“This is also clear from the reply of Drap through its Director (Admin, HR and Log) in the above case in FST, that no promotion shall be granted to any officer without management course; herein, Ministry of Health has been devolved to Provinces; and Drap is a new department/authority established under a new ministry after 18th Amendment in the Constitution,” it stated.
General Secretary PYPA Dr. Furqan Ibrahim, while talking to Dawn, said that during the case of Dr Noor Mohammad Shah, Drap informed the court that employees cannot be promoted without qualifying mandatory management course. 
Later Mr Shah contacted Supreme Court but failed to get a decision to be promoted without qualifying management course.
“As court had agreed to the stance of Drap so now only parliament can allow the officers of Drap to be promoted without qualifying mandatory management course. However, recently Drap got a decision from its policy board that officers can be promoted without qualifying mandatory management course. 
The letter suggested reverting all officers who were promoted in next scales without qualifying the management course and recovering all additional salaries drawn by them. It also suggested starting criminal proceeding against all members of Policy Board who made illegal decisions.

She was speaking during the ‘Leaders in Islamabad Business Summit 2022’ on the topic ‘Climate Change and Way Forward for Pakistan’.
Taking the floor at the summit, Ms Rehman said: “Seeing the country ravaged with climate catastrophes in the form of long, disastrous monsoon spells, unbearable heat waves and apocalyptic flash floods make it all the more relevant for us to talk about how climate change and its environmental impact will directly affect businesses, society, and ecosystems.”
She said Balochistan alone faced 605pc of rain this year on a 30-year average, leading to damages to life and property. All these changes had made Pakistan the ground zero of climate catastrophe, she added.
Damage to agricultural productivity, livelihood, human health and economic stability had led to irreversible impacts, including gross domestic product (GDP) losses of 9.1pc, she said, adding that, “Until recently, a large number of companies, unfortunately, have freely emitted carbon, dumped effluent in our water bodies, and increased single-use plastic production. We will face disastrous consequences if we keep up with these practices.”
Highlighting the lack of global climate action, the minister said Pakistan would now have to look at its own climate solutions since the global leadership was well behind the curve on climate targets.
“The pledges are not matched by processes and ambitions are not matched by actions. The pace of climate change and its impacts are far more accelerated than the benchmark of 2050 set by world leaders at COPs. Notwithstanding mitigation, which is not a goal to be lost sight of, we are shifting our focus to building a National Adaptation Plan to face climate disasters and create resilience,” she said.
Ms Rehman said countries were enhancing their climate literacy and seeking to decarbonise their production cycle.
“We have to reset priorities to level up our resources and face climate disasters head-on. The provinces, too, will need to scale up. Our ambit is to provide them with policy guidelines. We need to build green technology and goals, and we would appreciate initiatives from tech companies,” she said, adding that, “companies with innovations and technology to help in dealing with the climate crisis are welcomed and should come forward”.

9,Azad Kashmir PM ousts minister from cabinet,"Gujjar removed for “constant violations of the code of conduct, party policy and the Rules of Business”, handout says...","

Chaudhry Maqbool Ahmed Gujjar

 
MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas on Wednesday removed Chaudhry Maqbool Ahmed Gujjar from his cabinet reportedly because of his “indecorous attitude and misconduct”.
“In exercise of the powers conferred on him under Article 14(3) of the Constitution, the Prime Minister has removed Mr Maqbool Ahmed [Gujjar], Minister for Industry, Commerce, Labour Welfare, Sericulture and Printing Press with immediate effect,” read a notification issued by the AJK Services and General Administration Department (S&GAD).
Mr Gujjar, who had returned from LA-35, Jammu-II, one of the 12 constituencies of Kashmiri migrants in Pakistan, was adviser for industry and commerce in the previous Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi-led PTI government. However, in April this year, PM Ilyas had appointed him as minister with the same portfolios.
Though the S&GAD notification was silent about the reason behind Mr Gujjar’s unceremonious dismissal, an AJK Press Information Department handoutstated that the prime minister had removed him for “constant violations of the code of conduct, party policy and the Rules of Business”.

Gujjar removed for “constant violations of the code of conduct, party policy and the Rules of Business”, handout says

“Chaudhry Maqbool Gujjar was time and again warned by the party leadership and government to mend his ways but to no avail… He did not stop his actions against the rules which was why he was ousted from the cabinet today,” added the handout.
Last month, Mr Gujjar had hit the headlines after the PML-N led Punjab government hadbarred him and former federal minister Ali Amin Gandapur from entering the province from July 15 to July 18 over a concern that they might cause unrest during by-elections on July 17.
However, Mr Gujjar had defied the ban. He was escorted by the police out of the city from where his real cousin was contesting elections as PTI nominee.
Sources in the AJK government said Mr Gujjar had misbehaved with PM Ilyas at a recent cabinet meeting, hurling an indecent 
comment on the latter. However, both had reconciled the same evening.
On August 13, when the government had presented the 15thconstitutional amendment bill with the full support of the opposition PPP and PML-N, envisaging the establishment of a separate election commission for local bodies (LB), Mr Gujjar had expressed his disagreement with the move through some satirical remarks in the house.
Talking to Dawn from Islamabad on Wednesday, Mr Gujjar asserted that he had been removed from the cabinet for his “unequivocal standpoint against the moves aimed at holding the long overdue LB polls in abeyance”.
“Ironically, all these major political parties - PPP, PTI, PML-N or Muslim Conference - are unanimous about not holding the LB polls. From their body language, I do not see any signs of these polls in near future,” he said.
Mr Gujjar, a former [Sialkot] district council member and twice elected town nazim of Pasrur, said he had contested LB elections in Punjab because of his “firm belief in the utility of local government system that serves as a nursery for new leadership.”
“Since it’s also in accordance with the vision of our leader Imran Khan, I am therefore averse to any move in Azad Kashmir that derails LB elections,” he added.
He said he had sought an appointment with the PTI chief for Thursday to apprise him of his concerns in this regard.
