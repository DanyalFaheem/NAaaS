0,Flour shortage hits public hard in Punjab,LAHORE: A crackdown was launched on flour mill owners in the province on the direction of Punjab Food Secretary ...,"LAHORE: A crackdown was launched on flour mill owners in the province on the direction of Punjab Food Secretary Nadir Chattha.
Deputy Director Food Umair Sagheer in Multan arrested a mill owner for blackmarketing the flour and also recovered hundreds of tonnes of wheat and flour from their custody.
The deputy director recovered 200 bags of flour from a warehouse on Bosan Road, and 900 bags of wheat and flour from the mill.
Punjab is facing a shortage of 4,000 tonnes of flour on a daily basis while flour mills are charging heavily.
The wheat shortage started increasing after the heavy floods in the southern part of the province as the wheat stored in the house of southern Punjab washed away.
The government provides 18,000 tonnes of wheat to private millers on a daily basis in the province but 22,000 tons of wheat is required in the province.
The current political situation is also increasing the problem for the people as the province had demanded 22,000 tonnes of wheat per day but the summary is pending in the federal cabinet for approval.
Private millers are short of wheat due to the severe floods in southern parts of the province as the demand for flour increased all over the province. The government is providing 18,000 tons of wheat to the market at Rs2,300 per maund. However, the flour millers sell flour at exuberant rates.
The difference in the price of the flour was also creating problems for the people of the province and they would have to buy flour by paying heavy charges due to shortage.
The government also has purchased 500,000 tonnes of wheat to address the shortage but 115,000 tonnes have been received to date. The remaining 385,000 tonnes of wheat would have yet to arrive in the country to address the shortage.

1,Shortage forces public hospitals in Lahore to deny free insulin to patients,Officials blame it on contractor.,"LAHORE: Following the persisting shortage of insulin in the private market, some state-run hospitals of the city have started refusing to provide the essential hormone/drug to the registered diabetes patients free of cost.
Since it usually costs around Rs1,000 per week, most of the poor patients are unable to afford insulin now a days due to its sale on higher rates in the black market.
An official says major teaching hospitals of the city, including the Jinnah, Mayo, Services, General and Sir Ganga Ram hospitals had registered poor patients under a programme to provide them with their monthly doses of insulin free of cost.

Officials blame it on contractor

Of these healthcare facilities, he says, only the LGH has managed to restore official supply of insulin to the patients, taking some emergent measures, while those registered with the Jinnah, Mayo and the Services Hospital Lahore are facing hardships in getting free insulin.
He says the delay in administering the prescribed doses of insulin daily could cause serious complications among the patients who are advised strictly by the doctors to get their shots on time to avoid health risks.
The registered number of patients with diabetes at the Out Patient Department (OPD) of the Jinnah Hospital Lahore is said to be more than 500, he adds. 
The official says as the insulin has been in short supply for a month, Jinnah Hospital was providing it only to select patients, refusing the others. However, the situation worsened around a fortnight back when the hospital ran out of stock.
When asked about the reason for the suspension of supply, the officials says the company which had been awarded contract failed to ensure uninterrupted provision to the hospital that is now short of Insulin R, Insulin N and Humulin (70/30).
Quoting some medics, he says that Humulin R is human (hormone) insulin that is used to control high levels of glucose in blood of adults and children with diabetes mellitus, while Humulin N is a man-made form of the hormone used to treat the symptoms of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
He says some of the poor patients have been prescribed 40 units of the insulin twice a day and they were finding it hard to get the doses due to its unavailability.
Because of the shortage, he says the doctors at indoor departments of the Jinnah Hospital Lahore are forced to suggest the admitted patients to get insulin from the market.
Jinnah Hospital Medical Superintendent (MS) Dr Amjad Mahmood says the contract for supply of insulin had already been awarded to a company, and he would sort out the matter to ensure supply to the OPD patients.
A senior doctor at the LGH Diabetes Centre says the institute faced some issues in provision of insulin to the patients uninterruptedly a month back due to the delay in issuance of clearance certificate by the Drug Testing Lab. “However, the matter has been resolved and the patients began to get insulin”, claims Dr Salman Shakeel. He says that presently 3,000 diabetes patients are registered with the hospital.
The officials say the Mayo Hospital is partially providing insulin to the registered patients.

3,Sana warns Punjab rulers against stalling no-trust vote,"Zardari, Shujaat discuss candidate for CM’s office post no-trust vote.","LAHORE: In the face of the Punjab Assembly speaker’s intention not to comply with the governor’s directive requiring Chief Minister Parvez Elahi to obtain a vote of confidence from the house, the interior minister has claimed if the order isn’t followed through the governor may notify the CM ceasing to hold office.  
On the other hand, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) continued its consultations on the future of the provincial legislature with PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari calling on PML-Q President Chaudhry Shujaat for the second time since Sunday.  
After a meeting at the Governor House here, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah has warned if Elahi did not obtain a vote of confidence on Wednesday (today), he would cease to be the chief executive of the province.  
“The Punjab Assembly speaker’s stance that the assembly is in session, so the CM cannot be asked to obtain a vote of confidence is wrong. If Mr Elahi fails to do so, he will cease to be the CM,” he maintained.  

Zardari, Shujaat discuss candidate for CM’s office post no-trust vote

The meeting was also attended by Governor Baligur Rehman, federal ministers Tariq Bashir Cheema and Saad Rafique, and special assistants to the premier Aun Chaudhry and Malik Ahmad Khan. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also attended the meeting via a video link from Islamabad and discussed the party’s strategy to ‘save’ the assembly. 
Mr Sanaullah said the governor would issue an order barring the chief minister from holding the office in case he did not get a vote of confidence by Wednesday afternoon. He further said Mr Elahi had claimed he and 99 per cent of the MPAs did not want dissolution of the PA on the ‘wish’ of one person (Imran Khan).  
“Parvez Elahi will have to explain that if he is not in favour of dissolution of the assembly then why he is doing so. [Imran Khan] wants to trigger crises in Punjab. The nation and the institutions agree that this man should be stopped from committing the senseless act,” he said.  
The minister, who is also the PML-N’s Punjab president, said the governor would call for election of the chief minister in case Mr Elahi failed to secure a vote of confidence. To a question about the PDM’s contacts with the PML-Q regarding about nominating a candidate of the alliance for the CM’s office, he said: “All allies are in touch in this regard,” he added.  
When asked whether the federal coalition tried to woo Elahi, PM’s Special Assistant Malik Ahmad Khan said: “Parvez Elahi has declared that he is with the PTI.”  
When asked if Mr Khan’s name was being floated as the CM candidate of the coalition, he said his “conscious effort for this position is only for Hamza Shehbaz”.  
Mr Hamza, the opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly, is currently in London with his uncle Nawaz Sharif. “In case the PTI-PML-Q decides to take up the no-trust motion against the CM, Hamza will have to rush back,” a PML-N lawmaker told Dawn.  
When asked why Hamza was even away at a time when his party needed him here the most, the lawmaker said: “Hamza does not have anything to do regarding efforts to woo the PML-Q MPAs or holding talks with Mr Elahi. PPP’s Asif Zardari and PML-Q’s Chaudhry Shujaat have been tasked with this important job.”  
‘Sought after’ PML-Q MPAs 
Meanwhile, the federal ruling alliance has its eyes set on the 10 PML-Q lawmakers in Punjab as the tally – in case the no-confidence resolution is taken up -- may swing in its favour if at least seven of the MPAs are ‘persuaded’ to change their loyalties.  
According to a party insider, both Mr Zardari and Chaudhry Shujaat have been working on these lines.  
Moreover, with speculations rife that the PDM is making efforts to make CM Elahi switch sides, his son and PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi called on Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Tuesday and vowed to stand with him. 
“Held a meeting with Imran Khan and finalised a strategy to dissolve the Punjab Assembly. No matter how much effort the PDM makes, it cannot stop early elections. In the coming elections, victory is for Imran Khan,” Moonis tweeted. 
In response to another tweet about the PDM’s ‘offers’ to Mr Elahi, Moonis said: “Not interested…absolutely not.”  
PPP-PML-Q parleys 
Separately, former president Zardari met Chaudhry Shujaat as part of their consultations on the future of the Punjab Assembly.  
PM’s Special Assistant Mr Khan briefed the two leaders about the constitutional and legal intricacies of the governor’s order to CM Elahi to seek a vote of confidence and the opposition’s no-confidence motion against the CM. 
Federal ministers Salik Hussain and Tariq Bashir Cheema of the PML-Q as well as Sindh minister Nasir Hussain Shah were also present during the huddle.  
Sources said the PPP also planned to introduce its candidate for the CM’s slot in case efforts failed to dissuade Mr Elahi from dissolving the assembly and to join the PDM. Mr Zardari discussed with Shujaat if the PML-Q would support the move that was reportedly backed by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, who has already withdrawn his nephew Hamza from the race to the CM’s office by calling him to London a few days ago.  
Sources privy to the development said although a couple of members of the ‘House of Sharif’ wished to control the province as de facto rulers by nominating a PML-N member for the office, the PPP is trying to present Makhdoom Usman, a son of former Punjab governor Makhdoom Ahmed Mahmood, as a better alternative.  
MPA Ali Haider Gilani, a son of former premier Yousaf Raza Gilani, and PPP Punjab General Secretary Hassan Murtaza are also being considered dark horses in the race.

5,Centre to provide railways with Rs14bn to rehabilitate infrastructure,SOPs issued for train operations in foggy conditions.,"LAHORE: The federal government has pledged to provide Rs14bn to the Pakistan Railways (PR) for rehabilitation of its infrastructure massively damaged by the devastating floods in Balochistan.  
The funds will only be utilised for rehabilitation of the rail infrastructure in Balochistan alone, according to Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique.  
“The federal government will provide a financial aid of Rs14bn to the PR for the repair/rehabilitation of rail infrastructure. These funds will be limited to be used for Balochistan,” the minister said while presiding over a meeting on Thursday.  
The railways had, on Aug 21, suspended its train operations at various sections, mostly in Balochistan and Sindh, after the flash floods washed away the tracks in the provinces. The situation had forced the authorities to cancel or delay departure of various trains also, according to official sources. The Jaffar Express’s operation had also been squeezed to Sibi from Sukkur while the same strategy was also adopted at other sections affected by floods.   

SOPs issued for train operations in foggy conditions

The train operations remained suspended during the second week of August at Narowal-Sialkot section after the Nullah Dek overflowed and washed away the railway line. However, the authorities resumed the operation after rehabilitating the affected track within a couple of days. On Nov 21—three months after the floods in Balochistan, the railways succeeded in restoring train operations linking the province with Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Jaffar Express became the first train to leave the Mach Railway Station carrying 261 passengers.  
The participants in the meeting discussed various issues and also took decisions in this regard. It approved a proposal seeking stoppage of all trains at major railway stations up to five minutes to ease passengers in leaving and catching trains comfortably. It allowed the railways authorities to attach power and luggage vans at the end or start of the rake after the locomotive.  
The minister directed the authorities to allow attaching additional coaches on weekends with the trains running between Lahore-Rawalpindi sections. He asked the officers to submit the PR Lahore Headquarters’ restoration plan on a war-footing basis. Mr Rafique also directed the officers to launch a massive crackdown on the encroachers in the Karachi division.  
The participants also reviewed composition, income, expenses and stoppages of Mehr, Badar, Ravi, Sir Syed, Ghauri and Thal express trains.  
On the other hand, the PR (Lahore Division) issued on Tuesday the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the train operations in foggy weather.  
According to the SOPs issued by the Divisional Transportation Officer (DTO) Ammara Sammi, the drivers, guards, cabin men and station masters have been asked to act wisely and vigilantly in foggy weather. They, especially the drivers, have been directed to slow down the trains’ speed in dense fog and keep eyes on the signals. Under the SOPs, the staff concerned has been directed to keep the locomotive headlights, inner lights and buffer-side lights operational. The public at large has been asked to use authorised passages to cross the railway lines.  
Moreover, the PR Police on Tuesday arrested two suspects stealing the rail material at the Mughalpura workshop. According to a spokesman, the accused were arrested by the patrol police officials.  
Meanwhile, the railway drivers called off the strike call after the railway authorities transferred half of the salaries to their account.  
“We had announced to stop trains in a strike from Tuesday. But we called it off after we received half of the salaries in our accounts. Rest of the salaries would be transferred on Wednesday (today),” said Karim Bakhash, an office-bearer of the PR train drivers association while talking to Dawn on Tuesday.

6,"Exhibition of Ghalib’s letters, memorabilia from 27th","LAHORE: First of its kind in Lahore, an exhibition featuring the greatest Urdu poet Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib’s...","


 
LAHORE: First of its kind in Lahore, an exhibition featuring the greatest Urdu poet Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib’s letters, commemorative stamps and other documents related to him and masters’ artworks on him by maestros will open at the Lahore Museum on Dec 27. 
The exhibition is being held in connection with the 225th birth anniversary celebrations of Ghalib. 
Born on Dec 27, 1797, in Agra, he settled in Dilli (Delhi) at the age of 13 and spent his life there.  
Ghalib witnessed the decline of the Mughal Empire and the rise of the British. The War of Independence 1857 had a great impact on him and it was reflected in his epistolary. 
Ghalib was Ustaad (teacher) of the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar for some period. Zafar bestowed upon him the titles of Najm-ud-Daula (Star of the State) and Dabir-ul-Mulk (Secretary of the State).  
Ghalib had to face a financial crisis with the advent of the British. His family pension was withheld and could not be fully restored irrespective of his multiple petitions to the British government. One of his petitions for the pension recovery forms part of a record of the Punjab Archives and its facsimile is displayed in this exhibition. 
Ghalib has a great impact on letter writing and epistolary as he claimed, “he transformed letter into a dialogue”. His letters are free from long and tortuous salutations and formalities. The letters depict his personality and the conditions surrounding him.  
Ghalib’s bubbling wit and keen sense of humour targeting himself and his problems made these letters fine examples of humour in prose. Nine of his letters would be displayed in the exhibition out of the Lahore Museum collection. 
Iffat Azeem, the research officer at Lahore Museum, told Dawn Ghalib’s poetry and imagination had inspired the artists to explore new ways of creation.  
Abdur Rahman Chughtai, Sadequain and Aslam Kamal have painted Ghalib’s couplets and quatrains in calligraphic paintings. “There would be paintings, calligraphy and commemorative stamps in the exhibition relating to Ghalib.  
Ms Azeem said the Lahore Museum was indebted to the Archives Department of the Punjab government, Government College University and Aslam Kamal for provision of the material for holding the exhibition.

PPP and the PTI – and backed these parties to bring them into power.
Talking to journalists after addressing a “Seerat Conference” at Wahdat Road Science College on Tuesday, he said the former army chief first nurtured the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and later extended support to the PDM government.
He said the ruling parties had always been relying on the establishment’s support to come into power. “Those who got the [establishment’s] support were glad to have it, and those denied started crying,” he added.
He said the JI sought an end to the establishment’s role in the country’s politics. 
The elections, he said, should be held after electoral reforms. He said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should be powerful both financially and administratively, and free of influence of the judiciary, civil and military bureaucracy, police and powerful individuals.  
He said the elections without reforms would open a new Pandora’s box as nobody would accept the results. He said the JI wanted the elections should be held on the principle of proportional representation.
Mr Haq called for a strict and impartial accountability system in the country and demanded that first of all those who considered themselves among the top ten leaders of the country should be held accountable of their deeds.  
He said as the PDM, the PPP and the PTI troika were equally responsible for the country’s problems, so accountability of their leaders was need of the hour.  
To another question, he said the masses were witness to the “joke” being played in the name of the no-trust movement in Punjab. He said the drama had been continuing for months with mutual understanding of the ruling parties, who had “nothing to do with the welfare of the people.”
He said the people of Pakistan had to decide now whether they agreed to live with the same corrupt system or wanted a “real change”. He urged the masses to send the tried and tested parties packing and vote for the JI for a “corruption free and Islamic Pakistan”.

10,Ban on Joyland: LHC directs information secy to decide matter within 15 days,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday directed the provincial secretary for information and culture to hear the...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday directed the provincial secretary for information and culture to hear the point of view of petitioners and producers of Joyland and decide the matter relating to ban on the exhibition of the film within 15 days.
Hearing the petitions by citizens and the producers, Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabbir expressed displeasure over the inaction of the Punjab government in relation to the interim order passed on Nov 17 through which the government had suspended Punjab Censor Board’s certificate granted for screening of the film Joyland in the province.
The judge questioned as to why the interim order was still in operation and the government had still not heard the petitioners, including the producers and the distributors of the film who were aggrieved by the impugned decision.
On behalf of the petitioners, Advocate Usama Khawar Ghumman apprised the court that fundamental rights of the petitioners were at stake, particularly, the freedom of expression and speech, and right to trade and business.  
He said the impugned decision of the government did not even fulfill legal requirements to constitute a valid executive action. The requirements mainly include an inquiry and an approval nod by the provincial cabinet, he said.
The counsel argued that the ban was clearly an attempt to silence the media industry, suppress creativity, and letting the dominant narrative of a certain segment of society prevail.
He asked the court to hold accountability of the provincial government for taking such arbitrary and illegal actions.
Justice Shabbir directed the information and culture secretary to pass a final order within 15 days after affording an opportunity of personal hearing to the petitioners and hear them on Dec 28 and pass a speaking order.
The judge expressed concern that an interim order that affected the fundamental rights of the citizens had been in force for the past month and there had been no efforts to decide properly upon the matter.
The petitions were filed by the Distribution Club (Pvt.) Limited, film’s co-producer Sana Zahra and others.
The film had initially been approved for screening throughout Pakistan by both the central and provincial film censor boards in August 2022. Later owing to pressure from some quarters, it was banned nationwide on Nov 11. A censor board review committee lifted the ban subsequently.
However, the Punjab government banned the release of the film in the province on grounds of ‘receiving complaints’.

Namdar Ali, a lawyer from Toba Tek Singh, filed the petition.
Justice Shahid Karim expressed his displeasure to the petitioner for wasting time of the court by filing an “unnecessary and baseless” petition.
The judge observed that the Constitution was very clear about the dissolution of an assembly.
“How can this court restrain anyone from exercising a constitutional right?” the judge asked the petitioner before dismissing his petition.
The petitioner submitted the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan announced dissolution of the provincial assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Dec 23. He said the dissolution of the assemblies would be against the mandate of the Constitution and the autonomy of the two provinces.
He contended that Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, in a TV interview, expressed his wish that the legislature fulfill its constitutional term, but at the same time claimed to have handed over a summary to Imran Khan for the dissolution of the Punjab Assembly.
The petitioner alleged that the PTI chairman wanted to dissolve the Punjab Assembly for his personal gains, but the act would be detrimental to the stability of the country.
He asked the court to restrain the chief minister from the dissolution of the Punjab Assembly in the larger public interest.

16,New varsities to be set up to teach skill-based technology: CM,LAHORE: Higher Education Commission (HEC) Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmad called on Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi ...,"LAHORE: Higher Education Commission (HEC) Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmad called on Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi to discuss measures for the promotion of higher education in the province.  
The meeting was held at the CM office where PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi and Higher Education Secretary Ahmad Raza Sarwar were also present.  
The CM was of the view that exposing the youth to skill-based technology was the need of the hour and new universities would be established for the purpose. The introduction of a uniform pay scale for university teachers was being reviewed and it would be linked with performance, he maintained. He further said free advanced courses were being conducted for the youth in collaboration with Microsoft to enable them to compete with the world by adopting new and modern trends in the field.  
CM Elahi further said technology was changing every moment and higher education would also have to be adapted to modern requirements. The Punjab government would extend full support to the HEC to improve governance in universities. He said it was necessary to end ad-hocism in universities to correct the academic and administrative affairs of the campuses, adding a lot of work needed to be done to promote research and the stipends for students to receive higher education should be increased.  
The CM said recruitments had been approved to meet the shortage of teachers in schools and colleges.  
Earlier, the HEC chairman, while talking to journalists, said there was no need to establish universities in remote areas and that higher education was facing a dearth of competent staff to be posted as vice chancellors. He said university teachers should change their focus from monetary benefits to teaching and promoting research.  
Mr Ahmad, while replying to a query about adopting a four-year bachelor programme in universities and colleges, said the decision had been taken in 2005, but was completely implemented in 2018. The two-year associate degree programmes started by different universities were not up to the mark and the varsities had not synchronised and updated the syllabus of the degree according to the four-year BS programme.  
The HEC chief said the commission was working to upgrade and update the syllabus so that student could enter the fifth semester of any BS programme. He further said there was a shortage of funds and the university administrations were directed not to start new projects.
