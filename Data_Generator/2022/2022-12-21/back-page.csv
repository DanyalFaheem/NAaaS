SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Dozens of armed militants stormed a police station in Wana in the early hours of Tuesday and escaped after looting arms and ammunition, police have confirmed.
Around 1am, militants armed with rocket launchers and heavy weapons forced their way into the police station, according to a cop, Rehman Wazir, who was inside at the time of the attack.
He told Dawn that around 50 militants entered the station after blowing up the front gate.
Heavily outnumbered in front of militants, around 20 policemen, including the station house officer, resisted for some time but were later taken hostage, another police official said.
Videos shared on social media showed a heavy bombardment of rockets and grenades at the station in the dark of night.

 





 
The attackers fled with weapons in a police van after the attack. Local police said the militants only took away eight AK-47 rifles from the station.

Around 50 assailants attacked the building with rocket launchers; two beheaded bodies found in Tank

One police constable was injured, while an alleged militant was killed in the attack, sources said.
The police constable, identified as Ilyas, was shifted to Wana hospital for treatment.
According to sources, the alleged militant was gunned down in an exchange of fire with Frontier Corps (FC) personnel. His body was later recovered from the Baghicha area.
The police station was briefly taken over by FC after the attack, but was later handed back to the cops by Tuesday afternoon.
Police said more force was deployed to Wana from nearby areas and currently there were 100 cops inside the station.
The attack created panic in the area and locals expressed their dismay over it. Shakir Khan, a local elder, said ‘good and bad Taliban’ were the government’s creation and locals want nothing to do with them. “The public neither wants neither good nor bad Taliban. It wants the rule of law in their area,” he said.
The police stations in North Waziristan and South Waziristan — two districts bordering Afghanistan — have been consistently targeted by militants over the past few months.
After a spate of attacks, police personnel vacated Raghzai and Khan Kot police stations close to the Pak-Afghan border. The withdrawal provided the militants with an open space to roam around the area and easily access areas such as Wana, according to sources.
Two beheaded bodies found
Two beheaded bodies were found in a watercourse in the Tank district on Tuesday, according to a police official.
The bodies were dumped in the Tangi Dabak village in the remit of Jandola police station, an official told Dawn.
According to officials from Jandola police station, the victims were identified as Shah Noor Bhettanni and his cousin Raheem Gul Bhettanni, residents of Kanazai village.
Police said a paper was also found by the bodies which read: “It is a message from Taliban to everyone that spying would result in such a death.” A case was registered and investigation started.
Along with the number of terrorist attacks, KP has also witnessed a surge in beheading incidents, allegedly by militants.
On December 6, a Frontier Constabulary soldier was beheaded by unknown attackers in Janikhel town of Bannu district. Later, the locals claimed that the head was hung from a tree in the Bachki market area. In the second incident, the body of a man, allegedly beheaded by militants, was found in Zindi Akbar Khan area of Bannu district. In both cases, the militants claimed the deceased were “spies”.

1,Special team questions Murad Saeed in Arshad Sharif murder case,"PTI leader called for statements, cross-questioning due to claims of having evidence related to Arshad Sharif's killing.","ISLAMABAD: An investigation team constituted to probe the murder of journalist Arshad Sharif quizzed PTI leader Murad Saeed and a lawyer related to the case on Tuesday.
Sources close to the special joint investigation team (SJIT) told Dawn that the PTI leader and the lawyer were called in for statements and cross-questioning.
Mr Saeed was called due to his claims of having evidence related to Mr Sharif’s murder.
In a press conference in November, Mr Saeed claimed that he had all evidence about what happened with Mr Sharif during the last seven months of his life, who threatened him, registered FIRs against him and forced him to move to Kenya.
He added if the chief justice formed a commission as requested by the late journalist’s mother, he will present the evidence before it.
The five-member SJIT was constituted by the federal government on the orders of the Supreme Court. The team, headed by Islamabad DIG Head­quarters Awais Ahmad, comprises officers from the Inter-Services Intelligence, Military Intelligence, FIA and IB.
Earlier, a fact-finding team — formed by the federal government, comprising FIA and IB officers — to probe the murder also called Mr Saeed for questioning. However, he refused to appear before it.
In a letter written to FIA Director Dr Muhammad Athar Wah­e­­ed and IB Deputy Director General Omer Shahid Hamid, who were part of the two-member team, Mr Saeed said they were answerable to Interior Mi­­nister Rana Sanaullah, and thus could not hold an independent and transparent inquiry.
In his letter, Mr Saeed said the government’s seriousness could be gauged from the fact that Mr Sharif’s mother had to invoke the jurisdiction of the Islamabad High Court to even get the post-mortem report of her son from the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad.

2,"Domicile be preferred to identity cards in recruitment, rules SC","“The domicile of a person is treated as a parent document for recruitment to ascertain the permanent abode,” observes SC judge.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has held that certificates of domicile should always be given preference in the recruitment process, as the entire concept of domicile will become redundant and meaningless if national identity cards are preferred to ascertain the permanent abode of a candidate.
“The domicile of a person is treated as a parent document for recruitment to ascertain the permanent abode,” Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar observed in a verdict he wrote as a member of a three-judge bench, headed by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood. 
The bench had taken up a set of appeals filed by the Charsadda district education officer (female), elementary and secondary secretary and the education director of Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa against various Peshawar High Court judgements issued between August 2018 and August 2019.
A number of female candidates had applied for the post of primary schoolteachers and their names were placed on a merit list, compiled for union councils. However, they were later refused appointment on the ground that as per their identity cards, they were not permanent residents of the area or there was a difference in their addresses.
The high court held that PST domiciles should be verified before considering the appointments. Since the education department after verification of the domiciles by a committee refused to appoint them, contempt of court petitions were moved before the PHC, which issued directions to appoint the candidates.
Taking up the matter, the apex court noted that candidates asserted unequivocally before it that they possessed the domiciles of the UC concerned and offered valid justifications for the intermittent change of address with further affirmation that the place of their permanent residence was as per their domiciles. 
It was clear from the provisions contained under the Pakistan Citizenship Act of 1951 that a person cannot obtain multiple domiciles, and if the jobs were given merely considering identity cards without considering the address on the domicile, then it would create complications and complexities, the SC held.
So for all intents and purposes, preference should be given firstly to the certificate of domicile, the apex court declared, adding that if CNIC was to be preferred over the domicile, then it would render the entire concept of a domicile redundant and meaningless in the recruitment process.
The court also regretted that all the candidates were allowed to compete in the aptitude tests for appointment on a contract or a permanent basis as per advertisement; they qualified the test; some of them secured top positions and collectively all of them were declared eligible yet they were dropped from the merit list.
The apex court regretted that nothing was said regarding any vetting of documents made before allowing the candidates to appear in the aptitude test and despite qualifying the test on the basis of documents submitted by them and securing marks on merit, they were denied the job opportunity at the eleventh hour, which was also against the doctrine of legitimate expectation. With these observations, the SC rejected the appeals and upheld the decisions of the high court.

3,Federal Shariat Court tells Balochistan govt to speed up action on bill against forced marriage,Directs officials to place draft of proposed law before provincial cabinet within 20 days.,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Shariat Court (FSC) directed officials of the Balochistan government on Tuesday to place the draft of a proposed law to discourage forced marriages before the provincial cabinet within 20 days.
The directive came after an FSC bench, comprising Chief Justice Dr Syed Mohammad Anwer and Justice Khadim Hussain M. Shaikh, started the hearing of a suo motu notice on the forced marriage of a five-years-old girl in Baluchistan.
The law officer representing Balochistan informed the court that the provincial government had drafted a bill, titled “The Balochistan Child Marriages Prohibition Act, 2021” and it would be presented to the cabinet as early as possible.
However, the court directed him to submit the draft to the cabinet within 20 days. The law officer representing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa sought time to submit a report to the court. The Shariat Court adjourned the hearing at the request of the law officers.
Mohammad, the father of a five-years-old girl, lodged an FIR at a police station in Khuzdar alleging that his daughter was married off to the son of a murder accused on the orders of a jirga to settle a case. Under the “reciprocal arrangement” worked out by the jirga, Mohammad’s son would marry the daughter of the accused.    
The father of the minor girl had also filed an application before the FSC in October.  
The Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 prescribes a punishment of up to six months for individuals who arrange the marriage of a child. 
“Cruel, un-Islamic and heartless ritual is found in many parts of Pakistan where girls are given in marriage or servitude to an aggrieved family as compensation to end disputes, often murder,” the bench said. 
“Under this custom the personal liberty of a woman is restricted for the rest of her life against all norms of justice. This contravenes Islamic injunctions and also Article 9 of the Constitution.”

4,Countries vow to support Iraq’s ‘stability’ at Mideast summit,Call for Baghdad to distance itself from foreign influence.,"SWEIMEH: Leaders from the Middle East and beyond pledged on Tuesday to support Iraq’s “stability” and called for Baghdad to distance itself from foreign influence, at a summit aimed at helping resolve regional crises. 
Iraq has been caught for years in a delicate balancing act between its two main allies, the United States and Iran, and Baghdad only recently arrived at a fragile compromise government after a year of political stalemate. 
The “Baghdad II” meeting in Jordan, which also included officials from France and the European Union, followed an August 2021 summit in Iraq’s capital organised at the initiative of French President Emmanuel Macron. 
Summit participants said they would continue to “cooperate with Iraq to support its stability, sovereignty and the democratic process in the country”, a final statement read. 
They also vowed to support “Iraq’s efforts to establish dialogue as a way of resolving regional crises”. 
The conference was a test for Iraq’s new Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, considered closer to Iran than his predecessor, and who was appointed in October after more than a year of political deadlock. 
Sudani committed to “balanced relations with all regional and international partners”. 
‘Pivotal role’ 
Iraq has endured nearly two decades of turmoil since the US-led invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003. The militant Islamic State group seized roughly one third of Iraq and declared a “caliphate” in 2014, before its defeat more than three years later. 
Pro-Iran parties now dominate Iraq’s parliament, and in October they named Sudani as prime minister following a year-long tussle with their Shiite rivals. 
“Iraq today is the scene of influences, incursions, destabilisations that are linked to the entire region,” Macron told the summit, in the Jordan’s Dead Sea resort of Sweimeh. “There is a way that is not... a form of hegemony, imperialism, a model that would be dictated from outside,” Macron added. 
Jordanian host King Abdullah II emphasised “Iraq’s pivotal role” in maintaining regional “stability”, while Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi emphasised his country’s “rejection of all foreign interventions in Iraq”. 
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan, whose country is Iran’s main regional rival, said Riyadh would stand “by Iraq’s side to preserve its stability and sovereignty”. 
‘No one expects miracles’ 
Several countries in the region are also mired in unrest. Syria remains a battleground for competing geopolitical interests, and Lebanon is stuck in an economic and political quagmire. 
Iran supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and Huthi rebels in Yemen, and holds sway in Lebanon through the powerful Shia group Hezbollah. 
Riad Kahwaji, director of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis, said the summit had “great ambitions” but that “no one expects miracles”. 
The meeting was also being attended by the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, who has been mediating talks aimed at reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. 
Borrell met Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, talks the EU diplomat said were “necessary... amidst deteriorating Iran-EU relations”. 
French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna said she also met Amir-Abdollahian, when she “mentioned the delivery of drones to Russia” for its war in Ukraine. 
For over three months, Iran has bloodily suppressed a wave of popular demonstrations sparked by the September 16 death in custody of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman of Kurdish origin. 
Borrell said he had stressed the “need to immediately stop military support to Russia and internal repression in Iran”, agreeing to “keep communication open”.
Tehran has accused Western countries and regional rival Saudi Arabia — with which it has had no diplomatic relations since 2016 — of fomenting unrest in Iran as protests rage on. 
Ahead of the summit, Iran’s Amir-Abdollahian said Tehran was “ready to return to normal relations” with Riyadh “whenever the Saudi side is ready”. On Tuesday, he “condemned the approach of Western countries consisting of supporting rioters and imposing illegal sanctions”.
