Conditions at Europe’s biggest nuclear power plant continue to cause global concern. Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of shelling around the Zaporizhzhia plant and thereby risking a catastrophic release of radiation.
Separate readouts from Russia’s Kremlin and the French leader’s Elysee Palace highlighted the difficulties in trying to find an accord to ensure safety at the site.
“The Russian side drew attention to regular Ukrainian attacks on the plant’s facilities, including radioactive waste storage, which is fraught with catastrophic consequences,” said a statement published on the Kremlin’s website.
It called for a  “non-politicised interaction” on the matter with the participation of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
In its statement, the French presidency said the occupation by Russian troops of the plant was what was putting it at risk.
“He (Macron) asked that Russian forces withdraw their heavy and light weapons from it (Zaporizhzhia) and that the IAEA’s recommendations be followed to ensure safety at the site,” the Elysee said. The IAEA has called for a security zone to be established around the site.
On Sunday, the agency said a backup power line to the plant had been restored, providing it with the external electricity it needs to cool its reactors and defend against the risk of a meltdown. State agency Energoatom had earlier said it halted operations at the plant as a safety step.

Residents in northern towns near the epicentre reported intense shaking mid-morning that cracked roads and rattled the cladding off buildings.
Local member of parliament Kessy Sawang said at least two people had died in remote mountain villages, with four others airlifted to hospital in critical condition.
“There has been widespread damage,” she said, adding that a landslide had buried homes and  “split” one village where people had  “lost their houses”. In nearby Wau, Koranga Alluvial Mining said three miners had been buried alive.
There are limited communications in the area, few government resources and very few paved roads, making assessment and rescue efforts difficult. Small aviation companies and missionary groups were involved in airlifting some of the injured across the rugged jungle landscape.
“It’s very difficult, the terrain, the weather. It’s challenging,” said Nellie Pumai of Manolos Aviation, which had transported one person out and was trying to return.
In the eastern highland town of Goroka, residents cap­tured images of window awnings falling off the cracked walls of a local university.
It was  “very strong”, said Hivi Apokore, a worker at the Jais Aben Resort near the coastal town of Madang.
“Everything was like sitting on a sea — just floating.” The quake was felt as far as the capital Port Moresby about 300 miles (480 kilometres) away.
The US Geological Survey initially issued a tsunami warning for nearby coastal areas, but subsequently said the threat had passed.
But fearful locals near the sea nevertheless fled for higher ground — reporting that the water level had suddenly dropped.

2,Queen’s coffin arrives in Edinburgh on solemn final journey,The queen’s coffin will rest in Holyroodhouse Palace for a day before being moved to St Giles’ cathedral.,"EDINBURGH: Thousands of mourners thronged the route for the final journey of Queen Elizabeth II on Sunday as her coffin arrived in Edinburgh from the Scottish retreat where she died.
Huge crowds packed the streets of Scotland’s capital as the hearse bearing Britain’s longest-serving monarch completed the first leg of a sombre odyssey that will culminate with her state funeral in London on Sept 19.
Soldiers in kilts stood to attention as the seven-car cortege arrived at Holyroodhouse palace after a six-hour drive from the queen’s Balmoral residence where she passed away on Thursday, aged 96.
Some of the well-wishers along the way had thrown flowers or applauded, while others were in tears as the convoy including the queen’s only daughter Princess Anne went by. “It is history, history in the making. We lived so long with the queen — 70 years,” said former soldier Stuart Mackay.
“It’s the only Monarch we’ve known and I think it’s my duty to be here to wave her goodbye.”
The queen’s coffin will rest in Holyroodhouse Palace, the monarch’s official residence in Scotland, for a day before being moved to St Giles’ cathedral for the public to pay their respects.
Her son Charles III — formally proclaimed monarch on Saturday — will travel to Edinburgh on Monday for a prayer service and to mount a vigil by her coffin along with other members of the royal family.
The body of the queen will be flown to London the day after to lie in state for four days, which is expected to draw at least a million people, ahead of a funeral set to be watched worldwide and attended by numerous heads of state. The symbolism of the queen’s last journey will be heavy for Scotland — a nation with deep royal links, but where there is also a strong independence movement intent on severing the centuries-old union with the United Kingdom.
Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wrote on Twitter that it was a  “sad and poignant moment” to see the queen leave her cherished Balmoral refuge for the final time.

“This is a matter that has to be taken to a referendum...within the next, probably, three years,” Prime Minister Gaston Browne told ITV News shortly after a local ceremony confirmed Charles III as the country’s King following Queen Elizabeth II’s death. The tiny Caribbean island nation, which became independent from Britain in 1981, is one of 14 Commonwealth members who share the UK monarch as their head of state.
Brown said becoming a republic was  “a final step to complete the circle of independence to ensure we are truly a sovereign nation,” but stressed a referendum was  “not an act of hostility”. The nation has a population of less than 100,000, according to official data.
Browne’s pledge comes amid a growing republican push across the Caribbean region, with Barbados voting to remove the UK monarchy last year, and the ruling party in Jamaica having signaled it may follow.

4,New wildfire spreading in California mountains,"The Mosquito Fire has now swept through an area of more than 41,000 acres.","LOS ANGELES: Califo­rnia’s latest wildfire has spread rapidly in the US state’s central mountains, just as firefighters were bringing a big blaze south of Los Angeles under control, authorities said on Sunday.
The Mosquito Fire has now swept through an area of more than 41,000 acres (16,600 hectares) in the Sierra Nevada range northeast of San Francisco in just four days, the official Cal Fire website reported.
Cal Fire said the blaze, covering parts of El Dorado and Placer counties, is just 10 percent contained.
It said while cooler temperatures — following more than a week of blistering heat — had somewhat slowed the fire’s progress, stronger winds were pushing it to the north and northeast, threatening hundreds of homes.
With the small town of Foresthill facing a growing threat,  “several more evacuation orders and warnings have been issued,” Cal Fire said. The towns of Geor­get­own, Volcanoville and Bottle Hill were ordered to evacuate earlier, the daily Sacramento Bee reported.

The decision to observe the day of mourning came after Prime  Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday accorded his approval to a Foreign  Ministry recommendation to this effect. The Cabinet Division was  directed to take further steps in this regard. 
Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in London tweeted: “To  express solidarity with the government and people of the United Kingdom  on the sad demise of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Pakistan will  observe a national day of mourning on [Sept 12]. During the day,  Pakistan’s flag will be lowered to half-mast throughout the country.” 
Soon after the queen’s demise, Pakistan’s top leadership, including President Dr Arif Alvi and Prime Minister Sharif, visited the  UK High Commission in Islamabad and offered their condolences.

6,Anti-immigration bloc gives tough time to ruling party in Sweden’s polls,STOCKHOLM: Swedes voted in a general election Sunday that will either pave the way for an unprecedented right-wing...,"STOCKHOLM: Swedes voted in a general election Sunday that will either pave the way for an unprecedented right-wing government supported by the far right or a third straight mandate for the ruling Social Democrats.
Opinion polls have predicted a close race with a razor-thin lead for Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson’s Social Democrats and the left bloc, following a campaign dominated by rising gang shootings and soaring electricity prices.
Polling stations were to close 1800 GMT, with final results due by midnight.
At a voting station in Stockholm’s Central Station, 34-year-old IT worker Erwin Marklund said he was concerned about the rise of the far right and had voted for the small Left Party.
“It’s important to not get the far right into the system,” he said.
The right-wing bloc has never before agreed to cooperate with the nationalist and anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, long treated as “pariahs” by other political parties.
The far right has leapt to second place in opinion polls behind the Social Democrats in the final weeks of the campaign, credited with around a fifth of intended votes.
Their surge — overtaking the traditional leaders of the right-wing bloc, the conservative Moderates — was attributed to an election race focused on issues including crime, segregation and the integration of immigrants.
Prime Minister Andersson, 55, hopes however to hang onto power with the support of the small Left, Centre and Green parties. “It’s going to be very, very close,” she told reporters as she cast her ballot in the Stockholm suburb of Nacka on Sunday.
Over 80pc of Sweden’s 7.8 million eligible voters were expected to cast ballots, and over 2.8m voted in advance, election officials said.
Tough days ahead 
Andersson, whose party has dominated Swedish politics since the 1930s, enjoys broad support among Swedes. She has consistently led her challenger, Moderates leader Ulf Kristersson, by a wide margin in opinion polls.
Yet pollsters put the two blocs in an almost dead heat, predicting 49.7pc to 51.6pc of voter support for the left and 47.6pc to 49.4pc for the right.
While online betting sites meanwhile gave Andersson as the favourite, Kristersson said Sunday he felt confident. “It feels like we have a lot of support and wind in our sails”, he said as he cast his ballot.
Kristersson is the architect behind a major U-turn for the right wing. He launched exploratory talks with the Sweden Democrats in 2019 and deepened their cooperation before the two other small right-wing parties, the Christian Democrats and to a lesser extent the Liberals, followed suit.
Sweden Democrats’ leader Jimmie Akesson told reporters as he queued in a long line to vote in Stockholm that “we hope to be in the government”, and his first priority would be to “push back crime”.
“As it stands, we have two fairly clear blocs,” political scientist Katarina Barrling said, noting it should be fairly easy to predict the next prime minister after election night. But both blocs are beset by internal divisions that could make for lengthy negotiations to build a coalition government.

7,Spielberg confronts his childhood as ‘Fabelmans’ premieres in Toronto,TORONTO: Steven Spielberg finally turned the camera on his own childhood — from his parents’ troubled marriage ...,"TORONTO: Steven Spielberg finally turned the camera on his own childhood — from his parents’ troubled marriage to anti-Semitic bullying — as his new movie  “The Fabelmans” received its world premiere on a star-studded at the Toronto film festival.
Considered one of Hollywood’s greatest living directors, with classics from  “Jaws” to  “E.T.”, Spielberg told a rapturous audience how he had long wanted to make such a deeply personal movie, but had eventually been motivated by the  “fear” of the pandemic.
“I don’t think anybody knew in March or April of 2020 what was going to be the state of the art, the state of life, even a year from then,” said Spielberg.
“I just felt that if I was going to leave anything behind, what was the thing that I really need to resolve and unpack about my mom and my dad and my sisters?” he said after the screening at North America’s biggest film festival. “It wasn’t now or never, but it almost felt that way,” said the 75-year-old. The movie — which will be released in November — is technically semi-autobiographical, following young Sammy Fabelman and his family, although the parallels to Spielberg’s own life could hardly be more clear.
Like the real Spielberg, the Fabelmans move from New Jersey to Arizona and eventually California, with Sammy falling in love with filmmaking and honing his craft as a young director with the help of willing friends and improvised camera tricks.
“It was really using glue and spit, trying to figure out how to put things together,” recalled Spielberg after the film, which recreates many of the amateur movies he made as a teenager. “I made all the behind-the-scenes stuff in this movie much better than the actual 8mm films I shot... it was a great do-over!”

Chicagoans shared photos and videos on social media of cars partially submerged beneath underpasses and plumes of water shooting up from sidewalks.
The Chicago Bears showed no signs of canceling a planned football game with the San Francisco 49ers at noon local time (1700 GMT), posting videos of the team warming up in pounding rain on a sodden field.
Even after the heaviest rain had ended by around 11am CT, the NWS warned that roads would remain flooded until the water had time to recede. The city on Twitter urged residents to avoid driving through standing water on streets, viaducts and low-lying areas.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or the IPCC, predicts more extreme flooding for the Midwest. Extreme rainfall events —  “very local, very intense, and hard to predict” — have increased in recent years, according to Chicago’s water management office.
Such rains can dump 2 inches (5 cm) per hour on a neighborhood, overwhelming local sewers, filling mains and pushing water into residents’ basements via private drains. 
As a result, the city has begun installing water blockers on catch basins that prevent sewers from flooding but can worsen street floods.

“Six fighters from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were killed” in an IS attack along the road linking Deir Ezzor province with Hasakeh, said Rami Abdel Rahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human rights.
A seventh was shot dead by IS-linked gunmen in the west of Deir Ezzor province, the Observatory said.
The attacks were carried out in areas under the control of the SDF, which is a key US partner in fighting IS and is the Syrian Kurds’ de facto army. IS seized swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, declaring a  “caliphate” to administer the millions-strong population.
A long and bloody fightback by Syrian and Iraqi forces with backing from the US and other powers led to its eventual defeat in March 2019, but sleeper cells of the extremist group still carry out attacks in both countries.
On Thursday, the SDF said two of their fighters were killed and six IS jihadists arrested following clashes in a volatile Syria camp where a security operation was underway.
Syria’s war began in 2011 and has killed nearly half a million people and forced around half of the country’s pre-war population from their homes.

10,Indian man chops off his tongue to appease goddess,"Man rushed to hospital, in critical condition.","NEW DELHI: An Indian farmer was in a critical condition on Sunday after slicing off his tongue as a sacrificial offering at a Hindu temple, police said.
The 40-year-old’s act of self-mutilation with a pocket knife triggered panic among crowds at the popular temple in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh on Saturday.
Investigating officer Abhilash Tiwari said the man and his wife performed rituals before he pulled out the knife, severed his tongue and placed it at the temple’s door.
“Our officers posted at the temple rushed him to the hospital with the help of other devotees,” Tiwari said.
The wife told police her husband  “sacrificed” his tongue to appease a goddess but could not further explain why, Tiwari added. Self-mutilation and even human sacrifice remain problems in India where a large segment of the population hold superstitious beliefs and sometimes perform bizarre acts to appease deities.
At least two similar incidents were reported in two Indian states last year when two men in their 20s chopped off their tongues and offered them to the gods.
In 2020, a Hindu priest decapitated a local farmer and offered the head as a sacrifice, claiming he had dreamt that a deity told him to do so.

11,Israeli PM in Germany to lobby against nuclear agreement with Iran,Israel has long opposed a revival of the 2015 accord.,"TEL AVIV: Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid arrived in Germany on Sunday in his latest diplomatic effort to persuade Western powers to ditch their tattered nuclear deal with the Jewish state’s arch nemesis Iran.
Israel has long opposed a revival of the 2015 accord, which has been moribund since then US president Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 and reimposed biting sanctions on Tehran.
Momentum that built towards a restored agreement last month appears to have slowed, after the three European nations that are party to the agreement — Germany, France and Britain — on Saturday raised  “serious doubts” about Iran’s sincerity in restoring the deal.
Meeting his cabinet before flying to Berlin, Lapid thanked these three powers for the  “strong position” they had voiced in a tripartite statement on Saturday.
The European parties charged that Tehran  “has chosen not to seize this critical diplomatic opportunity”, adding that  “instead, Iran continues to escalate its nuclear programme way beyond any plausible civilian justification”. 
Iran’s foreign ministry criticised those comments as  “unconstructive.” 
Lapid told his cabinet that  “Israel is conducting a successful diplomatic campaign to stop the nuclear agreement and prevent the lifting of sanctions on Iran.
“It is not over yet,” he added.  “There is still a long way to go, but there are encouraging signs.” An Israeli diplomatic official, who requested anonymity, said that Iran will be the focus of the talks when the delegation lands in Berlin.
“It’s important to continue to coordinate positions and to influence the European position. Germany has an important role in this,” the official said.
Lapid, who was travelling with senior security officials, is scheduled to meet Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before returning to Israel.
The 2015 agreement, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, gave Iran sanctions relief in return for restricting its nuclear programme.
Negotiations underway in Vienna since April 2021 have sought to restore the agreement, by lifting the sanctions on Tehran and pushing Iran to fully honour its prior nuclear commitments.
Israel insists Iran would use revenue from sanctions relief to bolster allied groups capable of attacking Israelis, notably Lebanese  group Hezbollah, and Hamas and Islamic Jihad, two key Palestinian militant organisations.
Last month, the European Union, which acts as the mediator of the nuclear talks, put forward a  “final” draft of the agreement.
Iran and the US then took turns to respond to the text, with Washington saying on Friday that Tehran’s reply was a step  “backwards”.
Lapid, whose late father survived the Holocaust, is also travelling with a delegation of survivors who will join him and Scholz on a visit to Wannsee, site of a 1942 conference where top Nazi officials finalised plans to send Jews to death camps.

The announcement was made amid a flurry of international diplomacy after fighting flared last month for the first time in months in northern Ethiopia, torpedoing a humanitarian truce.
“The government of Tigray is prepared to participate in a robust peace process under the auspices of the African Union,” said a statement by the authorities in the northernmost region of Tigray.
“Furthermore we are ready to abide by an immediate and mutually agreed cessation of hostilities in order to create a conducive atmosphere.” There was no immediate comment from the Ethiopian government, which has long insisted that any peace process must be brokered by the Addis Ababa-headquartered AU.
But the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) had until now vehemently opposed the role of the AU’s Horn of Africa envoy Olusegun Obasanjo, protesting at his  “proximity” to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
Sunday’s statement, which coincided with Ethiopia’s new year, made no mention of any preconditions for talks, although it said it expected a  “credible” peace process with  “mutually acceptable” mediators as well as international observers.
TPLF leader Debretsion Gebremichael had earlier this month proposed a truce with four conditions including  “unfettered humanitarian access” and the restoration of essential services in war-stricken Tigray.

NEW YORK: Americans on Sunday marked the 21st anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, with President Joe Biden visiting the Pentagon and New Yorkers honoring the nearly 3,000 people killed when hijacked planes destroyed the Twin Towers.
Relatives of victims, police officers, firefighters and city leaders gathered at the National September 11 Memorial in Lower Manhattan, where the names of those who died were read aloud — as they have been every year since the deadliest single attack on US soil.
They rang bells and held moments of silence at 8:46am and 9:03am, the precise times the passenger jets struck the World Trade Center’s North and South Towers.
Biden commemorated the anniversary at the Pentagon, where Al Qaeda hijackers crashed a plane into the massive building that serves as Defence Department headquarters.
In a steady rain, the president approached a wreath of flowers outside the building and placed his hand over his heart.
“Twenty-one years later, we keep alive the memory of all the precious lives stolen from us at Ground Zero, in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and at the Pentagon,” Biden said on Twitter ahead of delivering remarks.
“To the families and loved ones who still feel the ache, Jill and I hold you close in our hearts.”

 





 
Al Qaeda hijacked a total of four planes. The third hit the Pentagon and the fourth, Flight 93, crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers launched a revolt onboard.
Vice President Kamala Harris, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Mayor Eric Adams were among the dignitaries attending the New York ceremony, where relatives hugged one another, placed flowers at the memorial and held placards or wore shirts with images of their lost loved ones.
“While the grief recedes a bit with time, the permanent absence of my father is just as palpable as it ever was,” the son of Jon Leslie Albert said after reading several victims’ names, including his father’s.
Messages of sympathy and support came from outside the country, including from NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called September 11  “one of the most tragic days” for the US and the world.
“Facing missile attacks daily, Ukraine knows well what terrorism is and sincerely sympathizes with the American people,” Zelensky tweeted, referring to the Russian invasion of his country that has left thousands dead.
New York was illuminated late on Saturday by a  “Tribute in Light” that showed two blue beams projecting into the night sky symbolizing the Twin Towers.

14,"21 years after 9/11, Muslims still face Islamophobia",Statistics released by FBI indicate an upward trend in hate crimes against Muslims in US.,"WASHINGTON: “Here are the terrorists, catch them,” shouted a young man as he saw a couple walking on the corner of the 15th and H streets near the White House. “Tell her, she cannot wear a hijab in America.”
The woman was in shalwar-kameez, no hijab, and the man was in normal western attire, like most men around him. Both, however, had light-brown skin, which made them look different from others. 
While this was Sept 11, 2001, the day the terrorist attacks changed the world, for most Muslim Americans, the ramifications of the Islamophobia that those attacks had generated, continue.
Statistics released by FBI show that hate crimes against Muslims in the United States skyrocketed immediately after Sept 11, 2001 and are still on an upward trend.
As Americans, Muslims included, solemnly marked the 21st anniversary of the attacks, Khalid Tanvir, a shopkeeper in Springfield, Virginia, commented: “America has changed. The pre-9/11 America will never return, at least not for Muslims.”

Statistics released by FBI indicate an upward trend in hate crimes against Muslims in US

In a 2022 report, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned that “in recent years, anti-Muslim sentiment has spiked” and manifests itself in many ways, including “attacks on mosques” that “directly take aim at religious freedom”.
The ACLU, which looks after basic rights granted to American citizens by their constitution, noted that “existing and proposed mosque sites across the country have been targeted for vandalism and other criminal acts, and there have been efforts to block or deny necessary zoning permits for the construction and expansion of other facilities.”
A Gallup Survey report noted that in the first decade after 9/11 US authorities identified more than 160 Muslim-American terrorist suspects, “just a percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the United States each year”.
Yet, it created an impression that “Muslim-American terrorism is more prevalent than it really is,” the report added.
It noted that those who saw Muslims as suspects ignored the fact that since 9/11 “tips from the Muslim-American community are the largest single source of initial information to US authorities”.
After a six-year hiatus, US President Joe Biden resumed the 22-year-old tradition of hosting Eid celebrations at the White House in May this year. The practice was discontinued by the Trump administration, although President Donald Trump invited diplomats from Muslim-majority nations to the White House for iftar dinner in 2018 and 2019.
“Muslims make our nation stronger every single day, even as they still face real challenges and threats in our society, including targeted violence and Islamophobia that exists,” Mr Biden told those who attended the Eid dinner.
The semi-official Voice of America (VOA) broadcasting service noted that President Biden’s comments “marked a significant change of tone from his predecessor, Donald Trump, who said in 2016, “I think Islam hates us.”
Rising complaints
In 2022 Ramazan, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) reported a nine per cent increase in the number of civil rights complaints it received from Muslims in the United States since 2020. 
“CAIR received a total of 6,720 complaints nationwide involving a range of issues including immigration and travel, discrimination, law enforcement and government overreach, hate and bias incidents, prisoners’ rights, school incidents, and hate speeches,” it mentioned.
CAIR, which began documenting anti-Muslim incidents following the 1995 attack in Oklahoma City, claimed in a report earlier this year that Islamophobic groups collected nearly $106 million between 2017 and 2019.
Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the CAIR’s Los Angeles chapter, told reporters on Sunday, “Muslims continue to be the target of hate, bullying, and discrimination as a result of the stereotypes that were perpetuated by Islamophobes and the media in the years following the 9/11 attacks.”
