WASHINGTON: The floods in Pakistan are a forewarning to other nations that climate change can wreak unimaginable havoc if corrective steps are not taken immediately, Pakistan’s US Ambassador Masood Khan said in an interaction with the media at Washington’s National Press Club on Sunday.
“This phenomenon is going to grow whether it is Pakistan or any other country in South Asia or the world,” he said. “Today, it is Pakistan, tomorrow it will be another country.”
The New York Times reported on Sunday that the “scale of the devastation in Pakistan stands out even in a year punctuated by extreme weather”.
Editorial: It is naive to expect the world to support post-flood rehabilitation, reconstruction efforts in a big way 
Officials and relief workers in Pakistan “have warned that the damage and economic losses will be felt throughout the country for months and years to come”, the report added. 
“Even after the floods subside, rural communities face a possible second wave of deaths from food shortage and diseases transmitted by contaminated water and animals.”
Ambassador Masood Khan noted that reports in the international media were “showing heart-wrenching visuals” of affected areas, but “it’s only a fraction of the calamity that we are facing in Pakistan”.
Emphasising the need for a collective response to the devastations caused by climate change, the envoy said: “We should make a quick transition from mitigation and adaptation to preparedness and resilience.”
The ambassador warned against a post-flood food crisis because the floods had destroyed over 5.5 million acres of farmland.
“The World Food Programme and other international organisations must come forward and give necessary support to the people of Pakistan so that we can maintain our food security,” he said.
The Pakistani envoy proposed a robust climate financing mechanism to support those nations that have been adversely affected by climate change.
Experts blame climate change for this year’s unprecedented floods in Pakistan, which cover an area the size of the United Kingdom. Experts point out that Pakistan is responsible for only 0.4 percent of the world’s emissions blamed for climate change, but is among the worst affected by it.
Nuclear assets
Islamabad has assured the international community that floods have caused no damage to Pakistan’s nuclear assets as they are well-protected and secure.
During the briefing a journalist asked the ambassador “what impact have the floods in Pakistan had on the country’s nuclear sites and what specifically is the government doing to protect these sensitive areas from serious water damage”.
“According to the feedback that I have, our nuclear assets and our nuclear systems are secure and there’s no vulnerability whatsoever,” Ambassador Khan replied.

1,3 killed as dam bursts in South Africa,"""A mine dam collapsed and swept away houses and cars in the area,"" official says.","JOHANNESBURG: At least three people were killed and dozens injured after a mine dam burst and sparked flooding that swept away houses and cars in central South Africa, officials said on Sunday.
Television footage showed a river of mud and water flowing away from the mine and into a nearby residential area.
It covered roads and swept houses away in Jagers­font­ein, a town about 100 kilometres southwest of the Free State province capital, Bloemfontein.
“A mine dam collapsed and swept away houses and cars in the area,” Palesa Chubisi, a spokeswoman for Free State premier Sisi Ntom­bela, said in a statement.
“Three bodies have since been recovered.” 
Chubisi said 40 people, including a pregnant woman, were taken to hospitals, four suffering from fractured limbs and the rest with bruises and hypothermia.
National electricity utility Eskom said Jagersfontein was left without power after one of its substations was “engulfed by the mud”.
“Due to the current situation in the Jagersfontein area and inaccessibility of our substation, it is impossible to estimate when supply will be restored or to determine the extent of the damage,” Eskom said in a statement. 
Search and rescue efforts continued, while authorities were evacuating people in the affected areas to nearby farms, she added.
The flooding caused some houses to collapse “leading some members of the community to escape with only the clothes on their backs”, said the provincial department of social development.

2,All eyes on Xi-Putin meeting at SCO summit,"Organisation is due to admit Iran, one of Moscow’s key allies in the Middle East.","LONDON: In his first foreign trip in more than two years since the start of Covid-19, Chinese President Xi Jinping will reach Kazakhstan on Wednesday and meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s summit in the ancient Silk Road city of Samarkand in Uzbekistan, according to Kazakhstan and the Kremlin.
While Putin’s foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters last week that Putin was expected to meet Xi at the summit as Kremlin declined to give details on the substance of the talks, China has yet to confirm the president’s travel plans.
The meeting will give President Xi an opportunity to underscore his clout while Putin can demonstrate Russia’s tilt towards Asia amid worsening situation at Ukraine front.
The gathering of the SCO comprising China, Russia, Pakistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan is due to take place in Samarkand on Septe­mber 15 and 16. The organisation is due to admit Iran, one of Moscow’s key allies in the Middle East.

Organisation is due to admit Iran

The meeting is scheduled a month before Xi is poised to cement his place as the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. He is widely expected to break with precedent at a Communist Party congress that starts on Oct 16 and secure a third five-year leadership term.
Xi last met Putin in February just weeks before the Russian president ordered the invasion of Ukraine. 
At that meeting at the opening of the Winter Olympics, Xi and Putin declared a “no limits” partnership, backing each other over standoffs on Ukraine and Taiwan with a promise to collaborate more against the West. China has refrained from condemning Russia’s operation against Ukraine or calling it an “invasion” in line with the Kremlin which casts the war as “a special military operation”.
The deepening “no limits” partnership between the rising superpower of China and the natural resources titan of Russia is one of the most intriguing geopolitical developments of recent years — and one the West is watching with anxiety.
“The bigger message really isn’t that Xi is supporting Putin, because it’s been pretty clear that Xi supports Putin,” said Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London.
“The bigger signal is that he, Xi Jinping, is going out of China for the first time since the pandemic in the run-up to the party congress. If there were going to be plottings against him this is when the plottings would happen. And he’s clearly confident that the plottings are not going to take place because he is out of the country.” 
Putin aide Ushakov said the Xi-Putin meeting would be “very important”. He did not give further details. As Europe seeks to turn away from Russian energy imports, Putin will seek to boost energy exports to China and Asia. He will also hold three-way Russian-Chinese summit with Mongolia - a potentially much shorter route for Russian energy from Western Siberia to China.
He said last week that a major gas export route to China via Mongolia had been agreed. 
India on Sunday confirmed that Narendra Modi will take part in the SCO moot, but the government statement did not say whether he would hold bilateral talks with Putin, Xi or — for the first time since he became Pakistani prime minister in April — Shehbaz Sharif.
Sourcing most of its arms from Russia, India — which is part of an alliance with the US, Japan and Australia, has also refused to condemn Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine rather has ramped up purchases of Russian oil.

3,Russia pulls back troops from Kharkiv region as Kyiv forces advance further,"President Volodymyr Zelensky says Russia ""is doing everything to break the resistance of Ukraine"".","KHARKIV: Russia said it was pulling back troops from the eastern Kharkiv region of Ukraine as Kyiv announced massive territorial gains in its lightning counter-offensive.
A Moscow-backed separatist leader in the east meanwhile said Russian forces were fighting “difficult” battles against Kyiv’s troops in several parts of eastern Donetsk region.
A Ukrainian official also said Kyiv’s troops were closing in on the eastern city of Lysychansk, captured by Russian troops after fierce artillery battles in July.
Moscow’s announcement late on Saturday of the pullback alongside Kyiv’s claim to have entered the town of Kupiansk are the most significant shifts in battlefield dynamics after months of fighting in eastern Ukraine that has been dominated by Moscow.
“A decision was made to regroup Russian troops stationed in the Balakliya and Izyum regions to bolster efforts along the Donetsk front,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement.
News of the drawdown came just after Ukrainian special forces published images on social media showing camouflage-clad officers with automatic weapons “in Kupiansk”, a town of about 27,000 people.
Ukrainian troops had also liberated Vasylenkovo and Artemivka in Kharkiv region, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Saturday.
Separately speaking to the annual Yalta European Strategy forum, Zelensky said Russia “is doing everything to break the resistance of Ukraine, Europe and the world during the 90 days of this (coming) winter”, counting on an eventual weakening of Western support for Kyiv due to rising energy prices and heating problems.
“It’s their final argument,” he said.
There was no official confirmation that Kyiv’s troops had also routed Russian forces from Izyum -- an important staging ground for Moscow’s war effort with a population of around 45,000 people before the invasion.
But images flooding social media appeared to show Ukrainian forces within the city and Russian observers of the conflict said there were initial reports Moscow’s army had already withdrawn.
“Ukrainian troops are advancing in eastern Ukraine, liberating more cities and villages. Their courage coupled with Western military support brings astonishing results,” said foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko.
