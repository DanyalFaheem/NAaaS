0,Flood response goes digital to ensure transparency,"The dashboard will provide direct information to the public about the financial support, relief goods being received and distributed.","ISLAMABAD: In a bid to ensure transparency in the allocation of relief funds for the flood survivors, the federal government has decided to establish a ‘Digital Flood Dashboard’, which will keep the public abreast of relief measures taken by the authorities concerned.
The dashboard prepared with the help of latest technology will be launched by Planning Minister and National Flood Response and Coordination Centre chief Ahsan Iqbal on Monday (today) following the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
It will provide direct information to the general public about the financial support and the relief goods being received and distributed among the flood-affected people across the country.
The prime minister would personally supervise the digital dashboard.

PM Shehbaz expresses gratitude to Erdogan, UAE’s minister

The premier had earlier annou­nced that the audit of financial aid received for flood victims would be conducted by the auditor general of Pakistan and a reputed audit firm.
PM Sharif reviewed measures aim­ed at restoring life activities in the flood-affected areas and directed exp­editing the rehabilitation of roa­ds, bridges, power supply, and other relief measures. He also dir­ected that provision of basic necessities of life, including food items, should be ensured in the affected areas.
While stressing collective mechanisms and cooperation with provincial governments, he underlined the need for an early restoration of roads and the formulation of a comprehensive strategy to resolve other issues faced by the provinces.
PM talks to Erdogan
Prime Minister Sharif thanked United Arab Emirates Minister for Culture, Youth and Community Development Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan for his generous donation of $10 million to help the flood victims.
Similarly, he also expressed his gratitude to President Erdogan and the people of Turkiye for extending humanitarian relief assistance to Pakistan in the form of immediate dispatch of tents, emergency food items, and medicines via 12 Turkish military aircraft, four trains, and two Red Crescent trucks.
In a telephonic conversation with Turkish President Erdogan, Mr Sharif said “as per initial estimates, the floods are likely to reduce Pakistan’s GDP by over two per cent.
He said Pakistan was grappling with the immediate challenge of aver­ting imminent food insecurity in the country.

1,Rajapaksa leads Sri Lanka to Asia Cup glory,DUBAI: Sri Lanka were crowned Asia Cup champions for the sixth time on Sun­day after Bhanuka Rajapa­ksa’s ...,"DUBAI: Sri Lanka were crowned Asia Cup champions for the sixth time on Sun­day after Bhanuka Rajapa­ksa’s batting pyrotechnics and Wanindu Hasaranga’s all-round brilliance secured them a 23-run victory against Pakistan in the final at the Dubai International Stadium.
Rajapaksa smashed an unbeaten 71 to help Sri Lanka weather a top order collapse and reach 170-6 in their 20 overs.
When they returned, Hasaranga claimed three wickets in one over and Pramod Madushan claimed a career-best 4-34 to bowl out Pakistan for 147 in exactly 20 overs.
Pakistan won the toss and skipper Babar Azam had no hesitation in fielding first since the side batting second had won nine of the 12 matches in the tournament.
At one stage Sri Lanka were reeling at 58-5 in the ninth over after their top order wilted early.
Naseem Shah began with a wide, but redeemed himself on the third delivery by uprooting Kusal Mendis’s off-stump for a first-ball duck with a searing inswinger.
Haris Rauf removed Pat­hum Nissanka and Danu­shka Gunathilaka in successive overs while Iftikhar Ahmed took a sharp return catch to cut short Dhanan­jaya de Silva’s knock of 28.
Pathum Nissanka attempted to play his shots in the first six overs of power play, but miscued Rauf and was caught at mid-off.
Rauf sent the off stump cartwheeling in his second over to send Danushka Gunathilaka trudging back to the pavilion as Sri Lanka slipped to 36-3.
Wickets kept tumbling with De Silva’s innings cut short by Iftikhar Ahmed on 28 and skipper Dasun Shanaka bowled by leg-spinner Shadab Khan on two as a packed crowd, dominated by Pakistani, went delirious.
With Sri Lanka 67-5 at the halfway stage of their innings, Hasaranga (36) combined with Rajapaksa in their most productive partnership of 58 runs from 36 balls.
Rauf (3-29) removed Hasaranga, but Rajapaksa remained unbeaten after an incendiary knock that included three sixes and six fours.
Rajapaksa, who finished the innings with a four and six off Naseem in his 45-ball blitz, put on 54 runs with Chamika Karunaratne to further boost the total.
It was largely because of his scintillating knock that Sri Lanka plundered 103 runs from the last 10 overs.
Haris Rauf stood out with figures of 3-29 off his four overs of pace.
Early shocks
When Pakistan batted, Madushan claimed two wickets in two balls to rock the opposition.
Babar Azam was caught at short fine leg, while Fakhar Zaman dragged the next ball onto his stumps.
Madushan returned to dismiss Iftikhar (32) after the batsman had combined with Mohammad Rizwan (55) to revive their innings.
Hasaranga effectively derailed Pakistan’s chase when the spinner dismissed the dangerous Rizwan, Asif Ali and Khushdil Shah in the same over.
The victory would taste even better for Sri Lanka, who could not host the tournament at home because of a political and economic crisis in the island nation, though they retained the hosts’ honour.

2,"Yet to join contempt probe, Imran holds another telethon","Rs4.5bn pledged for flood relief; Fawad says PTI wants ""institutional balance"".","ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan on Sunday skipped another chance to join the investigation into the contempt charge he faces for his remarks targeting an Islamabad judge. 
Later on Sunday night, the PTI chief hosted a second fundraiser to collect donations from North America for flood survivors.
According to party leader Faisal Javed, Pakistani nationals including expatriates had committed to donating over Rs4.5 billion to the fund started by Mr Khan to help flood-hit people. 
During his previous telethon, the PTI chief had “collected Rs5 billion” in pledges, out of which the party claims Rs3bn have been received.
Earlier in the day, Mr Khan for a third time refused to appear before the joint investigation team probing a terrorism charge against him in connection with his controversial remarks about a judge, Zeba Chaudhry.

Rs4.5bn pledged for flood relief; Fawad says PTI wants ‘institutional balance’

The police had registered a terrorism case against the PTI chairman after he threatened the judge, alongside high-ups of the capital police, with consequences for sending his chief aide Shahbaz Gill on physical remand in spite of allegations of “custodial torture”.
Mr Khan has already skipped two hearings of the JIT and this was his third opportunity to join the investigation. 
The police had summoned Mr Khan on Sunday at 6pm in connection with the case registered against him at the Margalla police station on Aug 20, but he failed to show up.
Meanwhile, PTI leaders claimed he had already submitted a written response to the police wherein he refused to join the investigation or face the JIT. In his reply, Mr Khan’s lawyer claimed the “threats” against the judge could not be dealt with under terrorism law.
Telethon pledges
During the transmission on Sunday night, a US-based Pakistani citizen pledged $10 million to the ex-premier’s fund, while a Florida-based Pakistani pledged $50,000 to the fund.
One resident of Canada pledged to donate $25,000, while another pledged $100,000. An Attock-resident pledged Rs2.5m, while Muslim Care UK also pledged 30,000 pounds to the fund.
A former European Parliament lawmaker said 64,000 pounds would be donated to the funds, while anchorperson Imran Riaz Khan said he and his friends had decided to contribute Rs36 million to the fund.
During the telethon, the ex-PM said Pakistan was the most vulnerable country in the world to climate change for which joint efforts were needed to mitigate the impacts of global warming. About the donation pledged by Pakistanis at the last week telethon, Mr Khan said out of Rs5 billion, pledges of at least Rs3 billion have been materialised.
Sania Nishtar, who is in charge of the funds, said data from the Ehsaas programme would be used to distribute the amount among the survivors and assured that there would be no discrimination.
‘Institutional balance’
Meanwhile, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry at a presser in Islamabad urged ‘unelected institutions’ to respect the mandate of political leadership as he sought ‘institutional balance’ to address the prevailing challenges. “The ECP is also suffering from an administrative crisis and incompetence, be it constituencies or declaring four million voters dead, or now postponing the elections,” he said.
The PTI wanted to have “close ties with the institutions and want to be on the same page” but “unelected institutions” did not represent the people, he said, adding that the decisions should be taken by the people.
Mr Chaudhry also questioned delays in the cases against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

3,"‘AQIS, TTP men’ captured in Karachi",KARACHI: Law enforcement agencies arrested two suspected militants in different areas of Karachi on Sunday. One of...,"KARACHI: Law enforcement agencies arrested two suspected militants in different areas of Karachi on Sunday. One of them admitted that he had been working for the outlawed Al Qaeda in the Indian Sub-continent (AQIS) and had received ‘training’ in Afghanistan.    
The other was a member of the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s notorious Tariq Gedar group and was allegedly involved in attacks on security agencies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
Sohaib Tariq alias Usman, the first suspect, was taken into custody after law enfor­cement agencies raided a hideout in Liaquatabad’s Super Market, according to the police.  
He revealed during interrogation that an AQIS militant, Talha, had introduced him to the outfit’s chief in Afghanistan’s Bahram Chah region in 2019. Sohaib received training in militancy in Bahram Chah and met two Indian citizens, Abdul Rehman and Taha.  
He returned to Pakistan after a few months and started working for the banned group’s quarterly magazine, Nawai Ghazwa-i-Hind, which was shared with the outfit’s ‘sympathisers’ on the Telegram app. He was also tasked with putting online the audio and video recordings of speeches delivered by AQIS leaders, Maulana Asim Umer, Sheikh Osama Mehmood and others.  
Sohaib Tariq said he had gone underground after three of his accomplices were arrested. He identified them as Mohammed alias Arman, Abu Urwa and Abdul Manan.  
The police said they had recovered one pistol, one hand-grenade, three mobile phones and an unspecified amount in cash from Sohaib.  
The other suspect, Mohammad Shah alias Ding, was taken into custody by the Counter-Terrorism Department after a raid in Metroville, SITE. 
Mohammad Shah, who belonged to the outlawed TTP’s Tariq Gedar group, was “planning to activate the TTP’s network in Karachi,” according to a CTD spokesperson. Security agencies blame the Gedar group for a rocket attack on a checkpoint of the Frontier Corps in Azakhail.  
On July 17 this year, the spokesperson added, Mohammad Shah carried out an attack on police in Matna, leaving two cops — Jan Ali and Akber — martyred. 
“Shah was also involved in extorting money from several people in Darra Adam Khel.”

4,Advisers set conditions for LNG plants’ sale,The govt is trying to sell off two power plants to Qatar.,"ISLAMABAD: Financial advisers of the National Power Parks Management Company Limited (NPPMCL) — which owns and operates two LNG-fired plants with a combined capacity of around 2,500 megawatts — have asked the government to immediately finalise gas-sale and power-purchase agreements, debt recapitalisation and payment mechanism if it wanted an early sale of the two units to Qatar. 
The government is trying to sell off the two power plants — the 1,223MW plant in Kasur’s Balloki area and the 1,230MW Haveli Bahadur Shah plant in Jhang — to Qatar on a government-to-government basis as part of the International Monetary Fund’s conditions and has already held a series of meetings with authorities in Doha.
Read: Govt okays major changes to LNG policy
NPPMCL’s adviser Credit Suisse Singapore, which has been associated with the transaction since April 2019, has told Islamabad that finalising and executing the security package — involving gas-sale, power-purchase and implementation agreements (GSA, PPA and IA) — and resolving other central issues affecting privatisation, particularly payment of receivables, had been the “main reasons that have halted the NPPMCL transaction process”.
The two Punjab-based plants were taken up by the previous PML-N government under Nawaz Sharif in tandem with building the first LNG terminal and signing a long-term LNG supply agreement with Qatar on a war footing to overcome crippling power cuts.

Credit Suisse seeks immediate finalisation of gas, power purchase agreements for selling Balloki, Haveli Bahadur Shah plants to Qatar

Under that arrangement, the plants were to be operated on a must-run basis (meaning any power generated by them should always be accepted by the grid) with a guaranteed 66pc LNG supply by gas companies on a take-or-pay basis with the annual gas delivery plan.
However, the power sector, led by then-power secretary Ali Reza Bhutta, did not follow through with back-to-back power purchase agreements and payments against LNG supplies to reduce power companies’ financial exposure that remained parked with gas companies.
As a result, the PTI government, in April 2021, approved the waiver of a minimum 66pc take-or-pay commitment in the power purchase and gas supply agreements of three RLNG-based public sector power plants, including Quaid-i-Azam Thermal Power Plant, Balloki Power Plant and Haveli Bahadur Shah Power Plant.
The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) and the petroleum division had been opposing the move because it exposed petroleum sector companies — Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Pakistan LNG Limited and the SNGPL itself — to losses and “practically shifted circular debt from power companies to petroleum companies”.
The PTI’s decision entailed a major shift and envisaged submission of a monthly production plan binding on the power purchaser and the power seller (the National Transmission and Despatch Company and the power plants) under which the power purchaser is entitled to submit demand requirements as needed, at least 75 days before the start of each such month.
The concept of a monthly delivery plan for gas under the GSA had been paired with the monthly schedule as provided under the PPA as a “cost-effective solution, enabling the power and gas purchasers to make requisite purchases in line with actual requirements instead of following a fixed arrangement”.
Petroleum division’s disapproval 
The petroleum division, however, kept protesting that the entire LNG supply chain — including 800 million cubic feet per day (mmfcd) of imports from Qatar and the open market, regasification terminals, PSO and the gas network, had been put in place on the basic premise of LNG power plants and would become unsustainable in the long term just for short-term gains of privatisation proceeds.
In 2019, the cabinet decided that the 66pc obligation on power plants would remain intact until the first LNG price review in 2026.
As fate would have it, Mr Bhutta was transferred as petroleum secretary later and had to deal with the challenge of his own making. More interestingly, soon after the PML-N-led coalition came to power in April this year, Rashid Mahmood Langrial — a key force behind LNG plants — was appointed as the power secretary. Naturally, the LNG-based power plants are now paid against their power supplies on preference.
The revised PPAs, GSAs and IA could not be executed despite the approval of the coalition’s cabinet. While gas and power supplies remained generally uninterrupted despite grey areas because of public sector ownership of all entities and the build-up of circular debt in both power and gas sectors, such an arrangement is a major challenge for any outsider — whether a private company or a friendly government entity.
The government hired Credit Suisse as financial advisors for the NPPMCL on April 30, 2019 for a term that expired on Oct 30, 2020 but then extended for another 18 months until April 29 this year.
Credit Suisse has now linked the new 15-month agreement to complete the transaction with payment of all outstanding amounts, “including milestone-based fee and out-of-pocket expenses” for itself and financial close of the debt-recapitalisation process by the NPPMCL.
The Privatisation Commission expects inter-ministerial issues to be resolved soon to successfully close the transaction and a committee led by Power Minister Khurram Dastgir was “meticulously” working to remove the bottlenecks as the NPPMCL — a special purpose vehicle for LNG power plants — is a major and complex transaction.
The financial advisers’ assistance pertains to financial restructuring, divestment options, valuation, reference price, process, transaction documents, post-bid evaluation and closure of the transaction.
A top official said the government was committed to inviting the much-needed private sector investment and expertise in the power sector, and its efforts had already attracted international investors for investment opportunities in Pakistan — thanks to IMF programme compulsions.
Moving swiftly, the Privatisation Commission board on Sept 5 recommended reengaging Credit Suisse as the financial adviser and the cabinet’s privatisation committee, or CCoP, approved it three days later on Sept 8 to avoid further delay.
