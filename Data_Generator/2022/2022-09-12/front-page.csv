0,Flood response goes digital to ensure transparency,"The dashboard will provide direct information to the public about the financial support, relief goods being received and distributed.","ISLAMABAD: In a bid to ensure transparency in the allocation of relief funds for the flood survivors, the federal government has decided to establish a ‘Digital Flood Dashboard’, which will keep the public abreast of relief measures taken by the authorities concerned.
The dashboard prepared with the help of latest technology will be launched by Planning Minister and National Flood Response and Coordination Centre chief Ahsan Iqbal on Monday (today) following the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
It will provide direct information to the general public about the financial support and the relief goods being received and distributed among the flood-affected people across the country.
The prime minister would personally supervise the digital dashboard.

PM Shehbaz expresses gratitude to Erdogan, UAE’s minister

The premier had earlier annou­nced that the audit of financial aid received for flood victims would be conducted by the auditor general of Pakistan and a reputed audit firm.
PM Sharif reviewed measures aim­ed at restoring life activities in the flood-affected areas and directed exp­editing the rehabilitation of roa­ds, bridges, power supply, and other relief measures. He also dir­ected that provision of basic necessities of life, including food items, should be ensured in the affected areas.
While stressing collective mechanisms and cooperation with provincial governments, he underlined the need for an early restoration of roads and the formulation of a comprehensive strategy to resolve other issues faced by the provinces.
PM talks to Erdogan
Prime Minister Sharif thanked United Arab Emirates Minister for Culture, Youth and Community Development Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan for his generous donation of $10 million to help the flood victims.
Similarly, he also expressed his gratitude to President Erdogan and the people of Turkiye for extending humanitarian relief assistance to Pakistan in the form of immediate dispatch of tents, emergency food items, and medicines via 12 Turkish military aircraft, four trains, and two Red Crescent trucks.
In a telephonic conversation with Turkish President Erdogan, Mr Sharif said “as per initial estimates, the floods are likely to reduce Pakistan’s GDP by over two per cent.
He said Pakistan was grappling with the immediate challenge of aver­ting imminent food insecurity in the country.

1,Rajapaksa leads Sri Lanka to Asia Cup glory,DUBAI: Sri Lanka were crowned Asia Cup champions for the sixth time on Sun­day after Bhanuka Rajapa­ksa’s ...,"DUBAI: Sri Lanka were crowned Asia Cup champions for the sixth time on Sun­day after Bhanuka Rajapa­ksa’s batting pyrotechnics and Wanindu Hasaranga’s all-round brilliance secured them a 23-run victory against Pakistan in the final at the Dubai International Stadium.
Rajapaksa smashed an unbeaten 71 to help Sri Lanka weather a top order collapse and reach 170-6 in their 20 overs.
When they returned, Hasaranga claimed three wickets in one over and Pramod Madushan claimed a career-best 4-34 to bowl out Pakistan for 147 in exactly 20 overs.
Pakistan won the toss and skipper Babar Azam had no hesitation in fielding first since the side batting second had won nine of the 12 matches in the tournament.
At one stage Sri Lanka were reeling at 58-5 in the ninth over after their top order wilted early.
Naseem Shah began with a wide, but redeemed himself on the third delivery by uprooting Kusal Mendis’s off-stump for a first-ball duck with a searing inswinger.
Haris Rauf removed Pat­hum Nissanka and Danu­shka Gunathilaka in successive overs while Iftikhar Ahmed took a sharp return catch to cut short Dhanan­jaya de Silva’s knock of 28.
Pathum Nissanka attempted to play his shots in the first six overs of power play, but miscued Rauf and was caught at mid-off.
Rauf sent the off stump cartwheeling in his second over to send Danushka Gunathilaka trudging back to the pavilion as Sri Lanka slipped to 36-3.
Wickets kept tumbling with De Silva’s innings cut short by Iftikhar Ahmed on 28 and skipper Dasun Shanaka bowled by leg-spinner Shadab Khan on two as a packed crowd, dominated by Pakistani, went delirious.
With Sri Lanka 67-5 at the halfway stage of their innings, Hasaranga (36) combined with Rajapaksa in their most productive partnership of 58 runs from 36 balls.
Rauf (3-29) removed Hasaranga, but Rajapaksa remained unbeaten after an incendiary knock that included three sixes and six fours.
Rajapaksa, who finished the innings with a four and six off Naseem in his 45-ball blitz, put on 54 runs with Chamika Karunaratne to further boost the total.
It was largely because of his scintillating knock that Sri Lanka plundered 103 runs from the last 10 overs.
Haris Rauf stood out with figures of 3-29 off his four overs of pace.
Early shocks
When Pakistan batted, Madushan claimed two wickets in two balls to rock the opposition.
Babar Azam was caught at short fine leg, while Fakhar Zaman dragged the next ball onto his stumps.
Madushan returned to dismiss Iftikhar (32) after the batsman had combined with Mohammad Rizwan (55) to revive their innings.
Hasaranga effectively derailed Pakistan’s chase when the spinner dismissed the dangerous Rizwan, Asif Ali and Khushdil Shah in the same over.
The victory would taste even better for Sri Lanka, who could not host the tournament at home because of a political and economic crisis in the island nation, though they retained the hosts’ honour.

2,"Yet to join contempt probe, Imran holds another telethon","Rs4.5bn pledged for flood relief; Fawad says PTI wants ""institutional balance"".","ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan on Sunday skipped another chance to join the investigation into the contempt charge he faces for his remarks targeting an Islamabad judge. 
Later on Sunday night, the PTI chief hosted a second fundraiser to collect donations from North America for flood survivors.
According to party leader Faisal Javed, Pakistani nationals including expatriates had committed to donating over Rs4.5 billion to the fund started by Mr Khan to help flood-hit people. 
During his previous telethon, the PTI chief had “collected Rs5 billion” in pledges, out of which the party claims Rs3bn have been received.
Earlier in the day, Mr Khan for a third time refused to appear before the joint investigation team probing a terrorism charge against him in connection with his controversial remarks about a judge, Zeba Chaudhry.

Rs4.5bn pledged for flood relief; Fawad says PTI wants ‘institutional balance’

The police had registered a terrorism case against the PTI chairman after he threatened the judge, alongside high-ups of the capital police, with consequences for sending his chief aide Shahbaz Gill on physical remand in spite of allegations of “custodial torture”.
Mr Khan has already skipped two hearings of the JIT and this was his third opportunity to join the investigation. 
The police had summoned Mr Khan on Sunday at 6pm in connection with the case registered against him at the Margalla police station on Aug 20, but he failed to show up.
Meanwhile, PTI leaders claimed he had already submitted a written response to the police wherein he refused to join the investigation or face the JIT. In his reply, Mr Khan’s lawyer claimed the “threats” against the judge could not be dealt with under terrorism law.
Telethon pledges
During the transmission on Sunday night, a US-based Pakistani citizen pledged $10 million to the ex-premier’s fund, while a Florida-based Pakistani pledged $50,000 to the fund.
One resident of Canada pledged to donate $25,000, while another pledged $100,000. An Attock-resident pledged Rs2.5m, while Muslim Care UK also pledged 30,000 pounds to the fund.
A former European Parliament lawmaker said 64,000 pounds would be donated to the funds, while anchorperson Imran Riaz Khan said he and his friends had decided to contribute Rs36 million to the fund.
During the telethon, the ex-PM said Pakistan was the most vulnerable country in the world to climate change for which joint efforts were needed to mitigate the impacts of global warming. About the donation pledged by Pakistanis at the last week telethon, Mr Khan said out of Rs5 billion, pledges of at least Rs3 billion have been materialised.
Sania Nishtar, who is in charge of the funds, said data from the Ehsaas programme would be used to distribute the amount among the survivors and assured that there would be no discrimination.
‘Institutional balance’
Meanwhile, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry at a presser in Islamabad urged ‘unelected institutions’ to respect the mandate of political leadership as he sought ‘institutional balance’ to address the prevailing challenges. “The ECP is also suffering from an administrative crisis and incompetence, be it constituencies or declaring four million voters dead, or now postponing the elections,” he said.
The PTI wanted to have “close ties with the institutions and want to be on the same page” but “unelected institutions” did not represent the people, he said, adding that the decisions should be taken by the people.
Mr Chaudhry also questioned delays in the cases against Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

3,"‘AQIS, TTP men’ captured in Karachi",KARACHI: Law enforcement agencies arrested two suspected militants in different areas of Karachi on Sunday. One of...,"KARACHI: Law enforcement agencies arrested two suspected militants in different areas of Karachi on Sunday. One of them admitted that he had been working for the outlawed Al Qaeda in the Indian Sub-continent (AQIS) and had received ‘training’ in Afghanistan.    
The other was a member of the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s notorious Tariq Gedar group and was allegedly involved in attacks on security agencies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
Sohaib Tariq alias Usman, the first suspect, was taken into custody after law enfor­cement agencies raided a hideout in Liaquatabad’s Super Market, according to the police.  
He revealed during interrogation that an AQIS militant, Talha, had introduced him to the outfit’s chief in Afghanistan’s Bahram Chah region in 2019. Sohaib received training in militancy in Bahram Chah and met two Indian citizens, Abdul Rehman and Taha.  
He returned to Pakistan after a few months and started working for the banned group’s quarterly magazine, Nawai Ghazwa-i-Hind, which was shared with the outfit’s ‘sympathisers’ on the Telegram app. He was also tasked with putting online the audio and video recordings of speeches delivered by AQIS leaders, Maulana Asim Umer, Sheikh Osama Mehmood and others.  
Sohaib Tariq said he had gone underground after three of his accomplices were arrested. He identified them as Mohammed alias Arman, Abu Urwa and Abdul Manan.  
The police said they had recovered one pistol, one hand-grenade, three mobile phones and an unspecified amount in cash from Sohaib.  
The other suspect, Mohammad Shah alias Ding, was taken into custody by the Counter-Terrorism Department after a raid in Metroville, SITE. 
Mohammad Shah, who belonged to the outlawed TTP’s Tariq Gedar group, was “planning to activate the TTP’s network in Karachi,” according to a CTD spokesperson. Security agencies blame the Gedar group for a rocket attack on a checkpoint of the Frontier Corps in Azakhail.  
On July 17 this year, the spokesperson added, Mohammad Shah carried out an attack on police in Matna, leaving two cops — Jan Ali and Akber — martyred. 
“Shah was also involved in extorting money from several people in Darra Adam Khel.”

4,110 districts hit by floods as locals race to save Dadu,"45pc of country’s cropland washed away; nearly 1,200 killed since June 14; Johi, Mehar in Sindh cut off from other areas.","• 45pc of country’s cropland washed away, overall damages at $10bn
• Nearly 1,200 killed since June 14
• Johi, Mehar cut off from other areas
• Met Office predicts more rains, flash floods this month
DADU / ISLAMABAD: Sindh braced for yet more flooding on Thursday as a surge of water flowed down the Indus river, leaving parts of Dadu district inundated.
Meanwhile, Climate Cha­nge Minister Sherry Reh­man told a summit that “mon­ster” monsoon floods had washed away 45 per cent of country’s cropland, mai­nly in Sindh and caused around $10 billion in damages on the whole. In her estimation, around 70pc districts in the country are now under water. Overall, a third of Pakistan — or an area roughly the size of the UK — is inundated.
According to official data, the number of affected districts now stands at 110, including 34 in Balochistan, 33 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 16 in Sindh and the rest in Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir.
In Dadu, with Khairpur Nathan Shah city already sub­merged, residents of Johi and Mehar were racing aga­inst time to protect their cities.
The 50,000 citizens of Johi and 10,000 flood-affected people who have come here from various flood-hit villages are under threat as water level was rising along with the ring embankment in Johi city.

Tariq Rind, a resident of Johi, told Dawn that 600 villages of Dadu district had been submerged and many people were stranded amid a shortage of boats. They are also faced with food and water scarcity.
To reduce pressure on the embankments of Johi and Dadu cities, the irrigation department has made a 1,000-foot-wide cut at the MNV drain close to Manchhar lake.
Men, women and children have gathered to work shifts to form new dikes and reinforce existing ones using sandbags, stones and other materials. Apart from fellow residents, songs blaring from loudspeakers are a major morale booster for those working tirelessly to put anything in the way of water ready to swallow vast swathes of the landscape.
Death toll hits 1,191
The floods have killed at least 1,191 people, including 399 children, with 21 deaths reported in the last 24 hours.
The Met Office has predicted even more rains and flash floods this month. “Overall, a tendency for normal to above normal precipitation is likely over the country during September,” it said in a monthly outlook released on Thursday.
The military said on Thursday it had evacuated some 50,000 people, including 1,000 by air, since rescue efforts began.
“We’re on a high alert as water arriving downstream from northern flooding is expected to enter the province over the next few days,” Sindh provincial government spokesman Murtaza Wahab told Reuters news agency.
He said a flow of some 600,000 cubic feet per second was expected to swell the Indus, testing its flood defences.
Under 10 feet of water
In Khairpur Nathan Shah, the water level has risen to 10 feet, leaving thousands of families homeless. Residents were roaming from one place to another place in search of food, according to Hafiz Amin Jamali, the president of the local citizens’ action committee.
With the Indus Highway submerged, Mehar has also been cut off from other areas. Residents continued to raise the ring embankment level to protect the city.
“We have been working to make and reinforce this dike since early morning,” Damshad Ali, 20, told Reuters, vowing to stay in the flood-stricken area with his family.

Nearby, another man called for help. “I appeal to all young men to come join the dike strengthening, God willing we will save the city of Mehar from the floodwaters,” he said from a mound of sandbags as local residents joined the effort. Dadu city is also under threat from four sides.
45pc cropland washed away
The government on Thursday said “monster” monsoon floods had washed away 45pc of the country’s cropland, mainly in Sindh and caused $10bn in damages.
Federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman shared the figures at a summit jointly held by her ministry and Unicef in Islamabad to brief young leaders on the country’s vulnerability due to climate change.
She said Sindh was the food basket of the country and its 45pc area was washed away due to heavy flooding, which would bring economic shocks in the future.
“My generation had the carbon-intensive lifestyle and you will have to define at one level what we have to change in our life,” she told the young participants.
“No such environmental and humanitarian crisis has occurred before and we should consider this as the decade’s major climate event. As 70pc of Pakistan’s (districts) are underwater because of a climate catastrophe, make no mistake that it’s all man-made disaster and it will not go back automatically,” she said.
“Our folklore and songs had been on monsoon season, which used to be of two to three spells, but this is a monster flood. Our helicopters could not get off the ground due to persistent rainfall and inclement weather,” she said.
