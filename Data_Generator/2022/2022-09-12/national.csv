NO matter how strange it may sound, the fact is though Urdu was born in North India, its earliest written literary pieces, whether in prose or poetry, were created in South India.
The word ‘Deccan’ literally means ‘south’ and Deccan is recognised as the cradle of earliest literary pieces of Urdu. The first ever written literary work in Urdu — that is, discovered so far — is Masnavi Kadam Rao Padam Rao, research studies show. It was written between 1430 AD and 1435 AD by Fakhr Deen Nizami, in Deccan. Based on Hindu mythology, Kadam Rao Padam Rao discusses mystical issues figuratively.
But it took about 200 more years for Urdu prose to develop: Urdu’s first literary prose work is Sabras and it was penned in the year 1635 — in Deccan. In those days Abdullah Qutb Shah ruled Golconda, Deccan. On his order Mulla Asadullah Wajhi (1580-1640), a poet at his court, wrote Sabras, which is an allegorical tale that apparently describes the tussle between husn (beauty) and ishq (love). But it has some subtle ideas, too.
Since Sabras is an allegory its characters and even places are symbolic representation of a deeper meaning. Certain abstract qualities, such as love, wisdom, courage and honour, are personified to convey moral values and Sufi thoughts. Basic theme of Sabras is search for aab-i-hayaat, or elixir of life, which is ultimately found with much trouble and struggle, not to mention many twists and turns in plot. 
According to Wajhi, aab-i-hayaat is nothing, as is explained in the end, but utterance or discourse, say, a word spoken. But Wajhi has not been able to explain this as explicitly as Fattahi Nishapuri did in his Persian work, the original tale on which Sabras is based, says Moulvi Abdul Haq. He was the first scholar to have edited and published this centuries-old work, adding some 50 years to history of Urdu literature, which was further pushed back by Jameel Jalibi when he discovered and published Padam Rao Kadam Rao.
As discussed by Moulvi Abdul Haq in his intro to Sabras, published by Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu in 1932, Wajhi has borrowed the idea from Husn-o-Dil, or beauty and heart, a mystical and allegorical tale in prose written by a 15th-century Persian poet Muhammad Ibn-e-Yahya Sibak Fattahi Nishapuri. 
Fattahi had written this tale in versified form under the title Dastoor-i-Ushshaaq in 1436. As put by Jameel Jalibi, it became so popular that Fattahi re-wrote it in ornate prose and then again presented it in another of his work Shabistan-i-Khayal in 1439. It even inspired some Turkish poets to replicate it. Some 400 years later, Shabistan-i-Khayal was translated into English and German, too.
So, no wonder it inspired Wajhi and he wrote the story in Urdu prose, closely following the original tale. But nowhere has Wajhi mentioned Fattahi’s work and has claimed to be the originator of the story. But Wajhi must be credited for penning Urdu’s first literary prose work as before him all Urdu had in prose were religious works or treatises on Sufism and they lacked literary touch.
The language used in Sabras is now almost 400 years old. Its orthography is much different from what we are used to see today and one of the reasons is that in Deccan many Urdu words were pronounced slightly differently. Secondly, some words used in the tale are strange since they are originally from languages spoken in Deccan, especially Telugu, and are not part of Urdu’s standard vocabulary. Interestingly, words of Persian origin as well as local or Hindi words found their way into this vocabulary side by side, thereby giving significant cues to local culture and societal trends.
Sabras is in prose but reader often comes across sentences ending in rhyming words as was in vogue in those days. Despite a language that sounds a bit unfamiliar today, the tale is readable and an occasional aphoristic expression lights up the text with terse truth. Considering the era in which Sabras was written — some 400 years ago — Wajhi deserves all the kudos for writing a language that was not only considered to be standard Urdu in those days, but it was appreciated for its literary merits and is comprehensible even today, save for words from local Deccani dialects.
Jameel Jalibi has much praised Wajhi not only for the historical importance that Sabras has, but also for Wajhi’s ability for turning Deccani Urdu into a literary Urdu that served as a model for the generations of writers. Jalibi has rightly pointed out that writing of Sabras was a turning point in history of Urdu prose.

1,Canadian team due for flood damage assessment,Norwegian govt pledges $8m for flood survivors.,"ISLAMABAD: The Canadian government is sending a ministerial-level delegation to Pakistan in the next few days for a first-hand review of the impact of floods which caused colossal damage to livelihood of millions in Sindh and Balochistan and to scale up the emergency response.
The delegation will include Minister for International Development Harjit Singh Sajjan and several members of parliament, said Pakistan High Comm­i­ssioner to Canada Zaheer Jan­jua while speaking at a fund-raising dinner. The arrival of the delegation was delayed due to Queen Elizabeth’s death.
Mr Janjua said the delegation would assess the needs of flood-affected people and submit a report to the government, which will announce further assistance. 
The Canadian government has already announced $5 million for the relief work through the Canadian Red Cross (CRC).

Norwegian govt pledges $8m for flood survivors

The envoy said the CRC had raised $1.3m and was hoping to raise funds of up to $4m.
The high commissioner announced that PIA in Canada would accept relief items free of charge for onward transportation to Pakistan. PIA operates five flights a week to Toronto and arrangements have been made to transport one tonne of relief goods per flight to Pakistan.
The dinner was arranged in Montreal by Canada-Pakistan Affiliated Chamber of Trade, which announced that donations of $45,000 have so far been collected and more donations were forthcoming. 
WFP’s recovery plan
The World Food Programme has announced that once the initial relief response is concluded, the WFP will immediately implement recovery programmes to improve community infrastructure, create livelihood opportunities and boost resilience, combined with cash-based transfers, through early 2023.
Already, WFP has reached more than 400,000 people with food assistance in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh and continues to expand its operations in support of the government-led response across the country. 
Meanwhile, Unicef, the UN agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children, has said that education is in a state of emergency in flood-hit areas, as large-scale destruction of school facilities has interrupted the education of more than 3.5 million children.
Norway’s assistance
The Norwegian government has announced 80m Norwegian kroner ($8m) for victims of flood disaster.
According to a press release issued by the Norwegian embassy in Islamabad, the country announced that it would provide further support.
“The situation is desperate for many millions of people, and our partners are working tirelessly to reach those who have been hardest hit,” said Norwegian Minister for Foreign Affairs Anniken Huitfeldt. 
“The flooding highlights the urgent need to adapt to climate change and safeguard food security, particularly in the countries most vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters,” said Minister of International Develop­ment Anne Beathe Tvinnereim.

2,The rising ‘garbage mountain’ atop mighty K2,"Plastic waste left behind on world’s second-highest peak may contribute to accelerated glacial melting, expert warns...","ON July 22, Wajid Nagar and his team commenced the journey to scale the mighty K2. The climber was prepared for an array of challenges during the expedition, but what caught him by surprise were the mounds of trash piled up at the second-highest mountain in the world.
“As soon as we reached Camp 1, in front of us was pile upon pile of trash, including corpses, abandoned ropes, tin packs, tents, climbing gears, human waste, and plastic wrappers,” recalled Wajid. Most of the trash was found at camps 1, 2, and 3.
Wajid is not the only person who was concerned about the garbage. Sarah Strattan, a US-based climber who arrived in GB in June to summit K2, had similar concerns.
“Camps 1 and 2 were the worst,” she told Dawn.com. “And you camp right on top of it.”
Strattan said the trash also littered the climbing route. “We melt the snow for water at all camps, and if the snow is dirty, it can make us sick,” she added.

Plastic waste left behind on world’s second-highest peak may contribute to accelerated glacial melting, expert warns

One of the world’s most difficult peaks to summit, K2 hosted a record number of climbers this year. According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Tourism Department, 204 permits were issued for expeditions on the K2 this summer.
Nepal’s popular climber and athlete Nirmal Purja echoed Strattan’s thoughts. “The rubbish at Camp 2 was so bad this year that I almost threw up from the smell,” he recalled in a social media post.
Wajid said the trash, especially the ropes, was also fatal for climbers. “Because there are so many ropes, sometimes due to the weather you end up taking the wrong rope, which has been there for a while and weakened. Halfway through the climb, the rope gives up and you fall to your death,” he explained.
The mountaineer also said all the trash couldn’t be brought down in a day, or by a handful of people. “It would need another expedition.”
The GB government organised a campaign to clear the garbage earlier this year, after almost a decade.
Yasir Hussain, director of the Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP), told Dawn.com a team of eight climbers was sent to collect the trash from the K2 basecamp all the way up to Camp 4, at a height of 7,800m.
The clean-up mission lasted from July 19 to Aug 18. “The team ended up collecting 1,610kg of trash, including climbing gear, tents, ropes, cylinders, batteries, and shopping bags,” he said.
The garbage was then discarded at CKNP’s dumpsite. The official said separate camps had been set up for collecting waste every year and an incinerator was also fixed in the Askoli area to recycle and burn it. He admitted the waste this summer was the highest collected in years because of the number of expeditions on the mountain.
GB Tourism Deputy Director Sajid Hussain told Dawn.com every team that arrived to scale K2 was first briefed about avoiding restricted zones of the mountain and bringing back trash. The department also charges $200 from every mountaineer for garbage collection, which is later used for cleanup drives. But he regretted that climbers often ignored the guidelines.
Mountaineer Wajid, however, called the guidelines “rubbish”. He said that during his expedition, he had picked up and brought back nearly 22kg of trash. He also accused foreign climbers of littering the mountain, adding that the organisations that claimed to collect garbage in exchange for a fee were “more words than actions”.
With the number of people summiting K2 rising each year, the solution lies more in not littering than cleaning.
Haider Raza, the regional head of WWF-GB, said the impact of an individual on the mountain was way more than a group’s.
All the 8,000m peaks in Pakistan produce between 15 and 20 tonnes of solid waste per year, of which 86pc is generated from K2. The ecologist said this figure didn’t include all the garbage on the mountain that must be in tonnes. “All this trash, including bodies, can stay up in its original condition for more than 1,000 years because everything is preserved in snow.”
Raza explained the plastic, when exposed to the sun, produced carbon monoxide, accelerating the melting of glaciers. “All the waste then flows down into rivers and streams, creating problems not just for people but also the aquatic life.”
While the mess on K2 created a buzz, there is still hope for the future.
GB tourism department’s Sajid told Dawn.com that they were mulling refunding of the $200 fee charged from climbers who brought back their trash in a bid to encourage the practice. “We are also planning awareness campaigns to educate climbers more about collecting their own trash.”
Separately, the Nimsdai Foundation, run by mountaineer Purja, has announced a ‘Big Mountain Cleanup’ for K2 next year, it said in an Instagram post.
Sarah Strattan proposed climbing companies come together and be involved with the CKNP cleanup crew to alleviate the trash problem.
“The K2 is one of the most beautiful and amazing mountains on planet Earth and it needs to be respected as such,” she added.

FIF financing could help strengthen and sustain PPR capacity in areas such as zoonotic disease surveillance; laboratories; emergency communication, coordination and management; critical health workforce capacities; and community engagement, the statement added.
“FIF-financed projects can also help strengthen PPR at the regional and global levels, for example, by building capacity for medical countermeasures.”
The World Bank will serve as the FIF’s trustee with technical staff from the WHO. The fund’s governing board will appoint a technical advisory panel, chaired by the WHO, comprising leading experts to assess and make recommendations to the board on the merits of the proposals while ensuring adherence to health regulations.
World Bank Group President David Malpass. said that Covid-19 has highlighted the pressing need for action to build stronger health systems.
“Investing now will save lives and resources for the years to come,” said Mr Malpass adding that the fund will help low and middle-income countries and regions to be better prepared for global health crisis.

6,Concern voiced over spread of waterborne diseases in Balochistan,"Civil society, journalists, activists criticise govt for not releasing data on displaced women, destroyed schools, health centres.","QUETTA: Civil society representatives, journalists and human rights activists raised serious concerns over rapidly spreading waterborne diseases in flood-hit areas of Balochistan, lamenting that the government had not released any data on displaced pregnant women, destroyed girls’ schools, health centres and other facilities.
Speaking at a media awareness meeting jointly hosted by Women Lead Alliance and Balochistan Women Business Association (BWBA) on Sunday, the participants pointed out that many flood-affected women and children currently housed in tents were facing several health and malnutrition issues.
BWBA President Sana Durrani, child rights activist Behram Lehri, senior journalist Zafar Baloch, Nimra Malik, Ghalib Nahid, Behram Baloch, and others spoke on women, child marriage and other issues, particularly against the backdrop of devastating floods across the country that have affected millions.

Civil society, journalists, activists criticise govt for not releasing data on displaced women, destroyed schools, health centres

The speakers noted that floods caused by heavy monsoon rains had displaced hundreds and thousands of women and children across Balochistan and now they had to live in makeshift camps where they were facing health issues and malnutrition.
The government, they said, had yet to release data about the exact number of affected women and children, and lamented that the authorities concerned were not making a concerted effort to resolve their issues.
On child marriages, the participants said a bill was still pending in the Balochistan Assembly for several reasons, including opposition from religious parties and due to some so-called tribal customs.
It was suggested that organisations working on the child marriage bill should approach the political parties’ heads and get their support on the issue.
The speakers also observed that the authorities concerned were also not serious about addressing women’s issues, pointing out that a commission on the status of women was only represented by its chairperson while other members had not been appointed so far, allegedly due to some political reasons.
They observed that the commission couldn’t work without its members, adding that laws passed on women’s rights and child labourers were also not fully implemented.
The meeting also underlined the need for collecting data about women and their issues, primarily because of flooding.
