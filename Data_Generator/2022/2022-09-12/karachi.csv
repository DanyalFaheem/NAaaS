1,"Sindh cabinet fixes wheat support price at Rs4,000 per 40kg ‘to avert famine’",Cabinet meeting decides that the food dept will start releasing wheat stocks from October 1.,"KARACHI: In a bid to encourage flood-affected farmers to grow more wheat to avoid a famine-like situation in the province, the Sindh cabinet on Sunday fixed the support price of wheat at Rs4,000 per 40 kilograms.  
The cabinet meeting, chaired by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah here at CM House, was attended by provincial ministers, advisers, chief secretary and concerned secretaries. Various ministers, advisers and special assistants attended the meeting from flood affected areas through video links.  
The chief minister said that the provincial government purchased imported wheat at a cost of Rs9,000 per 40kg, which meant that the grower of other countries were given benefit. “Now, we have to think about our grower who still has to reclaim his land from the floodwater, prepare it for sowing and use costly inputs to grow the crop, therefore the benefit of better price must go to our local grower.”  
CM’s Agriculture Adviser Manzoor Wassan said that agricultural fields were submerged and there needed a lot of efforts to drain out water and prepare the fields for the next crops.  

New CEO of Sindh Bank, KWSB appointed

“If the wheat is not grown to a certain proportion, the province may face a famine-like situation,” he said and suggested offering high price to growers as an incentive.  
The cabinet members, after a thorough discussion, decided to offer Rs4,000 per 40kg support price for wheat crop 2022-23.  
The meeting participants decided that the food department would start releasing its wheat stocks from October 1, while the price would be suggested by a subcommittee comprising the agriculture adviser Wassan, ministers Mukesh Chawla and Ismail Rahu, special assistants Qasim Naveed and Haris Gazdar and Chief Secretary Sohail Rajput.  
The cabinet directed the subcommittee to file its recommendations within a week. 
On the recommendation of selection boards/committees, the cabinet  approved appointment of Imran Samad as president of Sindh Bank.    
It also appointed Salahuddin as the chief executive officer (CEO) of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) and Asadullah as the utility’s chief operating officer (COO).
The cabinet accorded  post-facto approval to 24 districts of calamity-hit areas, including two  union councils of Malir district of Karachi division.  
The provincial government had already notified 22 districts as calamity hit areas on August 21, and Tharparkar on August 29.
5,636 pregnant women living in camps: minister 
In a separate meeting, the chief minister decided to speed up relief efforts by providing ration bags, tents, and mosquito nets to the flood-hit people of the province.
Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho told the meeting that over 600,000 displaced people were living in camps, while 1,363,312 patients of different complications had been treated. 
She added that out of total patients 28 per cent had gastro, 27pc skin diseases, seven per cent dengue and malaria and 38pc had other health issues.
She disclosed that in camps 5,636 pregnant women were living, of whom 439 were near deliveries.
At this the chief minister directed the health department to register all the pregnant women and assign doctors to visit them regularly. “These women and children must be given health supplements,” he added.
The CM also directed the provincial disaster management authority to ensure proper distribution of mosquito nets to control malaria in the relief camps.
The PDMA officials told the meeting that a total of 183,424 tents had been distributed and 9,945 were in the pipeline. The district administrations had been provided with 145,090 tarpaulin and 60,000 were expected to be received within the next few days.

2,Alarm as poliovirus found in sewage sample in Karachi,Sample collected from a sewage line from Landhi’s Bakhtawar goth.,"KARACHI: The National Polio Laboratory at the National Institute of Health Islamabad has reported Sindh’s first case of environmental sample testing positive for the wild poliovirus Type-1.
The sample was collected from a sewage line from Landhi’s Bakhtawar goth in August this year.
The previous positive sample from Karachi was reported in May 2021 whereas the last wild poliovirus case from the district was reported in June 2020.
So far, this year 22 environmental samples collected from various parts of the country have been tested positive for the polio virus; 13 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, seven from Punjab and one each from Sindh and Islamabad.
In 2021, 65 positive environmental samples were detected in the country. Last month, the country reported its 15th wild poliovirus case after a 17-month-old child from North Waziristan contracted the disease.
According to officials, an immediate response round (sub-national) was implemented in August to mitigate the risks associated with poliovirus detection from the environment, besides extended outreach activities are also currently in progress in the districts with recent positive environmental samples.
Currently, wild poliovirus is endemic in two countries: Pakistan and Afghanistan.
According to the WHO, the detection of wild poliovirus Type-1 outside these two countries where the disease is endemic demonstrates the continuous risk of international spread of the disease until every corner of the world is free of the virus. There is no cure for polio; it can only be prevented by immunisation.
So far, this year, Pakistan has reported 17 cases of polio virus. Last year, nine cases were reported.
Meanwhile, provincial health minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho  has held a meeting where she was informed that the number of persistently missed children had reduced significantly in Sindh because of the special initiatives, supplementary immunization activities and health camps being conducted across the province, especially in super high-risk and high-risk union councils.

3,Doctors advised to avoid prescribing antibiotics to dengue patients,Pakistan Medical Association calls on govt to make anti-mosquito spray campaigns more effective.,"KARACHI: Expressing concern over the high number of dengue and malaria cases being reported in Karachi and rest of the province, the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) has called upon the government to make ongoing anti-mosquito spray campaigns more effective and drain out stagnant water/sewage from the flood-affected areas as well as Karachi.
The PMA issued guidelines for dengue prevention as well as management of the viral disease, which has already gripped the city as hundreds and thousands of patients are reporting daily at government and private hospitals as well to general practitioners.
“There is no vaccine or specific treatment available for dengue fever and the only prevention is to eliminate mosquitoes. This will also help prevent other mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, currently prevalent in the flood-affected areas, chikungunya infection and Zika fever,” the association stated.
According to PMA’s guidelines on dengue fever management, the disease symptoms begin three to four days after infection and might include high fever, headache, vomiting and pain in the muscles, joints, eyes and bones.
It can also be associated with skin rashes. In the worst condition, there could be bleeding from gums, nose, mouth, ears and other parts of the body.
“Take all preventive measures to avoid mosquito bite with the help of sprays, nets, mosquito mats, repellent solutions, etc. Cover water tanks and clean stagnant water found in or around the house. School management should allow the students to wear trousers and full shirts and get their school premises sprayed against mosquitoes,” the PMA stated.
It added: “In case of high-grade fever, do not take any antibiotic medicine, anti-malarial tablet or aspirin. Always take advice from qualified doctors. Drink plenty of water, eat home-made fresh food, have sound sleep, which will help improve body immunity.”
For doctors, the association advised that they should deal with patients carefully and avoid prescribing antibiotic or anti-malarial medicine in a case of dengue fever.
“We have seen cases in which there was a sudden drop in platelet counts. Hence, it would be better if the patient gets his CBC [complete blood count] test done within 24 hours of developing signs and symptoms. If this report shows low platelet count, then one should go for a dengue test,” said Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro of the PMA.
He urged doctors to focus on oral rehydration and offer symptomatic treatment to dengue patients.

5,Victims of Baldia factory fire remembered on 10th anniversary,"Govt, fashion brands asked to fully implement International Safety Accord on pattern of Bangladesh.","KARACHI: It was exactly 10 years on Sunday since the heart-wrenchingly painful incident of the Baldia factory inferno happened.
On the 10th anniversary of the “martyrdom” of over 260 innocent workers in the Ali Enterprises Garment Factory, labour and trade union leaders demanded implementation of the International Accord in Pakistan to improve the safety and health conditions in factories and workplaces.
A rally and sit-in was organised outside the site of the factory by the National Trade Union Federation (NTUF), Association of the Affectees of Baldia Factory Fire, and Home-based Women Workers Federation (HBWWF) that was attended by the heirs of the victims, labourers, political workers and representatives of human rights organisations. 
They displayed the pictures of the slain workers and lit clay lamps in their memory.

Govt, fashion brands asked to fully implement International Safety Accord on pattern of Bangladesh

‘Killing fields’
Speaking on the occasion, NTUF’s General Secretary Nasir Mansoor said that even after the passing of 10 years after the tragedy, factories and workplaces in Pakistan still lacked health and safety measures. 
He said that factories and workplaces in this country were still virtual killing fields for hapless workers. 
“Millions of workers belonging to the textiles and garments sector are deprived of their basic labour rights such as minimum wages, the right to form trade unions, social security, pension, etc,” he said, adding: “The local supplying factories of international brands are also involved in this crime and workers here have become salaried slaves.” 
He added that this situation in the backdrop of the issue of continuance of the GSP Plus status might bring negative consequences for the Pakistani economy.
He said that the GSP Plus is going to expire by the end of the new year and if the anti-worker attitude in Pakistan was not changed, the duty concession in the European markets would be withdrawn, jeopardising the livelihood of one million Pakistani workers.
Saeeda Khatoon, the chairperson of the Association of the Affectees of Baldia Factory Fire who lost her only son in the Baldia factory fire, said that it was due to the greed of capitalists that she along with other parents like her were mourning after their innocent children.
She said that there is greed in the blood of capitalists be they local or international. “The number of workers dying in workplace mishaps is rising. The heirs of the Baldia factory fire victims are yet to be doled out justice. The German brand Kik till today has not apologised to the heirs of the victims,” she said.
‘Women workers face sexual torture, harassment’
HBWWF’s General Secretary Zehra Khan said the Sindh labour department is doing nothing for the implementation of labour laws in the province. 
She said that to this day, the rules of health and safety law have to be framed. 
“Our women workers face sexual torture and harassment at workplaces and their voices are being gagged. The officials of police and security agencies provide security only to factory owners. The retired officers of security agencies are recruited by factory owners to harass their workers,” she said, adding that the contract labour system after coming to the private institutions is also being extended to governmental and workers’ welfare institutions.
Zehra Khan also reminded that due to the recent floods more than 50 per cent of cotton crop has been damaged and that this would soon result in creating a crisis in the textile industry rendering a large number of textile and garment workers jobless while also affecting the foreign exchange reserves of the country.
The moot demanded to fully implement the International Accord in Pakistan to ensure the health and safety of textile and garment industry workers. 
It was also said that all international fashion brands should ratify this Accord on the pattern of Bangladesh. 
They called upon authorities to fully implement health and safety law and asked them to decide the cases of the heirs of the Baldia factory fire victims. The stopped pension to the parents of the victims should also be released.
They asked to ensure a harassment-free environment for female workers and the setting up of anti-harassment committees comprising women workers. They said that all labour rights under the GSP Plus should be fully implemented.
Habibuddin Junaidi of Peoples Labour Bureau, Karamat Ali of the Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (Piler), Gul Rahman of Workers Rights Association, Saira Feroz of United HW Workers Union, Rafiq Baloch of NTUF also spoke on the occasion.

6,"This week 50 years ago: National unity, baby show and spirit of private enterprise","A LOT had happened in the 25 years since Pakistan gained independence, most of which was unpalatable — the...","


 
A LOT had happened in the 25 years since Pakistan gained independence, most of which was unpalatable — the separation of the eastern wing of the country from its western part was a major setback. It is in this context that the 24th death anniversary of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah held a special significance in the year 1972. 
On Sept 11, as reported on Sept 13 in this newspaper, speakers at a symposium held in the city by the Students Welfare Organisation and presided over by Mohtarma Shirin Bai stressed the need for strictly following the principles of unity, faith and discipline to rebuild the country. They were of the view that concerted efforts were essential to instil confidence in the minds of the people who had recently passed through the biggest crisis in their history. 
Paying rich tribute to the Father of the Nation, they said the country would not have lost the last war if the people had sincerely followed the teachings of the Quaid. Shirin Bai urged the younger generation to emulate the life of Mr Jinnah and to help maintain national unity in a time of crisis. Syed Hashim Raza, former governor of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) said the young should equip themselves with the knowledge needed to shoulder the future responsibilities in order to make Pakistan a welfare state. He added people must not allow doubts to enter their minds about the ideology of Pakistan. 
On Sept 12, another important personality, Abdul Wahid Adamjee, who had passed away a few months back, was fondly remembered at a citizens’ meeting. A big number of eminent personalities recounted the contributions made by the late Mr Adamjee to economic development, social welfare, education and rehabilitation in Pakistan. 
A resolution passed on the occasion read: “In him, Pakistan has lost a leading industrialist, a philanthropist of repute and a man with sterling qualities of head and heart who symbolised the spirit of private enterprise.” Those who spoke on the occasion included luminaries such as A K Brohi (who chaired the meeting), Dr Mahmud Husain, Rafiq Saigol, K Minwala, Amirali Fancy, G Allana, A K Sumar, M A Zuberi and Yusuf Shirazi. 
In those days, the future of Pakistan was not just thought about in terms of political and socioeconomic growth; even newborns and their health were examined publicly. 
On Sept 16, noisy and naughty babies became the object of adoration at the annual Baby Show in Karachi. Pint-sized babies (from six-month to two-year-olds) were brought by their proud but anxious mothers to compete for prizes in different categories. The function was arranged by the Social Welfare Services Coordinating Council to promote a healthy mother-child concept. Although the mothers had ‘dressed the infants in their very best’ the little ones hardly had the patience to wait for three hours or so for the judges to check their weight, hygiene, eating and sleeping habits. Many of them burst into tears under the gaze of the ‘somber looking’ judges — Dr Mrs Aftab Ahmed, Dr Shamim Syed and Dr Mrs Mehrunnisa Rahman. The children who fetched first prizes were: Asif Ali (six-month category), Chrys (one-year group) and Emran (one-and-a-half- year category).

A circular issued by Prof Salman Raza, the director general of the directorate of inspection & registration of private institutions, Sindh, informed all principals/administrators of privately managed schools that they cannot ask the parents to purchase printed cover copies, registers, journals etc from the school or any particular shop. Instead, the school might only supply the stickers showing name of the school to the parents to be pasted on the cover of school copies, registers, journals etc.
“Do not compel to the parents/students to purchase uniform, school bags, books, and other stationery items from the school or any particular shop. The lists of school books, copies/registers, practical journals and other stationery items be issued to the students at the time of announcement of results/time of admissions instead of asking them for money to purchase the said items from the school so that they may purchase the same from open market on usual rates,” the circular said, adding: “Do not ask the parents to pay money for dresses, foods items, Mother’s Day, Flower’s Day, Colour Day, Mango Day, Music day, etc.”
It also directed that the parents should be issued monthly fee vouchers/challan or month-wise fee be collected instead of quarterly/ bimonthly. However, two-month fee vouchers might be issued to the parents who intend to deposit the fee at their own discretion.

Private schools told to give fee concessions to 10pc deserving students

It directed the schools to collect only approved fee from the students and told them to display it on the school’s notice board and reception as well as provide the same to the parents on demand to let the parents and students be aware of the same.
Students’ uniform could not be changed before five years, and the permission of the directorate is mandatory to change it. 
Parent Teacher Associations
“As per Rule 12, it is imperative for the school to constitute Parents  Teachers Association (PTA) representing both the parents and teachers  which shall perform such functions as may be assigned it by the  Registering Authority. The school will manage / conduct the meetings of  the association on regular basis. This is issued in accordance with the  Clause 10(2), Rule 7(1)(3)(4), Rules 12 and 13 of “The Sindh Educational  Institutions (Regulation & Control) Ordinance-2001 Amendment  Act-2003 & Rule-2005.”  
As per Rule 13 of The Sindh Educational Institutions (Regulation & Control) Ordinance-2001 Amendment Act-2003 & Rule-2005, it directed the private schools to allow fee concession and award scholarship to at least 10 per cent deserving and meritorious students.
“No student shall be expelled or punished such as keeping them in isolation, standing on benches, scolding and rebuking, not allow to sit in examination/ test etc. on the basis of non-payment of the fee for the period of less than three months. Nonetheless, disciplinary action can be taken against the students for non-payment of the fee for more than three months,” it mentioned.
“No late fee shall be received from the students. Expulsion of any student from the school without necessary proceeding is prohibited. The parents shall be issued at least two warning letters and be given an opportunity to hear them in person before taking such action. In case of an unsatisfactory explanation of the parents, the names of their wards may, however, be struck off from the role of the school under the intimation to this Directorate,” the circular stated.

8,Haleem accuses Sindh govt of corruption in flood relief aid,KARACHI: Leader of Opposition in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh on Sunday raised questions over transparency and...,"KARACHI: Leader of Opposition in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh on Sunday raised questions over transparency and effectiveness of relief operation of the Pakistan Peoples’ Party government in flood-hit areas of the province and accused the ruling party of misappropriation of funds and relief aid being offered to victims of the natural calamity.  
Addressing a press conference in Sindh Assembly, he said he had heard very disturbing stories about plight of flood survivors in Sindh.  
“They are still in rescue phase and their rehabilitation is yet to start,” he said. “Despite funding of billions of rupees, Johi-Dadu Main Nara Valley drain embankment could not be strengthened. Rice Canal, Hamal Lake and Manchhar Lake suffered breaches. The natural waterways like Puran Dhoro are blocked due to illegal encroachments. If the excess water of Manchhar Lake had been discharged without considering the constituency of Sindh chief minister earlier, heavy losses could have been decreased,” he claimed.  
He said diseases, including dengue, were spreading fast in flood affected areas.  
He said snake bite patients were being rushed to government hospitals where no facilities were there for these patients.  
“Planeloads of relief goods are coming every day, but no one knows where they are going,” said the opposition leader. “Bilawal Zardari is said to have collected Rs130 billion in just one hour, but in whose pocket these funds have gone as flood victims have not received a rupee from this amount,” he alleged.  
He said that a number of relief organisations were working for the flood victims, but the Sindh government was seen nowhere.  
He accused Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon of misleading the people of Sindh through ‘fake news’. 
“Sharjeel Memon claims that 172,000 tents are provided to flood victims, but in which village? Where did the one Lakh tarpaulins go; and one million mosque nets, where are they? As an opposition leader it is my right to raise these questions,” he said.  
He said Sindh finance department released Rs7 billion for 23 districts of Sindh, but no one knew where they were spent.  
In Karachi, he said, 11 residents were murdered within a week, but the police were deployed to harass him. He said police had failed to give citizens protection. He said wheat flour was being sold at Rs105 per kilogramme and electricity was made costlier.  
He said in Lahore he had been arrested in a manner as if he was being kidnapped by more than 15 ‘private persons’.  
He said footage of this incident was present otherwise he might have been killed at some unknown place.

The graveyard is located about two kilometres from the Jamia Mosque of Khudabad along the main Indus Highway.
The tomb is located in the western half of the enclosed area.
Dadu Assistant Commissioner Shahnawaz Mirani, who is monitoring the situation, told Dawn said that floodwaters were directly moving towards Dadu city from Muradabad union council. He said that through a cut at Phaka Town road, efforts were made to weaken the deluge.

Despite hectic efforts to ease pressure on the lake over the last week, the lake’s gauge showed the level rising above the danger level of 123.3RL.
Three cuts had already been given and a fourth one was now likely, he said, observing that floodwater that had spread earlier was finding its way into the lake, which is a bowl shaped structure. He explained that the water level in the Main Nara Valley Drain (MNVD) or Right Bank Outfall Drain-I at RD-60 had recorded a fall of around 1ft to 1.5ft which showed water flows upstream Manchhar were recording a fall.
“A positive sign is that Indus river has continuously shown reduction downstream Sukkur Barrage so far,” he said while alluding to recording of two gauges at 6pm. He referred to Dadu-Moro gauge of 128ft and Amri bridge gauge of 110.2ft. Dadu-Moro gauge at 6am was 128.5ft. “Amri bridge is located downstream Manchhar lake and upstream Kotri Barrage”, he said.
According to irrigation figures, in previous weeks Manchhar level had finally risen to an alarming level of 123.3RL after deluges from Flood Protective (FP) bund and MNVD kept entering it after rains. It had dropped to 122.2RL.
After rising water level in the lake had rung alarm bells last week, irrigation authorities gave cuts to Manchhar’s embankment on Sept 4 and 5 at RD-52 and RD-14. Then came breach at RD-10 of MNVD, leading to displacement of people from five UCs in Sehwan taluka — Jaffarabad, Bubak, Wahur, Channa and Arazi. But later, remaining five UCs of the taluka were also inundated. The lake’s Aral tail, Aral head and Danister Wah regulators are currently releasing water into Indus River.
Wapda chief engineer (water) Sukkur Naeem Qadir Mangi also confirmed a two- to three-inch reduction in the MNVD at RD-20, Indus Link and Kari Mori locations during Sunday’s measurement. 
CM briefed on flood situation
The irrigation department on Sunday informed Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah during a meeting that Kotri was still in high flood with 620,095 cusecs upstream and 593,597 downstream while Guddu and Sukkur were in normal position.
The CM was told that Manchhar Lake level was at 122.8RL today (Sept 11).
The chief minister said that it was 122.5RL a day earlier and it meant that the water level was still on the rise despite discharging its water into the River Indus.
Irrigation Secretary Sohail Qureshi informed the chief minister that 97,017 cusecs of Manchhar Lake water were discharged into the river and hopefully its water level would come down within the next 48 hours.

The Pakistan Peoples Party’s MPA told media persons on Sunday that chief engineer had suspended supply of water to their area, which would inflict huge losses on growers. 
He said that at a time when most of the province was under water and Kotri barrage downstream was flowing with had 600,000 cusecs the growers of his constituency were thirsting for water. 
“I, as an elected representative of the areas, have approached the authorities several times for release of water into the canals of low-lying areas of my constituency but they turned a deaf ear to my requests,” he said.
He alleged the negligent officers wanted to suppress his people economically and spoil reputation of the ruling party. 
He warned that he and growers of his area would stage a massive protest against the irrigation department for its negligence and irresponsibility that could lead to economic crisis in the two talukas of Sujawal district. 
About the MPA claims, veteran agronomist Obhayo Khan Khushik said that despite sufficient water in Old Phuleli canal, such complaints could only be attributed to negligence of the irrigation department. 
He said that water was essential for paddy fields during ongoing season. Water supply to the tail-end areas for even one week would be sufficient to cater to the area’s needs, he said. 
Social activist Zahid Ishaque said that scarcity of water amid widespread flooding had exposed ugly face of the irrigation department. The chief minister should take the issue seriously, he said.
