Bangladesh this week appointed Nurul captain for a three-match series against Zimbabwe, resting regular captain Mahmudullah Riyad, whom local media have tipped for imminent retirement.
“We are lagging behind in Tests and T20s compared to one-day internationals. It is important for us we improve,” Nurul said in his first press conference as captain in Dhaka.
“For me fearless cricket is important. We will see if we can do this,” he added.
“If we remain fearless, chances for things turning positive will be high. When you have fear of failure it will affect you negatively.” Mahmud­ullah’s absence means Bangladesh will play a series for the first time in many years without a single member of the team’s “Fabulous Four”.
Senior cricketer Mushfiqur Rahim has also been rested for the Zimbabwe series, while star all-rounder Shakib Al-Hasan took personal leave and batter Tamim Iqbal this week announced his T20I retirement.
Nurul has been tasked to lead the team into a new era, with the ICC T20 World Cup just a few months away.
He inherited a team that won just one of their last 13 matches and is currently ranked ninth in the world.
Bangladesh will play three T20Is against Zimbabwe at Harare Sports Club ground starting July 30.
They will also play a tri-nation tournament in New Zealand alongside Pak­istan in October before the T20 World Cup in Australia.

1,"Omar, Yashal to participate at US Junior Amateurs",They earned exemptions to play in the prestigious championship to be held from July 25 to 30.,"KARACHI: Omar Khalid and Yashal Shah, Pakistan’s top and third-ranked amateurs, will feature in the 74th US Junior Amateur Championship, one of the biggest junior competitions in international golf, at the world famous Bandon Dunes Golf Resort in Oregon, USA.
It is a rare occasion for Pakistan golf as Omar and Yashal earned exemptions to play in the prestigious championship to be held from July 25 to 30. A total of 264 players from all over the world will take part in the championship. Only 47 of them have earned an exemption on the basis of their positions in the World Amateur Golf Rankings (WAGR) while the rest won tickets to Bandon Dunes via qualifying rounds which took place in various parts of the US earlier this summer.
While Omar, who holds the record of being the youngest ever National Amateur champion of Pakistan, has risen to a career-high No.294 in the WAGR and also took part in the British Amateurs last month, the talented Yashal has won several tournaments domestically and is ranked 503rd.
The legendary Tiger Woods as well as Jordan Spieth are past winners of the US Junior Amateurs.
A field of 264 golfers will compete in stroke-play competition on Monday and Tuesday. The top 64 will advance to the match-play competition which will begin on Wednesday and conclude on Saturday with a 36-hole match between the finalists.
The winner of the championship will earn an exemption into the 2023 US Open to be played at the Los Angeles Country Club. He will also earn an exemption into the next two US Amateurs.

2,Scotland’s cricket board resigns over racism report,"Says it is “truly sorry” and apologises to “everyone who has experienced racism, or any other form of discrimination”.","LONDON: The board of the Scottish cricket federation resigned en masse on Sunday following accusations of institutional racism in a damning independent review which is due to be published on Monday. 
“The Board of Cricket Scotland has resigned. We will work in partnership with @sportscotland with immediate effect to ensure appropriate governance, leadership & support is in place for sport in the days ahead,” Cricket Scotland tweeted on Sunday.

 





 
The review was commissioned by Sport Scotland, the national funding body, after Scotland’s all-time leading wicket-taker Majid Haq told Sky Sports News that Cricket Scotland was “institutionally racist”.
Haq’s former team-mate Qasim Sheikh said he had also suffered racist abuse.
In its resignation letter to the interim chief executive, the Cricket Scotland board said it was “truly sorry” and apologised to “everyone who has experienced racism, or any other form of discrimination” while playing the game in Scotland. 
“The review has achieved an unparallelled level of engagement and we believe it will be truly transformative, not just for Cricket Scotland and the sport of cricket, but it will provide a watershed moment for Scottish sport and society in general.” 
The statement added the current board had not seen the contents of the report.
However, it added the board had been made aware of “proposed timescales and certain mandated actions” recommended by the review.
In the view of the outgoing board, plans to both resolve the racism issues quickly and modernise the running of Cricket Scotland were “unachievable within the timetable proposed and the current governance framework”. 
“Consequently, we believe we must now step aside to enable the required progress to be made in the coming months,” the statement added.

The two parties are committed to a full transfer and not a loan with an option to buy, as was initially indicated.
It now remains for the 24-year-old to undergo a medical examination before signing his contract with PSG.
The arrival at PSG of Mukiele, who joined Leipzig from Montpellier in 2018, will provide an alternative to Achraf Hakimi on the right side of defence.
Mukiele — who can also play in a three-man defence, a system favoured by new coach Christophe Galtier — will be the French champions’ third summer recruit after Portuguese midfielder Vitinha and young French striker Hugo Ekitike.
Mukiele won his only France cap as a substitute in a World Cup qualifier against Finland in September 2021.

6,"After missing out on worlds podium, Arshad eyes medal at CWG",He is the only athlete from Pakistan to have qualified for a final in the history of the championships.,"EUGENE: With his third throw in the javelin final at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday, Arshad Nadeem made sure his challenge would stay alive till the very end.
The only athlete from Pakistan to have qualified for a final in the history of the championships, Arshad had made the final eight halfway through the event at Hayward Field but his effort of 82.05m meant he was last among them.
By then the 25-year-old knew he had to improve on his personal best if he was to create more history for Pakistan by winning the country’s maiden medal at track and field’s biennial extravaganza.
At that point, the bar had been set by 24-years-old defending champion Anderson Peters of Granada (90.46m). Peters, who would go on to retain his title, was followed by Czech Jakub Vadlejch (88.09m) and Germany’s Julian Weber (86.86m). Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra of India (86.37m) was fourth.
The target set, Arshad took aim. He conjured up a season-best 86.16m — 22 centimetres less than his all-time best — with his fourth throw. It moved him fifth and that’s where he finished in the end, after failing to improve further with his last two throws.
“It’s a performance that makes me hopeful for the future,” Arshad, who made history by becoming the first athlete from Pakistan to qualify for a track and field final at the Olympics in Tokyo last year, told reporters.
Arshad has been nursing an elbow injury since the Olympics, where he also finished fifth, and he competed on Saturday with his throwing arm taped.
“This was my first event since the Olympics so naturally I was a bit worried,” he informed. “The officials of the Athletics Federation of Pakistan, the doctors worked a lot to ensure I could compete here against the best in the world.”
With the Commonwealth Games set to begin later this month, Arshad was hopeful of a podium finish in Birmingham.
“I’m satisfied with my performance and will try my best to win a medal at the Commonwealths,” Arshad, who won bronze at the last Asian Games, added.
Arshad also received a word of praise for his performance from Chopra, who eventually took silver behind Peters.
Chopra and Arshad have competed against each other several times, including at the Asian Games in 2018 where the former took gold and his rival from Pakistan finished third.
“I spoke to Arshad after the competition ended,” Chopra told a virtual news conference. “I told him that he did very well. He informed me he had issues with his elbow.
“I further congratulated him for a great throw and it was a great comeback from injury. It was commendable that he threw the javelin over 86 metres.”
Chopra threw a best of 88.13m with his fourth throw to finish ahead of bronze medallist Vadlejch, who won silver in Tokyo, and fourth-placed Weber. His effort was beyond the 87.58m he produced in Tokyo, where he became the first Indian to win an individual athletics gold.
His silver medal in Eugene was India’s first at a World Championships and just the country’s second overall after Anju Bobby George took bronze in the women’s long jump in Paris in 2003.
But there was no catching Peters, who led the competition throughout and saved his best for last with a throw of 90.54m.
Peters was the only athlete to breach the 90m-mark, doing so three times in windy conditions at Hayward Field.
“Most of the throwers prefer the wind from behind but today we had a head wind,” Peters said. “So it was a bit challenging today but I pulled it off. To defend the title is not an easy task. I had to push myself.
“The last attempt, I already knew I was a champion but I was working on my technique in every throw and I finally got it through.”
Finland’s Lassi Etelatalo was sixth (82.70m). Moldova’s Andrian Mardare and Finland’s Oliver Helander also threw beyond 82 metres in seventh and eighth respectively.

7,Rain trumps De Kock’s unbeaten 92 as England draw series with SA,LEEDS: South Africa opener Quinton de Kock’s unbeaten 92 turned out to be in vain as rain scuppered hopes of a...,"LEEDS: South Africa opener Quinton de Kock’s unbeaten 92 turned out to be in vain as rain scuppered hopes of a result in Sunday’s third and final one-day international against England, with the series ending all square at 1-1.
The Proteas were 159-2 in the 28th over, with De Kock having struck 92 off just 76 balls, including 13 fours, when rain stopped play for the second time at Headingley.
Both sides needed to bat for a minimum of 20 overs for a result to be declared under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method for rain-affected white-ball games.
But the umpires deemed that would not be possible when they called the game off shortly after 4:00 pm local time (1500 GMT) as a series that had started during a nationwide heatwave ended in more familiarly English conditions.
The abandonment meant left-hander De Kock was just eight runs shy of what would have been his 18th ODI century.
“He looked in really good touch, it’s a pity he couldn’t get the magical mark,” said South Africa captain Keshav Maharaj of De Kock’s innings.
“But there is a lot of cricket left, and hopefully he can replicate much of this performance going forward.” England captain Jos Buttler said:  “It was a good wicket and this can be a tough ground to defend at times.
“The game was quite evenly poised. It would have been great to have a full game.” England had gone into this match looking to avoid a third consecutive white-ball series defeat under new skipper Buttler, who recently succeeded now retired 50-over World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan, following Twenty20 and ODI reverses against India.
South Africa won the toss, with both sides unchanged after England’s thumping 118-run win in a rain-affected match at Old Trafford which followed the Proteas’ 62-run triumph at Chester-le-Street.
England made an early breakthrough when Janneman Malan (11) hit left-arm quick David Willey straight to Jason Roy at point to leave the Proteas 24-1.
But De Kock was in fine touch as he completed his first fifty of the series off just 39 balls, with the 29-year-old reaching the landmark by hitting boundaries off successive deliveries from leg-spinner Adil Rashid.
South Africa accelerated following the loss of Malan and were 89-1 by the time wicketkeeper De Kock reached his half-century.
Rassie van der Dussen, who made a career-best 134 in the series opener, shared a stand of 75 with De Kock before he holed out for 26 when sweeping against Rashid.
Rain first stopped play when South Africa were 119-2 in the 21st over.
De Kock deployed the reverse sweep to good effect when play resumed after a near two-hour delay had reduced the match reduced to 45 overs per side.
South Africa added a further 40 runs from 47 balls in 20 minutes of play before the rain returned to eventually end the match.
England and South Africa are scheduled to begin a three-game T20 series at Bristol on Wednesday.

Chandimal fell for 80, his fourth consecutive 50-plus score, but a string of cameos from their top and middle order kept Sri Lanka on course for a score around 350.
Pakistan could have been in a better position but skipper Babar Azam spilled two catches, including one from Niroshan Dickwella who was batting on a run-a-ball 42.
Debutant Dunith Wellalage was on six at the other end.
Earlier, electing to bat at the Galle International Stadium, Sri Lanka got off to a strong start with Oshada (50) and Dimuth Karunaratne (40) combining in a 92-run opening stand.
Oshada was particularly aggressive bringing up his fifty with a six off Mohammad Nawaz but fell caught behind to the very next delivery from the left-arm spinner. 
“If we can get 400 runs that will be a good total,” Oshada said after the day’s play. 
“That total will help us to put Pakistan under pressure. We need to get that total.”
Kusal Mendis departed on the stroke of lunch when bowler Agha Salman, trying to stop Karunaratne’s straight drive, deflected the ball onto the stumps at the non-striker’s end with Mendis short of crease.
Karunaratne was looking good for his fifty but he threw his wicket attemp­ting a reverse sweep off Yasir Shah.
Angelo Mathews, playing his 100th Test, batted aggressively and got a reprieve when Babar floored a sitter at cover when the batter was on 36.
Mathews could not capitalise on it though and was dismissed caught behind for 42 by Nauman Ali.
Chandimal took a single off Yasir to bring up his fifty and went on to hit the leg spinner for a couple of sixes.
A century looked on the cards but Chandimal paid for his ultra-aggression, top edging Nawaz trying to hit the spinner out of the park.
“The total is a bit more than our expectations. We had opportunities come our way but could not avail them,” Nawaz, who said it was  “rare” to see Azam drop catches, told reporters.
Nawaz added:  “There have been lapses, catches dropped, but still if we bowl them out in the first hour tomorrow then hopefully the score would not be much.” Nawaz expects the nature of the pitch to change on days three and four, which could help the opposition spinners be more effective in the Sri Lankan second innings.
Dhananjaya de Silva made 33 before losing his middle stump to Naseem Shah soon after Pakistan took the second new ball.
Shah was denied a second wicket when Babar dropped Dickwella, then on 24, in the slip. 
“In the morning Oshada attacked the spinners and he scored quickly,” said Nawaz.  “Then the partnership between Angelo Mathews and Chan­dimal was really effective for them.”
Pakistan have a 1-0 lead in the two-Tests series following their thrilling four-wicket victory in the series opener.

9,Vingegaard seals Tour de France glory,"PARIS: Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard won the Tour de France on Sunday, ending the reign of two-time defending ...","PARIS: Denmark’s Jonas Vingegaard won the Tour de France on Sunday, ending the reign of two-time defending champion Tadej Pogacar after a gruelling three weeks and 3,350km of relentless struggle.
The 25-year-old former fish-market worker Vingegaard claimed his first Tour de France a year after his break-out performance when he came second to Pogacar in 2021.
Belgium’s Jasper Philipsen won the dash for the line on the cobbled Champs Elysees to take the iconic final stage victory.
The ecstatic Philipsen lifted his bike aloft at the finish line after taking his second win of this Tour, turning the page on his embarrassment at mistakenly celebrating on stage four, when he had in fact finished second.
Vingegaard and his Jumbo-Visma team-mates all crossed the line together in a line and cheering wildly.
His Dutch team produced a brilliant collective effort with six stage wins, the green sprint jersey and the red combativity jersey for van Aert and the polka dot mountains jersey for Vingegaard as well as the overall title and yellow jersey.
After a relentless struggle over peaks and plains in a crushing heatwave, Vingegaard assured his win on Saturday’s time-trial having taken the lead in the Alps and extended it in the Pyrenees.
Defeated champion Pogacar finished second, won the best under-25s jersey for the third time and leaves this Tour with his reputation intact after attacking Vingegaard to the bitter end.
Geraint Thomas, the 2018 champion, was third after the veteran raced largely at his own pace, silencing doubters who thought that at 36, the affable Welshman was past his best.
STRUGGLE FOR SUPREMACY
The 21st stage was a largely ceremonial run as Vingegaard and others sipped champagne while rolling past sights of Paris including the Jardin du Luxembourg, through Saint Michel and past the Louvre before a sprint over eight laps of the Champs Elysees.
The Jumbo team had celebrated Saturday at their stop-over in Limoges but the triumph came after a long, collective effort that nearly fell flat at the last minute.
Vingegaard survived the  “heart attack” of a near fall on Saturday’s individual time-trial to virtually wrap up the Tour.
The two main protagonists had fought each other from start to finish, with Vingegaard dethroning Slovenian Pogacar with a pair of soaring performances in the high mountains.
Pogacar made all the early running with his lone wolf attacking mentality, gradually clawing his way into top spot on stage six with an air of invincibility.
But the stars aligned against Pogacar when he lost team-mates to Covid and injury. He is also a man known to dislike intense heat and temperatures hit 40 degrees during the final week of the race.
Vingegaard took the yellow jersey from Pogacar on stage 11 and while the UAE man refused stubbornly to give up, he lost further ground on stage 18.
Their epic struggle was highlighted by a moment of sportsmanship when Pogacar fell at high speed and Vingegaard waited for him to catch up, the pair clasping hands briefly in a memorable image from one of the best modern editions of the Tour.

Two other gold medallists from last year’s Tokyo Games had a mixed bag, Indian Neeraj Chopra having to content himself with silver in the men’s javelin, but Dutch runner Sifan Hassan leaving Eugene medal-less after finishing sixth in the women’s 5,000m.
The 4x100m relays saw the US women beat a loaded Jamaican team featuring individual sprint champions Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson, to win gold, but a Canada team anchored by Olympic 200m champion Andre de Grasse beat the favoured US men’s team into silver.
“It felt great to do it, to spoil the party for them,” said De Grasse, who contracted Covid-19 three weeks before the championships and was too fatigued to race the 200m.
“We talked about this moment so many times. We came up a little bit short at the Olympics, and we were all like, we could do better...it’s a good way to end the championship.” Korir produced a trademark kick from 200 metres out to win the men’s 800m in 1min 43.71sec, well ahead of Algerian Djamel Sedjati with silver and Canada’s Marco Arop bronze.
“I knew there were some guys close behind me in the last 100m,” Korir said.
“I was expecting someone to come, but no one did. I never shake my end in training but I do in races. It’s like magic. I have been working for this. It’s been a long wait -- I failed in 2017 and 2019 and I made it now.” Pichardo was imperious in the triple jump, all but tying up competition when he went out to 17.95 metres on his first attempt.
“I opened strongly,” the Cuban-born Pichardo said, adding that he had been mentally focused on the mythical 18-metre mark in a bid to better his two previous silvers.
“My mindset was focused on 18m. It did not come out today, but more importantly, I won gold. This world title was elusive to me.” In the absence of American multiple global medal winner Christian Taylor, world and Olympic bronze medallist Hugues Fabrice Zango of Burkina Faso claimed silver 40cm off Pichardo, while China’s Zhu Yaming took bronze.
Warner, also a winner in Tokyo, was in full control of the decathlon after four of the first day’s five events, but he pulled up injured in the 400m.
He was left lying on the track clutching his left hamstring.
Puerto Rico’s Ayden Owens-Delermew is now installed as the overnight leader, with the second day of action comprising the 110m hurdles, discus throw, pole vault, javelin throw and 1500m.
There was also no mercy shown in the women’s 5000m, where Ethiopia’s Gudaf Tsegay surged down the home straight to win in 14:46.29 ahead of Kenya’s Beatrice Chebet and another Ethiopian, Dawit Seyaum.
Olympic champion Hassan could only finish sixth, meaning she will depart Oregon not having made the podium in either the 5,000 or 10,000m.
Hassan produced a stunning 1,500m-10,000m double at the 2019 world championships in Doha before winning 5,000m and 10,000m gold and 1,500m bronze at last year’s Olympics in Tokyo.
But she admitted that she needed seven months out of competition after her exertions, both mental and physical.
“I really overworked last year so I wanted to get a break for my mental part because athletics is not only about running but also about motivation,” she said.
“It is so hard to get motivated again.” US track legend Allyson Felix, having deferred her retirement, played her part by helping the US women’s 4x400m relay qualify for Sunday’s final.
The US team won their heat in 3:23.38, Felix running the second leg, and will be joined in the finl by Britain, Jamaica, Belgium, Canada, Italy, France and Switzerland.
Should the US team medal, Felix stands to win her 20th world medal. Her overall world tally currently stands at 19 medals (13 gold, three silver, three bronze), including four individual golds.

The opening match of the tournament, played on July 16, had met the same fate. It meant Pakistan stayed unbeaten in the tournament as both teams shared two points each on both occasions.
Pakistan posted 94-8 in the stipulated 20 overs with skipper Bismah contributing 32 not out before Australia brisk start took them to 28-0. The latter’s pursuit of the target was halted as rain started pouring down at Bready Cricket Club ground in the fifth over.
Had the play went on for four more balls and five overs of play taken place, the result would have been determined on DLS method.
Pakistan are second on the tri-series points table with eight points under world champions Australia who have accumulated 12. Ireland, who were beaten by both teams earlier, remain in the last position.
After Pakistan won the toss and opted to bat first, openers Iram Javed and Muneeba Ali combined for 21 before the former departed for nine.
Muneeba carried on before falling after adding 19 off 23 with the help of two fours.
The only notable partnership for Pakistan was between captain Bismah and Aliya Riaz. The pair collaborated for 30 runs for the fifth wicket. 
For Australia, Jess Jonassen was the most successful bowler with match figures of 4-17. Nicola Carey bagged two wickets for 16 from her four overs.

12,Verstappen wins in France after Leclerc crashes out,LE CASTELLET: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won the French Grand Prix on Sunday and took a huge stride towards his...,"LE CASTELLET: Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won the French Grand Prix on Sunday and took a huge stride towards his second Formula One title after Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc made a costly mistake and crashed out while leading.
Seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton finished second for Mercedes in his 300th grand prix, with team-mate George Russell third to secure their first podium double of the campaign.
The victory on a hot afternoon at Le Castellet was Verstappen’s seventh of the season and 27th of his career.
It also left him a hefty 63 points — more than two race wins — clear of closest rival Leclerc at the top with 10 rounds remaining.
“I think we had really good pace from the start, I was putting pressure on Charles,” said the Dutch 24-year-old, who also won at the southern Circuit Paul Ricard last year.
“Following around here, with this heat, the tyres are overheating a lot so I could never really go for a move - only once.”  Leclerc had led away cleanly from pole position, with Verstappen close behind but needing six laps before he could get close enough to attempt a move.
While he pulled closer on the straights, Leclerc had an advantage through the corners and managed to remain just out of reach.
The Ferrari then appeared to be pulling away, but with some concern about tyre wear, as Verstappen made his first pitstop. And then it all changed on lap 18.
The Ferrari driver screamed in rage and frustration over the radio after his car spun mid-corner and plunged into the tyre barrier at the 11th corner, Le Beausset.
The Monegasque, hurting inside but otherwise intact, blamed only himself.
“I’ve been saying I think I’m performing at my highest level in my career but if I keep doing those mistakes then it’s pointless to perform at a very high level,” he told Sky Sports television.  “I’m losing too many points.”  The safety car was deployed briefly but from then on Verstappen was able to do his race and look after the tyres without much trouble.
Red Bull’s Sergio Perez finished fourth, losing out to Russell three laps from the end and complaining over the radio that the Briton had repeatedly gone off.
Carlos Sainz was fifth for Ferrari after starting on the back row due to engine penalties and storming back through the field with a bonus point for fastest lap.
