3,Senior Faisalabad airport official accused of violating CAA protocol,"Reportedly, the chief security officer his inspector violated protocol when they entered air traffic control without permission.","RAWALPINDI: The manager of Faisalabad International Airport has complained that the chief security officer (CSO) and his inspector violated Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)’s protocol when they allegedly entered the air traffic control (ATC) without permission.
The chief security officer (CSO), his armed guards and an inspector entered the ATC tower at about 12:15am on July 14 without authorisation, he said in a letter to the CAA.
The CAA has ordered an investigation into the allegation by the airport manager.
Irfan Mohyuddin, the airport manager, in his letter, available with Dawn, alleged that the CSO interfered in duty matters “with immensely arrogant behaviour and got into unnecessary arguments with the duty air traffic control officer (DATCO) that instigated an undue uproar.”
The air traffic control is well recognised as one of the most stressful jobs, requiring total concentration, peace of mind and a genial working environment. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) demands to ensure effective control of entry into all areas where air traffic control (ATC) operations are conducted, the letter added.
“The conduct of unauthorised access to the ATC tower is a vibrant breach of ICAO’s standard and station air traffic instructions, consequentially, it can compromise the flight safety,” said the airport manager.
Furthermore, the CSO of the airport is interfering with the work of other functionaries and the CAA, which are specialised responsibilities that neither a security officer can perform nor is required.
“It only creates hindrance in smooth airport operation/passenger facilitation.”
The manager observed that the CSO frequently visits the terminal building along with his personal security escort which consists of one guard but occasionally two guards are also with him in lounges with exposed weapons despite the fact that all arrival/departure lounges are in the sterilised area of the terminal building which is the safest zone.
He claimed that this activity makes passengers feel uneasy and unsafe, especially women and children. The norms of passenger facilitation set forth by the ICAO and PCAA are also violated, he added.
According to the letter, ASF’s lone employee, who is stationed at the very last counter at the departure lounges, is supposed to be unarmed but has been carrying a pistol for the past few days.
“This weapon is a constant threat and anyone may use it to meddle unlawfully or possibly endanger the safety of passengers in the lounge.
“It is recommended that ASF concerned quarters be contacted in order to cease this conduct which is against ICAO and PCAA protocols.”
The authority responsible for providing proper air traffic services (ATS)and conducting a smooth flight operation is the CAA director general or an authorised representative from his office.
When contacted, a spokesperson for the CAA said: “The matter has been looked into by the appropriate offices and their findings and conclusions, if shared, will be made available.”

4,RDA failed to launch any development project in last fiscal year,"Work on Ring Road, Rawal Expressway and Kutchery Chowk remodelling remains confined to PC-I preparations, says official...","RAWALPINDI: The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) failed to launch any project in the fiscal year 2021-22 and is yet to start any development work in the current year.
A senior RDA official told Dawn that last year there were three main projects entrusted to the civic body — Rawalpindi Ring Road, Rawal Expressway and Flood Channel and Kutchery Chowk Remodeling.
However, he said, work on these projects remained limited to the preparation of PC-I. Neither the previous PTI government nor the incumbent PML-N-led provincial government started work on roads and other infrastructures.
“In the last tenure of PML-N in Punjab, the RDA had completed work on improvement of Fawara Chowk parking plaza, Liaquat Bagh flyover and Double Road interchange. But, in the last four years, the civic agency did nothing,” he said.

Work on Ring Road, Rawal Expressway and Kutchery Chowk remodelling remains confined to PC-I preparations, says official

This fiscal year, Rawalpindi Ring Road project has been included by the federal government in the list of five projects for foreign investments.
“The fate of the remaining two projects is still hangs in the balance,” he said.
He said in May the RDA returned Rs7 billion to the Punjab government that had been released in the last fiscal year. 
The official said this year the government has allocated Rs500 million for the Kutchery Chowk project and Rs20 million for the Rawal Expressway and Flood Channel.
In the annual development programme of Punjab, there is no other project for Rawalpindi and the civic body will stick to the homework for these projects only, said the official.
Another RDA official told Dawn that in the last three weeks of the fiscal year 2022-23, the Punjab government did not carry out any work due to political unrest in the province.
The civic body would present development projects to the planning and development department but in the current situation the chief minister is reluctant to take decisions on any development work.
He said the local political leadership was not coming up to own the projects made by the previous government.
He said the role of the RDA was limited to approving building plans and issuing NOC for housing projects. He said the civic agency also failed to stop the mushroom growth of housing societies.
“There is planning on part of the RDA to save the green zone in and around the garrison city which has seen pollution,” he said.
When contacted, RDA spokesman Mohammad Irfan said that the government had allocated funds for three projects and the civic agency was working on it. However, he admitted that last year no development work was launched.

Having liking for the fruit, Saleh noted that mangoes of Rahim Yar Khan were the best in the world due to their taste. He showed his concern over the impact of climate change which has decreased mango production by almost 50 per cent. 
According to an announcement by the orchard management, Saleh visited Rahim Yar Khan along with his father and other family members on their invitation extended to him last year when he visited a mango exhibition arranged by the RYK chamber of commerce in the President House in Islamabad.  
“Saleh was much impressed last year after visiting the mango exhibition,” Malik Abdul Waheed, the director of the orchard, said.  
He said Mr Saleh spent whole the day in the orchard and collected information about different mango varieties. He had a detailed session with gardeners and other staff to learn about packing and grading facilities for the export of mango.
He was told that there were more than 100 mango varieties in the country but Chaunsa was the most sought after which was exported to several countries.
Waheed said mango orchards on 71,000 acres in Rahim Yar Khan district produced 35 per cent of total production of Punjab. But, he regretted, RYK could not get the status of mango zone like the citrus zone of Sargodha.
He said a cold store worth millions was inaugurated for mango exports by former CM Shahbaz Sharif near the Sheikh Zayed International Airport but it could not be completed, he told.

7,Teachers hit hard by cut in funds for rental ceiling,ISLAMABAD: A significant cut in funds of occupancy cost (rental ceiling) for educational institutions working under...,"ISLAMABAD: A significant cut in funds of occupancy cost (rental ceiling) for educational institutions working under the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) has created a difficult situation for teachers who are unable to pay rents from their own pockets amid prevailing inflation.
According to an official source, this has been a serious issue as funds have been decreased by over 50 per cent in many cases as compared to the previous year.
Funds for Islamabad Model College of Commerce H-8/4, for the current fiscal year 2022-23, have decreased by 75.4pc compared to the previous year. The college was allocated Rs2,709,000 whereas previously funds of Rs10,993,000 were allocated for it.
As many as 32 teachers of this college keep paying rent out of their own pockets fearing risk of eviction. However, this leaves them with less money to cover their basic expenses.
Islamabad Model Postgraduate College H-8/2 has been allocated Rs12,181,000 in the head of rental ceiling while it was allocated an amount of Rs20,518,000 last year. Islamabad Model College for Girls (Postgraduate) F-7/4 is also facing a cut in funds by 53pc in the current year. It was allocated Rs19,167,000 in the year 2021-22 while this time the allocation is Rs9,039,000.
Similarly, Islamabad Model College for Boys H-9 was allocated Rs 22,531,000 previously. In the current year, this amount was slashed to Rs16,719,000. 
IMCB Sihala was also granted a meagre amount of Rs3,473,000 which cannot cover the backlog of rent. IMCG (PG) G-10/4 and Islamabad College for Girls F-6/2 receive 20pc less amount as compared to the previous fiscal year. IMCB I-10/1 and IMCB F-10/3 also face 29.7pc and 28.7pc reduction in the allocated fund. 
According to Prof Farhan Azam, senior vice president of Federal Government College Teachers Association (FGCTA), despite the constant pending rent, funds allocated to it had decreased. 
Property owners are constantly riding on the nerves of teachers and repeatedly asking for the current and pending rent of their houses. In many cases, teachers have borrowed money from banks to pay rent which is a liability for the government. 
Anam Kaleem, joint secretary of FGCTA said for most teachers, rent is the biggest expenditure. Inflation has shot up in the country because of political and economic instability and our teachers are faced with pending rents, she said.
Dr Rahima Rehman, president FGCTA, said rising rents, fuel prices, external value of the rupee, prices of food and other necessities are drivers of inflation which hit people from low income groups hard. Soaring rents are compounding financial stress on low income teachers who depend upon rental ceiling provided by the government. Rents are rising at rates far above the rise in rental ceiling of teachers.
She urged the government to pay heeds to the issue by allocating a sufficient amount immediately to educational institutions. The FDE being the custodian of its employees should play its role to get funds, she said.

8,CDA to hire consultant for selection of landfill site,"Feasibility report to be prepared about sites in Bhara Kahu, Sangjani, near old airport, Mandra...","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has decided to hire a consultant for selection of a new landfill site as shifting of the existing dumping site in I-12 is imperative after start of development work in the stalled sector.
“We are going to hire a consultant for feasibility and selection of a suitable site. We have identified four sites and the consultant will pick one of them,” said CDA Director General Shahjahan Khan.
Talking toDawnon Sunday, Mr Khan said the consultant would prepare feasibility report of four sites - Bhara Kahu, Sangjani, near Old Airport and another near Mandra.
“We have also decided that the new site will be a proper engineering and scientific landfill site. The existing one in I-12 is a dumping site, not a proper landfill site,” he said.

Feasibility report to be prepared about sites in Bhara Kahu, Sangjani, near old airport, Mandra

It is relevant to note here that the CDA has been dumping around 600 tonnes of garbage and waste daily in I-12, which has remained a stalled sector for years, however, recently the civic body started development work in this sector. Therefore, shifting of the dumping site, which is almost filled to its capacity, has become imperative.
Last year, the CDA decided to set up a temporary site in H-16, but the locals of the area filed a court case against the authority. Later, it was decided that the site will not be established in H-16.
Meanwhile, the civic agency had also proposed setting up a site on its nursery land along Park Road, but after a few meetings, this site was also termed not suitable.
It is relevant to note here that the CDA continues to receive criticism from residents for questionably reversing its decision of setting up a permanent landfill site after finalising a site in Kuri in 2011.
For over 10 years, makeshift arrangements have been made for dumping waste at temporary locations. The Kuri site was selected after many meetings and on the basis of reports of the consultant, but in a highly dubious manner, CDA in 2011, citing objection of an environment body, decided not to go for it.
Some officials of that time had alleged that this decision of not setting up the site in Kuri area was made to appease administrations of private housing societies. Since then, the CDA is shifting the temporary site from one place to another.
A few years ago, the civic agency proposed a site in Sangjani, but the environment body after receiving public complaints rejected the proposal. Later, the CDA proposed a site in the institutional sector of H-16, but Islamabad High Court (IHC) issued a stay order.
Now, CDA has decided to hire a consultant for feasibility report and selection of a suitable site. Meanwhile, the authority is working towards setting up a landfill site near Mandra, Chakwal as a joint venture with Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA). Last year, both civic agencies held meetings on this subject.

9,No let-up in Pindi cantt residents’ water woes,"""We are facing water shortage despite heavy rains in the garrison city,"" says one resident.","RAWALPINDI: While there is enough water in Rawal and Khanpur dams after heavy rains in the twin cities, water shortage in cantonment areas continues.
“We are facing water shortage despite heavy rains in the garrison city but the water branch of Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) claims that there is a shortage of water from Khanpur Dam,” said Mohammad Azmat, a resident of Aliabad near Peshawar Road.
Ahmed Kamal, a resident of Tench Bhatta, said that the tubewell operator did not open supply for more than 15 minutes and it was difficult for people to fill their underground water tanks.
He said people had no other option but to buy water through private tankers. 
He said people had to spend an amount of Rs5,000 to Rs6,000 every month on water tankers and RCB charges the residents regularly without providing them water.
The situation in Chaklala Cantonment area is equally bad. 
There are limited tubewells as underground water is not available in the area and people have to rely on private tankers.
“A supply system exists in most areas but water is not supplied,” said Mohammad Anwar, a resident of Kamalabad, adding roads and streets were in bad shapes and there was no water supply in thickly-populated areas. 
CCB’s former vice president Raja Irfan Imtiaz told Dawn that elected members of the cantonment were worried about shortage of water but there was no solution.
He said water was being supplied to residents from Khanpur Dam, adding tubewells in the cantonment area were not enough. 
He said elected members must request the government to chalk out a plan to provide water from other dams to end the shortage of water.

11,Completion of work on Rawal Dam Interchange flyover by July end ordered,The project was expected to conclude by Oct this year but PM Shehbaz moved up the deadline by a month.,"ISLAMABAD: Capital Development Authority (CDA) Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed on Sunday directed the engineering wing of the civic body to wrap up construction work on the Rawal Dam Interchange project by August 30, especially the flyover that he wanted to be up and running by the end of this month.
Chairman Ahmed, Member Engineering Syed Munawar Shah and other officers of CDA visited the construction site to inspect the speed of the work.
In April, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the CDA to complete the project by the first week of September by all means necessary. 
The project, worth Rs1.1 billion, was inaugurated in July 2020, but work on it formally began in October. The project was expected to conclude by Oct this year but the premier moved up the deadline by a month.
It was also decided that the FWO would complete the project at the same amount - Rs1.1 billion - on which it was awarded to the former contractor who quit the project midway.
In order to meet the deadline fixed by PM Sharif, the CDA management has ramped up the work on the project.
“We are planning to open the overpass/flyover to traffic on July 31. While the entire project will be completed by the end of August for its final inauguration which is likely to take place in the first week of September,” said an officer of the CDA. 
The CDA had faced a setback when contractors – a joint venture of two companies – stopped construction work halfway earlier this year due to a hike in the prices of construction material. 
The work remained suspended for a couple of months before being taken over by the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and National Logistics Cell (NLC) at the request of the civic body.
It is relevant to note that the current CDA administration has been awarding major contracts either to the FWO or the NLC under 42(F) ofPPRArules. Currently, both construction companies have been executing projects of CDA worth billions of rupees.
Referring to the award of the Rawal Road project to private companies, a CDA engineer commented that the civic body’s experience with the private contractors was “disappointing” which made the authority look towards the army-run companies for timely completion of the project. “Now, we are satisfied that work will be completed by end of August,” he said while commenting on the FWO.

12,Senate committee to take up PIA’s Rs700m deal,It will also look into reasons for closing PIA’s Hyderabad booking office and the non-operational Mohenjodaro airport.,"ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee this week will inquire what it believes was Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)’s dubious Rs700 million deal for the development of an indigenous in-flight entertainment system.
Besides, the Senate Standing Committee on Aviation would also look into reasons for closing PIA’s Hyderabad booking office and the non-operational Mohenjodaro airport.
In 2020, a decision was taken by the national flag carrier that its Boeing-777 aircraft would get new Inflight Entertainment System (IFE) at a modest cost of Rs700 million. This was to help PIA compete on its long-haul flights to Europe and in time to the United States. PIA claimed that its advantage lay in its direct shorter duration flights. However, the absence of the IFI system had badly affected PIA’s revenues.
The measures were necessary as part of its turnaround and in its bid to improve its image and increase its revenues.
PIA’s long haul flights had been without an effective IFE system for quite some time creating embarrassing scenes.
Besides, the absence of IFE system had been adversely affecting PIA’s ability to provide a standard expected flying experience and thus eroding what is called in aviation language the seat factor.
PIA’s competitors on these lucrative routes such as Emirates, Etihad and Qatar offered top of the line entertainment systems with hundreds of choices from movies, dramas, music and games.
The Senate committee would also take up questions raised by senators Naseebullah Bazai Tangi and Behramand Khan about the appointment of the current director general Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) who the lawmakers believed was not qualified for the position.
The two members had also demanded answers to specific questions regarding the postings of the incumbent DG in the last 15 years.
They also asked for details of the staff appointed with the DG, their qualifications, grades and modes of appointment.

Taxila police registered a case against a sub-inspector for faulty investigation against a suspect, who was booked and arrested under S 9(c) of Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997.
According to police sources, the said officer did not collect evidence and this resulted in the suspect’s bail from court.
In another case, an official of Wah Cantonment police station was arrested and sent behind bars after his bail plea over his alleged involvement in raping a woman through a forged marriage contract was rejected.
The victim lodged a first investigation report (FIR) against an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in 2021 under sections 376, 420, 467, 468 and 471 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for raping her. The policeman’s bail was rejected by Additional Sessions Judge Khalid Mehmood Cheema after which he fled from the court.
Consequently, he was declared a proclaimed offender (PO) and was dismissed from service. A departmental inquiry was initiated against him. 
The ASI was later arrested by Sub-Inspector Touseef of Wah Cantonment police station.
