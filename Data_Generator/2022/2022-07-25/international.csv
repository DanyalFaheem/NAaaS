0,North Korea accuses US of biological warfare in Ukraine,Moscow in March accused Washington of funding research into the development of biological weapons in Ukraine.,"SEOUL: North Korea accused the United States on Sunday of manufacturing biological weapons in Ukraine, echoing a Russian claim dismissed by the United Nations in March.  
Moscow ally Pyongyang in February said US policy was the “root cause of the Ukraine crisis”, and this month formally recognised two self-proclaimed pro-Russian separatist regions in eastern Ukraine, prompting Kyiv to cut diplomatic ties with North Korea.  
Washington “set up many biological labs in tens of countries and regions, including Ukraine, in disregard of the international treaties”, the official Korean Central News Agency said on Sunday, citing what it said had been “detected” by Russia.  
Moscow in March accused Washington of funding research into the development of biological weapons in Ukraine, which has invaded by Russia nearly five months ago.  
Washington and Kyiv denied the existence of laboratories intended to produce biological weapons in Ukraine, with the United States saying the allegations were a sign that Moscow may use such tactics itself.  
Izumi Nakamitsu, the UN’s Under-Secretary-Gen­eral of Disarmament Affairs, also said in March that the UN “was not aware of any biological weapons programme in Ukraine”.

1,3 killed in shooting at Philippine varsity,"Rose Furigay, a former city mayor, was among those killed, authorities say.","MANILA: Three people were killed on Sunday in a rare shooting at a university in the Philippine capital Manila, officials said, in what appears to have been a targeted assassination.
The incident happened at Ateneo de Manila University as law students and their families arrived for a graduation ceremony that was to be attended by the Supreme Court chief justice. Rose Furigay, a former city mayor in the restive southern province of Basilan and whose daughter was among the graduates, was killed, authorities said. Furigay’s executive assistant and a university security guard were also killed.
Her daughter was wounded and is in a  “stable condition” in hospital, police said.
“We are quite distraught and bereaved by this occurrence,” Joy Belmonte, the mayor of a local government unit where the shooting happened, said. The alleged gunman fled the scene by forcing a driver out of their vehicle, before abandoning it and continuing his getaway in a jeepney, police said. He was eventually detained near a church.
Police recovered two handguns and a silencer allegedly used by the suspect, who they identified as Chao-Tiao Yumol and said had a  “long history” of legal disputes with Furigay. Yumol was on bail for a cyberlibel charge. “This looks to be a determined assassin,” Police Brigadier General Remus Medina told reporters, describing the incident as  “isolated”.
Yumol, with abrasions on his face, was presented by police to reporters. He accused Furigay of being a  “drug lord”.
School and university shootings are rare in the Philippines despite its lax gun rules. But targeted killings of politicians are fairly common, particularly during elections. Furigay, whose family dominates politics in Lamitan City, served three terms as mayor and was prevented by the constitution from seeking re-election in the May 9 polls.
She was succeeded by her husband, who had held the position before her — a common occurrence in the Philippines where powerful clans hand positions from one family member to another to maintain their influence. Ateneo de Manila University cancelled the graduation ceremony.

2,Congestion eases at Dover port,"LONDON: Officials at the English Channel port of Dover on Sunday said operations had returned to normal, after two...","LONDON: Officials at the English Channel port of Dover on Sunday said operations had returned to normal, after two days of lengthy delays blamed on post-Brexit border checks.
Frustrated holidaymakers were forced to wait for hours to reach the port and board ferries to France on Friday and Saturday, at the start of the busy summer getaway.
The UK government blamed France for failing to adequately staff their border posts at the port, prompting a swift denial from Paris.
The Port of Dover said the backlogs of freight and tourists from the last two days had been cleared overnight, although it said Sunday would remain  “busy”.
Some 72,000 passengers — the equivalent of 200 miles (320 kilometres) of traffic — had gone through the port already this weekend, it added.
“With the entire port system working efficiently, including strong support from French border colleagues and ferries running through the night, the Port demonstrated that its summer plan will work for the rest of the holiday period,” the port said in a statement.
Eurotunnel, however, warned of delays to its rail shuttle service between nearby Folkestone and Coquelles in northern France, with motorists facing long queues to get to the terminal. There were fears about chronic delays at Britain’s ports even before the country left the European Union in full on Jan 1 last year.

3,Evacuation alert after volcano erupts in Japan,TOKYO: Dozens of people were urged to evacuate their homes after a fiery volcanic eruption in southern Japan on...,"TOKYO: Dozens of people were urged to evacuate their homes after a fiery volcanic eruption in southern Japan on Sunday as the national weather agency issued its top-level alert for the mountain.
Television footage showed red-hot rocks and dark plu­mes exploding from Sakur­ajima volcano in Kagoshima, which erupted just after 8 pm. There were no immediate reports of damage, said deputy chief cabinet secretary Yoshihiko Isozaki.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has instructed the government  “to work closely with the local municipality to ensure damage prevention, such as through evacuations,” Isozaki told reporters.
The volcano frequently spits out smoke and ash, and is a major tourist attraction.
Sunday’s blast propelled large cinders about 2.5 kilometres from the crater, the Japan Meteorological Age­ncy (JMA) said, while the smoke reached around 300 metres and merged with the clouds. The agency raised its alert for Sakurajima to level five, the top level, which urges evacuations. Previously it was at level three, which bans entry to the mountain.

4,What is behind the heatwaves affecting United States?,Virtually all the contiguous United States experienced above normal temperatures in the past week.,"Virtually all the contiguous United States experienced above normal temperatures in the past week, with more dangerously hot weather forecast.
The US heatwave followed record heat that killed hundreds if not thousands of people and sparked wildfires in Europe.
Following is an explanation of what is causing the heatwaves, according to scientists.
What is a heatwave?
A heatwave has no single scientific definition. Depending on the climate of a region, it can be determined by a certain number of days above a specific temperature or percentile of the norm.
Arctic warming and jet stream migration
The Arctic is warming three to four times faster than the globe as a whole, meaning there is ever less difference between northern temperatures and those closer to the equator.
That is resulting in swings in the North Atlantic jet stream, which in turn leads to extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods, according to Jennifer Francis, senior scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Centre.
Heat domes
Warmer oceans contribute to heat domes, which trap heat over large geographical areas. This weekend the heat dome is stretching from the southern plains of the Oklahoma/Arkansas area all the way to the eastern seaboard, according to the US Weather Prediction Centre.
Scientists have found the main cause of heat domes is a strong change in ocean temperatures from west to east in the tropical Pacific Ocean during the preceding winter.
“As prevailing winds move the hot air east, the northern shifts of the jet stream trap the air and move it toward land, where it sinks, resulting in heat waves,” the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says on its website.
El Nio and La Nia
Every few years, the climate patterns known as El Nio and, less frequently, La Nia occur. El Nio brings warm water from the equatorial Pacific Ocean up to the western coast of North America, and La Nia brings colder water.
At present, La Nia is in effect. Because summer temperatures trend lower during La Nia, climate scientists are concerned about what a serious heatwave would look like during the next El Nio, when even hotter summer weather could be expected.
Human-influenced climate change
Climate change caused by the burning of fossil fuels is a global phenomenon that is certainly playing a role in what the United States is experiencing, scientists say.
“Climate change is making extreme and unprecedented heat events both more intense and more common, pretty much universally throughout the world,” said Daniel Swain, climate scientist at UCLA.
“Heatwaves are probably the most underestimated type of potential disaster because they routinely kill a lot of people. And we just don’t hear about it because it doesn’t kill them in, to put it bluntly, sufficiently dramatic ways. There aren’t bodies on the street.”  Francis, of the Woodwell Centre, said with climate change the world is seeing changing wind patterns and weather systems  “in ways that make these heatwaves, like we’re seeing right now, more intense, more persistent, and cover areas that just aren’t used to having heat waves.” 
Alex Ruane, researcher at Nasa’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said as the world warms,  “it takes less of a natural anomaly to push us into the extreme heat categories. Because we’re closer to those thresholds, it’s more likely that you’ll get more than one heatwave at the same time. We’re seeing this in the United States.”

5,"Closure of Jewish agency will hurt Israel-Russia ties, says Lapid","Closing of the agency will be a ""serious event"" that would affect relations, he tells meeting of senior officials.","JERUSALEM: A Russian decision to shut down an agency that processes the immigration of Jews to Israel would be a  “serious event” impacting bilateral ties, Prime Minister Yair Lapid said on Sunday.
A Moscow court said last week that the justice ministry had requested the  “dissolution” of the Jewish Agency because of unspecified legal violations, and set a hearing for July 28.
Some experts interpreted that as a warning shot from the Kremlin towards Lapid, who has taken a tougher rhetorical line over the Ukraine conflict than Israel’s former premier Naftali Bennett, who stepped aside on July 1.
Lapid told a meeting of senior officials that  “closing the Jewish Agency offices would be a serious event that would affect relations”, a government statement said.
He also ordered that a  “legal delegation be prepared to depart for Moscow as soon as the Russian approval for talks is received and to make every effort to exhaust the legal dialogue”, on top of diplomatic efforts to ease the dispute.
The Jewish Agency, established in 1929, played a key role in the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.
It began working in Russia in 1989, two years before the end of the Soviet Union, after which hundreds of thousands of Jews from all over the USSR left for Israel.
More than a million Israeli citizens today are originally from the Soviet Union.
Closing the agency’s Russian branch would not stop Russian Jews from moving to Israel — only a full Russian border closure could achieve that — but it could slow down the process.
Immediately following the February 24 invasion of Ukraine, Lapid as foreign minister accused Russia of violating the  “world order”, while Bennett stressed Israel’s strong relations with both sides, withheld direct criticism of the invasion and subsequently tried to play a role of mediator between Kyiv and Moscow.
Lapid has renewed his criticism of Russia since becoming prime minister, but has still tried to walk a cautious line in order to preserve ties with Moscow, which are seen as crucial to preserving Israel’s ability to carry out air strikes in Syria where Russian forces are present.

6,"Italy sees influx of 1,000 migrants in one day","ROME: More than a thousand migrants arrived in Italy within a few hours while hundreds of others, rescued by...","ROME: More than a thousand migrants arrived in Italy within a few hours while hundreds of others, rescued by humanitarian vessels, were waiting for a port to receive them, NGOs and authorities said on Sunday. 
Among these migrants are also the people from Pakistan and Afghanistan. The influx — while not unusual for the summer months — this year comes as Italy gears up for early elections which could bring the hard right to power.
Between January 1 and July 22, 34,000 people arrived in Italy by sea compared with 25,500 during the same period in 2021 and 10,900 in 2020, Italy’s interior ministry said.
More than 600 people attempting to cross the Mediterranean on board a drifting fishing vessel were rescued on Saturday by a merchant vessel and coastguards off Calabria, at the southern tip of Italy. They were landed in several ports in Sicily. The authorities also recovered five bodies of migrants who had died in so far undetermined circumstances.
On the island of Lampedusa, some 522 people from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia, among others, arrived from the late hours of Saturday in 15 different boats from Tunisia and Libya. 
According to the Italian media, the island’s reception centre has been overwhelmed. With a capacity of 250-300 people, it currently hosts 1,200, according to the Ansa news agency. 
According to La Sicilia daily, the latest arrivals on Lampedusa came both by ships carrying dozens, even hundreds of people, as well as by small inflatable boats. Four Tunisians, including one woman, ran aground during the night on the beach of Cala Pisana after crossing the stretch of sea separating Tunisia and the Italian island, the daily said. 
At the same time, it said that coastguards had intercepted a 13-metre ship which had departed from the northwestern Libyan city of Zawiya with 123 people from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and Sudan on board. Offshore NGOs continued to recover hundreds of migrants in distress in the Mediterranean. SeaWatch reported that it had carried out four rescue operations on Saturday.
“On board SeaWatch3, we have 428 people, including women and children, a woman nine months pregnant and a patient with severe burns,” it said on its Twitter account.
OceanViking, operated by non-governmental organisation SOS Mediterranean, reported that it had recovered 87 people, including 57 unaccompanied minors, who were crammed onto “an overcrowded inflatable boat in distress in international waters off Libya”.
The Central Mediter­ranean migration route is the most dangerous in the world.
The International Organisation for Migration estimates that 990 people have died and disappeared since the beginning of the year. The latest inflow of migrants comes at a politically sensitive time in Italy.
Reformist Prime Minister Mario Draghi resigned last week after being toppled by parties in his national unity government.
Italian President Sergio Mattarella has dissolved parliament and set September 25 for new elections to be held.

7,An old political prisoner warns against new Tunisian constitution,"TUNIS: Hamma al-Hammami knows the peril Tunisia risks if it slides back into autocracy, as he and opposition parties...","TUNIS: Hamma al-Hammami knows the peril Tunisia risks if it slides back into autocracy, as he and opposition parties warn it may do if President Kais Saied passes his draft constitution in a referendum on Monday.
Hammami, a leftist political leader, was repeatedly imprisoned and tortured from 1972 until the 2011 revolution that brought democracy to Tunisia — a moment he experienced from inside an Interior Ministry cell hearing the crowd roar outside.
Now, he says, the struggle for freedom must resume after a decade in which Tunisians could say what they pleased, criticise their leaders and vote in fair elections. “He is a sultan, not a president,” he said of Saied. “The struggle for freedom and dignity will start again.” 
Saied says his moves since last year to dismiss the parliament, take over government, rule by decree and rewrite the constitution — which his critics call a coup — were necessary to save Tunisia from years of stagnation.
While Tunisians have embraced the rights they won in 2011, they have suffered from economic decline, corruption and political in-fighting.
Saied has repeatedly vowed not to become a dictator and has said he will uphold the rights and freedoms secured after the 2011 revolution when autocratic leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted.
However, his draft constitution brings nearly all powers under the president, removing most checks on his authority. While it guarantees freedoms in one clause, it makes them subject to new laws or undefined security needs in another.
There has been no widespread crackdown on dissent, banning of press or mass arrests of Saied’s opponents, but rights groups have concerns.
Last week Amnesty International warned against what it called an  “alarming backsliding on human rights”, while a UN rapporteur on judicial independence also warned this month that Saied’s moves to bring the body overseeing judges under his control has raised concerns over the right to a fair trial.
Now 70, Hammami has been a political activist since his student days when he was arrested in 1972 under Tunisia’s first leader after independence, Habib Bourguiba, for protesting against state control of university organisations.
Accused of conspiring against state security, he was trussed  “like a chicken”, beaten repeatedly including on the head and genitals, and burned with cigarettes, for hours, he said.
After a month of solitary confinement, torture and execution threats, including being thrown into an open grave with soil flung onto his body, he was released onto the streets of the capital.
Walking down the central Habib Bourguiba Avenue, where the Interior Ministry is located and where most major protests have taken place, he decided to devote himself to political activism.
Rising in Tunisia’s Communist movement, eventually becoming head of the Workers’ Party, he was imprisoned and tortured during 1974-80.
Though Bourguiba later publicly acknowledged that Hammami had been tortured, the persecution continued after Ben Ali seized power in 1987 as he spent years alternately in prison or in hiding, constantly changing his appearance and location.
When Tunisians rose up in December 2010 and January 2011, outraged by the self-immolation of a street seller, Hammami was again detained and taken to the same Interior Ministry cells.
“I heard the people like waves in the sea,” he said, tears pricking his eyes, of the tens of thousands rushing down Habib Bourguiba Avenue the day Ben Ali fled as Hammami listened from the cells.
The revolution began a new phase of his life. His wife, human rights lawyer Radhia Nasraoui, was feted by foreign countries and he was offered positions in the new democratic governments. He turned them down and remained a vocal critic of successive governments, particularly of the Islamist Ennahda party that is now also a leading foe of Saied and the new constitution.
On Friday evening Hammami joined a small protest of political figures and civil society organisations against the referendum. “Shut down Kais Saied,” Hammami chanted with the others, marching down Habib Bourguiba Avenue towards the Interior Ministry where he had so often been imprisoned.
Hours after Hammami said the struggle for freedom would start again, the police set upon his group of protesters, using pepper spray, sticks and arrests to disperse the demonstration.

8,Fierce wildfires ravage Greece amid heatwave,The fire has already destroyed nearly 500 hectares of woodland.,"ATHENS: Greece on Sunday battled three wildfires across the country which forced hundreds to evacuate, as soaring temperatures raised fears of more blazes.
The country is in the grip of a heatwave that began on Saturday and is expected to last 10 days. Temperatures were set to rise to 42 degrees Celsius (107 degrees Fahrenheit) in some regions.
Experts blame climate change for the soaring temperatures and warned that the worst is yet to come.
Fires raged in the north, east and south of Greece, including on the island of Lesbos.
Officials ordered the evacuation of around 200 people on Sunday afternoon from Vryssa village on Lesbos as flames crept closer, some 500 metres (1,600 feet) from houses, the deputy mayor of western Lesbos told Skai radio.
Elderly women carried plastic bags with only a few personal belongings as they boarded the first buses to leave the village. Thick clouds of smoke were already engulfing the first houses of Vryssa.
The blaze broke out a day earlier, causing the evacuation of hundreds of tourists and residents from the beachside village of Vatera.
At least four houses were destroyed in Vatera, state TV ERT reported, and fires damaged an unknown number of shops, hotels and beach bars in the village.
Dozens of firefighters early on Sunday clamoured to control the blaze, with four water-dropping planes and two helicopters in operation.
In the northeastern region of Evros, a wildfire was ablaze for a fourth day in Dadia National Park, known for its black vulture colony.
The fire has already destroyed nearly 500 hectares (1,220 acres) of woodland.
More than 300 firefighters battled to control the fire in Evros and by late Saturday the thick smoke forced the evacuation of the village of Dadias. It was unclear how many people were evacuated.
“The most important thing for us is the safety of the villagers and all forces (which) will be deployed there,” Evros governor Dimitris Petrovits told Athens News Agency.
The fire had already passed the raptor birds observatory and was closing in on the buildings of the protected area management unit. Petrovits said collecting and treating injured animals was a high priority for the authorities.
In the Peloponnese, a southern peninsula, a fire that broke out early Saturday forced the evacuation of Chrysokelaria village. By midday on Sunday, firefighters had managed to contain the fire.
A wildfire in mountains near Athens on Wednesday also damaged homes and forced hundreds of people to evacuate after gale-force winds earlier in the week.
Greece’s worst wildfire disaster killed 102 people in 2018 in the coastal suburb of Mati, east of Athens.
The latest fires come after a heatwave and wildfires last year destroyed 103,000 hectares and claimed three lives in Greece.
Fires in parts of France, Spain and Portugal have already burned more land so far this year than was destroyed by flames in all of 2021. The area, some 517,881 hectares, is equivalent to the size of Trinidad and Tobago.

9,Pope heads to Canada to make amends for Indigenous school scandal,"He will be joined on the visit by his diplomacy chief, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s second most senior official.","ABOARD PLANE: Pope Francis left Rome on Sunday for Canada for a chance to personally apologise to Indigenous survivors of abuse committed over a span of decades at residential schools run by the Catholic Church.
The head of the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics will be met at Edmonton’s international airport by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The Pope’s plane took off from Rome shortly after 9am local time.
The 10-hour flight constitutes the longest since 2019 for the 85-year-old pope, who has been suffering from knee pain that has forced him to use a cane or wheelchair in recent outings.
The pope was in a wheelchair on Sunday and used a lifting platform to board the plane, a correspondent accompanying him said.
Pope Francis’ Canada visit is primarily to apologise to survivors for the Church’s role in the scandal that a national truth and reconciliation commission has called  “cultural genocide”.
Before he left, the pope said on Twitter he was making a  “penitential pilgrimage” that  “might contribute to the journey of reconciliation already undertaken”. He will be joined on the visit by his diplomacy chief, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s second most senior official.
From the late 1800s to the 1990s, Canada’s government sent about 150,000 First Nations, Metis and Inuit children into 139 residential schools run by the Church, where they were cut off from their families, language and culture. Many were physically and sexually abused by headmasters and teachers.
Thousands of children are believed to have died of disease, malnutrition or neglect.
Since May 2021, more than 1,300 unmarked graves have been discovered at the sites of the former schools.

10,Russian FM reassures Egypt on grain delivery,Between 20 million and 25 million tonnes of grain have been blocked in Ukrainian ports since Russian troops invaded in February.,"CAIRO: Russia’s top diplomat reassured Egyptian leaders on Sunday that their orders for Russian grain would be met as he began a tour of African countries dependent on imports for their food supply.
“We confirmed the commitment of Russian exporters of cereal products to meet their orders in full,” Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a news conference after talks with Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry.
“President Vladimir Putin stressed this during a recent telephone call with Egyptian President (Abdel Fattah) al-Sisi.” Lavrov’s visit comes hot on the heels of a landmark deal Russia and Ukraine signed on Friday with the United Nations and Turkey aimed at relieving a global food crisis caused by blocked Black Sea grain deliveries.
Between 20 million and 25 million tonnes of grain have been blocked in Ukrainian ports since Russian troops invaded in February, as Ukraine has laid naval mines to prevent an amphibious invasion of its coast.
The deal provides for the creation of safe corridors for grain exports from three Ukrainian ports, and also seeks to facilitate Russian grain exports by removing them from the scope of Western sanctions.
“The (UN) secretary general (Antonio Guterres) took responsibility for lifting these illicit restrictions, imposed by the United States and the European Union against (Russian) financial and supply chains,” Lavrov said.
Before Russia invaded 
Ukraine, the two countries accounted for 85 percent of wheat imports to Egypt, which has been heavily impacted by what 
Lavrov called  “the so-called world food crisis” in an address to the Arab League in Cairo later Sunday.
Lavrov met Arab League head Ahmed Aboul Gheit and representatives of the 22 nations that make up the pan-Arab bloc.
The United States has sought to isolate Russia on the global stage over its invasion of Ukraine, but has faced less success in the Arab world, where many countries are hesitant to strain relations with Moscow.
Many such as Egypt have not clearly sided with either Russia or Ukraine, leading Lavrov on Sunday to praise Arab countries’ and the League’s  “balanced, fair, responsible position”.
Several member states are heavily dependent on wheat imports from Ukraine and have been reeling from food insecurity, which Lavrov said Sunday had been  “bluntly, unconditionally” blamed on Russia,  “as if the food crisis started on the day we launched our special military operation in Ukraine”.
In addition to the coronavirus pandemic and supply chain problems, the diplomat said the crisis  “was aggravated by the illegal Western sanctions against the Russian Federation”.
Despite a Russian strike on Ukraine’s port of Odessa Saturday, which Kyiv called a  “spit in the face” to the freshly inked deal with Turkey and the UN, Lavrov lauded the agreement Sunday.
He told Arab leaders it will compel  “Western countries to lift limitations and stop preventing Russian grain from being delivered to the buyers”.
After Egypt, Russia’s top diplomat is to visit Uganda, Ethiopia and Congo.

Scores of spectators watched the racing on a 200 metre-long dirt track in the seaside province of Chonburi, some 80 km southeast of the capital, Bangkok.
The race, which sometimes takes place at the end of the monsoon, was paused during the coronavirus pandemic but returned last year.
Most Thai farmers no longer use water buffalo for farming but many are still keen to keep the animals.
“Today, it doesn’t matter for for me if I win or lose. I wanted to preserve this tradition,” said Somchai Kamchab, 58, who owns a buffalo competing in the race.
