0,California wildfire grows as US bakes in record heat,"More than 6,000 people evacuated, 2,000 firefighters, backed by 17 helicopters, deployed against Oak Fire.","LOS ANGELES: A fierce California wildfire expanded overnight into Sunday, burning several thousand acres and forcing evacuations, as millions of Americans sweltered through scorching heat with already record-setting temperatures due to climb even further. 
More than 2,000 firefighters backed by 17 helicopters have been deployed against the Oak Fire, which broke out on Friday in California near Yosemite National Park, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Calfire) said in a report. 
But two days after it began the blaze had already consumed more than 14,200 acres and remained zero percent contained, the report said, adding that heat combined with low humidity would “hamper” efforts on Sunday. 
“Extreme drought conditions have lead to critical fuel moisture levels,” according Calfire’s report. 
Described as “explosive” by officials, the blaze has left ashes, gutted vehicles and twisted remains of properties in its wake, as emergency personnel worked to evacuate residents and protect structures in its path.

It has already destroyed 10 properties and damaged five others, with thousands more threatened. More than 6,000 people had been evacuated, said Hector Vasquez, a Calfire official. “There’s personnel showing up from various departments all over the state to help control this fire,” Vasquez said, adding that the situation remained “really challenging.” 
California Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday declared a state of emergency in Mariposa County, citing “conditions of extreme peril to the safety of persons and property.” In recent years, California and other parts of the western United States have been ravaged by huge and fast-moving wildfires, driven by years of drought and a warming climate. 
Evidence of global warming could be seen elsewhere in the country, as 85 million Americans in more than a dozen states were under a weekend heat advisory. 
The crisis prompted former vice president Al Gore, a tireless climate advocate, to issue stark warnings Sunday about “inaction” by US lawmakers. 
Asked whether he believes US President Joe Biden should declare a climate emergency, as Biden has said he soon might, Gore was blunt. 
“Mother Nature has already declared it a global emergency,” he told ABC News talk show “This Week.” And “it’s due to get much, much worse, and quickly,” he said on NBC. 
But he also suggested that recent crises, including deadly heat waves in Europe, could serve as a wake-up call for members of Congress who have so far refused to embrace efforts to combat climate change. “I think these extreme events that are getting steadily worse and more severe are really beginning to change minds,” he said. 
The central and northeast US regions face the brunt of the ongoing extreme temperatures, which were not expected to peak until Sunday and have sent public health officials scrambling. 
“Numerous records highs are forecast to be tied and/or broken today in the Northeast as highs make a run at the century mark and heat indices range between 105-110 degrees (40.5-43.3 Celsius),” the National Weather Service said on Sunday. 
A heat emergency is in effect for cities up and down the northeast coast, from Boston to Philadelphia to Washington.
Not even the usually cool Pacific Northwest will escape the far-reaching heat, with the region expected to face several days in the 90s next week. 
Cities have been forced to open cooling stations and increase outreach to at-risk communities such as the homeless and those without access to air conditioning.
Various regions of the globe have been hit by extreme heat waves in recent months, such as Western Europe in July and India in March to April, incidents that scientists say are an unmistakable sign of a warming climate.

1,Israeli forces kill two Palestinians in West Bank,Israeli army says it carried out operations and used live fire in several locations; Red Crescent treating 19 wounded.,"NABLUS: Israeli forces killed two Palestinians during an overnight raid in the occupied West Bank, officials on the two sides said Sunday. 
The Israeli army said it carried out operations and used live fire in several locations, including in Nablus, adding it arrested four “individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activities”. 
The military said “hits” were identified against multiple “terrorists” and said there were no reported wounded on its own side. 
The Palestinian health ministry identified the dead as Muhamad Azizi, 25, who it said was killed by a bullet to the chest, and Abdul Rahman Jamal Suleiman Sobh, 28, who was shot in the head. 
The Palestinian Red Crescent reported treating 19 wounded in Nablus, including 10 people hit by live fire. 
Israel’s security forces have launched near-daily operations in the West Bank following a spate of attacks in Israel in recent months. The Jewish state has occupied the West Bank since 1967. 
Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said those targeted in the overnight raid were linked to recent “shooting attacks” on Israelis, and he commended the security forces for an “efficient and successful operation.” “Several terrorists were killed in the exchanges of fire and several more were wounded. Considerable weaponry was seized,” Lapid said. 
Nabil Abu Rudeina, a spokesman for Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, called the raid an “Israeli crime”. “The entire region will remain in a cycle of violence until the occupation is ended and a just peace is achieved,” he added in a statement to Voice of Palestine radio. 
The Israeli army said in a statement that its operation in Nablus was carried out alongside police, and that it also launched operations in several other locations, including the town of Mughayir, Ayda camp and the city of Jenin. It said the operation in Nablus was launched “to apprehend armed terrorist suspects”. 
“An exchange of fire took place between the armed suspects and Israeli forces. Hits on a number of terrorists were identified,” it said. 
The Israeli military alleged that a “violent riot was instigated” during the “operational activity”. 
“The rioters hurled explosive devices and rocks and shot at... soldiers, endangering their lives,” it said. “The soldiers responded with riot dispersal means and live fire.” The military also said it had operated alongside Israel Border Police in the village of Qabatiya to “apprehend two... suspected of involvement in terrorist activities”. 
“Armed suspects shot at the soldiers, who responded with live fire,” it added. 
At least 52 Palestinians have been killed since late March, mostly in the West Bank, including Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American dual national, who was covering an Israeli raid in Jenin. Over the same period, 19 people have been killed.

2,Two killed in attack on Syria church gathering,"Attack came during a ceremony to inaugurate the Ayia Sofia church, reports media.","DAMASCUS: Two people were killed and 12 injured on Sunday by bombardment of a church as it was being inaugurated in Syria’s central province of Hama, the official SANA news agency reported. 
“A rocket fired by terrorist organisations targeted a religious gathering in the town of Al-Suqaylabiyah near Hama, killing two people and wounding 12,” it said. SANA said the attack came during a ceremony to inaugurate the Ayia Sofia church. 
Britain-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has a vast network of sources on the ground, confirmed the attack. 
Giving a toll of one civilian killed and several wounded, the Observatory said shelling or a drone attack by nearby rebel groups could be to blame. 
Sunday’s attack came two days after bombardment killed seven people, including four children, in the rebel-held Idlib region. 
The Observatory said Friday’s fatalities in the Jisr al-Shughur countryside of northern Syria were caused by Russian air strikes. 
Around half of Idlib province as well as parts of Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces are controlled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the former franchise in Syria of Al Qaeda. 
Other rebel groups in the last pocket of armed opposition to the Damascus regime also remain active, with varying degrees of Turkish backing. 
In March 2020, Russia and Turkey brokered a truce in Idlib and neighbouring areas that still holds, despite sporadic attacks from both sides, including Russian air strikes. 
Syria’s war began in 2011 and has killed nearly half a million people and forced around half of the country’s pre-war population from their homes.

3,Ukraine works to resume grain exports despite strike on port,"Russia claims its missiles hit warship, weapons store in Ukraine's Odesa city.","KYIV: Ukraine pressed ahead on Sunday with efforts to restart grain exports from its Black Sea ports under a deal aimed at easing global food shortages, but warned deliveries would suffer if Russia’s strike on Odesa was a sign of more to come. 
President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced Saturday’s attack as “barbarism” that showed Moscow could not be trusted to implement a deal struck just one day earlier with Turkish and United Nations mediation. 
Public broadcaster Suspilne quoted the Ukrainian military as saying after the strike that the missiles did not hit the port’s grain storage area or cause significant damage and Kyiv said preparations to resume grain shipments were ongoing. 
“We continue technical preparations for the launch of exports of agricultural products from our ports,” Infrastructure Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said in a Facebook post on Saturday. 
Russia said on Sunday its forces had hit a Ukrainian warship and a weapons store in Odesa with missiles. 

Russia claims its missiles hit warship, weapons store in Odesa

The deal signed by Moscow and Kyiv on Friday was hailed as a diplomatic breakthrough that would help curb soaring global food prices, with UN officials saying it could restore Ukrainian grain shipments to pre-war levels of 5 million tonnes a month. 
But Zelensky’s economic advisor warned on Sunday the strike on Odesa signalled that could be out of reach. “Yesterday’s strike indicates that it will definitely not work like that,” Oleh Ustenko told Ukranian television. 
He said Ukraine did have the capacity to export 60 million tonnes of grain over the next nine months, but it would take up to 24 months if its ports could not function properly. 
As the war entered its sixth month on Sunday there was no sign of a let-up in the fighting. The Ukrainian military reported Russian shelling in the north, south and east, and again referred to Russian operations paving the way for an assault on Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region. 
Intensified Russian shelling prompted the mayor of Kharkiv to urge residents of Ukraine’s second-largest city to avoid, if possible, ground transportation. 
“The last week has shown that the aggressor doesn’t even pretend to be firing at military targets anymore,” Ihor Terekhov wrote on Telegram on Sunday. “Use the metro system more often, as of today it is the safest way to get around.” 
Ukraine’s air force command said its forces had shot down early on Sunday three Russian Kalibr cruise missiles fired from the Black Sea and aimed at the western Khmelnytsky region. 
While the main theatre of combat has been the Donbas, Zelensky said in video on Saturday that Ukrainian forces were moving “step by step” into the occupied eastern Black Sea region of Kherson. 
The strikes on Odesa drew condemnation from the United Nations, the European Union, the United States, Britain, Germany and Italy. 
Russian news agencies quoted Russia’s defence ministry as saying that an Ukrainian warship and US supplied anti-ship missiles were destroyed. 
“A docked Ukrainian warship and a warehouse with US-supplied Harpoon anti-ship missiles were destroyed by long-range precision-guided naval missiles in Odesa seaport on the territory of a ship repair plant,” it said. 
On Saturday, Turkey’s defence minister said Russian officials told Ankara that Moscow had “nothing to do” with the strikes. 
According to the Ukrainian military, two Kalibr missiles fired from Russian warships hit the area of a pumping station at the port and two others were shot down by air defence forces. 
Safe passage 
The strikes appeared to violate Friday’s deal, which would allow safe passage in and out of Ukrainian ports. Ukraine and Russia are leading global wheat exporters and a blockade of Ukrainian ports by Russia’s Black Sea fleet since Moscow’s Feb 24 invasion has trapped tens of millions of tonnes of grain, worsening global supply chain bottlenecks.

5,China launches second of three space station modules,"Un-crewed craft, named Wentian, was propelled by a Long March 5B rocket from the Wenchang launch centre.","BEIJING: China on Sunday launched the second of three modules needed to complete its new space station, state media reported, the latest step in Beijing’s ambitious space programme. 
The un-crewed craft, named Wentian, was propelled by a Long March 5B rocket at 2:22pm (0622 GMT) from the Wenchang launch centre on China’s tropical island of Hainan. 
A quarter of an hour later, an official from the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) confirmed the “success” of the launch. 
Hundreds of people gathered on nearby beaches to take photos of the launcher rising through the air in a plume of white smoke. After around eight minutes of flight, “the Wentian lab module successfully separated from the rocket and entered its intended orbit, making the launch a complete success,” the CMSA said. 
Beijing launched the central module of its space station Tiangong — which means “heavenly palace” — in April 2021. 
Almost 18-metre long and weighing 22 tonnes, the new module has three sleeping areas and space for scientific experiments. 
It will dock with the existing module in space, a challenging operation that experts said will require several high-precision manipulations and the use of a robotic arm.
“This is the first time China has docked such large vehicles together, which is a delicate operation,” said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. 
He said until the next module arrives, the space station will have a “rather unusual L-shape” which will take a lot of power to keep stable. 
“These are all technical challenges that the USSR pioneered with the Mir station in the late 1980s, but it’s new to China,” he said. “But it will result in a much more capable station with the space and power to carry out more scientific experiments.” 
Wentian will also serve as a backup platform to control the space station in the event of a failure. The third and final module is scheduled to dock in October, and Tiangong — which should have a lifespan of at least 10 years — is expected to become fully operational by the end of the year. 
Fast-paced space plan 
Under Chinese President Xi Jinping, the country’s plans for its heavily promoted “space dream” have been put into overdrive. China has made large strides in catching up with the United States and Russia, where astronauts and cosmonauts have decades of experience in space exploration. 
“The CSS (Chinese Space Station) will complete its construction... in one and half a year which will be the fastest in history for any modular space station,” said Chen Lan, analyst for the site Go-Taikonauts.com, which specialises in China’s space programme. “In comparison, the constructions of Mir and the International Space Station took 10 and 12 years, respectively.” 
China’s space programme has already landed a rover on Mars and sent probes to the Moon. In addition to a space station, Beijing is also planning to build a base on the Moon and send humans there by 2030. 
China has been excluded from the International Space Station since 2011, when the United States banned NASA from engaging with the country. 
While China does not plan to use its space station for global cooperation on the scale of the ISS, Beijing has said it is open to foreign collaboration.
