Rescue 1122 media coordinator Aizaz Mehmood said that people trapped in the areas affected by rain and flood in Parwa and Paharpur tehsils were being evacuated through boats.
He said that women and children were shifted to safer places through boats in Chandna while the rescue operation was under way in Paharpur tehsil.

On the other hand, the communication and electricity system in Dera city and its suburbs has been disrupted due to heavy rain and flood. Due to the poor drainage system in Dera city, rain water accumulated in the markets and streets.
People faced severe problems and suffered huge losses as water entered their houses and shops. They demanded of the administration to declare emergency in the affected areas.
In Lower Dir, a boy identified as Fawad, son of Salehur Rehman, was killed when roof of his house collapsed due to heavy rain in Zaim Asbanr area in Adenzai.
It began to rain heavily in parts of the district early on Sunday due to which several link roads in the hilly areas were blocked. The main Timergara-Peshawar road remained blocked for several hours due to flood in the Talash stream.
Flash flood triggered by the monsoon rains in the far off Kandia tehsil of Upper Kohistan destroyed houses and standing crops in the area.
“The continuous rain and flash flood have destroyed many houses and standing crops. The small hydropower generators installed on streams to supply electricity to local communities have been swept away,” Abdul Hafeez, a resident of the area, told reporters on Sunday.
The rain, which started some three days ago, has still been lashing Hazara division. The rain caused land and mudslides that blocked roads and inundated houses in remote parts of Hazara division.
Kandia valley was affected badly by continuous rain and landslides as many houses were inundated but no loss of life was reported anywhere in the entire tehsil.
“Thanks to Allah there is no loss of life anywhere in the entire tehsil but people have suffered financial losses as their houses have been destroyed and roads leading to rest of Kohistan have been blocked because of the land and mudslides,” said Mr Hafeez.
He said that Kandia tehsil, having a scattered population, was prone to natural calamities as monsoon rains always caused losses to locals. “The district administration should launch rescue and relief activities in the tehsil so that the affected people could be shifted to other areas,” he added.
The link roads in Dubair and Ranowalia in Lower Kohistan were also blocked to traffic following landslides. “If the blocked roads are not reopened timely, the affected areas could be faced with shortage of food items,” said Mohammad Hussain, another local.
In Lakki Marwat, five persons including two women were wounded in roof collapse incidents due to heavy downpour.
An official said that roof of a house collapsed in Kotka Zafran village of Naurang town, causing injuries to four people including two women and two children. He said that a rescue team rushed to the locality, retrieved the wounded people from the debris and shifted them to tehsil headquarters hospital.

3,Govt to introduce inclusive education in two special schools,PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has planned to introduce inclusive education in two schools of special...,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has planned to introduce inclusive education in two schools of special education on pilot basis to enable the children to start a normal life.
“We have given a proposal to the social welfare department to upgrade facilities in two of the 11 special education schools to enhance the mobility of physically challenged children,” said Dr Mahboobur Rahman, a former head of physiotherapy department at Hayatabad Medical Complex.
Speaking at a free medical camp at Habib Physiotherapy Complex Hayatabad on Sunday, he said that number of special children was rising due to economic hardships, burgeoning poverty, surge in population in addition to war against terrorism in former tribal areas.
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), Pakistan has 15 per cent population with disabilities, including 80 per cent physical disabilities, and the rest suffer from mental and other forms, which need assistive devices, psychological assistance and speech and hearing therapies to make them useful citizens of the society.
Dr Rahman appreciated the provincial government for launching physiotherapy services in district headquarters hospitals in 2015. About 100 physiotherapists are now working throughout the province. He said that government started providing assistive devices, such as artificial limbs on Sehat Card Plus that would help the people with disabilities as most of them belonged to poor families.
During the daylong medical camps, more than 100 patients were examined. They were also given assistive devices, including wheelchairs.
Dr Hafiz Yasin, on the occasion, said that physiotherapy could help children with autism, cerebral palsy and polio victims to become normal people. He also suggested that special children should be allowed to study in general schools along with normal students in the same classrooms.
He said that inclusive schools were needed to enable the special to hold pen, change clothes, wear socks and shoes and attend bathrooms. He said that inclusive education gained worldwide currency where people with disabilities were training on how to drive vehicles through modification to ensure their accessibility through changing patterns and alternation.
Dr Said Khaliq said that inclusive education could play an important role in training of the people suffering from cerebral palsy and autism besides slow learners and mild physically challenged children.
Free corrective services provided by trained physiotherapists to polio victims benefit victims and majority of the polio-related deformities can be avoided through prompt medical checkup.

5,Month-long Covid vaccination drive begins today in KP as cases increase,Govt extends health emergency for three months.,"PESHAWAR: The health department is launching a month-long special Covid-19 vaccination campaign to scale up immunity of people as cases have been on the rise for the last one week.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has the lowest Covid-19 vaccination rate among all the provinces. National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) has asked the province to achieve at least 80 per cent vaccination target.
On Sunday, the province recorded 81 coronavirus cases and one death, making the total incidences 220,946 and fatalities 6,329 since onset of the pandemic, according to a health department report.
A 100-year-old person succumbed to the virus in Abbottabad, as the government extended health emergency for another three months to be able to cope with the situation in case of further increase in the number of patients.
Officials said that extension of emergency was important to stay prepared and procure medicines, masks and kits. 

Govt extends health emergency for three months

“Though procurement is conducted through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Procurement Authority’s rules and open bidding, we never know when cases increase to the extent to exhaust routine supply chain and we have to buy vital items through quotation,” they added.
They said that the province was launching 30-day special Covid-19 vaccination campaign that would continue July 25 to August 25.
In this regard, a detailed meeting with all the district health officers (DHOs) has already taken place on Monday last, followed by a meeting chaired by Chief Secretary Dr Shahzad Khan Bangash in which campaign timelines and modalities were discussed.
Officials said that it would be a four weeks campaign, six days a week, wherein targets were fixed for districts based on NCOC data. They said that data of NCOC was based on census 2017.
“Our full vaccination as a province is 61 per cent, the lowest among all federating units, hence the aim is to fully vaccinate 80 per cent population as assigned by NCOC,” said officials.
The DHOs have also been directed to prepare their micro plans for achieving the targets and focus on major priority areas, including public gatherings like Nadra and passport offices, district administration complexes, railway stations, medical teaching institutions (MTIs), basic health units (BHUs), rural health centres (RHCs) and district headquarters hospitals (DHQs).
The BHUs, RHCs and DHQs have been instructed to hold outreach sessions in their catchment areas and cover the people in markets, bus stands, Muharram processions, checkposts, motorways tuck shops and bus rapid transit stations. Outreach activities remain the only tool to successfully achieve the target.
“On directives of chief secretary, a detailed presentation is also being shared for the potential areas and ways to achieve the target as per NCOC’s guidelines,” said officials.
They said that DHOs were ordered to increase vaccinator logins to increase daily entries and help piling of backlogs on National Immunisation Management System (Nims).
Officials said that in view of upswing in infection, it was decided that daily situation reports of Covid-19 would be generated thrice a day, including 12 noon, 6pm and 10pm. “The night report will be shared with high-ups indicating performance ranking of the districts,” they added.
Districts have also been asked to increase testing and collect samples from at least 10 to 15 persons from the close contacts of the confirmed patients. “During the last 24 hours, only 1,680 samples were tested. It is not enough and we need at least 7,000 tests per day to know the exact prevalence of the virus in the province,” said officials.

PESHAWAR: The first book of young Pashto writer Iman Hussain Kainat has attracted the attention of a wide range of literati and readers.
Published recently, the book titled ‘Lambay Pa Ayeena Kay’ (flames in the mirror) contains ghazals, poems and songs. However, the major portion of the book is consisted of ghazals.
Renowned artist Riffat Khattak has made the title of book while preface and comments on the book have been penned down by famous poet and former director of Radio Pakistan Laiqzada Laiq, reputed playwright and poet Nurual Bashar Naveed and Iman Hussain Kainat herself.
Being a mentor of the author, Nurul Bashar Naveed writes about her that she is one of those veiled Pashto women writers, who spend all their lives within the four walls of their houses.
However, her imagination is so strong and fertile that she can create a vast world for herself and her readers by using attractive similes, meaningful metaphors and appealing idioms in her poetry.
Being a keen observer, Iman Hussain Kainat has deeply studied the world scenario, situation of the region and condition of the people in the Pakhtun society. Nationalism, humanity, romance and Pakhtun culture are main topics of her poetry.
She has depicted the agonies, sufferings, happiness, dreams and sentiments of Pakhtuns, especially women, in her poetry. However, she is not prejudiced to ignore sufferings of humanity at the hand of usurpers in other parts of the world.
The readers will wonder to see the sublime thought and mature rendition of her fine sentiments in Kainat’s poetry and they might suspect that it is not her first poetry book. Her natural talent has gifted her maturity of thought and grip on different literary genres, which are usually gained by interaction with seniors writers and regular participation in literary sessions and gatherings.
Due to her powerful imagination, she never feels lonely despite being limited to the four walls of her house. Life for her is a continuous journey of struggle and she invites the whole universe to accompany her in this journey without losing her identity.

(I continue to walk and your memories chase me
What melodious voices chase me?
I am not alone as my dreams accompany me
See they queue to chase me)
Besides glorifying the features of Pakhtun code of life, Kainat also uses symbols in her poetry to depict various shades of life and society.

He was visiting the Buddhist sites along with his 20 disciples and other people from Thailand. On the first day, the members of the delegation visited Swat Museum, Saidu Sharif Stupa and Butkara Buddhist Monastery where the monk worshipped.
Monk Arayawangso said that it was his first visit to Swat. He said that he had studied a lot about Uddiyana, the ancient name of Swat, and its rich and diverse history.
“I am happy to see the Buddhist sites and hundreds of artefacts in Swat Museum. I wish Buddhists from the 32 countries of the world visit Swat and see the ancient monasteries and other sites,” he said.
Dr Nitinant Wisaweisuan, the dean of Puey Ungphakorn School of Development Studies, Thammasat University, a member of the delegation told Dawn that she was impressed with the scenic beauty of Swat and its diverse cultural heritage and history including Buddhism.

14,PHC bench refers petitions against sales tax in ex-Fata to chief justice,Observes larger bench should thoroughly examine the issue...,"PESHAWAR: A two-member Peshawar High Court bench has requested the chief justice to constitute a larger bench for thoroughly examining the issue raised in around 30 petitions, challenging non-exemption of steel and ghee or cooking oil industries in erstwhile tribal areas from imposition of sales tax on electricity consumption.
The bench consisting of Justice Syed M Attique Shah and Justice Syed Arshad Ali decided to refer the matter to the PHC chief justice as it differed with an earlier judgment of the court on the same issue wherein it was held that the court had no jurisdiction to declare the relevant provision of the law ultra vires.
Through almost identical petitions the petitioners, which are registered companies in erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas and Provincially Administered Tribal Areas, had challenged Entry No 152 in the 6th schedule of the Sales Tax Act, 1990, to the extent of excluding the grant of exemption in the sales tax on the consumption of electricity to steel and ghee/cooking oil industries.
An additional attorney general, Amir Javed, presented an earlier judgment of the high court wherein a similar relief was asked by the petitioners, however, the court had declined to grant the relief on the ground that a constitutional court had no jurisdiction to declare the law ultra vires to the Constitution.

Observes larger bench should thoroughly examine the issue

While differing with the earlier judgment, the bench quoted different judgments of the Supreme Court observing that the apex court had held that if any legislation, which offended any provision of the Constitution, would be ultra vires.
The bench observed that keeping in view the law, laid down by the Supreme Court, the petitions might be placed before the chief justice for constitution of larger bench so that the issue was thoroughly examined.
Several lawyers including Isaac Ali Qazi, Mufariq Shah, Sajeed Afridi, etc appeared for the petitioners and stated that before merger of Fata and Pata into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through the Constitution (Twenty-Fifth) Amendment Act, 2018, the inhabitants of those areas were enjoying immunity from different taxes including sales tax.
They stated that the industrial units of Fata and Pata were enjoying immunity from the Sales Tax Act, 1990 because of its non-extension to those areas in view of Article 247 (3) of the Constitution.
They stated that the prime minister had made commitment at the time of passage of the Constitution (Twenty Fifth Amendment) Act that existing immunity/exemption of taxes would continue for another 10 years.
Isaac Ali Qazi pointed out that the federal government through the Finance Act, 2019, inserted entries No 151, 152 and 153 in the sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990.
He stated that through Entry No 151, the immunity/exemption was reiterated with procedure about how to avail that exemption.
However, he added under Entry 152, exemption of sales tax on electricity bills was granted to all industries except steel mills and ghee or cooking oil units of erstwhile tribal areas. Previously, he stated through an SRO NO 1212 issued on October 5, 2018, the exemption from sales tax on electricity boils was available for time bound up to Jun 30, 2023.
He argued that it was discriminatory on part of government to not include the steel and ghee or cooking oil industries in the exemption/immunity from sales tax on electricity bills.
The petitioners have requested the court to declare as discriminatory the respondents including the federal government, Federal Board of Revenue and others attempt to charge sales tax in any form on supply of electricity to the petitioners.
They also prayed that the exclusion clause in the Entry No 152 of the Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, may be declared as ultra vires to the constitution.
