• Leadership of ruling alliance to address presser before appearance
LAHORE: Top leaders from the ruling alliance on Sunday decided to appear along with their lawyers before the Chief Justice of Pakistan-led bench of the Supreme Court, seized with the case related to the Punjab chief minister’s election, when the apex court resumes hearing on Monday.
The leaders of the ruling coalition also decided to formally file a petition with SC registrar’s office seeking for­mation of a full court bench for hearing of all related petitions, including the Supreme Court Bar Association’s (SCBA) petition seeking review of the SC’s earlier opinion on Arti­cle 63-A. They will address a presser in the morning before appearing in court with the same request, according to a statement by federal Infor­mation Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb. 
A source privy to the development said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, former president Asif Ali Zardari or Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and leaders of other coalition partners would be part of the leadership that will appear before Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial-led three-member bench.
The statement said the PPP, PML-N and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl would appear before the SC bench, while the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), Balochistan National Party (BNP), Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) and other allied parties would also be among the petitioners. “These are very important national, political and constitutional matters and the national economy is facing bankruptcy and the masses unemployment and poverty due to the political instability caused by them,” it explained.
The issue emerged when Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker Dost Mohammad Mazari on July 22 declared that votes of the PML-Q lawmakers in the runoff poll for the office of chief minister could not be counted as they were cast in violation of their party head Chaudhry Shujaat’s directions.
Mr Mazari said he based his decision on the recent Supreme Court judgement on the April 16th CM’s election in which 25 Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPAs had voted for PML-N leader Hamza Shehbaz against the PTI chief Imran Khan’s written directions. The SC had ruled the 25 votes could not be counted, while the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on the basis of the court verdict later de-seated all those lawmakers who went against their PTI chief’s directions.
Parvez Elahi, who was declared unsuccessful in the race for Punjab’s top slot, challenged the deputy speaker’s ruling before the SC’s Lahore registry in the early hours of Saturday. It was immediately fixed for Saturday afternoon and CJP Umar Ata Bandial during the hearing remarked that prima facie the deputy speaker’s ruling was against the SC decision on the Article 63-A reference. The court then made Hamza a “trustee” chief minister until Monday noon, directing him not to take any major official decision that could politically benefit him.
Since the Saturday’s hearing, the PML-N has publicly begun questioning the “partiality” of a particular bench of the SC and is pressing on constitution of a full court bench for a verdict ‘acceptable to all’.
In reference to apparently two different approaches of the SC on the defection issue, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar said there could be “no two laws on a similar issue”. He told a presser on Sunday that the issue would be resolved for good if full court bench heard the case.
About possible ouster of Hamza from power by the apex court, the law minister said that if a public representative was to be sent home by a court, then “justice, transparency and independence” demanded a full court bench hear the matter. “There is no solution to the issue other than a full court bench.”

1,Six killed as ‘abnormal’ rains refuse to relent,"Dozens of villages in Balochistan flooded, Hub Dam filled to brim; KP villages remain submerged.","• Holiday declared in Karachi, Hyderabad divisions; port city records up to 142mm rain
• Dozens of villages in Balochistan flooded; Hub Dam filled to brim
• KP villages remain submerged
• Landslide, flooding in Gilgit
ISLAMABAD: Citizens across the country endured another spell of “abnormal” monsoon rains on Sunday as heavy downpour claimed six lives — three in Karachi — and caused urban flooding in major cities and flash floods in mountainous regions, putting several villages at risk of inundation. 
In order to mitigate the impact of the downpour, the Sindh chief minister declared the latest spell a “natural calamity” and announced a holiday in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions on Monday (today) in order to “meet the emergency-like situation” stemming from excessive rainfall in the province, especially in the provincial capital. 
Still reeling from the previous spell that had brought life to a standstill in the city, Karachi received a record deluge — up to 142 millimetres — that resulted in the death of three people, due to electrocution, and urban flooding in neighbourhoods across the provincial city.

In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, two people — one each in Dera Ismail Khan and Lower Dir — were killed and 10 injured as a result of a heavy downpour that resulted in floods whereas a boy was killed in Lahore in a rain-related incident. 
As residents from remote parts pointed out the apathy of government officials, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to assist the provincial governments and the departments concerned, PM’s Office media wing said in a press release.  The prime minister urged the elected representatives to “supervise the rescue and relief activities launched by the relevant departments”, said a statement. 
Sindh 
In Sindh, Karachi fared worst as rain lashed the city throughout the evening turning its streets and major arteries into canals. 
Many underpasses in Karachi remained submerged and closed for vehicular traffic, while Karachi University and the Board of Intermediate Education Karachi also cancelled exams scheduled for Monday (today) in light of the rain forecast. 
Similarly, a breach in Hub Canal caused panic in Surjani Town and Manghopir localities. 
In Hyderabad, heavy downpour brought most parts of the city to a halt. The rain started in the wee hours of Sunday and continued till 7:30 pm intermittently. The Met department predicted more rain as dark clouds covered the city sky. 
A second spell of the rain which lasted for over an hour proved disastrous as it brought life to a standstill and forced markets to suspend operations due to urban flooding. “Our entire market was closed after heavy rain started around 4 pm on Sunday”, said Mohammad Fahim, a cloth merchant said. 
In Mirpur Khas and Benazirabad, after a night-long spell, the rainwater damaged roads and entered houses. Additionally, Dadu was facing a “flood-like situation” Kheer Thar mountain range received heavy downpour that filled small dams in the region to the brim. 
Dozens of villages in union councils Haji Khan, Sawro, Drigh Bala, Wahi Pandhi, Chhinni, and Tando Rahim Yar Khan were flooded whereas at least 24 houses collapsed in Chhni and Shah Hasan union councils. More than 200 villages have been completely cut off from the headquarters Johi, Dadu district. 
Due to continuous rains in the mountainous area of Jamshoro and Thana Bola Khan, the land route of the residents of more than 70 rural areas of five union councils was also cut off. 
Balochistan 
In Balochistan, the authorities issued a high alert after heavy rain in catchment areas of the Hub Dam. 
“Heavy flash floods are approaching the dam after the catchment areas of Hub Dam, including Sarona, Dureji, Winder, Bala and other areas received heavy rains for the last 16 hours,” Lasbela Deputy Commissioner Iftikhar Bugti told Dawn. 
“We have issued a high alert to the population of nearby villages to immediately shift to safer places as flash floods would reach the dam in the next few hours,” he said on Sunday evening while speaking to Dawn. According to the deputy commissioner, the floods could put over a dozen villages at risk. “We are helping the families to shift to safer places,” Mr Bugti said. 
Meanwhile, about 300 pilgrims, including women and children, were stranded at Shah Noorani Shrine after a bridge on the Viraab River was washed away in a flash flood. Officials said the Pakistan Navy was helping the local administration to rescue the pilgrims. 
The flooding also affected pillars of the Hub Dam protection wall prompting the National Highway Authority (NHA) to close the bridge for traffic between Hub and Karachi. 
Heavy rains were also reported in Loralai, Ziarat, Harnai, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, and many towns and cities of central Balochistan. 
Punjab 
Several districts in south Punjab and some in central parts of the province were pounded by rain which killed one boy and injured two more: the boy died after lightning struck him in Jhang while two people were injured in a roof collapse in Faisalabad. 
A breach in a canal flooded several villages and farmland in Bahawalnagar whereas rain over the Koh-e-Suleman mountain range caused damage to 14 villages in Rajanpur and Dera Ghazi Khan. 
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
Parts of KP remained submerged throughout as rain-induced floods destroyed houses and infrastructure in Dera Ismail Khan, Chitral, and Kohistan region. According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, almost 200 to 250 houses were affected by floods in Chandana, Jathan Wala and Tilkan villages of Dera Ismail Khan. 
In Lower Chitral, a flash flood was reported in Shishikoh, Gobore, Danin, and Bamborate valleys while Upper Chitral Booni and Terich areas also reported flooding. 
In Kohistan, Karakorum Highway at Uchar has been blocked for all types of traffic as floods washed away infrastructure in various villages of tehsil Kandia. 
Gilgit 
Flash floods also wreak havoc in Gilgit-Baltistan as houses, roads, agricultural land, standing crops, trees, irrigation channels, infrastructures, and power grid suffered losses across the region. 
As a result of the downpour, a flooded nullah damaged property in Sherqila village. This is the second flood in this village during the current month. Floods destroyed electricity and water supply facilities in the area and left dozens of families homeless. 
Flash floods created disasters in Bagrote, Bulchi, Sultanabad, Jutial, Nomal and other areas of the Gilgit district in addition to the Hamochal village of Punial. 
A road connecting Ghizer and Gilgit was blocked after a landslide whereas the Karakoram Highway was also blocked in the Sultanabad area, spelling hardships for locals and tourists alike.

2,37-member Punjab cabinet sworn in,"PTI, PML-Q term oath-taking violation of court orders as Hamza not an ""elected"" CM.","LAHORE: A 37-member cabinet of Punjab’s “trustee” Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz took oath of their offices here on Sunday evening, provoking the ire of the opposition PTI and PML-Q which termed it a violation of the court orders. 
The oath-taking ceremony was held at the Governor House around 16 hours before the Supreme Court is to take up on Monday the case related to the controversial runoff poll for the office of chief minister conducted on Friday. 
The decision to immediately form the provincial cabinet was taken at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif earlier in the day. 
Punjab Governor Bali­ghur Rehman administered oath to the cabinet members. They included ex-speaker Rana Muhammad Iqbal, Mehr Iqbal Achlana, ex-food minister Malik Nadeem Kamran, Bilal Yasin, ex-education minister Rana Mashhood, ex-health minister Khwaja Imran Nazir, Yawar Zaman, Manshaallah Butt, ex-agriculture minister Ahmed Ali Aulakh, Saba Sadiq, Malik Asad Khokhar, Saiful Malook Khokhar, Rana Liaquat, Bilal Asghar Warraich, Syed Hassan Murtaza, and Haider Ali Gilani. 
Retired Col Ayub Gadhi, Kazim Ali Pirzada, Chaudhry Shafiq, Iqbal Gujjar, Fida Hussain Wattoo, Rana Ijaz Noon, Azma Zahid Bukhari, Khalil Tahir Sindhu, Sania Ashiq, Sibtain Bukhari, Jehangir Khanzada, retired Col Rana Tariq, Qasim Hanjra, Zaheer Iqbal Channar, Zeeshan Rafiq, Qasim Abbas Langa, Ashraf Ansari, Chaudhry Shafiq, Tanveer Aslam Malik, Siddiq Khan Baloch, and Imran Khalid Butt are other members of the cabinet. 
PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry says the oath taking of the cabinet is against the Supreme Court orders because Hamza is not an “elected” chief minister.
“They are making fun of the court orders. They are acting like the Sicilian mafia, which is a matter of concern,” he told media in Islamabad.
Parvez Elahi, who had contested against Hamza Shehbaz for the office of chief minister on Friday, criticised the formation of the Punjab cabinet, saying it was an open violation of the apex court’s orders passed during Saturday’s hearing on his petition challenging results of the runoff poll. 
He said oath of the Punjab cabinet was no less than a joke and added that the Trustee Chief Minister was making a mockery of the Supreme Court order by doling out ministries. 
Mr Elahi said the swearing-in of the large Punjab cabinet would not be able to save the rulers. The court had appointed Hamza as “trustee” chief minister barring him from making any major decision that could benefit him politically, said Mr Elahi, adding the step warranted contempt of court proceedings against Mr Hamza.

3,PbBC leader’s murder: Police focus on ‘fake’ lawyers scam,Punjab Bar Council secretary was sprayed with bullets on his way back home late on Saturday night.,"LAHORE: Police investigating the murder of Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) secretary who was sprayed with bullets on his way back home late on Saturday night have found strong possibilities that the ‘targeted killing’ is linked to his struggle to expose ‘fake lawyers’ by pursuing legal action against them.
As the assassination of 50-year-old lawyer, Mohammad Ashraf Rahi, in Lahore months after the killing of Sindh Bar Council Secretary Irfan Ali Mehr in Karachi sent a wave of resentment among the legal fraternity, the Punjab chief minister on Sunday ordered early arrest of the attackers and sought a report from Lahore police chief. Initial investigations showed that over 100 fake degree cases of lawyers had been exposed and Mr Rahi was pursuing legal course of action against them, the Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) told Dawn on Sunday.
“We are shifting our all focus towards the fake degree scam, as Ashraf Rahi had received serious life threats for leading criminal proceedings against the fraudsters [in legal fraternity],” he said.
DIG Investigations Kamran Adil had been assigned the responsibility of supervising the investigations into the murder case, he said, adding that a police team spent hours in Punjab Safe City Authority office to closely examine the footage of cameras installed in and around the crime scene to identify the two attackers who sped away on a motorbike and trace their movement.
He said the police investigators were hopeful to trace the suspects.
Declaring it a high-profile murder case, other officials said there were strong possibilities that the gun attack had been carried out due to the senior lawyer’s active involvement in leading legal proceedings and actions against the ‘fake’ members of the community.
While requesting anonymity, a police official told Dawn the police held meetings with close relatives of the deceased and some senior representatives and office-bearers of the lawyers’ associations.
The information gleaned during the course of investigation unveiled that Mr Rahi enjoyed good repute not only among his relatives but also in the legal fraternity, the official said. “Though we also found out a domestic issue of the deceased, it was not of serious nature that needs to be investigated by the police,” he said.
After discussing all the factors at a meeting, senior police officers were unanimous on the point that the PBC secretary’s murder be investigated keeping in view the perspective of fake LLB degree cases.
In 2020, he said, the PBC had sent 230 LLB degrees to Punjab University for verification. Of them, the PBC cancelled licences of some lawyers in the light of the report of the PU department of examinations when it declared the degrees ‘bogus’.
Sharing details of the gun attack, he said the senior lawyer was gunned down in Lahore’s Badami Bagh area. Two armed motorcyclists ambushed his car when he was going back home from his office, located at the Fan Road, and sprayed him with a volley of bullets. Mr Rahi died on the spot.
Earlier in December 2021, Sindh Bar Council Secretary Irfan Ali Mehr was also murdered in a gun attack near his house in the Gulistan-i-Jauhar area of Karachi. 
Taking notice of the murder, Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz sought a report from the CCPO and ordered him to ensure early arrest of the attackers. Expressing his heartfelt sympathy and sorrow with the family members of the slain lawyer, the chief minister assured them of provision of justice at the earliest.

4,Govt set to lift import ban on luxury items,"Set to provide subsidised gas, power to export sectors; restrictions on cellphone, automobile import to stay, say sources.","• Restrictions on cellphone, automobile import to remain in place
• Set to provide subsidised gas, power to export sectors
ISLAMABAD: The government is set to begin removing restrictions on the import of “non-essential and luxury items” imposed on May 19 and provide energy at subsidised rates — electricity at nine cents per unit and gas at $9 per unit — throughout the current fiscal year to make the country’s exports competitive.
Sources told Dawn that a special virtual meeting of the Economic Coordination Commi­ttee (ECC) had been scheduled for Sunday to approve the subsidised energy rates, but was then postponed at the last moment for a day to be merged with another huddle on Monday with important items on the table.
The sources said the government expected about $3 billion inflows from “some friends” during the current week and wanted to give a “confidence and feel-good sense to the market” by supporting five export-oriented sectors and simultaneously clearing import payables and gradually easing restrictions on most imports (except mobile phones and automobiles) imposed on about 85 items for a temporary period.
In consultation with energy and finance ministries and the export sectors, the commerce ministry has sought the supply of electricity at a final, all-inclusive rate of nine cents per unit (kilowatt-hour, or kWh) to five export-oriented sectors — jute, leather, carpet, surgical and sports goods — from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023.
Secondly, the imported and regasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) would be provided to these sectors at an all-inclusive rate of $9 per unit (million British thermal units, or mmBtu) instead of $6.5 at present. The rate will be applicable across Pakistan without any disparity.
As such, RLNG would be provided to consumers of Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGCL) on the same concessionary tariff as that for Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) consumers of five export sectors.
At present, there is a restriction on new industrial connections due to a shortage of natural gas. The government has already allocated Rs60bn for these subsidised rates — Rs20bn for electricity and Rs40bn for RLNG — in the federal budget for 2022-23 to supply energy at concessionary tariff to these sectors.
The finance ministry would give a financial commitment that additional funds, if required by power and petroleum divisions because of higher international prices, would be provided to continue the supply of energy to the export sector at unchanged rates.
It has, nevertheless, emphasised that additional subsidy was not permissible under the IMF programme and the energy divisions should seek timely adjustments in rates to stay within the allocations.
At a higher level, it was decided that power and petroleum divisions would be required to alert the finance ministry in advance and move a formal summary for a supplementary grant from the ECC in a timely manner.
The case for fixed energy prices comes before the ECC as a formality for approval following a decision taken in principle by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at a meeting attended by ministers for finance, commerce, power, petroleum and representatives of the textile industry.
It has been accepted at the policy level that regionally competitive rates had provided a launching pad to exports, which jumped 26pc year-on-year to $32bn in the previous fiscal year. Therefore, fixed rates for the current year and regionally competitive rates throughout the 2020-25 Textile and Apparel Policy would be ensured to maintain the export momentum.
While reviewing the issues of regionally competitive tariffs and the availability of power, gas and RLNG, the meeting had decided that keeping in view the expensive energy imports, textile sector’s proposals and available budgetary space, “electricity at nine cents per kWh and RLNG at $9 per mmBtu all-inclusive will be provided to export-oriented sectors”.
It was, however, reported that only 50 million cubic feet per day of gas would be supplied to captive power plants of export-oriented sectors on the SNGPL network till the time supply-related issues arising out of tough international markets get settled.
The textile industry agreed that its captive power plants in Punjab using local gas primarily for power generation would be shifted to the national grid.
However, it would be important for the gas and power companies to ensure uninterrupted supply and reliability of grid electricity and sort out issues of new connections, load enhancement and transmission and distribution in the first place.
The ban on the import of mobile phones and automobiles would, however, remain in place for the time being because of their big foreign exchange impact. Most other items had lower foreign exchange costs and larger value addition and employment impact, the sources said.
These sources, however, explained that expensive phones and automobiles already in the import process at the time of the ban had already been given relief last week by allowing their clearance from the port at 5pc surcharge after their arrival within two weeks since May 19 and at 15pc surcharge for items that arrived two weeks after the ban and before June 30.
Relevant statutory regulatory orders (SROs) were issued on July 22 to exempt timber/wood import from the ban and clear shipments arrived at ports, including mostly automobile items with 5pc and 15pc surcharge.
The sources said the ECC would also take up for formal approval and implementation a federal cabinet decision taken in February to amend the Imports and Exports Control Act 1950 to change the words “federal government” with the “minister in charge” to allow one-time permission for import, export or re-export on a case-to-case basis.
The government had imposed a complete ban on the import of 30 categories involving about 85 customs headings, including automobiles, mobile phones, home appliances, fruits and dry fruits (except Afghanistan), crockery, private weapons and ammunition, shoes, chandeliers and lighting (except energy savers), headphones and loudspeakers.
Other heads include sauces, doors and window frames, travel bags and suitcases, sanitary ware, fish and frozen fish, carpets (except Afghanistan), preserved fruits, tissue paper, furniture, shampoos, confectionery, luxury mattresses and sleeping bags, jams and jelly, cornflakes, toiletries, heaters, blowers, sunglasses, kitchenware, aerated water, frozen meat, juices, pasta, ice cream, cigarettes, shaving goods, luxury leather apparel, musical instruments, salon items like hair dryers, etc., and chocolates.
