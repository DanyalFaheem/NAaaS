• Nominal GDP grows to $383bn from $3bn in 1950
• Per capita income to $1,798 from $86
ISLAMABAD: The structure of economy has drastically changed since Pakistan’s inception in 1947 with industry and then services sectors dominated the economy, says a finance ministry report released on Saturday.
The report gives a glimpse of the country’s 75-year economic journey, with all major economic indicators seeing massive changes over the period. 

 





 
At the time of the independence in 1947, Pakistan inherited only 34 industrial units out of the 921 in undivided India.
The nominal GDP rose from $3 billion in 1950 to $383bn in 2022, while GDP growth was recorded at 5.97pc in 2022 compared to 1.8pc in 1950. Per capita income jumped from $86 in 1950 to $1,798 in 2022.
The tax revenues rose from Rs0.31bn to Rs6,126.1bn from 1950-2022, while agriculture accounted for 59.9pc of the total GDP in 1949-50.
In the agriculture sector, the production of wheat increased from 3.35 million tonnes in 1958 to 29.4m tonnes in 2022, rice from 0.69m tonnes to 9.32m tonnes, maize from 0.36m tonnes to 10.64m tonnes, sugarcane from 5.53m tonnes to 88.65m tonnes, cotton from 1.16m bales to 8.33m bales and water availability from 63.9 million acre-feet to 131 MAF.
On the external side, remittances sent by Pakistanis working abroad jumped from $0.14bn in FY73 to $31.2bn in FY22, exports from $162m in FY50 to $31.8bn in FY22, and imports from $276m in FY50 to $80.2bn in FY22.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said the dearth of resources to meet the local needs after independence was not a secret as India refused to give due share of its wealth to Pakistan soon after its birth.
The severely disrupted country’s economic system along with settlement of the refugees were major challenges faced by the newly born country, he said but added that Pakistan’s economy quickly revitalised with the hard work and determination of its people.
He said a country with 30 million population in 1947 could not feed its population and had to import most of its food requirements from abroad, adding that local agriculture production has risen significantly today.
Mr Ismail said Pakistan constructed both large and small dams like Tarbela and Mangla, which increased the water storage and availability to 131 MAF in 2022 from 63.9 MAF in 1965-66, adding that it helped in achieving sustain agriculture sector growth.
He said Pakistan emerged as one of the leading exporters of textiles, pharmaceutical goods and food-related items and economic policies of the successive governments have promoted industry, agriculture and services sectors.
The perseverance of its people made Pakistan the world’s 24th largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity and 44th in terms of nominal GDP, the finance minister said.
Federal Secretary Ministry of Finance Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh said the 75 years journey of Pakistan was a story of economic, political, social and regional events that has shaped the country that we live today.
He said several boom-bust cycles, political crises and geo-strategic challenges have guided the country’s policies and programmes.
He said Pakistan was ranked among 50 leading economies of the world with GDP amounting $383bn, adding that it also established its vibrant banking system that supported economic development over the years.

1,Financial sector sees no change in upcoming monetary policy,"In July, the central bank had raised the interest rate by 125 basis points to 15 per cent.","KARACHI: The prime question in the financial sector is whether there will be any change in the monetary policy, which is scheduled be announced on Aug 22. 
Speaking to Dawn, most financial analysts and bankers said the benchmark interest rate would be maintained at the current level.
On July 7, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) raised the interest rate by 125 basis points to 15 per cent, saying the inflation remain on the higher side this fiscal year. The Consumer Price Index-based inflation surged to 24.9pc in July. 
With this high interest rate, banks are satisfied with the investment in government papers that offer about 16pc returns, but the government is carrying heavy loads of costly borrowing.
Since imports have dropped, which played a key role in increasing the revenue for the government in FY22, they will not yield revenue this year. 
Imports have been officially restricted in order to improve the situation with the twin deficits of trade and current account.
The recent trade numbers show that the country’s trade deficit shrank by 18pc year-on-year and 47pc month-on-month during July FY23, mainly on the back of a decline in imports.
Some financial analysts believe that with the measures taken by the authorities to curb imports, along with a decline in international commodity prices, the current account deficit is likely to remain lower in FY23.
The high policy rate of 15pc is enough to slow the economy, which grew at a rate of about 6pc in FY22. 
With a 15pc interest rate, banks charge their clients between 20pc and 25pc, depending on the risks associated with the loans being extended. Clearly, the outflow of money towards the economy will be reduced and ultimately reduce inflation as long as we have economic growth.
In its report issued on Saturday, Tahir Abbas, head of research at Arif Habib, said, “The rates on EFS (export finance scheme) and LTFF (long term financing) loans were linked to the policy rate, at a 500bps discount though (to 10pc), so as to continue incentivising exports while ensuring monetary tightening penetrates effectively.”
“Together, these steps were taken to ensure a soft landing of the economy at a time when global dynamics remained challenging, while also cooling down economic activity, steering inflation towards expectations and providing support to the rupee in the backdrop of multi-year high imports and record imports,” he said.
In his survey about the expected policy rate on Monday, he found that 68pc of the total respondents are of the view that the SBP will keep the policy rate unchanged at 15pc.
However, 32pc of total respondents anticipate a hike; 16pc anticipate a rate hike of less than 75 bps; 8pc anticipate a rate hike of 100 bps; and 4pc anticipate a rate hike of 125 bps and above 150 bps.
Topline Research also conducted a poll of market participants to assess their views on the upcoming monetary policy announcement scheduled for Aug 22. 
According to the survey, 56pc of participants expect no change in policy rate in the upcoming monetary policy. Around 43pc of the participants anticipate an increase, whereas 1pc of the participants expect a decrease in the policy rate.
Responding to Topline’s second question on their view about the policy rate by the end of FY23, 45pc of the participants expect the policy rate to be in the range of 12pc to 14pc, and 5pc of the participants anticipate it to be in the range of 10-12pc by June 2023.

2,Engineering firm to delist amid ‘tough’ environment,Ados Pakistan Ltd has decided to delist itself from PSX by buying back its own shares currently held by minority shareholders.,"KARACHI: Low sales and “structural changes” in the energy exploration and production (E&P) industry have caused “serious concerns” about the ability of Ados Pakistan Ltd — a stock exchange–listed entity engaged in the supply of oil and gas field–related equipment — to continue its regular operations.
As a result, the engineering company has decided to delist itself from the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) by buying back its own shares currently held by minority shareholders.
“The Voluntary Delisting Committee of the PSX… has approved the minimum buyback price of Rs29 per share,” the stock exchange said in a regulatory notice on Aug 11. The front-line regulator said the company will “qualify for delisting” only if its minimum quantum of the shareholding purchase is 342,800 shares, which is 25 per cent of 1.37 million shares outstanding with the minority shareholders.
The company’s current stock price is Rs26 apiece.
According to company CEO Zia Akbar Ansari, the sponsors are taking Ados Pakistan Ltd private because they wish to protect the interest of the minority shareholders amid an “extremely uncertain” future.
The oil and gas industry has been in a recession-like situation since 2017-18, he said while complaining about foreign firms dumping their products in the local market. “(The) induction of Chinese suppliers/companies into the business has greatly increased competition, resulting in fewer orders and low profit margins in order to compete in the bidding process by state-owned (E&P) companies,” he said in the latest review report by the company’s directors to shareholders. The company posted a net profit of Rs101.9m in the first three quarters of 2021-22 versus a net loss of Rs26.1m a year ago.
The state-owned E&P companies stopped buying equipment from Ados Pakistan Ltd after declaring it disqualified “on the basis of experience”. Declining sales and long-term net losses left the company unable to service the licensing and certification costs for its manufacturing licence from the American Petroleum Institute — a prerequisite for doing business with state-owned E&P firms.
The management of Ados Pakistan Ltd has vowed to generate sufficient cash flows, meet financial obligations and strive for profitability regardless of external market shocks. In this regard, the management is re-evaluating 
the nature of its core business and any “diversification or modification”.

4,US to boost trade with Taiwan,"WASHINGTON: The United States will boost trade with Taiwan in response to China’s  “provocative” behaviour, ...","WASHINGTON: The United States will boost trade with Taiwan in response to China’s  “provocative” behaviour, the White House said on Friday, as it insisted on the right of air and sea passage through the tense strait.
A new trade plan will be unveiled within days, while US forces will transit the Taiwan Strait in the next few weeks, said Kurt Campbell, White House coordinator for Asia-Pacific issues and an adviser to President Joe Biden.
The statement came after Beijing raged at last week’s trip by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, launching its largest-ever military drills around the self-ruled island.
Taiwan has accused China of using the visit by Pelosi, the highest-ranking elected American official to visit in decades, as an excuse to kickstart drills that Taipei called a rehearsal for invasion.
China views Taiwan as its own territory to be seized one day, by force if necessary.
Campbell said Pelosi’s visit was  “consistent” with Washington’s existing policy and that China had  “overreacted.” 
Beijing used the pretext to  “launch an intensified pressure campaign against Taiwan to try to change the status quo, jeopardizing peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and in the broader region,” he said.

5,Indian official voices US concern over Russian fuel,Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Michael Patra's comments are India’s first official public reference to such US concerns.,"NEW DELHI: The United States has expressed concern to India that it was being used to export fuel made from Russian crude, through high-seas transfers to hide its origin, to New York in violation of US sanctions, a top Indian central banker said on Saturday.
The US treasury department told India that an Indian ship picked up oil from a Russian tanker on the high seas and brought it to a port in Gujarat on the west coast, where it was refined and shipped on, said Reserve Bank of India Deputy Governor Michael Patra.
US sanctions on Moscow for its February invasion of Ukraine prohibit the import to the United States of Russian-origin energy products including crude oil, refined fuels, distillates, coal and gas. “The refined output was put back on that ship and it set sail without a destination. In the mid-seas it received the destination so it reached at its course, went to New York,” Patra said at an event to celebrate 75 years of India’s independence.
The US embassy in New Delhi said it had no immediate comment.
Patra’s comments are India’s first official public reference to such US concerns. Delhi has not joined the sanctions against Russia or condemned what Moscow calls a “special military operation” in its neighbour.
The deputy governor said he was told the Russian crude was processed and converted into a distillate used for making single-use plastic. He did not identify the Indian vessel or refiner.
“So that’s the way war works. It works in strange ways,” he said India, one of the world’s top oil importer and consumer rarely bought Russian oil in the past. But since the war started, Indian refiners have been snapping up discounted Russian oil, shunned by many Western countries and companies.

6,IFC identifies impediments to market for NPLs in Pakistan,ISLAMABAD: The non-performing loan (NPL) market in Pakistan is nascent compared with regional peers like India or...,"ISLAMABAD: The non-performing loan (NPL) market in Pakistan is nascent compared with regional peers like India or China, and the secondary market is nearly non-existent, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) observed in a new report.
The IFC report, ‘Non-Performing Loan Market Assessment in Pakistan’ made available on Saturday says the stock of NPLs in Pakistan stood at Rs828 billion at the end of December 2020 (approximately $5bn) with 97pc provision coverage, and the infection ratio was about 9pc, including an average of 17pc for SME loans.
Further, about 10pc of the total outstanding gross advances as of March 2021 had been restructured or allowed a principal deferment under the State Bank debt relief scheme.
The report from the sister organisation of the World Bank presents the current state of Pakistan’s NPL market, identifying the legal, prudential, taxation, and other regulatory and practical impediments for financial institutions and potential NPL investors to create and operate a viable secondary market for NPLs.
Annual trends show a steady rise in commercial banking NPLs since 2017. In 2020, NPLs from the power, cement and agriculture segments were the top three contributors to NPL stock. Loans to the corporate sector comprise roughly 70pc of NPL stock in Pakistan.
The net NPLs of conventional banks reduced from Rs90.4bn in 2016 to Rs75.6bn in 2017 but increased to Rs110bn in 2018 and Rs141.3bn in 2019. In 2020, net NPLs decreased to Rs96.7bn, after loan deferral facilities were implemented by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), which has resulted in delayed NPL recognition.
The NPL to credit portfolio ratio shows that Sindh Bank Ltd, which ranks 6th in terms of NPL portfolio, has the highest infection ratio of 46pc in the banking industry. It also has the highest NPL to equity ratio of 185pc.
National Bank of Pakistan and Bank of Punjab have the second highest infection ratios, each with 15pc. NBP’s annual report shows this larger than usual increase was mainly on account of a general downturn in the economy in 2020 and effects on profitability caused by Covid-19 lockdowns.
Although the energy sector had the most advances, the sugar, electronics, textile, agribusiness, and automobile sectors had the highest rates of NPLs in 2020. During the second half of 2020, Covid-19 and locust plagues reduced Pakistan’s agricultural sector’s growth prospects and put millions of farmers in distress.
Over the past three years, the electronics sector’s infection ratio has risen from 15.7pc to 20.7pc, while the textile sector ratio has improved to 14.7pc from 22pc.
In 2020, the after-tax profits of the banking industry increased to 34pc compared with 21pc in 2019. This was partly on account of general economic relief measures taken by the government and the SBP in response to Covid-19. For the banking sector, these included, a 625 basis point cut in the policy rate, a temporary economic refinance facility (TERF), providing long-term concessionary refinancing at 5 percent for manufacturers and exporters, a Debt Relief Scheme offering principal deferment and restructuring of Rs911bn worth of loans, about 10pc of outstanding gross advances as of March 2021.
The net interest income of banks increased by 25pc, while non-mark-up income jumped by 16pc mainly due to strong capital gains in treasuries, marking an annual increase of roughly 11 times. Compared with strong growth in bottom lines in 2020, the growth of loans and advances was lacklustre at only 2pc.
In the first quarter of 2021, NPLs increased by Rs22bn to Rs850bn. Based on the financial results for the nine months ending Sept 30, 2021, there has been a better-than-expected recovery of loans, evidenced by some of the banks contributing large gross advances booking 75pc higher provision reversals in this period when compared with the same period last year.
The report says there are shortcomings in the existing taxation framework which can create tax disincentives in NPL transactions for investors and banks by increasing the price gap between NPL buyers and sellers. The increase in the price gap may be caused by the taxation framework which delays and limits provisioning expense benefits or write-offs available to NPL buyers and sellers.
There have been few securitisation transactions in Pakistan even though the legal framework for securitisation has been in place for almost two decades. Developing a secondary market through securitisation has not received traction recently.
The legal framework for securitisation enables a secondary market, however, it is impeded by, underlying issues relating to the NPLs quality, recovery, tax allowance of provisions or losses in an NPL sale transaction.
The chronic issues in Pakistan’s recovery system including court and litigation processes are the primary impediments to NPL resolution. Recovery laws in Pakistan are evolving and despite a series of laws enacted to address delays and offer fast track recovery avenues to banks and DFIs, disposal of recovery cases remains a time-consuming process.
As part of ensuring compliance with Financial Action Task Force (FATF) requirements, trust laws have recently been overhauled which means syndicated security arrangements under trust structures, which are common in Pakistan, must be registered annually with the relevant government agency.
