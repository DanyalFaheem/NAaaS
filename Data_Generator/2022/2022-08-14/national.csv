1,SHC suspends ministry notice on ARY News,Media organisations demand channel be restored immediately.,"KARACHI/ISLAMABAD: The Sindh High Court on Saturday suspended an interior ministry notice until Aug 17 that cancelled security clearance of ARY News.
A bench comprising Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhry also issued notices to the interior secretary, the chairman of Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, a federal law officer and other defendants for the hearing on Aug 17.
On Saturday, the ARY News management filed a lawsuit in the high court challenging an interior ministry notice issued on Aug 11 directing Pemra to cancel the NOC issued to ARY News “with immediate effect and until further orders on the basis of adverse reports from agencies”.
The counsel said the SHC directed Pemra on Aug 10 to restore the transmission of ARY News and restrained it from suspending or revoking the channel’s licence until Aug 17. However, that order was not complied with and instead the ministry issued the notice to Pemra, he said.

Media organisations demand channel be restored immediately

He asserted that Saleem Baig was reappointed as Pemra chairman on Aug 12 and he proceeded to call a meeting of the regulatory body on the same day in which he withdrew ARY News security clearance and declined its application pending for the renewal of its broadcast licence in view of the notice issued by the ministry.
The ARY’s counsel argued that the channel’s application for licence renewal was pending with Pemra since September 2019 and the ministry already issued a security clearance on Nov 10, 2021. He contended that security clearance was cancelled in bad faith, politically motivated and aimed at stifling the right of free speech. He said Pemra chairman was appointed overnight without any advertisement apparently to “fix” the channel.
Pemra lawyers, along with a deputy attorney general, argued that the suspended notice was not unsubstantiated and the underlying adverse reports received from agencies would be shared with the court and requested that no interim order be passed until such time.
Media bodies slam govt
Meanwhile, media bodies have slam­med the government‘s move to ban ARY News and demanded the authorities restore the channel. Expressing concerns about the cancellation of ARY News’ NOC, the Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) in a statement asked the authorities to follow due legal process and give the channel an opportunity to explain its position.
“The PBA has always supported responsible journalism and freedom of expression within the parameters of the Constitution. Any violations of the electronic media code of conduct endorsed by the Honourable Supreme Court of Pakistan must be dealt with by following the legal process,” it said.
The Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors has also demanded the government immediately withdraw a notification cancelling the NOC issued to ARY News and noted that the government’s decision had put the jobs of hundreds of workers in jeopardy.
In a joint statement, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) President Afzal Butt and Secretary General Arshad Ansari noted that the government had ignored the Sindh High Court’s order to restore the TV channel by 7pm on Aug 12.
The PFUJ also held a large demonstration outside the ARY’s Islamabad office to show solidarity with the channel. Mr Butt has said the journalists’ body would launch agitation across the country if the channel was not restored.
“It is feared that the negative report of the agencies could be used as a justification to strangle other TV channels in the future,” the PFUJ said.

2,Local NGOs allowed to help flood-hit families,Over one million people have been affected by heavy rains and floods across Pakistan during the prevalent monsoon season.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has allowed all local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to conduct relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities in flood-affected provinces for six months — from August 2022 to February 2023.
It may be recalled that in 2013, the government introduced a policy for “regulation of organisations receiving foreign contributions”. 
The policy serves as a framework to facilitate the NGO sector in accessing foreign funding for their planned activities. Thus, only those local NGOs can carry out relief activities in the flood-battered provinces which have met the required criteria.
Over one million people have been affected by heavy rains and floods across Pakistan during the prevalent monsoon season. 
A total of 580 people have been killed and another 939 injured.
Heavy monsoon rains and increased thunderstorms are forecast across Pakistan till Aug 19, mostly affecting southern areas. 
According to a report issued by the UN Office for the Coor­dination of Humanitarian Affa­irs (UNOCHA) on Saturday, the Balochistan PDMA in collaboration with UN and its partners has launched a rapid multi-sectoral needs assessment in 10 most affected districts.
The exercise is being done in coordination with relevant parties to avoid duplication and ensure complementarity between this and the damaged needs assessment being done by the Asian Development Bank and World Bank.
The assessment pays particular attention to protection, gender-based violence and gender dimensions given the heightened risks during emergencies. The report says humanitarian partners are working together with national and provincial disaster management authorities, the Pakistan Army and the Frontier Corps to conduct rescue and relief activities.
The government has identified food security, agriculture and livestock; health; water, sanitation and hygiene; and shelter and non-food items as priority needs for the immediate flood response.
Some 107,000 livestock, including 29,000 large ruminants, have perished during the floods, according to the National Disaster Managem­ent Authority.

3,Shah­baz Gill seeks bail in sedition case,"Says the investigation against him is complete, no evidence has been recovered that might connect him with the crime.","ISLAMABAD: PTI leader Shah­baz Gill has filed a petition before an Islamabad district and sessions judge seeking post-arrest bail in the sedition case against him.
In his application, Mr Gill said the investigation against him had completed and no evidence had been recovered that might connect him with the crime. 
The investigation had not pointed out any proof to substantiate his ill-intention for making such statement.  
Mr Gill was arrested on Aug 9. A case was registered against him at the Kohsar police station under Pakistan Penal Code sections 124-A (sedition), 131 (abetting mut­iny, or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from his du­­ty), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot if rioting be committed; if not com­­mitted), 153-A (promoting en­­mity between different groups, etc), and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), among others.
According to the FIR, a programme was aired on a news channel in which Mr Gill appeared as a guest. Answering a question, he tried to create a divide between the officers below the rank of brigadier and above, besides trying to affiliate the officers below the rank of brigadier with a political party, it added.
The bail plea mentioned that Mr Gill was entitled for the relief of bail as his physical remand had completed and he was currently in the judicial lockup though his custody was no more required for investigation.
Meanwhile, the Advocate General for Islamabad has challenged the order of the sessions court for dismissing an application seeking physical remand of Mr Gill before the IHC.
The prosecution was seeking physical remand of Mr Gill for another 12 days after expiry of his remand for two day.

4,42 SMEs in Balochistan get funds for agribusiness,"Grants ranging between Rs500,000 and Rs2.5m given to small and medium enterprises in 10 districts.","QUETTA: Forty two small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the agriculture sector of Balochistan were on Saturday provided Rs27 million to uplift their business potential under a project of European Union.
Balochistan’s acting governor Mir Jan Mohammad Khan Jamali distributed the cheques among the enterprises based in Quetta, Pishin, Noshki, Kharan, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Panjgur, Kech, Zhob and Musakhel.
The distribution was held under the European Union-funded Growth for Rural Advancement and Sustainable Progress (GRASP) project, implemented by the International Trade Centre (ITC) in partnership with the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) and Food and Agriculture Organisation.
The grants vary from Rs500,000 to Rs2.5m based on the business plans shared by the SMEs and evaluation carried out under the project.

Grants ranging between Rs500,000 and Rs2.5m given to small and medium enterprises in 10 districts

Addressing the ceremony, Mr Jamali said the provincial government was committed to uplifting the living standard of citizens and wanted them to stand on their own feet.
“The provincial government believes that all efforts aimed at contributing to this cause need to be encouraged at every level,” he said and hoped that the Rs27m grants would play a pivotal role in promoting agribusinesses and spur socio-economic development in Balochistan.
Nadir Gul Barech, chief operating officer at the PPAF, told participants the Fund was working in 10 districts of Balochistan “to enable market growth in the most vulnerable areas and create jobs for the poorest communities”.
He appreciated the European Union and the ITC for investing in the region to improve the business environment and strengthen agricultural value chains in the districts.
He hoped the GRASP project would improve access to finance for agri-based SMEs and boost the trend of entrepreneurship in the far-flung areas of Balochistan.
Roshan Khursheed Bharucha, the PPAF’s chairperson and a former senator, was also confident that the project would bring a positive change in the respective communities and revolutionise the agriculture sector in the province.
GRASP Provincial Lead for Balochistan Jahanzeb Khan noted that small and medium enterprises made up the bulk of businesses in Pakistan and, therefore, they must grow and create jobs for the increasing workforce to achieve broad, sustainable economic growth.
