0,"City, Arsenal maintain perfect starts",Erling Haaland fails to score on his home debut.,"MANCHESTER: Manchester City stormed ominously to the top of the Premier League by cruising to a 4-0 win over Bournemouth, while Gabriel Jesus opened his Arsenal account in a 4-2 win over Leicester City on Saturday.
As soaring temperatures across England forced the need for water breaks at all this weekend’s Premier League games, it was City who were on fire at the Etihad as promoted Bournemouth were blown away.
Erling Haaland failed to score on his home debut, but the Nor­wegian showed there is more to his game than goals as he used his strength before sliding in Ilkay Gundogan to open the scoring.
Kevin De Bruyne then took centre stage with a scintillating finish with the outside of his right foot to find the far corner before the Bel­g­ian turned provider for Phil Foden to make it 3-0 before half-time.
City eased off the gas after the break but added to their lead 11 minutes from time when Jefferson Lerma turned Joao Cancelo’s cross into his own net.

Haaland’s arrival at City was one of the factors behind Jesus’ departure and the Brazilian is already looking like a bargain for the Gunners as he marked his home debut with two goals and two assists to maintain Arsenal’s perfect start.
Jesus was often deployed in wider areas in recent seasons by City boss Pep Guardiola, but was brought to Arsenal to be a number nine as he aims to secure a place at the World Cup later this year with regular games as a centre-forward.
The 25-year-old showed his eye for goal with a sumptuous chip over Danny Ward to break Leicester’s resistance and doubled his tally by heading home a corner at the back post.
William Saliba’s own goal gave Leicester a foothold against the run of play. But the Foxes quickly threw that hope away when Ward dropped a simple cross into the box and Jesus teed up Granit Xhaka to slot home.
Another goalkeeping error at the other end gifted Leicester another goal as James Maddison’s strike squirmed under Aaron Ramsdale.
Arsenal, though, again responded instantly to avoid a nervy finale as Gabriel Martinelli fired into the far corner before Jesus hit the post with the chance to seal his hat-trick.
Steven Gerrard won the first managerial clash between him and former England teammate Frank Lampard as Aston Villa beat Everton 2-1 to get off the mark.
Goals from Danny Ings and Emi Buendia eased the pressure on the former Liverpool captain after a run of two wins in their previous 12 games dating back to last season.
However, Villa had to survive a nervy finish as Lucas Digne’s own goal gave Everton hope as Emi Martinez twice denied Anthony Gordon.
Leeds United missed the chance to join City and Arsenal on six points after blowing a 2-0 lead at Southampton.
Rodrigo’s double put the visitors in command at St. Mary’s, but goals from Joe Aribo and Kyle Walker-Peters may have saved Ralph Hasenhuttl’s job after reports this week suggested he could be the first Premier League sacking of the season.
Brighton & Hove Albion and Newcastle United failed to build on their impressive starts last weekend as both missed chances aplenty in a 0-0 draw at the Amex.
It was also scoreless between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Fulham at Molineux after Aleksa­ndar Mitrovic saw a late penalty saved by Jose Sa with the chance to win it for the visitors.

1,Shakib Al Hasan returns as Bangladesh T20 captain,All-rounder given the nod to lead the side for the upcoming Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates and the World Cup in Australia.,"DHAKA: Shakib Al Hasan on Saturday was named to return as Bangladesh’s Twenty20 international captain after he bowed to a Bangladesh Cricket Board ultimatum to scrap a deal with a betting site.
The all-rounder was given the nod to lead the side for the upcoming Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates and the World Cup in Australia.
“Shakib realised his mistake,” BCB cricket operations chief Jalal Yunus told reporters as he announced the decision. “He is a very important player for us.”
Earlier this month Shakib announced a partnership with Betwinner News, a portal operated by a gambling firm based in the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao.
He wrote on his social media pages that it was the  “one and only source of sports news!”
Gambling is illegal in Bangladesh and he was forced to cancel the deal after the BCB president, Nazmul Hassan, issued an ultimatum ordering him to choose between the national team and Betwinner.
Shakib captained Bangladesh to seven wins and 14 defeats in 21 T20Is until he was banned for two years — one of them suspended — in 2019 after he failed to record corrupt approaches.
Shakib, who also returned as Test captain in July, replaces wicketkeeper-batsman Nurul Hasan as Bangladesh’s T20 skipper.
Nurul was retained in the Asia Cup squad despite undergoing surgery on a finger in Singapore last week in the hope that he would regain his fitness by the time the tournament starts on August 27 in Dubai.
“His stitches will be removed on August 21. Hopefully, the result will be positive,” said chief selector Minhajul Abedin.
Three-time Asia Cup finalists Bangladesh will face Sri Lanka and Afghanistan in Group ‘B’ of the competition, with two teams progressing to the next round.
Former captain Mushfiqur Rahim also returned to the side after being rested for the T20 series in Zimbabwe, where Bangladesh lost a series against the hosts for the first time.
Pace bowler Ebadot Hossain was handed a place in the T20 side for the first time after he impressed in Tests and One-day Internationals, while batsman Sabbir Rahman and all-rounder Mohammad Saifuddin returned after a long gap.
Bangladesh will play a tri-nation tournament in New Zealand in October involving the hosts and Pakistan before they travel to Australia for the T20 World Cup.
Bangladesh squad: Shakib Al Hasan (captain), Anamul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim, Afif Hossain, Mosaddek Hossain, Mahmud­ullah Riyad, Mahedi Hasan, Mohammad Saifuddin, Hasan Mahmud, Mustafizur Rahman, Nasum Ahmed, Sabbir Rahman, Mehidy Hasan, Ebadot Hossain, Parvez Hossain, Nurul Hasan and Taskin Ahmed.

2,NZ cruise past demoralised West Indies to win T20 rubber,KINGSTON: New Zealand pulverised a demoralised West Indies by 90 runs in the second T20 International to take an...,"KINGSTON: New Zealand pulverised a demoralised West Indies by 90 runs in the second T20 International to take an unbeatable 2-0 in the three-match series here at the Sabina Park on Friday.
“It has been great to come back to Sabina Park and get a good score today,” said Phillips in reflecting on his time playing at the venue for the Jamaica Tallawahs in the Caribbean Premier League.
In a one-sided encounter which magnified the rapid decline of the two-time World T20 winners over the past 12 months, the Black Caps piled up 215 for five.
They then limited the home team to just 125 for nine in reply to hand the Caribbean side a sixth defeat in their last seven matches in the format.
Glen Phillips’ blistering 76 off 41 balls with six sixes and four fours highlighted the tourists’ dominant batting performance and earned him the man of the match award after captain Kane Williamson chose to take first strike.
He received excellent support from Daryl Mitchell (48) in an 83-run fourth-wicket stand while opener Devon Conway again made a useful contribution in getting to 42.
Mitchell Santner and Michael Bracewell returned identical figures of three for 15. Ish Sodhi made it seven wickets to spin when he removed Rovman Powell for 21.
“Credit to the West Indies bowlers up front because they did well in taking pace off the ball, but we executed our overall plans better this time around.”
Needing victory to keep the series alive going into the final match at the same venue on Sunday, West Indies crumbled to spin for the second time in six days.
However, Obed McCoy, top-scorer with an unbeaten 23, and Hayden Walsh featured in an unbroken last-wicket stand of 38, a record for the team in T20 Internationals.
They had lost all 10 wickets to spin — a first in the entire history of T20 Internationals — in the last fixture of the five-match series against India in Florida last Sunday.
At 87-9 at the start of the 17th over, the West Indies on the verge of defeat by an even wider margin.
McCoy was also the most successful bowler with figures of three for 40 amid the carnage when New Zealand batted.
“We would ideally have liked to play two specialist spinners but Akeal Hosein is being rested so that was a setback,” said beleaguered West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran.
“These are the times we have to stick together as a group. It’s not easy on the guys.”
Summarised scores:
NEW ZEALAND 215-5 (G. Phillips 76, D. Mitchell 48, D. Conway 42; O. McCoy 3-40); WEST INDIES 125-9 (O. McCoy 23 n.o., R. Powell 21; M. Bracewell 3-15, M. Santner 3-15).

The former world number one, up a set and leading 4-1 in the second, looked headed for an easy passage into the last four. But Gauff dug in and rallied to force the second set to a tiebreak before 15th-seeded Halep finish off the 10th seed in the tiebreak to maintain her dominance over the American. 
In four career meetings, Gauff has yet to take a set off Halep, who next faces another American in seventh seed Jessica Pegula — a 6-3, 6-3 winner over Kazakh Yulia Putintseva. 
In other quarter-final action, Brazil’s giant-killer Beatriz Haddad Maia claimed another victim as she upset Olympic champion Belinda Bencic with a 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 comeback win.  The South American, who stunned world number one Iga Swiatek in the third round, will meet former world number one Karolina Pliskova who prevailed 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 against Zheng Qinwen of China. 
KYRGIOS WIN STREAK ENDED BY HURKACZ 
At the ATP Montreal Masters, Nick Kyrgios’ nine-match winning streak ended in quarter-finals when eighth-seeded Pole Hubert Hurkacz blasted his way to a 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (5-7), 6-1 victory. 
Hurkacz will next face Norwegian fourth seed Caper Ruud, who strolled into the last four by sweeping aside sixth-seeded hometown favourite Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-1, 6-2. 
At the bottom of the draw, Dan Evans completed a comeback to defeat American Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, needing two match points to overcome Paul in two and a quarter hours. 
But the chance of an all-British semi-final at this elite level fell away as Jack Draper lost 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 to Spain’s Pablo Carreno Busta after saving a pair of match points.

5,"Benzema nominated for Ballon d’Or, Messi misses out",The honour for the best player in the world will be awarded on Oct 17.,"PARIS: Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema is among the 30 nominees on the shortlist for the prestigious men’s Ballon d’Or trophy, organisers France Football magazine announced on Friday. 
The French international has had an incredible season for Real Madrid, scoring 44 goals in 46 games and helping them win the Champions League and LaLiga. 
Other nominees are Manchester United forward Cristiano Ronaldo, Manchester City striker Erling Haaland — who has just joined the club from Borussia Dortmund — and last season’s joint Premier League top scorer Mohamed Salah of Liverpool. 
But seven-time reigning winner Lionel Messi paid a high price for an underwhelming first season with Paris St-Germain when he was left off the list. 
Messi had been an ever-present amongst the nominations since 2006 and a regular feature in the top three since 2007 with the exception of 2018. 
A change in the format has also worked against the Argentine superstar with the Ballon d’Or no longer acknowledging the best player over a calendar year. 
Instead, it is based on a season’s record highlighting “the individual performances” and the “decisive and impressive character” of the nominees, according to the criteria. PSG team-mate Neymar also misses out. 
Benzema is joined on the 30-man list by team-mates Thibaut Courtois, Casemiro, 2018 winner Luka Modric, Vinicius and former Chelsea player Antonio Rudiger. 
Beaten Champions League finalists Liverpool have seven players nominated, the most of any club. 
They are Trent Alexander-Arnold, Luis Diaz, Fabinho, Sadio Mane, since transferred to Bayern Munich, Darwin Nunez, Salah and Virgil Van Dijk.
The honour for the best player in the world will be awarded on Oct 17.

BELFAST: Afghanistan defeated Ireland by 22 runs in the third T20 international in Belfast on Friday as they reduced the hosts’ lead to 2-1 in a five-match series.
Rahmanullah Gurbaz top-scored in Afghanistan’s 189-5 after the tourists lost the toss, with the opener’s innings well supported by Najibullah Zadran, whose 42 off just 18 balls featured five sixes.
Ireland, looking to take an unassailable 3-0 lead, then slumped to 85-7 in reply before the experienced George Dockrell and debutant Fionn Hand led an Ireland recovery.
The eighth-wicket duo put on 74 in just over six overs against a seasoned Afghanistan attack including established T20 internationals, Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman.
Hand made a fine 36 off only 18 balls before he was caught attempting to scoop Naveen-ul-Haq.
Dockrell finished unbeaten on 58 off 37 balls, including six fours and two sixes, but Ireland still came up short as they ended the match on 167-9.
The series continues at Stormont on Monday.

Lille fight back for deserved point at Nantes
PARIS: Lille battled for a well-earned point at Nantes as substitute Ismaily equalised late on to secure a 1-1 draw in Ligue 1 on Friday. 
The Brazilian fullback played a series of intricate passes before slotting home in the 76th minute as Lille came back after Moses Simon put the hosts ahead just before the half hour mark in sweltering conditions. 
Nigeria international Simon scored from a corner but Nantes had to endure a second half on the backfoot as Lille squandered several good chances and also forced some key saves before equalising.
