0,World body okays eligibility for recognition of accreditation programme: PMC,Says process expected to be completed in one year.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) on Saturday stated that after completing the mandatory requirements to become eligible for the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) for recognition of its accreditation programme, it has applied to the federation to initiate the process.
The statement comes in the wake of apprehension that graduates from medical colleges in Pakistan may not be able to appear in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), which is mandatory for practice in the US, after January 2024.
The defunct Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) had also initiated the process for the WFME accreditation and invited its delegation to visit Pakistan, but in 2019 the PMDC was dissolved and replaced with the PMC. Subsequently, the process went off-track.
The PMC claimed that in the first step WFME, after assessing the PMC’s application, had approved its eligibility for the WFME recognition as an accrediting body and its accreditation programme.

Says process expected to be completed in one year

“PMC and WFME will now coordinate to schedule the visit of WFME’s international assessors who will undertake a site visit to Pakistan to inspect the PMC and its entire regulatory systems as well as physically inspecting multiple colleges recognised by the PMC. The entire process, including physical site assessment and inspection, is expected to be completed within 12 months and certainly before 2024,” it stated.
“WFME recognition of PMC and its accreditation programme will enable all colleges recognised and accredited by PMC to be considered as WFME accredited and graduates of these colleges licensed by PMC would have the ability to train and work in the USA and internationally without any restriction.”
“PMC will be launching next week an extensive National Recognition Programme for the WFME recognition focusing on assisting all medical colleges in capacity building so as to ensure every college meets the new 2022 accreditation standards,” the body stated.
In addition, Pakistani doctors’ association in the US has agreed to provide its continued support to the PMC to achieve the WFME recognition with its members providing their time and resources to assist in the national programme being launched by commission, it stated.
The PMC also said the Federal State Medical Boards (FSMB) of the United States that conduct the USMLE licensing exam along with the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) in the United States have agreed to the request of PMC President Dr Arshad Taqi to collaborate on multiple areas, specifically for sharing technical knowledge and assistance to improve the standard and structure of PMC’s National Licensing Exam.
As part of the collaboration, a high-level delegation consisting of the top leadership of FSMB, NBME and also IAMRA, which is the International Association of Medical Regulators, will be visiting Pakistan early in 2023 to initiate the collaboration programmes. 
In addition to meeting the PMC and stakeholders, they will also be visiting some top medical colleges and teaching hospitals in Pakistan, it stated.
The US Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG), after realising that the quality of foreign graduates was deteriorating due to mushroom growth of private-for-profit colleges, on Sept 21, 2010, announced that after January 2023 only graduates of countries having recognition from WFME will be allowed to appear in USMLE.

1,IHC sets aside welfare attachés’ selection policy,ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has set aside the policy introduced by former special assistant to the...,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has set aside the policy introduced by former special assistant to the prime minister Zulfi Bukhari for selection of community welfare attachés (CWAs) in 12 missions in Europe, US, UK and other countries.
The IHC’s division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan  issued a detailed order on the appeals filed by the government against the order of the single member bench comprising Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb.
The Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis in 2019 changed the selection criteria by amending the policy. 
As per amendment, officers are required to secure 40pc marks in interview and 60pc in written test to qualify for foreign posting.
Previously, a candidate required 20pc in interview and 80pc marks in the written test.
Interestingly, applications were sought under the previous policy and the candidates qualified the written test in accordance with the policy introduced in 2016.
However, the overseas ministry in December 2019 changed the selection criteria after the candidates had qualified the written test. Subsequently, some candidates challenged the recommendation of the interview committee not to appoint them against the posts of community welfare attaches in Pakistan’s missions abroad.
Shahid Mehmood Khokhar, the counsel for the petitioners, adopted before the court that on Oct 27, 2019, the overseas ministry published an advertisement inviting applications for the selection of CWAs under the 2016 selection policy.
The court observed that the process for selection of CWAs had already commenced under the policy of 2016 as it existed then it is only when the interviews were to be conducted, the policy was changed and the selection criteria was altered in the mid process. Though it is correct proposition that no candidate acquires vested right till he/she is selected, but no justification has been put forth by the appellants for the change in the policy criteria and it only smacks mala fide as if issued to favour someone.”
“If the policy had been amended before process was started, the decision would have been otherwise. It was the legitimate expectation of every candidate that he or she shall be governed by applicable policy or the law for the process of selection, which was defeated when the same was changed. Moreover, as noted in the impugned judgement that amendments made in the policy of 2016 were never made public which also raises concerns for all the testing candidates,” the court order added.
The court observed that the Selection Board was headed by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Zulfi Bukhari adding that SAPM “is not a Minister for State or a Federal Minister but only enjoys status for the purposes of perks and privileges. The said incumbent cannot participate in the cabinet proceedings and though can sit in the parliament but only as a spectator”.
Subsequently, the court set aside the policy amended by the said board and upheld the decision of the single member bench.

3,AJK tables bill seeking separate body for holding LB polls,"MUZAFFARABAD: Only two days after the announcement of the schedule for the long overdue local bodies (LB) elections,...","MUZAFFARABAD: Only two days after the announcement of the schedule for the long overdue local bodies (LB) elections, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government on Saturday tabled a constitutional amendment bill in the Legislative Assembly withdrawing this responsibility from the region’s election commission.
The 15th constitutional amendment bill, which was tabled in the house by minister for local government and rural development Khawaja Farooq Ahmed with the full backing of the two major opposition parties - Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) - envisaged creation of a separate election commission forlocal government bodies, as used to exist before the 13th constitutional amendment of 2018.
The appointment of election commissioner for local bodies would be made by the prime minister in consultation with the opposition leader.
The bill was referred by the house to a 10-member house committee comprising lawmakers from both sides of the divide for its report.
It may be recalled that last time the people of Azad Kashmir elected their LB representatives for a four-year term was in 1991.
From 1995 onwards every government has been running these institutions either through the politically appointed administrators or district administration officials.
During the PPP rule in Azad Kashmir, some civil society activists had knocked the doors of superior judiciary for a direction to the government to hold LB polls at the earliest to transfer power at the grassroots level in accordance with its manifesto.
After a prolonged litigation initially in the High Court and later in the Supreme Court, the sitting government was finally directed by the apex court to hold these polls by August 30, 2022.
However, the deadline was extended by the apex court on the government’s request until October 15 , in keeping with which the election commission had announced on Aug 11 the schedule for LB polls, fixing September 28 for polling.

5,Call to ensure participation of women in decision making,NDU professor says women possess better skills to find innovative solutions to problems...,"ISLAMABAD: Women’s participation in decision making must be ensured at all levels as women have some inbuilt negotiation capability and better skills to manage conflicts and create innovative solutions to problems, said National Defence University (NDU)’s Professor Dr Shaheen Akhtar.
She was addressing a training workshop organised by the Centre for Peace, Development and Reforms (CPDR). The day-long workshop was attended by around 25 women hailing from Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Dr Akhtar underlined the importance of structural reforms that are indispensable for encouraging women’s participation in the decision making process in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
She also highlighted the impact of the Kashmir conflict on the lives of women in Azad Kashmir and how it had restricted the participation of the already neglected female lot in policy-making circles and many other significant areas.

NDU professor says women possess better skills to find innovative solutions to problems

“AJK is not a conflict zone, but a part of a disputed territory; therefore, the impact of conflict here becomes inevitable, affecting the individual grooming at many levels,” she noted.
Dr Akhtar also stated that the government needs to take some concrete steps to reach out to this vulnerable and often ignored section of society in order to make female participation in decision making and governance a reality.
Women of Azad Kashmir have a huge potential to represent themselves and can play an important role in the peace-making and conflict resolution process by being effective mediators.
She castigated the practice of restricting women in some set roles and spoke about the importance of women’s participation in many aspects of governance.
Nighat Khan, the head of a London-based organisation, New Vision for Women, spoke about the significance of individual grooming, and of how an assertive and self-confident class of women can bring a tremendous change in the whole structure of society.
She emphasised the importance of personal grooming to enhance the skills of women and develop their strong characters to rebut the misrepresentation and obfuscation of facts in the society.
“Women in Azad Kashmir are well qualified and have a huge potential to represent themselves and make an impact in policy-making in the region,” she observed.
She reminded the participants that women still have a long way to go in fully releasing their potential in building a just society, especially in the regions affected by violent conflict.
Several women from various parts of Azad Kashmir highlighted different issues like lack of gainful employment, healthcare, transport, electricity and other facilities that become obstacles for them to achieve their goals.
Fatima Anwar said that women are great negotiators because of their inherent compassionate attitude and inclination towards peace and the common well-being of people.
“If given opportunities, women can bring peace to society through negotiating a solution based on a win-win situation for the parties,” she added.
Mahvish Bakht said the Kashmiri women were major stakeholders in society and managing conflicts and maintaining peace. It is essential to have women in the centre of peace-making, mediation and the negotiation process to find amicable solutions to political disputes.
The session concluded with the distribution of certificates among participants by Dr Shaheen Akhtar, Nighat Khan, Fatima Anwar and Mahvish Bakht.

6,Pakistan has faced severe impact of climate change this year: minister,"""We lost several thousand trees to unprecedented forest fires this year,"" Sherry Rehman says.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s protected areas have suffered immensely due to the catastrophic impact of climate change.
This was stated by Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman while speaking at Trail 5 where a clean-up drive was organised by her ministry to mark the 75th Independence Day.
“We lost several thousand trees to unprecedented forest fires this year. Most of them due to the heatwave and dry weather,” Ms Rehman said.
“As human activities reduced due to the pandemic, wildlife, foxes, monkeys, jackals and so on reclaimed their spaces in the national park. Now, as we attempt to coexist, the first rule of sharing space is to make sure you’re leaving it behind just as you found it,” she added.
Littering of single-use plastics was becoming an issue in the Margalla Hills National Park, and if ingested by any wildlife it could be toxic and potentially life-threatening for them, she cautioned.
“Margalla Hills National Park is our national asset. Islamabad is the only capital close to such a large national park in the world,” Ms Rehman said, requesting hikers, citizens and tourists to bring reusable bags and bottles for recreational activities.
She reminded the gathering that the ministry and the CITES Management Authority had imposed a ban on the import of all exotic mammals.
“The IWMB is also recovering exotic pets and releasing them into their natural habitats. I would also urge provinces to do their bit to build climate resilience and take national goals forward on securing our future as the world heats up,” she said.

She was speaking to participants at an event organised by the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (Sparc) titled ‘Independence from tobacco’ to celebrate International Youth Day 2022.
The speakers shed light on the importance of banning novel tobacco products and highlighted that these products are biggest threats to the younger generation.
“A total of 61 million of youngsters are an asset for our country and the government realises that. We will not let any industry deliberately target our youth,” she said.
NHS Secretary Mirza Nasiruddin Mashhood Ahmad expressed concerns that 1,200 children begin smoking daily and 170,000 people die due to tobacco induced diseases every year.
He said the tobacco control cell at the ministry was active and it encouraged parliamentarians, civil society, academia and media to collaborate in countering sale and promotion of tobacco products among youth.
Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids Country Head Malik Imran Ahmed, said tobacco industry was engaging youth icons for paid social media content.
“If these attempts of tobacco industry are not kept in check through proper mechanisms, they will grow more powerful and keep being the cause of deaths and diseases in the country,” he said.
Country Lead Vital Strategies and former technical head Tobacco Control Cell of NHS Ministry Dr Ziauddin Islam said in Pakistan there was no federal or provincial legislation regarding novel products i.e. nicotine pouches, e-cigarettes and vapes. Anees Jillani, Member, Board of Director Sparc, said since 1992, Sparc has been working for the dismal plight of the children across the country through research, awareness raising and improved policy making and implementation.
