The British author, who spent years under police protection after Iranian leaders ordered his killing, underwent emergency surgery and was placed on a ventilator after Friday’s assault in which a 24-year-old man, Hadi Matar, rushed the stage where Rushdie was about to deliver a lecture and stabbed him in the neck and abdomen.
According to his agent Andrew Wylie, the nerves in one of Rushdie’s arms were severed and his liver damaged in the attack, and he  “will likely lose one eye.” Rushdie, 75, had been living under an effective death sentence since 1989 when Iran’s then supreme leader issued a religious decree against him. 
Security was not particularly tight at Friday’s event at the Chautauqua Institution. Witnesses said Rushdie was seated on an auditorium stage and preparing to speak when Matar jumped up from the audience and managed to stab him several times before being wrestled to the ground by staff and other spectators. Matar was finally cuffed and taken into police custody.
The fatwa followed publication of the novel  “The Satanic Verses” which sparked fury among some Muslims who believed it was blasphemous.
A doctor in the audience provided emergency first aid on the spot before Rushdie was airlifted by helicopter to the hospital in nearby Erie.
State police said Matar, from Fairfax, New Jersey, had been formally charged with attempted murder, but otherwise provided no information on his background or what might have motivated him.

1,UK hit by latest rail strikes,"LONDON: Football fans and holidaymakers faced travel woe on Saturday as train drivers walked out across the UK, the...","LONDON: Football fans and holidaymakers faced travel woe on Saturday as train drivers walked out across the UK, the latest in a series of industrial strikes amid spiralling inflation.
Members of the Aslef union at nine train companies are staging a 24-hour strike over pay and working conditions, bringing large parts of the network to a standstill, with no service in some areas of the country.
“The companies have said that they cannot, or will not, give our members an incr­ease,” said Mick Whelan, Aslef’s general secretary.
“They blame the government... while the government says it’s down to the train operators. So we are caught in a Catch-22 situation where each side blames the other.” 
The train network has already been crippled by previous strikes, including a three-day walkout in June that was the country’s biggest for 30 years. They, and other industries, are demanding higher pay to mitigate inflation that is forecast to hit 13 percent by the end of the year.
Further rail strikes are planned for August 18 and 20, with London Under­ground and bus staff set to stage action on August 19. The Department for Trans­port said claims it was blocking negotiations were  “entirely false”.
“We have said from the outset we urge the unions and industry to agree a deal that is fair for railway staff, passengers and taxpayers,” it said in a statement.
Bin collectors and staff in the postal, court and telecom sectors are among those who have voted to strike.

2,Swiss artist sculpts sprawling model castle on dried river bank,"""I imagine the life of the people walking under the arches, the bridge, looking at the monuments, looking at the city,"" he says.","SAUBRAZ: Swiss artist Francois Monthoux’s annual project to build clay sculptures on the banks of Switzerland’s Toleure river has sprawled into a captivating castle complex this year as the drought afflicting Europe allows him to extend his dream world.
Monthoux began this year’s project with modest ambitions six weeks ago but the drought allowed him to build an entire city of spires. Now he has mixed feelings: he wants it to rain, but is sad at the thought of his dream world disappearing when it does.
“I imagine the life of the people walking under the arches, under the bridge, looking at the monuments, looking at the city,” said Monthoux, who works with clay from the dried bed of the Toleure river in the Vaud canton in western Switzerland.
“So, I enter a bubble, and I become a dreamer ... I see their world being created under my fingers,” he added.
Monthoux, a nature lover, says he is sad to see plants dying all around him and  “it would be a catastrophe” if an enduring drought meant he could keep going with the project for years. At the same time, he knew from the outset it was temporary.
“Of course, I’m a little bit sad, because I’m sad that the form I gave to the matter will disappear,” he said. Visitors to the sculpture are enjoying it while it lasts.
“I don’t have words to say what I feel, because it’s ... it’s just sublime,” said Heidi Butty, a Vaud resident.

3,Broad swathe of China swelters in high temperatures,"""Compared to years before, the temperature this year is particularly high,"" says one citizen.","SHENZHEN: Several regions of China including the major southwestern city of Chongqing baked in temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) on Saturday, while the country’s national observatory continued its red alert for extreme heat.
In Zhejiang, home to many factories and exporters, a meteorological official said that the eastern province has broken its previous record for high temperature days this year, with 31 days above 35C and 16 days above 38C.
Along with Chongqing, which saw temperatures up to 42.1C on Saturday, Hubei, Hunan, Shandong, Anhui, Xinjiang, Jiangxi and Fujian were among the provinces and regions where temperatures exceeded 35C.
A thunderstorm appeared to have helped spare Shanghai from breaking its 40.9C record on Saturday, though residents of the commercial hub of 25 million still expressed fatigue from the ongoing heatwave.
“It’s like being in a steamer, it’s really hot,” said 70-year old resident Shen Fengming.  “Even if you don’t walk around outside, you’ll still end up sweating.” 
“I went to our port and walked around,” said 45-year-old Huang Yi, who works at a container port.  “It was just an hour, but my clothes and pants were all wet. Compared to years before, the temperature this year is particularly high.” 
On Saturday Shanghai’s meteorological observatory reported that the city has seen 40 days with temperatures exceeding 40C this year, peaking so far on July 13 at 40.9 degrees.
Last week China’s weather bureau warned that the country’s average ground temperatures had risen much more quickly than the global average over the past 70 years and would remain  “significantly higher” in the future as the challenges of climate change mount.
Much of Europe has seen weeks of baking temperatures, with wildfires raging in France and parts of England facing a severe drought, as successive heatwaves renewed the focus on climate change risks.

4,Tea workers strike against dollar-a-day wages in Bangladesh,"One worker says their wages are barely enough to buy food, let alone other necessities.","DHAKA: Nearly 150,000 workers at more than 200 Bangladeshi tea plantations went on strike on Saturday to demand a 150 percent rise to their dollar-a-day wages, which researchers say are among the lowest in the world.
Most tea workers are low-caste Hindus, the descendants of labourers brought to the plantations by colonial-era British planters.
The minimum wage for a tea plantation worker in the country is 120 taka a day — about $1.25 at official rates, but only just over a dollar on the free market. One worker said that was barely enough to buy food, let alone other necessities.
“Nowadays we can’t even afford coarse rice for our family with this amount,” said Anjana Bhuyian, 50. “A wage of one day can’t buy a litre of edible oil. How can we then even think about our nutrition, medication, or children’s education?” she said.
Unions are demanding an increase to 300 taka a day, with inflation rising and the currency depreciating, and said that workers in the country’s 232 tea gardens began a full-scale strike on Saturday, after four days of two-hour stoppages.
“Nearly 150,000 tea workers have joined the strike today,” said Sitaram Bin, a committee member of the Bangladesh Tea Workers’ Union.
“No tea worker will pluck tea leaves or work in the leaf processing plants as long as the authority doesn’t pay heed to our demands,” he said.

Odinga has 52.54 percent of the vote against 46.76 percent for Deputy President William Ruto, according to early afternoon figures from the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission based on results from about 30 percent of polling stations.
The election is being closely watched as a test of stability in Kenya, which is one of the continent’s most dynamic democracies but has seen past votes marred by rigging and deadly violence.
As the wait for results dragged on, the election commission on Friday acknowledged that the tallying process was moving too slowly and appealed for the nation to be patient.
Odinga, 77, is making his fifth stab at the top job — this time with the support of his longtime foe, the outgoing President Uhuru Kenyatta, who has already served two terms and cannot run again.
Ruto, 55, has been deputy president for almost a decade but was left out in the cold after a pact between Odinga and Kenyatta in 2018 that dramatically shifted political allegiances.
Although the campaign was mired in acrimony and widespread disinformation, polling day passed off largely peacefully with only a few incidents reported of electronic ID machines malfunctioning and delays in opening some polling stations.
Turnout was about 65 percent, much lower than the 78 percent recorded in 2017, a reflection, some observers say, of the disenchantment with the political elite, particularly among young people.
The state of the economy was a key issue during the campaign, with Kenyans struggling to make ends meet as global prices for essential goods such as food and fuel soar.
The winner of the presidential race needs to secure 50 percent plus one vote and at least a quarter of the votes in 24 of Kenya’s 47 counties. If not, the country will be forced to hold a runoff within 30 days of the original vote.
Both frontrunners have pledged to ensure calm after the outcome is known, with Kenyans still haunted by the deadly violence that followed the 2017 and 2007 polls.
But observers say that with the race so close, an appeal to the Supreme Court by the losing candidate is almost certain, meaning it could be many weeks before a new president takes office.
Kenyans had been left confused when television stations which have been providing rolling coverage of the election, suddenly stopped broadcasting provisional results late on Thursday after various channels showed different outcomes.
Media Council of Kenya CEO David Omwoyo insisted there was nothing underhand about the stoppage or the discrepancies in numbers.
“No one has asked anyone to stop the tallying and projection of the results,” he said Friday.  “We are liaising with media houses to align the reporting.”

The Yuan Wang 5 is described as a research and survey vessel by international shipping and analytics sites, but according to Indian media it is a dual-use spy ship.
New Delhi is suspicious of Beijing’s increasing presence in the Indian Ocean and influence in Sri Lanka, seeing both as being firmly within its sphere of influence.
The Yuan Wang 5 was originally due to call at Sri Lanka’s Chinese-run Ham­bantota port on Thursday, only for Colombo to ask Beijing to indefinitely defer the visit following India’s objections.
But Sri Lanka’s foreign ministry said the vessel had been granted permission to dock at Hambantota on Tues­day and remain for six days.
It is required to keep its Automatic Identification System (AIS) switched on while in Sri Lanka’s exclusive economic zone, and is not allowed to carry out scientific research in Sri Lankan waters, the ministry added.
Sri Lanka’s harbour master, Nirmal P. Silva, said:  “The diplomatic clearance was received by me today. We will work with the local agent appointed by the vessel to ensure logistics at the port.”

“We have no work,” said the man in his forties as a lone fan pumped hot summer air around his clothes store.
The two camps are  “defending their personal interests”, he charged, declining to provide his surname due to security concerns.
Political deadlock has left Iraq without a new government, president or prime minister following general elections 10 months ago.
Supporters of firebrand cleric Moqtada Sadr, who once led an anti-US militia and who has millions of devoted followers, stormed Iraq’s parliament late last month and began a sit-in, first inside the building and then in its grounds.
They were angered after their Shia rivals, the pro-Iran Coordination Frame­work, nominated a candidate they saw as unacceptable for prime minister.
The Sad­rists are now demanding early elections.
The Framework brings together the party of ex-prime minister Nuri al-Maliki, a longtime Sadr foe, and the Hashed al-Shaabi, a pro-Iran former paramilitary network now integrated into the security forces.
The alliance says it wants a new government as quickly as possible, and its supporters on Friday began their own sit-in to press for that demand.
Framework supporters have set up tents on a road leading to the Green Zone, which is home to government and diplomatic buildings — including parliament.

Anne Heche

 
LOS ANGELES: Holly­wood actor Anne Heche has been declared legally dead, one week after she crashed her car into a Los Angeles building, a spokeswoman said.
Heche, 53, had been comatose in hospital with a severe brain injury since the fiery collision on August 5.
Having lost all brain function, she is  “legally dead according to California law,” though her heart is still beating as her family keeps her body on life support while exploring organ donations, spokeswoman Holly Baird said.
“Today we lost a bright light, a kind and most joyful soul, a loving mother, and a loyal friend,” the family said in a joint statement.
“Anne will be deeply missed but she lives on through her beautiful sons, her iconic body of work, and her passionate advocacy.
“Her bravery for always standing in her truth, spreading her message of love and acceptance, will continue to have a lasting impact.” Heche, best known for 1990s movies  “Donnie Brasco” and  “Six Days, Seven Nights” as well as a high-profile relationship with talk show host Ellen DeGeneres, crashed her car into a two-story house in the Mar Vista neighbourhood of Los Angeles.
The violent collision resulted in  “structural compromise and... heavy fire” at the scene, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The ensuing blaze took 59 firefighters more than an hour to contain and fully extinguish, the department said.
Local media reported that preliminary tests of Heche’s blood had come back positive for narcotics, though more were needed to ensure the drugs had not been administered in the course of her treatment.
Celebrity gossip outlet TMZ, citing unnamed police sources, said Heche had tested positive for cocaine and fentanyl, with the latter sometimes used for pain relief in clinical settings.
Heche rose to fame with her role on the soap opera  “Another World,” for which she won a Daytime Emmy in 1991. She was nominated for a Tony award for her appearance in  “Twentieth Century” on Broadway in 2004.

11,Taliban violently disperse protesting women in Kabul,"""If the Taliban want to silence this voice, it’s not possible,"" says one protester.","KABUL: Taliban fighters beat women protesters and fired into the air on Saturday as they violently dispersed a rare rally in the Afghan capital, days ahead of the first anniversary of their return to power. 
Since seizing control on Aug 15 last year, the Taliban have rolled back the marginal gains made by women during two decades of US intervention in Afghanistan. 
About 40 women — chanting “bread, work and freedom” — marched in front of the education ministry building, before the fighters dispersed them by firing their guns into the air, a correspondent reported. 
Some women protesters who took refuge in nearby shops were chased and beaten by Taliban fighters with their rifle butts. 
The demonstrators carried a banner which read “August 15 is a black day” as they demanded rights to work and political participation. “Justice, justice. We’re fed up with ignorance,” they chanted, many not wearing face veils. 
“Unfortunately, the Taliban from the intelligence service came and fired in the air,” said Zholia Parsi, one of the organisers of the march. 
“They dispersed the girls, tore our banners and confiscated the mobile phones of many girls.” But protester Munisa Mubariz vowed to continue fighting for women’s rights. 
“If the Taliban want to silence this voice, it’s not possible. We will protest from our homes,” she said. 
Some journalists covering the demonstration — the first women’s rally in months — were also beaten by the Taliban fighters, a correspondent saw. 
While the Taliban authorities have allowed and even promoted some rallies against the United States, they have declined permission for any women’s rally since they returned to power. 
After seizing control last year, the Taliban promised a softer version of the harsh Islamist rule that characterised their first stint in power from 1996 to 2001. 
But many restrictions have already been imposed, especially on women, to comply with the movement’s austere vision of Islam. 
Tens of thousands of girls have been shut out of secondary schools, while women have been barred from returning to many government jobs. 
Women have also been banned from travelling alone on long trips and can only visit public gardens and parks in the capital on days separate from men. 
In May, the country’s supreme leader and chief of the Taliban, Hibatullah Akhundzada, ordered women to fully cover themselves in public, including their faces — ideally with an all-encompassing burqa.

12,Mar-a-Lago — security ‘nightmare’ that housed classified documents,Trump is under federal investigation for possible violations of the Espionage Act.,"WASHINGTON: The seizure of classified US government documents from Donald Trump’s sprawling Mar-a-Lago retreat spotlights the ongoing national security concerns presented by the former president, and the home he dubbed the Winter White House, some security experts say.
Trump is under federal investigation for possible violations of the Espionage Act, which makes it unlawful to spy for another country or mishandle US defence information, including sharing it with people not authorised to receive it, a search warrant shows.
As president, Trump sometimes shared information, regardless of its sensitivity. Early in his presidency, he spontaneously gave highly classified information to Russia’s foreign minister about a planned operation by the militant Islamic State group  while he was in the Oval Office, US officials said at the time.
But it was at Mar-a-Lago, where well-heeled members and people attended weddings and fundraising dinners frolic on a breezy ocean patio, that US intelligence seemed especially at risk. While Secret Service provided physical security for the venue while Trump was president and afterward, they are not responsible for vetting guests or members.
The Justice Department’s search warrant raises concerns about national security, said former DOJ official Mary McCord. Clearly they thought it was very serious to get these materials back into secured space, McCord said. 
“Even just retention of highly classified documents in improper storage — particularly given Mar-a-Lago, the foreign visitors there and others who might have connections with foreign governments and foreign agents — creates a significant national security threat.” 
Trump, in a statement on his social media platform, said the records were  “all declassified” and placed in  “secure storage.”  McCord said, however, she saw no  “plausible argument that he had made a conscious decision about each one of these to declassify them before he left. After leaving office, she said, he did not have the power to declassify information.
Monday’s seizure by FBI agents of multiple sets of documents and dozens of boxes, including information about US defence and a reference to the  “French President,” poses a frightening scenario for intelligence professionals.
“It’s a nightmarish environment for a careful handling of highly classified information,” said a former US intelligence officer.  “It’s just a nightmare.”
