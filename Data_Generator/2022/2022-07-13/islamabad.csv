0,Billion tree project on NAB’s radar,"PAC asks anti-graft watchdog to revive Malam Jabba, Bank of Khyber probes, pursue BRT case in Supreme Court.","ISLAMABAD: Months after the ouster of former prime minister Imran Khan, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has started six inquiries and four investigations into alleged corruption in the Billion Tree Tsunami Afforestation Project aimed at implementing the ‘Green Growth Initiative’ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
The programme launched by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government to mitigate the impacts of climate change came under scrutiny after the issue was brought up in the meeting of the Public Accounts Committee – the apex parliamentary accountability body – and a recent letter to the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) by the climate change ministry for its audit.
On July 7, NAB submitted before the PAC that it was investigating the grafts allegations pertaining to plantations, including woodlots, enclosure, farm forestry (free distribution of plants) and procurement of seeds, polythene bags and similar equipment.

PAC asks anti-graft watchdog to revive Malam Jabba, Bank of Khyber probes, pursue BRT case in Supreme Court

According to a report, NAB’s Directorate General in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is conducting six inquiries and four investigations to probe these allegations. As per the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) 1999, after receipt of a complaint, the bureau verifies the facts and then conducts an inquiry which is subsequently upgraded into an investigation.
Following the investigation, the anti-graft watchdog files reference in the accountability court after the approval of the chairman.
Revival of cases
The graft cases against the PTI leaders that were either stalled or scrapped will likely be revived after the PAC directed the bureau to revive the investigation into the Malam Jabba case and the Bank of Khyber scam. It also asked the bureau to pursue the BRT case in the Supreme Court.
In July last year, NAB had given a clean chit to Azam Khan, then prime minister’s principal secretary, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mehmood Khan and former defence minister Pervaiz Khattak in the 275-acre Malam Jabba skiing-chairlift resort case.
As per NAB’s report, the inquiry against them was authorised by the competent authority to probe the allegations of “lease of forest land measuring 270 acres”, “extension of lease period from 15 to 33 years” and “irregularities/violations in bidding process”.
The bureau was also probing the illegal appointments in the Bank of Khyber; however, this inquiry was closed a couple of years ago.
The parliamentary accountability body also asked NAB to approach the Supreme Court regarding the probe into the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project in Peshawar.
The report said the inquiry into BRT project was authorised on July 20, 2018 on the order of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) dated Feb 5, 2018.
The PHC order had stated that “the delay, the contract-awarding process, feasibility and all the issues related to the project of Peshawar Sustainable Bus Rapid Transit Corridor Project (BRT) are all shady and shaky and as such the NAB authorities are directed to conduct proper investigation/inquiry and submit its report before the next date”.
However, the KP government had gotten relief from the Supreme Court. The apex court in its order on August 31, 2018, granted interim relief to the provincial government by suspending the operation of the PHC order and said “the matter is subjudice in the Supreme Court.”
The decision to revive cases against the PTI leadership came days after Tayyaba Gul, who secretly recorded the video of former NAB chairman retired Justice Javed Iqbal told the PAC that former officials of the Prime Minister’s Office, including the PM’s close aide Azam Khan and Tahir A. Khan, ‘misused’ the video to pressurise the NAB chief to drop the cases.

7,Negative tactics can never dampen Kashmiris’ spirit of freedom: Mushaal,ISLAMABAD: Narendra Modi-led India was making every effort to dampen the Kashmiris’ spirit of freedom but all...,"ISLAMABAD: Narendra Modi-led India was making every effort to dampen the Kashmiris’ spirit of freedom but all negative tactics will only strengthen their commitment to the liberation movement.
This was stated by Peace and Culture Organisation ChairpersonMushaal Hussein Mullick in a video message on the occasion of Kashmir Martyrs Day.
Mushaal Mullick, who is the wife of detained Kashmiri leader Mohammad Yasin Malik, paid tributes to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives against Dogra imperialism.
She said the troops of the Dogra ruler martyred 22 Kashmiris one after another outside the Central Jail in Srinagar during court proceedings against one Abdul Qadeer when a young man started the call for prayers (Azaan).
“He was shot dead by the Maharaja’s soldiers, and in all 22 youth sacrificed their lives to complete the call to prayer,” she added.
Ms Mullick said no less brutal than the Dogra force, the Indian occupation forces had martyred hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris and grievously hurt millions of families in India-held Kashmir.
“Yet, they have failed to break the will of the Kashmiris and weaken their resolve to secure freedom from Indian occupation,” she added.
“The world remained silent and failed to take any action against the Dogra forces’ barbarism and today when Indian forces are crossing all limits of brutalities and state barbarism, the world powers and human right organisations are again observing criminal silence,” she added.
She said India’s illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019, aimed at erasing the distinct identity of the people of Kashmir had further fortified the Kashmiris’ quest for freedom and self-determination and lent even greater poignancy to the Kashmir Martyrs’ Day.
While condemning state-terrorism being perpetrated by the Indian occupation forces in occupied valley, she called upon the international community to take practical steps to stop India from the brutalisation of the Kashmiri people including extra-judicial killings and illegal attempts to change the demographic structure of the region.
Ms Mullick said India must be held accountable for its unspeakable crimes against the Kashmiri people, adding that lasting peace and prosperity in South Asia could not be established without resolving the lingering Kashmir dispute.

12,Slum dwellers devise their own waste management system,"Initiative leads to clean localities, generates additional income for garbage collectors, activist says...","ISLAMABAD: As the civic agency of the federal capital has ignored slum areas, the dwellers have launched their own solid waste management system.
At the same time, the model adopted by the residents of slums with the help of development partners showed that civic agency can also generate finances from the garbage generated in Islamabad.
With no garbage collecting mechanism, four slum - H- 9 community, I-9 community, G-7 Faisal Colony and G-7 Allama Iqbal Colony - were almost surrounded by huge piles of garbage with the only visible solution being open burning of the waste.
However, after collective efforts of the local community and the development partners, including Tearfund and Pak Mission Society, implemented the “Saaf Mahaol” initiative, not only leading to cleaner localities but also generating additional income for those involved garbage collecting.

Initiative leads to clean localities, generates additional income for garbage collectors, activist says

“This initiative has been able to control almost 90 per cent of open dumping and waste burning in the area,” said Saima Williams, thematic lead climate action for Pak Mission Society.
Briefing media about the project, she said that there were three components of the system implemented at these four slums – door to door collection of garbage, selling of some material to junk dealers and utilising the organic waste for compost.
“We had to start by creating awareness, now people understand the importance of clean localities so they give domestic waste to the collection staff.”
She added that after segregation, some items were sold to the junk dealers that generated almost Rs700 daily to the team of 3-4 persons.
“The organic waste ends at a project - Haryali Hub - a make-shift arrangement where green is turned into compost and the plastic bags into tiles with solar energy,” she added.
To ensure the sustainability of Saaf Mahool, responsibility for solid waste management services was transferred to the targeted communities which gave them the authority and control over the operation, management and maintenance services, ensuring the system’s long-term viability.
The Solar Thermal Plastic Waste Recycling Plant at Haryali Hub is a locally made plant, making one tile in 15 minutes using almost one kg of plastic bags, which are used as stepping stones in gardens etc.
The compost is formed as the green waste is separated from the rest of the garbage and stored in especially designed containers for 45 days.
“From 5,000 kg of green waste, we produce 1,500 kg of high-quality organic compost which is bought in advance by the nurseries of H-9 area,” said Sumbal, Haryali Hub’s Project Manager.
“As environmentalists, we believe that waste is a resource which has a lot of potentials and if utilised properly, it can lead to different business streams,” she added.
She said the CDA and MCI can replicate the model at large scale to prevent degradation of environment at the landfill sites. It will help raise finances for the civic agency too.
