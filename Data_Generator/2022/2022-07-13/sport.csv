Russian and Belarusian players were banned from Wimbledon this year after Russia sent troops to Ukraine but Moscow-born Rybakina was able to play as she had switched her allegiance to Kazakhstan in 2018.
At the weekend Russia appeared to claim her Grand Slam success when Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpischev described Rybakina as  “our product”.
“It’s very nice! Well done Rybakina! We win the Wimbledon tournament,” Tarpischev said.
Russia’s ex-world number one Yevgeny Kafelnikov reinforced that view in a post on Twitter on Monday.
“Buying a ready to use product from the producer does not take a lot of brains,” wrote retired Kafelnikov.
Rybakina’s parents still live in Moscow and she had been reluctant throughout the tournament to elaborate on how much time she spends in Russia.
“The transition from a junior to a professional career is very difficult,” Rybakina, 23, told journalists in Kazakhstan when asked to comment on the  “product” tag.
“A good team is needed. Not everyone is able to continue at professional level and achieve some successes. Only a small number [can] and in this way I am very lucky. So I am of course not really in agreement with that phrasing.”
Speaking alongside Rybakina, Kazakh tennis federation’s deputy chief Yuri Polskiy took issue with the Russian federation’s position.
“If it is the result of [Russia’s] work, why did they let her go so easily? In 2018, Shamil Tarpischev said himself that he did not consider Elena Rybakina a tennis player of promise,” Polskiy said.
“I think with that it’s time to put an end to this because there is too much hype around this subject.”

1,Bumrah-inspired India thrash England in first ODI,Fast bowler Bumrah took a career-best 6-19 as the hosts were dismissed for just 110 in 25.2 overs.,"LONDON: Jasprit Bumrah routed the top order as India thrashed 50-over world champions England by 10 wickets in the first One-day International here at The Oval on Tuesday.
Fast bowler Bumrah took a career-best 6-19 as the hosts were dismissed for just 110 in 25.2 overs.
India captain Rohit Sharma, who won a good toss, then made an unbeaten 76 before Shikhar Dhawan (31 not out) cut Brydon Carse for four as the tourists finished on 114-0 with more than 31 overs to spare.
The victory gave 2023 World Cup hosts India a 1-0 lead in a three-match series that continues at Lord’s on Thursday.
Bumrah produced an opening burst of 4-9 in five overs against an England side featuring arguably their strongest batting line-up at this level since their 2019 World Cup final triumph.
England avoided the embarrassment of being dismissed for less than their record low completed ODI score of 86 all out against Australia at Old Trafford in 2001.
But an innings featuring four ducks in the tops six — Jason Roy, Joe Root, Ben Stokes and Liam Livingstone were all out for nought — saw England bowled out with nearly half of their 50 overs remaining.
Bumrah, 28, returned to clean up Brydon Carse and David Willey to surpass his only other five-wicket haul of his 71 match ODI career — 5-27 against Sri Lanka at Pallekelle five years ago.
Mohammed Shami took 3-31 in seven overs as he became the fastest Indian and joint-third fastest to 150 ODI wickets in matches played on his 80th appearance.
England’s innings boasted just four double-figure contributions, captain Jos Buttler top-scoring with 30 and Willey managing 21.
This was England’s sixth ODI defeat by 10 wickets and their heaviest defeat at home when batting first.
Buttler has now lost three out of four games since succeeding Eoin Morgan as England’s full-time white-ball skipper.
The tone was set when Roy played on trying to drive Bumrah’s fourth ball of the day.
Two balls later, Root was undone by a Bumrah delivery that lifted off a good length.
And in the next over Test captain Stokes fell for a golden duck when an inside edge off Shami was brilliantly caught by diving wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant.
Jonny Bairstow, fresh from two hundreds in England’s seven-wicket win in the Covid-delayed fifth Test against India at Edgbaston, then fell for seven, caught behind off Bumrah.
Bairstow, Root and Stokes all missed the recent T20 series which India won 2-1.
This was the first time the star trio had played a 50-over international together since England’s World Cup final win over New Zealand three years ago.
They managed just seven runs between them.
England were 26-5 in the eighth over when Livingstone, walking across his crease, was clean bowled leg-stump by Bumrah.
Buttler tried to turn the tide, hitting six fours, only to hoist Shami to deep square leg, where Suryakumar Yadav held a well-judged catch just inside the rope.
No. 11 Reece Topley drove leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal for England’s lone six but two balls later the innings was over when Bumrah bowled Willey with a thunderbolt yorker.
Rohit was quickly into his stride and went to fifty in style when he hooked Carse for a third six in just 49 balls faced.

2,Pakistan start preparations for CWG hockey,"Pakistan are placed in pool ‘A’ alongside Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Scotland.","LAHORE: After failing to qualify for the 2023 World Cup, Pakistan’s senior hockey squad on Tuesday started preparations for their next assignment, the Commonwealth Games, being held in Birmingham from July 28 to Aug 8.
The players attended the first day of the training camp here at the National Hockey Stadium No.2 ground.
The camp started with many changes in the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) in the wake of Pakistan’s failure to qualify for the 2023 World Cup after they finished a poor fifth in this year’s Asia Cup held at the GBK Sports Complex in Jakarta in May-June. The continental event featured teams from eight countries.
Chief selector Manzoor Junior, after being given the new role of national junior team’s manager by the PHF in controversial circumstances, left the federation in protest while the former camp commandant/manager Khawaja Junaid stepped down after the Asia Cup.
In place of Manzoor, Olympian Kaleemullah, one of the selection committee members, was elevated to the position of chief selector while assistant coach Ajmal Lodhi was handed the designation of team manager.
Pakistan’s record in the Commonwealth Games hockey event is not impressive.
After hockey was included in the games in 1998, Pakistan were able to win bronze medal in 2002 at Manchester -- followed by silver in the 2006 edition staged at Melbourne.
For this year’s edition featuring teams from 10 hockey-playing nations, Pakistan are placed in pool ‘A’ alongside Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Scotland. Pool ‘B’ comprises India, England, Canada, Wales and Ghana.
AIKMAN JOINS CAMP
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Dutch hockey coach Siegfried Aikman has joined the national training camp after missing the Abbottabad conditioning camp which ended before Eid-ul-Azha.
Aikman, who missed the camp in Abbottabad due to visa-related problems, has come to the country with a working visa.
Though Pakistan have shown some improvement under Aikman, they are yet to win a title.
The Asia Cup was Aikman’s first assignment though he had joined the team in December 2021, just a few days before the Pakistan squad left for Bangladesh to participate in the Asian Champions Trophy.
Earlier this year, under his coaching Pakistan toured three European countries — Holland, Belgium and Spain. The green-shirts drew the two-test series 1-1 against both Holland and Spain while lost the one-off test against world champions Belgium.
Now a big challenge awaits Aikman and his team in Birmingham where a strong-looking Australia, who have superbly maintained their top position in all the six editions of the Commonwealth Games, will again be a major hurdle for all the participating teams like England, New Zealand, India and Pakistan.

A solid 158-run opening partnership between Sadeera Samarawickrama and Nishan Madushka put Pakistan on the backfoot after the tourists added just 46 runs to their overnight score of 277-7 to end their first innings at 323 all out after electing to bat first on Monday. 
Samarawickrama smashed unbeaten 91 runs off 99 balls laced  with 13 boundaries. Nuwanidu Fernando made 78.  When the stumps were drawn, opener Madushka (39) and Chamika Karunaratne (14) were at the crease.
For Pakistan, spinner Mohammad Nawaz took two wickets while Salman, Naseem Shah and Yasir Shah claimed  one apiece.
Earlier on Tuesday, Agha Salman, who remained not out the other day batting at number nine, struck 55 laced with three boundaries.
On Monday, skipper Babar Azam (88) top-scored for the tourists and added 134 runs with Azhar Ali (43) for the third wicket.

4,Sri Lanka stun Australia to level Test series,GALLE: Prabath Jayasuriya claimed 12 wickets in his dream debut and Dinesh  Chandimal smashed his maiden double...,"GALLE: Prabath Jayasuriya claimed 12 wickets in his dream debut and Dinesh  Chandimal smashed his maiden double hundred to secure Sri Lanka’s  memorable series-levelling victory in the second Test against Australia  on Monday. 
Chandimal smashed 206 not out, first double hundred by a Sri Lanka  batter against Australia, providing the bedrock for the team’s imposing  554 in reply to Australia’s 364 in the first innings. 
Possessing a handy 190-run cushion, Sri Lanka unleashed their  three-pronged spin attack and Jayasuriya routed Australia for 151 in  their second innings claiming 6-59 at the Galle International Stadium. 
Sri Lanka’s victory by an innings and 39 runs, which came in four  days, is also the first time they have inflicted an innings defeat on  Australia. 
Australia after the heavy loss also  lost their top World Test Championship position to South Africa.
“South  Africa take over as the new leaders on the latest standings with a   win-loss percentage of 71.43 percent, while Australia drop to second   with 70 percent after their first Test loss in the current period,” the   International Cricket Council said.
“Our boys bounced back really well after losing the first match  and the debutants did an amazing job,” Sri Lanka skipper Dimuth  Karunaratne said. 
“I knew from the beginning that Prabath would be key for us, he  did a great job for us.”
Jayasuriya’s match haul of 12-177, which  earned him the man-of-the-match award, is the best figures on a Test  debut for Sri Lanka. 
It was a stunning display by the 30-year-old who would not have  played the match but 
for a spate of Covid-19 cases that forced Sri Lanka  to field three debutants. 
The hosts even had to substitute opener Pathum Nissanka after the first innings as the opener tested positive for the virus. 
While wicket-keeper Alex Carey missed a couple of stumpings,  Australia paid heavily for casually wasting all their reviews on Sunday. 
They were particularly stung when Chandimal, then on 30, edged  Mitchell Starc but Australia had run out of reviews and could not  challenge the not-out decision. 
After Sri Lanka resumed  on 431-6, Chandimal, who bagged the man-of-the-series award, mounted a  spectacular late charge. 
Having reached 185, Chandimal smashed Starc for a boundary and  followed it with back-to-back sixes to bring up his double hundred. 
Five of Sri Lanka’s top six batsmen registered 50-plus scores to put the hosts in a commanding position. 
Australia began their second innings briskly with David Warner and Usman Khawaja playing their shots. 
Warner fell in the penultimate over before tea but wheels came off Australia’s innings when the returned after the break. 
Jayasuriya rocked them with a two-wicket over to get rid off Khawaja (29) and Steve Smith, who was dismissed lbw for a duck. 
Australia slumped from 49 for no loss to 74-4 when Ramesh Mendis removed Travis Head for five. 
Jayasuriya sent back Marnus Labuschagne (32) to break Australia’s  back and effectively sealed the match removing Cameron Green and  Mitchell Starc in the same over. 
‘PAKISTAN TO BE MORE CHALLENGING’
Sri Lanka next host Pakistan, who are already in the island nation playing a practice game, for two Tests starting on Saturday in Galle.
Sri Lanka’s big win gives them confidence ahead of the opener but Karunaratne said Pakistan would be a stronger force than the Aussies, with their ability to handle spinners better.
“Pakistan is a strong side, a brilliant team,” said Karunaratne. “I think it will be more challenging than Australia. They play spin well.”

5,Wimbledon champion Djokovic hopes to play in 2023 Australian Open,"“As things stand now, I cannot travel to Australia and the US, but I am hoping to get positive news,” he says.","

BELGRADE: Serbia’s Novak Djokovic celebrates with the Wimbledon trophy during a welcoming ceremony.—AFP

 
BELGRADE: Novak Djokovic is hoping to be allowed to play at the Australian Open next year despite being kicked out of the country over his vaccination status in January, the Serbian told state television RTS on Monday.
Djokovic won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles in 2021 but was unable to defend his Melbourne Park crown due to his refusal to be vaccinated against Covid-19.
He lost his French Open title after going out to eventual champion Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals this year but retained his Wimbledon crown on Sunday.
The 21-time major champion cannot currently enter the US without being vaccinated against Covid, while his deportation from Australia carried with it a three-year re-entry ban.
“As things stand now, I cannot travel to Australia and the US, but I am hoping to get positive news,” Djokovic told RTS after being greeted by thousands of fans in front of Belgrade City Hall.
“I believe things will change for Australian Open. For the US Open there is not much time, but hope dies last. I would like to play at the US Open and Australia Open, but even if I do not it’s not the end of the world.”
Australia scrapped a rule that required international travellers to declare their Covid vaccination status last week.
Then Prime Minister Scott Morrison said when Djokovic was removed from Australia in January that his re-entry ban could be waived  “in the right circumstances”.
After finishing 2021 one major short of a rare calendar-year Grand Slam, Djokovic’s season has not panned out as he would have envisaged after missing the Australian Open and losing to Nadal at Roland Garros.
However, the 35-year-old has won the last four editions of Wimbledon in 2018, 2019, 2021 and 2022, with the 2020 tournament cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He is now one Grand Slam title behind record holder Nadal, who has won 22 majors.
On Monday, thousands of people waved Serbian flags and shouted  “Nole! Nole!” - Djokovic’s nickname in Serbian.
Authorities organised fireworks and a concert. Djokovic addressed the fans from the balcony of City Hall and threw 20 signed tennis balls into the crowd.
SERBIAN WINS SEVENTH WIMBLEDON CROWN
On Sunday, Djokovic stayed serene amid a frenzied atmosphere to  tame fiery Australian Nick Kyrgios in an engrossing final on Sunday,  lifting a seventh Wimbledon trophy.
Rallying from a set down, Djokovic exhibited ice-cool  nerves in sweltering conditions to win 4-6 6-3 6-4 7-6(3) for his fourth  consecutive trophy at the grasscourt major.
Competing in a men’s record 32nd major  final on a sun-bathed Centre Court, the 35-year-old was facing an  unseeded opponent who had never been beyond the quarter-finals at a  Grand Slam before this fortnight.
Interestingly, Serbian Djokovic slipped four places in the world rankings released on Monday despite retaining the Wimbledon title due to the men’s tour governing body’s controversial decision not to award ranking points for the Grand Slam event.
The ATP and WTA made the call after Wimbledon organisers barred Russian and Belarusian players due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Russian and Belarusian players have been permitted by the ATP and WTA to carry on competing at tour events but under a neutral banner. Kyrgios slips to 45th in the rankings, a drop of five places.
Kyrgios in the final did not allow Djokovic any look at  his delivery in the opening set, getting 77 per cent of his first  serves in and firing down seven aces.
A couple of well-disguised  drop shots from Kyrgios helped him set up two breakpoints in the fifth  game and a double fault from Djokovic brought up the first break of  serve, which was enough for the unseeded Kyrgios to take the lead.
Focused  from the start, Kyrgios, however, did not forget to entertain the crowd  when he could. There was an underarm serve and he hit a return on the  half volley between his legs to delight the Centre Court crowd.
No  one, however, expected it to be an easy straight-sets match with  Djokovic having not lost a match on the manicured lawns at the All  England Club since he retired injured during his 2017 quarter-final  against Czech Tomas Berdych.
Djokovic’s delivery went up a gear  and the Serb slowly but surely started demonstrating why he is  considered the best returner in the sport.
He would have been  hoping to read the Kyrgios serve better and for his opponent’s level to  drop and once it did in the fourth game of the second set, Djokovic was  ready to pounce.
With Djokovic  serving to level the match at one set apiece, however, the 27-year-old Kyrgios raised  his game to set up four break points, only for the top seed to save all  of them and convert his first set point to leave the Australian fuming.
Kyrgios was furious with himself and poured out his frustrations in a lengthy rant aimed at his box.
During  the first week of the grasscourt Grand Slam, Kyrgios played his usual  role of pantomime villain but as his run got deeper, the 27-year-old  presented a much calmer demeanour to reach the biggest match of his  career.
The Australian maverick was back to his usual hot-headed self during the third set as Djokovic started playing pristine tennis.
Kyrgios got broken from 40-love up in the ninth game and continued swearing and shouting at his box.
Djokovic  ignored the drama across the net and after holding serve to bag the  third set he calmly collected his bag and left the court, leaving his  opponent sitting on his chair and shaking his head in frustration.
After  both players failed to create a breakpoint in the fourth set, Djokovic  dominated the tiebreaker and sealed the Championship on his third match  point after three hours when Kyrgios found the net on a return.

6,Ten Hag off to perfect start as United trounce Liverpool 4-0,Liverpool looked jaded and on the back foot for much of the match.,"BANGKOK: Manchester United got their pre-season off to a flying start with a 4-0 rout of rivals Liverpool in Thailand on Tuesday, giving new manager Erik ten Hag a big boost in his first match in charge.
Liverpool looked jaded and on the back foot for much of the match against a United team with superior fitness who capitalised on a series of first-half errors in Bangkok with three goals in the space of 21 minutes.
Liverpool had the best of the early action before United opened the scoring after 12 minutes when a Bruno Fernandez cross was poorly handled by the Liverpool defence, allowing Jadon Sancho to fire into bottom corner.
Liverpool came close to an equaliser soon after when new signing Fabio Carvalho’s shot beat goalkeper David de Gea and cannoned off the far post, with Luis Diaz latching onto the ball in the ensuing scramble and hitting the upright.
But United remained in control, with chances for Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay troubling Liverpool.
United doubled their lead on the half hour mark when Fernandez and Anthony Martial linked up before laying the ball off to Fred, whose deft finish sailed over outstretched keeper Alisson Becker.
United made it 3-0 three minutes later when Martial dispossessed substitute Rhys Williams and coolly lifted the ball over the advancing Alisson, while Diogo Dalot almost added a fourth when his angled shot struck the post.
Managers Juergen Klopp and Ten Hag made 10 changes around halftime, after which Liverpool emerged better organised, with chances from their 75 million euros striker Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah, who was frustrated late on by De Gea and the woodwork. But United completed the demolition with 14 minutes left, Facundo Pellistri latching onto an Eric Bailly pass on the counter and converting with ease after a one-two with Amad Diallo.

7,Mehidy shines in ‘ideal conditions’ as Bangladesh stop rot,PROVIDENCE: Spinner Mehidy Hasan and Bangladesh exploited  “ideal conditions” to defeat the West Indies by six...,"PROVIDENCE: Spinner Mehidy Hasan and Bangladesh exploited  “ideal conditions” to defeat the West Indies by six wickets in Sunday’s rain-affected first One-day International.
Shoriful Islam’s haul of four for 34, his best in ODIs, limited the West Indies to 149 for nine batting first in a fixture reduced to 41 overs-per-side before Mahmudullah’s unbeaten 41 saw the visitors to the target with more than nine overs to spare.
After 2-0 losses in both the preceding Test and T20 International series, Bangladesh’s ninth consecutive ODI win over the West Indies puts the pressure on the home side going into the second match at the same venue on Wednesday.
Mehidy played his part in a disciplined bowling effort with three wickets.
Senior pace bowler Mustafizur Rahman set the tone for the match when he dismissed dangerous opener Shai Hope for a first ball duck after Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal put the home side in to bat.
Mehidy’s victims included West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran and earned him the man of the match award.
“This is a really good result for us because rain prevented us from practising properly for the last few days,” said the spinner.
“These were ideal conditions for us. I just tried to bowl in the right areas and everything worked out well for us.” Shamarh Brooks top-scored with 33 for the hosts with the next best effort being an unbeaten 19 from Anderson Phillip in an unbroken last-wicket partnership of 39 with Jayden Seales (16 not out).
Shoriful went one better than Mustafizur in taking the wickets of Brandon King and Brooks in his opening over before adding the Guyanese pair of all-rounder Romario Shepherd and spinner Gudakesh Motie.
However the coveted fifth wicket of the innings proved elusive as Bangladesh’s fielders dropped three catches to extend the last-wicket resistance of Phillip and Seales.
With the sun coming out to ease the batting conditions, Bangladesh were always favoured to overhaul the target and 37 from Najmul Hossain together with 33 by Tamim at the top of the order set them on their way.
Tamim was run out and Najmul because the first wicket of ODI debutant Motie, although those were mere stutters on the journey to victory as wicketkeeper-batsman Nurul Hasan joined Mahmudullah in an unbroken fifth-wicket stand of 40 to see their side to victory.
“In hindsight our total today obviously wasn’t enough but it was difficult to get more batting first on that track,” was Pooran’s frank assessment of the conditions at the start of the match.
“Conditions improved later on but having said that, we should have pushed harder for more success at the start of their innings to give ourselves a fighting chance.”

Nielsen, a Dane who rides for EF, wore the polka dot mountain points jersey for several days after claiming it on stage two.
Tadej Pogacar led the main peloton across the line almost nine minutes later.
German Lennard Kamna leapt from 21st to second after escaping with the breakaway. Although he could not keep up on the final climb, the Bora rider still gained more than eight minutes on the race leaders and is just 11sec adrift of Pogacar.
Pogacar earlier lost a second team-mate to Covid, while his key lieutenant Rafal Majka also tested positive but was cleared to race by the UCI as he is considered not infectious.
School-holiday crowds, mainly families, were in party mode along the sinuous route, and even more expected on the two huge mountain stages coming up.
A day after the rest day, the cyclists rode through bright sunshine and 24C temperatures as the winding 148km through the valleys of the Haute Savoie skirted the major climbs.
The ride was delayed twice.
The first delay came when a team bus became stuck on a hairpin bend before the start and had to be lifted out by snowplough.
Then the racing was interrupted by demonstrators on the road with 38km left.
The stage was halted for 10 minutes after half a dozen climate activists tried to stop riders on the road before being pulled out by police and a senior organisers’ official.
The activists, one of them wearing a t-shirt saying “We have 989 days left”, sat on the road some 36 kilometres from the finish in Megeve, a Reuters witness said.
The activists were pulled off the road by police, helped by Tour organisers’ Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) general director Yann Le Moenner.
ASO declined to comment on that specific incident when contacted by Reuters.
Later, Tour director Christian Prudhomme said: “These things (protests) happen, it’s the ransom of success.”
Stage leader Alberto Bettiol rode through a cloud of pink from a flare before being asked by a race official to get off his bike just before organisers said the stage had been stopped.
Ten minutes later, race director Christian Prudhomme ordered racing to resume.
“Since the government doesn’t care about the climate crisis, we need to come and take over the Tour de France to refocus attention on what matters for our survival,” climate activists movement Derniere Renovation said in a statement.
“We need to make our government react as they lead us to the slaughterhouse.” 
Wednesday’s 151km run from Albertville to Col du Granon features two beyond category climbs is considered by some of the contenders, including fourth-placed Geraint Thomas of Ineos, as the toughest in this year’s visit to the Alps.
The final climb rises to 2,400 metres while the Col du Galibier before it climbs to 2600.
“I’m comfortable with those kinds of altitudes,” the 2018 champion said on Monday.
On the July 14, Bastille Day, on Thursday the race returns over some of the same mountains but takes in three beyond category climbs before finishing at the Alpe d’Huez where crowds are traditionally less family based and an atmosphere of anarchy can reign.
On Sunday, Bob Jungels (AG2R Citroen) of Luxembourg landed a sensational 63km solo break to win stage nine at the Tour de France in the first Alpine finish.
Jungels fended off the final climb advances of Thibaut Pinot (Groupama FDJ), Jonathan Castroviejo (Ineos Grenadiers) and Carlos Verona (Movistar) to bring home his first-ever Tour stage win, and a first victory on the road since 2019.

India, set 216 for victory, were in trouble at 13-2 inside three overs.
But a stunning century from right-handed Suryakumar Yadav, who batting at number four cracked an astonishing 117 off just 55 balls, including 14 fours and six sixes, kept them in the hunt.
But when the 31-year-old after striking his maiden T20 International century fell in the penultimate over, India were 191-7 and England all-rounder Chris Jordan then closed down the game after recalled left-arm quick Reece Topley had taken 3-22 in four overs.

India won this series 2-1 following victories at Southampton and Edgbaston.

Put into bat after losing the toss, Zimbabwe posted 236-5 in 20 overs with Raza, Sean Williams (53) and captain Craig Ervine (34) the leading run makers at Queens Sports Club.
Singapore never looked like matching the run rate of the home team and managed just 125-7 with unbeaten Janak Prakash (32) top scoring and Surendran Chandramohan (21) the only other contributor of note.
Tendai Chatara (3-14) and Blessing Muzarabani (2-21) were the most successful bowlers for Zimbabwe, who are seeking a sixth T20 World Cup tournament appearance.
New Zimbabwe coach and former star batsman Dave Houghton had called for exciting, positive cricket from a team that last month suffered 3-0 series losses to visiting Afghanistan in both white-ball formats.
Batting at number five, Pakistan-born right-hander Raza heeded the rallying cry with a man-of-the-match performance that included five sixes and eight fours.
“This was a great start. The coach has emphasised the need to not only start the tournament well but finish it equally well. Our goal is to qualify for Australia,” said Raza.
“We want the other seven teams to know that we are determined to secure one of the two qualifying places on offer and I think we did that really well.
“The win over Singapore is history now. The focus of my team-mates and I have already shifted to the match against Jersey tomorrow.”
A United States side including former South Africa fast bowler Rusty Theron defeated Jersey by eight wickets in the other Group A clash.
Jersey, one of four contenders in Bulawayo hoping to reach the T20 World Cup for the first time, made 154-5 off 20 overs.
Batting at number three, Asa Tribe struck an unbeaten 73, including six sixes, for Jersey, a tiny London-ruled island between England and France.
The USA surpassed that total by reaching 159-2 with 11 balls to spare and opener Steven Taylor (101 not out) starred. He faced 55 balls and fired five sixes and 12 fours.
Four-time qualifiers the Netherlands lived up to their billing as Group B favourites with a 52-run victory over Papua New Guinea.
The Dutch won the toss and posted 163-7 with Stephan Myburgh (39) top scoring while Semo Kamea and Charles Amini took two wickets each for the Pacific islanders.
Papua New Guinea were all out for 111 in 19.4 overs having never matched the Netherlands run rate. Sese Bau (35) was the only batsman to impress while Logan van Beek (3-17) was the pick of the Dutch bowlers.
Uganda surprised Hong Kong in the same group, winning by two wickets in a low scoring affair. Replying to 87-9, the Africans reached 88-8 off the third ball of the final over.
The Bulawayo finalists will join 14 other nations at the T20 World Cup in Australia from Oct 16.

13,Ferrari’s Leclerc wins Austrian GP after late scare,SPIELBERG: Charles Leclerc survived a late throttle scare to win the Austrian Grand Prix for Ferrari on Sunday and...,"SPIELBERG: Charles Leclerc survived a late throttle scare to win the Austrian Grand Prix for Ferrari on Sunday and roar back as Formula One world championship leader Max Verstappen’s closest rival.
Red Bull’s Verstappen had to settle for second, still with a comfortable 38-point lead over the Monegasque after 11 of 22 races and banking a bonus point for fastest lap on top of his Saturday sprint win.
Mercedes’ seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton was a distant third, after starting eighth, to complete the podium for the third race in a row.
“Oh my God. I was scared. I was really scared,” said a relieved Leclerc over the radio after taking the chequered flag at the Red Bull Ring with Verstappen in his mirrors and one and half seconds behind.
He overtook the Dutch driver three times on track in the race but, after two engine failures in the previous five, feared the win might still slip through his fingers as he battled a throttle problem over the last few laps.
SAINZ OUT IN FLAMES
Leclerc’s Spanish team-mate Carlos Sainz, a first time winner at Silverstone last weekend,had already retired with a fiery engine failure.
Flames erupted from the rear of the car as he pulled off with 14 laps to go while chasing a likely Ferrari one-two. Sainz tried to scramble clear but the car began rolling backwards before a marshal stopped it and extinguished the fire.
Championship leaders Red Bull also suffered a retirement with Verstappen’s team-mate Sergio Perez, second overall going into the race, damaging his car in a first lap collision with Mercedes’ George Russell and stopping on lap 26.
Russell ended up fourth despite a five-second penalty for causing the collision.
The win was Leclerc’s third of the season, fifth of his career and first since Australia in April as well as the first time he was won from anywhere other than pole position.
For Ferrari it was the second in a row, after a run of six successive Red Bull wins, and first in Austria since Michael Schumacher in 2003.
The Italian team are now 56 points behind Red Bull.
Verstappen had been chasing his fourth Austrian GP win in five years, with his Orange Army out in their tens of thousands to cheer him on. Organisers put the weekend attendance at 303,000.
“Unfortunately I couldn’t give them a win today but second place is still a good result,” he said.
SCHUMACHER SCORES AGAIN
Alpine’s Esteban Ocon was fifth, ahead of Mick Schumacher — who scored the first Formula One points of his career at Silverstone last weekend — in sixth for Haas. The German was voted driver of the day.
Lando Norris finished seventh for McLaren ahead of Haas’s Kevin Magnussen and McLaren’s Daniel Ricciardo with Alpine’s Fernando Alonso taking the final point after starting last on the grid.
The starting grid was set by the sprint, the second of the season, won by Verstappen from pole position with Leclerc second. The top eight in that race took points.
Verstappen led from the start on Sunday, with Leclerc in close pursuit as Perez and Russell tangled with the Mexican spinning into the gravel.
Leclerc passed the Red Bull on lap 12, diving down the inside of turn four, with Sainz moving up to second after Verstappen then pitted and came back out in eighth. The lead changed hands again through the pitstops before Leclerc, who had pitted and was on fresher tyres, passed Verstappen for the third time on lap 53.
Sainz’s engine failure then triggered a virtual safety car and set up a nail-biting finish.
