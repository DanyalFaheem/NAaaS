While it was a good news for Pakistan Railways’ passengers on the first day of Eid on Sunday, July 10, to see train schedules normalising after three days of utter chaos when heavy rain water current had washed away gravel from under a portion of the tracks between Jhimpir and Meting, their happiness was short-lived.
On Sunday, Pakistan Railways brought things under control when they adjusted all the passengers of Karakoram Express, Pak Business Express, Karachi Express and Shah Hussain Express on the other trains departing on that very day.
But then, heavier rains arrived on Monday, July 11, and everything fell apart once again. The trains again fell behind schedule. Pakistan Express to depart from Karachi at 1pm that day was one hour and 45 minutes late just like Allama Iqbal Express that was to leave at 2pm. Meanwhile, the Karakoram Express that was to leave at 3:30pm, left at 9:30pm instead. Tezgaam, to leave at 5:30pm, was six hours late. It left at 10:30pm and Karachi Express, to leave at 4:30pm, left at 8:20pm.
Things could not improve even on Tuesday, the third day of Eid, when Pakistan Express, to leave at 1pm, had to be rescheduled for a 9pm departure, Allama Iqbal Express, to leave at 2pm, was rescheduled for 11pm and Tezgaam, to leave at 5:30pm was rescheduled for 1:30am Wednesday.

1,Karachi's DHA residents left at mercy of rains witness replay of 2020 disaster,"“Due to Eidul Azha, I had placed a fresh water tanker. Now the tank is filled with sewage,” says a resident.","KARACHI: Scenes of August 27, 2020, replayed in real time for the residents of Cantonment Board Clifton on Sunday night. Heavy rainfall led to complete chaos in the areas that fall under the jurisdiction of the municipality.
For days, the weather forecast predicted heavy showers, and eventually the cloud burst happened. The rain was so intense that the drains were unable to handle the run-off and overflowed within two hours.
“We thought things would be different from 2020 and the area wouldn’t flood. The rain started at around 9pm on Eidul Azha, and by midnight the lanes were inundated. We woke up and saw water making its way into our home,” said Mr Saeed, a resident of Phase 6.
“Due to Eidul Azha, I had placed a fresh water tanker. Now the tank is filled with sewage,” he says.
Shamsa Jabeen, a resident of Phase 4, DHA, said the situation was pretty bad in her area. “We have no electricity since 10pm, July 10. The underground tank is filled with filthy water. After the 2020 protests, we thought things would be different.

Heavy rainfall wreaks havoc on affluent neighbourhood

“Why does it happen each and every time and that too in Phase 4? It’s getting worse and I am dreading the next spell of rainfall,” she added.
The worst affected CBC areas included Phase 4 and 6 in DHA, along with Gizri, Punjab Colony, Dehli Colony, and P&T Colony.
Ahmed Mujtaba Thanvi, who runs the Voice of DHA facebook page, says this time to the social media platform was filled with requests from citizens who were stranded in their homes and needed assistance.
The VoD page has over 45,000 members and includes official representation from K-Electric, Sindh Police, CBC, political representatives.
“This year, we saw a family from Askari reach out for help. The lady had gone into labour and the water was so high that ambulance couldn’t make it. A VoD member moved the lady and her family to Ziauddin Hospital,” says Thanvi.
Given the almost non-existent presence of rescue services and roads that looked like canals, altruistic citizens with 4x4 vehicles helped move sick and elderly to safer spots — usually homes of family members located in other areas. “Approximately 100 people were rescued in the last two days. Apart from that we sent supplies including medicines, water and diapers to families stuck in their homes.”
Officially destructed
The residents of CBC thought things would change after the 2020 protest. Unfortunately, nothing materialised except lengthy court battles for 22 individuals who were at the forefront.
Yasir Mapara, a resident of Phase 6, was one of the protesters at the CBC-DHA protests in 2020. “Nothing changed in the last two years. We were called in for meetings and they explained they are doing a lot for the drainage. We had a meeting with the station commander and an impressive presentation was given to us.”
Mr Mapara was one of the 22 individuals against whom FIR was lodged by the CBC. Charges against him and the other individuals included raising slogans against state institutions, trespassing into CBC premises, terrorising government staff and halting relief work.
“CBC told us they will look into the FIR and do something. They never revoked the FIR and the case went for a year.
“At a recent dinner at the VoD dinner, I asked them what they are doing. I had asked Watto to resign and they didn’t like it. They don’t want to do anything. They are growing petunias on Seaview.”
“Everything is destroyed and they show up with water pumps. They want an actual thank you messages. This is not how you run. The authorities concerned need to sit with proper civil engineers and sort things out.”
“They will not do anything. There are a lot of egos at work. They run away from accountability,” he says.
In a statement to the media, CBC spokesman said, “The Cantonment Board Clifton is working on drainage in rain-affected areas. There are currently 1,500 sewage treatment workers in different areas of Clifton and DHA. More than 230 small pumps and 18 heavy pumps continue to discharge rainwater. 18 Watersheds are also available in different areas for drainage of rainwater.”
While there is a lot of noise that is heard and amplified by the media when it comes to the posh areas of DHA, the commercial areas and colonies under CBC remain underreported.
From the tailors and cloth merchants to the neighbourhood kiryana stores and bun kebab sellers, all bear the brunt of rainfall and the apathy of the authorities. The families living in these areas spend days without electricity and water supplies stuck in their homes.
“Business is slow these days. Amid this inflation and rising fuel prices, the last thing I needed to see was my parlour flooded,” says Naziha, the owner of a beauty salon in lower Gizri.
Rehan Bandukda, president of PTI CBC Town Tanzeem Gizri and former general manager of the World Memon Foundation said: “It’s the same story each year. We have set up expensive pumping machines and allocated extra cleaning staff, but CBC fails to understand that the need of the hour is a proper sewerage/water drain system which can handle a 100mm downpour.
“Till that engineering common sense enters their bureaucratic, full of self-importance brains, there is nothing dif ferent we can expect,” he says.
While PTI and local philanthropists attempted to direct rescue efforts, the situation on the ground was distressing, according to Bandukda.
“The pump operators were actually selling the diesel that had been allocated to the residents for generators. Within a couple of hours, all the pumps were out of fuel and the area was flooded,” he says.

2,Magistrate releases eight teenage boys held for selling offal in Karachi,"Lawyer says boys were actually helping the citizens stranded in rainwater, but police falsely claimed they were selling offal.","KARACHI: A court on Tuesday released eight teenage boys held for allegedly selling offal of sacrificial animals in an Orangi Town area.
The Orangi Town police booked and arrested the eight suspects, including Kamran, Laraib, Moiz, Muhammad Sohail, Naseeb, Safdar, Hussain for their alleged involvement in selling offal of sacrificial animals on the Main Qadhafi Town Road, hindering vehicular movement on the busy artery during heavy rains.
On Tuesday, the investigating officer produced the suspects before Judicial Magistrate (West) Sheraz M Shaikh to seek their physical remand in police custody for interrogation.
Defence counsel Liaquat Ali Gabol submitted that his clients were in fact helping the citizens stranded in rainwater accumulated on roads, but the police falsely claimed they were selling offal, etc, and took them into custody on refusal to pay them a bribe.
The counsel argued that all of them, aged between 16 and 18 years, were residents of a same area and they were voluntarily regulating traffic in the worst post-rain condition.
The magistrate, who was performing special duty during Eid holidays, discharged all the suspects from the case and ordered their immediate release if their custody was not required in any other case.
A case was registered against them under Section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Orangi Town police station.

Area SHO Shakir Husain said that two armed men entered a house in Saeedabad-8 near the football ground, opened fire at Saima, 34, and her husband, Amjad Akbar, 38, and fled from the crime scene. 
Hearing gunshots, area people reached the scene and informed the police of the incident. The bodies were shifted to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for a post-mortem examination.
The police said that Amjad along with his wife and four children returned from his native place in Faisalabad recently and started living near Babri Masjid in Baldia-8. He was doing welding work at a local junk market. 
The couple’s minor girl was present at the time of the incident while their three other children were playing outside. 
The area SHO said investigators were focusing on two possible aspects of the double murder. Firstly, it was their free-will marriage, and beside that, there were reports that the couple also had some property disputes with their relatives. The deceased had four children.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said the young couple sustained bullet wounds in the chest and died on the spot.

4,Karachi littered with animal remains on Eid days,Outbreak of diseases feared if filth not removed forthwith..,"KARACHI: While authorities claimed to have lifted and transported over 80 per cent offal to landfill sites during the three days of Eidul Azha, several parts of the metropolis were on Tuesday still littered with the animal remains.
The worst-hit localities include Liaquatabad, Gulberg, Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, New Karachi, Baldia Town, Malir, Landhi, Korangi, etc where congested lanes and accumulated rainwater played havoc with the offal and animal remains.
In some localities, people also threw offal in ponds and puddles created by the heavy rains that lashed almost every part of the city.
The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) had set up as many as 88 collection points across the city for disposal of offal.

Outbreak of diseases feared if filth not removed forthwith

Muhammad Kashif, a resident of Block 7-D-3 of the North Karachi, said that there were piles of offal in the neighbourhood and he did not see any vehicle lifting offal that had made the entire locality stinking. 
“There is a possibility of outbreak of diseases if this filth is not removed immediately,” he apprehended.
Aizaz Alam, a resident of Block-13 of Gulistan-i-Jauhar, said that offal was remarkably removed from main streets in the vicinity time to time, but people kept on throwing animal remains in the area adding to the filth.
Residents of Baldia Town and Ittehad Town said that the process of lifting of offal was very slow as the animal remains still littered their vicinity leading to unbearable stink.
The situation of cleanliness in city’s shantytowns and localities of low-income households also remained unsatisfactory as people complained that the garbage disposal staff was too slow in their performance.
Officials said that cleanliness operation in low-lying areas was hampered due to accumulated rainwater.
People in several localities of Malir, Landhi and Korangi also complained that offal remained lying on the streets and desolated places in their areas for hours.
A resident of Malir Khokrapar, Syed Qamar Abbas, said that people removed offal from the lanes and streets in the area themselves and shifted them to an unofficial garbage den. “We are waiting the authorities to shift the animal remains to landfill site,” he added.
The situation in the salubrious parts of the city, such as Defence Housing Authority (DHA) and Clifton, was far better despite flooding of the streets. 
However, a resident of Block-5 of Clifton said that floating head of a sacrificial cow entered her house.
SSWMB Managing Director Zubair Channa told Dawn that over 63,000 tonnes of garbage that included 60 per cent offal and animal remain were lifted across the city during the three days of Eid and shifted to the landfill sites by the garbage contracting firms. 
“Over 90pc offal and animal remains have been removed from the city,” he said, adding that over 80,000 tonnes of garbage would be lifted from the city by Wednesday (today).
Around 7,200 small vehicles including Suzuki pickups and Qingqi rickshaws with over 14,000 workers of the contracting firms were used by the SSWMB in the lifting of offal in seven districts of the city.
Besides, they said, around 1,000 dumpers were used to shift the garbage and offal to the landfill sites during the past three days.
Meanwhile, Chief Secretary Dr Sohail Rajput visited the command and control cell of the SSWMB where he was briefed about the lifting of offal from the city and its subsequent shifting to different landfill sites.

5,Opposition parties in Sindh unanimously blame PPP for rain havoc,Murad says record rains coupled with high tide at sea caused urban flooding.,"KARACHI: The Sindh government came under heavy criticism on Tuesday when the political parties raised serious questions on the government’s multi-billion rupee spending to meet monsoon challenges and asked the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) administration to make the audit of all these accounts public while accusing it of focusing more on ‘ethnic based’ policies instead serving the people of Karachi where the party had been enjoying tight grip on all civic and municipal authorities and bodies for the past more than 14 years. 
The parties with different backgrounds ideologies and political agendas were found in agreement in their separate reactions to the devastation witnessed in the city during the rains and alleged that the PPP government wasn’t only ‘failed’ but “it is the most incompetent and corrupt administration” in the history of Pakistan, which never learnt from its experiences and hardly ever cared about the miseries of people in Karachi. 
MQM-P blames PPP for ethnic-based recruitments
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), which had signed a Charter of Rights with the ruling PPP over three months ago, threatened to sever all ties with the provincial government of PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in the Centre after it found that ‘nothing’ was improving when it came to rights of Karachi. 
Former Karachi mayor and senior MQM-P leader Wasim Akhtar said that the recent devastation of Karachi was the result of the PPP’s ethnic-based recruitments even at grassroots level. 

Murad says record rains coupled with high tide at sea caused urban flooding

“The people who were appointed on fake domiciles and were supposed to serve Karachi during these testing times, have left the city to enjoy Eid holidays in hometowns and villages,” he said. 
“The people of Karachi have lost billions of rupees. Their homes, cars and properties all have washed away in this rain. Enough is enough. We can’t tolerate or wait anymore. If the federal and provincial governments still cannot take our demands seriously, we would be free to decide our political future,” he said.
PTI seeks FIRs against ministers 
Holding the Sindh government responsible for the city’s situation following the rains, former Sindh governor and senior PTI leader Imran Ismail said that FIRs of all those killed during the rains should be registered against Sindh ministers and senior officials. 
Addressing a press conference, he said it was because of the government’s failure that the people had to leave their homes and move their families to safe locations. He asked why the chief minister was not devolving powers to the district level in line with 18th Amendment to the Constitution. 
Mr Ismail said that the PPP government in Sindh had divided Karachi into seven parts to get political benefits. He said that the CM had been claiming that he had developed Karachi far better than it used to be a decade ago. 
He said whenever the previous federal government of PTI tried to fix things, the PPP protested against the ‘so-called intervention’ by the federal government in Karachi calling it an insult to its mandate despite the fact that the PPP had been insulting the mandate of the people of Karachi for a long time.  
Downpour exposes PPP’s performance: JI 
Talking to journalists during reviewing rain-related activities of Al-Khidmat Foundation, Jamaat-i-Islami Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said that every year downpour exposed the performance of the provincial and city administrations but wondered despite this “absolute failure”, the PPP was ruling the province for the past 14 years. 
“There are 64 medium-sized rain drains in Karachi, besides five big drains and hundreds of arteries,” he said. “The last budget shows an allocation of Rs1.20 billion for cleaning of these drains. Well before the rains, we brought this situation before the public through media that these drains were full of filth. I would like city administrator Murtaza Wahab to explain how much funds have been utilised to clean the drains. If you combine the failure, corruption and incompetence, you can name it PPP.” 
He also questioned the Defence Housing Authority (DHA), Cantonment Boards and federal agencies operating in the city for their “incompetence” despite generating billions of rupees from Karachi. 
Unfortunately, he said, the political arena of Karachi was seen as a ground to accumulate resources, power and conquer the city while no political party and civic agency was actually ready to own the city. 
PSP sees ruling elite behind destruction
Pak Sarzameen Party chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal said that Pakistani rulers were totally indifferent towards the plight of the people, and that he had nothing to demand from the ruling elite and ‘movers and shakers’ of the state, since they were “not going to change themselves”. 
Speaking at a press conference, he said: “I ask the people to stop pinning their hopes on the rulers. The last year budget of Sindh shows the total revenue of Rs1,400 billion. According to this calculation, the share of Karachi should be Rs300 billion, but it is hardly given only Rs38 billion and they too fell prey to bribery and corruption.” 
The only feasible and permanent solution to save and run Pakistan, he believed, lied in the three constitutional amendments already presented by the PSP. The departments of local government should be incorporated in the Constitution the same way as the details of the powers of the Prime Minister and the Chief Ministers are written in the Constitution, he added. 
“Like NFC award, PFC award should be included in the constitution. National and provincial assemblies cannot come into being unless there are elected local governments in the country,” he added. 
Murad defends govt performance
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that the city had witnessed an unprecedented rainfall of 136mm or five inches of rains within 12 hours (8pm to 8am on Sunday-Monday) and then after a little break it started again till 11am. 
“Our storm water disposal system is not designed for such a heavy downpour; therefore, the system could not cater to the situation and top of it the Arabian Sea was in a state of high tide, therefore our storm water drains could not discharge the accumulated rainwater into it,” he said on Monday while talking to media at CM House after visiting different areas of the city. 
The CM said he had assigned rain emergency duties to his cabinet members in different districts of the city.  “My ministers/advisers and special assistants are on the roads, but it was so heavy downpour (of 136 mm or five inches) that our storm water system could not cater to such a huge urban flooding.” 
Mr Shah said that he had visited different areas of the city and saw civic agencies busy in disposing of the accumulated water from roads.

KARACHI: Apart from being the study of past events, history allows us to think about course correction. Since most artists prefer imagination to reason (read: heart to mind) when it comes to examining historical periods, they tend to look at things through a creative lens where ‘what-if’ take centre-stage and ‘what-happened’ takes a back seat. 
This appears to be the idea of an exhibition of artworks by renowned artist Ahmed Ali Manganhar titled Taxila Revisited that’s under way at the Canvas Art Gallery. 
Taxila is an ancient city in Punjab, one of those remarkable regions that tell us about our link to old civilisations and empires. History buffs often visit it. Manganhar seems to have a profound interest in the place, too. 
He says, “My visit to Taxila began because I wanted to step outside of the studio and thought of finding a quiet place outdoors where I could make studies from nature… I visited the colonial museum and worked with photographs from British archives. But photographs are staged and dead pictures did not work for me. So I worked them out of time and set them in the landscape of wintry Taxila, the deliberations of British archaeologists being addressed by Alexander on his charging horse, among monks and statues from other times. To me, history painting is not about facts, ideas or even interpretation. It could be about many images that historians of power have left behind.” 
Some key takeaways from the artist’s assertion are the images left behind, wintry Taxila and Alexander. It is evident that he is revisiting an epoch by re-visualising it. The visual and the tactile are evoked beautifully in his paintings with a distinction that while going back in time he is also trying to look at things not through a historian’s lens but with a collective perspective which could come either from people of the days gone by or the present. 
‘Greek Myth: Narcissus’ (acrylic on canvas) is an impressive case in point. Another striking example is the series ‘Alexandrian Dreams’. These dreams do not give off a power vibe. Rather they speak of the kind of individuality that is steeped in the collective progress of a civilisation. 
The exhibition concludes on Thursday (tomorrow).

7,Karachi’s monsoon stories — lesson to be learnt for govt,Biggest challenge that the authorities face is to become desensitised to people’s pain — if that hasn’t happened already.,"KARACHI: Spare a thought for those who live in hutments in Karachi. Think about those who, even on the second day of Eidul Azha, had to walk or ride a motorbike or catch a public transport bus (not the new fancy ones) all the way from their homes to their workplace because they needed to put food on the table. Remember those, at least for a couple of minutes, who were down with Covid, isolating themselves in one corner of their house without electricity in humid conditions. And then talk about what percentage of the city is controlled by cantonment boards, how much responsibility the Sindh government need to shoulder and what the rest of the administrative units must take blame for... This is absurd. It is the most inconsiderate way of trivialising suffering.   
What was witnessed and experienced on Monday by Karachiites in the form of 119.5mm rainfall was nothing new. It happens every year. Nor the ‘who’s responsible’ game on social and mainstream media is a new occurrence. The fact that half a dozen people lost their lives (five were electrocuted and one couldn’t bear the force which a wall collapsed) is just another newsflash. Debate as much as you like as to what can be or can’t be done when it’s coming down buckets, the biggest challenge that the authorities face is to become desensitised to people’s pain — if that hasn’t happened already. 
Only on Monday, a number of stories unfolded that signify how important it is for those who hold the city’s reins to not to let people down. These are extremely toilsome times in terms of the economic difficulties faced by the country and the climactic situation that exists in Sindh. That said, it’s the people who don’t allow hope to dwindle. 
On Monday, while I tried to walk from Teen Talwar underpass across to Dellawala Market to get some nibbles at 8:30am, the torrential rains made me stop in a sheltered corner of the old Agha Super Market facing the bridge. There I saw a security guard, in his late fifties or early sixties, sitting in a chair. There was another (vacant) chair in front of him in which I decided to sit for a while until the rain relented a bit and my clothes dried off. The guard, an extremely amiable man, allowed me to sit alongside him with a smile. As I struck up a conversation with him, the following came to the fore: his name is Abdul Razzaq who originally hails from Dadu, Sindh; lives in Gizri with his wife and four children, three boys and a girl. 
When I asked why he had to come to work in spite of the inclement weather because it’d been raining for the last seven or eight hours, he replied he’s the bread winner of the family and couldn’t afford to miss a single day. For that he had come to Clifton from Gizri on foot and had to put on another set of uniform because the one that he wore when he left home was completely soaked.  
Twenty minutes or so into the chitchat a rickshaw pulled up near us. The driver, a septuagenarian, requested Abdul Razzaq to look after his vehicle up until a little after midday as he needed to catch a bus to reach Chamra Chowk where he worked as the supervisor at a company. (He drove the auto-rickshaw part-time.) Again, when I said to the old man he could’ve taken the day off (after all, it was Eid day) his response was similar to Abdul Razzaq’s: inflation was high and he couldn’t risk missing work. The guard happily agreed to look after the rickshaw and the septuagenarian trudged his way to the bus station.  
The perseverance and dedication to their respective jobs of both gentlemen is exemplary. These are just two stories. There would be many who on that fateful day when the city was totally paralysed tried to fulfil obligation. Perhaps there’s a lesson to be learnt here for government functionaries. As an Urdu verse goes: 
Shikwa-i-zulmat-i-shab se to kahin behter tha
Apney hissey ki koi shamma jalate jaate 
[Instead of grousing about the tyranny of the dark night
You could’ve lit a candle that you were supposed to light]

The chief minister was told that the underpasses of district South and East had been cleared of rainwater and they would be opened for traffic by the evening.
The chief minister directed the local government department to get small pumps installed at the streets where rainwater was still accumulated and clear them. 
“A forecast for another spell of heavy rain has been issued; therefore we have to get ready for it,” he said.
Meanwhile, the CM directed the city police chief to ensure smooth flow of vehicular traffic on roads.
Mr Shah directed the local government department to start patchwork of the roads damaged by heavy rain.

9,Hindus protest girl’s ‘abduction’ in front of Zardari House in Nawabshah,"Police claim girl not abducted but eloped and contracted marriage with Muslim boy; FIR registered against boy, father.","DADU: Members of Hindu community marched on main roads before staging a protest in front of Zardari House in Nawabshah on Tuesday in protest against what they believed was abduction of a community girl. 
Police claimed Shrimati Kareena had eloped with a Muslim boy for love and had contacted marriage with him in a Karachi court.
The protesters chanted slogans against police and demanded former president Asif Ali Zardari intervene to help them recover the girl, who was allegedly kidnapped in Unnar Muhalla, Qazi Ahmed town, six days ago.
But Nawabshah SSP Ameer Saud Magsi said that Shrimati Kareena had not been abducted she had eloped with Khalil Rehman Jono of Meer Mohammad Jono village and had married to him in a court in Karachi. 
He said that Asghar Jono, father of Khalil, had been arrested after registration of FIR under Section 365-B on a complaint lodged by Sundurmal. Khalil and his father Asghar were nominated in FIR, he said.
The SSP shared a nikahnama purportedly of Shrimati Kareena and Khalil Rehman Jono and said the girl would be produced in Sindh High Court. The girl would decide to go wherever she wanted, he said.
Hindu Panchayat vice president Lajpat Rai rejected the SSP’s claim and said that police had registered an FIR but were rescuing the abducted girl. A delegation of Hindu community met the SSP but he had not helped them, he said.
Manomal, another Panchayat leader, said that the abducted girl was under pressure to change religion and was not being produced in any court.
He appealed to Asif Ali Zardari to help the Hindu community in the recovery of the girl. When the protestors reached close to Zardari House, police stopped them from advancing to the former president’s residence and persuade them to end the protest over assurance the girl would be produced in court.

He was speaking to newly-elected candidates of local government and PPP workers at Zardari House in Nawabshah on Tuesday evening.

Muslim world urged to raise voice for Kashmiris
Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has said Kashmiri people are facing unprecedented oppression, tyranny and barbarism and they are in dire need of diplomatic help at the time.
Congratulating Muslims around the world on the occasion of Eidul Azha, he said that Muslims of India-held Kashmir should be especially remembered on the occasion of Eid. All Muslims must remember them in their prayers, he said. 
He said that Kashmiris were in dire need of diplomatic help at this time. Muslims around the world should raise their voice in support of their oppressed brethern and sisters, he said.

Later, he arrived at his ancestral graveyard Baloo Ja Quba where he offered fateha and laid wreaths on the graves of his father Hakim Ali Zardari and other family members.
PPP local leaders Mir Nadir Magsi, Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, Ali Hassan Zardari, Ashiq Ali Zardari and others were also present on the occasion.

Murtaza Wahab is making concerted efforts to drain out rainwater from the metropolis but media is only focused on flooded roads and streets in Karachi, although it should also show government’s measures for drainage, he said.
Shah told media persons at his native village, Wahur, in Sehwan taluka on Eid day that the Sindh government had made complete arrangements to cope with post-rain situation in Karachi and other parts of the province.
He said that a provincial minister had been made in-charge in each district across the province to oversee arrangements for coping with rain. The deaths of miners in Thatta during heavy rain were unfortunate and the government was investigating the tragic incident, he said.
About by-election in Punjab, Shah said that political atmosphere had become hot in the province and allegations were being hurled at each other. PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry had himself admitted that they did something wrong, hence something should be done about it, he said. 
He said that the country needed to be rebuilt. Former prime minister Imran Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had no future. What had the former prime minister done for the country, he asked.
He said that Imran Khan came to power after making tall claims but he did nothing for the country. “We are aware of inflation and know people are burdened by it,” he said.

12,Man’s death in hotel brawl draws angry reaction from nationalists,HYDERABAD: A 35-year-old man was killed and five of his colleagues were injured in a scuffle at a hotel near Wadhu...,"HYDERABAD: A 35-year-old man was killed and five of his colleagues were injured in a scuffle at a hotel near Wadhu Wah in Nasim Nagar early on Tuesday morning, drawing angry reaction from nationalist parties who believed the attackers were Afghans nationals.
Police arrested the hotel owner while Hyderabad senior superintendent of police (SSP) Amjad Ahmed Sheikh suspended over half a dozen policemen for failing to avert the incident. 
The incident took place at Super Salateen hotel off Hyderabad bypass near Wadhu Wah where deceased Bilal Kaka and his four friends had gone to have food at around 2:30am. 
According to FIR of the incident, late Bilal’s brother Salam Kaka said quoting his friends Sarfaraz Sanjrani, Imran Khan, Zeeshan Jamali and Waqar Patoli who were with him at the hotel that they were having food when waiter misbehaved with them. When they complained to the hotel owner about his attitude the owner Haji Shah Sawar rudely asked them to leave.
Immediately afterwards, the owner called his friends who came armed with pointed iron rods and attacked Bilal on his head. When people gathered there the attackers resorted to aerial firing to disperse them and fled away when they felt Bilal had died, he said.
SSP Amjad Ahmed Sheikh said while talking to protesters who had blocked a section of Hyderabad bypass in front of the restaurant on Tuesday morning, demanding registration of FIR, that police were verifying whether the owner was Afghan national. The FIR had been lodged and the hotel owner had been arrested while other accused too would be brought to justice soon.
He confirmed that policemen of Bhitai Nagar and Nasim Nagar had been suspended for their inaction and ‘cowardice’ as they did not intervene when the incident happened. 
According to an unverified account of the incident, the scuffle had started over payment of bill and soon turned violent. 
Dr Niaz Kalani of Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz, Punhal Sario and others had led the protest.
Nationalists slam incident
The incident caused an outcry among nationalist circles who believed the hotel owner was an Afghan national. They quickly linked the incident to the issue of influx of outsiders in Sindh.
Sindh United Party chairman Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah said that lawlessness was increasing with each passing day thanks to Afghan settlers and influx of outsiders in Sindh. 
In a statement issued here Tuesday, he said that his party had been raising voice over this issue and demanding repatriation of outsiders to their countries but state institutions were not showing seriousness and their actions were rather making them more powerful. 
He urged activists of Sindh national movement to stay away from Sindhi-Pathan ethnic strife but they should not give any property for business or residence to Afghan nationals.
Sindh Taraqqi-pasand Party chairman Dr Qadir Magsi said that influx of outsiders had increased lawlessness in Sindh.
Talking to different delegations at his party office on Tuesday, he said that the murder of Bilal Kaka was a case in point. PPP government was signing agreements with outsiders only for the sake of its power in Sindh and the party was accepting their unconstitutional and illegal demands, he said. 
Awami Jamhoori Party president Syed Lal Shah, general secretary Khadim Talpur and others also condemned the incident and demanded arrest of the attackers. 
They said that the police officials who allowed the attackers to flee from the area should also be taken to task.

14,"Hyderabad to get BRT soon, says Sharjeel",HYDERABAD: Sindh Minister for Information Sharjeel Inam Memon has said that Hyderabad will also get a project on the...,"HYDERABAD: Sindh Minister for Information Sharjeel Inam Memon has said that Hyderabad will also get a project on the pattern of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) which will not only improve the city’s infrastructure but also provide better transport facilities to masses.
He said that all require measures would be taken to hold the second phase of local government election in a peaceful and transparent manner. So far 30 chairmen and vice chairmen of Pakistan Peoples Party had been elected unopposed in the district, he said. 
The question of rigging simply did not arise because the opponent parties could not even find any candidate to field against PPP in the LG polls, he said while speaking to journalists after offering Eidul Azha prayers at his residence in Tandojam. 
He urged all political forces to end their mutual differences and work for progress of the country. Political differences should not be taken to a point where they undermine even personal relations. PPP was ready to talk to all political parties but Imran Khan had closed doors of talks with all other political forces, he said. 
He said that on the directives of PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari, Sindh government was planning to provide relief to the poor in order to enable them to cope with unprecedented price hike. Its announcement would be made soon by the chief minister, he said.
He said that the Sindh government had formed teams headed by provincial ministers and elected representatives to supervise rain emergency and related measures. Civic agencies with the help of provincial government’s machinery were busy draining out stagnant rainwater in the rain-hit districts of Sindh, he said.
Memon said that PPP would fulfill all the promises made with its ally, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pak­istan, and added that three names were forwarded to the president for Sindh’s gubernatorial post but unfortunately the presidency that was remotely controlled from Banigala had delayed the appointment. 
He said that the political party winning majority of seats would get its mayor elected in Hyderabad. Delimitations were carried out by Election Commission of Pakistan along with revenue officers and Sindh government had nothing to do with it, he said.
He said that the former prime minister had promoted a culture of vitriolic and abuses. The leaked audio purportedly linked to former first lady raised serious questions over her neutrality and the impression that she was just housewife and apolitical but the video told another story, he said.
