0,US Capitol riot probe examines Trump circle’s ties to extremists,"Hearing focuses on Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, two groups that investigators say helped plan attack on Capitol, QAnon.","WASHINGTON: The congressional committee investigating the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol sought to draw connections on Tuesday between then-president Donald Trump’s closest allies and right-wing militants who stormed the seat of government in a bid to keep him in power.
The House of Representatives committee’s seventh hearing in five weeks was to focus on the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, two pro-Trump groups that investigators say helped plan the attack, as well as QAnon, a right-wing conspiracy theory movement.
The hearing was to explore ties between the two groups and Trump associates including Roger Stone and Mike Flynn, according to a committee aide.
The Oath Keepers provided security to Stone, a self-described  “dirty trickster” who has advised Trump off and on for decades, in Washington on Jan 5 and 6 Flynn, a retired Army general, served as Trump’s first national security adviser.
The committee’s seven Democrats and two Republicans have used the hearings to build a case that Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat in the November 2020 election constitute illegal conduct, far beyond normal politics.
Committee members say Trump incited the riot through his refusal to admit he lost the 2020 presidential election and through comments like his Dec 19, 2020, call on Twitter for supporters to flock to Washington for a  “big protest,” saying,  “Be there, will be wild.” 
They also have questioned the role of some members of Congress in Trump’s Republican Party. Committee aides said Tuesday’s hearing would explore the involvement of some lawmakers.
The hearing is expected to feature video testimony from Pat Cipollone, Trump’s former White House counsel, who spoke to committee investigators behind closed doors on Friday.
The attack on the Capitol, following a speech Trump gave at a rally outside the White House, delayed certification of Joe Biden’s election for hours, injured more than 140 police officers and led to several deaths.
In response to a request for comment, Stone said he was facing the  “tactic of guilt by association.”  In an email, he said,  “Any assertion that I knew in advance about, was involved in or condoned any of the illegal actions at the Capitol is false. Any claim that I knew from any member of the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers about any plan for illegal activities on January 6th is also false.”  An attorney for Flynn did not respond to a request for comment.
Neither Flynn nor Stone has been charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol and both have invoked their Fifth Amendment constitutional right against self-incrimination before the Jan. 6 committee. Trump pardoned both after they were convicted or pleaded guilty in cases unrelated to the Capitol attack.
The Oath Keepers and Proud Boys gained national attention during the Trump administration for their support of the Republican president. Trump urged the Proud Boys to  “stand back and stand by” during a September 2020 debate as he campaigned against Biden.
About 800 people, including members of both groups, have been charged with taking part in the Capitol riot, with about 250 guilty pleas so far. Questioning of witnesses during the hearing will be led by Democratic Representatives Stephanie Murphy and Jamie Raskin.
Trump, who has hinted he may seek the White House again in 2024, denies wrongdoing and has falsely asserted that he lost only because of widespread fraud that benefited Biden.
Trump and his supporters — including many Republicans in Congress — dismiss the Jan. 6 panel as a political witch hunt, but the panel’s backers say it is a necessary probe into a violent threat against democracy.

1,"US drone strike kills IS Syria chief, says Pentagon",WASHINGTON: A man who US officials called the leader of the militant Islamic State group in Syria was killed on...,"WASHINGTON: A man who US officials called the leader of the militant Islamic State group in Syria was killed on Tuesday in a drone strike, the Pentagon said.
Maher al-Agal was killed while riding a motorcycle near Jindires in northern Syria, and one of his top aides was seriously injured, Pentagon Central Command spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Dave Eastburn said.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed Agal was killed in a drone strike. The volunteer Syrian Civil Defence Force, known as the  “White Helmets,” said one person was killed and another injured in a strike that targeted a motorcycle outside Aleppo, but did not identify the victims.
There was little information available about Agal, whom the Observatory called the IS governor for the Levant. The US Central Command called him  “one of the top five” leaders of IS overall.
“In addition to being a senior leader within the group, Al-Agal was responsible for aggressively pursuing the development of IS networks outside of Iraq and Syria,” it said in a statement.
According to a spokesman for the US-allied Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, both the men who were targeted had links to Ahrar al-Sharqiya, an armed group operating in northern Syria.
The group has integrated former leaders and members of IS and other jihadist groups, and has conducted attacks against Kurdish targets inside Turkish-controlled areas of northern Syria.
Ahrar al-Sharqiya was responsible for the 2019 assassination of prominent Kurdish female politician Hevrin Khalaf, which sparked international condemnation. The US Treasury placed the group on its sanctions blacklist in July 2021.
“Ahrar al-Sharqiya has committed numerous crimes against civilians, particularly Syrian Kurds, including unlawful killings, abductions, torture, and seizures of private property,” the Treasury said at the time.
At the site of the drone strike, there were two small craters in the road and debris from the destroyed motorcycle.
Local villagers said that the two IS members did not live in the area where they were killed. Damien Ferre, founder of the consultancy Jihad Analytics, downplayed the strike, saying IS in Syria is  “barely a shadow” of what it used to be.
“They are still able to carry out attacks against Syrian government forces and undertake operations here and there against the Kurdish forces,” he said.
But the group is weak compared to the period of the IS  “caliphate” that came to control large parts of Iraq and Syria between 2011 and 2019, he said.
“It is important to remember that each time an IS head is killed, they are replaced immediately,” added Ferre.  “It really should not impact their activities.” The last two targeted killings of IS leaders took place in Turkish-controlled areas of northern Syria, where groups like Ahrar al-Sharqiya are active and have local knowledge of the terrain and families.
The strike came five months after a nighttime US raid in the town of Atme, which led to the death of the overall IS leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Qurashi. US officials said Qurashi died when he detonated a bomb to avoid capture.
“The removal of these IS leaders will disrupt the terrorist organization’s ability to further plot and carry out global attacks,” the Central Command said.

2,EU gives Croatia green light to adopt euro next year,BRUSSELS: EU finance ministers on Tuesday gave Croatia the final green light to adopt the euro single currency on ...,"BRUSSELS: EU finance ministers on Tuesday gave Croatia the final green light to adopt the euro single currency on Jan 1, 2023.
“I would like to congratulate my counterpart, Zdravko Maric, and the whole of Croatia for becoming the 20th country to join the euro area,” said Zbynek Stanjura, the finance minister of the Czech Republic, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency.
Croatia’s switch from the kuna to the euro in 2023 will come less than a decade after the former Yugoslav republic joined the European Union and will set a new milestone in the bloc’s further integration.
“This is a time for celebration... and an act of conviction,” said Christine Lagarde, the head of the European Central Bank at a signing ceremony in Brussels.
“The whole of Croatia decided and was convinced of the value of joining the euro and the euro area,” she added. In adopting the legal texts necessary for the historic move, the ministers officially set the euro at 7.53450 Croatian kuna.
The newest member joins the group at a difficult moment with the euro hovering close to parity with the US dollar, a symptom of a looming cost-of-living crisis in the eurozone economy. “We’re all facing very strong challenges these days, but obviously with coordinated policies and measures I think we can cope with these challenges,” said Maric as he arrived to meet his counterparts in Brussels.
To join the euro, Croatia met the strict conditions, including keeping inflation in the same range as its EU peers, as well as embracing sound public spending.
Croatia expressed willingness to adopt the single currency upon joining the EU in 2013, and the decision to allow Zagreb’s entry comes as the euro has just celebrated its 20th anniversary. On January 1, 2002, millions of Europeans in 12 countries gave up the lira, franc, deutsche mark and drachma for euro bills and coins.
They have since been joined by seven other countries: Slovenia in 2007, Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014 and finally Lithuania in 2015.

3,"Imports by Asia of thermal coal, LNG hold up despite record prices","India, the world’s second-biggest coal importer, behind China, saw record arrivals in June of thermal coal.","LAUNCESTON: With thermal coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices holding close to record highs in Asia, it would be logical to expect demand destruction, especially in developing nations said to be price sensitive. But it isn’t happening yet.
India, the world’s second-biggest coal importer, behind China, saw record arrivals in June of thermal coal, used mainly to generate electricity, according to data compiled by commodity analysts Kpler.
Thermal coal imports were 19.22 million tonnes in June, up 35 per cent from May’s 14.23 million and 56pc above the level of June 2021, the data showed.
India’s LNG imports also remained robust, coming in at 1.87 million tonnes, according to Kpler.
While this was down from May’s 2.15 million tonnes, it was above the 1.84 million from June last year. It’s also worth noting that May’s imports were the strongest in seven months.
India has long been assumed to be sensitive to high prices, and certainly its actions in boosting imports of highly discounted Russian crude oil in recent months have supported the assumption.
But, if anything, thermal coal and spot LNG prices have risen far more sharply than crude oil since Russia’s Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine and are trading at extreme levels compared with long-run averages.
The weekly index for benchmark Australian thermal coal at Newcastle port, as assessed by commodity price reporting agency Argus, was $410.82 a tonne for the seven days to July 8.
This was down from the record high of $425.31 a tonne in the week to May 20, but was still 194pc higher than the $138.80 at the same week in July last year, and some 755pc above the $48.07 that prevailed in July 2020.
India has been reducing the volume of thermal coal it buys from Australia but still took 1.9 million tonnes in June, although this was down from 3.39 million in the same month in 2021.
It has boosted imports of cheaper, lower-quality coal from Indonesia, with June arrivals at 14.25 million tonnes, up from 4.37 million in June 2021.
However, while this will help with the import bill, Indonesian coal is also trading at elevated levels, with fuel containing 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram assessed at $84.99 a tonne in the week to July 8.
This is down from the high so far this year of $120.86 a tonne on March 11, but is 33.6pc above the $63.59 of the same week in July last year and 263pc higher than the $23.39 of July 2020.
LNG volumes
Spot LNG prices are also still at near-record levels as concern over Russia’s natural gas supplies to Europe by pipeline continue to overshadow the market.
New York-traded futures based on the S&P Global Commodity Insights JKM benchmark ended at $38.84 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on Monday. That is down from the record high of $51.77 on March 7 but still 212pc above the $12.45 at the same time in July last year and an astonishing 1,700pc above the $2.16 of the same day in July 2020.
It’s not only India that has continued to import expensive fossil fuels, with neighbouring Pakistan seeing LNG arrivals of 750,000 tonnes in June.
This was down from May’s 770,000, but June and May were Pakistan’s strongest months for LNG imports since May 2021, and June’s figure was 15.4pc above the same month last year.
If there is a sign of high prices starting to affect demand, it’s in Pakistan’s imports of thermal coal, which dropped to 611,090 tonnes in June, according to Kpler. This is down from 1.24 million tonnes in May, and 1.48 million in June last year.
South Africa, the world’s third-largest coal exporter, has in recent years been a top supplier to Pakistan, but imports dropped to just 230,472 tonnes in June, down from 820,922 in June last year.
This most likely reflects South Africa being a swing supplier to Europe, which has boosted coal imports from countries other than Russia, which has been the top supplier to the continent.
Looking at Asia as a whole, thermal coal imports increased in June to 68.96 million tonnes from May’s 62.8 million, and were roughly in line with the 69.58 million in June last year.
LNG imports in Asia were 20.51 million tonnes in June, down slightly from May’s 21.98 million and the 21.85 million in the same month last year.
Overall, the flows data indicates that, despite high prices, demand for power generation fuels such as thermal coal and LNG is holding up, especially in countries where sharp declines may have been expected.

4,Japanese turn up in droves to  bid farewell to slain Abe,"TOKYO: With prayers, flowers and flags draped in black ribbons, Japan on Tuesday said farewell to Shinzo Abe, a...","TOKYO: With prayers, flowers and flags draped in black ribbons, Japan on Tuesday said farewell to Shinzo Abe, a polarising figure who dominated politics as the country’s longest-serving premier, before being gunned down at a campaign rally last week.
Crowds packed pavements lined with a heavy police presence as the hearse carrying Abe, who died at age 67, departed from a central Tokyo temple on a procession through the city.
With nearly a dozen helicopters circling overhead, people bowed deeply, their hands clasped in prayer, as the hearse passed in a procession carried live on broadcaster NHK. Others clapped, cheered or waved.
“Thank you very much for your work for our country,” one man repeatedly shouted.
Hundreds had filed into the temple where Abe’s funeral was held on Monday evening and Tuesday morning, prior to the private ceremony, to pay their respects. His killing on Friday by an unemployed man wielding a homemade gun stunned a nation where both gun crime and political violence are extremely rare.
The funeral procession passed through the capital’s political heart of Nagatacho, where hundreds had lined up in front of the parliament building Abe first entered as a young lawmaker in 1993, after the death of his politician father.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and a group of cabinet ministers waited quietly in front of the office from which Abe, Japan’s youngest prime minister when he first took office, led the nation for two stints, the longest from 2012 to 2020, when he resigned due to health problems.
As the hearse slowly passed, Kishida bowed his head, a set of Buddhist rosary beads around his clasped hands. Abe’s widow, Akie, bowed back from the front seat of the hearse.
China slams Taiwan over funeral trip
China  on Tuesday accused Taiwan of  “political manipulation” after its Vice  President William Lai attended former Japanese prime minister Shinzo  Abe’s funeral — Taipei’s highest-ranking official visit to Japan in  decades.“After  the former Japanese prime minister Abe Shinzo unexpectedly passed away,  Taiwan authorities seized it as an opportunity for political  manipulation,” said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin told  reporters at a routine briefing.
“Taiwan is a part of China, there  is no so-called Vice President.” The Chinese government had already  made  “representations” to Japanese officials at its embassy in Beijing  as well as in Tokyo, Wang added. Taiwanese officials remained tight-lipped about the visit, likely to avoid further antagonising Beijing.
But  Taiwanese media reported that Lai made the trip on the orders of  President Tsai Ing-wen, in what one ruling party lawmaker called a   “diplomatic breakthrough”.
While Japan does not formally recognise  Taiwan, relations between the two have warmed in recent years, with  Tokyo donating several batches of Covid vaccines to the island and  becoming more outspoken about China’s growing influence in the region.
Japanese  officials have also sought to downplay the visit, with foreign minister  Yoshimasa Hayashi saying Tuesday that Lai had attended the funeral  “as  a private individual”.
“There has been no change to our country’s  basic policy to keep our relationship with Taiwan as a  non-governmental, working relationship,” Hayashi told reporters.

5,Iran to supply Russia with UAVs for use in Ukraine: US,WASHINGTON: Iran is planning to supply hundreds of drones with combat weapon capabilities to Russia for use in...,"WASHINGTON: Iran is planning to supply hundreds of drones with combat weapon capabilities to Russia for use in Ukraine, a top US official said on Monday.  
Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said the information received by the United States supported views that the Russian military is facing challenges sustaining its weaponry after significant losses in Ukraine.  
“The Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), including weapons-capable UAVs, on an expedited timeline,” Sullivan told reporters.  
“Our information further indicates that Iran is preparing to train Russian forces to use these UAVs, with initial training sessions slated to begin as soon as early July,” he said.  
Iran responded on Tuesday by saying that “no special development” had taken place in technological cooperation with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine in February.  
Without specifically mentioning drones, Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said cooperation with Russia “in the field of some modern technologies predates the war in Ukraine, and there has been no special development in that regard recently.”  
Tehran’s position regarding the war “is quite clear and has been officially announced many times,” he added.  
Iran has maintained that it is against the war in Ukraine and called for a political solution, while blaming the roots of the crisis on the United States and Nato’s expansion.  
“The claim of the American official (Sullivan) comes as the US and the Europeans have for years turned the occupying and aggressor countries, including in the West Asia region, into a storehouse of their various deadly weapons,” Kanani added.

6,Rishi Sunak refuses to attack Boris Johnson in leadership bid,"""I will have no part in a rewriting of history that seeks to demonise Boris, exaggerate his faults or deny his efforts,"" he says.","LONDON: Former finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Tuesday his campaign to be Britain’s next prime minister would avoid any attempt to  “demonise” Boris Johnson, despite having helped trigger his dramatic downfall.
Sunak, 42, and another minister quit last week in protest at Johnson’s scandal-hit administration, setting off a wave of government resignations that forced him to step down as Conservative leader.
Johnson is staying on in Downing Street as prime minister until an internal party contest finds his successor. The result is due on Sept 5. But the main opposition Labour party said it would try to force a vote of no confidence in the government to try to get him out of office sooner.
Labour leader Keir Starmer said that by their actions last week, the Tories had  “concluded that the prime minister is unfit for office”  “They can’t now let him cling on for weeks and weeks and weeks until Sept 5,” he argued.  “It would be intolerable for the country.” The no-confidence motion is expected to be voted on by the House of Commons on Wednesday.
Sunak, who was appointed chancellor of the exchequer in early 2020 just as the Covid pandemic hit, is seen as one of the frontrunners for the Tory leadership. But he refused to distance himself from Johnson’s administration, in which he played a key role supporting businesses and workers during the pandemic.
He called Johnson  “one of the most remarkable people I’ve met”. “Whatever some commentators may say, he has a good heart,” he told cheering supporters, after one Johnson ally accused Sunak of being a treacherous  “snake”.
“But did I disagree with him? Frequently. Is he flawed? Yes, and so are the rest of us. Was it no longer working? Yes, and that’s why I resigned.
“But let me be clear, I will have no part in a rewriting of history that seeks to demonise Boris, exaggerate his faults or deny his efforts.” Johnson’s departure was a spectacular fall from grace for a politician who secured a landslide election win in December 2019 and took the country out of the European Union just a month later.
Sunak said he would not shy away from praising that or recognising Johnson’s stewardship of the fightback against Covid or his hawkish support for Ukraine.
“Some people might advise that I should avoid saying all of this in case of alienating people but that wouldn’t be honest,” he added.
“If telling you what I think — positive and negative — costs me the leadership, so be it.” So far, 10 candidates, including Sunak, his replacement at the Treasury Nadhim Zahawi and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss are vying to replace Johnson.
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps withdrew and threw his weight behind Sunak’s campaign. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab is also backing Sunak.
Home Secretary Priti Patel — who like Truss is a favourite of the Tory right — was rumoured to be about to join the fray but ruled out a bid.
After days of sniping among leading contenders, Patel expressed hope  “the contest will be conducted in a good spirit that brings our party together”.

7,Ukraine claims destroying Russian arms depot in Moscow-controlled region,Russian-backed authorities accuse Ukraine of damaging civilian infrastructure and killing at least seven people.,"KYIV: Kyiv said on Tuesday it had launched artillery barrages that a destroyed a Russian arms depot and carried out a  “special operation” to free military captives in the Moscow-controlled Kherson region.
The bombardments in the south came as Washington and the EU announced nearly $3 billion combined for Ukraine and Turkey said delegations from Moscow and Kyiv would meet in Istanbul Wednesday to discuss restarting stalled grain deliveries across the Black Sea.
Ukrainian military officials said the strikes had destroyed artillery, armoured vehicles  “and a warehouse with ammunition” in the town of Nova Kakhovka.
Russian-backed authorities accused Ukraine, however, of damaging civilian infrastructure and killing at least seven people, a toll that could not be independently verified.
“Warehouses were hit, as were shops, a pharmacy, petrol stations and even a church,” the head of the city’s Moscow-backed administration, Vladimir Leontiev, said on social media.
Ukrainian military intelligence said separately its forces had free five captives in a  “special operation” in Kherson, including a military serviceman and former police officer, without specifying when.

8,BBC report reveals UK commandos killed 54 unarmed Afghans,"Unarmed Afghan men were routinely shot dead “in cold blood” by SAS troops during night-time raids, report says.","LONDON: Commandos in Britain’s elite Special Air Service (SAS) corps killed at least 54 Afghans in suspicious circumstances but the military chain of command concealed concerns, a BBC investigation said on Tuesday.
Unarmed Afghan men were routinely shot dead “in cold blood” by SAS troops during night-time raids during the long war, and weapons were planted on them to justify the crimes, the four-year probe found.  
Senior officers, including General Mark Carleton-Smith who headed UK Special Forces at the time, were aware of concerns within the SAS about the operations but failed to report them to military police, it said.  
Under the UK law governing the armed forces, it is a criminal offence for a commanding officer to fail to inform the military police if they become aware of potential war crimes, the BBC noted.  
Carleton-Smith, who retired last month as head of the British army overall, declined to comment to the BBC programme “Panorama”, which said its investigation was based on court documents, leaked emails and its own journalists’ travel to sites of the operations in Afghanistan.  
The defence ministry said prior investigations into the conduct of UK forces in Afghanistan found insufficient evidence to bring charges.  
“No new evidence has been presented, but the service police will consider any allegations should new evidence come to light,” it said in a statement to the BBC. “The UK armed forces served with courage and professionalism in Afghanistan and we will always hold them to the highest standards.”  
The Panorama investigation, airing in full later on Tuesday, identified 54 people shot dead in suspicious circumstances by one SAS unit during one six-month tour of Helmand province from November 2010 to May 2011.  
After-action reports showed other officers were surprised at the high casualty rate being inflicted by the unit, when none of the SAS troops reported injuries in apparent firefights with the Taliban.  
“Too many people were being killed on night raids and the explanations didn’t make sense. Once somebody is detained, they shouldn’t end up dead,” one senior officer at special forces headquarters told Panorama. “For it to happen over and over again was causing alarm at HQ. It was clear at the time that something was wrong.”  
There was particular concern that SAS bullet holes found at the scene of Afghan residential compounds after the raids were all low down — indicating that suspects were kneeling or prone on the ground. Several warnings were relayed up the chain of command, the BBC said. But the SAS squadron was allowed to finish its six-month tour — and was deployed for another in 2012.  
In 2014, the Royal Military Police launched an investigation into more than 600 alleged offences by British forces in Afghanistan, including a number of killings by the SAS squadron.  
But RMP investigators told the BBC that they were “obstructed” by the British military, and the investigation ended in 2019.  
Colonel Oliver Lee, who was commander of the Royal Marines in Afghanistan in 2011, told the programme that the allegations were “incredibly shocking” and merited a full public inquiry.

9,Chinese scientists develop robot fish that gobble up microplastics,"Robots may one day help to clean up the world’s polluted oceans, say scientists.","BEIJING: Robot fish that  “eat” microplastics may one day help to clean up the world’s polluted oceans, says a team of Chinese scientists from Sichuan University in southwest China.
Soft to touch and just 1.3 centimetres (0.5 inch) in size, these robots already suck up microplastics in shallow water.
The team aims to enable them to collect microplastics in deeper water and provide information to analyse marine pollution in real time, said Wang Yuyan, one of the researchers who developed the robot.
“We developed such a lightweight miniaturised robot. It can be used in many ways, for example in biomedical or hazardous operations, such a small robot that can be localised to a part of your body to help you eliminate some disease.” 
The black robot fish is irradiated by a light, helping it to flap its fins and wiggle its body. Scientists can control the fish using the light to avoid it crashing into other fish or ships.
If it is accidentally eaten by other fish, it can be digested without harm as it is made from polyurethane, which is also biocompatible, Wang said.
The fish is able to absorb pollutants and recover itself even when it is damaged. It can swim up to 2.76 body lengths per second, faster than most artificial soft robots.
“We are mostly working on collection (of microplastics). It is like a sampling robot and it can be used repeatedly,” she said.

10,Stardust and ‘time travel’: revolutionary images from James Webb show universe in new light,Nasa has revealed 5 breath-taking new images of the early universe; scientists say pictures will change the way people see space.,"WASHINGTON: The cosmic cliffs of a stellar nursery, a quintet of galaxies bound in a celestial dance: the James Webb Space Telescope released its next wave of images on Tuesday, heralding a new era of astronomy.  
“Every image is a new discovery,” said NASA administrator Bill Nelson. “Each will give humanity a view of the universe that we’ve never seen before.” 
Released one by one, the new images demonstrated the full power of the $10 billion observatory, which uses infrared cameras to gaze into the distant universe in unprecedented clarity. 
On Monday, Webb revealed the clearest image to date of the early universe, going back 13 billion years.
The first batch of full-colour, high-resolution pictures, which took weeks to render from raw telescope data, were selected by NASA to provide compelling early images from Webb’s major areas of inquiry and a preview of science missions ahead. 
Nasa has revealed five breath-taking new images of the early universe, taken by the James Webb Space Telescope, including one on Monday and four on Tuesday. 
Scientists say the pictures will change the way people see space.  
Early universe
The first image, which was released on Monday, shows “the deepest and sharpest infrared image of the distant universe to date,” NASA said.
The stunning shot, released in a White House briefing by President Joe Biden, is overflowing with thousands of galaxies and features some of the faintest objects observed, colourised in blue, orange and white tones.

Biden conveyed a sense of awe that Webb is documenting universe imagery from some 13 billion years ago.
“It’s hard to even fathom,” the president said. “These images are going to remind the world that America can do big things and remind the American people, especially our children, that there’s nothing beyond our capacity.” 
Known as Webb’s First Deep Field, it shows the galaxy cluster SMACS 0723, which acts as a gravitational lens, bending light from more distant galaxies behind it towards the observatory, in a cosmic magnification effect.
Webb’s primary imager NIRCam — which operates in the near infrared wavelength spectrum because light from the early universe has been stretched out by the time it reaches us — has brought these faint background galaxies into focus.
Webb compiled the composite shot in 12.5 hours, achieving well beyond what its predecessor the Hubble Space Telescope could in weeks.
“Fantastic — galaxies upon galaxies upon galaxies,” Jonathan Lunine, chair of the astronomy department at Cornell University, said, rejoicing with the rest of the global astronomy community. 
“First image from @NASAWebb — a piece of sky covered by a grain of sand at arm’s length. 1000’s of galaxies. The strange arcs are very distant galaxies — their images distorted by the warping of spacetime caused by the closer galaxy cluster,” tweeted Brian Cox, the professor of Particle Physics at The University of Manchester. 

 





 
Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said of the picture: “The spiked objects are local stars in our own galaxy. ignore them. Everything else is an entire galaxy.” 
The next set of images released on Tuesday revealed details about the atmosphere of faraway planets, “stellar nurseries” where stars form, galaxies locked in a dance of close encounters, and the cloud of gas around a dying star. 
Carina Nebula
The photo shows the “mountains” and “valleys” of a star-forming region called NGC 3324 in the Carina Nebula, dubbed the “Cosmic Cliffs,” 7,600 light years away.
Captured in infrared light by Webb, this image reveals for the first time previously invisible areas of star birth.

“For the first time we’re seeing brand new stars that were previously completely hidden from our view,” said NASA astrophysicist Amber Straughn.   
According to the BBC, one of Webb’s key scientific goals is to study how stars form and Carina is an excellent place to do that.
Southern Ring Nebula 
A dim star at the centre of the Southern Ring Nebula was revealed for the first time to be cloaked in dust, as it spews out rings of gas and dust in its death throes.
Understanding the molecules present in such stellar graveyards can help scientists learn more about the process of stellar death.

The Southern Ring is nearly half a light-year in diameter and is located about 2,000 light-years from Earth.
This kind of structure is known as a “planetary nebula”, but it has nothing to do with planets, the BCC reported. “It’s a misnomer from the early days of telescopes when they didn’t have anything like the resolution they have today.” 
Stephan’s Quintet
Webb also revealed never before seen details of Stephan’s Quintet, a grouping of five galaxies including four that experience repeated close encounters, which provide insights into how early galaxies formed at the start of the universe.
The telescope dramatically captures shockwaves as one of the galaxies smashes through the centre of the cluster.
About 290 million light-years away, the quintet is located in the constellation Pegasus. It’s notable for being the first compact galaxy group ever discovered. Four of the five galaxies within it are locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters. 
Hot gas giant exoplanet
The telescope also found water vapour in the atmosphere of a faraway gas planet. The spectroscopy — an analysis of light that reveals detailed information — was of planet WASP-96 b, which was discovered in 2014.
Nearly 1,150 light-years from Earth, WASP-96 b is about half the mass of Jupiter and zips around its star in just 3.4 days.

“We’ve seen the effect of what happens when a planet and its atmosphere passes in front of the star, and the star light filters through the atmosphere, and you can break that down into wavelengths of light,” said NASA’s Knicole Colon. “So, you’re actually seeing bumps and wiggles that indicate the presence of water vapor in the atmosphere of the planet.” 
What is the James Webb Space Telescope?
Launched in December 2021 from French Guiana on an Ariane 5 rocket, the telescope is orbiting the Sun at a distance of 1.6 million kilometres from Earth, in a region of space called the second Lagrange point.
Here, it remains in a fixed position relative to the Earth and Sun, with minimal fuel required for course corrections.
A wonder of engineering, the total project cost is estimated at $10 billion, making it one of the most expensive scientific platforms ever built, comparable to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.
Webb’s primary mirror is over 6.5 metres wide and is made up of 18 gold-coated mirror segments. Like a camera held in one’s hand, the structure must remain as stable as possible to achieve the best shots. 
After the first images, astronomers around the globe will get shares of time on the telescope, with projects selected competitively through a process in which applicants and selectors don’t know each other’s identities, to minimize bias.
Thanks to an efficient launch, NASA estimates Webb has enough propellant for a 20-year life, as it works in concert with the Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes to answer fundamental questions about the cosmos.
