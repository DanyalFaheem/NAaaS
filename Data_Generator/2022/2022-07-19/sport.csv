The hosts were 329-9 when bad light stopped play for the day with Sri Lanka leading by 333 in their second innings. 
Chandimal, who made 76 in the first innings, was batting on 86 with Prabath Jayasuriya on four at the other end. 
For them, Oshada Fernando (64) and Kusal Mendis (76) also made significant contribution during their 91-run stand for the third wicket at the Galle International Stadium. 
Mohammad Nawaz (5-88) claimed his maiden five-wicket haul and combined with fellow spinner Yasir Shah, who took three, to rattle the opposition middle-order in the second session. 
But the 32-year-oldChandimal, who struck blazing form with his maiden double century — 206 not out — in his team’s series-levelling Test win over Australia last week, stood firm in another lower-order show of defiance after the hosts slipped to 235-7. 
“Chandi batted so well in the first innings too. He has done what the team needs,” Mendis said of the veteran batsman. “This is a good total but if we get to that 350 mark, the bowlers will have lot of runs to play with. Tomorrow I think the wicket will get even better for spinners once you get the roller on.” 
Chandimal reached his fifty and put on 41 runs with Maheesh Theekshana for the ninth wicket in a repeat performance from the hosts, who had hit back from 133-8 to post 222 in their first innings. 
After Sri Lanka resumed on 36-1, Kasun Rajitha could have been dismissed in the first delivery of the day but Babar Azam spilled a catch in the slip. 
It did not really matter though as Nawaz dismissed Rajitha, who had walked in as the nightwatchman on Sunday, in the next over. 
Fernando and Mendis scored briskly to consolidate Sri Lanka’s position. 
Fernando reached his sixth Test fifty in the first session but fell to Yasir on the second ball after lunch. 
Mendis raised his fifty and took on the opposition attack with a few boundaries before Yasir (3-122) dismissed him with a gem of a delivery that landed way outside the leg stump and spun sharply to beat the bat and hit the top of the off-stump. 
Nawaz, who is making a Test comeback after nearly six years and playing his fourth five-day match, kept chipping 
away and got key wickets including Angelo Mathews and Niroshan Dickwella. 
But Chandimal continued to pile on the runs hitting five fours and two sixes in his resolute innings on a pitch that is expected to offer more turn to the spinners come day four. 
He brought up his 23rd half-century with a single to covers off Naseem Shah and was a thorn in Pakistan’s flesh again, stitching vital partnerships with the tail. 
Ramesh Mendis (22) added 32 runs with Chandimal for the eighth wicket while Jayasuriya has added a further 21 runs for the last wicket with Chandimal. 
Pakistan had an opportunity to dismiss Chandimal when he was on 68 but Hasan Ali put down a return catch. Pakistan also unsuccessfully reviewed a leg-before shout against him. 
In a keenly contested match of tail end fights, Pakistan had also hit back to post 218, riding on skipper Babar Azam’s 119 as he batted with his own lower order on day two. 
With Sri Lanka in a state of emergency, the second and final Test against Pakistan, originally scheduled in capital Colombo, will also be played in Galle.

The pace spearhead has been rested for all six games in August-September at Townsville and Cairns, while batsman Travis Head will be absent for birth of his first child.
But leg-spinner Adam Zampa returns following the arrival of his first child while Ashton Agar (side strain) and Sean Abbott (broken finger) rejoin the squad.
Mitchell Swepson, Josh Inglis, Jhye Richardson and Matthew Kuhnemann drop out of the ODI line-up that last played Sri Lanka.
Cricket Australia said Cummins was being managed  “through a period of rehabilitation and physical preparation for the upcoming summer”.
“These series against New Zealand, the world’s No.1 ranked ODI side, and Zimbabwe will be good contests, providing an opportunity to play some great cricket in the lead-up to the home summer,” said chairman of selectors George Bailey.
“The team is excited to be marking the start of a huge summer with these matches in North Queensland.”
Australia play three ODIs against Zimbabwe in Townsville from Aug 28 followed by three against New Zealand in Cairns from Sept 6.
Squad: Aaron Finch (captain), Sean Abbott, Ashton Agar, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschagne, Mitchell Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Marcus Stoinis, David Warner, Adam Zampa.

2,Pakistan to field full-strength contingent at Commonwealth Games,"A total of 103 athletes will represent Pakistan at the Games set to be held from July 28 to August 8 in Birmingham, England.","LAHORE: Pakistan’s participation in the Commonwealth Games with a full-strength contingent was confirmed Monday with the Pakistan Olympic Association and involved sports federations deciding to share the financial burden for the event with the country’s sports board.
A total of 103 athletes will represent Pakistan at the Games — set to be held from July 28 to August 8 in Birmingham, England — out of which the expenses of 56 will be borne by the Pakistan Sports Board, 27 will be supported by their respective sports federations while 20 members of the national women’s cricket team will be backed by the Pakistan Cricket Board.
The development meant Pakistan’s badminton squad, which was dropped by the PSB earlier, is set to feature at the Games.
The decision was taken in an “emergent” POA’s Executive Committee meeting on Saturday after the PSB had refused to take responsibility for the full contingent proposed by the POA and the federations.
The PSB had also cut short the originally decided, 114-member strong contingent for the Islamic Solidarity Games — scheduled to kick off on August 9 in Konya, Turkey — to 73. However, in Saturday’s meeting the POA and the federations decided to bear the expenses of the remaining 41 athletes.
The POA, however, criticised the PSB for demonstrating “no rationale” in imposing what it termed arbitrary cuts “without consulting any of the stakeholders”.
“The Executive Committee (EC) during its deliberation expressed serious concerns at the irrational and drastic reductions in the athletes and in some cases the replacement of officials other than those recommended by the Federations,” said a POA press release on Monday. 
“This reduction without any cogent or plausible reason was noted by the Athlete’s Commission representative who termed this as a very unfortunate development for those athletes who were working hard for years.
“The EC noted with great concern that these actions by the PSB and that too at this very belated stage have put in peril their participation leaving no choice but to opt for high cost travelling and other arrangements.”
The Pakistan contingent, which will feature the likes of Olympic javelin throw finalist Arshad Nadeem and wrestler Inam Butt, will depart for Birmingham on July 23. The women’s cricket team will join the group after the completion of their ongoing tri-series in Ireland.

3,Asia Cup likely to be shifted from Sri Lanka to UAE,Pakistan and India are likely to face each other twice in the cricket tournament's league phase.,"ISLAMABAD: The Asia Cup cricket tournament, which would likely see Pakistan and India facing each other twice in the event’s league phase, was expected to be shifted out from Sri Lanka, to Dubai and Sharjah.
Very recently, Sri Lanka successfully hosted a full tour of Australia and is currently hosting a Test series against Pakistan in Galle without any major hassles.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) would remain the official host of the Asia Cup which this time will be played in the T20 format. But the 15th edition of the continental event was set to be played in Dubai and Sharjah from Aug 27 and Sept 11. The decision was taken at an Asian Cricket Council (ACC) meeting this week.
Up until last week, SLC was  “very confident” of hosting the Asia Cup despite the country’s deepening economic and political crisis with food supplies drying up, fuel supply being cut to private vehicles, and severe daily power outages.
“Hosting two teams is not the same as hosting ten teams,” ESPNcricinfo quoted SLC chief executive officer Ashley de Silva as saying.
“You have to provide ten buses with fuel for all of them. You have to give every team a luggage van with fuel, and transport for the managers. You also have to give the sponsors transport and ensure that they are getting the mileage that they want from their sponsorship. The fuel for the generators to run the floodlights will also have to be found,” de Silva said.
The ACC was set to announce the schedule of the Asia Cup on July 22 and it would likely have Pakistan and India facing each other twice in the league phase.
“There are also two India vs Pakistan matches, and there will be people who want to travel and watch those matches. People might not be happy to travel to Sri Lanka because of the situation,” he added.
This would be the second time in the last five years that the UAE will host the Asia Cup. In 2018, the tournament, played in the 50-overs format, was conducted in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah in September.

4,Mohammad Nawaz relishing Test return with ‘dream’ five-wicket haul,28-year-old impresses with his left-arm spin to dent Sri Lankan top and middle-order in first Test match in Galle.,"GALLE: Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz said on Monday that his maiden five-wicket haul on return to Test cricket was a  “dream” performance he aimed to repeat.
The 28-year-old Nawaz, who played just three Tests for Pakistan in 2016, impressed with his left-arm spin to dent the Sri Lankan top and middle-order in the first match in Galle.
He combined with leg-spinner Yasir Shah to reduce Sri Lanka to 267 for eight but the hosts hit back with Dinesh Chandimal’s unbeaten 86 to lead by 333 at the end of the third day’s play.
“It’s every bowler’s dream to get a five-for in Test cricket and the same goes for me,” Nawaz told reporters.
“I am very happy and I will keep working hard and repeat this kind of performance again.”
Nawaz made his debut across formats in 2016 but his five-day career came to a halt after just three Tests against West Indies in the United Arab Emirates.
His white-ball reputation has grown, with 19 One-day Internationals and 30 Twenty20 matches for the national team, but he insists red-ball cricket is what excites him most.
“I kept on playing first-class cricket, obviously played a lot of white-ball international cricket but a Test opportunity didn’t come my way,” Nawaz said of his cricketing journey.
“Focus was to play red-ball cricket which makes you grow as a player. My 2022 red-ball season at home was good as I made over 700 runs and took 28-29 wickets.
“I’m happy to bowl well on my comeback and hoping to turn up with the bat as well.”
Babar Azam’s Pakistan will need to bowl out Sri Lanka, who were 329-9 at stumps, on the fourth day and then chase an already challenging-looking total.
But Nawaz remains confident of the Pakistan batting that fought back from 87-5 to just four runs short of Sri Lanka’s 222 in the first innings.
“They have put up a good total, looking at the conditions, but it’s not impossible,” he said. “As a batting unit if we get two-three good partnerships then it will be achievable I think.”

Pandya, an explosive batter and a crafty seam bowler, underwent a lower back surgery in 2019 and has since often played purely as a batsman while India waited for him to resume bowling regularly.
The 28-year-old signalled he has regained full fitness on their tour of England, claiming 4-24 and smashing 71 in Sunday’s series-clinching victory in the final ODI.
He bowled at full tilt in the preceding T20 series in England too claiming 4-33 in Southampton to go with a half-century in that match.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan has termed Pandya the most important man in the Indian team and he is not the only one who believes so.
“Hardik Pandya is fast becoming India’s most important player in white-ball cricket,” tweeted former India opener Aakash Chopra.  “A fit Hardik is simply priceless...”  Pandya said it felt  “special” to be able to contribute with both bat and ball.
“That has given me a lot of confidence, when I have been able to do that. It adds layers to my game,” he said after Sunday’s victory in Manchester.
With the T20 World Cup looming later this year in Australia, Pandya bowling at full throttle is music to the ears of the team management.

6,Pogacar trails Vingegaard but takes fresh momentum into Tour third week,"CARCASSONNE: Jonas Vingegaard holds a commanding ahead of the final week of the Tour de France, but with the Dane...","CARCASSONNE: Jonas Vingegaard holds a commanding ahead of the final week of the Tour de France, but with the Dane reeling from a crash and having lost two key team mates, Tadej Pogacar is taking a fresh momentum into the Pyrenees.
Defending champion Pogacar was toppled last week in a gruelling Alpine stage after coming under sustained fire from Vingegaard and his Jumbo Visma team-mates, but the Slovenian has vowed to fight until the end.
Despite a two minute and 22 second-deficit, the 23-year-old can still hope to win a third consecutive Tour.
On Sunday, Vingegaard hit the deck and sustained bruises on his left side while Steven Kruijswijk crashed out and Primoz Roglic abandoned after failing to recover from a back injury.
It leaves Jumbo Visma down to six riders and with one of them, Tiesj Benoot, battered and bruised after also crashing on Sunday, the Dutch outfit could struggle to control the aggressive Pogacar.
“I need to grab every chance, use every climb there is. I need to try and attack,” Pogacar told reporters on Monday. “I will give everything and I hope I don’t have any regrets.”
Pogacar tried last Thursday on the climb to l’Alpe d’Huez but after being greatly helped by his team’s fast tempo in the first part of the ascent, Vingegaard followed easily.
With Kruijswijk and Roglic out, the 25-year-old will be less protected.
“It’s going to be a crazy third week,” Groupama-FDJ sports director Philippe Mauduit, whose leader David Gaudu is gunning for a top five finish in Paris, said.
Tuesday’s 16th stage features two brutal category-one climb before the 17th and 18th stages take the peloton into some of the toughest climbs of the Pyrenees.
Vingegaard said he felt good after his crash.
“I slept well. I’m a bit bruised but I’m good. It stings a little but I’m not hurting,” he said on Monday. “I still have a two-minute and 22-second lead so we’re good, even if losing two team-mates is not a good thing.”
Behind the leading duo is 2018 champion Geraint Thomas, who cannot match Vingegaard and Pogacar’s explosivity but the Briton has so far managed to limit the damage and his Ineos-Grenadiers team have three riders in the top 10.
“I think up to this point Jonas has been the strongest, he’s been able to respond to every attack as well and he’s been riding cleverly,” said Thomas. “But it’s a three week race not 15 days.”
Will Ineos-Grenadiers collide with Pogacar to unsettle Vingegaard?   “It’s not like Pogacar is gonna be ringing me up and we’re gonna make a plan tonight but once you’re on the road if a situation comes where it works for both of us it’s just like any other race,” Thomas explained.
“But it’s not like a vendetta against Jonas or Jumbo, but it’s bike racing, so anything can happen.”

7,Stokes announces shock retirement from ODI cricket,LONDON: England’s Ben Stokes will retire from One-day International cricket after Tuesday’s series opener ...,"LONDON: England’s Ben Stokes will retire from One-day International cricket after Tuesday’s series opener against South Africa on his Durham home ground, citing an  “unsustainable” schedule as the motivation for his shock decision.
Stokes, who became England Test captain in April, made his ODI debut in 2011 and his standout performance in the format came in the 2019 World Cup final against New Zealand.
The charismatic all-rounder scored an unbeaten 84 in the Lord’s final to force a super over that ended with England becoming 50-over world champions for the first time by the slenderest of margins.
But in the three years since that triumphant moment, the 31-year-old has played just nine more ODIs due to injuries, a mental health break and workload management.
He will turn out one last time at Chester-le-Street against South Africa on Tuesday before focusing on his Test captaincy and Twenty20 career.
Stokes, who has scored 2,919 runs and taken 74 wickets with his lively fast-medium bowling in 104 ODIs, said in a social media post on Monday that it had been an  “incredibly tough decision to make”.
“As hard as a decision as this was to come to, it’s not as hard [as] dealing with the fact I can’t give my teammates 100 percent of myself in this format any more,” he said.
“The England shirt deserves nothing less from anyone who wears it. Three formats are just unsustainable for me now.
“Not only do I feel that my body is letting me down because of the schedule and what is expected of us, but I also feel that I am taking the place of another player who can give [captain] Jos [Buttler] and the rest of the team their all.
“I will give everything I have to Test cricket, and now, with this decision, I feel I can also give my total commitment to the T20 format.”
Stokes’s decision to quit ODIs follows the retirement last month of World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan, who helped shape England into a formidable force in the white-ball game.
Clare Connor, interim CEO at the England and Wales Cricket Board, described Stokes as a  “superstar in every format of our game”.
“Ben is not only one of the world’s best players, but an inspirational figure too so our ODI team will miss him,” she said.
“But having taken on the Test captaincy and with today’s busy calendar of cricket, we completely understand and respect his decision.”
Stokes’s decision to step down comes after England’s 2-1 series defeat against India, in which he scored 48 runs in three innings but only bowled three overs.
He has been rested from the three T20 games against South Africa that will follow the three-match ODI series against the Proteas.
England have crammed seven Tests and 12 limited overs internationals into their home season following a punishing touring programme.
Former England captain Nasser Hussain criticised the  “joke” schedule, lamenting Stokes’s retirement.
“If the ICC (International Cricket Council) just keeps putting on ICC events, and the individual boards just keep filling in the gaps with as much cricket as possible, then eventually these cricketers will say ‘I’m done’,” he told Sky Sports.
Stokes and new red-ball head coach Brendon McCullum have been widely praised for reviving England’s Test fortunes with an aggressive approach that has led to spectacular wins against New Zealand and India in recent weeks.
A three-Test series against South Africa starts at Lord’s on Aug 17.

8,"Fraser-Pryce leads Jamaican sweep in 100m, US win four crowns","EUGENE (Oregon): Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce made history Sunday as she bagged a fifth world 100m title on Sunday,...","EUGENE (Oregon): Shelley-Ann Fraser-Pryce made history Sunday as she bagged a fifth world 100m title on Sunday, leading a Jamaican clean sweep in the women’s final while American athletes continued to clean up on home soil by clinching four other golds on offer. 
Fraser-Pryce, a 35-year-old mother, led from gun to tape in a consummate display of sprinting that belied her age. 
The Jamaican, who previously won the blue riband event in 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2019, won after clocking 10.67 to edge Shericka Jackson and Elaine Thompson-Herah, the same three athletes who swept the Olympic podium in Tokyo. 
“I can’t even imagine the amount of times I’ve had setbacks and I’ve bounced back and I’m here again,” Fraser-Pryce said. “I feel blessed to have this talent and to continue to do it at 35, having a baby, still going, and hopefully inspiring women that they can make their own journey.” 
Jackson took silver in a personal best of 10.73sec, with four-time Olympic sprint champion Thompson-Herah claiming bronze (10.81). 
It was the first time a nation had swept the medals in the women’s 100m at the worlds and came just a day after Fred Kerley led a US sweep of the men’s 100m. 
“It was definitely something on the cards,” Fraser-Pryce said of the potential sweep. “I’m glad I was the one who finished first in the sweep and I’m glad the other ladies came through and we were able to celebrate the 1-2-3.”
In a startling day of results for Team USA on home soil, Oregon native Ryan Crouser, a double Olympic champion and world record holder, led an American clean sweep in the men’s shot put and finally got his elusive world gold after his throw of 22.94m set a championship record. 
Defending champion Joe Kovacs took silver with Josh Awotunde capturing bronze. 
Olympic champion Katie Nageotte cleared 4.85m to win the women’s pole vault with compatriot Sandi Morris taking a third consecutive silver. 
It was a third straight gold in the field events for US women after Brooke Andersen’s triumph in the hammer throw earlier in the day and Chase Ealey’s shot put success on Saturday. 
American Grant Holloway retained his 110m hurdles title in a chaotic final that saw Jamaica’s Olympic champion Hansle Parchment injured in the warmup and Devon Allen disqualified for a false start. 
Allen, who produced the third-fastest time in the event in June and was one of the favourites in Eugene, moved 0.01 seconds too soon. 
“It feels good to win in front of the home crowd,” said Holloway, who came home in 13.03 seconds, ahead of compatriot Trey Cunningham and Spain’s Asier Martinez. 
Holloway admitted that he had sympathy for Allen’s marginal false start call. 
“I didn’t think he false started at all,” he said. “But technology says otherwise. It’s one of those things. It’s athletics. Anything can happen in track and field. It is what it is.” 
Allen meanwhile described his false start as “frustrating”. 
“You train a whole year for one competition that lasts 13 seconds and that’s that,” Allen said. “It happens and I’ll learn from it — and I’ll make sure I don’t react as fast next time.” 
In the morning session, hammer thrower Andersen threw 77.56m to win gold and compatriot Janee Kassanavoid took bronze. Camryn Rogers finished second to win Canada’s first world hammer medal. 
Tamirat Tola won the men’s marathon, finishing more than a minute clear in a world championships record time of two hours, 05.37 minutes and leading a 1-2 finish for Ethiopia. 
Mosinet Geremew took silver and Bashir Abdi the bronze. 
Uganda’s world record holder Joshua Cheptegei held off all challengers on the final lap to retain his 10,000m crown in 27:27.43. 
Kenyan Stanley Mburu claimed silver and Cheptegei’s compatriot Jacob Kiplimo the bronze. 
Elsewhere on the track, Norway’s Karsten Warholm qualified smoothly for Tuesday’s 400m hurdles final. 
The 26-year-old Olympic champion and world record holder has been out injured with a hamstring injury, but he vowed this week he was at 100% and looked comfortable as he coasted through his semi-final in his bid to bag a third consecutive world title. 
Joining him in the final will be his principal arch-rivals American Rai Benjamin and Brazil’s Alison Dos Santos, the silver and bronze medallists in Tokyo. 
Belgium’s Olympic champion Nafi Thiam was in control of the heptathlon after four events, having registerd 13.21sec in the 100m hurdles, 1.95sec in the high jump, 15.03m in the shot put and 24.39sec in the 200m. 
That left her with 4,071 points, 61 ahead of Anouk Vetter of the Netherlands, while reigning world champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson of Britain sat in sixth on 3,798pts.

9,Ibrahimovic to play on past 41 after extending Milan deal,MILAN: Evergreen AC Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will stay at the Serie A champions beyond his 41st birthday...,"MILAN: Evergreen AC Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic will stay at the Serie A champions beyond his 41st birthday after agreeing a one-year contract extension, the club said on Monday.
Details of the contract were not released, but a source close to the deal said the Swede has accepted a reduced salary given he will be unable to play until 2023 after undergoing surgery on his left knee in May. 
“AC Milan is pleased to announce the renewal of Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s contract until June 30, 2023,” Milan said in a short statement.  
“The Swedish forward will continue to wear the number 11 shirt.”  
Ibrahimovic, Sweden’s all-time top scorer with 62 goals, returned to his former club Milan in January 2020 after leaving Major League Soccer team LA Galaxy.
Although his second stint at the Italian side has been riddled with injuries, Ibrahimovic has made 74 appearances and scored 36 goals in all competitions since his return, helping Milan win their first Serie A title in 11 years last term.

Well Done Pakistan, trained by Abid Mahmood, scored the victory by half-a-length ahead of favourite filly Sand Storm who could not take advantage of the soft turf conditions as she constantly hung towards the rails making things difficult for her champion jockey Aftab Choudhry to thwart a late challenge by the eventual winner. 
Neglected colt Mera Gondal finished third in this fourth contest of the five-race card.
Earlier in the opener, 30-to-100 favourite colt Pride Of Chandrai was disqualified after he won the race on an objection raised by Ashfaq Liaquat, the rider of second-placed bay gelding Danial Prince. According to Ashfaq, The winner had bumped into Danial Prince near the one-and-a-half furlong post which caused a significant drawback resulting in the latter losing the race by less than two lengths.
Upholding the objection, the administrators awarded the race to Danial Prince. 
Chestnut horse Noman The Great smartly ridden by female rider Alishba Mohsin earned the runner-up spot less than a length behind.
The third race was won by bay gelding Sehar who was given a two-pound concession on the appeal of the owner for harshly penalizing in the handicap. He beat favourite colt Chhota Bravo by half-a-length in a dramatic finish when Chhota Bravo looked a certain winner just five odd metres before the finish line. That proved handicap figures played a decisive role in the horse’s performance.
In the concluding event, the Sawan Plate Class VII Division I and II combined handicap race, favourite colt Lucky Sona led from start to the last 50 metres but was overtaken by bay horse Salam-e-Dera who responded well to the urging of his rider Mubashar Bhatti to land a two lengths success.
Bay filly Queen’s Gambit finished third.
The punters had a lean day as none of the favourite horses won in spite of the fact that a couple of them looked well-placed in the handicap or classification but even those slithered pathetically; perhaps soft turf conditions did not suit them.

“I’m finally here. I’m delighted to be at Barca,” the former Bayern Munich star told Barca TV after joining his new team-mates in Miami where Barcelona are starting a four-match US tour this week.
“The last few days have been long, but finally an agreement has been reached. I’m ready to take on this new challenge,” continued the 33-year-old.
“I’ve always wanted to play in La Liga and in the big teams, so Barca is a great opportunity for me. I’m here to help Barca get back to the top and win as many titles as possible.”
Barcelona’s last domestic title was in 2019 and their last Champions League trophy in 2015.
On Saturday, Bayern Munich announced that they had reached an agreement with Barcelona for Lewandowski after two months of endless negotiations between the clubs.
The two-time FIFA men’s player of the year has reportedly agreed a four-year deal worth 50 million euros ($50.4m), including five million in potential add-ons.
He is the club’s fourth summer transfer after Ivory Coast midfielder Franck Kessie from AC Milan and Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen on a free transfer, and Brazil winger Raphinha, recruited for 70 million euro from Leeds United.
The club has also extended the contract of French winger Ousmane Dembele, who is committed until 2024.
A very generous transfer window for a club which suffered from an abysmal debt, exceeding one billion euros in the long term, a few months ago.

13,Four nations express interest in hosting 2023 Asian Cup,"KUALA LUMPUR: South Korea, Australia, Indonesia and Qatar have submitted expressions of interest to replace China as...","KUALA LUMPUR: South Korea, Australia, Indonesia and Qatar have submitted expressions of interest to replace China as hosts of next year’s Asian Cup, the Asian Football Confederation said on Monday. 
The deadline for the four associations to submit their bid documents has been set for Aug 31, and the AFC’s executive committee will announce the new host on Oct 17, it said. 
China was due to host the 24-team event, scheduled for June and July next year, but the country’s efforts to follow a zero-Covid-19 policy —a strategy that makes staging sports events a major challenge — resulted in it being moved. 
South Korea won the inaugural Asian Cup in 1956 and retained the trophy as hosts four years later — the only time they staged the finals. The country has not staged a major soccer tournament since co-hosting the World Cup with Japan in 2002. 
Australia are aiming to host the competition for a second time, after staging it in 2015. 
Australia, Asian Cup winners in 2015, said a final decision to bid would be contingent upon scheduling and “significant” government funding. 
Australia already has a busy 2023 as co-hosts of next year’s Women’s World Cup with New Zealand which starts on July 20. 
“Our preference would be to host in Feb 2024 so we are not clashing with the FIFA WWC 2023,” a Football Australia spokesperson said. 
“We are liaising with governments at all levels to gauge interest levels before contemplating a bid, as any events of this stature require significant government funding and support.” 
Qatar will stage the men’s World Cup this year from Nov 21 to Dec 18. They have hosted the Asian Cup twice, in 1988 and 2011, and won the tournament in 2019. 
Indonesia were one of four co-hosts of the 2007 Asian Cup. 
Football Australia added that it had also expressed interest in hosting the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup, with a final decision to bid due by next March. 
Australia were knocked out of the quarter-finals of the 2022 Women’s Asian Cup won by China and hosted by India in January-February.

15,Open champion Smith makes name for himself in Australia,MELBOURNE: The name Cameron Smith has long resonated in sports-mad Australia but more for the achievements of a...,"MELBOURNE: The name Cameron Smith has long resonated in sports-mad Australia but more for the achievements of a retired rugby league star than the prodigious golfing talent that tore up the back nine on the way to British Open glory. 
That may be set to change after Smith’s stunning one-stroke triumph at St Andrews, where the 28-year-old became the first Australian to hoist the Claret Jug since Greg Norman in 1993. 
His namesake, the former Melbourne Storm, Queensland and Australia champion, may now have to become used to seeing his name bracketed with rugby league in media reports, a fate that often befell “Cameron Smith, the golfer”. 
Australian golf fans have long known Smith’s quality and followed him closely since he finished joint fourth at the 2015 US Open at Chambers Bay, won by another then-21-year-old by the name of Jordan Speith. 
Smith’s blistering second shot from 283 yards at the closing hole at that tournament nearly fell in for an albatross and marked the emergence of a talent worthy of the company of compatriots Adam Scott and Jason Day. 
It certainly opened doors, with the top-five finish securing US Tour membership for the rest of the year and an invitation to the next Masters. 
With vast space for courses and a track record of producing major champions, Australia has rarely wanted for golfing talent. 
But until Sunday, the biggest names had endured only frustration at the majors since Day’s PGA Championship win in 2015. 
Smith suffered his own heartbreak this year at the Masters where his final-day chase of eventual winner Scottie Scheffler ended abruptly when his tee-shot at the 12th splashed into Rae’s Creek and led to a triple-bogey. 
A collective groan rang out from the nation’s newspapers the following day but on Monday, Smith was hailed as a master putter by local media which carried glowing tributes from tour rivals. 
“He’s tough, and hes owned his game. He’s learned how to play golf very well, very quickly,” said Scott. 
The 28-year-old produced a stunning last round 64 to lift the Claret Jug on Sunday, holding off playing partner Cameron Young and third-placed Rory McIlroy. 
The Sydney Morning Herald called it “a staggering performance”, while The Australian broadsheet said he was “the best putter in the sport”. 
“The champion golfer of the year. Our champion. Congratulations Cameron Smith,” said the PGA of Australia. 
Smith’s only disappointment at St Andrews was to not have family watching green-side, a regret his father Des now shares after deciding against the long trip from Brisbane. 
“There were plenty of tears, it probably got to the point where I couldn’t talk any more,” Des Smith told Fox Sports of a phone call he shared with his son at the clubhouse. 
“It’s all tiny little steps, he’s gone from one stage to another and he’s always excelled every time he’s stepped up to another stage so I always thought he was going to win a major.” 
LIV CONCERNS 
Smith’s breakthrough makes the mullet-haired golfer hot property and will surely boost his value for organisers of Greg Norman’s breakaway LIV series. 
Smith bristled when asked if he was on the verge of joining the Saudi-backed LIV in his post-win press conference but did not deny reports he might be among a slew of top players about to jump ship from the US Tour. 
“I don’t know, mate,” Smith said when asked. “My team around me worries about all that stuff. I’m here to win golf tournaments.” 
News Corp newspapers in Australia reported that a number of high-profile Australians were poised to move to LIV now that the last major of 2022 was over. 
“Let’s get down to brass tacks. Cameron Smith is likely to abandon traditional golf,” The Australian said. “The consensus is that he’ll join the rebel LIV brigade while his fingerprints are still fresh on the Claret Jug.” 
By winning the Open, Smith became only the fifth Australian to claim the title alongside Peter Thomson, Kel Nagle, Ian Baker-Finch and Norman. 
Norman led the applause for his countryman, tweeting: “Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi! A spectacular final round mate. A triumph for you and for Australia as the first Australian to win in 29 years. You’re in good company. Enjoy every moment of your @TheOpen victory.” 
Sydney Morning Herald columnist Peter FitzSimons said Smith’s triumph would be “stained” if he opted to switch to the LIV tour. 
“Hopefully, if Smith has indeed talked to Norman about joining the tour, he will come to his senses, run screaming from the room and burn the clothes he was in at the time,” he said. 
“He will remain the new Australian sporting hero, bar none, an everyman Australian bloke, who just happens to be one of the best and most thrilling golfers in the world, who nevertheless recognises that there are more important things than making money.” 
Having only just fulfilled his major dream and earned a nation’s thanks, Smith’s next career move will be closely watched, with a decision to join the Norman-backed tour unlikely to generate universal acclaim.
