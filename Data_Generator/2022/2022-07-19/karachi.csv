SSP-South Asad Raza said that the senior police and district administration officials held talks with the protesting teachers at the KPC. They were informed that a summary for regularisation of their jobs had been moved to the chief minister and they should wait for the government decision in this regard.
He said that the protesters were also informed about a ban on staging rallies / gatherings in the red zone. However, despite this, the protesting teachers removed barricades and started running towards the CM House.
He said police intercepted them near Jinnah Courts on Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road, resorted to baton charge and took into custody 35 teachers. He said that six female teachers were also detained, but they were released immediately.
Both tracks of Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road leading towards the CM House were closed for vehicular traffic, which was diverted on alternative routes.
Later, the protesting teachers resumed their protest at the KPC. 
Talking to the media, the teachers said they passed required tests and were appointed on a contract basis in 2018 but despite the passage of three years, their services were not being regularised, prompting them to initiate a protest movement. 
They claimed that they were holding a peaceful protest but the police subjected them to torture and detained their colleagues including females.
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the South police said that all protesting teachers were released after they undertook not to venture into the red zone again.
He said that the police condemned the manhandling of a female teacher by a policewoman. “The policewoman has been suspended and action is being taken against her,” he said.

3,People asked to take measures for prevention of Naegleria,"KARACHI: The Karachi Metr­opolitan Corporation on Monday issued precautionary measures to prevent Naegleria,...","KARACHI: The Karachi Metr­opolitan Corporation on Monday issued precautionary measures to prevent Naegleria, commonly referred to as the ‘brain-eating amoeba’, during the ongoing monsoon season.
The medical and health services department of the city’s municipal administration informed the citizens that they could protect themselves and their families from getting infected with Naegleria by fully implementing the measures.
However, if one develops symptoms such as fever, headache, neck pain, nausea, blurred vision, insomnia and lack of sleep, he should consult a doctor immediately and follow the doctor’s instructions, the advisory said.
Citizens have been asked to avoid bathing in water that has been accumulated either due to rain during the monsoon or as a result of leaks from dilapidated water supply pipelines.
“If you have to bathe in pools, lakes and swimming pools in recreational areas, keep your head high, otherwise Naegleria bacteria can enter the body through the nose and destroy brain cells,” the advisory read.
It added that prevention of other epidemic diseases, including Naegleria, would be possible only when necessary measures were taken at the government level as well as awareness was raised among the citizens themselves.
The citizens should take precautionary measures issued by the medical institutions to protect the health of themselves and their families.
The advisory said that Naegleria was likely to spread during the monsoon season, so citizens should take all possible precautions.
It added that the major source of Naegleria infection was warm, fresh water and unchlorinated water supplies, and the disease manifested as severe disease within two to 15 days after the bacteria enter the body.
The citizens have been advised to use boiled water for ablution and bath and avoid rinsing the nose with unchlorinated or boiled water while suffering from a common cold or nasal congestion.
“Use one tablespoon of bleach per 1,000 liters of water to prevent infection. Clean the above and underground water tanks in the house twice a year,” the advisory said.
The advisory asked the citizens to follow the precautionary measures issued to prevent Naegleria and other germs.

4,"Rupee devaluation to cause brain drain, lead to anarchy: HCCI",HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) believes latest devaluation of Pakistani rupee...,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (HCCI) believes latest devaluation of Pakistani rupee versus US dollar will lead to brain drain and the exacerbating economic conditions may cause anarchy.
HCCI president Adeel Siddiqui said in a statement issued here on Monday that the US dollar’s rise against Pakistani rupee, gaining Rs7.3 in interbank trade would affect everything. 
“Our country in fact recorded the highest inflation on July 18, which will cause billions of rupees losses to importers in a single day rather in a few minutes. This takes new rate of dollar to Rs218.30,” he added.
“The devaluation in rupee makes the country less attractive to workers and force Pakistani workers to prefer to work abroad. It will eventually result in brain drain, which in fact spells demise of Pakistani industry,” said Mr Siddiqui. 
“How will we be able to produce technical manpower when our own workforce starts leaving the country,” he said. 
He said that the consequent economic conditions were in fact now posing risk of anarchy. Current appreciation in dollar, he said, would make exports more competitive which would appear cheaper to foreign buyers. 
“It will increase demand for exports and our assets will become inexpensive to foreign buyers from business point of view,” he said. 
He said that since the entire world was facing recession, the devaluation would not help boost exports’ demand.
“Pakistani industrialists are in fact facing a Godzilla like economic crunch which is evident from this historic devaluation, higher mark-up rate, higher electricity tariff amid unavailability of gas resource. 
We have not seen such situation in the past,” he said.  
He said that devaluation was aimed at meeting a certain exchange rate target and that would not be appropriate for economy. “Perhaps this devaluation of rupee is taking place as per target set by IMF,” he noted.
The HCCI president deplored the fact that dollar’s upward journey had rendered everything null and void as far as decline in oil prices was concerned. “We have seen crude oil prices falling in the international market recently. 
But with this depreciation in rupee, there will be no international market correction impact for us,” he said. 
He said this trend of economy, however, would only be suitable for trade alone instead of industries.

5,"‘King of Kohistan’ faces new challengers  in shape of Jamshoro Ittehad, Hindu seths",JAMSHORO: The one name that has indisputably dominated the politics of Jamshoro district over the decades is Malik...,"JAMSHORO: The one name that has indisputably dominated the politics of Jamshoro district over the decades is Malik Asad Sikandar, who has been in and out of Pakistan Peoples Party for political reasons, but the self-styled ‘King of Kohistan’ is now facing new challengers in the form of Jamshoro Ittehad — a conglomerate of anti-Malik parties, communities and individuals — and increasingly assertive wealthy Hindu community. 
Malik, a powerful tribal chieftain, wields so great an influence in the area that the mountainous region has become synonymous with his name. After having dissociated from PPP during Musharraf rule, Malik retuned to the party’s fold soon after the party leader’s assassination. 
He is one of the three sitting members of Sindh Assembly from Jamshoro besides Sindh chief minister Murad Ali Shah and Giyanoo Mal though he won his last election on the basis of a controversial poll result challenged before Election Tribunal by his rival and disgruntled PPP leader, Dr Sikandar Shoro, on Kotri’s constituency of PS-82.
As always, PPP has nominated all candidates for the second phase of local government scheduled for July 24 exclusively according to Malik’s advice though for quite some time, Malik has had a roller-coaster ride in the party. 
He had fallen out of the party leader’s favour in 2017 in the wake of his dispute with Bahria Town over land acquisition in his area. At one point he had felt isolated in his own native district and had to struggle to win provincial seat in 2018 polls. 
As Jamshoro district nazim under Musharraf regime, Malik had opposed Sikandar Shoro in February 2007 by-poll on Kotri provincial seat, leading to victory of Pir Mujib Jillani. 
Dr Shoro did not forget that defeat. He has formed the alliance of anti-Malik parties and individual by the name of “Jamshoro Ittehad” for LG elections, to give Malik, his ex-party colleague, the taste of his own medicine. Shoro is also making overtures to PPP for a ‘reunion’ but talks before polls between the two sides have so far remained inconclusive.
“Malik has placed some conditions before the party leadership for Shoro and his allies’ rejoining of the party,” said an observer. 
“Malik wants Shoro to join PPP alone and leave his allies as they are part of tribes and sub-tribes who Malik presides but Dr Shoro doesn’t agree to this proposition and wants to enter PPP along with his allies who have stood by him through thick and thin,” he said.
“All the candidates are indeed PPP’s nominees but they are choice of Malik sahib,” said a local observer. The party heavily relied on Malik’s advice for the selection of candidates in Jamshoro, Thana Bula Khan and Kotri except Sehwan taluka, the chief minister’s hometown.
Jamshoro has 30 UCs, one district council with 30 directly elected seats, five town committees (Bhan Syedabad, Sann, Manjhand, Thana Bula Khan and Jamshoro), three municipal committees (Kotri, Bolhari and Sehwan). It has a population of 993,908 with 258,893 male and 213,829 female voters (total 472,722 voters) in four talukas of Sehwan, Kotri, Thana Bula Khan and Manjhand.
The other influential factor in Jamshoro district’s politics is the family of founder of nationalist movement late G.M. Syed whose paternal grandson, Syed Jalal Mahmood Shah, heads Sindh United Party and is a major part of Jamshor Ittehad. 
Changing times
Jamshoro has considerable Hindu population mostly concentrated in Thana Bula Khan (TBK) taluka. Most Hindu seths who dominate business of pesticides, seed and cotton ginning and rice mills sectors hail. 
TBK town committee has six wards with 10,918 registered voters in seven union councils. “The mobile phone connectivity has played a central role in changing minds of people in Kohistan as people start using social media,” said a local resident.
Malik’s native Thana Ahmed Khan was located in this taluka. Kohistan region falls in TBK in Jamshoro and Jhimpir of Thatta districts where people often face drought conditions as the area is mostly rain-dependent. 
TBK’s powerful Hindu community that has always remained at Malik’s beck and call has lately started asserting itself. Wealthy Hindu seths usually lead Panchayats, which are increasingly feeling disenchanted within Malik’s circle.
“In one case, Malik sahib cold-shouldered Hindu Panchayat of UC Sari on election issue and that’s why Panchayat decided to field its own candidate for vice chairman’s slot in alliance with Jamshoro Alliance’s candidate against PPP,” he said. 
Jamshoro Alliance is a potent challenger. “But Malik still matters,” he quipped. 
Malik Asad didn’t respond to repeated calls and messages by the correspondent.
“Today our community fellows are contesting again in Kohistan. It is something unheard of and unseen over the past 72 years,” argued Kesoo Mal Kheeal Das Kohistani, sitting PML-N MNA on a reserved seat. 
“I first contested on Jamshoro’s NA seat in 2018 polls and received only 500 votes from Thana Ahmed Khan’s polling station, which were the highest votes of mine in Malik’s area,” he recalled.
Candidates of Shoro-led Jamshoro Ittehad oppose PPP-Malik candidates on his home turf. The alliance is primarily banking on 10 district council’s seats although it is eyeing 19 seats out of 30. Jalal Mahmood Shah will be focusing on Manjhand and Sann town or probably Bhan Syedabad.
Jamshoro Ittehad comprises SUP’s Syed Jalal Mahmood Shah, Malik Changez (Malik’s relative), Birhamanis, Khaskhelis, Nadeem Jillani and Palari Ittehad. 
Malik’s son, Malik Sikandar has also joined the fray, taking on his father’s opponents who were using social media against the candidates nominated by his father and PPP.
For the first time, Malik could not get even a single pair of chairman and vice chairman elected unopposed in 30 directly contested seats of district council even in his own hometown, UC Thana Ahmed Khan in TBK. Ward councillors were indeed elected unopposed here. 
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, however, got three pairs of chairmen and vice chairmen elected unopposed in UCs Banbha, Wahur and Bajara in Sehwan. “Historically, candidates in LG polls used to be elected unopposed in fairly large numbers in Kohistan but the situation has changed now,” Kohistani said.
In UC Sari that touches Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway, the alliance’s candidate Lajpat Khatwani is facing PPP-Malik candidate following local Hindu Panchayat’s decision. In another UC Mole of TBK, a Hindu candidate is facing Malik-PPP’s candidate. 
In UC Thana Ahmed Khan, the alliance’s Rakesh Kumar is facing PPP-Malik candidate Vishnu Mal. In UC Mole, the alliance’s Khair Mohammad Shehno and Abbas Shehno pair face PPP’s Rashid Hamlani and Lekhraj pair. Indeed, electoral landscape in Jamshoro district is going to get exciting by each day till July 24.

7,Rights bodies demand ‘respectful’ repatriation of Afghan immigrants,KARACHI: A meeting of the independent human rights commissions and civil society on Monday demanded that the...,"KARACHI: A meeting of the independent human rights commissions and civil society on Monday demanded that the government come up with a clear policy on Afghan immigrants, including their status and make sure that all Afghans were repatriated respectfully and their stay in Pakistan be governed under the UN regulations.
Co-chaired by Sindh Human Rights Commission chairperson retired Justice Majida Razvi and National Commission for Human Rights member Anis Haroon, the meeting was also attended by Sindh Status of Women Commission (SCSW) chairperson Nuzhat Shirin, Resident Director Aurat Foundation Mahnaz Rahman and human rights activists Asghar Dashti, Adam Malik, Shahid Jatoi, Naghma Iqtidar, Wahid Baloch, Sarah Zaman, Anita Panjani, Jugdesh Ahuja, Shireen Ajaz and others.
They said that laws and regulations governing demography should be revisited and reformed as per existing realities.
“The Sindh government is spending huge funds on Rangers, however, the paramilitary force has failed to play an effective role in averting the riots, which disturbed the city life and in many parts of the province for many days recently. The Sindh police should be strengthened and trained on how to deal with such situations,” they demanded.
The participants expressed serious concerns over the government’s ignorance to register, monitor and take action against illegal immigrants in the country. 
They said that Karachi was already overwhelmed with population influx, particularly from people of other provinces and even other countries. “The city’s socio-economic and civic infrastructure cannot withstand this unchecked tendency; hence steps should be taken to stop any further population influx in Sindh.”
They said that the ethnic realities of Sindh should be acknowledged and a proper dialogue initiated to find a just and lasting solution for peaceful coexistence. “Political parties should stop risking the ethnic balance of the province and particularly in Karachi at the cost of their electoral compromises.”
The meeting hailed the role of nationalist parties from both sides and also condemned the arrests of the Sindhi nationalists who were protesting against illegal Afghan immigrants in Sindh.
“There should be a distinction between people from other provinces who come as workers and those who are purchasing properties reportedly for strategic reasons,” the speakers said, calling upon the government to create a permanent platform where such problems could be immediately addressed.
The population census, particularly in Karachi, had remained a controversial issue. Since the government is planning to hold a census in Karachi, it should be done credibly and then a policy should be initiated to provide basic rights to the citizens. The PPP government in Sindh bears dual responsibility as a ruling party of Sindh as well as a major political party in the country, the meeting noted.
“We condemn the violence of all sorts and ask the government to take strict action against those disturbing peace,” the participants said.
They condemned the murder of Bilal Kaka and demanded those responsible be tried under the anti-terrorism law. 
The participants observed that several illegal immigrants had acquired computerised national identity cards (CNICs) in Karachi and there have been reports of the involvement of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) staff in issuing cards to foreigners. “A thorough investigation is required and government must ensure all such CNICs are cancelled.”

8,"Darkness, unfenced drain set death trap for young family in Karachi","On Sunday night, a family met with a tragic incident when their bike fell into open patch of an under-construction Shadman Nullah.","KARACHI: On Sunday night, a family met with a tragic incident when their bike fell into an open patch of an under-construction Shadman Nullah, leaving the mother dead and the infant son gone missing in the drain. 
The scenes at the site of the incident were heart-wrenching. 
The local residents, who themselves were weeping, were trying to console the man who lost his wife and the two-month-old son. 
When I reached at the spot, a huge crowd had gathered around the open patch of the nullah, which proved to be a death trap for the family. 

A day on from tragedy, search for missing infant still under way

The rescue servicemen and eyewitnesses told Dawn that a man along with his wife and two children — two-year-old daughter and two-month-old boy — was riding his bike and took a turn presuming the unfenced open drain to be a U-turn due to the darkness and fell into it. 
It is to be mentioned here that the people who commute on this road on daily basis know the fact that it is always dark here and streetlights do not function. 
This time in the moment of darkness, the man lost his wife and a son due to the collective failure of the stakeholders. 
Talking to Dawn, one of the witnesses said that it was around 8pm when the family fell in the open patch of the nullah. His little daughter was sitting on the petrol tank of the bike, and when they were falling in the drain, the father quickly grabbed her and tossed her to the road to save her life. 
Later, the people saved the man, but the woman and the son were drowned due to the high pressure of the water. 
The Chippa volunteers then reached at the spot and started searching for the missing woman and her minor son. The body of the woman was found after one-and-a-half-hours of efforts and was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. However, the rescue servicemen, even after more than 20 hours, were unable to find the son. 
Mr Nadeem, who was a relative of the family and also has a mechanic shop near the place of the incident, said that the family belonged to Orangi Town and they were going to attend a dinner feast near Shadman Town. 
The local residents of Shadman told Dawn that the patch was dug up months ago on the instructions of deputy commissioner of Central Taha Saleem to clear the nullah so that it does not overflow during the monsoon rains, but it was not closed or made secure by the authorities. 
However, DC Central Taha Saleem refuted the claim and said that the nullah was under-construction and was a part of an ongoing mega project worth Rs1 billion and that way why the drain had been excavated and ‘fenced’, but, he suspected that the fencing might have been swept away due to heavy flooding. 
“They [the aggrieved family] might not know about this because they are not the locals of the area,” he said speaking to Dawn. 
He added that the patch had now been covered to avoid any such incident again. 
This was not the first case of this nature. In this very monsoon spell, another bike rider also fell into the Shadman Nullah as the road was inundated with the rainwater and the fence was broken, but he was luckily immediately rescued by the people around. 
Women Development Minister Shehla Raza had also gone through a similar agony, when her two children — Aks-i-Batool, 13, and Shayan, 10 — had drowned when her car skidded off into an unfenced drain. Ms Raza also received injuries in the incident that happened in Nov, 2005.

11,Magistrate rules IO can’t let off suspects on basis of compromise in Nazim Jokhio case,"PPP MPA Jam Awais, nine others to face trial; court discharges MNA Karim due to ""insufficient evidence"".","KARACHI: A judicial magistrate has ruled that Pakistan Peoples Party lawmaker Jam Awais Bijar and his nine servants will face trial in a case pertaining to allegedly murdering Nazim Jokhio, facilitating the offence and concealing evidence.
Judicial Magistrate (Malir) Altaf Hussain Tunio, who pronounced the order on the final charge sheet submitted by the police in the case, held that “grounds exist to believe that offence is committed. Therefore, cognizance is taken on the report for the offences under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 365 (kidnapping), 506 (criminal intimidation), 109 (abetment) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.”
The magistrate sent the matter to the relevant sessions court for trial of the suspects.
He ruled that held MPA’s nine servants/guards — Haider, Meer Ali, Mairaj, Doda Khan, Muhammad Soomar, Niaz Salar, Ahmed Shoro, Zahid and Muhammad Saleem — will also stand trial.

PPP MPA, nine others to face trial; court discharges MNA Karim due to ‘insufficient evidence’

However, the judge discharged from the case MNA Jam Abdul Karim, the elder brother of Jam Awais, Abdul Razzaq, Muhammad Khan, Muhammad Ishaque, Atta Muhammad and Jamal due to ‘insufficient evidence’ against them.
In his written order issued on Monday, the judge noted that initially the police had booked five suspects, but in the interim charge sheet, the IO had shown MPA Awais, Meer Ali and Haider Ali in custody while Muhammad Mairaj, Jamal Ahmed and Abdul Razzaq were shown absconders.
He noted that subsequently suspect Ahmed Shoro, who was nominated in the FIR, was let off by the IO in the final report by placing his name in the column-II in blue ink due to insufficient evidence.
Further, the name of detained MPA Jam Awais was also placed in the column-II in blue ink in the third charge sheet submitted to an antiterrorism court, he added.
The judge noted that the IO had filed an interim charge sheet under Sections 302, 34, 365, 201 and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code, showing six suspects — MPA Jam Awais, Haider Ali, Meer Ali, Muhammad Mairaj, Jamal Ahmed alias Jamal Wahid and Abdul Razzaq in judicial custody, five suspects on pre-arrest bail and four suspects including MNA Karim as absconders.
During the course of investigation, the IO had deleted Sections 365 and 109 from the case.
The court noted that in the final charge sheet the IO left off/released 13 suspects including MPA Awais, MNA Jam Karim and others for want of evidence.
“Record showed that the IO in his report has not mentioned the facts and circumstances which warranted release/let off of accused from the charge. Further, perusal shows that accused Jam Awais was nominated in the FIR and the witnesses in their initial statements have also implicated him in the crime and his name was placed in the column-II of the interim and final charge sheets dated Oct 4 and Dec 10, 2021,” the magistrate stated.
“At this stage, I may add that it is settled now that the report of investigating officer under Section 173 CrPC is not binding upon the court and the court may agree or disagree with the report, submitted by the I/O. Subsequently, his [Jam Awais’s] name was placed in the third charge sheet with blue ink on the basis of affidavits given by the complainant [Muhammad Afzal Jokhio] as well as the deceased’s wife [Shirin] and on their further statements, forgiving the accused in the name of Allah Almighty,” the order said.
However, the magistrate ruled that since the accused had been let off on the basis of a compromise, “which is not the domain of the IO rather it is the domain/authority/competency of the trial court to effect compromise or otherwise. Hence, not agreeing with the report of the IO the accused, who have been let off by the IO despite their nomination in the FIR, they are all joined as accused in the crime and would stand/face the trial before the trial court,” the magistrate ruled.
