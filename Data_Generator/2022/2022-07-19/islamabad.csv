A cup of tea now costs Rs50 in many kiosks of the city. Price lists for tea, special tea, kahwa and other food items have also been printed for the customers.
In October, 2021 the cost of a cup of tea was increased from Rs30 to Rs40 due to the continuous rise in the price of loose tea, tea bags, milk, sugar and gas.
“Tea sellers should be allowed to increase the price of a cup of tea because its ingredients have become expensive,” said Abdul Aziz, a tea seller.
He said the price of milk had risen from Rs120 to Rs160 per litre, loose tea was available for Rs1,100 compared to its earlier price of Rs900 while a gas cylinder costs Rs3,000.
Mr Aziz said he could no longer make ends meet while selling a cup of tea for Rs40.
“In a single day, my total sale was Rs3,000 but when I calculated the profit, it came to only Rs50,” he said, adding that the purpose of a business was to earn profit, therefore, tea sellers had no choice but to increase the price of a cup of tea.

2,Decision on recounting of votes in PP-7 to be taken today after PTI challenges defeat,"Difference in votes between losing, winning candidates falls under prescribed threshold of 5pc of total votes, says application","ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Monday sought a recount of votes in PP-7 Rawalpindi-II, challenging the defeat of its candidate with a razor-thin margin, the returning officer (RO) concerned has called all the candidates to his office on Tuesday (today) for a decision on the plea. 
According to unofficial results, PML-N’s Raja Sagheer won the by-poll on the Punjab Assembly seat with a margin of just 49 votes defeating Mohammad Shabbir Awan of the PTI. The PTI also raised questions over the delayed announcement of the result in the constituency. 
Mr Awan in his application said the winning candidate received 68,906 votes while he secured 68,857 with the difference of just 49 votes. 
He argued in his application that the results in other constituencies across Punjab were announced at 7pm while PP-7’s result was shared quite late. 

Difference in votes between losing, winning candidates falls under prescribed threshold of 5pc of total votes, says application

The result transmission system is meant to transmit Form 45 - the statement of the count — from polling stations to the RO offices and the ECP secretariat using a smartphone. 
In addition, the difference in votes between him and the winning candidate “falls under the prescribed threshold of five per cent of total votes polled and 10,000 votes pursuant to Section 95 (5) of the Elections Act, 2017,” Mr Awan stated. 
Section 95(5) of the act reads: “Before commencement of the consolidation proceedings, the returning officer shall recount the ballot papers of one or more polling stations if a request or challenge in writing is made by a contesting candidate or his election agent and the margin of victory is less than five per cent of the total votes polled in the constituency or 10,000 votes, whichever is less…..”. Under a proviso in the section, the recount is to be made by the returning officer only once. 
The applicant said he had repeatedly made requests to allow him to be a part of the counting process but they were declined. 
Subsequently, the RO summoned all candidates to the election camp office in Kahuta at 11:30am on Tuesday for a decision. 
An ECP official, when contacted by Dawn, rejected as baseless reports that the RO had either rejected or refused to receive the PTI candidate’s application for a recount. 
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had set up 266 polling stations, comprising 787 polling booths, for 335,295 registered voters in the constituency. 
Six candidates contested the election in PP-7 which includes Kahuta and Kallar Syedan. 
The PML-N’s Raja Sagheer had earlier been elected on the PTI ticket in 2018 and was de-seated last month under Article 63-A for voting against party lines. 
Hafiz Mansoor of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) got 14,775votes, Raja Tanveer of Jamaat-i-Islami 1,666 and independent candidates Engineer Raja Nazakat Hussain 339 votes and Raja Wasim 3,084 votes.  
The turnout in the constituency remained 47.46pc, as 159,143 votes were polled - 75,987 females and 83,156 males. As many as 1,516 votes were rejected. 
In some polling stations, the PTI workers alleged that the ruling party candidate “bribed people through cash and flour.” However, the PML-N rejected the allegations. 
Former MNA and PTI spokesman Sadaqat Ali Abbasi told reporters that polling remained peaceful but the police and the ECP staff allegedly forced people to cast votes against the former ruling party. 
“By afternoon, the PTI supporters had come out in large numbers from Kahuta to cast vote in favour of Imran Khan’s candidate,” he said. 
Talking to media earlier in the day, PTI Punjab leader Fayyazul Hassan Chohan said the party had challenged the PP-7 by-poll result and expressed the hope the seat would be secured by his party after the recounting of votes. 
In 2018, both PML-N and PTI had lost the seat while Mr Sagheer, an independent candidate at the time, had won by bagging 44,363 votes. He subsequently joined the PTI government but left after Jehangir Khan Tareen parted ways with the former ruling party. 
“PML-N bigwig Raja Zafarul Haq’s son Raja Mohammad Ali used to contest the election on the PML-N ticket from Kahuta but this time the party decided to give the ticket to Mr Sagheer in return for his support to Hamza Shehbaz in the election for the chief minister.

4,Yasin Malik to go on hunger strike,He has been kept by the Indian government in solitary confinement since May 2019.,"MUZAFFARABAD: Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chairman Yasin Malik has decided to undergo an indefinite hunger strike from July 22 in New Delhi’s Tihar Jail.
This was stated in a press release issued by his special representative and JKLF chief spokesperson Rafiq Dar following a meeting of the organisation’s supreme council on Monday.
Mr Malik has been lodged by the Indian government in solitary confinement since May 2019, following denial of a fair trial and his physical presence in the court in connection with some fake cases.
According to the spokesperson, Mr Malik had actually decided to start the hunger strike from July 12 - a day before the last virtual court hearing – but had deferred it until July 22 on the request of Tihar jail authorities who wanted to get some time to take up his demands with their higher authorities and the government.
On July 13, during his online appearance from Tihar jail in Airforce case Mr Malik had informed the judge that he had written to Indian government that “if his just and legal demands for a fair trial and personal appearance in court to help him defend himself by cross-examining the witnesseswere not accepted he would be left with no option but to go for an indefinite hunger strike in the prison from July 22.”

RCCI President Nadeem Rauf demanded that emergency measures be taken to control the economic situation of the country as the dollar closed at Rs215 in the interbank trading.
The concern was expressed in a meeting of traders in the chamber house here on Monday.
Nadeem Rauif said that all political parties should put political issues aside and come up with a consensus document to address the economic situation of the country, including the IMF programme and the rupee downward slide.
In order to control the rupee depreciation, he said they would have to work towards the charter of economy and build a consensus so that the country could be brought out of the current economic crisis.
Group leader Sohail Altaf said if the uncertainty continues, more problems would arise and then nobody will be able to control the situation. 
He said an economically stable Pakistan would be independent in decision-making.

7,Sherry Rehman seeks reset of global climate agenda,"“We must hope for a better future, but hope is not a plan. Global pledges must go further,” she says.","ISLAMABAD: Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman on Monday advocated for changes to the global climate agenda, stressing that global pledges to mitigate the impacts of climate change must translate into planning and accessible funding pipelines to address the challenges faced by the developing world.
“We must hope for a better future, but hope is not a plan. Global pledges must go further, Ms Rehman said at a ministerial dialogue co-hosted by Germany and Egypt ahead of Conference of Parties 27 (COP27) in November this year in Cairo. The climate change minister sought a clear re-set of the global climate agenda before the crucial climate conference.
Ministry of Climate Change (MOCC) Secretary Asif Haider Shah, Senior Joint Secretary Mr Mujtaba, Director Dr Saima, and Climate Change Policy Specialist Sayyeda Hadika Jamshed accompanied the minister to the ministerial dialogue.
Speaking at the moot, Ms Rehman said: “We meet here today at a crucial inflection point in global negotiations on the pace and scale of climate change. Pakistan’s extreme vulnerability to accelerated climate-induced events has exposed it to a multitude of risks.”
These risks included unprecedented heatwaves, forest fires, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF), fast-approaching water scarcity — annual water availability level has fallen below 1,000 cubic meters — along with torrential monsoon flooding, growing desertification and a rise in sea levels, she added.
“All these changes have made Pakistan the ground zero of climate catastrophe where life on earth, water and underwater has been impacted at exponential levels, making the country a perfect example of all the disasters that come with climate stress,” the minister added.
“Damage to agricultural productivity, livelihoods, human health and economic stability have led to irreversible impacts, including massive internal displacements as well as GDP losses that go as high as 9.1pc (UNESCAP),” she said.
She said that mitigation was foundational to the earlier climate conference agendas, and Pakistan has attempted to meet its articulated ambitions. “What we have not seen until today at the multilateral level is a concerted acknowledgment of Loss and Damage as a core agenda,” she said, adding that Global South was looking for a robust financial mechanism to actualise its goals on the ground, where a transfer of resources goes beyond pledges and promises.
“In fact, it is troubling to countries like us that so far pledges for Loss and Damage compensation have also not been made at all,” Senator Rehman added.
She said that this was either an egregious oversight, or worse, an index of the climate injustice that was at play in a world where countries that emit less than 1 per cent of greenhouse gases were expected to not just fulfil their commitments on their own, but also make an unfinanced energy transition, or pledge to net zero goals without the means for implementation of such transformational shifts.
Furthermore, the senator said that notwithstanding mitigation, which is not a goal to be lost sight of, adaptation finance now also needed to be front and centre, with a serious scaling up of the financial envelope for the same at the COP27 agenda.
“If this does not become a key priority of the next conference of parties meeting, the sense that these agreements are removed from the ground reality that we face will only exacerbate the faultline of inequality between the Global South and the North.”
The climate change minister said there was a need to accelerate actions as well as the implementation of joint finance goals.

8,Indian nonagenarian filled with emotion as she returns to ancestral home after 75 years,She had been trying since 1965 to get a visa for Pakistan.,"When Indian citizen Reena Varma visits her childhood home in Pakistan this week for the first time in 75 years, she will be the only one from her family to make it back home since they left shortly before partition divided the two nations.
“My dream came true,” she said, adding her sister had died without ever being able to fulfil her wish to return to the home in the city of Rawalpindi they left when Varma was 15 years old.
The family of five siblings fled to the western Indian state of Pune shortly before partition in August 1947.
Although Varma was able to travel once to Lahore as a young woman, she has never been back to Rawalpindi. Her parents and siblings have since died. Crossing into Pakistan by road last week after decades of attempts to get a visa, she felt a wave of emotion.
“When I crossed the Pakistan-India border and saw the signs for Pakistan and India, I got sentimental,” she said, speaking during a stop in Lahore.
“Now, I cannot predict how I will react when I reach Rawalpindi and see my ancestral home in the street.”
Varma’s family was among the millions of people whose lives were disrupted after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947.
A mass migration followed, marred by violence and bloodshed, as about 15 million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs, fearing discrimination, swapped countries in a political upheaval that cost more than a million lives.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947, and relations remain tense, particularly over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which both claim in full.
August 14 will mark 75 years since partition split the two countries, dividing the province of Punjab roughly down the middle.
Varma remembers those tumultuous days clearly. The family worried as reports of violent incidents reached them and decided to leave, her father quitting his public servant job and Varma leaving her school.
“Initially we could not understand what happened,” she said, adding her mother never wanted to believe that the two countries had been divided.
“She kept saying we will go back to Rawalpindi soon, but ultimately she had to accept the reality that India and Pakistan are two separate countries,” she said.
Varma has been trying since 1965 to get a visa for Pakistan, finally succeeding this year when the Pakistan-India Heritage Club and Pakistan’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar helped with the process.
Varma is being hosted by Imran William, the director of the India-Pakistan Heritage Club, which works to highlight the shared heritage of citizens on both sides of the border and reunite family members separated by partition.
“India and Pakistan are two separate countries but we can bring peace between them through love and people-to-people contact,” William said.
When Varma, who is Hindu, was leaving India for her trip she said many warned her not to travel to the Muslim-majority country, but she was not deterred. “Here I feel I am in my own town with my own people,” she said.

9,CDA board approves FWO’s bid for expansion of expressway,Project will be completed in 18 months; summary for procurement of 20 metro buses approved,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) board on Monday approved the bid of Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) for expansion of the expressway from PWD to Grand Trunk (G.T.) Road.
The CDA board, which met here with CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed in the chair, discussed various matters including the bid worth around Rs11 billion of the FWO for expanding 7 kilometres of the expressway from existing two to four lanes including expansion of Sohan Bridge. Sources said most of board members attended the meeting online.
The expansion project, once started, will be completed in 18 months. Recently, the CDA board gave a go-ahead to the civic body to execute the project through a government contractor under 42(F) Rules of the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA), which allows government-owned organisations to directly contract with other state-owned entities.
CDA had called bids from government firms. Both National Logistics Cell (NLC) and FWO participated in the process; NLC quoted Rs11.7 billion while FWO quoted Rs10.9 billion. Therefore, CDA accepted FWO’s bid as it was lower than that of NLC.

Project will be completed in 18 months; summary for procurement of 20 metro buses approved

According to CDA officials, the civic agency had already built several interchanges on the expressway and carried out interventions to ensure smooth flow of traffic, but they had not been of much use. They said there was no other option but to expand the busy road till G.T. Road to resolve the lingering traffic issue.
The road, which starts from Faisal Mosque, has already been widened till Koral and PWD stop. However, after PWD, traffic gets congested all of a sudden because the road from this point onwards narrows down to two lanes.
Presently, the FWO is executing another project under which a portion of the road (2kms) from Korang Bridge to PWD is being widened.
The said road caters to both local and heavy traffic, particularly plying between Islamabad and Lahore. It is also an important link between Punjab, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as it is connected with G.T. Road at Rawat.
Procurement of buses
The CDA board in principle also approved a summary of the civic agency for procuring 20 more metro buses from any government organisation.
These buses will be plied on the Green and Blue Line metro routes in place of existing buses, which are originally meant for the Orange Line metro bus service from Peshawar Mor to Airport, but temporarily being run on the said two routes.
An official of CDA said in the future, CDA will have to procure more buses for both routes as a large number of people have been using the Green and Blue Line services.
