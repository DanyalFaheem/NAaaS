They also hurled stones at the local grid station.
A woman councillor, Wagma Afridi led the protesters. She along with a sizeable number of tribeswomen came out of their homes and established a protest camp on the road alongside male councillors and tribesmen.
Speaking on the occasion, Ms Afridi alleged the local grid station officials subjected them to nearly 22 hours of loadshedding, which also caused water shortage in the area. She said the power supply company had earlier reached an agreement with the tribesmen that only scheduled loadshedding would be carried out on the pattern of Peshawar and other cities. She said the agreement was reached after the tribesmen had donated land for the grid station.
She alleged the grid station staff had not only backtracked on the agreement but was unlawfully providing electricity to local iron ores and stone crushing plants.
The councillor said though it was against tribal traditions that women came out on roads, but sizzling heat, acute shortage of water and other related issues caused by unscheduled power outage compelled them to do so. The protesters ended the road blockage after seven hours when local grid station staffers assured them of curtailing the duration of outages.

2,"PTI lawmakers demand CEC’s resignation, general elections after Punjab victory",Opposition praises election commissioner over ‘free and fair’ polls,"PESHAWAR: Celebrating their party’s stunning victory in the Punjab by-elections, the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s members in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Monday demanded the chief election commissioner’s resignation and free and fair elections in the country.
The opposition lawmakers, however, blasted the treasury members for their ‘bias’ against the CEC and eulogised the Election Commission of Pakistan for what they called conducting transparent and peaceful elections in the Punjab province.
The government had called the session, which was chaired by Deputy Speaker Mahmood Jan.
After recitation from the Holy Quran, the chair administered oath to newly-elected PTI MPA from PK-7 Swat, Haji Fazal Maula.

Opposition praises election commissioner over ‘free and fair’ polls

The seat had fallen vacant after the death of Awami National Party member Waqar Ahmad Khan.
The PTI lawmakers said the ‘brave people of Punjab rejected the imported federal government and mafia’ by ballot paper and that only fresh elections could steer the country out of the prevailing political and economic turmoil.
“The by-elections in Punjab were a battle between truth and falsehood, and this is the beginning of a new era in Pakistan,” higher education minister Kamran Khan Bangash told the house.
He said the people of Punjab accepted the narrative of PTI chairman Imran Khan by rejecting the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in the by-polls.
Mr Bangash said the CEC should resign immediately in order to pave the way for holding free and fair elections in the country.
“At least the chief election commissioner should quit. The PTI will no longer accept him,” he said.
The minister said despite the ‘partisan’ role of the ECP, the PTI emerged victorious in the Punjab by-elections.
He said Article 19 of the Constitution was violated by the Punjab government by banning the entry of the people of KP to the province during by-polls.
Mr Bangash said the PTI would secure two-thirds majority in the next general elections and Imran Khan would become the prime minister yet again.
Labour minister Shaukat Ali Yousafzai said the ‘imported’ government in the centre had been confined to the federal territory and fresh elections were the only solution in the current situation.
He said the PTI’s electoral triumph had proved that an imported government had been installed in the centre.
Mr Yousafzai said he saluted the people of Punjab for rejecting an imported regime.
Housing minister Amjad Ali Khan said the ‘imported’ government had lost its moral authority to continue after people of Punjab gave a fresh mandate to the PTI.
The opposition members rejected allegations against the CEC and insisted that the ECP had performed a commendable job in the by-elections by proving its impartiality and neutrality.
Awami National Party member Sardar Hussain Babak asked the ruling MPAs to show political sagacity and maturity.
He said the PML-N had accepted its defeat in elections, which was a positive and bold gesture in the country’s political history.
“I wonder why our PTI colleagues are angry whether they win or lose. Please show positivity and celebrate your victory,” he said urging political parties to promote tolerance and respect for others.
Pakistan Peoples Party member Night Yasmin Orakzai the appreciated the ECP for conducting ‘peaceful and fair’ elections in Punjab and said neither returning officers nor the security establishment interfered with the electoral process.
She said former PM Imran Khan copied PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz’s narrative during his election campaign but he was not booked for it, while cases were registered against Maryam. Mr Orakzai claimed that the PTI’s lawmakers from KP ran campaign for their party’s candidates in Punjab.
She said next elections would be held on time next year.
Other members of the opposition also praised the PML-N leadership for ‘having a big heart to accept poll results’.
The lawmakers didn’t finish discussion on a resolution by PTI MPA Abdul Salam regarding victimisation of Pakhtuns and attacks on their properties in Sindh after the opposition pointed out a lack of quorum.
The resolution said the federal government should ask the Sindh government to ensure safety of Pakhtuns in Karachi and other areas of the province, while political forces, including nationalist parties in Sindh, should play their positive role to defuse ethnic tensions in the province.

7,Peshawar High Court stops NAB from reopening four cases against govt,"Seeks response of bureau, PAC on orders for fresh probe.","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Monday issued a stay order stopping the National Accountability Bureau from reopening four cases of alleged corruption and irregularities against the provincial government on the orders of the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
After preliminary hearing into the petition of three relevant officials against the PAC’s directives to the NAB, a bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Shahid Khan also issued notices to the PAC chairman, National Assembly secretary, NAB chairman and other respondents seeking their separate responses to the petition and adjourned proceedings in the case until Aug 4.
The petition is jointly filed by former BRT director (coordination) Alamzeb Khan, Bank of Khyber executive vice-president Sher Mohammad and former managing director of the Tourism Corporation of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mushtaq Khan.
The petitioners requested the court to declare illegal and without jurisdiction the PAC’s directives contained in the minutes of its July 7, 2022, meeting for the NAB chairman and its Peshawar regional headquarters for re-investigating cases regarding the launch of the BRT, Malam Jabba land lease, BOK appointments and Billion Tree Tsunami Project (BTTP).

Seeks response of bureau, PAC on orders for fresh probe

They sought the court’s orders to strike down those PAC directions and permanently stop the NAB from ‘acting upon any such directions so issued by the PAC’.
The PAC, in a meeting on July 7, had directed the acting NAB chairman to reopen the four cases and file a report to it within three months. It had also directed the NAB to file a reference in the Malam Jabba lease case within a month.
The counsel for petitioners, Qazi Jawad Ahsanullah, contended that the PAC’s mandate and jurisdiction had been specified in the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business of the National Assembly, 2007, whereby the committee had nothing to do with the ‘administration of criminal justice and offences related to corruption’.
He said under rules 203 and 205, the role and functions of the PAC appeared to be limited to the matters concerning public exchequer and report of the Auditor General of Pakistan on issues concerning public money.
The lawyer said during the last few years, the NAB and its regional headquarters in Peshawar had been inquiring and investigating various cases regarding petitioners and their organisations, including the four cases in question.
He said the NAB investigation officers had seized all official records of the cases, while senior officials of the provincial government remained involved in the investigation.
The counsel said the NAB had conducted a thorough probe into the matters related to the Malam Jabba land lease for a skiing resort and didn’t find any corruption and corrupt practices, so the matter was placed before the NAB executive board for deliberation.
He added that as per the law’s requirement, a formal application was submitted to the accountability court by the NAB regional office and that the court examined records, including the report of the IO, and allowed the closure of investigation on Nov 2, 2021.
About BOK appointments, Mr Jawad said the matter was referred to the NAB headquarters but in the meanwhile, certain amendments were made to the National Accountability Ordinance, which had necessitated the filing of a petition in the high court with the prayer that the recent amendments had clearly ‘ousted’ the jurisdiction of the bureau in that particular matter.
He added that the matter was sub judice and it was most likely that the NAB would concede to the settled legal position.
The lawyer contended that PAC chairman Noor Alam Khan was proceeding to order re-investigation into the cases based on personal and political vendetta and without genuine grounds. He added that the PAC chairman was also an accused in a NAB case about his assets.

They said that the irrigation channel and the power plant were damaged by flood about one week ago after which more than 250 households plunged into darkness. They said that they sought help of local lawmaker and district administration, but in vain.
“When the flood hit our area and washed away our power plant and the irrigation channel, we contacted our MPA and the relevant departments but they paid no heed to our issue,” said Engineer Saeed, a resident of Churat village. He added that despite several attempts, neither the local MPA nor the district administration helped them.
He said that supply of electricity suspended to about 250 houses in the area when the power plant was damaged by flood. “This is a tourist spot. These days hundreds of tourists from across the country are here but we do not have electricity due to which not only the local residents face problems but it has also badly affected the tourism sector in the area,” he added.
The local residents said that most of the agriculture in the area was dependent on the irrigation channel. They said that they could irrigate their fields after the flood damaged the irrigation channel.
“Our area is famous for producing high quality vegetables including potato, turnip, cabbages, peas, onion and others. So, the collapse of the irrigation channels left the farmers at the mercy of God,” said, Rahimullah, a resident of the area.
He said that the locals started collecting donations when they the elected representatives and district administration disappointed them. H added that each household contributed Rs1,000 to reconstruct the irrigation channel as well as the power plant.
