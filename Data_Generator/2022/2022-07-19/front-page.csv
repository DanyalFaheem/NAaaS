0,Undeterred coalition resolves not to rush into election,"PML-N, PPP hold separate meetings, agree to complete term; PM has invited allies today to discuss option of fresh polls.","• ‘N’, PPP hold separate meetings, agree to complete term and go to polls after fixing economy, making election reforms
• Nawaz speaks to PDM heads; Shehbaz invites chiefs of all coalition partners to join heads for post-by-poll strategy
LAHORE / KARACHI: Amid the opposition Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) fresh demand for early general elections after registering a thumping victory in the crucial Punjab by-elections on Sunday, the two main component parties of the ruling coalition — the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakis­tan Peoples Party (PPP) — on Monday insisted the Nat­ional Assembly will complete its term until mid-next year, and general elections be held after the government carries out electoral reforms and fixes the economy.
Nonetheless, for some introspection in the wake of the humiliating defeat his party faced at the hands of the PTI in the by-polls, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited the leadership of all coalition parties to Lahore on Tuesday (today) to discuss the option of fresh polls.
However, after a meeting of PML-N stalwarts in Model Town, Lahore, presided over by PM Shehbaz, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah did hint that the party would stick to its stance of going to polls after completing the incumbent assembly’s tenure in August 2023.
“A decision to hold early elections will be made in consultation with all allied parties. However, the PML-N’s point of view hasn’t changed — next elections should be held after completion of the government’s tenure,” the minister told a press conference on Monday.
Mr Sanaullah and fellow federal minister Mian Javed Latif have both said their party might consider fresh polls, provided PTI chief Imran Khan dissolved the Punjab and KP assemblies. Sanaullah also voiced the government’s support for the election commission members in the face of Imran’s onslaught on them.
Moreover, Information Minister Marriyum Aurang­zeb said on the invitation of the premier, a meeting of the Pakistan Democratic Movement and allied parties would be held on Tuesday (today) at Mr Sharif’s Lahore residence. “The leadership of these parties will deliberate on important and national issues,” she said in a statement. PML-N-chief Nawaz Sharif will join the meeting through a video link from London.
A party source said neither the PML-N nor its two main coalition partners – PPP and JUI-F – were willing to concede to the early election demand of Imran Khan. “The PTI chairman may be offered to hold talks over the matter, but the coalition government will take the decision that suits it,” he said.

He further said that at this point, giving in to Khan’s demand meant allowing the PTI to return to power as its chief’s popularity graph was on a constant rise and the Punjab by-poll results were evident of it. “Besides, the ruling coalition has yet to fix the economy, a major reason it cited for coming to power after toppling Khan’s government in April, and carry out election reforms. Until it meets these goals, the ruling coalition may not agree to snap polls,” he said.
During the party meeting, the prime minister was briefed about the reasons for the PML-N’s defeat on 15 of the 20 seats of Punjab Assembly in the by-polls. “Awarding tickets to PTI defectors that left PML-N workers disgruntled and disinterested in the election campaign, unpopular decisions of the coalition government of making huge increases in petroleum and electricity prices, rising inflation and related matters were the main reasons cited for the defeat,” a PML-N leader told Dawn.
Mission: Save Hamza
PM Shehbaz and his party leaders also discussed possible measures to save Hamza Shehbaz’s office of the chief minister. The incumbent CM is certain to lose to PTI-PML-Q joint candidate Chaudhry Parvez Elahi after failing to win 11 seats to achieve a majority in the house where the joint opposition now has 188 members.
“We will not let Mr Elahi become the CM easily. If five to seven PTI lawmakers don’t come to the assembly on the voting day (July 22), how will the PTI have its chief minister?” Sanaullah questioned.
Reportedly, the PML-N has been working on either ‘detaining’ a few PTI lawmakers in different cases or luring some of them with lucrative packages to abstain from voting.
Nawaz, Zardari, Fazl discussion
The ruling coalition elders – PML-N’s Nawaz Sharif, PPP’s Asif Zardari and JUI-F’s Maulana Fazlur Rehman – spoke to each other separately over the phone and discussed the situation post the PTI victory.
According to a source, the trio agreed that any decision about early general elections would be taken in consultation with all allied parties. “They were of the view that the coalition government of nine parties should take no such decision in haste or under Imran’s pressure,” he maintained.
PPP CEC meeting
Meanwhile, over in Karachi, the PML-N’s main coalition ally, the PPP, insisted on completion of the National Assembly’s term for “crucial electoral reforms and constitutional amendments”, vowing “to stand with the allies in these testing times”.
The party’s fresh resolve came at its central executive committee (CEC) meeting chaired by PPP chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari where senior leaders discussed the emerging political situation, and performance of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government so far. They also shared their thoughts about the party’s future strategy and plan to reactivate itself in Punjab where the PTI had regained its ground and stunned the PML-N in its stronghold.
Sources privy to the discussion said the participants were almost consensual that the PPP should not support early elections, as being demanded by the PTI. The meeting, which lasted for more than two hours, also approved the decision to attend Tuesday’s meeting in Lahore of leaders of the federal government’s allies with a clear opinion about the current assembly’s term.
“The PPP is very clear that this [National] assembly should complete its term,” said Sindh information minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, who’s also the PPP’s CEC member, while talking to reporters after the meeting outside Bilawal House. “We want this, so parliament can make crucial constitutional amendments and undertake electoral reforms. Once they are done and the assembly completes its term, we will definitely want free and fair elections.”
He further said the PPP had a history of loyalty towards its allies, and the recent political setback to its coalition partner in Punjab won’t affect its partnership with any of the allied parties. The PPP would support any decision taken consensually by the coalition.
“We never betray our allies,” said Mr Memon. “Whatever the results of Punjab by-polls are, we stand with our allies. We also believe that any political challenge can be met with unity and harmony among the saner political entities. The Punjab by-polls have also exposed all the lies of [PTI chairman] Imran Khan. He should apologise to the chief election commissioner for leading a propaganda campaign against him.”

1,Imran wants CEC gone,"Imran says PTI's by-poll win clear message to those who attempt to steal public mandate, “take decisions ... behind closed doors”.","• PTI chief says country’s ‘biggest political party’ doesn’t trust ECP chief
• Terms general elections only way out of political crisis
• PTI nominates Elahi for Punjab CM
ISLAMABAD: A day after his party’s resounding victory in the by-elections held in 20 constituencies of Punjab, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan demanded snap polls to end the political turmoil in the country, while also calling for the resignation of Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, saying that the “the biggest party of Pakistan [PTI] does not trust” the head of the commssion.
In his address to celebrate the party’s victory on 15 out of 20 seats, the former prime minister targeted the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and its chief. He said the CEC was “incompetent” and “dishonest” and reiterated the allegation that he had joined hands with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).
“We don’t trust the ECP head and he has been imposed on us,” Mr Khan said. “We don’t have confidence in you. … you are a biased person in cahoots with a political party,” he said while addressing the CEC.
Mr Khan also alluded to “eight separate cases” wherein the ECP had “ruled against the PTI before its decisions were overruled by the courts”. He added that the ECP chief had only acted against the PTI and referred to Daska by-elections to corroborate his claim.
“ECP did not take action against [PPP leader] Yousuf Raza Gilani’s son, who bribed people [during Senate election], and remained mum over the use of money in Senate elections. In Sindh, violations were reported during the local bodies election but ECP did not react,” the former premier added.
Mr Khan, in spite of the massive win, expressed reservations over the alleged use of state machinery to manipulate elections on July 17. He added that police and local administration harassed PTI candidates and supporters in the run-up to polls. “[During the by-polls] they used all the tactics to defeat us. Police threatened our people. Officers acted as workers of PML-N,” he claimed, adding that Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz had no right to use the police in such a way.
Mr Khan added if future elections were conducted the way Punjab by-elections were held on Sunday then that would further exacerbate the political crisis. “The election held in Punjab will not address the issues [despite clean sweep by PTI] because only general elections can bring economic and political stability in Pakistan,” Imran Khan claimed.
‘Public mandate cannot be stolen’
The PTI chief referred to his thumping victory and said it was a clear message to those who attempt to steal public mandate and “take decisions about the future of Pakistan behind closed doors”. “They should not remain mistaken [anymore],” he added.
According to Mr Khan, people did not come out in droves to take part in the by-polls as he attributed their “zeal” to his party’s drive for ‘real freedom’.
Mr Khan, who was sent packing following a no-trust vote in parliament earlier this year, alleged that an “artificial political crisis” was created in the country even though Pakistan was progressing after 17 years and most economic indicators were positive.
Meanwhile, the PTI’s core committee nominated Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as the candidate for the office of chief minister of Punjab. The meeting was chaired by PTI chairman Imran Khan and attended by senior leaders of party.

2,Wedding party meets tragedy as river claims at least 21 lives near Machka in Punjab,Victims were among wedding guests on a boat that capsized in Indus River; official says over 80 passengers rescued.,"

(Clockwise): Officials conduct a rescue operation to save lives and retrieve bodies after a boat carrying more than 100 passengers capsized in the Indus River, near the town of Sadiqabad in Punjab’s Rahim Yar Khan district, on Monday. At least 19 women and two children drowned. People of Sindh’s Ubauro area earlier tried to rescue the drowning families, several of them belonging to the Solangi clan.—Dawn / PPI

 
RAHIM YAR KHAN: At least 19 women and two children drowned while several others went missing after a boat carrying more than 100 wedding guests capsized in the Indus River near Machka police limits, some 65km from here, on Monday.
More than 100 participants of a Solangi clan marriage party were coming back from union council Khrore — in the riverbed area of tehsil Rojhan in district Rajanpur — to Hussain Bakhash Solangi village in Machka UC of Sadiqabad when the boat capsized, apparently due to overloading and high tide.
According to Rescue 1122 sources, they received a call from the Machka police station house officer that a boat carrying over 100 passengers had capsized.
A handout said that 90 passengers were rescued by locals and the district administration while 19 women and two children’s bodies were also recovered.
RYK Deputy Commissioner Syed Musa Raza told Dawn that more than 80 passengers were rescued, 19 bodies of women passengers recovered and search was in progress for the remaining missing people.
He said 35 divers of Rescue 1122 were taking part in the search operation with the help of local divers.
The Rescue 1122 statement said their personnel immediately reached the spot with five ambulances, water rescue van and 30 rescuers.
However, Sadiqabad Assistant Commissioner Saleem Asai put the death toll at 23, including 19 women and four children.
Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz has ordered the district administration to speed up the rescue operation.
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah have directed the administration of Kashmore district — Sindh’s nearest area to Sadiqabad — to provide all possible assistance in the search operation and use the services of divers from Pakistan Navy in case of need.
According to Rescue in-charge, the operation was stopped due to darkness and will resume on Tuesday morning.
Machka is known as an area of Mazari Sardars. According to some locals, more than 150 passengers on two boats were on their way for a wedding ceremony and both boats were moving against the tide. One boat was overloaded and the boatman could not control the balance and it overturned.
The groom Shehzad, along with his mother were among the passengers who were rescued by the residents.
The locals said residents of the riverine area have relatives across the river and they have been using boats for transportation for the last many years because the bridges on the Indus at Guddu and Bangla Ichha were quite a long way from their area.
They said the wedding party was crossing the Indus strip from this location because it was considered safe. The neighbouring areas are notorious for gangsters who kidnap people for ransom.
Police spokesperson Saif Ali Wains told Dawn that initially, a Machka team reached the spot and rescued more than 45 passengers with the help of locals. He said initial information about the incident was received quite late because the site was in the middle of the river and there was no cell phone reception in the area.
APP reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his deep grief over the loss of precious lives. In a statement via his Twitter handle, the prime minister prayed for the departed souls.

3,"Citizens asked to shun conspiracies on vaccination, family planning","Health minister says some elements trying to create impression that family planning, vaccination aren't compatible with religion.","ISLAMABAD: Federal Min­ister for National Hea­lth Services (NHS) Abdul Qadir Patel on Monday deplored that some elements were trying to create the impression that the concepts of family planning and vaccination — against polio and Covid-19 — are not compatible with religion.
Terming it “very dangerous behaviour”, he said that on the issue of population welfare, the government had the support of religious scholars from all sects.
Addressing a seminar held in connection with Wor­ld Population Day, he said all stakeholders were wor­king together to bring the population under control.
He said that polio workers, who get around Rs1,000 per day to vaccinate child­ren and save them from a life­time of disability, were killed and to date around 60 workers have laid down their lives in the line of duty.
Sharing from his personal experiences, Mr Patel said that while the Covid-19 vaccine was being administered freely, many people were shy to get vaccinated.
“In my neighbourhood, someone refused to get vaccinated after which a doctor contacted me to convince that individual. I went to that person, who was 73 years old, and tried to convince him that he should get vaccinated. But his concern was that after getting the vaccine, he may not be able to have children,” he said.
Although no one has been able to substantiate claims that Covid-19 vaccines have an adverse impact on reproductive health, such conspiracy theories abound on social media and impressionable people are often taken in by them.
Speaking at the event, the health minister offered up his own logic; he said that people should understand that the ministry did not want to reduce the number of Muslims, rather it was trying to improve the health, quality of life and education of Muslims living in Pakistan.
“People should understand that they are living in a country where Muslims are already in majority. If they (Muslims) would have been in minority, there could have been a justification to increase the population,” he said.
He warned that the country’s population was set to swell to 285-300 million by the end of the year 2030.
“It is an alarming situation and there is a need to impart awareness among the masses that Islam does not stop them from population welfare. There is a need to mentally prepare people to accept that such steps are being taken for their benefit,” he said.
The minister prayed that people would understand that population welfare was in their interest and they would stop considering it a foreign agenda or conspiracy.

4,Barrick Gold seeks legal cover for Reko Diq deal,"Canadian firm expects parliament, SC to sanctify $6bn out-of-court settlement to pave the way for $7bn investment in Reko Diq.","ISLAMABAD: Canadian mining firm Barrick Gold Corporation expects Pakistani parliament and the Supreme Court to sanctify its $6 billion out-of-court settlement on international arbitration to pave the way for $7bn investment in Reko Diq copper and gold project development in Balochistan.
“For stability of agreement, it is important that the Supreme Court of Pakistan review it [settlement] and parliament endorse it through legislation,” said Mark Bristow, the president and chief executive officer of Barrick Gold Corporation, at a news conference here on Monday after a meeting with Finance Minister Miftah Ismail.
Mr Bristow argued the legal protection for Barrick was not Reko Diq-specific only, but also a kind of security for future investment in the mining sector. He said the apex court’s review and parliament’s endorsement got delayed due to a change in government, but all stakeholders were working on that to move forward.
This is the first time that the demand for support from the major state institutions — parliament and the judiciary — has come to light for a commercial agreement on settlement of the arbitration award against Pakistan by World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).

Canadian firm’s chief, Miftah discuss investment in copper-gold project

The Supreme Court had in 2013 declared null and void the Reko Diq development lease, signed with Barrick Gold and Chilean firm Antofagasta during the Musharraf regime.
Mr Bristow said World Bank’s commercial arm — International Finance Corporation (IFC) — would be joining the upcoming joint venture with Barrick. He said the joint venture would be arranging about $4bn for the project development and about $2bn was expected to come from consortium partners, particularly the IFC and some other international export and import institutions of the leading economies for equipment, plants and expertise supplies.
He did not see any problem in implementation of the settlement and future development of the project, saying the agreement was signed in the previous regime and the new government was working for its implementation seamlessly, which meant all see its benefits for the people of Pakistan, particularly Balochistan. Likewise, the company has been working with the former and incumbent chief minister of Balochistan.
This was reinforced separately by Finance Minister Ismail after his meeting with Barrick’s chief. “We are looking forward to Barrick Gold’s investment in the copper and gold mine in Pakistan. Mark Bristow has a very enlightened vision for this mine, and I believe this investment is going to be transformational for Balochistan and Pakistan,” he said in a tweet.

 





 
The consortium of Barrick Gold and Antofagasta reached an agreement with the government in March this year for the settlement of ICSID’s award against Pakistan. Barrick decided to become a 50 per cent partner with the governments of Pakistan and Balochistan and state-owned entities in the Reko Diq gold and copper mining project in Balochistan, while the Chilean firm exited the contract in exchange for $900 million by Pakistani shareholders.
Now Barrick and Pakistan hold 50pc shareholding in the Reko Diq project. Of the 50pc Pakistan share, state-owned entities — OGDCL and Pakistan Petroleum Limited — jointly hold 25pc shares, while Balochistan has 15pc stakes in the special purpose vehicle to be funded by the federal government and 10pc on a free-carried basis.
Barrick will be the project operator that will get a mining lease, exploration licence, surface rights and a mineral agreement stabilising the fiscal and investment regime for a period of 40 years (extendable).
Mr Bristow said the company was working with the current government for the legal framework and desired legislation pertaining to the transaction. “We want a partnership framework that complies with the law,” he said, adding that total transparency was desired in the project’s execution.
Additionally, the company wanted a long-term stability with Pakistan. “We had been fighting for a long time and decided to find a way to execute the Reko Diq gold project because the conflict was bad for all parties,” he said, adding that it would attract additional investment in the region.
He said the consortium had an extensive history of working with the IFC, which managed private banks. They were negotiating with the IFC and export-import banks for a $4bn debt comprising 50pc of the total debt. And $2bn will be secured by the project’s consortium.
Mr Bristow said the project was expected to attract $10bn investment that included $4bn in the first phase, $3bn in the second phase and roughly $3bn at a later stage.
Responding to a question, he said the establishment of a copper and gold refinery in Pakistan to process the project’s raw materials was not feasible at this stage because it was viable above one million tonnes while production from Reko Diq would be around 200,000 tonnes in the first phase and 400,000 tonnes in the second phase.
About the security situation in Balochistan, he said Barrick had worked in conflict-ridden regions, including in Africa and elsewhere, and devised its own strategy for project execution.
The project is expected to come into production in 2027-28 and provide jobs to 7,500 people during construction and 4,000 during the operation phase.

5,"Around 100 embark for K2 summit, six scale Broad Peak","Sources say 250 climbers will be in action at K2 this summer, while 150 have abandoned attempts to push for summit.","

NEPALESE climbers hold puja at base camp before setting off.—Dawn

 
GILGIT: At least one hundred climbers from multiple expeditions on Monday began their push for the K2 summit, to take advantage of weather conditions that are likely to remain clear until July 22.
Meanwhile, six climbers managed to scale Broad Peak as several foreigners started their push to reach on top of the peak which is 8,051m high.
Sources at base camp told Dawn that climbers were taking advantage of the clear weather window
Before their departure to higher camps, a puja ceremony was held at the base camp by Nepalese climbers who prayed for their safety during the ascent and descent from the summit. “This is first summit push this season … team members have already fixed ropes from base camp to Camp 3 … [have] deposited oxygen, and stocked tents with food,” the sources added.
Sakhawat Hussain from Summit Karakoram told Dawn that 10 climbers from the Pioneer Adventure team, 23 climbers from the 8K Expeditions team, three climbers from the Dolma team, and four climbers from the Makalu Extreme team started the summit push on Monday. Climbers from Elite Expeditions, Imagine Nepal, Seven Summits Treks, and Adventure Pakistan also started their summit push.
Base camp sources told Dawn that 250 total climbers would be in action at K2 this summer, while 150 climbers had abandoned their attempts to push for the summit.
Mingma G, the expedition leader of Imagine Nepal team, said that K2 gives a limited weather window and they wou­ld depart for the K2 summit push on Mon­day. “None of our Sherpa and members went above Camp 2 and we were supposed to set up our Camp 3 before summit push but I am here with my best team and we don’t give up anything easily,” he said in a statement on social media.
“We have Rene Dai from Netherlands who is 65 years and trying [to scale] K2 for the fifth time and he alone is enough to inspire us towards our goal. I will have a picture with him on the summit,” Mingma G said.
Another Imagine Nepal team will depart for the Broad Peak push, said the climber as he hoped to see his team reach the summit on July 20.
According to a statement by 8K Exp­e­d­itions, their team will be heading to Camp 2 and hopefully summit by July 21.
Sakhawat Hussain confirmed to Dawn that six climbers, including two from his company, summited the peak at 2pm on Monday. Luc Benoit from Can­a­da and Louis from Bolivia were among the six climbers who reached the top. The names of the other four summiteers could not be known till the filing of this report.
Meanwhile, other expedition teams also started their efforts to summit Broad Peak and Gasherbrum-II. Pakis­tani climber Sajid Ali Sadpara, who started his Broad Peak summit, had also reached Camp 2 by Monday evening.
