The house then discussed the ongoing constitutional crisis in the country as ex-minister Raja Basharat said the July 22 contest for the office of chief minister would be continuation of the April 16 electoral exercise.

Parvez terms PTI win biggest surprise after ZAB’s 1971 victory

He criticised the bureaucracy for, what he said, mistreating the PTI lawmakers and workers, adding that the officials were servants of the state, and not of any individual.
MPA Yawar Abbas Bukhari said the bureaucrats were enjoying a luxurious life at the expense of the taxpayers and needed to be reined in.
Chaudhry Zaheer said the PTI fought an 11-party alliance in the by-polls, but sincere struggle ensured its success.
Samiullah Chaudhry regretted that the federal government was planning trial of Imran Khan under Article 6 of the Constitution, adding that it wanted to punish PTI chief for creating awareness among the masses.
Later, the proceedings were postponed for Tuesday afternoon.  
Meanwhile, Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi has said the by-election success is the biggest surprise given by Imran Khan in the country’s political history after Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s landslide win in 1971 elections.
Mr Elahi said this while chairing a joint parliamentary party meeting of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and PML-Q at assembly chambers here on Monday.  
“The election results are a victory of Imran Khan’s narrative and the truth won in the by-polls,” Mr Elahi said.  
The meeting paid tribute to PTI chairman Imran Khan for PTI’s success in the by-elections.Mr Elahi said Imran Khan had conveyed his message to the masses by running a vigorous election campaign and people responded to his voice and rejected those who changed their loyalties.
The speaker said the PML-N indiscriminately used police in the by-elections, but the PTI and the PML-Q workers played their role without caring for their lives.  
“The law will make its course against those who resorted to illegal actions,” he asserted.
The MPAs of both parties also expressed their opinions during the meeting.

5,"Panel to assess viability of Ruda, business district projects in Lahore","""PML-N government wants to scrutinise them (the projects) in depth to avert any problem in future,"" says a source.","LAHORE: In a bid to review the functionality and progress of the Ravi Urban Development Authority (Ruda) and the Lahore Central Business District Development Authority (LCBDDA), the government has constituted a high-level committee headed by the Planning and Development Board chairman.
Since both the authorities are engaged in executing the two mega schemes, the core objective behind reviewing these projects is to assess their viability, scope and any intervention (if required) on the part of the government.
“Actually these two projects were launched during the PTI-led Punjab government tenure. Therefore, the sitting PML-N government wants to scrutinise them in depth to avert any problem in future since huge investments in various sectors of these projects are involved,” an official source in the Punjab government told Dawn. 
According to a notification issued by the government recently, the committee consists of 11 members including P & D Board chairman (convener), Board of Revenue member (consolidation), secretaries for law & parliamentary affairs, irrigation, local government and community development, housing, urban development and public health engineering and environment protection departments, Lahore commissioner, LDA director General, chief executive officer (urban unit) and CEO (Ruda/LCBDDA).
The Ruda and LCBDDA CEO would also act as secretary of the committee. Under the detailed Terms of Reference (ToRs), the committee has been assigned to review master plans of Ruda and LCBDDA and its compatibility with the master plan of LDA made for Lahore District. 
It will also identify gaps and weaknesses in the projects designs, both on structural / physical and financial side (if any) and suggest possible options for its resolution. 
The committee will also review the site selection/suitability for land acquisition and land acquisition model in the context of launched/planned projects in case of Ruda. It will review financial models of Ruda and LCBDDA and their sustainability.
The committee will also require to evaluate impact of each project (Ruda and LCBDDA) on ancillary infrastructure requirements of Lahore City including traffic, sewerage, energy, water, environment etc. 
It will check the existing illegal constructions in jurisdictional areas and actions taken and any proposed mechanism for its regulations by Ruda.
The committee will be responsible to review court cases/litigation over the land acquisition and environment and its impact on the launched/planned projects by Ruda.
In case of the LCBDDA, the committee will also study the jurisdictional issues and arrangements of land/cost sharing with Civil Aviation Authority, Walton cantonment board and Bab-e-Pakistan Foundation.
“The committee shall submit its report along with a way forward/recommendations on the above TORs to the chief secretary within three weeks,” reads the notification.
It may be mentioned that in August 2020, the then prime minister Imran Khan had laid the foundation stone of the Ravi project. Its urban design consists of three phases; Phase-I is spread over around 45,000 acres, Phase-II over around 34,000 acres and Phase-III 24,000 acres. Twelve cities have been proposed in phases and these are medical city, residential city, government and finance city, innovation city, knowledge city, mix use, sports city, tourism and entertainment, Eco city, commercial, urban farms and downtown. 
As far as the LCBDDA is concerned, Imran Khan had on Feb 26, 2021 laid the foundation stone for the central business district at the Walton Airport site, claiming that the project would help the government generate funds to pay off foreign loans. He had called it an out-of-the-box initiative to create wealth, overcome fiscal as well as current account deficit and sustain the country’s economy, saying that the economic hub would lead to the construction of many high-rises in Gulberg and Ferozepur Road areas. The total land demarcated for the district consists of various chunks of land measuring 278 acres while 122 acres out of the total land are situated along the Ferozepur Road. The remaining pieces of land are in the jurisdiction of Walton Airport and the Bab-e-Pakistan (Walton Road). All the 278 acres fall under the CBDDA’s controlled area.

10,New bench to hear PML-N’s plea in reserved seats case,Bench askes PML-N’s counsel to make necessary amendments in appeal.,"LAHORE: A Lahore High Court division bench on Monday adjourned hearing of an intra court appeal (ICA) of PML-N against a decision of a single bench wherein the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was directed to notify members of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on five reserved seats in the Punjab Assembly.
The appeal was fixed before a new division bench comprising Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh and Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabir. Previously, another bench was hearing the appeal.
A counsel for the PTI sought time for preparation of arguments while the bench asked the PML-N’s counsel to make necessary amendments in the appeal before putting off the hearing till Sept 19.
A single bench had allowed a petition of the PTI and ordered the ECP to issue a notification about the new MPAs on the reserved seats following the disqualification of 25 MPAs over defection during the election of Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz.
The order of the single bench has also been complied with by the ECP.
The appeal of the PML-N argues that the impugned judgement by the single bench is a violation of articles 106(3)(c) and 224(6) of the Constitution. 
It says the reserved seats in the provincial assembly are allotted based on the number of general seats secured by each political party.
It argues that once fresh election/by-poll for the general seats have taken place, only then can the quota of the reserved seats be recalculated and the vacant reserved seats be filled to truly reflect the strength of the political parties through proportional representation.
The appeal asks the court to set aside the decision passed by the single bench.

11,Lawyers on strike for a different cause,Seek ‘special fertiliser package’,"CHINIOT: Local lawyers went on strike on Monday against what they called unjust distribution of fertilisers, failure of the district administration to check hoarding, seeking a “special package” for the provision of fertiliser to their colleagues having farmland.
Responding to strike call by the district bar association (DBA), lawyers did not appear in the courts, causing disappointment to the litigants who had to return without hearings of their cases.  
DBA secretary Mehr Shamsher Haral said the fertilisers were being hoarded by middle men and brokers who had monopoly over the sale of this essential agricultural input.  
He said the dealers and commission agents provided fertilisers to the farmers on credit and later on charged excessive amounts with interest from them when they bring their crop yield to the grain market.
He demanded a ‘special package’ for fertilisers provision to lawyers owning agriculture lands in the district.
He called upon the district administration to pay heed to the issues of farmers and take necessary actions immediately to provide relief to them.
On the other hand, Assistant Commissioner (AC) Bilal Bin Hafeez said there were 14 sale points set up by the district administration for “supervised sale” of fertilisers till last month, but these outlets were closed on the instructions of the Punjab government.
He, however, said the administration was keeping a vigilant eye on the fertiliser dealers to check hoarding, shortage and overcharging. 
He said last month, some 47,000 fertiliser bags were sold by the dealers to the farmers, including lawyers.  
The AC said as the fertiliser was being sold in the open market without control of the district administration, how any “special package” could be announced for the lawyers.  
FINE IMPOSED: The District Education Authority (DEA) has slapped a private school with Rs10,000 fine for starting admissions without having affiliation with the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) concerned, directing its administration to refund one-year fee to a complainant student.  
The DEA chief executive officer imposed Rs10,000 fine on the Basic International School, ordering its administration to refund one-year fee received from a Class IX student, Saima Ghaffar.
Abdul Ghaffar, the father of the student, had lodged a complaint with the DEA CEO, saying the school admitted his daughter in 9th class, without being affiliated with the BISE.
Later, the student had to appear in the exam as a private candidate despite paying the school fee for the whole year.
The CEO deputed Deputy Education Officer (DEO) Muhammad Saeed as inquiry officer who verified the contents of the complaint and recommended action against the school management.
The school principal was also called for personal hearing by the DEO, but he could not justify the student’s admission.
The inquiry report was sent to the Chiniot deputy commissioner, who is also DEA chairman and upon his approval, the CEO slapped fine on school, besides issuing a warning to its management.  
The school management, however, contended that the student’s parents had been told prior to the admission that their daughter would only be given tuition and have to appear in the exam as a private candidate. 
They announced to file an appeal against the CEO’s decision.
