• Defers decision on nine NA seats amid issue of de-notified PTI MNAs
• Imran, Asad, Fawad summoned to appear in person over contempt
ISLAMABAD: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday announ­ced the new date for by-elections on four seats, one in the National Assembly and three in the Punjab Assembly.
In a meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissi­oner Sikandar Sultan Raja, the decision was made to hold polls on NA-157 Mul­tan, PP-139 Sheikhupura, PP-241 Bahawalnagar and PP-209 Khanewal on October 9.
The commission had earlier postponed by-polls on nine NA seats, which were vacated after the de-notification of PTI lawmakers whose resignations were accepted by the speaker.
However, ECP is yet to announce a new date for polls on those seats as it seeks clarity from the Islamabad High Court (IHC) over the status of de-notified MNAs.
The IHC had suspended an ECP’s notification dated July 29 after one of the lawmakers, PTI’s Abdul Shakoor Shad, challenged the speaker’s action and the subsequent de-notification. He was reinstated by IHC on Sept 10.
However, the court on Monday clarified that the decision was only applicable to the petitioner in that particular case and not other lawmakers.
The commission also sought a report from the Sindh government with regards to the second phase of local body elections in the province. A report was also sought from the Balochistan election commissioner over elections in some polling stations of Duki, Loralai, Musakhel and Mastung districts, which were postponed due to floods.
ECP Secretary Omar Hameed Khan has been directed to seek the order’s copy from the IHC after which the commission will decide a new date for the polls on Wednesday.
The decision comes five days after the ECP had postponed the by-polls in ten national and three provincial assembly constituencies that were scheduled for Sept 11, Sept 25 and Oct 2, citing non availability of security forces due to their involvement in relief and rescue duties.
In the absence of these services and owing to the situation created by floods, it was not possible to ensure elections in an orderly and peaceful manner, the commission had said.
Notices to PTI leaders
Also on Monday, the commission issued show-cause notices to PTI Chairman Imran Khan and two other party leaders and summoned them to appear before the commission in person on September 27.
The development came hours after a four-member bench of the ECP took up the contempt case against Mr Khan, Fawad Chaudhry and Asad Umar.
Informed sources told Dawn that the commission found replies submitted by Mr Chaudhry and Mr Umar to be “unsatisfactory” while Mr Khan didn’t submit a reply even after he was given ample time.
In August, the ECP had issued notices to the three leaders for using “intemperate and non-parliamentary language and contemptuous remarks” against the commission and the chief election commissioner.
Advocate Faisal Fareed, who appeared on behalf of the PTI leaders, argued that the notices were in violation of election rules and issued with the signature of the ECP secretary, who was not the commission.
To this argument, a member of the bench remarked that the commission operates through its secretariat.
The PTI’s counsel also objected to the presence of ECP member from Sindh Nisar Durrani, pointing out that a reference against him was pending with the Supreme Judicial Council.
He also questioned the ECP’s powers in contempt cases and pointed out that these powers have already been challenged in the Islamabad High Court.
After hearing the arguments, the ECP reserved the verdict over its jurisdiction to try and punish contemners.
Meanwhile, Mr Chaudhry and Mr Umar in their written replies termed the notices “vague, cursory and without jurisdiction”.
“It is unclear that the notices … are issued under what law and the gist of which also fails to explain, specially the violation of any provision of law for which the notices have been issued?” the identical replies read.

• Khawaja Asif claims PTI chief trying to mend fences with ‘establishment’ for sake of power
ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister Imran Khan proposed on Monday that the appointment of the new army chief be made by an elected government, voted to power after a “free and fair election”, adding that a “provision can be found” in the law to make this arrangement work.
Mr Khan, who brought the issue of the army chief’s appointment into the limelight earlier this month, has consistently opposed the appointment of a new chief by the incumbent government led by the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), a multi-party coalition that ousted Imran Khan through a no-confidence motion in April this year.
General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the incumbent army chief, is set to retire later this year.
Last week, Mr Khan alleged that Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif wanted to appoint an army chief of their liking to evade accountability.
The statement drew intense flak, with both the government and the military calling out Imran Khan for “scandalising” the selection process.
Subsequently, Imran Khan issued a clarification during a rally in Peshawar on Sept 6, saying he had merely sought the appointment of the chief on merit and that his criticism of the army should be perceived as “constructive in nature”.
A month ago, the PTI chief, however, had underscored the need for snap polls to find a way out of the crisis engulfing the country and played down the issue of the appointment of the new chief. “Right now, the more important issue than the army chief’s appointment is stability and only one thing can bring that — elections.”
“We have to choose [...] do we want stability or a new army chief?” he said in response to a question posed by anchorperson Imran Riaz Khan.
However, in his interview with Kamran Khan on Dunya News on Monday, the former premier said the new army chief should not be appointed by Mr Zardari and Mr Sharif, as both were allegedly involved in graft cases.
“I had said that the post of the COAS was extremely important and the appointment should be made on merit. I will repeat this again and again. But I will also mention that Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif are not qualified to make the appointment on merit...every decision these two take is to save their stolen wealth,” Mr Khan alleged.
He, however, added that if the current ruling parties managed to come back to power after free and fair elections, he would have no issue with them appointing a new chief. He added PML-N only had 85 seats in the National Assembly whereas the PTI had over 150 seats.
At this, the anchorperson asked the former premier whether he was proposing an extension in the term of the incumbent army chief, since elections could take up to three months, while the appointment needed to be made in November.
Mr Khan responded that he had not thought about the issue in too much detail. “Lawyers have told me that a provision can be found that a new government can make the appointment after coming to power,” the PTI chief said, adding that it was not a major issue.
When asked to elaborate further, Imran Khan said he did not have any expertise in the matter, but the immediate priority should be rescuing the country from the crisis it currently found itself in. He hinted that he was ready to talk to his opponents on every issue, if they were ready to agree to his demand for fresh elections.
‘Doors of negotiation’
Earlier in the day, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif alleged that the PTI chief was trying to open the “doors of negotiation” with the establishment in his “desperation for power”.
“On one side, he is attacking them [the establishment] and on other hand, he wants to open the doors of negotiations or dialogue as well,” Dawn.com quoted the minister as having told SAMAA TV.
The defence minister said that the recent statements made by Mr Khan showed that he wanted to talk to the establishment at “gunpoint” and “by force”. “He just wants to take his government back, whether it is in the right or wrong way […] this is [his] desperation for power,” Mr Asif alleged.
He went on to say that Imran was using pressure tactics, recalling that before the PTI chief was ousted, he was an “admirer” of the establishment. “At that time, the establishment was fine […] but today, you are abusing and attacking them.”

2,Flood dashboard launched as govt warns of more rains,Portal launched to ensure transparency in allocation relief funds; Sherry warns that Sindh is still in perilous situation.,"ISLAMABAD: The gover­nment on Monday laun­ched its ‘Digital Flood Dashboard’ to ensure transparency in the allocation of funds and to keep the nation informed about the rescue and relief activities in the flood-hit areas.
Meanwhile, Federal Mini­s­ter for Climate Change Sen­a­tor Sherry Rehman warned that Sindh is still in a perilous situation as Indus River is still in high flood at Kotri Barrage with inflows of more than 600,000 cusecs.
The dashboard was launched by Planning Minister and National Flood Response and Coordination Centre (NFRCC) chief Ahsan Iqbal. Speaking on the occasion, the minister said the portal had been launched on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to ensure transparency and provide information to the general public as well as donors about the relief activities and distribution of funds.
Stating that the floods have affected nearly 33 million people, the minister said the scale of the disaster was so big that even if it had happened in any developed country, it would have been larger than their “administrative capabilities”.
Mr Iqbal said the damage was being assessed on a daily basis and final estimates would be available after water receded from the affected.
Minister warns of more rains
Talking about the flood situation in Sindh, Ms Rehman said the high flood situation in the Indus River was posing a serious threat to the surrounding regions.
She also warned of more rainfall in the southern parts of Sindh, which she said could prove detrimental to relief and rescue operations.
Discussing the looming health crisis, she said Karachi was seeing an outbreak of dengue and the cases were already 50 per cent higher than last year.

She said efforts aimed at providing medicines and medics to 81 calamity-hit districts were being expedited.
Calling food insecurity ‘another impending crisis’, the minister said that around 70pc of the onion crop along with rice and maize had been completely destroyed in the country.
She said urgent relief in the form of food, tents and medicines was being provided by national and provincial disaster management authorities, but more resources were required to meet the needs on ground.
She said the death toll in the country has reached 1,422 while Sindh has recorded the highest number of deaths with 594 casualties.
She thanked the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres for his visit and ‘making an unequivocal plea for humanitarian assistance to Pakistan’.
Telecom sites restored
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) has said that the majority of mobile phone towers that were damaged by floods had been restored and the services resumed.
In a press release, the PTA said that due to the joint efforts of the authority and telecom operators to restore connectivity, the number of non-functional sites had been reduced to 190 which was a mere 0.3pc of the total sites across the country.
The press release added that currently, 153 cell sites in Sindh and 37 in Balochistan are affected and inaccessible due to floodwaters.
The PTA is continuously monitoring the situation and will continue to update the public about the restoration of services, the press release said.

3,Ex-GB judge Rana Shamim files ‘apology’; maintains allegations against ex-CJP Saqib Nisar,Says none of the sitting IHC jud­ges were involved in engineering judicial proceedings in cases against Sharif family.,"ISLAMABAD: Former Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) chief judge Rana Mohammad Sha­­mim submitted an unco­nditional apology to the Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Monday, saying none of the sitting jud­ges of the IHC were involved in engineering judicial proceedings in cases against the Sharif family.
Mr Shamim is facing a contempt case over his affidavit that alleged manipulation of court proceedings by ex-CJP Saqib Nisar in a case pertaining to Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz.
The affidavit had claimed that in 2018, then-CJP Nisar had manipulated the proceedings to delay the release of Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz through a “senior puisne” judge of the high court. Subsequently, contempt proceedings were initiated by the IHC.
In his response, Mr Shamim stated that not a single sitting judge of the IHC was involved in the controversy and sought pardon from all judges.
“I had heard the words senior puisne judge time and again from the CJP… [I] became victim of a misunderstanding and mistakenly wrote down the name of Mr Justice Aamer Farooq instead of senior puisne judge in the affidavit,” the former GB judge said in his response.
He, however, stood by the allegation against ex-CJP Nisar.
“The contents of the affidavit emanates from the sitting in which myself, my late wife, the former CJP Saqib Nisar along with his wife were present at my official residence when I was Chief Judge of Gilgit Baltistan Supreme Appellate Court … the former CJP on the first day of their stay while taking tea on the lawn of my residence, was trying to get connected with someone time and again, but when the said person could not be connected, then he directed his registrar to go and see him at his residence and tell him that Mian Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz Sharif should not come out on bail.”
“Since he could not be connected, therefore he directed the registrar to call him on WhatsApp as soon as possible. After some time, the then-CJP was connected to the person, he talked for [a] few minutes; thereafter he felt relaxed and said that he has spoken to the senior puisne judge and demanded another cup of tea.”
Mr Shamim said that his affidavit was executed in the “backdrop of [a] mentally stressful time” which “potentially resulted in blurring of memory and some grave misunderstanding (sic) which also translated into the writing of the affidavit”, which was later published by a newspaper.
Referring to his act of naming an IHC judge, he maintained: “Due to these circumstances, I inadvertently made this grave mistake, which I deeply regret now and unconditionally apologise for.”
During the course of the hearing, Abdul Latif Afridi, counsel for Mr Shamim, requested the court to consider the apology ‘genuine’. Justice Minallah remarked that the high court was “extremely magnanimous and ready to accept the apology, but it depends on the conduct of the alleged contemnor”.
The court, however, asked Mr Shamim to reconsider his unconditional apology and submit an affidavit on September 19, when the court would resume hearing in this matter.

4,CJP bemoans govt ‘reaction’ that derailed JCP sitting,Links deadlock at judicial body meeting with adverse judgement in Punjab CM election case.,"• Links deadlock at judicial body meeting with adverse judgement in Punjab CM election case
• Wonders whether such a reaction reflects ‘any respect for the rule of law’ on government’s part
• Expresses surprise over bar’s ‘partisan request’ echoing a political party’s stance
ISLAMABAD: In an unusually candid address, Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial aired his grievance with the ruling coalition on Monday, questioning whether an adverse decision from the court justified what he called the government’s ‘unprecedented’ step to refuse support for judges proposed by him before the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the new judicial year 2022-23, the CJP mentioned the July 26 apex court decision, which declared Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as the chief minister of Punjab in the July 22 run-off poll, observing that the displeasure of the federal government on this decision became evident two days later at the JCP meeting on July 28.
Convened to consider five judges for elevation, the CJP said that “for the first time since JCP was constituted thr­o­ugh the... 18th Amendment, the representatives of the federal government in the commission either deferred or chose not to support the candidates proposed by its chairman (CJP). As a result, the meeting had to be adjourned.”
Does this reflect any respect for the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, he asked, adding: “I simply leave the matter there.”
CJP Bandial also cautioned that the apex court was committed to defending the Constitution, its commands and directions to the state and to the people, the enforcement of fundamental rights and for the lawful functioning of all the institutions.
“The court will not hesitate to act if the Constitution or the constitutional institutions are undermined, violated or attacked,” he warned, emphasising that it was aware that the country was presently facing serious economic and political challenges.
Monday’s ceremony was held to take stock of the judiciary’s performance in the past year and formulate future policies for the advancement of justice and protection of fundamental rights.
Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman read out the speech of Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf whereas Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Hafeezur Rehman Chaudhry and Supreme Court Bar Association President Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon also spoke on the occasion.
Referring to the Parvez Elahi case, CJP Bandial regretted how the decision prompted a sharp reaction from political quarters that were disappointed by it. However, as the guardians of the Constitution, the apex court and its judges exercised restraint and remained detached from such rhetoric.
“Nevertheless, it did surprise the court that during the hearing of the case the current and several past office-bearers of the Bar approached the bench with a request to constitute a full court on the urging of the leader of the political party that is also the principal member of the coalition in the federal government,” he recalled, adding it was done without any legal grounds.
“The request was unexpected because the Bar was pleading a partisan political cause without even being a party to the case,” he said, in a thinly veiled reference to the Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan, which had joined the coalition partners in calling for the constitution of a full bench of the apex court to consider the matter of the Punjab CM’s run-off election.
Talking about the recent floods that had engulfed nearly a third of the country and displaced nearly 33 million people, the CJP said that apart from private contributions, SC judges had also voluntarily contributed an additional amount equivalent to three day’s salary, while the court staff had donated two day’s worth of their salaries to the relief effort.
However, despite generous donations from all quarters, the government faced a formidable task and unenviable obligation to steer the country towards rehabilitation and recovery. He also urged all political parties, their leaders, all decision makers and privileged members of society to set aside their differences and act in unity for public interest.
The CJP also recalled how from Feb 2 to Sept 9 the court had decided 14,943 cases, minimizing the backlog from 54,134.
Earlier, AAG Rehman on behalf of the AGP highlighted the dire need for an institutional dialogue to ensure that the federation pushed ahead with harmony between the constituent units.
The AGP’s statement also sought development of a consensus on articles 175A and 177 of the Constitution, adding the Supreme Court must be working at full strength to be able to shoulder its responsibilities for which there should be some structured criteria on the appointment of judges.
