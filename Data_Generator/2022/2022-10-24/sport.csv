Babar Azam’s side failed to chase 171 to beat Sri Lanka,their 23-run defeat bucking the trend of teams winning while batting second in Dubai. 
Mohammad Rizwan made 55 in 49 balls for Pakistan and finished as the tournament’s leading scorer with 281 runs in six innings. 
But Saqlain was not worried about Rizwan’s sluggish strike rate of 117.57 runs per hundred balls in the high-octane format. 
By comparison, Virat Kohli scored 276 runs for India at a more rapid 147.59 across his five innings. 
“Everyone has their own style of playing cricket,” Saqlain said. “We made the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup (last year) and now the final of the Asia Cup, so evidence suggests we are doing something right. 
“We did so with our style of play, and the things that are left to be done will be worked upon, rather than following the style of the rest of the cricket-playing nations.” 
Babar, a prolific scorer for the team before the tournament, managed just 68 runs in six matches with a highest of 30, but Saqlain dismissed concerns about the opener’s loss of form. 
“If someone looks at his batting, you’d just say he’s unlucky, especially the way he’s getting out,” Saqlain said. 
“It’s just a patch. If you look at the rankings, he’s (among the) top in T20 International and in ODIs. It’s just been bad luck. The way he’s training and playing it’s amazing. 
“The way he plays and his work ethic needs no further discussion. He is a world-class player and God save him from the evil eye.” 
The 27-year-old Babar, who has scored 2,754 runs in 80 Twenty20 internationals at an average of over 42, recently lost his number one T20 world ranking to fellow opener Rizwan. 
Saqlain also dismissed suggestions of a left-right opening combination of Fakhar Zaman with either Babar or Rizwan. 
“If you keep shuffling, it sends a message that you don’t trust them,” he said. “You need to give them time. It’s not good to shuffle a lot. It sends a wrong message.” 
Saqlain praised champions Sri Lanka, who previously beat Pakistan, India and Afghanistan in the Super Four stage, for their complete showing in the final. 
“Sri Lanka batted second and then batted first against us and became champions. Well deserved,” said Saqlain. “We just played first nine overs of really good cricket and after that they played almost 31 overs and dominated us in all aspects — in batting, bowling and fielding.”

1,"Asia Cup triumph will help T20 World Cup preparation, says Shanaka",DUBAI: Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka said winning the Asia Cup will help the team’s preparation for next...,"DUBAI: Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka said winning the Asia Cup will help the team’s preparation for next month’s Twenty20 World Cup and dedicated the win to the crisis-hit nation. 
Sri Lanka won the Asia Cup for the sixth time on Sunday after Bhanuka Rajapaksa’s batting masterclass and Wanindu Hasaranga’s all-round brilliance secured their 23-run victory against Pakistan in the final. 
Sri Lanka, who won the T20 World Cup in 2014, are due to begin their World Cup campaign with a qualifying match against Namibia on Oct. 16. 
“We played last year’s qualifiers as well ... it’s the set-up that has come through from three or four years back,” Shanaka told reporters. “The last two years were really good for us ... and winning Asia Cup will really help for the ... World Cup. 
“The World Cup qualifiers will help as well because we will play in those conditions before the main tournament happens so it’ll be really good for us. 
“The players have been playing good cricket for two, three years but the winning factor was not there. This will be a real good turnaround in our cricket. This lot [of players] will continue for another five, six years, so that will be a very good sign for us.” 
The island nation has suffered months of economic crisis and political unrest with blackouts, fuel shortages and protests becoming part of their lives. 
The Sri Lankan fans present at the Dubai International Stadium celebrated the win with drums and songs as the team took a victory lap of the ground with the trophy. 
“They were waiting for it for so long, especially the final,” Shanaka said. “We should dedicate this win to the whole nation.” 
Coach Chris Silverwood, appointed in April to lead Sri Lanka having overseen England’s Ashes humiliation in Australia, has been credited for the team’s new-found confidence. 
The Englishman was seen having a chat with Rajapaksa, who scored an unbeaten 71, and Hasaranga, who made 36 and then took 3-27 with his leg-spin, during a key 58-run stand between the two batsmen that lifted Sri Lanka from a precarious 58-5 to 170-6. 
“He has always been a good motivator for us and always wants us to play aggressive cricket,” said Rajapaksa. We have been given the freedom to play as we wish. And that really helps us as a team and as a young unit to come and win games like this. 
“We all just wanted to show the whole world, a couple of decades back, that we had some sort of aggression in our side. And we wanted to create those moments again. I think, as a unit, we are doing that fantastically well at the moment,” he said. 
“We want to look forward to the World Cup as well and to keep up this momentum. As a nation, I think it’s a great win ... with all the crisis happening back home, these are tough times for Sri Lankans. We are glad and hope that we brought some smiles to their faces.”

2,The future is now: Alcaraz wins US Open and becomes youngest world number one,"Claims his first Grand Slam title with a 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 win over Norway’s Casper Ruud.","NEW YORK: Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz completed his rapid rise to the top of the tennis world on Sunday, claiming his first Grand Slam title and taking the number one ranking with a 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3 win over Norway’s Casper Ruud in the US Open final. 
Alcaraz, 19, fell to his back and cupped his hands to his face before jumping up to embrace Ruud at the net. He then climbed past photographers and into the stands to celebrate in his box with his team. 
“This is something I dreamed of since I was a kid, to be number one in the world, to be the champion at a Grand Slam,” Alcaraz said in an on-court interview. 
“All the hard work that I did with my team, with my family. I’m just 19-years-old so all of the tough decisions are with my parents and my team as well. This is something that is really, really special for me.” 
Alcaraz, the first teenager to claim the top ranking, is the youngest Grand Slam men’s champion since his idol Rafael Nadal at the 2005 French Open. On a day of landmarks, he is also the youngest champion in New York since Pete Sampras in 1990. 
The electrifying Alcaraz, who thrilled fans over the two-week tournament in New York with his explosive speed, booming forehand and acrobatic shotmaking, replaced Russian Daniil Medvedev at the top of the rankings. He is the youngest world number one since the ATP rankings began in 1973, breaking the mark set by Lleyton Hewitt, who was 20 when he became number one in 2001. 
Alcaraz had a difficult path to the title. He battled from a break down in the fifth set to beat Marin Cilic in the fourth round, played the latest finishing match in tournament history to defeat Italy’s Jannik Sinner in the quarters, and faced down American Frances Tiafoe in the semis. 
“I always say that there is no time to be tired in the final round of a Grand Slam or any tournament,” said Alcaraz, who spent 23 hours and 40 minutes on court over his seven matches. “You have to give everything you have inside.” 
Nadal, the winner of men’s record 22 Grand Slam titles, took to Twitter to offer his congratulations to his countryman and predicted more success was on the way. “Well, I have one. He has 22,” a beaming Alcaraz told reporters. “I’m in the row.” 
Ruud was trying to become the first Norwegian to capture the top spot but was unable to match Alcaraz’s firepower under the closed roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium. French Open finalist Ruud will rise to second in the world from number seven. Sunday’s final was the first featuring two men competing for both their first Grand Slam title and the world number one ranking. 
“We knew what we were playing for, we knew what was at stake,” said Ruud. “Number two is not too bad either. I will continue to chase for my first Grand Slam and the number one world ranking. At the moment Carlos is the best player in the world. It’s incredibly impressive what he has achieved already as a teenager. He’s one of these few rare talents that comes up every now and then in sports.” 
Despite being at the vanguard of tennis’s modern era, Alcaraz’s performance on Sunday also contained elements of a bygone age — he won 15 points off 21 serve-and-volley attempts. 
The US Open is Alcaraz’s fifth trophy of 2022 following Masters triumphs in Miami and Madrid as well as Rio and Barcelona. It was in Madrid that he announced himself as a serious threat to the sport’s heavyweights when he became the first man to defeat Nadal and Novak Djokovic at the same claycourt event. 
“Carlos was born to play these tournaments,” said his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero, a former number one and French Open champion. 
This year’s US Open broke the event’s attendance record and marked the first time that every session at the 23,859-capacity Arthur Ashe Stadium sold out, tournament organisers said. 
The two-week main draw attendance was 776,120, surpassing the previous record of 737,872 set in 2019. 
While for many years the Flushing Meadows spotlight has shone on the ‘Big Three’ of Nadal, Djokovic and Roger Federer, it was the future of the men’s game — Alcaraz, Ruud, Sinner and Tiafoe — thrilling the crowds this time around. 
Alcaraz said he is hungry fore more after getting his first taste of Grand Slam glory. “I want to be in the top for many, many weeks. I hope many years,” he said. “I’m going to work hard again after this amazing two weeks. I’m going to fight to have more of this.”

3,England seal memorable season with South Africa series victory,"Thrash South Africa by nine wickets in third and deciding Test at Oval, securing 2-1 series win.","LONDON: England thrashed South Africa by nine wickets in the third and deciding Test at the Oval on Monday, completing a 2-1 series win in just over two days of action.
The home side, who resumed on 97-0, needed just 5.3 more overs to reach a victory target of 130. Zak Crawley was 69 not out and Ollie Pope unbeaten on 11.
England have now won six of their seven Tests under their new leadership pairing of captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum, having managed just one victory in their previous 17 matches when former skipper Joe Root was in charge.
“I’m delighted,” said Stokes.  “It’s been a great series for us as a team.
“It has been one of those series where we haven’t had many individual standout performances, but different people have put their hand up for us throughout and that’s what you want in team sport.
“You want to be able to turn to people at key times and break the game open with either bat or ball and that’s what we’ve had throughout.” 
Defeat means South Africa have suffered their first Test series loss since Dean Elgar took over as captain last year.
England resumed just 33 runs shy of their target after the umpires had halted play on Sunday because of bad light to the disappointment of a capacity crowd.
Alex Lees was 32 not out and Zak Crawley 57 not out — his first fifty in 17 Test innings — when play started Monday under sunny skies but in front of a handful of spectators, who had been let in for free.
Lees, having added just two to his overnight score, was dropped off the third ball of the day when he edged Kagiso Rabada, only for diving wicketkeeper Kyle Verre­ynne to floor the chance.
The batsman’s luck ran out, however, when he was lbw on review to Rabada for 39, with South Africa at least spared the embarrassment of a 10-wicket defeat.
Crawley hit the winning runs when he punched left-arm quick Marco Jansen through the covers for four — the 12th boundary of his innings.
It meant for the third time this series, a match was won inside three days’ playing time.
Thursday’s play was washed out completely before Friday’s scheduled second day was abandoned as a mark of respect following the death of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II.
Fast bowlers on both sides dominated a series in which runs were hard to come by, with South Africa, who boast a world-class pace attack but a fragile top order, managing just one individual fifty — opener Sarel Erwee’s 73 in their innings-and-12-run win in the first Test at Lord’s.
England bounced back to win the second Test at Old Trafford by an innings and 85 runs.
Seamer Ollie Robinson was named player-of-the-match at the Oval for his career-best 5-49 in South Africa’s first innings.
On Sunday South Africa’s inexperienced batting lineup had no answer to England’s swinging seam attack, slumping from a strong start to 169 all out to hand the initiative to the hosts. 
“First innings runs are so big in the UK and we’ve failed in that department,” South Africa captain Dean Elgar said. “It was a tough decision (to select the top six) and it didn’t work this game, but it was an eye-opening experience for those guys. “I’ve got to give our bowlers credit; they ran in and did all that was asked of them, but it all boils down to our batting.”
Scoreboard
SOUTH AFRICA (1st Innings) 118 (O Robinson 5-49, S Broad 4-41)

4,Mark Boucher to step down as South Africa coach after World Cup,"Will leave his post to pursue  “other opportunities in line with his future career and personal objectives”, say officials.","LONDON: South Africa coach Mark Boucher will leave his post after the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia later this year to pursue  “other opportunities in line with his future career and personal objectives”, officials said on Monday.
The announcement came hours after South Africa lost their three-match Test series in England.
Former wicket-keeper Boucher, who played 147 Tests for South Africa, has been in the role since December 2019 and had been contracted until the end of the 2023 50-over World Cup in October next year.
“We would like to thank Mark for the time and effort he has invested in South African cricket as the head coach over the past three years,” Cricket South Africa CEO Pholetsi Moseki said in a media statement.
“He has helped navigate us through some rough waters following the departures of so many senior players through retirement and has helped lay some strong foundations for the next generation of Proteas.
“We are extremely grateful to him for the work he has done and would like to wish him well with the next chapter of his career.”
Boucher has generally won praise for improving South Africa’s Test and white ball cricket, though the recent five-day series in England was woeful for the batsmen with no quick fix to that problem in sight.
The highlight of his tenure to date was a home test series win over India in January, which has helped South Africa reach second place in the ICC Test World Championship table.
Boucher will be at the helm for the limited overs side on their India tour before the Twenty20 World Cup, after which the red ball side will travel to Australia for three Tests starting in December by which time a new coach will be in place.

Seven Premier League games will go ahead this weekend, with Brighton & Hove Albion’s match against Crystal Palace having previously been postponed due to a planned rail strike. 
Despite the strike since being cancelled, the match remains off. 
Arsenal’s trip to Brentford on Sunday has also been moved forward two hours to a midday kick-off. 
“Following extensive consultation with clubs, police, local Safety Advisory Groups and other relevant authorities, there was no other option but to postpone the three fixtures,” the Premier League said in a statement. 
“The Premier League would like to thank the UK Football Policing Unit and other police forces across the country, as well as our broadcast partners, for their support during this process, and will continue to liaise with them ahead of the weekend. 
“For the matches being played during the period of national mourning, tributes will be paid to The Queen at Premier League stadiums.” 
United said their match was postponed because the Greater Manchester Police are “supporting forces across the United Kingdom at locations and events of high significance” after the queen’s death. 
New dates for the rearranged fixtures will be announced in due course, the league added. 
Earlier, England’s Football Association (FA) and the English Football League (EFL) said matches will resume as scheduled from Tuesday after the last round of fixtures were postponed following the queen’s death last week. 
“After a period of pause and reflection for our national game, we can confirm that fixtures will resume as scheduled,” the FA said on Monday. 
Arsenal’s Europa League clash with PSV Eindhoven on Thursday has also been called off due to the huge police operation required in London this week, with the Queen to lie in state between Wednesday and her funeral on September 19.

Defending Champions Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — who had previously won five matches — all in Rawalpindi, are yet to win in Multan.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained seven-run short of the target as captain Khalid Usman returned undefeated on 26-ball 28, smashing two fours and one six. Requiring 15 runs from the final over, Khalid struck Usman Khan Shinwari for a first-ball six, but the left-arm pacer came back strong and gave away only two runs of the remaining five balls.
After a flying start of 31 from 3.2 overs from the openers, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were 65 for four in 8.2 overs courtesy fine bowling display from Mehran Mumtaz. The 19-year old Mehran — who had previously represented Pakistan in the ICC U19 World Cup in 2022 — accounted for Mohammad Haris (41), Israrullah (three) and Mohammad Sarwar Afridi (five) and returned with figures of three for 20 from four overs. Right-arm fast Zaman Khan finished with two for 31. 
Earlier, after opting to bat, Northern wobbled at the top of the innings when they slumped to 31 for three inside the powerplay. Zeeshan Malik — batting at number four was joined by right-handed Mubasir Khan and the pair knitted 55-run partnership for the fourth wicket. Zeeshan top-scored with a 40-ball 52, studded with seven fours and a maximum. Mubasir scored 22 from 17 balls, smashing two fours and one six.

Juventus, who recorded their fourth draw in six Serie A games this season, thought they had snatched all three points when substitute Arkadiusz Milik headed home in the 94th minute but the goal was disallowed following a VAR review for offside.
Milik was sent off for a second yellow card after taking his shirt off in a premature celebration, along with team-mate Juan Cuadrado and Salernitana’s Federico Fazio who were involved in a confrontation as tempers flared between the teams in a prolonged melee.
The draw left Juventus eighth in the table on 10 points, level, with Salerni­tana three points behind in 10th.
The visitors took the lead in the 18th minute when Pasquale Mazzocchi’s cross from the edge of the six-yard box found midfielder Antonio Candreva who converted with his body from close range.
Striker Krzysztof Piatek made it 2-0 to Salernitana with a coolly-taken spot-kick just before halftime, sending keeper Mattia Perin the wrong way after the visitors were awarded a penalty when Gleison Bremer blocked Piatek’s strike with his hand.
Juventus sprung to life when Bremer scored in the 51st minute with a fantastic header and the home side then dominated possession and pressed high up the field and were awarded a penalty for a foul by Tonny Vilhena on defender Alex Sandro.
Bonucci failed to beat goalkeeper Luigi Sepe with his effort from the spot but fired home on the rebound.
Juve were not done there, however, and thought they had won it when Milik rose at the near post from a corner to glance his effort in before celebrating wildly.
Referee Matteo Marcenaro, however, was sent across to the VAR screen following a lengthy stoppage and the goal was ruled out as Bonucci was shown to be offside in front of the keeper when Milik made contact with the ball.
Atalanta had been out on their own as leaders of Italy’s top flight for  the first time in over 60 years heading into the weekend’s fixtures but Emanuele Valeri’s 78th-minute leveller earned Cremonese a point in Bergamo to leave Gian Piero Gasperini’s side second. 
Atalanta, who opened the scoring through Merih Demiral four minutes  before Valeri’s strike, are level on 14 points with leaders Napoli and  reigning champions AC Milan, both winners on Saturday.  Promoted Cremonese stay in the bottom three on two points. 
Lazio are three points behind the leading trio after a 2-0 home win  over Verona which came thanks to Ciro Immobile and Luis Alberto.  
Bologna won their first match without Sinisa Mihajlovic as coach  with Marko Arnautovic netting his sixth of the season in a 2-1 win over  Fiorentina.

9,"Barca’s Lewandowski, City’s Haaland set for CL reunions with former teams",LONDON: Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski faces a rapid return to his former club Bayern Munich in a key ...,"LONDON: Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski faces a rapid return to his former club Bayern Munich in a key Champions League tie on Tuesday night.
Lewandowski scored a hat-trick in his Champions League debut for Barca at home to Viktoria Plzen last week, but Bayern will be much tougher opponents as they look to continue their recent positive results against Barca.
The 8-2 defeat that Bayern inflicted on Barca in August 2020 was traumatic for the Catalan club, as were two 3-0 losses in the group stage last season, which went away to ensuring that Barca failed to qualify for the knockout stage of the competition.
After a summer of big spending, it’s vital for Barca to make it out of the group this time, and a win in Munich would be a huge step towards assuring that.
Barca coach Xavi Herna­nd­ez rested key players, such as Lewandowski, Ousmane Dembele and Pedri in their weekend win away to Cadiz, and they are expected to start in the Allianz Arena on Tuesday.
Former Bayern legend Karl-Heinz Rummenigge commented in the Spanish newspaper Diario AS that he hopes Bayern fans give Lewandowski a warm welcome on his return.
“We shouldn’t forget that he played here for eight years, during which time he won everything you can win and scored between 30-50 goals every season. He also joined us for nothing and he went leaving 45 million euros, so he made a big contribution to Bayern,” commented Rummenigge.
Atletico Madrid are also in action in Germany on Tuesday with a visit to play Bayer Leverkusen. After last week’s dramatic win at home to FC Porto, a second win would put Atletico in the driving seat in their group, and Diego Simeone rested Joao Felix, Koke and Marcos Llorente for Tuesday’s game.
Leverkusen kicked off their European campaign with a surprise defeat at Club Brugge, which leaves them with a lot of work to do if they want to battle with Atletico and Porto for a place in the last 16.
Norwegian marksman Erling Haaland swapped Dortmund for City in the transfer window and will no doubt be looking forward to finding the back of the net against them.
Also on Tuesday, Liverpool will hope to answer their crushing 4-1 opening loss at Napoli with a good result against Ajax while Tottenham Hotspur visit Sporting Lisbon.
Wednesday’s top match sees another narrative of a leading striker coming up against his former team when Manchester City welcome Borussia Dortmund to the Etihad Stadium.
Haaland scored twice in City’s opening 4-0 win at Sevilla last week and has 25 goals in 20 Champions League appearances overall.
Wednesday also features defending champions Real Madrid welcoming RB Leipzig to the Spanish capital, an intriguing clash between Juventus and Benfica in Turin, Paris St Germain visiting Maccabi Haifa and Chelsea hosting RB Salzburg at Stamford Bridge in London.

A solo effort from Federico Valverde on the stroke of halftime levelled the scores after Vedat Muqiri had stunned the home crowd by nodding the visitors ahead. Vinicius put the hosts in front before Rodrygo and Antonio Rudiger completed the rout.
Real returned to the top of the table, two points ahead of second-placed Barcelona.
A much-chan­ged Real initially struggled to gain a foothold and sorely missed injured talisman Karim Benzema in attack throughout a below-par first half.
Muqiri, who was denied by Thibaut Courtois inside the opening 40 seconds, headed in unmarked at the back post after 35 minutes and it appeared the champions would go in trailing at the break for the first time this campaign.
That changed, however, in added time at the end of the half when Valverde ran the length of the pitch before firing home a left-footed shot from the edge of the box.
After the break the hosts monopolised the ball, but were fortunate when Antonio Sanchez fired wide from six yards out with the goal gaping on a rare foray forward from the Balearic Islanders.
Rodrygo’s mazy run fed Vinicius 18 minutes from time and the Brazilian forward netted for a fifth consecutive game to put Real in front, before Rodrygo, who capped off a delightful run with a perfect finish, and a first goal in Madrid colours for Rudiger added late gloss to the scoreline.
Meanwhile, Rodri scored the only goal as Real Betis defeated Villarreal 1-0 to climb to third, with Unai Emery’s side conceding for the first time this season. 
Athletic Bilbao are up to fifth following a 4-1 victory at  second-bottom Elche, while Getafe earned their first win after beating Real Sociedad 2-1.

Philippe Clement’s side only won one of their first five league matches this term but have bounced back since a 4-2 home loss to Troyes, beating Nice last weekend and Red Star Belgrade in the Europa League in midweek. Lyon suffered a second defeat of the week after losing their unbeaten record against Lorient on Wednesday.
Both teams squandered several chances in the first half, before Monaco defender Benoit Badiashile put the hosts ahead in the 55th minute by heading home Caio Henrique’s corner. The Brazilian provided the second goal from another set-piece eight minutes later, as Guillermo Maripan glanced home his inswinging free-kick.
Lyon got themselves back into the game late on with Karl Toko Ekambi’s fourth goal of the campaign, but Monaco held on to move up to seventh in the table.
Earlier, Lorient continued their fine season by climbing into fourth place with a 3-2 home win over Nantes.

12,New Zealand leave Australia frustrated again,MELBOURNE: A despondent New Zealand face a period of introspection on home soil after a stinging white-ball series...,"MELBOURNE: A despondent New Zealand face a period of introspection on home soil after a stinging white-ball series loss against Australia rocked the Black Caps’ confidence ahead of the T20 World Cup.
Australia’s 25-run victory in the third ODI in Cairns on Sunday completed a 3-0 series sweep after New Zealand squandered winning positions in the first two matches.
New Zealand’s last win over Australia in any format was back in 2011, when they grabbed a seven-run win in a Hobart Test.
With Australia set to host the T20 World Cup in October, Kane Williamson’s team have yet to find a way to beat the defending champions in their own backyard.
It was “a pretty frustrated dressing room last night”, New Zealand head coach Gary Stead told reporters on Monday. 
“The guys are disappointed and we’re frustrated to think of having opportunities in all three matches and not getting over the line,” he added.
The Black Caps, beaten by Australia in last year’s T20 World Cup final in the United Arab Emirates, notched their first T20 and one-day series wins away to the West Indies last month after bullying Scotland, Ireland and Netherlands on white-ball tours.
However, they have plenty of concerns as they struggle to regenerate following the loss of key personnel to retirement and the lure of lucrative T20 leagues.
No New Zealand batsman managed a half-century through the Chappell-Hadlee series and selectors will fret over how to replace pace spearhead Trent Boult over the long-term following his decision to relinquish his central contract.
Boult, who was the top wicket-taker against Australia with 10 victims in the ODI series, will continue to play for his country but have a “significantly reduced role”, New Zealand Cricket said last month.
He will be available for selection for T20 World Cup warm-ups against Pakistan and Bangladesh starting Oct. 8 in Christchurch. 
“He’s been a fine bowler and still is a fine bowler for New Zealand and that showed through this series against Australia as well,” said Stead. 
“If Trent is there then I think we look like a stronger team but we have to make some decisions around what that looks like for us going forward as well, because we do have to keep developing our depth.”

13,Own goal sends Union Berlin top,COLOGNE: Union Berlin moved to the top of the Bundesliga standings for the first time in the club’s history after...,"COLOGNE: Union Berlin moved to the top of the Bundesliga standings for the first time in the club’s history after they came away from Cologne with a 1-0 win on Sunday thanks to an own goal early in the game.
In a whirlwind opening to the match, Union were fortunate to take the lead in the third minute when Cologne defender Timo Huebers’s attempted block on a low cross was deflected past his goalkeeper at the near post.
Cologne were unlucky to concede a penalty five minutes later when a header came off the back of Luca Kilian’s elbow but goalkeeper Marvin Schwaebe saved Jordan Siebatcheu’s tame spot kick. Union had their opportunities to double the lead andKilian’s afternoon got worse when he was sent off for a second yellow card. 
Later, Freiburg missed their chance to move top and are one point behind Union in second after a goalless draw with Borussia Moenc­hengladbach.

14,Australia in no hurry to appoint new ODI skipper,MELBOURNE: Australia will likely wait until after the T20 World Cup to unveil Aaron Finch’s replacement as one-day...,"MELBOURNE: Australia will likely wait until after the T20 World Cup to unveil Aaron Finch’s replacement as one-day captain, coach Andrew McDonald said.
Finch bowed out of ODIs after leading Australia to a 3-0 series sweep of New Zealand in Cairns on Sunday but the opener remains in charge of the T20 side.
McDonald said staff were more focused on Australia’s T20 World Cup defence on home soil than deciding on Finch’s successor. 
“It’s probably the end of the (T20) World Cup really isn’t it?” he told reporters. 
“We have got a little bit of time to consider what those options look like. 
“We’ve got the (T20) World Cup in front of us so that’s more pressing at this stage than filling the captaincy void.”  
Batsman Steve Smith and current Test skipper Pat Cummins are seen as strong candidates to replace Finch.
Smith led the Test and one-day sides before he was suspended from international cricket for a year and banned from leadership roles for two years after the Newlands ball-tampering scandal in 2018.
Paceman Cummins took over the Test side after Tim Paine stepped down from the role in the lead-up to the Ashes. He has helped steer Australia to number one in the ICC’s Test world rankings.
Australia’s next ODI matches are against England at home from Nov. 17, a few days after the T20 World Cup final on Nov. 13.
