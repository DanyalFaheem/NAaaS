0,Biden signs order to help abortion seekers,"US president accuses top court of ""exercising raw political power"" in ruling that overturned right to abortion.","WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden said on Friday the Supreme Court’s decision overturning the right to abortion was an exercise in “raw political power” and signed an executive order to help protect access to services to terminate pregnancies.
Biden, a Democrat, has been under pressure from his own party to take action after the landmark decision last month to overturn Roe v Wade, which upended roughly 50 years of protections for women’s reproductive rights.
The president’s powers are constrained because US states can make laws restricting abortion and access to medication, and the executive order is expected to have a limited impact.
“What we’re witnessing wasn’t a constitutional judgement, it was an exercise in raw political power,” Biden told reporters at the White House after quoting heavily from the dissenting opinion in the ruling.

US president accuses top court of ‘exercising raw political power’

“We cannot allow an out of control Supreme Court, working in conjunction with extremist elements of the Republican Party, to take away freedoms and our personal autonomy,” he said.
President Biden instead laid out how abortion rights could be secured by voters if they elected more pro-choice senators, and noted the Supreme Court majority opinion referred to women’s “political power.”  
“I don’t think the court, or for that matter Republicans ... have a clue about the power of American women,” he said, adding he believed women would turn out in record numbers in November’s mid-term election to restore women’s rights. He also cited recent reports that a 10-year-old girl in Ohio was forced to travel to Indiana to have an abortion after she was raped.
“Imagine being a little girl. Just imagine being a little girl, 10 years old. Does anyone believe that?,” he said.
Asked what exactly could change for women immediately after the order was signed, Jen Klein, director of the president’s Gender Policy Council at the White House afterwards, did not name any specifics.
“You can’t solve by executive action what the Supreme Court has done,” she said.
Still, progressive lawmakers and abortion rights groups welcomed the executive order. Senator Elizabeth Warren called it “important first steps” and asked the administration to explore every available option to protect abortion rights.
Priority for Democrats
Protecting abortion rights is a top issue for women Democrats and more than 70 percent of Americans think the issue should be left to a woman and her doctor.
Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said “Democrats are out of touch with the American people”.
Biden condemned the court’s ruling last month and proposed that senators remove a legislative roadblock by temporarily lifting the Senate “filibuster” to restore abortion rights. The suggestion was shot down by aides to key Democratic senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin.
Earlier in June, sources said the White House was unlikely to take the bold steps on abortion access that Democratic lawmakers have called for, such as court reform or offering reproductive services on federal lands.
On Friday, Biden directed the health department to protect and expand access to “medication abortion” approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Experts have said a pill used to terminate early pregnancies is unlikely to become available without a prescription for years.
He also directed the department to ensure women have access to emergency medical care, family planning services, and contraception.
The Supreme Court’s ruling restored states’ ability to ban abortion. As a result, women with unwanted pregnancies face the choice of travelling to another state where the procedure remains legal and available, buying abortion pills online, or having a potentially dangerous illegal abortion.
The issue may help drive Democrats to the polls in the November mid-term elections, when Republicans have a chance of taking control of Congress.

1,US rescinds Afghanistan’s ally status,Move brings to end almost 20 years of military and security engagement between US and Aghanistan.,"WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden has rescinded Afghanistan’s designation as a major non-Nato ally, formally ending almost 20 years of military and security engagement with the country. 
“In accordance with section 517 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (22 U.S.C. 2321k), I am providing notice of my intent to rescind the designation of Afghanistan as a Major NonNATO Ally,” President Biden wrote in a letter he sent to Congress earlier this week. 
As a major non-Nato ally, Afghanistan too was eligible to receive military training and assistance, including expediting the sale and leasing of military equipment even after Nato troops left the country. 
The United States still has 18 such allies around the globe, including Pakistan. US relations with Pakistan soured in 2011 when Al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden was discovered, and subsequently eliminated in Abbottabad. 
Despite the tensions, the United States and Pakistan often cooperate on major international issues. Pakistan also played a key role in negotiating the deal with the Taliban that ended the Afghan war. 
America’s other major non-Nato allies include Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Colombia, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, New Zealand, the Philippines, Qatar, South Korea, Thailand and Tunisia. 
In August 2021, the Biden administration withdrew all US troops from Afghanistan, suddenly ending nearly 20 years of war. Since then, the United States has gradually reduced its engagement with Afghanistan, although it still provides humanitarian assistance when needed. The only unresolved issue between the US and Afghanistan is that of the $7bn of Afghan assets withheld by the US Central Bank.

2,Early morning flights banned in Lahore after bird strikes,Ban to remain in place from July 11 to Sept 15; landing to be allowed after 15 minutes of advance notice in emergency cases.,"RAWALPINDI: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has banned flights from taking off or landing at the Lahore airport for two months starting from July 11 to avoid bird strikes. 
A CAA spokesperson said on Friday the authority had taken important steps to make air travel safer in view of the increasing number of birds during monsoon.
He said the landing of planes at Lahore’s Allama Iqbal International Airport would be banned from July 11 to Sept 15 from 5am to 8am. 
All domestic and foreign airlines have been instructed to issue notices and adhere to strict time limits.
However, in case of emergency, the aircraft would be allowed to land at the airport after 15 minutes of advance notice. 
The CAA has issued a notice to airmen, or NOTAM, to ensure safe air travel at the airport after a noticeable increase in the incidents of bird strikes on planes in the last few weeks. All take-offs and landings at the airport between 5am and 8am had been banned from July 11, the notice said. 
It has also launched an awareness campaign regarding flight safety and avoiding bird hazards. 
Meanwhile, Aviation Minister Khawaja Saad Rafique visited the Multan airport on Friday and directed the airport management to provide better facilities to air travellers. 
Mr Rafique also directed the management to arrange additional seats for the convenience of passengers and ensure the supply of good-quality items to passengers.
The aviation minister said the shortage of Federal Investigation Agency’s immigration staff at the airport would be addressed soon. 
He also directed the airport management to take immediate steps to increase the airport’s revenue. 
An integrated airport entry strategy will be chalked out for visitors who come to see off their family members, friends and others.
The performance of national institutions could be improved by personal interest, he said, adding that restructuring Pakistan International Airlines was a top priority.

3,Indian journalist Zubair granted bail but will remain in detention,"KARACHI: India’s top court on Friday granted bail to journalist Mohammad Zubair, who was accused of insulting ...","KARACHI: India’s top court on Friday granted bail to journalist Mohammad Zubair, who was accused of insulting Hindu religious leaders on Twitter, after his arrest last month raised concerns over media freedom, according to a Dawn.com report.
But Zubair, who co-founded fact-checking website Alt News and regularly tweets on the increasing marginalisation of India’s Muslim minority, will remain in police custody due to another complaint filed in the capital New Delhi.
A complaint filed in June in the Sitapur district of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh alleged that Zubair had hurt religious sentiments by describing a group of Hindu religious leaders as “hate mongers”, according to a court document.
Ruling on the Sitapur complaint, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court granted interim bail to Zubair for five days, and also ordered him to refrain from tweeting and tampering with any electronic evidence.
According to The Print, an Indian online newspaper, the journalist has been nominated in two separate cases, registered by the UP police and Delhi police, respectively, and the interim bail was granted only for the former.
Delhi police had arrested Zubair in June after accusing him of insulting religious beliefs on Twitter.
The FIR registered by the UP police was based on a complaint by Bhagwan Sharan, who identifies himself as the district head of Rashtriya Hindu Sher Sena, The Wire reported. The Wire is an Indian nonprofit news and opinion website.
According to the publication, a UP court had sent Zubair on 14-day judicial remand. It had also rejected the journalist’s bail application later and sent him to the police custody from July 8 to 14.
Subsequently, Zubair had approached the Supreme Court to quash the FIR registered by the UP police on July 7.
His counsel, Advocate Colin Gonsalves, told the court on Friday, “A person who made hate speech has been granted bail but secular tweeter who exposed the venomous language has been jailed.”
The matter will now be heard by a regular bench.
Zubair had reportedly played a role in drawing attention to incendiary remarks recently made by Nupur Sharma, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, that sparked widespread protests across the Muslim world.
Amnesty International had earlier said that India was “targeting” Zubair for his “crucial work” combating disinformation and calling out discrimination against minorities.

4,"Israeli PM, defence minister speak to Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas ahead of Biden visit","Abbas stressed “the need to create a [positive] atmosphere before the visit of President Biden”, says report.","

PALESTINIAN President Mahmud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid.

 
RAMALLAH: Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas spoke with Israel’s prime minister on Friday after a rare meeting with the Jewish state’s defence minister, days ahead of US President Joe Biden’s regional visit.
The phone call between Abbas and Prime Minister Yair Lapid took place early in the morning, according to a statement by the premier’s office, and was the first conversation between the two leaders since Lapid took over from Naftali Bennett last week.
“The two spoke about the continuation of cooperation and the need to ensure quiet and calm,” Lapid’s office said.
The telephone call came shortly after a rare meeting between Israel’s Defence Minister Benny Gantz and Mahmud Abbas in Ramallah, headquarters of the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, six months after the two officials last held talks in Israel.
Gantz travelled to Ramallah to mark Eidul Azha and “discuss security and civilian coordination ahead of the visit of US President Biden to Israel”, Gantz’s office said in a brief statement.
The meeting came less than a week before Biden visits as part of his first Middle East tour as US president.
Abbas “stressed the importance of creating a political horizon” between Israelis and Palestinians and “the need to create a (positive) atmosphere before the visit of President Biden”, the official Palestinian news agency WAFA said.
“The meeting was conducted in positive terms,” Gantz’s office said. “The parties discussed regional civilian and security challenges (and) agreed to continue security coordination and to avoid activities that may cause instability.” 
Mahmud Abbas and Benny Gantz, a former Israeli army chief who heads the centrist Blue and White party, met in December in Israel, sparking a heated debate in Israeli political circles.
Lapid’s predecessor Bennett refused to meet Abbas.
Biden is due to visit Israel and the occupied West Bank from July 13 to 15, and plans to hold talks with Lapid and Abbas before heading to Saudi Arabia.
After a visit to Paris this week, where he met French President Emmanuel Macron, Lapid said he did not rule out a meeting with Abbas, but said it was “not a priority” in the run-up to Israeli elections on Nov 1.

5,Haj pilgrims brave extreme desert heat to fulfil ‘divine duty’,"MAKKAH: The Haj pilgrimage can be physically draining even in ideal conditions, but worshippers this year face an...","MAKKAH: The Haj pilgrimage can be physically draining even in ideal conditions, but worshippers this year face an added challenge: scorching sun and temperatures rising to 42 degrees Celsius. 
Muslims who have flocked to western Saudi Arabia for the five-day ritual, most of which takes place in the open air, have been confronted with a stark reminder of how warming trends are exacerbating what was already a very hot desert climate.
Many have been seen trying to shield themselves with umbrellas, prayer mats and even, in one case, a small bucket filled with water.
“I am fine. I am really enjoying it, even though this heat is something I have never experienced before,” Noliha, a 61-year-old woman from Brunei who gave only her first name, said. “I really love it because I am in Mecca and doing my first Haj. I just cover my head with a hat instead of using the umbrella.”
Since 2017 Haj has fallen at least partly in July and August, the hottest months in Saudi Arabia. This has trained the spotlight on rising temperatures that environmental activists say must be addressed by a fast transition away from fossil fuels. 
“The scorching temperatures that the Arabian Gulf region and most notably Saudi Arabia are currently experiencing will soon become the norm,” warned Julien Jreissati, regional programme director for Greenpeace. 
“The average regional temperature increase due to climate change is considerably higher than the global one and projections are clearly showing that outdoor activities in summer, such as the Haj pilgrimage, will become impossible”.
Authorities are allowing one million pilgrims, including 850,000 from overseas, to participate in this year’s Haj, a major increase after pandemic restrictions kept that number to 60,000 last year and even fewer the year before that.
‘God will help us’
Summer in one of the hottest and most humid regions on earth means suffering for anyone doing anything outdoors — along with risks of dehydration, heat stroke and heart failure. 
Outside the Grand Mosque in Makkah, officials have arranged for water to be sprayed out of long poles to provide some relief. 
A few metres away, white-robed pilgrims have sought refuge on the cold marble floors in the shaded entrance of a shopping centre while awaiting the next prayer.
“I am covering my head because of the heat. It is too strong. But God will help us,” said Mostapha Zreqa, 57, an Algerian pilgrim protecting his head with a prayer mat.
The pilgrims moved on Thursday to white air-conditioned tents in Mina, around seven kilometres from the Grand Mosque. On Friday comes the high point of the Haj at Mount Arafat. Pilgrims will spend the whole day on the mountain, praying under the sun. While hundreds of buses transported pilgrims to Mina on Thursday, some chose to brave the heat and walk.
“Anything is tolerable as long as it’s for God,” said 44-year-old Tunisian pilgrim Haled bin Jomaa, arriving on foot at the Mina encampment.
Saudi officials have touted their preparations for the extreme conditions, highlighting hundreds of hospital beds allocated for heat stroke patients as well as the “large number of misting fans” they have provided. 
A truck has also been allocated to distribute umbrellas, water bottles and small fans. Nevertheless, the National Centre for Meteorology, which has set up an office in Mina, is sending warnings to pilgrims on their mobile phones, urging them to avoid outdoor rituals at certain times of the day, especially at noon.
“The importance of meteorological information has increased... due to the current global climatic conditions,” said the centre’s spokesman, Hussein al-Qahtani, noting that it was providing hourly weather reports.
“The authorities working on the ground with pilgrims are keen to draw from this information,” he added.
Some phones, however, may not be up to the task of delivering the updates to their users. “Warning! temperature too high to use your phone,” said one message received by an AFP journalist in Mina on Thursday.
