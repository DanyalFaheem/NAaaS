0,Imran calls on ‘courageous’ PTI youth to guard polling stations,Expresses fears that neither government nor “establishment” want free and fair elections.,"SARGODHA/ISLAMABAD: While calling out the usual suspects for rigging that he fears might take place in the upcoming by-polls on 20 Punjab Assembly seats, PTI chief Imran Khan on Thursday asked “ten courageous youths” in each area to guard polling stations to thwart such attempts. 
On Friday, Mr Khan addressed back-to-back rallies in Khushab and Kahuta to campaign for PTI’s candidates, where he censured his political rivals and the chief election commissioner. 
“I have come to you to tell that this is not just a by-election. This election will decide whether we accept these thieves or we want to be a sovereign and independent Pakistan,” said Mr Khan.  
He urged the youth to “take responsibility” and guard each and every polling station in their areas. 
While calling out the chief election commissioner, PML-N and PPP leaders, Mr Khan also, referred to a “Mr X” with a warning to refrain from rigging the polls in the PML-N’s favor. Without mentioning a name, Mr Khan claimed that “Mr X”, who is sitting in Lahore, is colluding with PML-N leaders to rig the polls.

Warns ‘Mr X’ to refrain from rigging, demands ‘neutrals’ stay away from polls; claims CEC, PPP, PML-N sabotaged plans to introduce EVMs

Mr Khan, once again, criticised Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, who he claimed was “bowing in front of Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shahbaz.” 
He also claimed that the federal government had handed over a lucrative posting to the CEC’s spouse in the customs department. 
“This time, the chief election commissioner is fully prepared for rigging. I just saw today that his wife has been given a post where [she could] make a lot of money. She was posted in Customs,” said Mr Khan. 
However, he warned the alleged conspirators that the scale of rigging required to fix the polls in favor of “thieves” would be so massive that “it would discredit the whole exercise” and the country would further descend into anarchy. 
He added that he tried to introduce electronic voting machines to root out rigging but the move was sabotaged by the PPP, PML-N and the CEC. 
“We worked hard to introduce EVMs to ensure the end of election rigging in last two years but the chief election commissioner and the two main political parties PPP and PML-N blocked the move,” said Khan. 
While referring to the difference in the democracy in the UK and Pakistan, Mr Khan said that the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was aksed by his own party to quite the office for holding a gathering at the time of lockdown during the pandemic. 
On the other hand, in Pakistan, he said, “the PPP and PML-N leaders know that Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Zardari are corrupt but they don’t have to courage to demand their resignation.” 
Establishment, govt don’t want free and fair election 
In a separate development on Thursday, Mr Khan expressed his fears that neither the government, nor the “establishment” want free and fair elections. 
“I am afraid neither the PDM parties, who have perfected the art of rigging over the years want free and fair elections, nor does our Establishment,” a tweet from Mr Khan’s official handle reads. 

 





 
He also referred to a report which claimed that 130 out of 163 methods of rigging could be eliminated with the use of EVMs. 
The report by an organisation Pattan claimed that 163 illegal and unethical means were being used to influence will of the electorates and results of polls in Pakistan. 
“This Pattan Report once again makes it obvious why these two criminal family mafias opposed the EVM machines as did the shamefully biased & controlled ECP. With EVMs 130 out of 163 ways of rigging elections in Pak would have been eliminated,” another tweet reads. 
The report recommended minimizing human involvement in the elections which as envisioned in the sections 94 and 104 of the Elections Act 2017 and appealed the political leadership to foster democracy within their parties. 
The political class must not seek support from the establishment to win the elections and the ECP must take concrete steps to make election staff free from the influence of political parties, the report suggested. 
‘Neutrals’ support in July 17 polls will damage the country’ 
Before embarking on the journey to address the rallies, Mr Khan addressed electronic media journalists at his Zaman Park residence in Lahore in which he demanded the “neutrals” to stay away from the polling process. 
""If the neutrals support rigging in the July 17 by-elections, they will further damage the country,” he asserted. 
He regretted that the Punjab government with the help of administration is making all out efforts to rig the polls which, he warned, will invite the public’s wrath.

1,Will the UK finally have its first ‘Brown’ PM,"Sajid Javid has the experience and Rishi Sunak the charm, but polls clearly favour Ben Wallace.","

Sajid Javid

 
LONDON: From political pundits and bookies to ‘psychic’ seals and fortune tellers, the question of who will be the Conservative party’s next leader — and the UK prime minister — is being hotly debated on screens, at homes and in pubs across the UK.
Since Boris Johnson’s resignation on July 7 was forced by junior ministers, around 10 names have been floated as contenders for the key slot, though not all of them have said that they want the job. Half of these MPs and ministers are from ethnic minority backgrounds.
In 2021, 14 per cent of the UK population was from a minority ethnic background. Following the 2019 general election, six cabinet members and 10pc of Members of the House of Commons were from ethnic minority backgrounds. 
Sajid Javid has held various cabinet positions and is widely believed to be a man to watch for the race. Born to Pakistani immigrants from Toba Tek Singh who moved to the UK in the 1960s, Javid was born in Rochdale and grew up in Bristol. He has served in several cabinet positions under three Tory PMs since 2012, even getting the top job of home secretary in 2018. 

Sajid Javid has the experience, Rishi Sunak the charm; polls clearly favour Ben Wallace

Most recently, he was in Johnson’s cabinet as health secretary. Appointed to the post as the UK was in the throes of the pandemic, Javid authored a ‘post-crisis blueprint’ for how to renew growth across every part of the UK. In the past, Javid made a bid for the Conservative party leader post but bowed out to support Johnson.
It was Javid’s dramatic resignation letter this week that triggered the avalanche of government departures which eventually sealed Johnson’s fate. 


Ben Wallace

 
He wrote, “The tone you [Johnson] set as a leader, and the values you represent, reflect on your colleagues, your party and ultimately the country. Conser­vatives at their best are seen as hard-headed decision-makers, guided by strong values. We may not have always been popular, but we have been competent in acting in the national interest.  
“Sadly, in the current circumstances, the public are concluding that we are now neither. The vote of confidence last month showed that a large number of our colleagues agree. It was a moment for humility, grip and new direction. I regret to say, however, that it is clear to me that this situation will not change under your leadership — and you have therefore lost my confidence too.”
With his letter, seen by many as a veiled leadership bid, Javid in recent days is seen as having set the direction for the Tory party, though a common criticism against him is that he has not served in any cabinet position long enough to have had an impact. 
While Javid is seen as a serious contender by analysts, a snap YouGov poll of Conservative party members revealed he was not even among the top five leading candidates.
Though the YouGov poll places Ben Wallace as a clear favourite to win the top slot in the Conservative party, Rishi Sunak, another cabinet member and ethnic minority politician, is not too far behind. Born to Indian parents and married to the daughter of an Indian billionaire, Oxford and Stanford-educated Sunak became MP in 2015. Just five years later, he was Johnson’s chief financial minister. 


Rishi Sunak

 
According to the BBC, Sunak is “one of the first to quit the cabinet … and the most high-profile figure so far to announce his candidacy”. 
Sunak was seen as a hot favourite for the slot of PM for months, with research published in December 2021 showing the ex-chancellor had a better chance of challenging Keir Starmer’s Labour than Johnson. Papers at the time featured headline after headline about ‘Dishy Rishi’ and how he would be the ideal candidate for a Tory MP in the event that Johnson stepped down. 
The media’s darling, Sunak was even described by a commentator in January this year as “the only choice” as he was then “untainted by scandal”. Unfortunately for the chancellor, the controversy over his wife’s tax affairs and a fine for breaching lockdown rules seriously dented his reputation. Still, the YouGov poll shows Sunak as the closest contender to Wallace in a separate head-to-head poll.
Other key contenders from ethnic minority backgrounds include Nadhim Zahawi, born in Iraq and the replacement for Sunak who resigned soon after Javid. Indian-origin Attorney General for England and Wales Suella Braverman and Home Secretary Priti Patel, too, are being floated as names for the top slot, though the odds that either will win appear slim.
Currently, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace is leading the poll. A former soldier who became MP in 2005, Wallace has won international recognition for his leadership during the Ukraine crisis. He served in the army in Germany, Cyprus, Belize and Northern Ireland where he helped thwart a bomb attack by the Irish Republican Army. At present, Wallace is dodging questions about whether he will run for leadership, insisting he will continue to focus on his job.
On the question of whether the UK is ready for its first ethnic minority PM, Jonathan Portes, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the School of Politics and Economics of King’s College, told Dawn, “Yes. Sunak, Javid and Nadhim Zahawi are all plausible contenders [Suella Braverman, who has also announced her candidacy, less so]. But their success or failure will not be determined by their ethnicities, but by their policies and personalities.”

2,Japan reels as gunman assassinates ‘longest serving PM’,"NARA: Former prime minister Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving leader of modern Japan, was gunned down on Friday while...","NARA: Former prime minister Shinzo Abe, the longest-serving leader of modern Japan, was gunned down on Friday while campaigning for a parliamentary election, shocking a country where political violence had become almost unthinkable. 
Abe, 67, was pronounced dead around five and a half hours after the shooter ope­ned fire on him from behind as he spoke to members of the public from a drab traffic island in the western city of Nara. Authorities arres­ted a 41-year-old man. Japa­nese media reported that the weapon appeared to be a homemade gun.
“I am simply speechless over the news of Abe’s death,” Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Abe’s protégé, told reporters.
Earlier, as Abe still lay in hospital where doctors tried to revive him, Kishida struggled to keep his emotions in check.
“This attack is an act of brutality that happened during the elections — the very foundation of our demo­cracy — and is absolutely unforgivable,” he said.
Abe had been making a campaign speech outside a train station when two shots rang out. Security officials were then seen tackling a man in a grey T-shirt and beige trousers. 
“There was a loud bang and then smoke,” businessman Makoto Ichikawa, who was at the scene, said. “The first shot, no one knew what was going on, but after the second shot, what looked like special police tackled him.” 
Kyodo news service published a photograph of Abe lying face-up on the street by a guardrail, blood on his white shirt. People were crowded around him, one administering heart massage.
Abe was taken to hospital in cardiopulmonary arrest and showing no vital signs. He was declared dead at 5.03pm, having bled to death from deep wounds to the heart and the right side of his neck. 
He had received more than 100 units of blood in transfusions over four hours, Hidetada Fukushima, the professor in charge of emergency medicine at Nara Medical University Hospital, told a televised news conference. 
NHK quoted the suspected shooter, identified as Tetsuya Yamagami, as telling police he was dissatisfied with Abe and wanted to kill him. The suspect told police he had made multiple handmade explosives and guns in the past, NHK said.
Police said the suspected shooter was a resident of Nara. Media said he had served in Japan’s military for three years until 2005.
Members of the public laid flowers near the spot where Abe fell. TV Asahi reported that Abe’s body would be transferred to his Tokyo home on Saturday.
It was the first killing of a sitting or former Japanese leader since a 1936 coup attempt, when several figures including two ex-premiers were assassinated.
Post-war Japan prides itself on its orderly and open democracy. Senior Japanese politicians are accompanied by armed security agents but often get close to the public, especially during political campaigns when they make roadside speeches and shake hands with passersby.
In 2007, the mayor of Nagasaki was shot and killed by a yakuza gangster. The head of the Japan Socialist Party was assassinated during a speech in 1960 by a right-wing youth with a samurai short sword. A few other prominent politicians have been attacked but not injured. 
Abe served two terms as prime minister, stepping down in 2020 citing ill health. But he remained a dominant presence over the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), controlling one of its major factions.
Kishida, who won the premiership with Abe’s backing, said the LDP would continue election campaigning on Saturday to demonstrate its resolve to “never give in to violence”, and to defend a “free and fair election at all cost”. 
Speaking on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in Indonesia, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the assassination of Abe “shocking” and “profoundly disturbing” and described him as a leader of great vision. 
The United States is Japan’s most important ally.
Similar messages of sympathy and shock poured in from around the world following news of Abe’s death, including from neighbouring Taiwan, China and Russia, as well as from across Asia, Europe and the United States. 
Abe is best known for his Abenomics policy of aggressive monetary easing and fiscal spending. He also bolstered defence spending after years of declines and expanded the military’s ability to project power abroad.
In a historic shift in 2014, his government reinterpreted the postwar, pacifist constitution to allow troops to fight overseas for the first time since World War Two.
The following year, legislation ended a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defence, or defending a friendly country under attack.
Abe, however, never achieved his goal of revising the US-drafted constitution by writing the Self-Defense Forces, as Japans military is known, into the pacifist Article 9.
Abe first took office in 2006 as Japan’s youngest prime minister since World War Two. After a year plagued by political scandals, voter outrage at lost pension records, and an election drubbing for his ruling party, Abe quit citing ill health.
He became prime minister again in 2012. Abe hailed from a wealthy political family that included a foreign minister father and a grandfather who served as premier.

4,Situationer: Are more LNG terminals necessary if no one is selling?,"Less than 50pc of annual LNG imports are through the spot market, where prices skyrocketed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.","Here’s a thought: fuel shortages wouldn’t be as severe as they are today had bureaucrats not thrown a spanner in the works of two long-delayed LNG terminals.
One may be tempted to cite the recent defaults by LNG suppliers under long-term contracts alongside record-high prices on the spot market to declare that the need for more LNG terminals has become moot.
But before leaping to conclusions, consider the following: it’s not sovereign-backed Qatar Energy that’s been defaulting on long-term contracts; rather the international trading houses — Eni and Gunvor — that have defaulted on promised cargoes and messed up the country’s power sector.
One of the two planned terminals is backed mainly by Qatar and has three local industrial groups as minority shareholders. After six years of navigating the regulatory rigmarole, the terminal is still a distant dream. Had the terminal received the promised pipeline capacity from Sui companies in time, it would’ve been importing Qatari gas under long-term contracts already, for onwards sale to the local industry, without the need for any sovereign guarantees.
The other planned terminal is wholly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation, one of the most influential players in the global energy market. No LNG trader in the world would’ve defaulted on its cargoes because the Japanese player is responsible for more than half the LNG imported every year by Japan, one of the biggest gas importers worldwide.
Impact of Ukraine war
Pakistan began importing LNG in 2015 as domestic gas reserves started depleting at a faster pace. The country has already installed two terminals on Port Qasim. Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd uses the Engro Elengy Terminal to import gas under long-term contracts, while Pakistan LNG Ltd brings spot purchases through the GasPort LNG Terminal.
Less than 50 per cent of annual LNG imports are through the spot market, where prices skyrocketed after the Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb 24. Little wonder that no bidder responded to the latest tenders by Pakistan LNG Ltd for 10 cargoes. Before that, the state-owned company made three unsuccessful attempts to buy LNG in July.
As for the four long-term contracts meant to bring more than half of the country’s total LNG imports at substantially lower than spot rates, there have been constant defaults by global suppliers. Since the beginning of 2021, Eni has defaulted on at least four cargoes while Gunvor has defaulted on at least seven, according to data compiled by the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.
Force majeure or not?
Pakistan reserves the right to impose a penalty on defaulting suppliers equalling 30pc of the cargo cost. Suppliers invoke force majeure — unforeseeable circumstances preventing them from fulfilling the contract — to avoid paying the penalty.
“Long-term contracts must always require the supplier to disclose the fuel source and the vessel’s name. Otherwise, what’s stopping it from selling the cargo on the spot market whenever the rate is high enough to justify a default on long-term deliveries?” said an energy expert with many years of LNG procurement experience for European employers.
It’s difficult to invoke force majeure on a false pretext if the long-term buyer knows the source of LNG and the vessel that’s supposed to deliver it.
The developers of both upcoming terminals have repeatedly asked the government to allocate at least 300 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of pipeline capacity each before they take the final investment decision (FID), however, there has been little tangible progress from the state-owned gas utility companies on the allocation of pipeline during the past few years.
Qatar-backed Energas LNG and Mitsubishi-backed Tabeer LNG have capacities of 750-1,000mmcfd each. Given the capacities of the already-operational Engro Elengy (690mmcfd) and GasPort LNG (750mmcfd), the addition of the two “merchant” terminals can more than double the country’s re-gasification capacity. They will also increase the country’s LNG storage capacity, which currently stands at 320,000 cubic metres. 
Pakistan is one of the top seven LNG importers globally, yet it ranks as low as 18th in terms of storage capacity. As a matter of fact, the country uses the existing Floating Storage and Re-gasification Units (FSRUs) of the existing two terminals merely as re-gasification units. This means the system relies heavily on the gas line-pack, which is the volume that can be stored in a pipeline for scheduling purposes.
According to a July 4 report by Reuters, Germany has leased as many as four FSRUs in a bid to quickly diversify away from Russian energy. “But here, foreign investors have been running from pillar to post for years just to get the promised pipeline capacity,” said the energy expert.

5,Punjab by-polls on old electoral lists as PTI alleges new votes added,"ECP rubbishes ""baseless propaganda"" on illegal registration of voters, says reports aimed at misleading the masses.","• Asad Umar claims voters being ‘illegally’ registered in by-poll constituencies
• ECP rubbishes ‘baseless propaganda’ on illegal registration of voters
ISLAMABAD: With the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) sticking to its allegations that attempts are being made to rig the upcoming by-polls in Punjab, the election commission has announced that the exe­rcise in 20 constituencies of the province will be held on the basis of old electoral rolls.
In a statement issued on Friday, the Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan (ECP) said the media reports regarding registration of votes were “unfounded and based on propaganda to mislead the masses”.
ECP spokesman Haroon Shinwari pointed out that the electoral rolls were frozen after the announcement of the poll schedule and could not be changed under the law. No vote could be added or deleted nor could a change in the particulars of voters be made till the culmination of the electoral process, he added.
Rejecting the “propaganda” about registration of voters as baseless, the spok­e­sman said the ECP in cooperation with other institutions was determined to hold free and fair elections in the 20 provincial assembly constituencies of Punjab.
An ECP official, talking to Dawn, also said the PTI’s stepped-up campaign against the commission appears to be linked to the foreign funding case against the party. He pointed out that the tirade against ECP and its chief had gone to a new level after the commission reserved its verdict in the case.
He maintained the case will be decided on merit without succumbing to any pressure whatsoever.
‘Test for ECP, courts’
Meanwhile, former federal minister and PTI Secretary General Asad Umar once again alleged that voters’ lists were being changed to rig the upcoming by-polls in Punjab.
Speaking at a press conference, he alleged voters were being illegally registered in these constituencies. He said the law “clearly says votes cannot be changed once the election date is announced”, but claimed new votes had been registered in the electoral rolls issued.
“They are mostly those whose temporary or permanent addresses do not fall in that constituency [...] It is a test for the [Election Commission of Pakistan] and courts.” He said petitions had already been filed but regretted the ECP had not taken any action.
Criticising the electoral watchdog, Umar advised it to allot itself an election symbol as well since it was “behaving like a political party”. He warned that the country could get into a “difficult situation” if the public saw the ECP was “not doing justice or behaving like a silent spectator over violations of law”.
Several PTI leaders, including its chief and former prime minister Imran Khan, have in recent days leveled allegations of interference to change the results of the upcoming by-polls. They have also alleged change in voters’ lists and the use of state machinery to benefit former PTI lawmakers contesting the July 17 polls with the backing of ruling parties.
Editorial: Road to Islamabad runs through Lahore, and Punjab by-poll results may well reflect national trends
In Friday’s press conference Asad Umar asked his party workers to fully prepare for the upcoming elections. ""Whatever they do, the PTI will win with a big majority on July 17. Once Punjab goes out of their (the government’s) hands, what will the imported prime minister do in Islamabad? We are heading towards new elections.”
Citing ‘surveys’, he insisted the PTI was “leading prominently” in all constituencies they had visited.
“And it is not surprising, especially with the extraordinary increase in Imran Khan’s popularity in the last few months,” he added. “And the most welcome aspect is that all the different social sectors of the nation, from the lowest-earning to the most educated, are uniting.”
“By-elections will be held on the 17th and then chief minister’s election on 22nd, after which this story will come to an end,” the former minister said. “But they are not ready to go away so easily.”
He lamented how the law and the Constitution were allegedly “being violated” and the people “harassed and terrorised”. He further alleged that assistant commissioners and district commissioners were making “direct calls” to officials in Punjab. “Our people are being threatened and cases registered,” he added.
In response to a question, the PTI secretary general said the party’s fight was against injustice, undemocratic attitudes and foreign interference. “It is not against one individual, it is an ideological battle,” he emphasised.
