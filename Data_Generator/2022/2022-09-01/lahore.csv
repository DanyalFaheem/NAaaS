Justice Ali Zia Bajwa made this observation while deciding a bail petition of man who was formally indicted more than three years after his arrest in a murder case.  
“It is a classic textbook case of failure of our criminal justice system and flagrant violations of the law by its main stakeholders resulting in a complete miscarriage of justice and violation of the right to be dealt with in accordance with law,” the judge writes in his 16-page judgement.  
A report filed by the Camp Jail superintendent shows that the investigation reports have not been submitted before the trial courts in more than 70 per cent of the cases of the 3,900 under-trial prisoners.  
The judge regrets that it seems all the state functionaries responsible for the timely submission of investigation reports were in deep slumber and completely neglected their mandatory statutory duties. He says the gloomy state of affairs also exposed the ineffective mechanism of internal accountability of police and prosecution departments.  
To ensure strict adherence to the law and guidance provided by the Supreme Court, Justice Bajwa has directed the investigating agencies and the prosecution department to strictly comply with the instructions issued by the director general, directorate of district judiciary in 2021.  
The judge directs the provincial secretary for prosecution to take up the matter immediately and after determining the liability of the concerned prosecutor(s) conclude the action in accordance with the law, as the matter has already been sent to him by the prosecutor general, Punjab.  
The secretary prosecution has also been directed to take cognisance of the ineffectiveness and the poor performance of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service Inspectorate and to ensure that the law is implemented in letter and spirit for effective internal accountability of delinquents.
The judge also allowed the post-arrest bail to the petitioner, Muhammad Razzaq, on the statutory ground of delay in conclusion of trial.

During the general discussion on the floods, former provincial minister Chaudhry Zaheer suggested that Kalabagh dam should be built so that floods could be avoided.  
He said the proposed Kalabagh dam, would have stored only 10 million acre feet water, while more reservoirs would be needed to save the rest of the 25maf that went into the sea during the recent floods.
He demanded that those affected by the floods should be given state land to build their homes and that standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be devised to ban construction within 220 yards of a riverbed.
PML-N MPA Raheela Khadim Hussain regretted that neither the ‘judicial’ chief minister nor the parliamentarians were attending the assembly session when it was discussing the flood situation in the province.
She said Chief Minister Parvez Elahi, along with his son, was appearing in the “court” of Imran Khan instead of paying attention to the problems of the flood-hit people.
Mehwish Sultana said cotton crop had been badly damaged by the floods, while it was unlikely that the farmers would be able to sow the next wheat crop in the Rabi season.
She said the floodwaters also washed away precious livestock of the poor farmers.  
She also demanded the government to construct Kalabagh and other dams to tame the river water and hill torrents to avert flooding and save water for agriculture and other purposes.
PTI’s Zaheer Abbas Khokhar demanded a judicial commission to ascertain the reasons behind such massive flooding and assess the losses caused by the calamity.
Yawar Abbas Bukhari regretted that both the PPP and the PTI were vocal on the flood issue, while both parties had been opposing the Kalabagh dam that could have mitigated the situation.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Raja Bisharat assured the house that the affected-hit people would be treated in the best possible way regardless of their political affiliations. The minister also tabled the University of Kamalia Bill 2022, which was passed by the house with a majority vote.
After completion of the agenda of the sitting, the proceedings were postponed till 3pm on Wednesday next (Sept 7).

15,‘Medical mafia’ failing pro-people Sehat Sahulat Programme in Lahore,Patients who want to avail health card being put on long waiting lists.,"LAHORE: It seems most of the private healthcare outlets and senior doctors of the public sector hospitals are in a tacit agreement to discredit the Sehat Sahulat Programme (health card), which is evident from growing disappointment among the public (card holders) with regard to this pro-people initiative taken by the last Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government. 
It has transpired that a majority of private hospitals either do not accept health card for treatment of diseases covered under the programme, or use delaying tactics in treatment of those who want to avail the facility. 
Cases are surfacing in the private and public sector hospitals of the provincial capital where the patients are being refused treatment under the Sehat Sahulat Pogramme, while the government functionaries are making tall claims about its success. 
A citizen, who wished not to be named, told Dawn that he took his seven-year-old son, Abu Bakar, complaining of acute pain in testicles to the paediatrics surgery OPD of a private healthcare facility in Shadman in Lahore. “The doctors, after necessary diagnostic tests and ultrasound, concluded that the child is suffering from ‘right sided hydrocele’, prescribing surgery,” the father said. 

Patients who want to avail health card being put on long waiting lists

Hydrocele is a type of swelling in the scrotum that occurs when fluid accumulates in the thin sheath surrounding a testicle. 
The father says that when he asked the doctors to conduct the surgery through health card, they simply told him that they offer the procedure only in two categories – private and semi-private. On further inquiry, he was told the private treatment would cost around Rs100,000 and under the semi-private option he would have to pay Rs80,000 to Rs90,000. 
As the treatment cost was beyond the paying capacity of the middle-class family, the father insisted the surgery be conducted through the health card.  
“The doctors offered to conduct the procedure under the health card after six months, saying the hospital had a long list of patients put on schedule under the government programme,” the father said.  
He added that another senior paediatric surgeon, who had served as vice chancellor of the University of Health Sciences and principal of Allama Iqbal Medical College, also refused to perform the surgical procedure with the same excuse, but agreed to treat the boy ‘on cash’ payment. 
The dejected father says he got almost similar answers from at least ten other private hospitals in Lahore, most of them saying they don’t offer paediatric surgery. While those having such surgical facility, demanded fee “in cash” to get the job done either the same day, or within 24 hours. 
“Meanwhile, I came to know that most of the private hospitals’ surgeons were not satisfied with the fee offered to them through the health card, as they normally charge Rs50,000 for even a minor surgery like hydrocele, besides other expenses”, he says. 
He laments that the surgeons at the public sector hospitals are also putting patients on long waiting lists, or encourage them to go to private facilities, as they too were paid a meagre fee under the insurance programme. 
Similarly, a woman, Fakhira, (name changed) told this reporter that on visiting a private hospital on Jail Road for removal of gall bladder of her 26-year-old daughter after being warned of “irreversible complications” in case of delay in surgery, she was refused the treatment under Sehat Sahulat Programme. She says that she was told that some surgeries  under the health card were not “preferred” by the private sector health facilities. 
Sources in health sector say that many senior doctors and private healthcare establishments were trying to discredit this pro-people programme as they fear its success will end their hegemony. 
They say the Sehat Sahulat Programme could be a revolutionary initiative, but it seems “the medical mafias” have developed a nexus to fail it like many others taken by different governments to provide relief to the public.

After government circles and some chambers, Tehreek-i-Istaqlal has also urged that Indian trade routes should also be opened like Iran and Afghanistan for swift supply of vegetables and fruits.
Party president Rehmat Khan Wardag said here on Wednesday the government should use all avenues to provide relief to the consumers as onion and tomato prices have crossed Rs400 per kg mark.
He said that vegetables and fruit supplies in the shortest time were possible only from the neighbouring countries and as the government had already decided to open Iran and Afghan borders, it should also allow opening of Wagah border for importing kitchen items from India to bring down vegetables prices immediately.
He regretted that the PTI during its rule kept ignoring motorways as well as other CPEC projects and when the Sukkur-Moro section of the National Highway was submerged by floods, vegetables supplies from Karachi and interior Sindh were affected.
He said if the motorway section had been constructed, its higher platform would have provided a refuge to the flood victims.
TOBA TEK SINGH: Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Atif Munir urged the government to act swiftly to retain the vegetable supply chain. He said trade with the  neighboring countries was vital to reduce transportation charges.

Tarar along with his counsel appeared before the court and sought pre-arrest bail.
The court allowed the bail to the MPA till Sept 8 subject to furnishing of surety bonds.
Initially Qilla Gujjar Singh police had registered a case against the MPAs of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and PML-Q and staff of the assembly on charges of resorting to violence during the election of the chief minister wherein Hamza Shehbaz emerged victorious against Parvez Elahi.  
The MPAs of the coalition government were also charged with manhandling then deputy speaker Dost Muhammad Mazari.
Several MPAs of the PTI and PML-Q besides staff of the assembly including then secretary of the assembly Muhammad Khan Bhatti had secured pre-arrest bail from the court in the case.  
A sessions court on Monday sought a report from Qilla Gujjar Singh police on a petition of Punjab Assembly Speaker Parvez Elahi seeking registration of a FIR of alleged torture on him during the election of chief minister.
Mr Elahi had also approached the court after police refused to lodge a case on his application carrying charges of manhandling at the hands of the PML-N MPAs.
Elahi accused Hamza of orchestrating the attack on him and other MPAs in connivance with his private goons. He also accused then chief secretary, the inspector general of police and the deputy commissioner of acting at the behest of Hamza.
However, police had not registered the case due to unavailability of medical examination report of the applicant.  
After the victory of Mr Elahi in a run-off election for the chief minister, the police changed direction of its investigation towards the MPAs of PML-N and started summoning them.  
The police also got warrants from a judicial magistrate concerned for the arrest of MPAs of the PML-N including Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan, Attaullah Tarar, Sardar Awais Leghari, Saiful Malook Khokhar, Pir Khizar Hayat Khagga, Raja Sagheer Ahmad and others.
