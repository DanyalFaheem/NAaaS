0,Sadr locked into ‘zero-sum’ game for dominance of Iraq,"""Sadr is looking to become the most powerful political player in Iraq,"" one analyst says.","BAGHDAD: Iraqi cleric Moqtada Sadr may have declared his  “definitive retirement” from politics this week, but the violence that erupted after his announcement points to murkier intentions, analysts believe.
“Sadr is looking to become the most powerful political player in Iraq,” Renad Mansour of British think tank Chatham House said.
“That is his agenda, and part of achieving that requires destabilising not just the political system as such, but particularly the Shia house and building it back up with him at the centre of it.” Since the aftermath of the US-led invasion in 2003 that toppled longtime dictator Saddam Hussein, Iraq has been governed under a sectarian power-sharing system.
Sadr, whose father was one of Iraq’s most respected clerics, has gradually grown into a key political player in this landscape, bolstered by a Shia support base that he often mobilises to press his demands.
Since elections last October, disagreements between Sadr and a rival Iran-backed Shia force known as the Coordination Framework have left Iraq without a new government, prime minister or president.
Tensions escalated sharply on Monday when Sadr loyalists stormed the government palace inside the Green Zone after he announced he was quitting politics.
But Sadr’s supporters then left the Green Zone on Tuesday afternoon when he appealed for them to withdraw within the hour — a demonstration of the cult-like following that earned him his kingmaker status.
At least 30 Sadr supporters had been shot dead and nearly 600 wounded in nearly 24 hours of fighting between rival Shia factions.
“It’s not the first time he has sent protesters in and then asked them to withdraw,” Mansour said.  “His goal, his ultimate aim, is to become the main Shia political force in Iraq.”
Sadr’s bloc won 73 seats in the October elections, making it the largest faction in the 329-seat parliament.
The cleric has since tried a series of unsuccessful manoeuvres to  “secure his dominance within the political system and exclude his rivals”, said assistant professor Fanar Haddad of the University of Copenhagen.
Sadr failed to form a new government of his choosing despite attempts to forge an alliance with Sunni and Kurdish political camps.
In June, he ordered his 73 lawmakers to quit in a bid to destabilise the legislature, but that led instead to the Coordination Framework becoming the largest bloc in parliament.
The Coordination Framework’s nomination of ex-cabinet minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani as prime minister further angered Sadr who refused to be sidelined in forming a government.
Sadr’s supporters stormed parliament on July 30, demanding fresh elections, and staged a sit-in outside the legislature for weeks.
But the Coordination Framework, which wants a new head of government appointed before any new polls, has not budged. This latest episode in Baghdad’s Green Zone was another tactical failure, Haddad said.
“The Coordination Framework have offered no conciliatory remarks, or concessions, or anything of the sort” after Sadr told his supporters to withdraw, Haddad said.
“This further pushes everyone down the zero-sum path of conflicting positions... the possibility for reconciliation seems to get slimmer, not wider.”
Sadr is notorious for walking back on pledges to retire from politics — a step he has made several times over the years. His latest retirement announcement on Monday followed a series of tactical challenges to his political rise, including from within his own support base, said Sajad Jiyad, a fellow at the Century International think tank.

1,G20 climate talks end without communique,"The failure to agree upon a unified statement came at the end of a month in which more than 1,000 died in Pakistan from flooding.","BALI: Group of 20 climate talks in Bali ended without a joint communique on Wednesday despite host Indonesia warning the world’s leading economies they must act together to combat a warming planet or risk plunging into  “uncharted territory”.
The one-day meeting on the resort island concluded with Indonesia’s environment chief saying G20 chair Jakarta would only issue a summary of the forum’s aims, reflecting divisions between its members over how to tackle climate change.
The failure to agree upon a unified statement came at the end of a month in which more than 1,000 people died in Pakistan from flooding blamed on climate change and after a drought exacerbated by a record heatwave spread across half of China.
At a closing press conference, Indonesian Minister of Environment and Forestry Siti Nurbaya Bakar said the summary would detail the forum’s “shared commitment and shared steps”.
It is a similar move to that seen in finance talks in Indonesia in July where the host _ which maintains a neutral foreign policy _ issued a chair statement after ministers disagreed over Russia’s responsibility for global economic turmoil in light of its invasion of Ukraine.
“We cannot say that,” Bakar said when asked if there was no communique because of geopolitical disagreements.
“But the chair summary is something we can achieve given the geopolitical issues and (given) some countries cannot be flexible on certain issues.
“Just like in many working groups, issues on Russia and Ukraine have become geopolitical tension.” 
Another source close to the meeting said G20 members  “did not manage to reach a joint communique” and most countries started their speeches by condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, though there were no walkouts or clashes when the Russian representative spoke.
“The reason that killed the communique from the start is the presence of Russia today,” the source said.
Moscow only sent a deputy minister for economic development to the talks.
In her opening remarks Bakar told delegates that “global environmental problems require global solutions” and nations “cannot solve those global environmental problems on our own”.

2,Russian firm halts gas flow in new jitters for Europe,"IAEA wants ""permanent presence"" at Russia-held plant to avoid ""a nuclear accident"".","LUBMIN/ZAPORIZHZHIA: Rus­s­­­ian energy giant Gazprom suspended gas deliveries to Germany on a major pipeline on Wednesday, the latest in a series of supply halts that have fuelled an energy crisis in Europe.
Gazprom said supplies via Nord Stream 1 were  “completely stopped” for  “preventative work” at a compressor unit, shortly after European gas network operator ENTSOG announced that deliveries had ceased.
Gazprom has also said it would suspend gas supplies to France’s main provider Engie from Thursday after it failed to pay for all deliveries made in July.
The latest stop comes as European countries have faced soaring energy prices since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February and subsequently curbed its gas deliveries to the region. Germany, which is heavily dependent on Russian gas, has accused Moscow of using energy as a  “weapon”. But Gazprom has said the three-day maintenance work was  “necessary” and had to be be carried out after  “every 1,000 hours of operation”.With winter around the corner, European consumers are bracing for huge power bills. Some countries like France have warned that rationing is a possibility.

IAEA wants ‘permanent presence’ at Russia-held plant to avoid ‘a nuclear accident’

‘Gas emergency’
At the same time, fears over throttled supplies have also driven companies to slash their energy usage. Germany’s industry consumed 21.3 percent less gas in July than the average for the month from 2018 to 2021, said the Federal Network Agency. 
Mueller has said such pre-emptive action  “could save Germany from a gas emergency this winter”.
And Europe’s biggest economy was already racing to turn its back on Russian gas. At the German coastal city of Lubmin, where Nord Stream 1 comes onshore, plans are already well underway for the switch to liquefied natural gas (LNG).
The LNG, transported in by ships, will arrive at Lubmin’s industrial port and be converted back into gas and pumped into Gascade’s distribution network, which has so far been used to funnel Russian gas around the country.
UN  inspectors visit
UN  inspectors said on Wednesday they would seek to establish a permanent  presence at a Russian-held plant in southern Ukraine to avoid  “a  nuclear accident” at the facility on the frontline of the fighting.
The  14-strong team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is  expected to arrive at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant on Thursday which  lies inside Russian-held territory.
“My mission is... to prevent a  nuclear accident and preserve the largest nuclear power plant in  Europe,” IAEA director general Rafael Grossi told reporters after  travelling from Kyiv to the city of Zaporizhzhia.
“We are  preparing for the real work which begins tomorrow,” he said.  “We are  going to try to establish a permanent presence for the agency.” Fresh  shelling struck the town next to Europe’s largest atomic facility on  Wednesday, with the fate of the plant on the banks of the Dnipro River  stoking global concern.
“The Russian army is shelling Energodar,”  local military official Evhen Yevtushenko said on Wednesday morning, of  the town next to the plant which had a pre-war population of 50,000  people. Both sides have repeatedly traded blame over attacks in the area.
One  of the shells hit Energodar’s city council, Mayor Dmytro Orlov wrote on  Telegram, posting pictures of the damaged building with a hole punched  into the side.

3,"Don’t underrate Russia’s military strength, warns German general","BERLIN: Germany’s chief of defence has warned that the West must not underestimate Moscow’s military strength,...","BERLIN: Germany’s chief of defence has warned that the West must not underestimate Moscow’s military strength, saying Russia has the scope to open up a second front should it choose to do so. 
“The bulk of the Russian land forces may be tied down in Ukraine at the moment but, even so, we should not underestimate the Russian land forces’ potential to open a second theatre of war,” Gen Eberhard Zorn, the highest-ranking soldier of the Bundeswehr, said in an interview. 
Beyond the army, Russia also has a navy and air force at its disposal, he added.  “Most of the Russian navy has not yet been deployed in the war on Ukraine, and the Russian air force still has significant potential as well, which poses a threat to Nato too,” Zorn said. 
The Bundeswehr regularly supports Nato air policing missions over the Baltic states with fighter jets and, having one of the strongest fleets in the region, is also keeping a close eye on the developments in the Baltic Sea at its doorstep. 
One potential hotspot there is Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave sandwiched between Nato members Poland and Lithuania, that hosts Russia’s Baltic naval fleet and is a deployment location for Russian nuclear-capable Iskander missiles. 
Russia has threatened to station nuclear and hypersonic weapons in Kaliningrad should Finland and Sweden join Nato as they are in the process of doing. 
Zorn, the German defence chief, speaking before the start of a Ukrainian offensive in the south, stressed that Russia continued to have substantial reserves.  
“As concerns its military, Russia is very well capable of expanding the conflict regionally,” the general said.  “That this would be a very unreasonable thing for Russia to do is a different story.”

4,ICC calls for resumption of Afghan war crimes probe,The International Crim­inal Court’s Afghanistan investigation has been on hold for more than two years.,"THE HAGUE: A year into the Taliban’s rule, war crimes prosecutors in The Hague have urged judges to rule promptly on their request to resume investigations into atrocities in Afghanistan and warn that crimes are continuing, court documents showed.
The International Crim­inal Court’s Afghanistan investigation has been on hold for more than two years. In March 2020 the previous Afghan government had asked it to be suspended while they investigated suspected war crimes themselves.
In documents released on ICC’s website this week and dated Aug 26, prosecutor Karim Khan argued Afgha­nistan’s request to suspend the probe should be rejected, citing a lack of effort by authorities there to pursue justice in domestic courts.
He said the Taliban  “have not continued, cannot continue and do not intend to continue the relevant investigations and prosecutions” that formed the basis of the request for suspension by the ousted government.
“To the contrary, the available information suggests that serious crimes within the jurisdiction of the court (...) continue to be committed,” he added, urging judges to allow the probe the be  “promptly resumed”.
In September last year, Khan already announced he would ask judges to resume the probe into crimes by the Taliban and ISIS-K. He added prosecutors would  “deprioritise” looking into suspected crimes by US forces and Afghan government troops.
In July, the UN mission in Afghanistan said that the ruling Taliban were responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture, arbitrary arrests and inhumane punishments in the months since they toppled the previous government and seized power after Washington’s withdrawal from the country.

5,Sri Lanka strikes initial loan pact with IMF,The debt-laden country has been seeking up to $3 billion from the global lender.,"COLOMBO: Crisis-hit Sri Lanka has reached a preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a bailout, four sources with direct knowledge of the plan have said.
The debt-laden country has been seeking up to $3 billion from the global lender in a bid to escape its worst economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1948.
Sri Lankans have faced acute shortages of fuel and other basic goods for months, leaving it in political turmoil and inflation which is now soaring at almost 65pc.
The sources, who declined to be named ahead of an official announcement planned for Thursday, did not say how much money Sri Lanka might get but optimism around the news sent the country’s bonds to their highest level in two months.
The IMF said its team, that has been in the country for a week, had extended its stay by a day and that a news conference would be at the Sri Lankan central bank on Thursday.
“The IMF Mission in Colombo has been extended by one day because discussions are still ongoing with the authorities,” the IMF said in statement. Staff-level IMF agreements, as they are known, need to get formal approval of its management and executive board before recipient nations get any funding.

6,EU toughens travel rules for Russians,PRAGUE: European Union foreign ministers decided on Wednesday to make it more expensive and lengthier for Russians ...,"PRAGUE: European Union foreign ministers decided on Wednesday to make it more expensive and lengthier for Russians to obtain visas to travel to the bloc, but stopped short of agreeing to the EU-wide visa ban that Ukraine and several member states had called for. 
The EU was too divided to agree at this stage on a blanket ban, and also left unclear what unilateral measures Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Finland, which have land borders with Russia, could take to restrict access to Russian visitors. 
These five countries welcomed the suspension of Russia’s visa facilitation deal as a “necessary first step”, but stressed that more was needed to be done to “drastically” limit the numbers of visas issued and Russians travelling to the bloc since the invasion of Ukraine in February. 
“Until such measures are in place on the EU level, we ... will consider introducing on the national level temporary measures of visa ban, or restricting border crossing for Russian citizens holding EU visas, in order to address imminent public security issues,” they said in a joint statement. 
Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky said the EU’s executive commission would indeed look at ways to go further, including what can be done with what Lipavsky said were about 12 million Schengen visas already issued for Russians _ referring to the 26-country zone of open borders.

7,Gorbachev’s love-hate relationship with Putin,"At most, Gorbachev was an irritating thorn in Putin’s side.","MOSCOW: Mikhail Gorbachev, who died on Tuesday, struggled to make up his mind about Vladimir Putin.
Over the more than 20 years after Putin came to power, the ex-Soviet leader embraced, then rejected, then embraced again the man who — much like Gorbachev in the 1980s — came to embody Russia in the eyes of the West.
A grudging respect seemed to have developed in the end, with Gorbachev saying ahead of Putin’s 2018 re-election for a fourth term:  “Today he is a leader who deservedly enjoys people’s support.” After the chaos of the 1990s and the rule of his nemesis Boris Yeltsin, Gorbachev expressed hope for the former KGB agent who was first elected Russia’s president in 2000.
Putin, he said at the time, was  “intelligent, serious, reserved and well-organised. I like people of this kind.” For Gorbachev, Putin represented a chance for stability and economic growth, while continuing the transition to democracy he had set in place.
Even in 2006, as activists expressed increasing concern about the tough treatment of civil society under Putin, Gorbachev was able to declare that  “those who fear Putin’s authoritarian tendencies are wrong.” But as the years went by and hopes of democratic development in Russia evaporated, Gorbachev turned to veiled criticism and then to strongly worded attacks. Fraud-tainted 2011 parliamentary elections hardened his attitude against the president, as well as Putin’s decision to stand for an unprecedented third term in office. Gorbachev backed a protest movement that followed the elections and in 2013 made a stinging attack on Russia under Putin.
“Politics is more and more turning into an imitation of democracy. All power is in the hands of the authorities and the president,” Gorbachev said at the time.
“The economy is monopolised. Corruption has taken on colossal proportions.” Foreign media often latched on to his comments and he part-owned the proudly anti-Kremlin Novaya Gazeta newspaper, which suspended publication earlier this year after Russia launched its military action in Ukraine.
But at most Gorbachev was an irritating thorn in Putin’s side. The Kremlin shrugged off criticism from the man who allowed the collapse of the USSR, which Putin famously described as the biggest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century.
When Gorbachev slammed Putin over the decision to return to the Kremlin for a third term, the Russian strongman spat back by accusing the former Soviet president of  “abdicating” power.

8,"Flowers, photos as tributes paid to princess Diana, 25 years on","""The flowers here will wilt but mine will never die,"" one well-wisher says.","LONDON: Well-wishers left flowers and other tributes on Wednesday at princess Diana’s former London home and above the Paris road tunnel where she lost her life, to mark the 25th anniversary of her death.
The former Lady Diana Spencer, whose fairytale marriage to Prince Charles captivated the world until it publicly unravelled with revelations of infidelity and divorce, died in a car crash in the French capital on Aug 31, 1997. A trickle of well-wishers laid flowers, flags and photographs for the self-styled  “queen of people’s hearts” at the gates of Kensington Palace, and at the Place Diana, above the Pont de l’Alma tunnel.
At the Spencer family home, Althorp House, where Diana is buried in a lead-lined coffin on a secluded island on the estate, her brother Charles Spencer lowered the Union Jack to half mast. “She was a global celebrity,” retired camera operator Claue Gautier, 79, who came to pay his respects at the makeshift memorial in Paris, said.
“She was classy, sporty, elegant. Everyone’s sad today. My flowers for her are on the inside,” he said, touching the badge of his England football shirt.
“The flowers here will wilt but mine will never die.”
“We’re really missing someone like her today. If you look around the world, there’s no one like her,” added German tourist Ulrike Plank, 64, from Munich.
In London, well-wisher Julie Cein also said it was important to keep her positive memory and legacy alive. “She showed empathy, kindness, consideration to all people, regardless of their class in society,” she added.
