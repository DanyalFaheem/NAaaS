0,SC may take up PTI’s renewed challenge to NAB law today,Amended petition targets Aug 16 legislation on offences involving misappropriation of less than half a billion rupees.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court, o Thursday,  will resume the hearing of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan’s challenge to the recent amendments to National Accountability Bureau (NAB) ordinance, a day after an amended petition was filed in the matter on behalf of the ex-premier. 
A three-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, will take up the matter after Advocate Khawaja Haris Ahmed, counsel for the PTI chief, filed the amended petition that laid emphasis on the alleged violation of fundamental rights as a result of the legislation.
In the amended petition, the petitioner has included the challenge to second amendment to the law done by the coalition government on Aug 16 in which offences involving misappropriation of less than Rs500 million were taken out of the purview of the law. 
Moreover, absconders who were punished under Section 31 of the ordinance in absentia were also taken out.

Amended petition targets Aug 16 legislation on offences involving misappropriation of less than half a billion rupees

The petition stated that most of the changes were ‘person specific’. 
The petitioner pleaded that it would be just and fair in protecting the constitutional and fundamental rights of the citizens that NAB should be asked to provide details of all cases, which relate to prominent and influential holders of public office, especially regarding cases pertaining to offences of owning assets (movable and immovable) beyond known sources of income and misuse of authority.
However, the petitioner feared, the recent amendments operated to preemptively exonerate public office holders or their co-conspirators from offences of corruption. 
The petition claimed the amendments were also ultra vires of the fundamental rights guaranteed to people in articles 9, 14, 18, 24 and 25 of the Constitution. 
Senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan, who represented the federal government, has already furnished a concise statement in the case, which had been filed in June. 
According to the statement, the forum to enact or oppose the enactment of statutes was Parliament.
Politicians might succeed or fail in the Parliament in pursuit of their objectives and those frustrated in their endeavours could take their appeal to the people, the statement pointed out.
However, the remedy for grievances of such politicians was not with the courts of law, it added.

1,32 Balochistan districts declared ‘calamity-hit’,"Sherry warns of looming health crisis, says over $10bn needed to rebuild infrastructure resilient to climate change.","QUETTA / ISLAMABAD: The Baloc­histan government on Wednesday declared 32 out of the total 34 provincial districts “calamity-hit” as Climate Change Minister Sherry Rehman hinted that at least $10 billion would be required to rebuild climate resilient infrastructure to mitigate the impacts of global warming.
Since monstrous rains that started in June, at least 254 people have been killed in Balochistan and 1.3 million people have been forced to locate, the Balochistan chief minister’s adviser Mir Ziaullah Langove said in a press conference alongside Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Naseer Ahmed Nasar.
The officials said at least 10 districts -- Quetta, Nasirabad, Jaffarabad, Sohbatpur, Jhal Magsi, Bolan (Kachhi) Khuzdar, Lasbela, Qila Saifullah and Qila Abdullah -- were particularly hit hard by the unprecedented floods that levelled crops and destroyed thousands of houses.
Mr Langove said so far 29,000 people were rescued and added that 185,000 houses were partially damaged while 64,000 houses were completely washed away in the floods. He said that 500,000 livestock were killed during floods as well.

He said that the government and NGOs have provided 98,000 people rations for one month whereas 40,000 tents were provided to the flood-stricken families. 
He added that 150,000 tents were needed at least.
Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz informed that the government has given compensation of Rs2 million each to the heirs of 170 people who lost their lives in flood-related incidents while the cases of remaining victims would finalise in the next few days.
He said that NHA was working to restore national highways and in the next three to four days these roads would be opened for traffic. The railways bridge could take several weeks to become operational though.
The five districts of Nasirabad division were still submerged, according to the officials of the Irrigation department who termed these regions ‘green belt’ of Balochistan. Meanwhile, hundreds of families in the villages of the said division remained stranded as these areas had become inaccessible after washing away of roads. The authorities however have managed to provide them with food and water through helicopter sorties.
Quetta and seven other districts were still without gas and power supply. The SSGC engineers started replacing damaged gas pipelines on Tuesday and work had reached near completion on the 12-inch diametre pipeline but the main pipeline, 24-inch diametre, needed at least two more days to be repaired.
The power supply was also not fully restored and at least two-third of Balochistan was without power by the time this report was made.
‘Need $10bn to rebuild better’
In Islamabad, Senator Sherry warned of a health crisis in the post-flood scenario, saying the flood-hit regions will be exposed to water-borne diseases.
Speaking at a press conference alongside Commerce Minister Syed Naveed Qamar and Senator Shahadat Awan, she said 72 districts out of the total 160 districts were submerged and had been declared calamity-hit areas. In total, she said 110 districts were affected by the floods making it half of the country.

Calling it a moment of extreme fragility for the country, Sherry Rehman said at least 33 million affected population was in dire need of potable water, cooked food, and basic medical care.
“We are under-resourced at the moment, but we implore everyone to donate as much as possible to reliable organisations. We have repurposed our funds to service the relief effort, including the BISP cash transfers, to deal with the immediate calamity. It is still not enough. All of us must stand united in the face of this devastation,” she said.
Speaking about rehabilitation, the senator said, “The task of rebuilding in places has already begun, but it will be a mammoth task. If we are to build back better, it will require more than the $10 billion that is being talked about.”
The minister said climate resilient infrastructure was expensive and required scientific designs with fortifications to withstand climate shocks. “The same will be the case for [climate-resilient] crops, she said, adding that at present all of Sindh’s crop was nearly wiped out.

2,"Rs240m spent on Imran’s security annually, says Islamabad police chief","2 private security companies, 266 personnel from police, FC and Rangers have been deployed for ex-PM's security, he says.","ISLAMABAD: Isla­mabad Inspector General of Police Dr Akbar Nasir Khan has revealed that the government was spending Rs240 million annually on the security of former prime minister and PTI chairman Imran Khan.
The information came to light in a meeting of the Senate Standing Com­mittee on Interior, held on Wednesday, which was chaired by PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz.
During the proceedings, IG Nasir was asked about the reasons for withdrawal of Mr Khan’s security and revoking of private security companies’ licences that were deployed for his protection.
IG Nasir told the committee that besides the two private security companies, 266 personnel from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Islamabad, Gilgit-Baltistan police, Frontier Consta­bulary and Rangers have been deployed for Mr Khan’s security.
The committee was told that licences were revoked by the interior ministry, however, they are still performing security duties.
Like former premiers Raja Pervaiz Asharf, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Yousuf Raza Gillani, Mr Khan was also provided with five security guards, IGP Nasir said.
Mr Aziz said that the former prime minister was a ‘global leader’ who has spoken about Islamophobia numerous times. 
Expressing concerns over the decision, Mr Aziz said that security  agencies and the police themselves have confirmed the threats and in  this situation, the orders to withdraw Mr Khan’s security was ‘unlawful  and inappropriate’.
“These steps of Imran Khan are… not liked by the West,” Mr Aziz added.
Senator Dr Shehzad Waseem, who also belonged to PTI, remarked that the withdrawal of Mr Khan’s security was worrisome.

3,Govt to send Tarin-Jhagra tape for forensic audit,Law minister says tape indicates KP finance minister ‘violated oath of office’...,"KARACHI: Federal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Wednesday said the government has decided to send the audio tape of a conversation between former finance minister Shaukat Tarin and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Finance Minister Taimur Khan Jhagra for a forensic audit.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, Mr Tarar revealed that the ministries of law and interior consulted over the matter and the decision to take any action would be made after the forensic report was compiled.
“Every parliamentarian takes the oath to uphold national interest,” he said, adding that federal and provincial ministers take an additional oath to discharge their duties per the law.
However, the conversation between Mr Tarin and Mr Jhagra indicated that the latter violated his oath (as a provincial minister) while the former has put politics over the State.
“I think this is not only a violation of national interest but also treason,” he added.

Law minister says tape indicates KP finance minister ‘violated oath of office’

Commenting on the contempt proceedings against former prime minister Imran Khan in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the minister expressed hope that the case will be decided as per the precedents set in past cases of similar nature, involving lawmakers from other parties and even prime ministers.
Referring to a Supreme Court decision in 2015, Mr Tarar said a bench headed by then chief justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali heard a contempt case against Mr Khan after he had called the judiciary’s role during the 2013 election shameful.
In the case, Mr Khan was let go with a warning and he had given an undertaking that he would never use such remarks for the judiciary again, Mr Tarar added.
He also took a jibe at the reply submitted by Mr Khan in the IHC, and said that if a former prime minister cannot differentiate between a sessions judge and an executive magistrate, “he should evaluate whether he is capable to rule the country”.
In his reply to the IHC on Tuesday, Mr Khan had explained that he was under a misconception that Additional District and Sessions Judge Zeba Chaudhry (whom he ‘intimidated’ during a public speech) was an executive magistrate carrying out executive or administrative functions on the federal government’s orders.
The law minister also said that the cabinet committee formed in June to probe the return of Rs50 billion by British authorities to the previous government was pursuing the matter and reply from the UK’s National Crime Agency was awaited for further action.
In the clips that surfaced on Monday, Mr Tarin can be heard telling Mr Jhagra and Punjab Finance Minister Mohsin Leghari and to tell the federal government that provinces could not post a budget surplus — an IMF demand — in the light of devastating floods.
In one recording, Mr Leghari had asked Mr Tarin whether such a letter would hurt the interests of the state. Mr Tarin purportedly replied: “They (PML-N) continue blackmailing us in the name of the State and we keep on helping them. This cannot happen.”

ADB sends money
The $3m grant approved by the ADB is financed from theAsia Pacific Disaster Response Fund (APDRF) and it will help the government procure food supplies, tents, and other relief goods.
“ADB stands with the people of Pakistan during these difficult times,” said Director General for Central and West Asia Yevgeniy Zhukov. “We are committed to working with the government and other development partners to help Pakistan overcome the devastating impact of this natural disaster and provide immediate relief to affected families.”
Meanwhile, the Islamic Devel­opment Bank said it was ready to support the government in its efforts to address the negative impact of the floods.
Similarly, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) said that IFAD was ready to immediately adjust its activities in Pakistan to respond to the urgent needs of families affected by the floods.  “We will also continue our long-standing work with local rural communities, building livelihoods, food security, and resilience to climate shocks,” said IFAD Country Director Hubert Boirard.
“While we are on the ground trying to find out more, damaged infrastructure and difficulties accessing affected areas are hampering efforts, particularly in Balochistan,” the statement added.
The World Meteorological Organ­isation (WMO) highlighted the importance of WMO’s drive to ensure universal access to early warnings which drive ‘Anticipatory Action’ through the UN Alerts for all initiatives and its integrated flood management and flash flood warning tools.
Furthermore, the Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the government has a human rights obligation to prevent foreseeable harm from climate change and extreme weather events.

He was referring to a probable apology from PTI chairman Imran Khan in the Islamabad High Court which is hearing a contempt of court case against him.
He said Pakistan’s democracy has never been challenged the way it has been challenged today, “even in worst times custodial torture was condemned”.

7,SC stresses need to do away with gender bias in all spheres,IHC decision in PTV harassment case overturned; court orders recovery of compensation from respondent.,"ISLAMABAD: While setting aside the Islamabad High Court’s decision in a case pertaining to women’s harassment at the workplace, the Supreme Court on Wednesday highlighted the need to bid farewell to gender biases and encourage women’s participation in all spheres of life with ‘honour and dignity’.
“The dignity is an inherent and inseparable right of a human being and has thus been guaranteed by Const­itution as an absolute, non-negotiable and inviolable fundamental right and not subject to any qualification, restriction or regulation,” stated the judgement that Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah wrote.
Justice Shah was a member of a two-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, that had taken up an appeal against the Feb 8, 2019 decision of the IHC.
The case at hand involves June 15, 2016 complaint by Uzma Naveed Chaudhry and four other female anchorpersons of state-run Pakistan Television (PTV) against Ather Farook Buttar, the controller in charge of PTV News Centre, Islamabad. 

High court decision in PTV harassment case overturned; court orders recovery of compensation from respondent

In their filed before the federal ombudsman under the Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2010, the complainant alleged the senior official had been harassing them individually at their workplace for a long time. The alleged sexual advances made to the petitioners included comments such as “she is looking hot” and offering her to book a hotel room, winking at her and making indecent gestures, sending a phone message expressing his love for her, visiting her at her house uninvited, asking her out for dinner and upon her refusal threatening her to suffer the consequences, promising to make her a star if she would have friendship with him, and attempting physical assault on her in his office.”
The petitioners and the respondent filed representations to the President of Pakistan against the decision of the federal ombudsman, with the former asking for enhancement of the punishment and the latter seeking exoneration from the allegations.
While accepting the representation of the petitioners on Dec 30, 2016, the then president late Mamnoon Hussain converted the punishment of the respondent into major penalty of removal from service instead of the minor penalties imposed by the federal ombudsman.
However, the respondent challenged the president’s order before the IHC that partially accepted the plea and maintained the decision of the federal ombudsman. The IHC order was then challenged before the apex court.
In the SC order, Justice Shah observed no nation could rise to the height of glory, in the words of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, unless women were side by side with men. “We are victims of evil customs. It is a crime against humanity that our women are shut up within the four walls of the houses as prisoners. There is no sanction anywhere for the deplorable condition in which our women have to live,” he noted in the judgement.
Setting aside the IHC order, the SC ordered that compensation from arrears of pay, pension emoluments or any other source (property) of the respondent be recovered. 
Safe working environment
Right to a safe working environment for all genders, male, female and transgender, free of harassment, abuse and intimidation draws its real strength from the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution, the verdict noted.
Any act of harassment done by any person that affects the free choice to enter and continue any lawful profession or occupation would amount to threatening the safety of the working environment, the SC ruled.

8,Maryam laments ‘double standard’ of justice system,"""Relaxation and facilities provided to Imran” have once again exposed “injustices and excesses” against PML-N, she says.","LAHORE: The Islamabad High Court’s (IHC) decision on Wednesday to give PTI chief Imran Khan another week to file his reply in the contempt of court case brought against him for criticising a sessions judge didn’t go down well with the PML-N, whose leadership accused the judiciary of having a “double standard”. 
In a Twitter post, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz said “the relaxation and facilities provided to Imran Khan” had once again exposed “the injustices and excesses” against the party and its supremo Nawaz Sharif, who was disqualified in 2017 by the Supreme Court from holding public office for life. 
“The scales [of justice] could not be balanced,” she said. 

 





 
The allegations against the PTI chairman stem from a speech he made, criticising the judge Zeba Chaudhry, for giving his chief of staff, Shahbaz Gill, in police custody in a sedition case. 
“In fact, the punishment for contempt should be given to judge Zeba sahiba, who insulted the honour of Imran Khan by upholding justice,” Maryam Nawaz said in another tweet, which she retweeted using the hashtag “dual standards of justice rejected”. 

 





 
Another PML-N leader, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, also criticised the judiciary, regretting that courts didn’t take a lenient view in the cases of PML-N leaders Daniyal Aziz, Talal Chaudhry and Nehal Hashmi. 
“Previous court decisions are making a mockery of justice,” she tweeted. “If today’s decision [of the IHC] is right, those [previous] decisions should also be corrected, and if they were correct, justice should be seen in this decision as well.” 
Referring to Nawaz Sharif, she said a three-time prime minister was disqualified for life for not taking a salary from his son, removed as party head and sent to jail with his daughter. 
“If popularity is the measure of justice, where was this yardstick in the case of [former] prime minister Nawaz Sharif?” she wondered. 

 





 
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal also retweeted a post of senior journalist and former Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Najam Sethi, stating: “Can any legal eagle quote a precedent where a court asked an alleged contemnor to ‘revise’ his response to the charge instead of proceeding on its basis? Is the IHC telling Imran to offer ‘some sort’ of apology in writing so that it can let him off the hook?”

9,State Bank receives  $1.16bn from IMF,"Funds will help improve foreign exchange reserves, facilitate realisation of inflows from other sources, says SBP.","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan on Wednesday received $1.16 billion deposit from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), two days after the much-needed nod of the Fund to immediate disbursement on successful completion of the combined seventh and eighth reviews of a loan facility. 
In a late-night tweet, the SBP confirmed the development and expressed the confidence that it would help improve foreign exchange reserves.
“Today, #SBP has received proceeds of USD 1.16 billion (equivalent of SDR 894 million) after the IMF Executive Board completed the combined seventh and Eight review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan.
“This will help improve SBP’s foreign exchange reserves and will also facilitate realization of other planned inflows from multilateral and bilateral sources,” the SBP said on Twitter.

 





 
Under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement — signed in July 2019 — the IMF was to provide $6bn to Pakistan during a 39-month period. The IMF executive board on August 29 approved an extension of the programme until end of June 2023 after a series of negotiations that had been under way for several months.
An official IMF announcement on Monday stated its executive board completed the combined seventh and eighth reviews of the loan facility for Pakistan, allowing immediate disbursement of $1.1 billion to the country. The statement pointed out that the disbursement “brings total purchases (money made available) for budget support under this arrangement to about $3.9 billion.”
The board noted that authorities in Pakistan have taken important measures to address the country’s worsened fiscal and external positions resulting from accommodative policies in FY22 and spillovers from the war in Ukraine. These two factors “have placed significant pressure on the rupee and foreign reserves,” the statement added.

10,Bags of wasted flour ‘not dropped by armed forces’,"Videos emerge of areas where flour bags, dropped by helicopters, seem to burst upon impact, scattering their contents to wind.","KARACHI: As relief efforts to get much-needed supplies to flood victims continue across the country, videos have emerged of areas where flour bags, dropped by helicopters, seem to have burst upon impact, scattering their contents to the wind.
Videos shared by several social media users showed a crowd of flood victims — including men and young boys — rushing towards the site of an aid drop. The downforce generated by the helicopter’s rotors creates a strong wind, and a white powder is seen swirling in the air. 
As the video continues, it becomes clear that the white powder is flour which has spilled out of aid bags that were dropped. Most of the flood-hit people can be seen trying to secure whatever flour is left in the bags, while others try to scrape it off the ground, mixing it with dirt and loose pebbles.
However, according to an armed forces official who has been involved in aerial operations, the team performing the ration drop could not have been one of theirs.
“We cannot throw food items and ration packs willy-nilly, because it is a responsibility that we are carrying out, not throwing something into a dustbin. It would be a complete waste of fuel and effort if we carried out the distribution of relief goods from the air like that,” the official said.
Sharing the SOPs invol­ved in dropping goods by air, the official revealed that the pilot’s first priority is to try and find a suitable place to land. 
“If the surface is uneven and there is no way to land without risk, then they drop the packages, and those too from no more than 10 feet, in order to ensure the safe landing of the packages without damage.”
The official claimed that the footage was either doctored, or it was an operation by a private orgianisation.
According to the official, there were instances where the Pakistan Army, Air Force and Navy helicopters involved in relief work could not find even ground to touch down and only touched two of their three wheels to rescue and evacuate people by pulling them up. “They will never deliberately waste food items or ration goods such as rice or flour like is being shown,” the official said.
Another discrepancy the official referred to was the fact that the armed forces were no longer dropping uncooked food. “We are now dropping cooked food items because with water all around them, the flood-hit people are unable to cook themselves.”
