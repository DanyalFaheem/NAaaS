1,Severe crisis lies ahead as Sindh health facilities incapacitated by floods,Officials say rebuilding of damaged hospitals may take considerable time.,"KARACHI: While describing the situation in flood-hit areas of Sindh as ‘extremely critical’, health authorities say that serious damages have been occurred to key healthcare installations and estimate that more than 1,000 health facilities so far across the province have been damaged by the floods. 
The situation poses a serious challenge for the government as it becomes very difficult to offer any service to flood victims, who are at risk of multiple diseases, like waterborne infections, diarrhoea, cholera, typhoid and skin diseases. 
The authorities also believe that at this stage it is premature to estimate how long it could take to rebuild these healthcare facilities and infrastructure. 
The fresh estimates emerge in the latest report prepared by the Sindh health department which shows that the floods have ruined some 122 government hospitals, dispensaries and health units which were offering treatments at different levels across the province. 

Officials say rebuilding of damaged hospitals may take considerable time

“The level of damage is so high that it forced the health authorities to abandon certain facilities and move to alternative places as makeshift arrangements,” the officials said. 
“Apart from 122 completely damaged health facilities, there are 950 government hospitals, dispensaries or health units which have also been hit by floods and most of them are no more able to offer any services,” said an official citing the report. 
“Among these facilities, Mirpurkhas is among the worst-hit which has completely lost 65 facilities and 171 partially followed by Sukkur where 14 health facilities have completely been damaged. The other key regions of the province include Hyderabad with 22 facilities, Larkana 13 and Shaheed Benazirabad with seven.”
Dr Muhammad Juman Bahoto, director general (DG) of health services, agreed that the flood had made the health service delivery challenging at the time when it’s most needed. 
He said that the provincial government in an immediate move was trying to acquire space to move the health facilities as makeshift arrangement. 
“The assessment is still going on,” he said. 
“The structures which have been damaged include all kinds of health facilities and in some cases even fully-fledged general hospitals, which are badly hit by floodwater and no more able to offer any service. However, the donor agencies are now cooperating with us and we are making emergency arrangements to operationalise the maximum number of health facilities in different districts.”
He said the province had borne major damage in 22 districts and in those areas the health systems were badly affected. At the same time alternative arrangements were being made to cope with the emerging situation, he added. 
The other assessments issued by the Sindh health ministry in its reports suggest that Naushahro Feroze has emerged as the worst-affected area where more than 725,000 people are displaced who have already left their homes due to floods. 
Larkana follows next where around 442,993 people are displaced, which is more than 36 per cent of the total population of the district. 
Amid displacement of such a large number of people and almost non-existent healthcare system, the fear of spread of waterborne diseases and other infections rears its head. 
The concerns recently reverberated in an assessment report federal health ministry prepared warns that up to five million people across the country are at risk of different diseases after their displacement from homes and now living in tents.

2,Two labourers  fall to their death after construction lift buckles,KARACHI: Two labourers died after a fall from the 12th floor of an under-construction building on Sharea Faisal as...,"KARACHI: Two labourers died after a fall from the 12th floor of an under-construction building on Sharea Faisal as the makeshift construction lift buckled on Wednesday, police and rescuers said.
Ferozabad SHO Meraj Anwar said that the construction work was going on at the 12th floor of the building near Lal Kothi.
He said the labourers were carrying goods in amotorised platform used to reach high elevations when it developed some fault and buckled apparently because of its weak structure. As a result, the two labourers fell and hit the ground. They died on the spot. 
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson identified the deceased as Jamal Khan, 55, and Yusuf Mohammed, 25. 
The SHO said the bodies of the victims, who originally hail from Shangla, were taken away by their relatives for burial in their hometown. 
They informed the police that they would lodge an FIR after funeral.
The officer said the contractor/owner of the building had closed down his office and escape. He said his whereabouts were not known. 
He said that if the victims’ heirs approached, the police would invoke charges of negligence and manslaughter against the builder(s).
Meanwhile, a man was found murdered in Ittehad Town on Wednesday.
Police said that the body of Asif Mohammed, 42, was found close to a factory at Khyber Chowk. The police said he was strangled. The body also bore marks of torture. 
The victim was a motor mechanic. 
Man shot dead in Korangi
An elderly man was shot dead in Korangi on Wednesday, police said.
Area SHO Farooq Sanjrani said apparently a lone armed man entered a furniture shop and killed its owner, Farman Irfan, 55.
He said the victim had set up the furniture shop on the second floor of a residential building. In the morning, he was reading a newspaper when the assailant shot him in the head from a close range and fled. He died on the spot.
The SHO suspected some property dispute between the family members as a probable motive for the murder.

3,SHC sets aside death sentence of man in Karachi girl’s rape case,Lower court sentenced the man to death in Jan 2021 for raping 11-year-old girl at his house in Manghopir in Feb 2018.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has set aside the death sentence handed down to a man in a case pertaining to the rape of an 11-year-old girl.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha observed that the evidence of the victim was doubtful and the DNA report did not link the appellant with rape.
The SHC further said that it was a very heinous offence as a minor girl had been assaulted, but as judges they had to put such aspects aside and decide the matter by dispassionately assessing the evidence on record.
An additional district and sessions court had sentenced the man to death in January last year for raping the 11-year-old girl at his house in Manghopir in February 2018.
The convict through his lawyer challenged the trial court order before the SHC and after hearing both sides and examining the record and proceedings of the case, the bench allowed the appeal and exonerated the appellant by overturning the capital punishment.
The bench in its judgement said that the case was registered by the victim’s father after a delay of eight days and although he attempted to explain it, no witness was produced to corroborate his version.
It noted that if the evidence of the victim was found to be reliable and trustworthy about the place of incident and who had assaulted her, the court could convict on the basis of her evidence coupled with medical evidence alone even without matching the DNA, but her testimony was found doubtful on such points.
The order further stated that as per the evidence of the girl, at the time of incident she and her sister were studying together with the daughter of the appellant at his house.
It further said the victim in her testimony before the trial court further deposed that the study was completed around midnight at the courtyard of the house and the victim’s mother and appellant’s wife had tea. She said while his daughter and victim’s sister were cleaning the courtyard and kitchen, the appellant dragged her in a dark place and attempted to rape her and in the meanwhile her sister and daughter of the appellant came and saved her.
The court order said that the victim was raped according to the medical report, but the chemical and DNA samples were sent after a delay of three days without any explanation and there was no evidence of safe custody during this period.
The women medico-legal officer, who examined the victim and found her sexually assaulted, in her evidence said: “As per history of the girl, some unknown person entered her home and assaulted her,” it said and added that the MLO had no enmity or ill-will to give false evidence against the victim.
The bench further noted that as per the evidence of the victim, her sister was also a key witness, but she was not called at the trial court to give her statement without any explanation.
It said that at time of the incident, there were 10 to 12 persons present in the two-room house with a courtyard, and it did not appeal to logic that appellant would attempt to rape her in the presence of so many people.
The bench observed that the victim had a motive to falsely implicate the appellant at the behest of her father as the appellant in his statement before the trial court said that there was a property dispute between him and the complainant, but this aspect was not investigated by the police.
“For the reasons discussed above we find doubt in the prosecution case and by extending the benefit of the doubt to the appellant he is acquitted of the charge, the impugned judgment is set aside, his appeal is allowed and the appellant shall be released unless wanted in any other custody case,” the verdict concluded.

5,"15 years on, officials responsible for Shershah bridge collapse in Karachi evade justice","FIA makes no arrest despite lodging FIR in April against ex-NHA head, four others.","KARACHI: Despite passing 15 years to the collapse of a major portion of the Shershah bridge, multiple probes initiated by the police, communication ministry as well as the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) have failed to yield any positive result and provide justice to the families of six persons who were killed in the incident on Sept 1, 2007.
While a manslaughter case was  registered on April 7, 2010 on the directives of  the Supreme Court in which the accused were acquitted by a sessions court in 2012, another FIR was lodged by the FIA in April this year against a former chairman of the National Highway Authority (NHA), a director of a textile mill and three others pertaining to the collapse of Shershah Bridge.However, despite registration of the FIR, the FIA Agency has so far failed to take action against any of the nominated suspects.
Sources linked the registration of the case and then the stalled investigations with the political developments in the country that saw the change of the government and leadership at various law enforcement agencies.
A senior FIA official, who is familiar with the case, told Dawn that the nominated suspects had neither joined investigations nor approached any court for bail before arrest.  

FIA makes no arrest despite lodging FIR in April against ex-NHA head, four others

Official papers reviewed by Dawn suggested that an FIR (15/2022) in connection with the 15-year-old incident was lodged against ex-chairman of NHA retired Major General Farrukh Javed, ex-member NHA Raja Nousherwan, ex-project director of the Karachi Northern Bypass Flyover Yousaf Barakzai, Khalid Mirza of ECIL and Naveed Mirza of the Paracha Textile Mill on the complaint of the then chairman of the Prime Minister’s Inspection Commission.
The sources said the case was registered in Karachi but top FIA authorities had transferred the investigation to agency’s Islamabad office on April 29.
The official papers stated the suspects, said to be extremely influential, allegedly allowed construction of the faulty flyover despite timely warning by the experts concerned that the bridge must be demolished and redesigned correctly as inherent faults could not be solved through remedial measures.
The FIA said that ‘faulty design’ of the bridge was made to protect land of the textile mills.
The official papers revealed that the said suspects having “criminal intentions and common objective by means of fraud knowingly/deliberately” soon after realising the inherent fault in the design of KNBP wilfully constructed the defected flyover on the small piece of land of Paracha Textile Mill for its protection.
The FIA mentioned that M/s ECIL Pvt Ltd got prepared a ‘faulty’ design and NHA insisted on construction of the bridge on a small piece of land although more land was required for construction of safe bridge. “Due to faulty design, ill-conceived structure and criminal negligence of the said accused persons, the bridge collapsed.”
The FIA came to the conclusion that the accused persons committed criminal negligence and caused wrongful monetary losses of over Rs427 million to the NHA and corresponding wrongful gain to ECIL and Paracha Textile Mill and their act constituted the commission of offences under section 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant), 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1947.
Chronology of the events showed that the bridge was formally inaugurated by then president Gen Pervez Musharraf on Aug 6, 2007, which collapsed within a month i.e. on Sept 1, 2007.
The Supreme Court had taken suo motu notice of the incident in 2010, and directed the Sindh police to register an FIR and also take action against officials responsible for not registering the case immediately at time when the incident took place.
Subsequently, the SITE-B police registered the case on the order of the apex court after a lapse of two years and seven months in April 2010. A final charge sheet was submitted and charges were framed against the accused in the same year. 
However, a supplementary charge sheet was submitted by the then DIG-Investigation Iftikhar Husain Tarrar, which placed all the accused in the Column-2 of the charge sheet with blue ink, not sending them for trial. Thus, the accused were acquitted by a court in 2012.
However, in 2015, a three-member SC bench took up this matter on an appeal and noted with deep regret that “despite lapse of almost seven years from the date of collapse of the bridge and almost four years from the date of interim order of this court, nothing has been brought on record to show any legal process that was initiated per direction of this court culminated into its logical conclusion”.
As the apex court did not absolve any of the private respondents or any other person charged with professional incompetence, criminal neglect and or breach of public duty, then chairman PM Inspection Commission Islamabad retired Lt Col Saifuddin Qureshi submitted a complaint before the FIA on June 10, 2016 to initiate an inquiry into the Shershah bridge collapse.
The Corporate Crime Circle of the FIA-Karachi registered the FIR against five persons on April 12, 2022 after conducting a thorough inquiry into the incident.
However, the investigation of the case was transferred from Karachi to Islamabad on April 29.
NED professors’ inquiry
A team of senior professors of the NED University of Engineering and Technology along with other experts had conducted an inquiry on the orders of the then prime minister. The then chairman of Department of Civil Engineering and current Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Sarosh Hashmat Lodi told FIA investigators that they had come to the conclusion that ‘the reason of the physical collapse was indeed an implementation of ill-conceived structural system and design thereof. However, notwithstanding the physical collapse due to faulty structure design, the criminal neglect on the part of NHA in discharging its duties fiducially shall, however, remain the root cause of collapse of the Paracha Chowk Box Girder Bridge, as the NHA ignominiously failed to ensure implementation of the project’, according to the official papers.
No third party opinion sought when defects became apparent
The FIA said the construction of the Shershah bridge started in year 2003 and ‘abnormal behaviour/defects of the bridge’ were observed in year 2006 and the work on the bridge was stopped.
ECIL designing firm visited the site along with company director Khalid Mirza. Subsequently, NHA Islamabad GM Design Asim Amin, and Iqbal-ul-Haq, a hired consultant of the NHA, visited the site as well.
They met with Ms Majida, the design engineer of ECIL, who informed them that the ‘record pertaining to design calculation has been misplaced and not available with them’.
The NHA consultant suggested to ECIL that ‘remedial measures will not likely solve the problem’.
The expert proposed to demolish and redesign the bridge correctly as ‘repairing and rehabilitation measures will waste good money’.
However, despite these warnings and suggestions, the then NHA Chairman, Maj Gen Farrukh Javed chaired a meeting in Karachi on Oct 26, 2006, which was attended by ‘all stakeholders’ and ordered National Logisitics Cell to immediately start ‘the rehabilitation work’ at Shershah Bridge. The FIA papers said that during this meeting, Mr Amin suggested to avail the expertise of Brig Dr Jamil who was serving Engineer-in-Chief Branch GHQ.
The FIA said that the accused Mr Nousherwan instead of approving the note/proposal, wrote ‘NFA’ (No Further Action) on the note sheet.
The FIA in its inquiry regretted that ‘unfortunately no third party opinion was sought and ultimately segment of Shershah Bridge collapsed’.

6,Poor planning of land use blamed for significant damages caused by floods,Stakeholders urged to work together for national flood policy...,"KARACHI: While appealing for contribution towards rescue, relief and rehabilitation efforts currently under way in Pakistan, the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-P) has called upon all relevant stakeholders, including federal, provincial and local governments and disaster management agencies, to work together on a robust national flood policy that focuses on adaptation.
“As one of the countries most threatened by extreme weather, Pakistan’s current crisis is a calamity in itself, but also a warning about what the future holds,” Hammad Naqi Khan, the director general of the WWF-P, stated.
Monsoons, he said, were essential for irrigating crops and replenishing groundwater and water reservoirs. This year, with precipitation as high as 600 per cent over the average; many parts of the country had been submerged.
“The occurrence, frequency, and scale of the rains are clearly linked with climate change; the impacts of which will be felt long after this water drains.”

Stakeholders urged to work together for national flood policy

According to WWF-P experts, a significant amount of damage in floods has occurred due to poor land use planning and disregard for the environmental systems.
“While flooding is one of the most damaging natural disasters, losses primarily emanate from poor flood risk management. After the catastrophic floods of 2010, we had over 10 years to prepare ourselves. However, our responses continue to be reactive,” said Mr Khan.
He emphasized that all relevant stakeholders, including federal, provincial and local governments, disaster management agencies, non-profit and non-government entities must work together on a robust national flood policy that focuses on adaptation.
Dr Masood Arshad, Senior Director Footprint at WWF-P, explained that though climate change had driven this tragedy; with changing monsoon patterns and extremely high localised rainfall; a significant amount of damage had been due to poor land use planning and disregard for the environmental systems that drive our economies. This included encroachment on river beds and construction on floodplains.
“Our response to the challenge must be multifaceted. To be in a position where we can appropriately address flood risks, we must begin by limiting development in flood prone areas and improve our forecasting and evacuating systems,” he said.
The experts called for formulating a strategy that takes into consideration the environment and addresses the challenges of widespread rains and floods of high magnitude.

The briefing was organised by the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (Pima) Karachi chapter.
Sharing his concerns over the devastating floods affecting over 100 districts in the country, Dr Abdullah Muttaqi heading Pima-Karachi said diseases, such as cholera, diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, typhoid, dengue and malaria were spreading fast in the flood-hit areas due to standing water, unhygienic conditions and polluted water.
“These diseases can also lead to increased mortality in affected areas. The number of snake-bite patients is also expected to rise. Skin diseases such as scabies and fungal infections are also common due to a lack of sanitation,” he explained.
According to him, there were still many flood-affected areas that couldn’t receive government attention. 
“The government should establish a panel of medical experts to formulate a national policy to prevent epidemics. It should utilise its resources to establish field hospitals with essential treatment and prevention facilities for common diseases.”
Medical emergency
The speakers also shared the plight of pregnant women, infants and the elderly, who had been badly affected by the tragedy. Patients with chronic illnesses, they said, would likely experience interruption in their ongoing treatment.
“Our rural population, especially women and children, who have been suffering from malnutrition and anaemia for a long time, is vulnerable to disease more than ever. The situation warrants immediate steps and the government should declare a medical emergency,” said Dr Sohail Akhtar, warning that the humanitarian crisis could turn into a bigger challenge.
Replying to a question, he said the nationwide disaster demanded that the government, which had the system and infrastructure, to design a strategy and maximise its efforts by effectively engaging non-governmental organisations.
“The government should set up control centres in every district, through which information could be exchanged between various non-governmental organisations to avoid wastage of resources,” he said.
Earlier, speakers briefed journalists about the association’s relief efforts in the disaster-hit areas and said that the association was active in South Punjab, Balochistan, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it had set up medical camps and mobile units.
Pima’s relief work in charge Dr Rao Muhammad Naeem shared: “So far, 70 centres have been set up at 30 locations where around 150 doctors and paramedics are providing services. Free treatment and medicines have been provided to more than 15,000 patients at these camps.”

9,Experts’ advice stressed before depicting persons with mental illnesses on TV,KARACHI: “Do Pakistani TV dramas get it right when it comes to mental health?” The answer to this pertinent...,"KARACHI: “Do Pakistani TV dramas get it right when it comes to mental health?” The answer to this pertinent question started a vibrant online discussion on Wednesday organised by Uks Research, Resource and Publication Centre on Women and Media through its initiative ‘Hopscotch’ that examines television drama content and its effects on viewers.  
The discussion kicked off with a thought-provoking presentation looking at mental health and stigma. Are Pakistani dramas further stigmatising mental health or are they raising awareness?  
It was pointed out that exaggerated, inaccurate and comical characters are often used to portray persons with psychiatric disorders in our plays. Persons with mental illness are also depicted as violent, murderous, unpredictable and they have themselves to blame for their condition.  
Looking at the entertainment media’s depiction of suicide it was felt that there is an over-generalisation of mental illness whereas our plays should be used as a tool to sensitise a mass audience, create a safe place to talk about mental health, change negative attitudes and reduce the stigma of mental health.  
Writer Bee Gul said that this might be because those involved in writing or producing plays were not equipped to understand mental illness and to be better equipped they needed to do research by speaking to the experts with first-hand knowledge of such things.  
“There is a certain responsibility on their shoulders to provide the true picture and also spread awareness instead of thinking about ratings or creating sensation,” she said.  
“They should think more about developing a dialogue, a narrative but many a time, sadly, they give in for the sake of ratings,” she added.  
Television actor and director Saife Hasan said that media houses producing entertainment were doing business. They plays that they produce, the stories they tell are all for getting commercials and making good money. “So I doubt if they can be changed. So those who can do something about this would be the writers. They will have to bring about change on the subject of mental health,” he said while suggesting that perhaps NGOs involved in media monitoring and training could gather the writers and spread awareness regarding the depiction of mental health with them.  
The Uks director said that instead of opening our minds there are things shown in our dramas, which disturb us and they must do something about it. “Uks has for the last 25 years been training journalists by sensitising them to issues,” she said, adding that still the problem won’t just go away by training or sensitising the playwrights.  
“What about directors? What do the channels want? Uks and Hopscotch’s work here is just a small drop in the ocean. But we are looking for a positive way out,” she concluded.

“We have to rehabilitate people, give them jobs, reconstruct road network and strengthen economy,” said Bhutto-Zardari, adding that they would also need machinery to restore fertility of inundated farmland after the floodwaters receded.
Bhutto-Zardari, who was received by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Federal Minister for Water Resources Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah at Sukkur airport on Wednesday, was speaking to the guests at a meeting he chaired at the airport to inform them about the scale of devastation caused by the torrential rains and flood in Sindh and other provinces.
He said that the torrential rain and flood had affected almost entire country but it had rained more than usual in Sindh. At present, drainage system was not working due to high flood at Guddu and Sukkur barrages, he said.
He said: “This is the first flood which has inundated both riverian areas and the urban centres at the same time, rendering large populations homeless. The rain and flood had destroyed crops and caused loss of Rs33.5,441 million to growers in the province, he said.
The National Disaster Manager Authority (NDMA) officers also briefed the delegation about the damage from the catastrophe.

Speaking at a press conference at the local press club here on Wednesday, he said Balochistan was hit mainly due to its backwardness. 
He said that 270 people had died in the recent rains and flooding while 204,000 cattle perished. Quoting government figures, he said crops on 210,000 acres had been destroyed while hill torrents coupled with heavy rainfall had spelt disaster for the province.
He said the dams built by the Britishers in the province were still intact, but those constructed after 90s had been destroyed. Protective dykes had also been washed away, he said, calling for holding an inquiry into those damages to the dams. 
He said the Balochistan chief minister did not visit his own constituency while the Balochistan’s spokesperson represented the province while sitting at “Lakshmi Chowk and Islamabad” and not in Balochistan.
He claimed that the chief minister remained unaware of the ground realities while the NGOs carrying out relief activities focused cities alone. He said that army medical teams were seen, the civilian health authorities were not there. 
He said the state and its institutions should play their role, adding that people who had suffered damages should be compensated. He urged that the federal government should approach international agencies to seek financial assistance. 
Jalal slams ‘favouritism’ in relief work
Sindh United Party chairman and Sindh Action Committee (SAC) convener Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah has severely criticised what he termed favouritism and discrimination in relief operations on political grounds.
In a statement issued here on Wednesday, he said it was highly deplorable that political considerations were linked with relief work. He said that due to the bad political culture and corruption of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government, there was a dearth of honest officers in Sindh.
He said that millions were displaced in Sindh due to rains and flash floods, but it was due to bad governance and incompetence of the PPP government that they were living on footpaths along with their livestock.
He added that thousands of such displaced persons were living in Karachi, Hyderabad and Jamshoro without any facility. He demanded that competent persons should be tasked with relief responsibilities so that they could make arrangements of tent cities in Karachi, Hyderabad and other areas.
He said the displaced persons should be provided food and other necessities. Calling for provision of relief goods to them immediately, he asked nationalist workers, journalists and political activists for setting up relief camps and give succour to those people affected by rains.

15,From furnace to flood: world’s hottest city now under water,"JACOBABAD: Not long ago, Sara Khan, principal at a school for disadvantaged girls in Jacobabad, looked on in alarm ...","JACOBABAD: Not long ago, Sara Khan, principal at a school for disadvantaged girls in Jacobabad, looked on in alarm as some students passed out from the heat — the city was the world’s hottest at one point in May.
Now, after heavy monsoon rains submerged large parts of the country, her classrooms are flooded and many of the 200 students homeless, struggling to get enough food and caring for injured relatives.
Such extreme weather events in a short space of time have caused havoc across the country, killing hundreds of people, cutting off communities, wrecking homes and infrastructure and raising concerns over health and food security.
Jacobabad has not been spared. In May, temperatures topped 50 degrees Celsius, drying up canal beds and causing some residents to collapse from heatstroke. Today, parts of the city are under water, though flooding has receded from its peak.
In Khan’s neighbourhood in the east of the city, houses have been badly damaged. On Thursday, she said she heard cries from a neighbour’s house when the roof collapsed from water damage, killing their nine-year-old son.
Many of her students are unlikely to return to school for months, having already lost class time during the brutal summer heatwave.
“Jacobabad is the hottest city in the world, there are so many challenges ... before people had heatstroke, now people have lost their homes, almost everything [in the flood], they have become homeless,” she said.
More than 40,000 people are living in temporary shelters, mostly in crowded schools with limited access to food.
One of the displaced, 40-year-old Dur Bibi, sat under a tent in the grounds of a school and recalled the moment she fled when water gushed into her home overnight late last week.
“I grabbed my children and rushed out of the house with bare feet,” she said, adding that the only thing they had time to take with them was a copy of the Koran.
Four days later, she has not been able to obtain medicine for her daughter who is suffering from a fever.
“I have nothing, besides these kids. All of the belongings in my home have been swept away,” she said. The level of disruption in Jacobabad demonstrates some of the challenges extreme weather events linked to climate change can create.
“A manifestation of climate change is the more frequent and more intense occurrence of extreme weather events, and this is exactly what we have witnessed in Jacobabad as well as elsewhere globally during the past few months,” said Athar Hussain, head of the Centre for Climate Research and Development at COMSATS University in Islamabad.
A study earlier this year by the World Weather Attri­bution group, an international team of scientists, found that the heatwave that hit Pakistan in March and April was made 30 times more likely by climate change.
In Jacobabad, local health, education and development officials said record temperatures followed by unusually heavy rains were straining vital services.
Hospitals that set up emergency heatstroke response centres in May are now reporting an influx of people injured in the floods and patients suffering from gastroenteritis and skin conditions amid unsanitary conditions.
Jacobabad Institute of Medical Sciences (JIMS) said it had treated around 70 people in recent days for injuries from debris in floods including deep cuts and broken bones.
More than 800 children were admitted to JIMS for gastroenteritis conditions in August during heavy rains, compared to 380 the previous month, hospital data showed.
Rizwan Shaikh, head officer at Jacobabad’s Meteorology Office, recorded a high temperature of 51 degrees centigrade in May. Now he is tracking persistent heavy rainfall and notes with alarm that there are two more weeks of the monsoon season to go.
“All the districts are in a very tense situation,” he said.
