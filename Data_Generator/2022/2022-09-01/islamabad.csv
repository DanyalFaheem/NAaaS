The directives have been issued after members of the committee showed displeasure over data regarding the NHA contracts system submitted by the authority and directed the ministry to provide a detailed summary of the pre-qualification and bidding process.
Convener of the committee Senator Saifullah Abro stressed that the pre-qualification process should be transparent and bids awarded on merit. 
He directed the NHA to follow international standards in auctioning contracts.
The subcommittee reviewed various completed and ongoing projects by the National Highway Authority (NHA) from 2008 onwards to identify cost overruns.
The committee was informed that there were 33 projects that were completed at increased cost, which was almost 13pc more than the initial bid. 
Main reasons for increased costs of projects were difference between financial funds and financial phasing in PC-I, cost escalation, additional scope of work and land acquisition issues.
The committee reviewed the Larkana–Khairpur bridge project; Lakhi–Naudero–Larkana project, Zhob–Mughal Kot project and the Larkana–Moenjodaro Road project and Hyderabad–Sukkur Road project.

2,CDA goes for rented machinery once again for capital’s cleanliness,Officials claim funds were sufficient to procure own equipment; spokesman says efforts afoot to finalise PC-I to buy machinery.,"ISLAMABAD: Instead of procuring their own machinery, the city managers are all set to issue work orders for rented machinery against a whopping cost of almost Rs500 million for six months.
“Yes, after competitive process, in which two companies participated, we had received the lowest bid which was a little over Rs1 billion for hiring machinery for one year. The lowest bid was 17pc above the Notice Inviting Tender (NIT) cost (Rs870 million),” said Capital Development Authority (CDA) spokesperson Syed Asif Raza.
Director General Civic Management Shahjahan said the new contract would be for six months, adding that CDA Chairman retired Capt Mohammad Usman had approved the file for a six-month period. He said soon work orders for six months would be issued.
“We have called tender for one year, but we got approval of the chairman for six months,” he said.

Officials claim funds were sufficient to procure own equipment; spokesperson says efforts underway to finalise PC-I to purchase machinery

CDA officials Dawn spoke to said Mr Usman had nothing to do with the procurement of machinery, adding that the bidding process took place before the new chairman’s joining.
It is relevant to note here that during the last two years, the CDA had announced that instead of hiring private machinery, it would procure its own machinery which would be an asset for the civic agency.
Subsequently, in September last year, CDA’s Development Working Party (DWP) also took up the agenda for approval of PC-I worth Rs689 million for the project titled ‘Procurement of Machinery to Upgrade Sanitation Services in Islamabad’.
But, the civic agency, which had surplus budget in its kitty, surprisingly failed to procure its own machinery. This negligence of CDA raises several questions as many officials believe that the fund, which CDA will spend on paying for rented machinery to some extent, could be sufficient to procure its own machinery.
“We received bid of Rs1 billion for one year for rented machinery. I guess, this amount would have been sufficient to purchase brand new machinery,” an official said.
However, CDA’s spokesperson said efforts were underway to finalise PC-I for procurement of machinery.
He said the said contract for hiring machinery was held in a transparent manner and this time round, the CDA had extended its operations to rural areas as well.
When asked about the high bid price as compared to last year’s bid (which was Rs510 million for one year) he said massive increase in diesel and petrol prices were the main reasons behind the increase in bid rate, adding that according to the tender, the contractor would ply 72 units (small and big vehicles) for the cleanliness operation.
In the past, the CDA used to hire services of private sanitation workers, however, this time round, the civic agency had its own staff as recently it completed the process of hiring over 900 workers.
Despite repeated attempts, the CDA chairman could not be approached for his comments.

4,Senate body debates bill seeking change in disqualification clause,Committee head seeks reply from law ministry stating whether it is accepting or opposing the amendment.,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice on Wednesday initiated a debate on a bill seeking to amend Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution regarding disqualification of a person as the member of the Parliament for not being Ameen (honest).  
The private member’s bill moved by PML-N’s Rana Maqbool Ahmed on May 23 was taken up by the committee which met under the chairmanship of Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar.
According to a statement, Barrister Zafar said the wording of Article 62(1)(f) was vague because it was highly difficult to determine who was sagacious and advised that a debate should take place on the matter. The committee members suggested that it should also be debated as to whether there should be any time limit set if the person was disqualified under Article 62(1)(f).
The committee chairman pointed out that the matter of time limit has been settled by the Supreme Court in a judgement in which has decided that if a person is found to be dishonest then he be disqualified from being a member of the parliament for life. 
However, Barrister Zafar further pointed out that this was for the Parliament to debate and decide if they want to restrict the time limit of disqualification for future matters.
The chairman then directed the law ministry to provide a written reply as to whether the law ministry is accepting or opposing the amendment and also directed the Islamic Ideology Council to give its comments.
The committee members also discussed another bill moved by PPP Senator Farooq H. Naek seeking amendment to Article 142 of the constitution. 
Under the proposed amendment to this article, power should be given to the Federal Legislature to make amendments in the Civil Procedure Code, Contract Act and other matters.
With regard to amendment to Article 142, Barrister Zafar pointed out that this was a matter which related to the 18th Amendment and therefore requires consideration and accordingly directed the Law Ministry to give comments in writing as well. 
The law secretary pointed out that the ministry has no objection. However, Barrister Zafar directed that the ministry should give its comments in writing and give reasons whether the amendment is acceptable or not.

5,Action sought for strengthening response to natural disasters,"Experts discuss water risks in twin cities, strategies to mitigate them...","ISLAMABAD: In the wake of recent floods and resulting damages across the country, the World Wide Fund (WWF) for Nature Pakistan stressed on the need to act immediately to strengthen response towards climate-induced natural hazards which pose a grave threat to critical habitats, natural capital, people and their livelihoods.
Under the ambit of the Australia-Pakistan Water Security Initiative (APWASI), WWF-Pakistan organised a dialogue on ‘Urban Water Management’ to bring to the fore, challenges to surface and groundwater management and how water governance can be improved.
The aim of arranging this was promotion of open and constructive dialogue in order to mobilise resources, foster new partnerships, adopt locally-driven solutions and making measurable improvements towards sustainable water use and water stewardship in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
The forum, comprising a network of public, private and civil society actors, developed a common understanding of water risks in the twin cities and participants highlighted key priority water risks and suggested instrumental strategies to mitigate these risks.

Experts discuss water risks in twin cities, strategies to mitigate them

WWF-Pakistan Director GeneralHammad Naqi Khan said for a country like Pakistan, climate crisis was a water crisis.
The scope and applicability of adopting the Water Sensitive Cities (WSCs) vision for Pakistan was also discussed, which is a nature-based approach (NBA) that focuses on management of the water cycle to make cities more liveable, resilient, sustainable and productive. 
An overview of APWASI along with success stories from demonstration sites were shared with the participants.
John Snobar, the acting first secretary development (Australian High Commission), lauded efforts from all project partners and government departments including Capital Development Authority (CDA), Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) and Ministry of Water Resources for supporting APWASI and its activities. He also mentioned that this year’s monsoon rains had taken more than 1,000 lives and affected 33 million people. 
Mr Snobar said that the Australian foreign minister had announced $2 million in urgent humanitarian assistance in response to the devastating floods in Pakistan. So far, he said, 100 rainwater harvesting systems and three filtration plants had been installed under APWASI, adding that this would be the starting point for promoting adoption of the WSC vision in Pakistan.
Sardar Khan Zimri, deputy director general (water management) CDA, expressed his support for activities related to the project. He added that CDA was focusing on integrating sustainable water management in its development programmes.
Other representatives from the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR), International Water Management Institute (IWMI), CDA, Wasa, research and academia, and other non-governmental organisations (NGOs)convened to pledge their support towards developing and adopting locally-driven, low-cost solutions to improve access and availability of water and ensure sustainable water use and stewardship. Community representatives from the APWASI demonstration sites also shared their water woes and experiences about the successful transformation of their communities.
Participants were informed that the City-Wide Partnership Forum would serve as a springboard for the exchange of ideas, information and lessons learned and would facilitate the government in informed policy and decision making on urban water crisis.

7,Reforms needed to make election process credible: speakers,ISLAMABAD: Speakers at an event on Wednesday stressed the need for electoral reforms to make election process...,"ISLAMABAD: Speakers at an event on Wednesday stressed the need for electoral reforms to make election process credible.
Speaking at “National Conference: Electoral Reforms – Making Elections Credible” organised by Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) in partnership with the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom (FNF) at local hotel, they called for protecting the interests of vulnerable and marginalised groups.
Birgit Lamm, Pakistan head of FNF, said that citizens should be informed of their electoral rights and responsibilities, while HRCP secretary-general Harris Khalique pointed out that ‘federalism and equal citizenship are key parts of the democratic process.’
Former PPP senator Farhatullah Babar said that the credibility of elections had always been suspected.
Arshad Dad, former secretary-general of PTI, said it was important to move beyond ‘the influence of money and biraderi in electoral politics.’
Responding to his comment that voters should be ‘educated’ for the democratic process to be more effective, National Democratic Movement chairman Mohsin Dawar contended that ‘illiterate voters often have more political wisdom than those who hold PhDs.’
As part of the panel examining polling procedures and voter enfranchisement, National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) chairman Tariq Malik said that even though Nadra had achieved over 96pc registration, it was necessary to capture all remaining missing voters.
PPP leader Taj Haider suggested that returning officers should post images of Form 45 to the ECP website for greater transparency of results.
Former National Commission on the Status of Women chairperson Khawar Mumtaz recommended a 20pc minimum requirement for women voters’ turnout to give parties a greater stake in pushing for women’s registration.
Rashid Chaudhry of Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) said polling stations should not be more than 1 kilometre from voters’ area of residence.
HRCP Council member Husain Naqi added that accurate census could only ensure fair election.
Romana Bashir of the Peace and Development Foundation concurred, saying that religious minorities should have greater representation on parties’ core committees.
Information commissioner Zahid Abdullah underscored the need for an ‘organic movement’ to mainstream the electoral participation of persons living with disabilities.
Speaking on the electoral process in the context of ‘fake news’, senior journalist Suhail Warraich emphasised that reporting should remain bias-free, while former PFUJ president Shahzada Zulfiqar pointed out that, in the race for breaking news, the role of the editor had receded.
Digital rights activist Usama Khilji explained that countering disinformation required greater digital literacy, a culture of fact-checking in media houses, and social media codes of conduct for political parties.
HRCP chairperson Hina Jilani concluded the conference by saying that ‘the foundation of electoral reforms should be the right to participation at every stage. However, participation is a means to empowerment, not an end in itself.’

10,"Paintings explore feminine influence in mythology, mysticism","ISLAMABAD: The Satrang Gallery inaugurated a group show, The Unwritten, featuring the works of Anushka Rustomji, ...","ISLAMABAD: The Satrang Gallery inaugurated a group show, The Unwritten, featuring the works of Anushka Rustomji, Bibi Hajra, Emaan Mahmud and Natasha Malik.
The gallery’s director, Asma Rashid, said: “In light of the recent devastation caused by the floods, Satrang Gallery is donating part of its sales towards supporting the relief efforts of International Network for Traditional Building, Architecture and Urbanism (INTBAU Pakistan) in building pre-fab bamboo shelter homes with zero carbon footprint. Besides showcasing the best in contemporary art, Satrang Gallery has always strived to be socially responsible”.
The curator, Zahra Khan, said: “The Unwritten explores the female or feminine influence in mythology and mysticism. The exhibition seeks to honour the legacies of female practitioners and acknowledge their often-forgotten contributions through the perspectives of these four artists.”
She said: “South Asia has a strong and beautiful culture of mystic thought and mythological lore. In this exhibition, the artists deal with aspects of feminine influences upon these legends of mysticism, mythology and particularly the representation of women in shared culture and memory. These legends have been passed down through oral histories and some written texts. In a primarily male centric society, they have often been retold through male-gendered lens. The voices of female practitioners have been quietened - purposefully and accidentally. At times they have been vilified and at others celebrated.”
Anushka Rustomji’s practice is influenced by the themes of history and erasure, in reference to colonisation and diasporic communities. Her visual vocabulary is informed by ancient Eastern imagery, texts and traditions. She utilises the symbolism in texts and myths to form veiled visual narratives conveying ideas of creation and destruction, survival and transcendence, through which she interrogates cultural and historical connotations.
Bibi Hajra addresses urban segregation and development, and recently religious symbolism and aesthetics. Her recent work focuses on the shrine of Bibian Pak Daman, documenting and depicting the lives of women devotees and the various narratives of the saint Bibi Ruqqaiya, the daughter of Hazrat Ali, that are shared within that space.
Ms Hajra says, “Bibian Pak Daman is at the centre of Islamic geography. My work experiments with the linkages between the hagiographies and discourses of Bibi Ruqqaiya and her companions and the everyday conversations in her shrine as it undergoes renovation since the last two years.”
Emaan Mahmud’s work explores the presence and absence of sexuality in the female body. Amidst the collisions between East and West, spirituality vs institutionalised religion, women’s bodies become a battleground where different beliefs and thoughts clash. The abstracted drawings of the body and fabric, is a visualisation of societally-imposed collective body shame which somehow coexists with acceptance of the self.
Explaining her work, Natasha Malik said: “My work focuses on feminine mythology. In one of my pieces, titled ‘Parastoo slaying the Tree of Evil Tongues’, I have created a powerful character or being who has control over her own narrative and has her own agency. The film piece and other works are inspired by feminist surrealist and are about the cycle of life and death as experienced through the body and perspective of a woman. All these women are meant to be strong, inspirational figures and connect with my other work which deals directly with patriarchal structures and female identity within them”.
Malik’s practice encompasses painting, sculpture, printmaking, film and photography. An ongoing concern in her work, is the exploration of female identity and sexuality developed within the constraints of patriarchy. The imagery of the female form in complex and confining architectural spaces examined the tensions arising from a desire for independence from patriarchal structures.
A visitor, Abdaal Bukhari, said: “I personally feel this is a great exhibition. It is giving female artists an opportunity to exhibit what they feel about society and how they depict themselves in their artwork through varied media and perspectives”.
Zahra Jadoon, another visitor to Satrang, said: “The exhibition was very powerful; it talked about the feminine perspective and the information and women who have been lost in time. As a woman, it led me to reflect on these matters”.
She also appreciated the contributions of the artists and the Gallery in helping the people of Pakistan and supporting relief efforts.

11,NDMA extends support to INGOs for flood-relief activities,"Authorities laud efforts of Pakistan Humanitarian Forum, a coordination forum of 38 INGOs.","ISLAMABAD: The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) as well as the provincial provincial disaster management authorities (PDMAs) have extended support to international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) to carry out relief and rescue services in different flood-hit areas of the country.
In a meeting on Wednesday, relevant authorities lauded the efforts of Pakistan Humanitarian Forum (PHF), the coordination forum of 38 INGOs operating in the country for immediately starting response activities.
The PHF has urged all government institutions to provide full support to humanitarian agencies so that they play a very strong role in this time of need.
In a statement, PHF Country Coordinator Syed Shahid Kazmi said it was time to focus more on collective actions and effective coordination at all levels for intensive humanitarian response.
He said in these critical times, the PHF members were receiving support from PDMAs and NDMA to carry out relief and rescue services in different parts of the country, adding that the spokesperson of the Balochistan government also assured full support to the PHF members.
The forum said the current largescale humanitarian crisis required combined efforts and capacity from all stakeholders working in Pakistan, both national and international.
“While the scale of the emergency demands a higher level of international solidarity to respond to the damages of flood-affected persons in Pakistan, the INGOs were able to mobilise a sizeable amount of funds rapidly to reach out to more than half a million people in Pakistan,” he said.
Meanwhile, in a separate statement WaterAid, a UK-based INGO operating in Pakistan, pointed out that thousands of flood-hit families had been provided hygiene kits with soap, towels and jerrycans, disinfection of water resources and safely managed toilets.
WaterAid has initially allocated Rs30 million as emergency relief to over 40,000 people affected by the floods with the help of its local partners in Badin, Rajanpur and Swat districts, focused on disinfection of drinking water sources, provision of hygiene kits and construction of temporary toilets in schools and camps.
WaterAid Pakistan Country Director Arif Jabbar Khan said people affected by a natural disaster are forced to drink contaminated water, which leads to outbreak of diseases.
“Our initial response is for two months but we will continue to expand our response as we raise more funds,” he added.
