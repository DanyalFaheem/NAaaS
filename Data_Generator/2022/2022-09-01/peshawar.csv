The control room at Directorate General Health Services will ensure active surveillance and robust response to all kinds of health related emergencies and cope with challenges triggered by incessant flood in the province.
Officials told this scribe health department had so far received more than 104,543 patients from 110 camps in 19 districts. They said that most of the flood survivors suffered from diarrhoea, skin diseases and acute respiratory infections.
They said that the department would receive emergency kits from World Health Organisation and Unicef as part of cooperation to prevent the occurrence of hygiene-related diseases among the displaced people. “We have appealed to the United Nations and other partner organisations for more assistance to deal with the imminent outbreaks of diseases among flood victims,” they said.

Health dept sets up control room to monitor situation round the clock

Abdullah Fadil, the representative of Unicef in Pakistan, told journalists that the affected communities needed to be immediately supported with shelter, medicines, nutrition, food, clean drinking water and sanitation facilities.
During a visit to a camp, housing victims of the recent flood on Manki Road in Nowshera district, on Wednesday, he urged the authorities to expedite efforts to provide emergency medical relief to the displaced people.
The Unicef representative said that people were vulnerable to host of ailments in the aftermath of the flood and required prompt assistance to ensure that they stayed away from getting more health issues in those trying times.
Unicef provided more than 1,500 hygiene kits to the members of the affected communities, especially women and children. These kits would benefit more than 9,000 people affected by flood in the district. The kits given to the flood-hit people included jerry cans, buckets, bathing and washing soaps and other items related to personal hygiene.
Mr Fadil said that the resilience shown by the people of Nowshera during the time of crises was highly commendable as they patiently waited to receive assistance.
He said that in response to the major calamity that affected at least 33 million people and caused serious damage to infrastructure including homes and standing crops across the country, a herculean effort was needed by the government and its development partners for urgent medical needs of people and subsequent rehabilitation.
He said that Unicef was in the field and collaborating with the government authorities to provide immediate assistance in terms of health, nutrition, clean drinking water and sanitation to people to put brakes on outbreaks of diseases.
“Our organisation is soon beginning a programme to ensure provision of safe drinking water through tankers to people affected by incessant spells of monsoon rains,” said Mr Fadil.

7,PHC seeks govt reply to plea against chicken export ban,PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has directed the provincial government to respond to a petition against the...,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has directed the provincial government to respond to a petition against the livestock department’s ban on the export of broiler chickens to Afghanistan.
A bench consisting of Justice Roohul Amin Khan and Justice Shahid Khan fixed Sept 8 for next hearing into the petition by the Provincial Poultry Association against that chicken export ban.
The petitioner claims that the livestock director had overstepped his jurisdiction and issued an illegal order regarding the ban.
Lawyer Zafar Tahirkheli appeared for the petitioner and contended that the Constitution didn’t allow the director to slap a ban on the export of an item.
He argued that the federal trade and commerce ministry was empowered to deal with the issues of export and import and not the director (livestock).
The counsel contended that the ban imposed by the director had adversely affected poultry traders in the province and that no suitable reason was given for the move.
He argued that if the provincial government had any problem with the export of broiler chickens to Afghanistan, it should raise the issue with the federal government, which was empowered to take decision about it.
The lawyer said that the livestock director had assumed jurisdiction without any legal backing.
During hearing, Justice Roohul Amin observed why the traders had been exporting chickens from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and why they were not getting a quota from Punjab for exporting the same.
The bench observed that apparently, broiler chickens meant for the province had been exported to Afghanistan causing their shortages for the residents.
Mr Tahirkheli said the export had been taking place from Chaman and other border crossings but the same wasn’t allowed via Torkham in an illegal move.
In May last year, the high court had ordered the relevant deputy commissioners to stop the transportation and smuggling of poultry products to Afghanistan.
However, the stay order was vacated next Sept with the court allowing the export of those products to the neighbouring country. Action on the decision was linked to the reduction of chicken prices in the local market.

8,Negligence in flood relief activities unacceptable: KP CM,Mahmood Khan complains he wasn’t informed about PM’s visit to province.,"MANSEHRA/SHANGLA: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan on Wednesday directed the relevant authorities to use helicopters for relief operations in the inaccessible flood-hit areas and said none of the disaster victims should be left without relief goods and healthcare.
“I won’t tolerate any negligence in the supply of relief goods and medicines to flooded areas,” Mr Mahmood told the people hit by the deluge in Pattan area of Lower Kohistan district.
The chief minister said the province had witnessed the worst natural disaster of its history but he won’t rest until all victims were rehabilitated.
He gave away Rs500,000 cheques to the heirs of each of the 12 people, who were killed by the deluge in the district.

Mahmood complains he wasn’t informed about PM’s visit to province

Mr Mahmood said the government had developed a comprehensive strategy for the early return of displaced families to the flood-hit districts.
“We [government] are with you and will not let you down in these critical times,” he said.
The chief minister said the government was providing flood relief to the families without discrimination and had begun a damage assessment survey for compensating people for destroyed and damaged property and crops.
He said he was supervising relief activities in the province, while his government had already begun distribution of compensation cheques.
Deputy commissioner Shakeel Ahmad told the chief minister that the flash floods killed 18 people and swept away roads, bridges and crops in the district.
Also in the day, the chief minister visited flood-affected areas in Shangla district and examined relief operations.
Talking to reporters in Karora area, Mr Mahmood said he ordered an inquiry shortly after learning about the relevant authorities’ alleged negligence regarding the drowning of four people in a flood-swollen river in Dubair area of Upper Kohistan district.
“Anyone found guilty of negligence won’t be spared,” he said.
The chief minister said he had two government choppers on his disposal but they couldn’t fly in bad weather, so its criticism over the death of four people stranded in the river was unjustified.
He complained that the federal government neither took his government on board regarding flood damage and relief activities in the province nor did it provide any support to the latter to manage the crisis.
Mr Mahmood said the prime minister visited the province but didn’t inform him about it.
“I was neither taken on board [about PM’s visit to KP] nor do I know what the federal government is doing in our province’s flood-hit areas,” he said.
The chief minister said if the centre couldn’t offer any help or support to the province, it should at least rehabilitate roads owned by the National Highway Authority and Frontier Works Organisation, power lines laid by the Peshawar Electric Supply Company, and gas pipelines.
He said the life of Sindh residents was miserable after being hit by monsoon flooding but paying them Rs50 each as relief was regrettable.
Mr Mahmood also said neither PPP co-chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari nor the Sindh CM visited any of the calamity-hit areas in their province, which continued to be inundated. He said his helicopters were used for rescue and relief work in Kalam and would be send to Kohistan as well.
“I am visiting the disaster-hit areas to monitor rescue and relief activities,” he said.
The chief minister said his government would build the Karora-Ajmeer Road and Karora-Chekesar Roads with the Asian Development Bank funding.
Shangla deputy commissioner Ziaur Rehman briefed him about the damage caused by floods and relief and rehabilitation activities in the district. Labour minister Shaukat Yousafzai was also present on the occasion.

People residing between Bahrain and Kalam complain about acute shortage of food items

The villagers said that they were short of food items, clean drinking water and medicines. They said that roads, bridges and houses were washed away by flood in their areas.
“So far, no government representative, not even the tehsil chairman, has visited our areas,” they said. They demanded of Peshawar corps commander, chief minister and prime minister to take notice of their ordeal and start rescue and relief operations in their areas immediately.
Meanwhile, the residents of Gabral also appealed to the government and non-governmental organisations for provision of immediate relief.
Talking to this scribe, Malak Zubair and Mohammad Ali, two local elders, said that Gabral and Gujjar Gabral were 90 per cent destroyed by the flood where about 80 houses and shops were washed away while more than 100 houses were partially destroyed.
“Our village received only 20 bags of flour when one helicopter brought the relief. After that our people are lying under the open sky and without food,” they said. They appealed to the district administration to send them food as well as non-food items otherwise people would die of food shortage.

Addressing a news conference at Landi Kotal Press Club on Wednesday, KSI leaders Shah Faisal Afridi, Shereen Afridi, Fazlur Rehman, Malak Zakir and Zahir Shah expressed their concerns over rising incidents of targeted killing, extortion and attacks on security checkposts in recent past.
They said that the presence of suspected militants in parts of Tirah valley caused unrest among locals while law enforcement agencies were constantly denying the presence of such elements in the region.
They said that in order to prevent the resurgence of outlawed groups in Khyber and to remind the government institutions, KSI decided to hold a peaceful but a powerful march on Sept 4.
They said that no party flag would be displayed at the peace march and the participants would carry only white flag to convey the message of peace and protection of common people.
TRAFFIC JAM: Sudden arrival of hundreds of coal-loaded trucks from Afghanistan during the last couple of days has caused severe traffic congestion at Torkham border.
Transporters said that unnecessary checking of loaded and empty trucks by National Logistic Cell staff also delayed movement of vehicles on both sides of the border.
Israrullah, a representative of local transporters, told Dawn that slow movement of loaded and empty trucks delayed custom clearance of Afghanistan-bound trucks, which also caused huge financial losses to most of the transporters and traders.
Amanat Khan, a custom official at Torkham, when approached for comments, said that nearly 700 trucks loaded with coal arrived suddenly at Torkham. The coal would be supplied to a power plant in Pakistan while some empty vehicles were already present on both sides of the border, he added.
He said that the custom staff worked overtime to clear nearly 1,200 vehicles by Monday evening while the rest of the stranded vehicles too would be cleared in due course of time.
He, however, said that the construction of the much delayed Customs terminal too was causing traffic congestion at the border.

14,Peshawar High Court extends stay order against Asad Qaiser inquiry,Ex-NA speaker pleads court to declare FIA probe into PTI funding illegal.,"PESHAWAR: Extending its stay order in favour of former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser until Sept 13, the Peshawar High Court on Wednesday restrained the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from taking any adverse action against him in connection with an inquiry into the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s two bank accounts managed by him.
A bench consisting of Justice Abdul Shakoor and Justice Fazal Subhan told petitioner Qaiser that if he considered it to be necessary, he should file a rejoinder to the FIA’s response to his petition before the next hearing.
It was hearing a petition of Mr Qaiser, who requested it to set aside a notice by a FIA inquiry officer to appear before him in connection with the inquiry into two bank accounts managed by him from 2008 to 2013 as the PTI’s provincial head.
The petitioner pleaded that inquiry be declared illegal and based on mala fide.

Ex-NA speaker pleads court to declare FIA probe into PTI funding illegal

He also sought an interim relief from the court requesting it to suspend action on the inquiry and stop the respondents, including the relevant FIA officials, from issuing ‘adverse’ orders against him until the disposal of the case.
The FIA deputy director (commercial banking circle), Peshawar, had ordered that inquiry in the wake of the Aug 2 pronouncement of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) that the PTI had received funds from prohibited sources.
Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared for the petitioner, whereas additional attorney general Aamir Javed represented the federal government.
Mr Javed said the petitioner, in the garb of the Aug 11 stay order issued by the court, had not been appearing before the inquiry officer despite the issuance of call up notices to him thrice.
He added that the court didn’t stop the FIA from holding the inquiry but the petitioner stayed away the probe.
Mr Gohar said the petition had challenged the FIA’s jurisdiction to hold that inquiry.
He said his client was asked to appear before the inquiry officer on Aug 11 but he couldn’t comply with it for being busy with the case in the high court.
The lawyer said on last hearing, the court stopped the FIA from acting against his client but two notices were issued to him afterwards.
He said he had sent two letters to inquiry officer Irfanullah seeking their recall until Aug 31, the day of hearing into the petition.
Mr Gohar said whenever the petitioner was asked to appear, he would do so.
The lawyer contended that the FIA’s deputy director (CBC), Peshawar and the inquiry officer had assumed jurisdiction to the order passed by the ECP on Aug 2, 2022, and had issued the notice asking his client to appear before the inquiry team on Aug 11 and answer the questions about those bank accounts.
He said the ECP had neither issued any direction nor had it forwarded the case to the federal government for inquiry against the petitioner.
Mr Gohar said the matter did not fall within the ambit of Articles 6(3) and 2(C)(iii) of the Political Parties Order, 2002.
He said the two bank accounts were of the PTI Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s and had nothing to do with the party’s foreign funding.
