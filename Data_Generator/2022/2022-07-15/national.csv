0,Imran ‘deeply hurt’ by detailed SC judgement,Says apex court should have probed cipher to find out who US threat was addressed to.,"DERA GHAZI KHAN: PTI Chairman Imran Khan, expressing his disappointment with the detailed verdict issued by the Supreme Court in suo motu case against the ruling of the deputy speaker on Wednesday night, said the top court should have probed the issue after President Arif Alvi shared it with the chief justice.
“I feel deeply hurt” by the remarks made by the court that there was no investigation regarding the threat letter, Mr Khan said while addressing a rally in Dera Ghazi Khan’s PP-28 constituency on Thursday. “I produced the cipher before the federal cabinet. We have the minutes of the meeting. I took this letter to the meeting of the National Security Committee and even tabled it in parliament,” Imran Khan claimed.
The commission formed by the government to investigate the alleged conspiracy was disbanded after the ouster of the PTI government, the ex-PM said, adding that the letter was even shared with the chief justice. “What else could I have done,” Mr Khan “respectfully” asked the five-member bench that issued the judgement.
According to the PTI chief, the CJP should have investigated the issue when Mr Alvi shared the letter with him. In a reference to suo motu notice that overturned Qasim Suri’s April 3 ruling regarding the dismissal of the no-confidence motion against Mr Khan, the former PM said the top judge took suo motu notice and opened courts at night but an elected PM was removed through an alleged conspiracy yet nothing was done.

Says apex court should have probed cipher to find out who US threat was addressed to

Mr Khan said the court should have investigated to whom this message for the removal of the PM was addressed. If there was no action regarding the conspiracy then in future no prime minister of Pakistan would take a stand for the country, he claimed.
Mr Khan hurled accusations at Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja once again. “CEC Raja, you are the election commissioner for the entire country, but why do you spend three days in Lahore,” he alleged. He claimed to have the “records” of Mr Raja’s meetings with the PML-N and said the nation would not forgive him.
Mr Khan said that despite the nexus of the PML-N and the ‘umpires’, the PTI will emerge victorious in Punjab by-elections.

1,ECP seeks army deployment in five Punjab constituencies,Orders action on reports of presence of armed men in various areas where by-polls are to be held.,"ISLAMABAD: Reports of presence of armed men in various constituencies of Punjab where by-polls on 20 provincial assembly seats are set to take place on Sunday alarmed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), prompting it to direct the relevant authorities to take necessary action swiftly.
Meanwhile, in a late night decision, the commission sought the army’s deployment in five of the 20 constituencies — four in Lahore and one in Multan.
In a letter written to the Punjab chief secretary and the police chief, the ECP said it had come to its notice that armed personnel were present in different constituencies, including Lahore, which was likely to influence and jeopardise the conduct of the upcoming by-elections, besides being a precursor to violence.
“It is also being reported that some notables are planning to bring miscreants from other areas/provinces to create violence and harassment on polling day. Such criminal activities cannot be condoned at any cost. The presence of armed personnel is likely to hinder the voters and peaceful conduct of the polls while being violative of the code of conduct,” the letter stated. The commission asked the provincial administration and law enforcement agencies to take cognizance of such criminal activities. They have been directed to take proactive steps to arrest such miscreants immediately and prevent their further entry into the constituencies.

“It is further informed that wherever administration or police require any direction from the Election Commission in writing that will be provided immediately,” the letter added.
Meanwhile, Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, who presided over a meeting of the ECP on Thursday to review the arrangements for the by-polls, personally spoke to the chief secretary, inspector general of police and senior officials of the agencies concerned over the phone, asking them to ensure a peaceful atmosphere during the elections.
The commission further reminded the authorities that display of all types of weapons in any electoral constituency was prohibited and that no person, candidate or party worker was allowed to display arms.
The Punjab provincial election commissioner, all district returning officers, returning officers and district monitoring officers had been directed to inform law enforcement agencies in writing if any miscreant disturbed the election environment anywhere during the preparation of polling and polling results, and strict action should be ensured against such a person in accordance with the Constitution and law.
It also wrote to the interior ministry for additional Quick Response Force personnel and enhancing flag marches.
Meanwhile, amidst a possible threat of violence during the upcoming by-polls, the ECP called for ensuring the army’s deployment outside polling stations in the four constituencies of Lahore and one of Multan. It noted that Rangers deployment had been agreed earlier, but according to recent reports, the risk of unrest and violence had increased.

3,PPP senator Taj Haider voices concern over possible delay in census,Says delay will disable ECP to allocate seats in NA to each province on basis of its actual population.,"ISLAMABAD: Chairperson of the Senate Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs Senator Taj Haider has expressed concern over reports that the Bureau of Statistics would be unable to complete the 7th census before the fixed date of Dec 31.
Talking to reporters, he said this delay would disable the Election Commission of Pakistan to carry out their constitutional responsibility of the allocation of seats in the National Assembly to each province on the basis of its actual population and to carry out delimitation of national and provincial assemblies’ constituencies in all provinces.
Senator Haider pointed out that the Council of Common Interests’ majority decision to validate the faulty figures of the 6th census was conditional to holding a fresh and accurate census in the country. A time line for completing the fresh census was also specified in the CCI decision.
It was unacceptable that only the controversial and harmful part of the CCI decision should be implemented and the agreed and the beneficial part is ignored and bypassed. Such unjust and discriminatory actions cut at the root of the country’s federal system and weaken the federation by creating mistrust, he added.
One fails to understand the reason for not including any representative from Sindh in the advisory group made by the Bureau of Statistics for making a working paper for the 7th census, the PPP senator said.
While most of the persons responsible for the controversial 6th census were included in the advisory group, Dr Mehtab Karim’s name from Sindh was included only after the working paper had been finalised and after strong protest from Sindh on his exclusion. There certainly is method behind this madness, he said.
Senator Taj Haider reminded that before the 24th Amendment was passed in the Senate, all political parties represented in the house had signed an agreement which had specified a recount methodology for correcting the controversial figures of the 6th census.

4,‘Violators of Constitution’ must face treason cases: Maryam,"Says SC's detailed judgement on Qasim Suri's ruling has exposed Imran's ""fake politics"".","GUJAR KHAN: Violators of the Constitution should be tried for treason under Article 6 in the wake of the Supreme Court’s judgement that former prime minister Imran Khan had done so on April 3 by dissolving the National Assembly, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz said in a speech at a rally in Kallar Syedan on Thursday.
“This matter should not be closed and treason cases be initiated so that nobody even thinks of violating the Constitution,” she observed.
Maryam Nawaz said the detailed SC verdict had exposed the “fake politics” of Imran Khan. “Imran is the only politician in the country’s history branded a liar and violator of the Constitution by the apex court.”
Imran Khan had even outdone dictators by “making a mockery” of the Constitution, Ms Nawaz added.
Recalling that an SC judge had said no evidence of foreign conspiracy was provided by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Maryam Nawaz said Imran Khan had lied to the nation about an “American conspiracy”.
She said the Supreme Court’s decision had exposed the “Sadiq and Ameen of (former Chief Justice) Saqib Nisar”, a reference to the ex-CJP’s observation in 2018 that Imran Khan was a truthful and honest person.
The PML-N leader took a swipe at the PTI chief for accusing the Punjab government of pre-poll rigging.
She said Imran Khan should thank his stars because he is free to hold rallies across the country while in opposition.
On the other hand, she recalled, Nawaz Sharif was put behind bars before the 2018 elections while she herself was jailed for “assisting my father”.
“This is pre-poll rigging indeed.”
Maryam Nawaz also criticised the former prime minister for keeping his two sons in London. She said banning the speeches of Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz was pre-poll rigging.
“The PML-N candidates were pressured to return their tickets and disqualified, This is pre-poll rigging,” she said.
Maryam Nawaz said the Punjab government had shown “magnanimity” by allowing PTI leaders to carry on their election campaign without any restrictions, alleging that the Imran government had put severe curbs on PML-N leaders’ movement when it was in power. Ms Nawaz praised Raja Sagheer Ahmed, the PML-N candidate from PP-7, saying that he had scorned “offers of Rs 180 million to join PTI”.
Maryam Nawaz later addressed a rally at Khushab to bolster the candidature of her party’s nominee for by-election to PP83. a Punjab Assembly seat.
The seat fell vacant after Ghulam Rasool Singha’s disqualification under the defection clause.
Maryam urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to initiate proceedings against Imran Khan and his associates who “served as personal servants” of the former premier instead of working for the country.
The PML-N vice president claimed that difficult decisions had already been made and now only “good news” would come every day. Maryam said Shehbaz Sharif was determined to serve the nation and urged the people to vote for the PML-N candidate if they want an easing of inflation.

5,French envoy sees mutual desire for fresh start in ties,Believes that the bad patch in ties was related to “specific events” and both sides now want to get past it.,"ISLAMABAD: Ambassador of France Nicolas Galey says that both Pakistan and France are desirous of a fresh start in bilateral relations.
In an interview, Mr Galey, who took office earlier this year, said: “There is a mutual will to turn the page.”
Relations between Pakistan and France became strained in October 2020 over President Emmanuel Macron’s backing for ‘blasphemous caricatures’ following the murder of Samuel Paty, a high-school teacher.
Ties got particularly frayed after then prime minister Imran Khan accused President Macron of encouraging anti-Muslim sentiments.

Ties between Pakistan and France became strained after Macron accused of backing ‘anti-Muslim sentiment’

Religious group Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan held violent protests demanding expulsion of the French diplomat and the matter was referred to parliament.
In April 2021, the French embassy in Islamabad advised the French nationals living in Pakistan and business companies to leave because of threats to interests of France.
Mr Galey believes that the bad patch in ties was related to “specific events” and both sides now want to get past it.
“That (episode) belongs to the past and I think everybody wishes that it belongs to the past,” he said, adding that the two countries wished that it would no longer be a problem in the bilateral relations.
He recalled that the fence-mending process had begun under the PTI government and the current administration had carried it forward.
“I was received by the foreign secretary the day after my arrival (in January), I could present my credentials very quickly afterwards and all the contacts I had within the government, obviously the previous government, but that has continued with the new one,” he said.
Former prime minister Imran Khan had in one of his interviews in February said that his government had begun the process for appointing Pakistan’s ambassador in Paris. The position fell vacant in 2020 summer after Ambassador Moinul Haq was transferred to China because of the caricature row.
The process was started afresh after the new government took office and reportedly the government would be announcing the appointment of the ambassador to France soon.
Federal minister Naveed Qamar visited Paris towards the end of May — just ahead of elections and signed an agreement on diversification of trade and economic relations.
In a related development, Pakistan and France had on June 27 signed an agreement for the suspension of repayment of loans amounting to $107 million under the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative.
In the middle of June, Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa made an unannounced three-day visit to Paris from June 13 to 16 for attending Eurosatory, a defence trade exhibition. He also held bilateral meetings during the visit, which Ambassador Galey confirmed.
“We were very happy to have Gen Bajwa participating in this exhibition,… he must have had some bilateral engagements on the sideline as well,” he said, adding that this was, however, “not the moment where big decisions are taken”.
Souring of ties because of blasphemous caricatures may have got the spotlight, but Islamabad’s unhappiness with Paris started much before that — and it was over French Rafael deal with India.
Protesting over the deal, the Foreign Office had on the occasion of the delivery of first batch of jets in July 2020 had accused the West of “aiding and abetting” Indian arms build-up through “exemptions, waivers and supply of advanced equipment, technology and weapons for its narrow commercial interests”. Pakistan too has defence cooperation with France, which focusses on military training, exchange and transfer of expertise.
Ambassador Galey said: “cooperation in the field of defence with Pakistan is continuing and there is absolutely no interruption or move or intention to change the current situation in this area of cooperation”.
In the midst of this re-engagement, Paris, which in 2018 was the one of the major backers of the move to get Pakistan grey- listed by Financial Action Task Force, acknowledged the progress made by Islamabad on checking illicit financing.
That helped at the last FATF plenary which concluded that Pakistan had “substantially completed” the two action plans, and an on-site visit by a technical team was approved.
The French envoy said: “There were no particular French reservations in the last phase, but again it’s a collective decision so those who continue to have reservations of course has fully the right to ask for more.”
Getting a new deal on the GSP+ status will be a bit more complicated.
Pakistan’s GSP+ status, which gives it preferential access to EU markets with zero duty on several products, is set to expire on December 31, 2023.
“There is a process of renegotiation. It’s not only a rollover or continuation of the previous agreement since the principles and the basis of GSP plus have been changed. It means it’s not only just to continue the previous agreement but it’s to sign a new agreement,” he said and noted that France wouldn’t be of much help at the negotiations stage as those will be conducted by Pakistan with the European Commission and other institutions.
France would, however, support any scheme that helps Pakistan improve and develop its economy, he said.

6,"Govt, ‘personalities’ using all means to rig Punjab by-polls: PTI","Claims ""more stringent conditions"" have been accepted to finalise IMF deal.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has alleged that PML-N-led coalition government and some personalities are using all possible means to rig the by-election scheduled to be held on 20 seats of the Punjab Assembly on July 17.
The opposition party also criticised the federal government for accepting what it called “more stringent conditions” to conclude an agreement with IMF.
In a series of tweets, PTI’s central senior vice president Dr Shireen Mazari alleged that efforts were being made to manipulate the by-elections.
She announced holding protest rallies against the personalities and institutions which she said were involved in the alleged rigging.

Claims ‘more stringent conditions’ have been accepted to finalise IMF deal

“We want free and fair elections; don’t push us to the wall. People are with the PTI and we will not allow the government, which came to power through the US conspiracy, to rob the mandate of people,” Ms Mazari said.

 





 
She said the PTI had a number of times warned the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) to stop efforts of rigging in the coming by-elections.
The PTI leader said her party would not stay silent if any attempt was made to rig the elections.
“We will strongly react in case of even a minute interference by personalities or institutions in the by-elections. We will hold protests outside the offices in Lahore and Multan,” she said without mentioning the name of any person or institution.
She warned that the economy of the country would not be able to afford the protest and unrest which would be triggered by the alleged rigging.
Meanwhile, former finance minister Shaukat Tarin has suggested that the government should provide relief to the masses in accordance with decline in prices of petroleum products in the international market.
“The recent decline in the world Crude oil prices warrants a reduction of Rs44 per litre in both the petrol and diesel. Let’s not play politics with the people and pass on the entire benefit on the present price of Brent at $97 a barrel,” he tweeted.

 





 
While criticising the agreement with IMF, he said “Imported used to curse us for a bad IMF program. Why have they extended it and with more stringent conditions. The IMF cites delayed actions by the present government for the present mess. If approved by IMF board, funds will be released in late August..still 6 weeks to go and anything can happen”.

 





 
PTI’s Secretary General for Central Punjab Hammad Azhar, in a tweet, alleged that IMF had prepared a new plan for more price hike in the country.

 





 
He alleged that the government had failed to get any relief from the IMF and because of it Rs50 per liter tax would be imposed on petroleum products in the next six months.
He also claimed that the price of electricity would also be increased by Rs8 per unit which would result into price hike.

7,SC verdict exposed Imran’s ‘lies’ of regime change: PM,ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the detailed judgement issued by the Supreme Court on...,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the detailed judgement issued by the Supreme Court on Wednesday had exposed the “pack of lies” of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan who did propaganda that the no-confidence vote against him was in fact the outcome of regime change.
“Honourable Supreme Court’s detailed judgement on Vote of No Confidence exposes the lies and propaganda indulged in by Imran Khan and company,” the prime minister said in a tweet.
Mr Sharif termed it utterly shameful how Mr Khan tried to undermine the Constitution and manufactured the lie of regime change.
“The judgement is a must-read for everyone,” he stressed.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued a detailed judgement explaining the reasons behind its decision to set aside a controversial ruling by the National Assembly speaker on April 3 that dismissed the no-confidence motion against then prime minister Imran Khan.
In the verdict authored by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, the top judge stated that by dismissing the no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri prima facie breached his constitutional duty.
Justice Bandial also said that the April 3 ruling failed to qualify for the protection of the internal proceedings of parliament under Article 69(1) as it was not the outcome of a vote in the National Assembly instead, it was a unilateral decision.
