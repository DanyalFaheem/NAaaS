US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid signed a joint pledge on Thursday to deny Iran nuclear arms, a show of unity by allies long divided over diplomacy with Tehran.
“The great nation of Iran will not accept any insecurity or crisis in the region and Washington and its allies should know that any mistake will be met by a harsh and regrettable response from Iran,” Raisi said during a speech.
Washington and Israel have long expressed concerns over Iran’s nuclear capabilities. Iran insists it never had any ambition to make a nuclear bomb.

“I am ...","WASHINGTON: Ivana Trump, former US president Donald Trump’s first wife, died on Thursday. She was 73.
“I am very saddened to inform all of those that loved her, of which there are many, that Ivana Trump has passed away at her home in New York City,” Donald Trump said in a post on the social medial platform Truth Social.
The couple married in 1977 and divorced in 1992. They had three children together: Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric.
“Ivana Trump was a survivor. She fled from communism and embraced this country. She taught her children about grit and toughness, compassion and determination,” the Trump family said in a statement quoted by ABC News. She grew up under Communist rule in the former Czechoslovakia. Neither the Trump family statement nor the post from the former president mentioned the cause of her death.

2,Spain advances bill to honour dictatorship victims,MADRID: Spanish lawmakers on Thursday gave the first stamp of approval to a bill which seeks to rehabilitate the...,"MADRID: Spanish lawmakers on Thursday gave the first stamp of approval to a bill which seeks to rehabilitate the memory of leftwing victims of Spain’s 1936-39 civil war and Francisco Franco’s dictatorship.
The proposed law threatens to fuel tensions in a nation where public opinion is still divided over the legacy of the dictatorship that ended with Franco’s death in 1975.
Franco assumed power after the civil war in which his Nationalists defeated Republicans, leaving the country in ruins and mourning hundreds of thousands of dead.
While his regime honoured its own dead, it left its opponents buried in unmarked graves across the country. The  “Democratic Memory” bill, passed in the first reading by the lower house of parliament, will for the first time make unearthing the mass graves a  “state responsibility”.
Up until now the search for the Franco-era disappeared has been carried out by voluntary associations, as was featured in Spanish director Pedro Almodovar’s most recent film  “Parallel Mothers”.
The bill makes Spain  “a better country and definitively turns the page on the darkest period of our history,” the minister in charge of the bill, Felix Bolanos, told parliament ahead of the vote.
It was approved with 173 votes in favour and 159 against.
Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said “there are still 114,000 disappeared” in Spain, mostly Republicans. Only Cambodia has more forcibly disappeared people, he added.

3,Outage briefly hits Twitter service around the world,WASHINGTON: Twitter experienced a widespread but brief outage in nations around the globe on Thursday — fresh...,"WASHINGTON: Twitter experienced a widespread but brief outage in nations around the globe on Thursday — fresh turbulence for the firm locked in a buyout battle with Elon Musk.
The Downdetector website showed that outage reports spiked in the United States around 8am, while users reported service interruptions in France, Germany, Britain, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere.
However, by around 1300 GMT reports of disruptions to Downdetector had plunged and users took to the social media platform with jokes.
“People posting on Twitter that Twitter is down,” @NorthmanTrader tweeted.
Another user, @joelyagar, joked:  “I’ve just had my most productive 30 minutes for years. In unrelated news, it seems Twitter went down for 30 minutes.” Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but acknowledged the service disruption in a tweet.
“Some of you are having issues accessing Twitter and we’re working to get it back up and running for everyone. Thanks for sticking with us,” the firm tweeted.
Service disruptions on social media platforms happen periodically, but major and long-term service outages are not common.
The service problems on Twitter came as the company has embarked on a legal fight with Musk over his moves to walk away from his $44 billion buyout bid that has roiled the company.
Twitter has sued to force Musk to complete the deal after he said he was terminating it over issues including his argument that the company has not been forthcoming about the number of fake accounts.
Musk made his unsolicited bid to buy Twitter without asking for estimates regarding spam or fake accounts, and even sweetened his offer to the board by withdrawing a diligence condition, Twitter’s lawsuit alleged.

4,Russian strikes kill 20 as Zelensky urges ‘special tribunal’ for Moscow,Forty-five nations pledge to coordinate evidence of war crimes in Ukraine.,"KYIV: Russian missiles struck Vinnytsia in central Ukraine on Thursday, killing at least 20 people including three children, in what President Volodymyr Zelensky called  “an open act of terrorism”.
The midday attack on the city hundreds of kilometres from the frontlines and invading Russian troops came as EU officials convened in The Hague to discuss war crimes in Ukraine.
The charred remains of upturned cars surround by burnt debris were seen in images distributed by officials next to a business gutted by a fire with brown smoke billowing nearby.
“There were eight rockets, two of which hit the centre of the city. Twenty people have died, including three children. There a large, large number of wounded,” Zelensky said during an address European official at The Hague.

Forty-five nations pledge to coordinate evidence of war crimes in Ukraine

The Ukrainian leader led a moment of silence before urging European and International Criminal Court officials during an address to open a  “special tribunal” into Russia’s invasion.
“I believe it is inevitable that International Criminal Court will bring accountability to those guilty of crimes under its jurisdiction: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide.”
War crimes tribunal
The  United States and more than 40 other countries agreed on Thursday to  coordinate investigations into suspected war crimes in Ukraine, shortly  after what Kyiv said was a Russian missile strike that killed civilians  far from front lines.
The ICC in The Hague opened an investigation into possible war crimes in Ukraine just days after Moscow’s forces invaded and it dispatched dozens of investigators to the country to gather evidence.
Russia invaded on Feb 24 and the conflict has seen thousands of people killed, destroyed cities and forced millions to flee their homes.
“Every day, Russia kills civilians, kills Ukrainian children, carries out missile attacks on the civilian facilities where there is no military target.
What is this, if not an open act of terrorism?” Zelensky said after the Vinnytsia attack.
A Ukraine military spokesman said its forces had managed to knock out two from a barrage of cruise missiles that were launched from a Russian submarine in the Black Sea and caused widespread damage in Vinnytsia.
Deadly strikes in central Ukraine have become relatively rare, but the war has raged around cities like Mykolaiv in the south which the presidency said was hit by a  “massive missile strike”.
“Two schools, transport infrastructure and a hotel were damaged,” the presidency said in its morning military update early Thursday.
The skeletal insides of one building gutted by the strikes were visible in images distributed by local officials, with municipal workers clearing bricks and rubble strewn after the attack. The heaviest fighting in Ukraine, however, has focused recently on the industrial Donbas region in the east.

5,Fresh Covid wave sweeps Asia; NZ warns of pressure on hospitals,Renewed surge in cases provides a further challenge for authorities grappling with economic fallout of earlier waves.,"WELLINGTON: A new wave of coronavirus infections is rapidly spreading through Asia, prompting warnings for residents from New Zealand to Japan to take precautions to slow the outbreak and help prevent healthcare systems from being overwhelmed.
The renewed surge in cases, mostly of the BA.4/5 Omicron variants, provides a further challenge for authorities grappling with the economic fallout of earlier waves of the pandemic while trying to avoid extending or reintroducing unpopular restrictions.
The New Zealand government on Thursday announced free masks and rapid antigen tests as it tries to relieve pressure on the country’s health system, which is dealing with an influx of both Covid and influenza patients during the southern hemisphere winter.
“There’s no question the combination of a spike in Covid-19 cases and hospitalisations, the worst flu season in recent memory and corresponding staff absences are putting health workers and the whole health system under extreme pressure,” Ayesha Verrall, Minister for Covid-19 Response, said in a statement.
New Zealand, which has a population of 5.1 million, has almost 69,000 currently infected with the virus. Of those, 765 cases are in hospital, which has caused increases in wait times and surgeries to be cancelled.
In Japan, new Covid-19 cases have surged to levels not seen since early this year. The government has called on people to be especially careful ahead of an upcoming long weekend and imminent summer school vacations.
Japan reported almost 95,000 cases on Wednesday and newly infected patients have increased by 2.14-fold compared to the last week, according to a government spokesperson.
“The number of new cases is rising in every prefecture in Japan, and it seems to be rapidly spreading,” Health Minister Shigeyuki Goto said at the start of a committee meeting on dealing with the coronavirus. Tokyo raised its alert level to the highest tier.
“Tomorrow, we will hold a meeting of the task force to decide on measures to be taken this summer, taking into consideration the national trend and the opinions of experts,” Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said at a meeting.
Like New Zealand, South Korea was praised for its response early in the pandemic, but by Wednesday, daily cases there had tripled in a week to more than 39,000.
Officials and experts expect South Korea’s new daily cases to reach 200,000 by around mid-August to end-September and are expanding inoculations of booster shots but not planning renewed curbs. Australia warned it could be hit with its worst Covid-19 outbreak over the next few weeks fuelled by the BA.4/5 Omicron variants. Authorities said  “millions” of new infections could be expected, but ruled out any tough restrictions to contain the spread.
“We’ve moved beyond that ... we’re not in the era of lockdowns and those sorts of things,” Federal Health Minister Mark Butler told radio station 2GB on Thursday, even as he urged Australians to consider working from home again. Australian hospital admissions are already hovering near levels seen in the last major Omicron outbreak earlier this year with its health system also under pressure from high Covid and influenza numbers. While cases in Thailand have trended down, infections in Indonesia have picked up, reaching the highest since March.
New infections and hospitalisations in the Philippines remain low, but the government has warned case numbers could rise at least 20-fold by the end of the month.

6,Emirates snubs Heathrow over call to cut capacity,DUBAI: Emirates airline said on Thursday it had rejected demands by London’s Heathrow Airport to cut capacity...,"DUBAI: Emirates airline said on Thursday it had rejected demands by London’s Heathrow Airport to cut capacity despite being threatened with legal action, and intended to continue operating its six daily flights to Britain’s busiest airport.
Heathrow this week asked airlines to stop selling some tickets for summer flights, limiting the number of passengers flying from the hub to 100,000 a day to ease pressure on operations that have been unable to keep up with demand.
Emirates, owned by the government of Dubai, said Heathrow had given the airline 36 hours from Wednesday to reduce capacity on its six daily flights, which are operated with the Airbus A380 superjumbo.
“Their communications not only dictated the specific flights on which we should throw out paying passengers, but also threatened legal action for non-compliance,” the airline said. “Until further notice, Emirates plans to operate as scheduled to and from (Heathrow),” it said in the statement.

Temperatures soared in Greece, Spain and Portugal, while the heatwave was expected to continue in Britain and France into next week. It is the second heatwave to hit the region in a matter of weeks, as scientists say they are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change.
Southern Spain was bracing for temperatures to rise again Thursday as the stifling heat continued. “For Thursday, we expect it to be the hottest day of this heatwave,” said Spain’s state meteorological agency AEMET.
The valleys around three major rivers — the Guadiana, Guadalquivir and Tagus — will experience temperatures of 44 Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) to 45 Celsius, it said.
The health ministry told people to drink plenty of fluids, wear light clothes and stay in the shade or air-conditioning. The city of Almonte in the southern region of Andalusia saw the mercury hit 45.6 degrees Celsius at 5:30pm on Wednesday.
Several other southern cities such as Seville and Cordoba recorded temperatures above 44C.
‘Major’ fires
A fire in Spain which started in the eastern region of Extremadura on Monday has so far ravaged at least 4,000 hectares of land, local officials said. Between January 1 and July 3, more than 70,300 hectares of forest went up in smoke in Spain, the government said — almost double the average of the past 10 years.
Italy, Croatia, France and Portugal all reported forest fires linked to the heat this week. In Greece, a helicopter helping to fight a forest fire on the island of Samos on Wednesday crashed into the Aegean Sea, killing two crew members, the coastguard said Thursday.
In Portugal, over 2,000 firefighters were battling dozens of wildfires across Portugal, including four deemed  “major”.
One person died in a forest blaze, authorities said Wednesday, after a body was found in a burned area in the northern region of Aveiro. Around 60 others have been injured, some 860 people evacuated and roughly 60 homes destroyed or damaged.
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa warned that Thursday would be the  “most serious” day of the heat wave because temperatures were expected to rise and winds were stronger. “Today is the day where we have to be the most careful,” he said.

8,UK gallery unearths hidden self-portrait by Van Gogh,EDINBURGH: A gallery in Scotland said on Thursday it was  “thrilled” to announce the discovery of a previously...,"EDINBURGH: A gallery in Scotland said on Thursday it was  “thrilled” to announce the discovery of a previously unknown self-portrait of Vincent Van Gogh, with his ear intact, hidden behind another painting.
The portrait was found on the back of the canvas of  “Head of a Peasant Woman”, an 1885 work by the Dutch post-Impressionist, covered by layers of glue and cardboard.
It shows a bearded sitter in a brimmed hat with a neckerchief tied loosely at the neck. It was completed before Van Gogh cut off his left ear in 1888.
Visitors to the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh will be able to see it at a forthcoming exhibition, as an X-ray image through a specially designed lightbox.
Longer term, curators are working on safely extracting it from the overlaying canvas without damaging the paintings. Lesley Stevenson, senior paintings conservator at the National Galleries, said they were  “thrilled to bits” at the find.
“When we saw the X-ray for the first time of course we were hugely excited,” she said. “This is a significant discovery because it adds to what we already know about Van Gogh’s life.
“There is lots to think about with regards to the next steps, but for us it is another little nugget to get us a little bit closer to an incredible artist.”
Curators believe the painting, which was only sold after his 1890 death by suicide, is one of a series of experimental self-portraits. Five similar works are displayed at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, painted before he moved to Paris in 1886.
Van Gogh, who was unknown and penniless when he died, often painted on both sides of a canvas in order to save money.

9,"Italian premier quits after ally ditches govt, but president asks him to stay on",He had resigned after a party in his ruling coalition did not take part in a confidence vote in the government.,"ROME: The Italian head of state rejected the resignation of Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Thursday and asked him to address parliament to get a clear picture of the political situation. 
Draghi had tendered his resignation after the 5-Star Movement, a party in his ruling coalition, did not take part in a confidence vote in the government.
The confidence vote had become a focal point for tensions within Draghi’s government as its parties prepare to fight each other in a national election due by early 2023.
The decision by the 5-Star party to boycott the confidence vote on Thursday triggered the sequence of events that prompted the 74-year-old Draghi to say he would quit.
Draghi had said he would not want to lead a government without 5-Star, which emerged as the largest party in the previous election in 2018 but has since suffered defections and a loss of public support. Italy has not had an autumn election since World War Two as that is normally when the budget is drawn up and approved by parliament.
The risks of a collapse of a Draghi government rippled through financial markets on Thursday where Italian bond yields rose sharply, indicating investors demanding a higher premium to hold its debt, and shares fell to their lowest levels since late 2020. The turmoil comes at a challenging time for Italy, the third largest economy in the euro zone, where borrowing costs have risen sharply as the ECB starts tightening its monetary policy.
The ECB is working on a new tool to contain divergence between German borrowing costs and those of highly indebted member states such as Italy.
Draghi, Italy’s sixth prime minister in the last decade, had been seen as providing reassurance that Italy would respect any conditions attached to the new mechanism but his departure would create fresh uncertainty.

10,US doctor under investigation after abortion for child rape victim,"A trigger law banning all abortions after six weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest, came into force in Ohio last month.","WASHINGTON: Authorities in Indiana said they are investigating a gynecologist who performed an abortion on a 10-year-old girl who had been raped — a flashpoint case in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the federal right to end a pregnancy.
Caitlin Bernard said earlier this month that she had treated the girl in Indianapolis after being contacted by a colleague in neighboring Ohio.
A trigger law banning all abortions after six weeks, with no exceptions for rape or incest, came into force in Ohio last month after the nation’s high court ended decades of constitutional protection for the right to end a pregnancy.
The girl, who was raped in May by a man who was arrested on Tuesday, was past the six-week cut-off. To get an abortion, she traveled to Indiana, where the procedure is legal up until 21 weeks. But authorities in the mainly Republican state oppose abortion and are now considering banning the procedure.
Indiana attorney general Todd Rokita criticised Bernard on Wednesday evening, accusing her of not alerting the authorities to the case of the girl, as state law requires in case of sex crimes involving minors.
“We have this abortion activist acting as a doctor with a history of failing to report,” Rokita said on Fox News.
“So we’re gathering the information. We’re gathering the evidence as we speak and we’re going to fight this to the end, including looking at her licensure, if she failed to report,” he added. President Joe Biden spoke of the Ohio rape victim during a July 8 ceremony at which he signed reproductive right protections into law and urged Congress to codify Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that established the nationwide right to abortion.

11,US vows to use all means to stop Iran nuclear bomb in Israel pact,Declaration commits the United States to  “never to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon”.,"JERUSALEM: The US and Israel signed a new security pact on Thursday reinforcing their common front against Iran, as President Joe Biden pledged to use  “all” American power to stop the Islamic republic from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The declaration was inked by Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid and Biden, who was making his first trip to the Middle East as president.
It commits the United States to  “never to allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon”, stating that it  “is prepared to use all elements of its national power to ensure that outcome”.
A landmark deal that imposed curbs on Iran’s suspect nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief was torpedoed in 2018 by former US president Donald Trump. Efforts to revive the accord have been stalled since March.
Asked on Thursday how long the US was prepared to give those efforts, Biden said  “we’re not going to wait forever” for a response from the Islamic republic.
A day after Israeli officials presented Biden with their latest military hardware, the president said the two countries would co-operate on developing  “high-energy laser weapon systems”.
Israel, which has the Middle East’s sole but undeclared nuclear arsenal, is staunchly opposed to the deal with Iran, which has always denied seeking the bomb.
Lapid warned  “words” and  “diplomacy” were not enough to thwart Iran’s alleged nuclear ambitions.
“The only thing that will stop Iran is knowing that if they continue to develop their nuclear programme the free world will use force,” he said. Iran’s ultra-conservative President Ebrahim Raisi warned the US and its allies that his country  “will not accept any crisis or insecurity in the region”.
“Any mistake made in this region will be met with a harsh and regrettable resp­onse,” Raisi said in televised remarks. Biden touched down in Israel on Wednesday, his 10th visit to the Jewish state since 1973, when he came as a newly elected senator.
He held talks with Israeli President Isaac Herzog later on Thursday and was due to meet an old acquaintance, opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu.
On Friday the US president will travel to the occupied West Bank to meet Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas, before Air Force Once makes the first publicly acknowledged direct flight from Israel to Saudi Arabia.
Biden said the journey itself  “represents important progress”, following Israel launching diplomatic ties in 2020 with Riyadh’s Gulf neighbours the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. “Israel’s integration in the region, Israel’s peace with its neighbours, these are essential goals,” Biden said.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will be a top priority for the president’s meetings with Arab leaders, with volatile oil prices due to be the focus of talks with Saudi officials in particular.
The president will seek to persuade Saudi Arabia to pump more oil in order to drive down prices, which have fuelled US inflation to the highest levels in decades.
On Thursday, Biden reaffirmed Washington’s policy of pressing for  “a two-state solution for two people, both of whom have deep and ancient roots in this land, living side by side in peace and security.” But he made it clear he has no plans to reverse Trump’s controversial decision to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.
