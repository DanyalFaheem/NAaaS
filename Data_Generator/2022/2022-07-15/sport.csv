Netherlands comfortably beat Uganda in the same section to win the group while Papua New Guinea pipped Hong Kong and Uganda on net run rates to finish runners-up and survive.
In the semi-finals on Friday in southern city Bulawayo, the Dutch will face Group A runners-up the United States while Papua New Guinea take on Group A winners Zimbabwe.
The semi-final winners will join 14 other teams, including hosts and defending champions Australia, at the 2022 T20 World Cup from Oct 16.
“It was a dream come true to reach the last T20 World Cup and we hope to beat Zimbabwe and go to Australia,” said Papua New Guinea captain Assad Vala.
“All of us enjoyed the wonderful experience of playing in the UAE and Oman last year and we want to enjoy that experience again.”
After losing their first two group matches, Hong Kong snatched a two-wicket victory over Papua New Guinea thanks to a single from Shahid Wasif off the final ball of the last over.
Papua New Guinea, seeking a second successive T20 World Cup appearance, posted 185-7 in 20 overs with veteran Tony Ura striking 83 off just 33 balls, including eight sixes and four fours.
Charles Amini (37) and Lega Siaka (21) were the best of the other Papua New Guinean batsmen while Ehsan Khan (3-20) was the most successful Hong Kong bowler.
A tense Hong Kong run chase saw them reach 179-7 with one over remaining and needing seven more runs to snatch victory.
A single and a four from Scott McKechnie and a bye levelled the scores with three balls remaining, but the next two deliveries yielded no further runs.
Wasif needed one run to win the match and that is what he achieved, knocking a delivery from Semo Kamea to midwicket.
But losers Papua New Guinea scraped into the semi-finals with a -0.419 net run rate, ahead of Hong Kong (-0.898) and Uganda (-1.996).
Uganda began the final round of group matches in second spot, but proved no match for the Netherlands and lost by 97 runs.
A 121-run third-wicket partnership between Tom Cooper (81) and Max O’Dowd (73) helped the Dutch post 187-3 in their alloted overs.
The Ugandan reply began disastrously and they were 7-4 after just 2.3 overs before crawling to 90-9 with Riazat Ali Shah (19) top scoring. Fred Klaassen (5-19) was the Dutch destroyer in chief.
In Group A, Zimbabwe (185-6) maintained a perfect record by beating the USA (139-8) by 46 runs in a match to decide first place. Sikandar Raza was the Zimbabwe batting star, with his 82 off 40 balls including five sixes and seven fours, while Sean Williams (37) and Regis Chakabva (31) were also in good form.
USA opener Steven Taylor struck a 46 laced with a six and five fours, taking his total from three group matches to 205 runs. Wellington Masakadza, who captured four wickets for 11 runs in three overs, was the most successful Zimbabwean bowler.
A 44-run knock by Nick Greenwood earned Jersey, a tiny island between England and France, a 13-run victory over Singapore and third place.

1,Kohli absent from India squad for West Indies T20s,"Former captain Kohli, 33, has been going through a prolonged lean patch and has not hit a century since 2019.","NEW DELHI: India’s out-of-form star batter Virat Kohli was missing from the 18-member squad announced by selectors Thursday for the upcoming five-match Twenty20 series in the West Indies.
Former captain Kohli, 33, has been going through a prolonged lean patch and has not hit a century since 2019, with his future now a matter of intense public debate in his cricket-obsessed country.
The Indian cricket board (BCCI), which rarely explains team selection, did not specify if Kohli had finally been dropped or was merely being rested over injury concerns ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia.
With a number of in-form batter pushing for a top order berth, Kohli’s place in the Twenty20 squad has been questioned, especially ahead of this year’s World Cup in Australia.
Former coach Ravi Shastri has advised Kohli to take a break from the game and return rejuvenated.
BCCI president Sourav Ganguly has backed the 33-year-old to regain his form. 
“He himself knows by his own standards it has not been good and I see him coming back and doing well,” Ganguly told Reuters partner ANI. 
“But he has got to find his way and become successful, which he has been for the last 12-13 years or more and only Virat Kohli can do that.”
Seamer Jasprit Bumrah, currently the top-ranked ODI bowler, has also been rested considering the workload of India’s all-format pace spearhead.
Ace off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin returned to the T20 format, as will opener KL Rahul and left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav if they prove their fitness to confirm their spots.
India’s all-format captain Rohit Sharma will lead the pace-heavy squad with several breakthrough stars from the Indian Premier League T20 tournament.
The five matches will be played at three venues in Trinidad, St Kitts and Lauderhill in the US state of Florida.
Squad: Rohit Sharma (captain), Ishan Kishan, KL Rahul, Suryakumar Yadav, Deepak Hooda, Shreyas Iyer, Dinesh Karthik, Rishabh Pant (wicket-keeper), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravi Bishnoi, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Avesh Khan, Harshal Patel, Arshdeep Singh.

2,Omanyala optimistic of racing at worlds despite late visa,NAIROBI: Africa’s fastest man Ferdinand Omanyala said he is  “positive” that he will compete at the World...,"NAIROBI: Africa’s fastest man Ferdinand Omanyala said he is  “positive” that he will compete at the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, despite receiving his visa to travel to the United States less than 24 hours before the event.
Omanyala, who is on the entry list for the 100 metres, initially announced that he would not take part because of a delay in getting a visa.
“Onto the next flight to Oregon,” Omanyala, who will travel from Nairobi, said on Twitter.  “Am positive that I will compete.”  A spokesperson for Omanyala told Reuters that the Kenyan sprinter will arrive about three hours before his 100m heat on Friday, which is around 1900 local time in Eugene.
The spokesperson said that the delay in getting the visa was likely due to the significant backlog of cases resulting from closures due to Covid-19.
“Visa challenges are faced by all Kenyans and people daily, in this case I was no different,” Omanyala added.
The BBC reported that Athletics Kenya executive member Barnabas Korir is holding talks with World Athletics about the possibility of staging a solo heat if Omanyala does not arrive on time.
Omanyala set the African men’s 100 metres record after clocking a time of 9.77 seconds at the Kip Keino Classic meeting in Nairobi in September 2021.
The 26-year-old won the African 100m title last month and was the first Kenyan to qualify for the Olympic 100m semi-finals in Tokyo last year.
He said he will also be taking part at the Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Birmingham from July 28.

3,ICC bans Bangladesh pacer Shohidul for failing dope test,DHAKA: The International Cricket Council on Thursday announced a 10-month ban on Bangladesh pace bowler Shohidul...,"DHAKA: The International Cricket Council on Thursday announced a 10-month ban on Bangladesh pace bowler Shohidul Islam from all cricketing activities after he failed a dope test conducted in March.
The 27-year-old pacer, who has appeared in one Twenty20 international against Pakistan in November and was part of the Test and T20 squads for Bangladesh’s ongoing West Indies tour, provided a urine sample as part of the ICC’s out-of-competition testing programme in Dhaka on March 4.
A subsequent test found the sample contained clomifene, a prohibited substance both in-competition and out-of-competition by the World Anti-Doping Agency, the ICC said in a statement.
Shohidul admitted the violation and accepted a 10-month suspension, which takes effect from May 28, the date of his acceptance of a voluntary provisional suspension.
He will remain suspended until March 28, 2023.
The ICC said it accepted Shohidul had demonstrated no significant fault or negligence as the prohibited substance was found in a medicine he had been legitimately prescribed for therapeutic reasons.
“Shohidul was able to satisfy the ICC that he had no intention to enhance his sporting performance by using prohibited substances,” the sport’s governing body said.
The pacer accepted that he had failed to satisfy the high levels of personal responsibility incumbent upon him as an international cricketer under the anti-doping rules, the ICC added.
Shohidul is the second Bangladeshi cricketer to face a doping ban in recent years.
In 2020, the Bangladesh Cricket Board slapped a two-year ban on promising pacer Kazi Anik Islam, the country’s leading wicket-taker in the 2018 Under-19 World Cup, after he tested positive for methamphetamine during a local first-class match.

6,Dembele ends speculation by sticking with Barcelona,"BARCELONA: French international winger Ousmane Dembele, whose contract with  Barcelona expired last month, ended six...","BARCELONA: French international winger Ousmane Dembele, whose contract with  Barcelona expired last month, ended six months of speculation by agreeing  to ‘rejoin’ the Catalan side, the club announced on Thursday. 
“Staying at Barca was always my first choice,” Dembele said on the  pitch at Barcelona’s training ground as he signed his two-year contract  extension until June 2024. 
The signing brings an end to a six-month soap opera about where the 25-year-old would be playing his football next season. 
“It’s been a long time coming, but now everyone is happy,” said Dembele. 
“I’m very happy, Barcelona has been my dream club since I was a  child. I can’t wait for the season to start so I can give it my all.”  Dembele joined Barcelona in 2017 from Borussia Dortmund, but suffered a  string of serious hamstring injuries. 
“The first three years were not easy with injuries, but now I feel  good with the team and the city and I have the confidence of everyone,”  he said. 
Even though he scored only one league goal last season, the Catalans  were keen to keep a player who seemed revitalised following the  appointment of Xavi Hernandez as coach, but talks appeared to break  down. 
In January, Xavi warned Dembele that he had to  “extend” his  contract or  “leave” the club but the French World Cup winner warned he  would not  “give in to blackmail”. 
Last month, Sports daily Marca described the negotiations as a  “dialogue between the deaf”. 
Paris St-Germain were strongly linked with a move to bring the former Rennes star back to France. 
According to the press, Dembele agreed to lower his salary  expectations to fit in with a club that remains in economic  difficulties. 
Barca, meanwhile, were able to move closer to his wage demands  thanks to the 207.5 million euro sale of 10 per cent of  its audiovisual rights to the American company Sixth Street. The club  is, moreover, about to sell another 15 per cent for 330 million euros. 
With the arrivals of Franck Kessie, Andreas Christensen and  Raphinha, the resolution of the Dembele affair marks the fourth good  catch for the Catalans this summer. 
“My dream is to win the Champions League this year,” said Dembele.   “I’m going to work hard on the pitch and hopefully it will be a great  year for me and for Barca.

7,Young takes clubhouse lead as McIlroy starts strongly,ST ANDREWS: Cameron Young of the United States stormed into the lead with an eight-under-par 64 in the first round ...,"ST ANDREWS: Cameron Young of the United States stormed into the lead with an eight-under-par 64 in the first round of the 150th British Open at St Andrews on Thursday but Rory McIlroy sat just two strokes behind after an impressive start to his bid for the Claret Jug. 
Young, the 25-year-old American, produced a flawless round featuring no bogeys and eight birdies. 
That gave him a two-shot lead in the clubhouse from McIlroy, whose 66 included three straight birdies between the fifth and seventh holes. 
Young, ranked 32nd in the world, finished tied third in this year’s PGA Championship and has now put himself in a strong position to be a contender into the weekend. 
“I think any time you’re around the lead in a major championship or any PGA Tour event, frankly, you get more and more comfortable every time,” said Young, who first played the Old Course with his parents aged 13. “Whether I’m leading by three or one or four back after today, I’ll sleep just fine.” 
McIlroy was the favourite for the Claret Jug coming into the week and the Northern Irishman, who won the Open in 2014, lived up to his billing in the opening round. 
His 66, featuring just one dropped shot at the par-four 13th hole, matched his score in the opening round on his way to victory at Hoylake eight years ago. 
“I need to go out tomorrow and back up what I just did today. I think that’s important to do,” said the 33-year-old, who will not tee off until mid-afternoon on Friday. “But again, this golf course isn’t going to change that much, I don’t think, between today and tomorrow in terms of conditions.” 
Australia’s Cameron Smith sat in third place in the clubhouse after an opening 67. 
Smith, winner of The Players Championship in March, drained a right-to-left, 55-foot birdie putt at the par-4 second to jump-start his round. He finished with six birdies and one bogey. 
“I think it’s nice to get off to a hot start any week, really,” Smith said. “But these majors, I think the tougher the course gets, especially around here, how it’s going to get really firm and really fast, it’s almost going to be like holding on, I think, on the weekend.” 
A large group at three-under also included Xander Schauffele, Bryson DeChambeau and Ian Poulter of England. World number one Scottie Scheffler was 3 under through eight holes. 
A group at 68 included English amateur Barclay Brown, fellow Englishman Lee Westwood, Kurt Kitayama, Australia’s Brad Kennedy and Norway’s Viktor Hovland. Paul Casey of England was four-under through eight holes. 
BAD START FOR WOODS
Tiger Woods, twice an Open champion at St Andrews, was among the leading names who did not go out until the afternoon, and the 46-year-old endured a disastrous start. 
He sent his approach to the first green into the Swilcan Burn and ending up with a double-bogey six. More dropped shots followed at the third and fourth. 
The landmark staging of the world’s oldest golf tournament has not been able to escape the controversy caused by the breakaway Saudi-backed LIV tour. 
England’s Ian Poulter, one of 24 players in this week’s line-up who agreed to join the LIV series, was booed on the first tee as he went out early in the morning. 
After being jeered by the galleries, he hit his tee shot way left and almost finished out of bounds on the far side of the 18th fairway. 
However, he recovered to shoot a 69 in a round that included a mammoth eagle putt at the par-four ninth, and Poulter insisted he did not hear any jeers. 
“I actually thought I had a great reception on the first tee, to be honest. All I heard was clapping,” said Poulter. 
Former Open champion Phil Mickelson, Brooks Koepka, Dustin Johnson, Sergio Garcia and Westwood are also among the LIV series members at St Andrews. 
Ernie Els used four birdies between the eighth and 12th holes to get to five-under. But after bogeying the 16th, his drive at 17th, the Road Hole, found the Old Course Hotel out of bounds. The two-time Open champion from South Africa made double bogey and wrapped up a two-under 70. 
Defending champion Collin Morikawa opened with an even-par 72, tied with a group that also included Mickelson (three birdies, three bogeys). 
England’s former US Open champion Justin Rose withdrew just before his scheduled tee-time due to a back injury, with his place taken by Rikuya Hoshino of Japan. 
The course is hosting the championship for the 30th time, and the Open is expecting record attendances for the week of 290,000, meaning packed galleries for the first championship since the end of pandemic-related restrictions.

8,POA vows to accommodate athletes as PSB slashes contingent for Islamic Games,The PSB has reduced the Pakistan contingent from 122 to 76 for next month’s Islamic Solidarity Games in Turkey.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Sports Board is continuing with its policy of sending athletes with medal-winning chances to international events.
The PSB on Thursday reduced the Pakistan contingent from 122 to 76 for next month’s Islamic Solidarity Games in Turkey in a similar move to one earlier this month when the contingent for the Commonwealth Games was cut to 74 from 104.
However, the Pakistan Olympic Association vowed that it try to accommodate and cover the costs of all the athletes to participate in the events — an issue which will come under discussion during its executive body meeting here on Saturday.
The Commonwealth Games are scheduled to be held in Birmingham, England from July 28 to Aug 8 and will be immediately followed by the Islamic Solidarity Games in Konya, Turkey from Aug 9 to 18.
“The cases of athletes whose accreditations had been made for both the Games will be under consideration during the executive body meeting on Saturday,” POA secretary Khalid Mahmood told Dawn on Thursday.
“We will try to accommodate all the athletes as it doesn’t look nice if they don’t participate even after their accreditations have been made. The responsibility of the travelling officials will fall on the shoulders of the respective national sports federations.”
PSB director general retired Col Asif Zaman reiterated the government’s policy to only fund those athletes who have chances to win medals.“Pakistan has chances to win medals in volleyball, wrestling and weightlifting so they are intact,” Asif told Dawn on Thursday. 
Hockey isn’t part of the Islamic Games while PSB will fund participants in athletics, judo, karate, shooting, swimming and taekwondo at the event. The PSB has approved a contingent of 53 athletes, 13 coaches and team officials, seven contingent officials and three dignitaries.
Swimmers have been included despite Pakistan’s track record in the sport being rather unimpressive.
The PSB has come under criticism for omitting the five-member badminton squad for the Commonwealth Games on the pretext of performance and Asif defended that move, saying “they had no chance for medals”.
Khalid, however, countered saying that players “could learn a lot through participation in international events and that experience would be useful for the future”.
The PSB has held a 15-day training camp for the athletes but Asif said that training camps for medal hopes had been underway for the last year.
“But longer training camps will be held for the South Asian Games and the Asian Games which are expected to be held next year,” he concluded.

9,Former Pakistan captain Aamir says big bucks ‘good for cricket’,"""It’s good that players are getting good money nowadays,"" he says.","GALLE: Former Pakistan captain and match-fixing witness Aamir Sohail welcomes the deluge of legitimate money into cricket that has seen players make millions in tournaments, saying it reduces temptation for corruption.
Sohail’s playing heyday came between 1990 and 2000, far too early to benefit from the T20 revolution begun by the Indian Premier League.
But the 55-year-old, who was a whistleblower — a term he dislikes — in Pakistan’s 1990s match-fixing controversy, told AFP the big bucks are good for the sport. 
“It’s good that players are getting good money nowadays,” said Sohail, who played 47 Tests and 156 One-day Internationals. 
“Temptations are there but of late we haven’t had any news of wrongdoing. 
“So if things are under control and cricketers are getting legitimate money, I think that’s very good for the game.” 
Former Pakistan captain Salim Malik was banned for life for match-fixing and pace bowler Ata-ur-Rehman for perjury after the country’s cricket board set up a judicial commission to investigate revelations by several players, including Sohail, of match-fixing.
Sohail, who is in Sri Lanka as a TV commentator and will call the two Tests starting Saturday involving Pakistan, added current players should not be complaining about too much cricket. 
“The contemporary cricketer, if he is aspiring to play top level of the game then he should be prepared for its demands,” said Sohail, a left-handed opener who was key in Pakistan’s 1992 50-over World Cup triumph. 
“Your level of fitness and the hunger should match up to the level of playing for your country.” 
He lauded Pakistan skipper Babar Azam for showing the way to the countries new generation with his work ethic and prolific run-scoring. 
“Babar has proved himself with his performance,” said Sohail. 
“Now he has to live up to those expectations that he has set from his batting and keep on improving.” 
The 27-year-old Babar has an average of over 45 in 40 Tests and recently hit 196 in the second Australia Test, which ended in a draw. Pakistan lost the series 1-0.
NEW TRICKS WITH OLD BALL
Sohail rates the current Pakistan Test team as full of talent but said the fast bowlers need to develop new methods to make the old ball more effective when reverse swing is not available. 
“There is definitely room for improvement in Test cricket. We used to rattle opposition batting with our reverse swing in the middle overs,” Sohail said.
Pakistan have been pioneers of reversing the ball, with former speedsters Sarfraz Nawaz, Imran Khan, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis rattling the opposition batters.
New Covid-19 rules prohibit the use of saliva to maintain the old ball — a practice that aids reverse swing — and pace bowlers including India’s Jasprit Bumrah believe sweat is not as effective.
But Sohail, also a left-arm spinner during his playing days, insists it’s not saliva but the changed nature of pitches that has resulted in reverse swing becoming ineffective at times — and urged the quicks to make adjustments. 
“They are good with the new ball, good in the middle overs if it’s reversing but when it’s not reversing then they haven’t got anything new,” he said. 
“If our fast bowlers learn the art of working with the old ball then our team will go a long way with the kind of talent we have.”

The returning quartet will further strengthen the group which bounced back to hammer Australia after losing the first Test on a vicious turner. 
Both matches were played in Galle, where Dimuth Karunaratne’s Sri Lanka will be looking to build on their winning momentum in a likely spin battle in the opening Test starting Saturday. 
Debutant left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya, who returned a match haul of 12 wickets to hand Australia a thumping defeat by an innings and 39 runs in the final match, has also been picked for the Pakistan games. 
Mystery spinner Maheesh Theekshana and all-rounder Kamindu Mendis also got a first Test cap in the previous match after the team suffered a Covid outbreak and both will be available against Babar Azam’s Pakistan.
Kamindu also made a mark in the series-levelling win with his gritty 61 in a 133-run stand with Dinesh Chandimal, who hit his maiden Test double century. 
Sri Lankan captain Karunaratne admitted Pakistan will be tougher opposition than Australia in the two Tests but believed playing in Galle for the third straight time will be an advantage for the hosts. 
“Pakistan is a strong side. (But) playing three games in Galle is good for a team. We know how conditions are in the last few games,” said Karunaratne. “Pakistan don’t have that opportunity. Big advantage for us. We need to turn that in our favour.”
The second Test will be played in Colombo from July 24. 
Sri Lanka squad: Dimuth Karunaratne (captain), Pathum Nissanka, Oshada Fernando, Angelo Mathews, Kusal Mendis, Dhananjaya de Silva, Kamindu Mendis, Niroshan Dickwella (wicket-keeper), Dinesh Chandimal (wicket-keeper), Ramesh Mendis, Maheesh Theekshana, Kasun Rajitha, Vishwa Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Dilshan Madushanka, Prabath Jayasuriya, Dunith Wellalage, Jeffrey Vandersay.

A daredevil descent lit the fuse for the 22-year-old’s win while an explosive acceleration on the final ascent of the Alpe d’Huez finished the job.
Jonas Vingegaard maintained his overall lead with defending champion Tadej Pogacar on his wheel.
South African Louis Meintjes was second in the stage, with former four time winner Chris Froome third.
They were part of an escape group that Pidcock first caught with a breath-taking descent and then dropped on the last Alpine climb of this 109th edition of the Tour.
Pidcock is the Olympic mountain-bike champion and the cyclo-cross world champion and the beauty and bravery of his descent of the Col du Telegraph set him apart from the other riders.
“On the descent people did not want to risk chasing me,” Pidcock who climbed to eighth with his feat, said at the finish line. “My first stage win on my first tour. Not bad. Even if I get dropped every day now I don’t care.”
A day after his triumph on the Col du Granon, Danish Jumbo rider Vingegaard, chaperoned by team-mates held off a blistering attack from Pogacar, who is second in the overall. Ineos leader Geraint Thomas followed them over the line and climbs to third overall.

12,ECB security team to visit Pakistan next week,"Sources say officials will assess venues in Lahore, Karachi, Multan and Rawalpindi.","KARACHI: A security delegation of the England and Wales Cricket Board will visit Pakistan next week to inspect the potential venues for the team’s tour later this year.
The delegation will comprise security officials of the ECB and a representative of the Professional Cricketer’s Association — England’s players’ body.
According to sources, the officials will assess venues in Lahore, Karachi, Multan and Rawalpindi for Pakistan’s seven-match Twenty20 International series and three-match Test series against England scheduled for September and November-December respectively.
During its visit, the security delegation will meet representatives of the cities’ local administration while also carrying out inspection of the hotels — where the teams will potentially stay during the tours — and assess the route to the stadiums.
Since the return of Test cricket to Pakistan in 2019 after a 10-year gap, only Karachi, Rawalpindi and Lahore have hosted five-day games. 
However, Dawn understands that Multan is in consideration for one of the 10 matches during England’s visit, which, if goes ahead, will take place after nearly 17 years.
The Multan Cricket Stadium hosted Pakistan’s three-match One-day International series against the West Indies in June and witnessed full-houses throughout the series.
England were scheduled to visit Pakistan for five T20s last year, but the ECB pulled out of the tour citing players’ mental well-being issues. The withdrawal came days after New Zealand abruptly aborted their tour fearing “security threats”.

13,Chahal shines as India dismiss England for 246,LONDON: Yuzvendra Chahal ripped through England’s middle-order as the Indian attack dominated again to bowl out ...,"LONDON: Yuzvendra Chahal ripped through England’s middle-order as the Indian attack dominated again to bowl out the home side for 246 inside 50 overs in the second One-day International of their three-match series at Lord’s on Thursday. 
Two days after pace proved England’s undoing during a 10-wicket thrashing in the first of a three-match series at the Oval, leg-spinner Chahal was their tormentor-in-chief on the other side of London’s River Thames. 
He finished with 4-47 from his maximum 10 overs, including a burst of 3-18 in 16 balls that accounted for key batsmen Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root and Ben Stokes as England slumped from 72-1 to 87-4. 
England, on the third anniversary of their dramatic World Cup final victory at Lord’s, were indebted to two players who didn’t feature in that match — Moeen Ali and David Willey — for getting past 200. 
The left-handers put on 62 in 13 overs after coming together at 148-6 after India captain Rohit Sharma won the toss and opted to field first on a green-tinged pitch. 
Moeen top-scored with 47 while Willey, who should have been out for one and was dropped again on 23, made 41. 
England were unchanged despite a batting collapse on Tuesday that was followed by a mauling for their attack. 
India recalled Virat Kohli, who missed the Oval match with a groin problem, on a day where the 33-year-old star batsman — without an international hundred since 2019 — was left out of the squad for an upcoming Twenty20 series in the West Indies. 
England collapsed to 26-5 inside eight overs at the Oval during a match where India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah took a career-best 6-19. 
But they avoided similar embarrassment at Lord’s. 
Jason Roy heaved Mohammed Shami over deep midwicket for six before, on 23, he flicked first-change Hardik Pandya straight to deep square leg. 
Fellow opener Jonny Bairstow, one of five England survivors from the World Cup final in Thursday’s team along with Roy, Root, Stokes and now captain Jos Buttler, looked in good touch. 
But he was bowled for a run-a-ball trying to slog sweep Chahal, who then had Root plumb lbw for 11 when the world’s top-ranked Test batsman, missed a sweep. 
Dangerman Buttler, who has lost three of his four games since succeeding retired World Cup-winning skipper Eoin Morgan as England’s white-ball captain, managed just four before he was bowled by a Shami inswinger to leave England reeling at 87-4 Stokes, playing one reverse sweep too many, was lbw to Chahal for 21. 
Liam Livingstone took the attack to Pandya but the bowler got his revenge when the Lancastrian holed out in the deep after an entertaining run-a-ball 33. 
Moeen, who pulled Prasidh Krishna for a huge six, repaired some of the damage before he holed out off Chahal with Willey, reprieved on one when Krishna dropped a simple chance at fine leg, slogging a catch in the deep off Bumrah.

14,Bangladesh sweep to ODI series win as WI batting wilts,PROVIDENCE: Bangladesh’s array of spin bowling talent again proved too much for the West Indies batting line-up to...,"PROVIDENCE: Bangladesh’s array of spin bowling talent again proved too much for the West Indies batting line-up to handle with the visitors completing a comprehensive series-clinching nine-wicket victory in the second One-day International of a three-match series at the Guyana National Stadium on Wednesday.
Beaten by six wickets in the first match at the same venue on Sunday, the home batters were even more inept in being dismissed for 108 off 35 overs.
Having been swept 2-0 in both the preceding Test and T20 series, the tourists extended the ODI dominance of their present foes in reaching the modest target with almost 30 overs to spare.
It was their 10th consecutive ODI victory over the West Indies and also ensures they remain unbeaten in ODI series against the Caribbean side since they lost the corresponding duel in the region in 2014.
Off-spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz led the rout with figures of four for 29 while left-arm slow bowler Nasum Ahmed claimed three for 19 and the Man of the Match award as the home side’s batters once again appeared all at sea on a pitch which again offered considerable assistance to the spinners.
Tamim Iqbal then led the comfortable pursuit of such a modest target, sealing victory and reaching a 53rd ODI half-century with his seventh boundary. 
“We really wanted to win this series very badly after losing in the Tests and T20 Internationals,” said Tamim in reflecting on a performance which gave Bangladesh at fifth straight ODI series win. 
“We know this is the format we are strongest in and it was important to show that confidence after the earlier disappointments.” 
Following their struggles in the rain-affected first match, West Indies tried to build a more stable platform after predictably being put in to bat.
However the dismissal of Kyle Mayers by the spin of Mosaddek Hossain after an opening stand of 27 in the 11th over triggered the slide which saw them crashing to 86 for nine in the 31st over.
An unbeaten 25 by all-rounder Keemo Paul and a last-wicket stand of 22 with fellow-Guyanese Gudakesh Motie at least took the West Indies past the 100-run mark.
Motie was the lone-wicket taker in the Bangladesh reply, dismissing Najmul Hossain Shanto for 20 to end an opening stand of 48 with Tamim.
Liton Das’ unbeaten 32 alongside his skipper ensured the romp to victory was completed in double-quick time. 
“We didn’t show up as a batting unit today,” was the frank assessment of West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran, who fell to Nasum for a first-ball duck. 
“It is quite frustrating our batting efforts of late in ODI cricket and we need to come together quickly to fix this situation.”
