1,MQM parliamentarians court arrest over Hesco official’s attitude,HYDERABAD: Two parliamentarians of Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan from Hyderabad went to senior superintendent of...,"HYDERABAD: Two parliamentarians of Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan from Hyderabad went to senior superintendent of police’s office on Thursday to court arrest in protest against application for registration of FIR against the party’s MPA filed by an officer of the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company. Police, however, did not make any arrests.
MPA Nasir Qureshi, flanked by MNA Salahuddin, said at a hurriedly-called news conference at local press club that a Hesco executive engineer (XEN) sought registration of the FIR against MPA Nasir Qureshi because Hesco chief executive officer was annoyed with him for raising issues of power breakdowns in Sindh Assembly. 
He said that he had met Hesco CEO a day before Eidul Azha to complain about a faulty transformer, which had been re-installed in his area, Phuleli, without being repaired, subjecting a large population to live without power supply for three days. Currently, around 30 transformers remained out of order in Phuleli and Paretabad areas, he said.
He said that he had spoken to the XEN of Phuleli about his electorates’ complaints with regard to electricity supply and he would keep raising them in his capacity as elected representative. The XEN’s application to seek registration of FIR against him was baseless and an attempt to harass him, he said.
He said that he would lead protests in support of his voters and supporters who always turned to him for help. Huge corruption was being made in the name of transformers’ repairs. If transformers were not replaced within 24 hours in his area he would be forced to resort to protest against Hesco, he warned.
MNA Salahuddin regretted that a federal entity’s official was seeking registration of FIR against MPA of a party which was an ally of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif. The prime minister must keep in mind how he had formed the government, he said. 
He said that not only MPA Nasir but all other parliamentarians would be courting arrest as well. The PM should remove Hesco CEO and XEN Phuleli, otherwise, the party would hold protests on the issue, he said.
He said that MQM had paid a heavy price for forming this coalition government. The PM should take things seriously and direct federal power minister to hold inquiry into Hesco officers’ corruption, he said. 
He said that Hesco line staff were part of MQM and they were being used by Hesco management to keep the party’s stronghold areas without electricity. 
Later, the MNA and the MPA led a procession of party workers to the SSP office to court arrest but police did not make any arrests.  Police said that no arrest could be made merely on the basis of a letter.
Shopkeepers protest against Hesco
Shopkeepers held a demonstration and blocked M.A. Jinnah Road near Market Chowk in Mirpurkhas on Thursday in protest against suspension of power to their market for 10 days. 
The protesters’ leader Asif Chodhry demanded the Hesco chief immediately restore power supply to their market. Hesco officials had collected Rs150 each from 500 shops in the market for restoring power supply but did nothing. 
They urged higher authorities to take action against the corrupt officials and ensure restoration of power supply to their shops as the power breakdown had seriously affected from 10 days.

The criminals are  criminals and we have to understand this. A person killed a young boy at a tea shop in Hyderabad and the  law has taken its course but we cannot term the incident as the crime by  a particular community as a whole.” 
Meanwhile, he took notice of  the killing of Bilal Kaka in Hyderabad on July 12 and  subsequent events, said an spokesperson for the chief minister in a  statement. “No one will be allowed to spoil the peace in Sindh,” vowed the chief minister.

5,"Terrorism FIR lodged against man for killing, ‘cooking’ wife in Karachi","Police official says efforts under way to arrest suspect, who fled along with his three children after the murder.","KARACHI: Police on Thursday registered a case regarding Wednesday’s gruesome murder of a woman and subsequent ‘cooking’ of her body parts in a cauldron in Gulshan-i-Iqbal.  
Investigations have been started to find out the motive behind the shocking incident. Efforts were being made to arrest the victim’s husband, who had fled along with his three children after the murder, said SSP-East Syed Abdul Rahim Sherazi.

7,"Nikah khawan should seek documentary proof of bride and groom’s age, court rules",Father of Dua Zehra files another plea for replacement of IO.,"KARACHI: A sessions court has ruled that a nikah khawan (marriage registrar) should not merely accept oral entries regarding the age of a bride and groom as he should verify an authentic official documentary proof of their age.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (East) Ilyas made this observation in a detailed order that dismissed the bail application of cleric Hafiz Ghulam Mustafa, who is facing trial for allegedly solemnising marriage of teenage Dua Zehra with Zaheer Ahmed.
Hafiz Mustafa, who is currently in judicial custody, had moved an application seeking his release from prison arguing that alleged abductee, Dua Zehra, had herself left her parents’ house and went to Lahore and contracted Nikah with Zaheer.
Defence counsel Aftab Bano argued that “abductee Dua Zehra had attained the age of puberty and can contract marriage with free will.”

Father of Dua Zehra files another plea for replacement of IO

However, the counsel said there was no eyewitness of their purported free-will marriage alleged to have been solemnised by her client Hafiz Mustafa to which Asghar Ali also allegedly signed as a witness.
However, the judge noted that as regards registration of Nikah, all Nikah Registrar or other persons who solemnise marriages are under legal obligation to scrutinise credentials at the time of Nikah.
“Mere submission of oral entries for the purpose of age should not be accepted unless any proof of age from parties to marriage preferable which should be in shape of some authentic document either issued by the National Database and Registration Authority in the form of National Identity Card/B-Form or School Leaving Certificate, Medical Certificate based on ossification test issued by the competent authority and Birth Certificate validly issued by the Union Council etc, is produced” the judge ruled in the order.
The court noted that in the present case it transpired that the applicant Hafiz Mustafa did not verify the necessary documents and, therefore, the witness of the Nikah, namely Asghar Ali, had also no credibility.
The judge observed that an offence committed under Section 364-A (kidnapping or abducting a person under the age of 14) of the Pakistan Penal Code is not bailable and falls within the prohibitory clause of Section 497 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 
“The heinous offence is of moral turpitude which can destroy the entire psychology of a victim by putting her and her family to public shame. It is a stigma with which the family has to face with and is the most hatred crime. Such kind of gruesome offence is not against the individual only but it is also against the good conscience of the society,” it said.
The judge concluded that the applicant was not entitled for concession of bail at this stage, hence bail application stand dismissed.
Meanwhile, Another sessions court on Thursday issued notices to the additional inspector general (investigation) and SSP-East (investigation) on a ‘second’ application seeking replacement of the investigating officer of the Dua Zehra abduction case.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (East) Muhammad Mehboob Awan also asked the police high-ups to appear on July 16 along with detailed reports/comments in this regard.
Syed Ali Mehdi Kazmi, Dua’s father, had moved an application under Section 22-A and B of the criminal procedure code (CrPC) against the Addl.IG (investigation) and SSP for allegedly not entertaining his requests to change DSP Shoukat Ali Shahani as the IO of the case.
His counsel, Jibran Nasir, submitted that suspect Zaheer Ahmed had kidnapped his client’s daughter from their Karachi home on April 16 and took to Lahore, adding that a medical board had declared Dua Zehra’s age between 15 and 16 years, close to 15.
He submitted that the first IO of the case, Inspector Saad Ahmed Thaheem, being satisfied with Nadra documents and passport about Dua’s age to be 14 years, had filed an interim charge sheet in court adding Section 3(i) of the Prevention of Trafficking in Person Act, 2018 read with Sections 3 and 4 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013.
IO Thaheem had also shown Zaheer, Shabbir Ahmed, cleric Hafiz Ghulam Mustafa and eyewitness of such marriage Asghar Ali as absconders, and prudently decided not to take any statement of the abductee recorded on face value.
The counsel said that the first IO, ‘after sincere efforts’, arrested the Nikah Khwan and witness, adding that he had also applied to a magistrate at Karachi for ordering an ossification test of Dua to determine her actual age, but the court declined the request.
Advocate Nasir alleged that the incumbent IO Shahani deliberately failed to appear before the Karachi’s relevant judicial magistrate on June 9 to seek remand of 10 detained relatives of the groom who were arrested on June 3 for allegedly facilitating Zaheer. Subsequently, the IO left the court with no objection but to discharge them from the case under Section 63 of the CrPC against personal bonds.
He pointed out that despite prime suspect Zaheer had provided his cell number to the IO, he ‘deliberately’ failed to obtain the call data record (CDR) to confirm his whereabouts during the period of Dua’s alleged kidnapping.
The applicant said despite the medical board had conducted fresh ‘age estimation test’ of Dua, the IO Shahani deliberately filed an investigation report recommending disposal of the case in “C” class by relying upon ‘tentative assessment’ of age of Dua.
He added that despite knowing the fact that Dua was under 16 years, the IO miserably failed to make any efforts to recover the abductee so far, adding that he also failed to arrest second witness of the underage marriage Shabbir Ahmed.
Therefore, the applicant pleaded to the court to order transfer of the case investigation from IO Shahani to an impartial and competent officer not below the rank of SP.

8,Academics call for fresh ad to appoint KU vice chancellor,Believe appointment process became ‘highly controversial’,"KARACHI: Describing the appointment process for the post of Karachi University’s vice chancellor as “highly controversial”, several senior teachers said the process lacked transparency and should be started afresh. 
Speaking to Dawn, teachers said the appointment process, still being contested in courts by some candidates, had lost credibility.
Last month, the chief minister had interviewed three shortlisted candidates — Prof Jamil Hasan Kazmi, former acting vice chancellor Prof Khalid Iraqi and Prof Moonis Ahmer — for the post of KU vice chancellor. However, a notification is still awaited. 
Pointing to major lapses in the process, he said the government had to revert to the old eligibility criteria on the court orders and then the Higher Education Commission (HEC) carried out a flawed exercise in the name of verifying candidates’ research papers.

Believe appointment process became ‘highly controversial’

“Teachers have no trust in this process which has only created more controversies over the past three years. The provincial authorities and the federal HEC are responsible for this mess,” shared Prof Shah Aliul Qader heading the Karachi University Teachers’ Society (Kuts).
“How could the commission ignored its past notifications and reject papers [of some candidates] published before 2005? This decision gave the impression that the commission wanted to direct [manipulate] affairs in a certain way,” he said, adding: “Then, we came to know that the chairman of the search committee has co-authored at least two papers with one candidate. Given this situation, I believe that even if the university gets a vice chancellor out of this process today, the incoming head wouldn’t be strong enough to manage university’s current challenges.”
Seconding his opinion, Kuts executive member Prof Samar Sultana said the chain of events from the publication of the advertisement for the post of KU vice chancellor in 2019, and the continued delay on part of the government to implement court orders suggested that the ‘delay meant to benefit a particular candidate who could complete the number of 25 research papers required as part of the eligibility criteria’. 
“We think that there should be fresh advertisement for the post, inviting applications from across the country. Second, there must not be any conflict of interest among the search committee members, including its head and the candidates, and the whole process of scrutiny and selection should be done in three months.”
‘A better competition’
Teachers were of the opinion that a new advertisement for the post would lead to a better competition as now the number of candidates eligible for the post from within KU had significantly increased.
“There were several female deans who didn’t apply for the post in 2019, thinking it would be inappropriate as the acting vice chancellor himself was a candidate for the post. But, now they would definitely join the race if the government provides them with an opportunity,” said Dr Bilquees Gul, senior professor and Director, Office of Research, Innovation and Commercialisation at KU.
Dr Abid Hasnain, retired professor and former dean science and director evening programme, however, believed that the government with three shortlisted candidates still have the opportunity to appoint a professor with impeccable character and academic integrity as KU’s vice chancellor. 
“It can make the right choice. Else, the other option should be to invite fresh applications,” he said, questioning the government decision to appoint a professor at 27th number in the seniority list as the acting vice chancellor in 2019. 
The rejected candidates alleged that the HEC verified journals and not papers as directed by the court. 
Mired in controversies, the appointment process was challenged in the Sindh High Court soon after the post was advertised in June, 2019. The government later issued a corrigendum in which the criteria relating to experience, research work and age was changed, apparently to benefit a few candidates.
The government had to revert to the old eligibility criteria on the orders of the court which directed it to consider all applicants for the post. 
It also had to re-form the search committee (again on the court orders) tasked to carry out the selection process after some candidates challenged it on the grounds that two members of the committee (former KU vice chancellors) had conflict of interest with Prof Iraqi who served as an advisor under them.
Recently, it came to surface that the incumbent head of the search committee had co-authored two research papers with Prof Iraqi, the shortlisted candidate for the post of KU vice chancellorship.
Also, sources pointed to the questionable role HEC had played in the verification of research papers assigned by the court.
It dropped out few candidates after rejecting their papers published before June, 2005, on the ground that they were not printed in the list of 181 HEC-verified journals. 
This list, sources said, didn’t exist before 2022, and that the HEC in its old directives had allowed university bodies to verify papers printed before 2005.

9,ACE stopped from arresting Sindh opposition leader Haleem Adil Sheikh in two graft inquiries,Provincial law officer seeks time from the SHC to get information regarding the status of inquires pending against Haleem.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday restrained the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) Sindh till Aug 3 from taking coercive action against Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh in two pending inquiries.
A provincial law officer sought time from the SHC to get information regarding the status of inquires pending against Mr Sheikh, who is a leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf.
Mr Shaikh, through his brother, approached the SHC against raids being conducted at the houses of the opposition leader and his relatives and sought details of all the pending inquiries or FIRs against him, asking the court to also order the ACE to not arrest him.
When a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro took up the matter for hearing, it was informed that only two inquiries were pending against petitioner at the ACE.
However, an assistant advocate general sought some time to get first-hand knowledge regarding status of those inquiries so that a proper order could be passed safeguarding rights of each party including the petitioner.
The petitioner’s lawyer filed a rejoinder along with bunch of documents in response to the comments of respondents and a copy of which was shared with the counsel representing the state.
“Since, so far only two inquiries are said to be pending against the petitioner, we are hopeful that till next date of hearing no coercive action would be taken against him in those two inquiries, save in accordance with law,” the bench stated in its order and adjourned the hearing till Aug 3.
Citing the Sindh chief secretary and ACE chairman as respondents, the petitioner alleged that after “regime change at the Centre, the ruling PPP in Sindh has also come in power at federal level and started fresh victimisation campaign against him in a bid to get budget approved without opposition”.
He submitted that the respondents might be restrained from causing his arrest till some material was placed in court and pleaded to grant protection so that he could conduct political activities on behalf of his party in connection with the upcoming local government in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions.
Earlier, the ACE in its comments said that an inquiry against the PTI leader and others was initiated in 2019 on the complaint of citizen Muhammad Ali Ghanchi for allegedly occupying his as well as state land wile a complaint was also lodged against him in 2020 at ACE Jamshoro office.
Ghauri left country after getting bail, SHC told
The SHC was informed on Thursday that former federal minister Babar Khan Ghauri has already left the country after getting bail in pending cases from a trial court.
The former port and shipping minister had moved the SHC seeking a restraining order for respondents from arresting him in hidden inquiries/cases and production of details of all such cases in court.
At the outset of the hearing on Thursday, an additional prosecutor general and assistant advocate general informed the bench that former minister had left Pakistan after getting bail and his petition had become infructuous.
However, the petitioner’s lawyer did not turn up and the bench adjourned the hearing till Aug 23 directing him to satisfy the court on the point maintainability of the petition.
Last month, the SHC had granted two-week protective bail to Mr Ghauri in a corruption reference and a money laundering and terror financing case and directed him to surrender before the trial courts within stipulated period.
However, he was arrested from Karachi airport on June 4 upon his return to the country and was released on July 13. He left the country for Dubai.

Their lawyer argued that in another lawsuit, the SHC had recently restrained Emaar Giga Karachi from advertising, promoting, offering further apartments/projects on reclaimed land and creating a third-party interest.
The counsel submitted that the case of plaintiffs was identical, as apartments handed out to them pursuant to the settlement agreement were identically placed and those apartments were not even in existence.
They asked the court to issue a similar restraining order.
In the meantime, Creek Marina Pvt Ltd has filed an intra-court appeal before a division bench of the SHC impugning the interim restraining order of the single-judge bench contending that some facts were not disclosed before the single bench and ad interim order was obtained ex-parte and sought its suspension.
