1,Parents of APS martyrs move Peshawar High Court over govt-TTP parleys,Seek orders for govt to take them into confidence; PHC issues notice to interior secretary for response to petition.,"PESHAWAR: Mothers of five of the students and teachers assassinated by militants in the 2014 Peshawar Army Public School attack have moved Peshawar High Court against the ongoing negotiations between the government and proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and sought directives for the government against ‘taking any step of reconciliation with the outfit without taking them into confidence’.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Abdul Shakoor issued a notice to the interior secretary asking him to respond to the petition, jointly filed by the mothers of four slain students and a woman teacher, on the next date of hearing to be fixed later.
The petitioners included Falak Naz, mother of students Noorullah and Saifullah, Shahana, mother of Asfand Khan, Seema, mother of Aimal Khan, and Zulaikha, mother of teacher Sadia Gul.
Advocate Ajoon Khan, who is the father of slain student Asfand Khan, appeared for the petitioners and contended that they were direct victims of the brutal act of killing innocent students and some of their teachers at the APS by the TTP militants, so negotiating with the outfit by the government without redressing their grievances would be a destruction of the justice system in the country.

Seek orders for govt to take them into confidence; PHC issues notice to interior secy for response to petition

The respondents in the petition are the defence ministry through its secretary, interior ministry through its secretary, federal government through law secretary, and focal person of the National Action Plan (NAP).
Mr Ajoon requested the court to issue directives to the government not to take any step of reconciliation with the TTP without taking his clients on board.
He said that the petitioners were the victim of one of the most brutal incident occurred in this country as a consequence of which minor students in large number were martyred.
The lawyer said that from time to time, families of the APS martyrs had protested and raised voice against the campus carnage not only in Peshawar but in other cities, including Islamabad, as well.
He added that the petitioners had also appeared and put forward their grievances before a one-member Judicial Commission consisting of Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, which was probing the matter on the order of the Supreme Court.
Mr Ajoon said the judicial commission had completed its probe and submitted its report to the apex court including its findings and recommendations. He added that some of the reservations of the petitioners had now been pending before the Supreme Court and they had regularly been appearing before it.
The counsel said his clients learned through print, electronic and social media that the federal government had started dialogue with the TTP and that only the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, which was heading the coalition government, had exclusively started it without taking into confidence other stakeholders.
He claimed that the Pakistan Peoples Party had objected to the negotiations and had demanded a joint sitting of parliament for discussing the matter.
Mr Ajoon, however, said instead of joint sitting the government had only convened meeting of a National Assembly standing committee to satisfy its coalition partner, whereas the victims of the APS carnage were completely ignored.
He contended that if any compromise took place between the government and the TTP without taking the stakeholders, especially the aggrieved parents of the slain students, into confidence, it would tarnish the country’s image across the world.

5,Measures afoot to prevent dengue fever outbreak,Official stresses need for coordination among relevant departments,"PESHAWAR: The health department has started implementation of Dengue Action Plan to prevent outbreak of the mosquito-borne ailment in the province.
In March this year, Dr Qasim Afridi, the programme manager of integrated vector control of the health department, informed Chief Secretary Dr Shahzad Khan Bangash through a presentation in a meeting about the preventive measures needed against dengue fever ahead of its peak season starting in July.
The chief secretary was informed that the department faced challenges, which needed to be addressed to put brakes on the vector-born disease. 
Dr Qasim said that uninterrupted supply of electricity and water was needed to prevent mosquito bites and avoid storage of water in addition to doing away with permanent stagnant water pools as these were breeding sites for mosquitoes.

Official stresses need for coordination among relevant departments

He pointed out poor coordination among different departments and requested for human resources from line departments to conduct anti-dengue activities at district level when required. He also talked about lack of dedicated staff and community-based surveillance at district level.
Dr Qasim, when contacted, said that the situation was under control at the moment as only 115 cases, including 43 from frontier region Dera Ismail Khan, were recorded so far. “We shouldn’t get relaxed and should continue to implement Dengue Action Plan 2022 to minimise incidence of dengue through multi-sectoral collaboration,” he added.
He also stressed the need for effective measures for environmental management, surveillance, control and response to spread of the vector in addition to training of staff, public awareness and involvement of the community to pave way for the enforcement of the strategy against dengue fever.
“We are also strictly monitoring reporting and implementation of the plan. We have deployed 41 entomologists throughout the province to stop mosquito breeding as these are the source of the transmission of the ailment,” said Dr Qasim. He said that the entomologists were qualified professionals and trained to check dengue transmission by containing the production of the mosquitoes on sustainable basis and halting spread of the virus.
He said that the province had been reporting dengue incidence and the cases soared to 25,243 in 2017, the highest number so far. “In 2018, we detected 1,022 cases, in 2019, 7,082 cases, in 2020, 69 cases and in 2021 we recorded 10,615 cases. It means the province is endemic for the virus but long term measures can eradicate it once and for all,” he added.
Dr Qasim said that Chief Secretary Dr Shahzad Khan Bangash, himself a medical doctor, took keen interest in implementation of the plan and sanctioned emergency fund of Rs70 million for the purpose. “We are also awaiting release of the funds to ensure that the plan is fully enforced. 
The role of districts is very crucial as we need early detection of the disease to respond promptly, especially for elimination of larva,” he added.
He said that district administrations were playing vital role in the strategy. “The deputy commissioners are leading the efforts at the district level in coordination of all line departments to eliminate stagnant water pools and carry out spray where it is needed. At present the Larva House Index is far low. It is five, which is regarded dangerous but our activities continue unabated,” he added.
Peshawar, the capital of the province has been the epicentre of dengue fever because it is populous and the infected people from other districts also visit it to seek treatment. Nevertheless, patients can be managed in every district hospital.
Dr Qasim said that dengue virus thrived in clean water often stored in open pots and drums. “We should ensure that the people get regular water supply so that they don’t need to store it. Scaling up awareness among the people in auto-workshops and tyres shops also necessary as these are potential breeding sites for mosquitoes,” he added.

Set up in 1951 in the main administration block of UoP, the three-storey library stacks around 696 rare manuscripts of oriental languages including Urdu, Arabic, Persian, Sindhi, Pashto and Punjabi alongside over 170,000 titles on a variety of subjects. The library treasured ‘Fitawa-i-Naqashbandi’ authored by Maulana Moinuddin, one of the three copies in the world.
The UoP administration recently decided to upgrade the library. The project will be completed by September this year.
Dr Yorid Ahsan Zia, project director, told this scribe that upgradation of the central library was a component of funded project ‘strengthening of academic and professional facilities’ at UoP. He added that the students of BS, MS, MPhil, PhD and post-doc would benefit from the upgradation of the library.
He said that uplift of the library included rehabilitating of its infrastructure, provision of latest books to it, database and digitisation of books issuance and return.
“The upgraded library will provide for discussion rooms, stack area, digital section, oriental section, books preservation section, manuscript display and a computer lab. The book searching, issuance and return will be facilitated through online public access catalogue, radio frequency identification, tagging and self check-in/check-out station,” said Mr Zia.
Prof Fakhrul Islam, the director of Area Study Centre, said that uplift of central library of UoP would not only facilitate research students on the campus but would also help to promote habit of reading among them.
“Unfortunately, universities lack a system that should motivate students to turn to libraries for amassing knowledge,” he said.
Ansarullah Khan, a student and initiator of study circles on the campus said, that state-of-the-art library being an essential component of the university in fact served as brain wielder where young minds gained creative strength from the treasure of books to form a world view. The uplifting of the central library was a praiseworthy job amid the mounting financial crises, he said.
Zareena Hafsa, a PhD scholar of social anthropology department, said that girl students would draw maximum benefits from the upgraded facility on the campus.

POWER OUTAGES: The residents of different areas of Khyber expressed their anger through social media over power loadshedding during Eid days.
The social activists and local political leaders had earlier urged people to hold protest demonstrations in Bara, Jamrud and Landi Kotal. However, the demonstrations could not be organised as most of the people were busy in slaughtering sacrificial animals during the Eid days.
The political and social activists then took to social media platforms to direct their guns towards the local grid station authorities. They alleged in their posts that residents in most parts of Khyber were subjected to almost 22 hours of continuous power suspension while the voltage remained very low during the rest of the day, which rendered most of the electric appliances ineffective.
Residents of Loe Shalman alleged that they spent all the three days of Eid without electricity, which also caused severe water shortage in their homes. They said that the excessive power loadshedding was violation of the earlier official promises about unhindered power supply during Eidul Azha.
The grid station staff, however, contented that the loadshedding was not intentional and they had to resort to such practice due to some necessary repair work in the huge transformers.
