1,Former NA speaker Qaiser challenges FIA inquiry against him in Peshawar High Court,Insists PTI’s two bank accounts earlier managed by him never received funds from abroad.,"PESHAWAR: Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser on Wednesday moved the Peshawar High Court against the start of an inquiry by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) into two bank accounts of his party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, managed by him from 2008 to 2013 as its then provincial president.
Mr Qaiser filed a petition requesting the court to set aside a notice issued by a FIA official to appear before him in connection with the bank accounts inquiry. He wanted that inquiry to be declared illegal and based on mala fide.
The petitioner also sought interim relief from the court requesting it to suspend action on the inquiry and stop the respondents, including the relevant FIA officials, from issuing ‘adverse’ orders against him until the disposal of the case.
The FIA deputy director (commercial banking circle), Peshawar, had ordered that inquiry in the wake of the Aug 2 pronouncement of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) that the PTI had received funds from prohibited sources.

Insists PTI’s two bank accounts earlier managed by him never received funds from abroad

A notice was issued by the inquiry officer, sub-inspector Irfanullah, to Mr Qaiser asking him to appearbefore him in that inquiry on Aug 11 at 2pm.
Respondents in the petition filed through Barrister Gohar Khan include the federal government through federal interior secretary, FIA through its director general, FIA deputy director (CBC), Peshawar, and inquiry officer Irfanullah.
The petitioner contended that the FIA deputy director had initiated the impugned inquiry illegally and with ulterior motives, while the notice issued to him on Aug 5 was without lawful authority.
He said he was elected the president of the PTI Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2008 and held that office until 2013.
The petitioner said both Article 17(3) of the Constitution and Article 13 of the Political Parties Order, 2002, declared that an enlisted political party should disclose the source of its funds but there was no mention of the details of bank accounts.
He added that only those bank accounts were covered in which an enlisted political party had received funds whether prohibited or not.
Mr Qaiser contended that the PTI had disclosed all bank accounts, which received funds, and they totalled eight.
The petitioner said all political parties had separate wings, including provincial offices or organisations, and that they sometimes opened and maintained bank accounts in their respective areas for own matters.
He added that those bank accounts had nothing to do with ‘sources of funding’ of the enlisted political party i.e. PTI and not PTI Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and that for the same reason, the ECP had never called any regional wing, including PTI KP, to appear before it or explain any aspect of the sources of funding or accounts.
Mr Qaiser said there were 11 such bank accounts, including two of the PTI’s KP chapter opened in the Habib Bank Limited and KASB/Bank Islami that were never used to receive foreign funding.
The petitioner said that even beyond the scope of the findings of the ECP, the FIA deputy director (CBC) alleged “that in light of paras 41 and 43 of the ECP order dated 2.8.2022, inquiry is being conducted to probe illegalities committed in opening/ operating of bank accounts.” The notice was issued by the inquiry officer to appear on Aug 11.
He contended that the ECP had not even held that any law had been violated in opening of those accounts or that any authority other than the ECP including the FIA should take action or assume jurisdiction.
Meanwhile, Mr Qaiser told reporters on the premises of the high court that the court was likely to take up his plea for preliminary hearing today (Thursday).
He said the two bank accounts were opened for the convenience of the party’s local organisation to pay salaries to employees and manage office expenses and had no connection with foreign funding.
The former NA speaker said those accounts were currently dormant and only Rs2.1 million transactions had taken place through them in six years. He claimed that Imran Khan would be the future prime minister.

5,Regional health directorates yet to be fully operational,RHDs established to resolve issues of dept at local level,"PESHAWAR: The regional health directorates, established by the government to resolve financial and administration issues at the local level and reduce workload on the directorate-general health services, are yet to become fully operational due to lack of resources.
“The regional health directorates (RHDs) set up in Malakand, Peshawar, South region and Abbottabad haven’t started executing the powers delegated to them from the office of director-general health services mainly due to non-availability of vehicles, offices and required infrastructure,” sources told this scribe.
They said that RHDs were meant to resolve health issues locally instead of sending them to the director-general as the later was supposed to implement the government’s policies with regard to epidemics such as dengue, Covid-19 and cholera etc and look into provincial matters.
“However, the office of director-general continues to handle the regional financial, administrative, technical and human resources issues as it was doling before the appointment of regional directors,” said sources.

RHDs established to resolve issues of dept at local level

RHDs have three deputy directors each and have the powers to make appointments up to BPS-16 and order transfers within the region independently but these matters are still being sent to the office of director-general health. 
The purpose of these directorates haven’t been fulfilled as the office director-general remains busy in petty matters and can’t find time to fully focus on bigger public health, inquiries and monitoring issues.
The director-general also visits the provincial assembly to respond to questions regarding health problems, carries out performance evaluation in addition to making plans and their implementation. “The regional directors don’t have budget and designated vehicles as per notification that affected their mobility and operations,” said sources.
They said that only the regional directorate in Abbottabad started functioning that reduced burden on the office of director-general health. “The others are yet to show any progress,” they added.
Sources said they the need to appoint regional directors had been felt to allow the office of director-general health to give time to collaboration with international organisations on the pattern of divisional directors, who enjoyed vast powers from 80s when the positions were abolished after Local Government Ordinance, 2001.
They said that on papers, they had all powers but practically, they were just post offices and the DG office stayed overload with work coming from all regions, except Abbottabad.
Officials at the health department, however, dispelled the impression about non-existence of facilities for regional directors and said that they had been directed to start full-scale operations.
“Most of the employees from these regions visited DG office in Peshawar in connection with their transfers and matters relating to patients’ care. It is waste of time. Therefore, we want these directorates to become fully operational to handle procurements, repairs of equipments, leaves of the employees and financial matters,” they said.
They said that the regional directors could recommend transfer of BPS-17 and 18 health secretariat employees through DG office. The RHDs with vast administrative powers were meant to ensure prompt healthcare service delivery at primary and secondary levels, they added.
The department had re-designated four posts of additional director general of BPS-20 at the DG office as RDs being part of the programme to decentralise powers to do with delays in financial and administrative issues, officials said. 
They added health secretary issued strict directives and asked the DG office to make the RHDs fully operational.

Led by Khar tehsil council chairman Haji Said Badshah, the protesters said that over 10,000 candidates had applied against 127 posts of class-IV in the LG department which were advertised about eight months ago.

11,PHC declares police promotions subject to its approval,Seeks govt response to petition against new police seniority list.,"PESHAWAR: While seeking response of the federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments to a petition against the new seniority list of police officers, the Peshawar High Court on Wednesday declared that senior level promotions in the department were subject to the court approval.
A bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Fazal Subhan directed the Establishment Division, establishment department and provincial police officer (PPO) to file replies to the petition by Sept 13 and adjourned the hearing until then.
“If any promotions of police officers are made through the provincial selection board, they will be subject to decision of the court in this petition,” it said.
The petition is jointly filed by superintendent of police (security) Salahuddin Khan and six other police officers requesting the court to declare the impugned seniority list issued on June 28, 2022, by the additional inspector general (AIG) (Establishment) as unconstitutional and against Articles 142, 240 and 260 of the Constitution.

Seeks govt response to petition against new police seniority list

The petitioners have also challenged the intended promotions through provincial selection board (PSB) of officers of BPS-17 and above questioning whether the provincial government was competent to promote such officers or it was the domain of the federal government.
The petitioners requested the court to direct the respondents, including the provincial government and provincial police officer, to restore an earlier seniority list of DSPs (BPS-17) issued on Feb 21, 2022, as it was based on the relevant laws and rules.
The petitioners highlighted the Police Service of Pakistan (Composition, Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985, and said those rules declare that promotions to BPS-18 should be made on the basis of 40 per cent quota reserved for the provincial police cadre.
They prayed the court to direct the respondents to prepare joint seniority list of senior officers in BPS-17, including ASPs and DSPs, in light of those rules and then make promotion to BPS-18 on the basis of 40 per cent quota of provincial police officers.
Advocates Anwarul Haq, Haji Mohammad Shoaib and Mohammad Ahmad Khan appeared for the petitioners whereas additional advocate general Khalid Rehman represented the provincial government.
The counsel for petitioners said their clients served as senior police officers (BPS-17) in the police department.
They said the petitioners, who were promoted as DSPs, had successfully undertaken various obligations and missions.
Mr Anwar said a seniority list meant for DSPs was issued on Feb 21, 2022, but violating different procedures and rules, the list was revised and instead, the impugned list was issued in June 2022 by the AIG (Establishment) without citing any cogent reason.
The lawyer said under Police Service of Pakistan (Composition, Cadre and Seniority) Rules, 1985, 40 per cent quota was reserved for promotion and ‘encadrement’ for officers of the police cadre of the province for which joint seniority list had to be prepared. He added that the respondents had never followed the criteria and rules.
The AAG requested the court to provide him some time for filing comments on behalf of the government.

12,Pashto singer calls for official patronage of classical music,PESHAWAR: Renowned musician and singer Tahir Khan has complained about lack of government patronage of Pashto...,"PESHAWAR: Renowned musician and singer Tahir Khan has complained about lack of government patronage of Pashto classical music, saying it is hurtful to find no representation of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the events wherein classical artists show up from across the country.
“Classical music has long been suffering from the government’s neglect but things are worse when it comes to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is in a sorry state because the people at the helm of affairs don’t understand it. They recognise and support popular genres of music without realising that popularity does not necessarily mean quality. So classical music has no support or patronage,” he told Dawn.
The musician said that it pained him to see that there was no one other than him to represent the province in the countrywide functions of classical music. It was his childhood desire to learn and play classical music but as there was no one in the province to teach him, he went to Rawalpindi, Lahore and Hyderabad to gain the knowledge and skills of classical music from its maestros.
“Taught by the legendary Ustads like Fateh Ali Khan Sahib, RA Khan Sahib and Ghulam Hassan Shagan Sahib of Gwalior Gharana and Mubarik Ali Khan Sahib of Kirana Gharana, I have been associated with this music for over 40 years and have represented Pakistan in the US, Canada, Japan and many other countries,” he said.
Besides performing on national and regional television channels and radio stations, Tahir Khan also conducts workshops on music with the collaboration of Pakistan National Council of Arts, Agha Khan Foundation and Small Music World Society, 
Canada. A book titled ‘Who is who in the world of music in Pakistan’ carries his name due to his contributions to Pashto music in the country. He also remained part of the Lok Virsa board of governors as representative of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Tahir Khan regretted the indifference of Pakhtuns towards classical music and raga-based ghazals. He said that being alone in the struggle of preserving and reviving the endangered classical music in the province, he trained Pashto-speaking people, especially youth, free of charge.
He said that he was admired by Pashto music legends like Khiyal Mohammad, Hidayatullah and Gulzar Alam. He said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa hadn’t produced a ghazal artist like Khiyal Mohammad.
