A meeting in this regard was held at the Capital Development Authority (CDA) headquarters, presided over by the authority’s chairman Amer Ali Ahmed. 
Talking to Dawn, participants of the meeting said that the flyover and roads of the Rawal Dam project would be completed in the next two days before their formal inauguration on Independence Day.
They said that lighting and lane marking work was underway now.
According to an official, the underpass would most probably be completed after one month.

Lighting work, lane marking underway, say CDA officials

Talking about the interchange, he said the project would be inaugurated on substantial completion of the flyover. Before today’s meeting, the CDA chairman and officials of the engineering wing visited both sites on Tuesday and directed the officials concerned to ensure completion of these two projects by August 14.
Meanwhile, a press release issued by the civic body on Wednesday stated that a major part of the interchange of Rawal Dam had been completed.
“Asphalt [on flyover] done and now uplift of the surrounding is being done. After a couple of days lane marking will be carried out and art work completed. New Jersey barriers are being completed in the next two to three days and then this bridge/flyover will be opened for public,” the press release stated, adding that the remaining work on the underpass shall continue and completed in the next 20-30 days, depending upon the weather. 
It is relevant to note here that the original deadline of this project is October, however, due to directions issued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, officials of the civic agency remained on their toes to get the work done. Work on the project, worth Rs1.1 billion, began in October 2020.
Meanwhile, officials said that work on the 7th Avenue project is also almost complete. An interchange is being built at the junction of 7th Avenue, Srinagar Highway, Khayaban-i-Suhrwardi and Garden Avenue near Aabpara. As compared to other projects of the CDA, this project was executed speedily as according to PC-I, its original deadline is October.
The interchange will act like a cloverleaf, with four left and right loops, while there is an underpass to link both portions of it with Khayaban-i-Suhrwardi. Construction of the interchange was planned in 2008 and many times, the CDA management discussed it, but no practical progress was made until last year. 
It must be noted that due to a bottle neck at this junction, motorists would face traffic congestion for years and the long wait at traffic signals would test their patience. Now, after completion of this project, Srinagar Highway would become one of the fastest roads of the city.

He also called upon the Ministry of Education and Professional Training to play role in bringing all stakeholders from the public and private sectors on one platform to devise a vision and strategy for extending educational services to hitherto neglected areas of the country by pooling their resources.
The president was chairing a meeting related to Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) at Aiwan-i-Sadr. He called for further enhancing the quality and outreach of Open Distance Learning (ODL) programmes of AIOU, and using blended learning tools to increase the enrolment of students in different academic disciplines.
He said that educating and imparting skills to students according to the market dynamics would help ensure their early employment besides helping in their career progression. The president expressed these views during a follow-up briefing on AIOU, Islamabad, on Wednesday.
AIOU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Ziaul Qayyum, the university’s dean, Prof Dr Nasir Mahmood, senior AIOU officials, representatives of Higher Education Commission and the education ministry attended the meeting.
The President emphasized the need for investing in the formal and ODL modes of education which were the most important platforms for providing education to the masses.
He said that ODL and hybrid modes of education could be extended to the Primary and Middle school levels after coordination with the relevant stakeholders from the public and private sectors.
This, he said, would help in educating the OOSC, who could not attend regular schools due to financial or other constraints. He said that Malaysia was far ahead in all forms of education than Pakistan due to heavy investment in this sector although Pakistan had helped Malaysia in setting up its institutes of higher learning.
President Alvi appreciated the performance of AIOU in providing quality education to those who could not afford expensive private schools or full-time schooling. He further advised the University to establish its own marketing and public relations department headed by a qualified professional to market its products not only in Pakistan but to the rest of the world.
He also urged the need to double up efforts to market and highlight the 24,000 licenses available under the Digital Learning and Skills Enrich Initiatives of HEC and COURSERA to maximise the use of this important educational resource which provided over 1000 ready-made courses in various disciplines.
AIOU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Ziaul Qayyum, briefed the president that AIOU was planning to launch a Life Long Learning Centre besides working on designing Pakistan EdTech, establishing collaboration with the Universities of Turkiye and Leicester University and establishing a Centre of Excellence in Open Distance Learning.

5,"14 inquiries into tree tsunami project pending, NA told",Sherry says audit being carried out at the federal level as well...,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Wednesday informed the National Assembly that 14 inquiries into the Billion Tree Tsunami project were pending with the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
“NAB has not shared details of these inquiries and their status is unclear,” Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman said.
She was responding to questions from Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) MNA Barjees Tahir, who had alleged that the Billion Tree Tsunami was a scandal and needed to be investigated.
In her replies, Senator Rehman said investigation and audit of the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami project, which was partially funded by provinces, was also underway at the federal level.
The project was a tree plantation drive launched in 2014 by the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in response to the challenge of global warming and to restore 350,000 hectares of forest and degraded land.

Sherry says audit being carried out at the federal level as well

The minister informed the house that in the last three years, Sindh had achieved 72pc of the targeted plantation. Out of one billion trees, Sindh had planted 723.5 million saplings. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had achieved 65pc of the targeted plantation by scattering 645.9 million seeds out of one billion. Punjab came in third by achieving 61pc targeted plantation. The province planted 282.08 million saplings. Balochistan was able to achieve only 12pc of the target by planting 12.1 saplings out of 100 million.
Out of 3.2 billion trees, 1.8 billion saplings had been planted across the country, which was 56pc of the total plantation drive.
However, MNA Fehmida Mirza challenged these figures, saying that not a single sapling had been planted in her constituency in lower Sindh and Badin where sea intrusion had destroyed significant agricultural land.
In her response, Senator Rehman defended the project and said the 72pc plantation target achieved by Sindh was already mentioned in the Guinness Book of Records. Still, she said she would provide specific details about the subject.
Pakistan has been ranked as the eighth most vulnerable country to climate change according to the ‘Global Climate Risk Index 2021’ in terms of climate-related challenges including water stress, desertification glacier melting, extreme weather events and spread of diseases, the minister said.
Replying to another query during the question hour session, the minister said: “I would rather term Pakistan as a climatically-affected country despite our meagre contribution to the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are 0.8pc as per the GHG inventory, 2018.”
She said the National Forest Policy was approved in 2017 by the government for promotion of plantation in the country, adding that the policy provided a basis for the federal government to extend support to all provinces and territories towards achieving their respective targets related to forestry and meet international obligations by fulfilling capacity and financial gaps.
The minister said various major initiatives had been taken to implement the policy, adding that the Federal Forestry Board was reactivated to ensure integrated efforts for improvement of forests whereas six meetings of the board had been held since 2018.
“The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan were approved in 2018 to conserve the existing natural resources,” she said, adding that the protected areas initiative was started to improve management of natural habitats of existing protected areas in the country. It was estimated that the protected areas in the country would increase from 12pc in 2018 to 15pc in 2023.
Pakistan’s Forest Reference Emission Level was prepared with the support of all provinces to estimate emissions from the forestry sector. It was endorsed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 2021, she said.
Ms Rehman said the Green Pakistan Programme provided about 350,000 green jobs.

6,AJK court summons minister over his conduct with chief justice,"MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered AJK minister for law, justice and...","MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered AJK minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs Sardar Faheem Akhtar Rabbani to personally appear before it on Friday for explanation of his conduct.
The order was issued after Mr Rabbani made a phone call to Chief Justice (CJ) Raja Saeed Akram when he was offering condolences along with two brother judges to Mohammad Azam Khan, one of his predecessors, on the demise of the latter’s sister on the outskirts of Mirpur on Wednesday afternoon.
According to the order, after receiving the call from the minister’s personal assistant, the chief justice was made to hold on until the minister came on line and requested him [the CJ] to convene a meeting of the secretaries of the political parties.
“Prima facie, this indecent act of the Law Minister is contemptuous and amounts to undermining the authority of the Chief Justice who has nothing to do with the meeting of [the] secretaries of the political parties,” the order said.
Keeping in view the gravity of the matter, the CJ immediately convened the meeting of the Judges Council to discuss the conduct of the minister. The council meeting concluded with a unanimous decision to call for an explanation from the minister in this regard.
According to the order, the apex court’s Mirpur circuit office had been directed to serve a notice on Mr Rabbani to appear in person before the court in Mirpur on Friday (August 12) and explain that under what authority/capacity he had directly called the CJ and made a request for holding a meeting with the secretaries of the political parties.
The minister would also explain the way he had talked to the chief justice on telephone.
The court also directed the circuit office to serve a notice on Advocate General Khawaja Maqbool War to ensure the minister’s presence before it on the given date and time.
Though the court order did not specify as to why the minister wanted the CJ to convene a meeting, it was however believed that the government in consultation with other major political parties wanted to seek another extension from the apex court in a deadline for holding long due local bodies (LB) polls in the state.
On July 20, the AJK apex court had extended the deadline it had earlier given to the government for holdingLBpollsfrom Aug 30 to Oct 15 after the advocate general had sought a respite till November this year while citing financial constraints and some other administrative issues.
The full court, headed by CJ Akram, had however made it clear that it would not not grant any further extension to the government in this regard.

11,PTI leader tasked with creating liaison with media,The task to create a liaison with journalists has been given to Deputy Information Secretary Dr Mohammad Amjad.,"ISLAMABAD: After realising its disconnect with the media, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has decided to bridge the gap between the party and media. 
The task to create a liaison with journalists has been given to Deputy Information Secretary Dr Mohammad Amjad.
On Wednesday, PTI chairman Imran Khan, in a video conference, claimed that some media houses were not giving coverage to his party and those that were had been banned. He feared that soon curbs would be announced on social media due to which it might not be possible to raise a voice in favour of the PTI.

Imran to meet journalists soon

Dr Amjad, who had joined the PTI in February this year, held a meeting with journalists on Wednesday. “Recently, during a meeting, in which Mr Khan and Information Secretary Farrukh Habib were present, Mr Habib assigned me to create a liaison with mediapersons. So I am holding a meeting with you. In the next meeting Farrukh Habib will also be present and then a meeting of journalists will be held with Mr Khan,” he said.
Replying to questions, he said there was a disconnect between media and the party, adding that Imran Khan would hold public meetings in all nine constituencies which had been vacated due to acceptance of resignations by the National Assembly speaker and notifications issued by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
“Despite the fact that we have resigned from seats of National Assembly, the party has decided that it will participate in all the by-elections to keep voters motivated and involved in the election process,” he said.
When asked about whether Mr Khan was still determined to contest by-elections on nine seats, Dr Amjad said that the decision was made to stop the government from accepting resignations in phases.
“We are hopeful that Imran Khan will win all the by-elections and then the ECP will have to hold elections on those seats again. In case the party chairman decides not to contest election himself, as de-notified leaders have already started election campaigns in their constituencies, Mr Khan will lead the campaign himself. He will hold at least one public meeting in each of the constituencies,” he said.

15,"Shutter down, wheel-jam strike in Muzaffarabad division tomorrow","Traders, transporters and students join hands against issues facing the area...","MUZAFFARABAD: Three districts of Muzaffarabad division will observe a “shutter down and wheel-jam” strike on Friday under a “save the state drive” to draw attention towards a host of issues facing the area, including power outages, inflated electricity bills and proposed “displeasing” constitutional amendments.
An announcement was made by Markazi Anjuman-i-Tajran Muzaffarabad chairmanShaukat Nawaz Mir, Muzaffarabad Transport Union President Khawaja Azam Rasool, Murtaza Banday and other leaders of the Students’ Action Committee at a joint press conference on Wednesday.
They demanded of the legislative assembly members from both sides of the divide to unanimously approve a resolution to establish the rights of the AJK people on the moveable and immoveable resources of their state.
“It’s high time the people across the liberated territory swing into action to save their state,” said Mr Mir while sharing his views on “important issues of public concern”.

Traders, transporters and students join hands against issues facing the area

“The proposed 15th constitutional amendment is in fact aimed at robbing the elected government in Muzaffarabad of its financial and executive authority and cannot be accepted at any cost,” he said.
“Similarly, the proposed tourism authority bill is also aimed at land-grabbing under official cover rather than facilitating investors in the tourism sector and thus is insupportable,” he added.
Mr Mir said none of the state subjects was averse to development of his state but could not and would not allow usurpation of its resources.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Rasool pointed out that the AJK territory produced around 3,500 megawatts of cheap electricity but nevertheless it was a “constant victim of forced loadshedding”.
“First the authorities concerned should meet local needs and then transmit the remaining electricity to the national grid,” he demanded.
Mr Rasool, who was administrator of Municipal Corporation Muzaffarabad in the previous PML-N government, said the diversion of Neelum River for Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (NJHP) had subjected state capital Muzaffarabad to innumerable environmental issues, including shortage of potable water, which ought to be addressed on a war footing.
Side by side, he stressed, the federal government should also constitute a high-powered judicial commission to probe the mega corruption in the NJHP where power generation had recently come to a grinding halt due to cracks in the tunnel.
In a visible reference to the proposed Kohala hydropower project, Mr Rasool made it clear that people of Muzaffarabad would not allow any further diversion of their rivers in the wake of their first “bitter beyond description” experience in the NJHP.
“Inaction on this and many other issues has forced the transport union to keep their vehicles off roads on Friday,” he said, 
calling upon tourists to avoid travelling to Muzaffarabad, Neelum and Jhelum valley districts on Friday.
Mr Banday and his colleagues maintained that since these issues had a direct bearing on the future of the younger generations, the student community had decided to join Friday’s activities with zeal and zest.
They also demanded the government to restore student unions in Azad Kashmir without further waste of time.
