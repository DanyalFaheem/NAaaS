• Police get two-day physical remand of PTI leader
• Fawad claims Gill abducted by personnel in cars with ‘missing number plate’
• Minister says arrest made in accordance with law on charges of sedition 
ISLAMABAD: A day after his arrest in connection with ‘hateful remarks’ against the army in a TV programme, a four-member special investigation team (SIT) was constituted on Wednesday to probe the case registered against Shahbaz Gill, chief of staff to former prime minister Imran Khan, on several charges, including sedition, Dawn has learnt.  
According to a notification, the SIT was tasked with collecting the relevant information from the individuals, officials and departments concerned relating to the case. The SSP investigation will obtain digital information form the Pakistan Tele­communication Autho­rity for the purpose of investigation and submit a progress report to the DIG operations within seven days.  
The SIT headed by the SSP investigation comprises the sub-divisional police officer and SHO Kohsar and a sub-inspector, who is also an investigation officer of the case.  
Shahbaz Gill was arrested from Banigala while on his way to Imran Khan’s residence on Tuesday, capital police officers told Dawn. A case was registered against him at Kohsar police station under several sections Pakistan Penal Code, including 124-A (sedition), 131 (abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from his duty), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot if rioting be committed; if not committed), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups, etc), and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), among others.  
According to the FIR, a programme was aired on a news channel in which Shahbaz Gill appeared as a guest. Answering a question, he tried to create a divide between the officers below the rank of brigadier and above, besides trying to affiliate the officers below the rank of brigadier with a political party, it added.  
Mr Gill also tried to provoke mutiny among the officers of Pakistan Army and civil servants, asking them not to follow government’s orders and threatening them that Pakistan would become a colony of America and India if they do not wage a war or conduct mutiny, the FIR said.  
Produced in court 
On Wednesday morning, police produced Shahbaz Gill before the court of Judicial Magistrate Omer Shabir. After hearing arguments, the magistrate handed him over to police on a two-day physical remand and asked them to produce him on August 12.  
“Investigation officer requested for a 14-day physical remand of the accused [Shahbaz Gill] for purpose of investigation and it has been submitted that physical custody of the accused is required by the police for investigation of other persons allegedly involved in the commission of the alleged offence, recovery of mobile phone allegedly used for the commission of the offence, for voice matching of the accused through forensics, and also to verify the interview given by him,” stated an order issued by the magistrate’s court.  
Advocate General Jahangir Jadoon and state prosecutor Naveed Akhtar argued that physical remand was necessary for investigation, forensics in respect of voice matching and for verification of video from the media house and also to investigate the matter in respect of the involvement of other co-accused, if any.  
However, Mr Gill’s counsel Faisal Fareed and Syed Mohammad Ali Bukhari argued that no ground for grant of physical remand existed, and the accused was already in police custody for the last 24 hours, adding that police had already obtained the video of TV programme.  
Advocate Fareed alleged that his client had been tortured and requested for his medical examination. At this, the magistrate directed the investigation officer to get his medical examination done.  
The police officers said the investigators had obta­ined the video of news bulletin of the news channel aired at 4.15pm on August 8, and its transcript from the Pakistan Electronic Me­­dia Regulatory Autho­rity (Pemra). Mr Gill’s mobile phone was also confiscated and would be sent for forensic test, and to the FIA for recovery of data and other relevant record, they added.  
The officers said more arrests are likely, including those who conducted the TV programme with Mr Gill, adding that three persons who were considered co-accused went into hiding, and there were reports that one of them escaped abroad. “The FIA immigration department is being approached to get the travel history of the accused,” they added.  
On Tuesday, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry claimed that Mr Gill had been abducted from Banigala Chowk by unidentified personnel in cars with missing number plate.  
Later at a news conference, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said Shahbaz Gill was arrested by Islamabad police in accordance with the law on charges of sedition and inciting the public against state institutions.  
The minister alleged that PTI chief Imran Khan had been working on a narrative to create divide in the military after realising that he had been trapped in the prohibited funding case and Toshakhana reference. A private news channel was also involved in the conspiracy, he alleged, adding that the channel had been issued a show-cause notice by Pemra on Monday for airing hateful and seditious remarks made by Mr Gill.

KARACHI/LAHORE/ISLAM­ABAD: Police on Wednesday registered a sedition case against the CEO of ARY News and others associated with it, and arrested the channel’s head of news and current affairs, Ammad Yousaf.
The FIR was registered at the Memon Goth police station on behalf of the state by a police officer over a controversial interview by PTI leader Dr Shahbaz Gill broadcast on the channel on Aug 8.
Meanwhile, journalist and rights bodies condemned the ban on the channel and Mr Yousaf’s arrest. The country’s media bodies also moved court against the arrest and suspension of the channel’s transmission.
A senior police officer who wished not to be named said Mr Yousaf, who is also the senior executive vice president of ARY News, was likely to be presented before a Karachi court on Thursday (today). ARY Controller News Siraj Ahmed told Dawn two police mobiles and a Vigo double cabin vehicle reached Mr Yousaf’s residence in DHA at around 2:30am on Wednesday, entered by scaling the walls and detained him.
Meanwhile, the channel on its website claimed Mr Yousaf was picked up “without a warrant from his residence”. “Police officers along with plain-clothed persons forcibly entered the house of Ammad Yousaf. The raiding team diverted the CCTV cameras of Yousaf’s house, and jumped into the house from the top of the main entrance. It also took away the… DVR of the CCTV cameras installed in the house,” it added.
The first information report (FIR) against ARY Digital Network President and CEO Salman Iqbal, Yousaf, anchorpersons Arshad Sharif and Khawar Ghumman and a producer was registered under sections 120, 124-A, 131, 153, 153-A, 505, 506, 121, 109 and 34 of the PPC.
The complainant, Memon Goth SHO Ateequr Rehman, said on Aug 8, he saw a viral clip on social media featuring an ARY News show wherein PTI’s Dr Gill had made “hateful remarks” against the army. Anchor Sharif and the channel’s Islamabad Bureau Chief Ghumman participated in the show as analysts.
He claimed that by expressing such views, PTI and ARY News were creating a “divide” between sections of armed forces, sowing hatred and rebellion in the army and also threatening government officers against following the government’s directives.
“This is a premeditated and an organised conspiracy” perpetrated “in collusion with the channel’s produ­c­­er, director and CEO, the FIR added.
On the other hand, soon after the authorities came down hard on ARY News, it softened its aggressive stan­­ce regarding an alleged campaign against it, and disowned Gill’s statement. In a video uploaded to the channel’s twitter page on Tuesday, anchorperson Kashif Abbasi read out the channel and its CEO’s version, saying they condemned the PTI leader’s statement and that ARY News had never been and nor will it ever be a part of any conspiracy aga­inst the army, judiciary or any institution. “…when we take anyone on line we cannot read his mind to know what will be said on TV,” Mr Abbasi quoted the statement as saying.
While anchorperson Arshad Sharif has left the country, producer Adeel Raja and Mr Ghumman have gone into hiding.
After the said programme was aired on Aug 8, there were reports of the channel going off air in many parts of the country that evening. A couple of hours later, Pemra had issued a show-cause notice to ARY News for airing what it called was “false, hateful and seditious” content based on “absolute disinformation with a clear and present threat to national security by instigating rebellion within the armed forces”.
The notice said Gill made “highly hateful and seditious” remarks tantamount to “incite armed forces towards revolt” during the said programme. It further said his statements violated Article 19 of the Constitution as well as Pemra laws, hence it was constrained to ban the channel’s transmission. It had sought a response from Mr Iqbal within three days, and also directed him to appear in person on Wednesday at Pemra’s Islamabad office along with a written reply.
Media, rights bodies condemn
Meanwhile, the Karachi Union of Journalists condemned Yousaf’s arrest. KUJ president Shahid Iqbal and general secretary Fahim Siddiqi urged the CJP to take suo motu notice of the suspension of ARY News service and Yousaf’s arrest.
The HRCP also opposed the “disruptions” to ARY News in a tweet. “Pemra must refrain from arbitrarily taking channels off the air and protect all media houses’ right to freedom of expression, responsibly exercised,” it posted on twitter.
The Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors (AEMEND) in a statement termed the actions by the authorities a serious threat to freedom of expression. 
The PFUJ’s Afzal Butt announced a joint protest of various journalist unions in front of Pemra headquarters. The Punjab Union of Journalists challenged the nationwide suspension of ARY News transmission and arrest of Yousaf.
Rana Azeem, secretary of another PFUJ faction, filed a petition before the Lahore High Court, stating the Pemra chairman had no right to shut down the transmission of any news channel before serving a notice. 
Another petition was filed before the Supreme Court’s Lahore registry against Yousaf’s arrest by Advocate Azhar Siddique, PUJ President Shahzad Butt, an ARY News reporter and members of the civil society.

3,"Senate body seeks briefing on gems, jewellery industry",FBR directed to brief committee over taxation rules application on gems and jewellery industry.,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Sub-Committee on Commerce directed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to brief the committee over taxation rules application on the gems and jewellery industry.
The committee meeting, chaired by Senator Fida Muhammad, also directed that members of the Sarafa Committee be called to give a holistic view of the industry. The committee reviewed the existing policies applicable to the industry.
The committee discussed various issues that challenged the industry, especially the policy on the import of gold into Pakistan, which is governed under the Entrustment and Self-Consignment Schemes. Under the scheme, a jeweller can export jewellery made from locally procured precious metals and gem stones and is allowed to realise 50 per cent of such export proceeds in the form of gold import.
The Ministry of Commerce (MoC) representative informed the committee that the ministry has been receiving representation from the gems and jewellery sector to review stringent policies to facilitate the sector. The ministry also received recommendations from the PM Task Force for Gems and Jewellery and the tax ombudsman regarding this matter. Accordingly, a gems and jewellery committee was formulated by the MoC to address the concerns. The panel consisted of representation from the commerce ministry, the FBR, the State Bank of Pakistan, and the Trade and Development Authority of Pakistan.
Proposals have been finalised for amendments, the committee was informed. 
The committee was informed that zero per cent duty is currently being charged, in addition to 17pc sales tax, which has also been reduced to encourage jewellers to join the tax net. Given the current economic situation of the country, the ministry recommended that imports of gold be curtailed until the dollar stabilises.

4,PTCL trials one terabit per second internet speed,"It's enough speed to download entire Game of Thrones in HD within 2 seconds and support 300,000 video zoom calls simultaneously.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) has conducted the country’s first trial of one-terabit — one trillion bits or pieces of binary data — transport capacity per wavelength, the company said in a press release on Wednesday.
The trial was conducted in collaboration with Nokia in a live network environment, where PTCL Metro Transport Network was upgraded to one terabit per channel, extending its capacity to extreme speeds of 32 terabits per fibre.
One terabit per second is enough bandwidth to download the entire Game of Thrones video series in HD in less than two seconds and support 300,000 HD video zoom calls simultaneously.
The trial was based on Nokia’s Photonic Service Engine Transport Technology, designed to maximise network capacity and provide better customer experience, with faster and higher bandwidth, the press release said.
“This pilot transformation will lead to transport network enablement for future technologies while creating new opportunities for industries as well as individuals,” it said. “This is yet another step on PTCL’s road map and resolve to prepare its network infrastructure for embracing the growing data traffic demands of high-speed services and bandwidth intensive applications, including ultra-HD video streaming, industrial automation, smart cities and e-learning platforms for its subscribers and enterprise customers.”
Jafar Khalid, the chief technology officer at PTCL Group, said digitising the customer experience would facilitate the ever-growing data traffic demand of corporate and consumer segments.
“Nokia’s modern technology and expertise has helped the PTCL to test bandwidths up to one terabit, that will help provide a superior customer experience and enable seamless future expansion of our transport network capacity across Pakistan,” Mr Khalid said.
The PTCL has said that the Flexgrid architecture allowed PTCL to modernise and upgrade its optical network to provide individuals and enterprises with “a fast and reliable network connectivity”.

The attackers hurled a grenade at the stall which exploded and injured five people, including a woman passing by.

8,Supreme Court cancels full court reference for Justice Sajjad Ali Shah,Reference was scheduled for Aug 11 to bid farewell to Justice Shah who is reaching superannuation on Aug 14.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Wednesday cancelled a full court reference earlier scheduled for Aug 11 to bid farewell to Justice Sajjad Ali Shah who is reaching superannuation on Aug 14.
According to an official handout, the full court reference scheduled in honour of Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah on Aug 11, has been cancelled on the request of the judge.
“Moreover, farewell dinner in honour of the judge has also been scaled down which shall now be held in Judges Colony on the request of Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah,” the press release said.
It is customary that the Supreme Court holds the full court reference consisting of all judges of the top court to eulogise the services rendered by outgoing judges.
In addition to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, speeches are also delivered at the full court reference by the outgoing judge, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP), Vice Chairman of Pakistan Bar Council and President of Supreme Court Bar Association. 
The reference is also attended by senior lawyers and family members of some of the judges.
After the references, the judges also interact with lawyers during tea outside the Courtroom No. 1 at the ceremonial hall. And in the evening the Supreme Court arranges a befitting dinner during which shields and bouquets were presented to outgoing judges followed by a sumptuous feast.
Currently AGP Ashtar Ausaf is unavailable and cannot attend the reference since he has just landed in the United Kingdom after having his medical treatment in the US. It is also a tradition that a senior or Additional Attorney General can be asked to represent the AGP by delivering his speech on the occasion.
Vice Chairman of PBC Hafeezur Rehman Chaudhry had come to the office of the council on Wednesday, but left the city soon after learning that the event has been cancelled.
Interestingly the leadership of the SCBA is on a 12-day pleasure ride to four European countries: France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. The delegation is being led by President of SCBA Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon.
When asked why the visit was planned on dates coincided with the full court reference, Mr Bhoon told Dawn that the visit had been scheduled much earlier, but dispelled the impression that the absence of the SCBA leadership has something to do with the Supreme Court’s rejection on July 25 the request of hearing Speaker of Punjab Assembly Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi’s plea by a full court consisting of all available judges.
Led by Latif Afridi, former presidents of the SCBA including Ahsan Bhoon had requested the top court to constitute a full court to hear the matter since the crisis had deepened, but the court rejected the plea.
“This is not a reaction,” Mr Bhoon said, adding what he felt was that the request to constitute the full court was made to provide the top court an opportunity of enhancing its dignity and prestige since “we believe that the interpretation done by the apex court in the presidential reference on Article 63A of the constitution that deals with the defection clause did not reflect sentiments of the people at large. Thus the full court reference was an attempt to provide the court the opportunity to undone what had been stated while interpreting the presidential reference,” he said.

9,SHC orders restoration of ARY News,Restrains Pemra from suspending or revoking channel's licence till Aug 17.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday directed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) and cable operators to immediately restore the transmission of ARY News.
The SHC also extended the time to respond to an impugned show-cause notice, issued by Pemra to the news channel, up to Aug 15 and restrained Pemra from suspending or revoking the licence of channel till Aug 17 after the channel’s counsel assured the court that PTI leader Shahbaz Gill would not be allowed to appear on the channel, subject to further court orders.
However, the single-judge bench headed by Justice Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan said that Pemra would be at liberty to consider the submissions of the channel upon submission of a suitable response to the show-cause notice and the plaintiff would be given fair opportunity to ensure that all legal requirements were fulfilled, but no final order be passed till Aug 17.
The counsel further undertook that the plaintiff would use extreme caution in respect of the individuals who have tendency of uttering certain words or express a stand point which may create basis of issuance of a similar show cause notice in the future. The bench issued these directives during a preliminary hearing of a lawsuit filed by the management of news channel impugning a show-cause notice issued by Pemra on Aug 8.
The lawyer for Pemra said the authority has not passed any order for banning the channel nor has issued any direction to any cable operator to remove the channel from the cable. The bench also issued notices to Pemra and other defendants as well as deputy attorney general for Aug 17.

10,Elahi advises PTI to distance itself from Gill’s remarks,"“This renewal of PTI’s relationship with the Pakistan Army is hurting the PML-N and PPP leaders,” he says.","LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Parvez Elahi has advised the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership to disassociate itself from the anti-army statement given by Shahbaz Gill, chief of staff to PTI chairman Imran Khan.
“I have given a statement against Shahbaz Gill’s tirade against Pakistan Army, which is an important national institution, and asked him whether he had gone out of his senses,” Mr Elahi stated in an interview to a news channel on Wednesday.
Mr Elahi asserted that Gill’s statement had done more damage than good and added that he had no right to go against the party policy. He said he and his son Moonis Elahi had convinced PTI chairman that there was no “step forward” without the support of Pakistan Army. He said the Pakistan Army was not only defending Pakistani borders but also first defence line against any natural calamity in the country.
In another interview to a news channel, the chief minister said Mr Khan had been convinced to mend relations with the army and matters were being sorted out. He said every Pakistani patriot was asking Imran Khan to keep cool relations with the army to achieve success. “Imran Khan has shown flexibility in this case and given a statement that any person, who gives statement against Pakistan Army was not a patriot Pakistani,” CM Elahi added.
“This renewal of PTI’s relationship with the Pakistan Army is hurting the PML-N and PPP leaders,” he claimed.
About Punjab government’s relationship with the federal government, Mr Elahi said he had neither spoken to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif nor would speak to him in future. However, he said, he had instructed the chief secretary and police chief to give due protocol to the prime minister and implement his orders in the province. He said he wanted the prime minister to reciprocrate and do the needful.

11,"Imran mastermind of anti-army campaign, alleges Marriyum",Claims those arrested in online drive probe following Lasbela copter crash have revealed campaign was started at Imran's behest.,"

Marriyum Aurangzeb

 
ISLAMABAD: While calling Shahbaz Gill’s comments on ARY News “outrageous,” Information Minis­ter Marriyum Aurangzeb on Wednesday alleged that the script read out by Mr Gill was actually written by PTI chairman Imran Khan. 
She addressed a press conference immediately after Mr Khan’s address in which he said that a conspiracy was afoot to “cut the PTI to size” and “pit the country’s largest political party against the army.”
“ARY News defied all journalistic requirements and aired it without any interruption,” the minister said while claiming that Mr Gill tried to incite a rebellion within the army and expressed disregard for those who lost their lives in the helicopter crash last week.
Ms Aurangzeb said that if there was anyone who was harming PTI, that was Mr Khan himself.
She added that Mr Khan was nervous because he had campaigned against the martyrs through his party’s social media trolls.
This information was revealed by those arrested by investigation agencies who were probing the malicious campaign against the martyrs following the crash, she claimed.
The social media trolls arrested by the agencies claimed that the campaign was launched at Mr Khan’s behest, she added.
She also claimed that ARY News has launched a campaign against the government “to sidetrack this issue”.
After damaging his own party and the country, Mr Khan was now trying to tarnish the reputation of the army, she said.
While referring to his address, Ms Aurangzeb said that fear and panic was visible on Mr Khan’s face as he repeatedly claimed that efforts were being made to place curbs on his party.
The minister said that Mr Khan’s entire politics was based on hatred, sedition, anarchy and hooliganism.
“This is the mentality of Imran Khan. He wants to set the country on fire and called for a rebellion within the army.”
