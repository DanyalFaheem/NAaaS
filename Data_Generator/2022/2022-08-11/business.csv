0,Miftah promises ‘hefty’ increase in dividends by SOEs,Stakeholders term capital gains tax unjust...,"KARACHI: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail promised that he would hold a meeting “immediately” with the relevant stakeholders to consider increasing the dividends of profitable state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
A press release issued by the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday said the bourse’s management and brokers who met the finance minister in the preceding week demanded that the payout of profitable SOEs be increased immediately.
“While some of the SOEs are extremely profitable, their payout ratio is a meagre 18 per cent,” the press release said. The meeting participants urged the finance minister that this should be raised to 50pc. Given the imminent board meetings, there was an urgency for guidance for the SOEs to declare healthy dividends, which would result in dividend income and taxation revenue for the government and give it fiscal space to reduce the circular debt as well, it said.
The participants also pointed out that the market valuations presented compelling opportunities for entities like State Life Insurance Corporation and the Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution to invest in listed companies for the benefit of their policyholders and pensioners.

Stakeholders term capital gains tax unjust

The participants emphasised that taxation measures should be equitable. Movements in the rupee-dollar exchange rate have been too volatile, and changes to this effect should be gradual, they said. With regard to interest rates, it was pointed out that these are negative in almost all countries, and the same fact must be taken into account in the national context.
The finance minister said macroeconomic stability was forthcoming with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme resuming before the end of August. “The balance-of-payments position is now well under control. With increased hydropower, lower energy demand and lower oil prices, Pakistan may even have a balance-of-payments surplus in coming months,” he said.
With regard to tax measures, the finance minister stated that the 10pc super tax is imposed for one year only while alternative revenue streams are being developed. Advances-to-deposits ratio-linked tax on banks will not be imposed retrospectively, and tax revenues from the retail sector are expected to be significantly higher than last year’s, he added.
The participants emphasised that the two biggest obstacles to the growth of capital markets are tax incentives given to other asset classes and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements in the stock market, which are not consistently applied to the other asset classes. These obstacles are resulting in an anti-money laundering and tax-driven distortion among asset classes, which is detrimental to the efficient allocation of scarce resources.
The meeting participants pointed out that even though the stock market is one of the most documented sectors of the economy, the income of listed companies is subject to double taxation — at the company level and later at the dividend-distribution level, whereas unincorporated businesses are subject to substantially lower taxes.
A key concern expressed at the meeting was the treatment of capital gains tax. The Finance Bill 2022 addressed this issue through the introduction of reduced rates based on the holding period. However, the final amended document again created a tax disparity between securities and immovable properties. The participants termed it unfair and against the stated policy of the government.
They emphasised that SOEs like SLIC and development finance institutions like Pak Kuwait Investment Company, as well as public-private partnerships and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects, be encouraged to list and raise debt in the capital market.

1,Govt notifies Rs3.5 per unit hike in base tariff,Power minister asks Punjab govt to revisit decision of removing time limit on businesses.,"ISLAMABAD:  Power Minister Khurram Dastgir Khan on Wednesday said the government  had notified Rs3.50 per unit increase in national base electricity  tariff and promised to investigate complaints of overbilling on account  of monthly fuel cost adjustments (FCAs) in the current bills.
Speaking  at a news conference, the minister said the federal government would  engage with Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi not to go ahead  with removing time restrictions on  businesses because energy conservation  was a national issue amid a multidimensional national challenge and  Punjab being the largest province was expected to play a lead role in  energy savings.
He hoped the Punjab chief minister would not pursue  an irresponsible policy once he was explained the ramifications of  increased electricity consumption. 
He was commenting on an announcement made by Mr Elahi to allow traders to open their businesses 24/7 if they so desired.

Power minister asks Punjab govt to revisit decision of removing time limit on businesses

He  said the government was already examining how to minimise the impact of  FCAs but hastened to add that the billing in August and September  months would remain at the current level and start declining every month  beginning November.
The minister conceded the power bills in July  were exorbitant owing to increased consumption and relatively higher  FCAs in May. Responding to a question, he agreed to investigate if  higher units had also been built into the billing for FCAs or for lack  of proper meter reading in April or May.
He said the government had  been waiting for end-June recoveries to be completed in July and now the  performance of power distribution companies (Discos) would be examined  and decisions to retain or change them would also be data-based.
Responding  to another question, Mr Khan said the government had removed recovery  of taxes from traders through electricity bills that would also provide  relief in higher tariffs and bills to some extent.

2,Musk sells nearly $7bn in Tesla stock,"WASHINGTON: Elon Musk has sold nearly $7 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to legal filings, amid a...","WASHINGTON: Elon Musk has sold nearly $7 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to legal filings, amid a high-stakes court battle with Twitter over a $44bn buyout deal.
The billionaire offloaded about 7.9 million shares in the electric carmaker between Aug 5 and 9, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday.
“In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don’t come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock,” Musk, the world’s richest man, said on Twitter late Tuesday.
The social media network is locked in a legal battle with the mercurial Tesla boss over his effort to walk away from the April agreement to buy the company, and a judge has ordered the trial to begin in October.
Musk has filed a countersuit, accusing Twitter of fraud and alleging the platform misled him about key aspects of its business before he agreed to a $44 billion deal.
The latest move comes after Musk sold around $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares in April as he was preparing to finance the Twitter deal. He tweeted at the time:  “No further TSLA sales planned after today.” Tesla had gained 2.2 percent to $868.34 by midday Wednesday, while Twitter jumped 3.4 percent to $44.28.
Musk has now sold about $32 billion worth of Tesla shares since November.
Dan Ives de Wedbush Securities said he thinks the Twitter purchase will go ahead in the end.
“Musk has now sold enough TSLA stock to fund the Twitter deal which looks more likely,” he told AFP.  “This selling pressure has been an overhang on Tesla’s stock and for now the pressure is gone as the agita is gone.”

3,Indian companies swapping dollar for Asian currencies to buy Russian coal,Move allows India to cut risk of breaching Western sanctions against Moscow.,"NEW DELHI: Indian companies are using Asian currencies more often to pay for Russian coal imports, according to customs documents and industry sources, avoiding the US dollar and cutting the risk of breaching Western sanctions against Moscow.
Reuters previously reported on a large Indian coal deal involving the Chinese yuan, but the customs data underline how non-dollar settlements are becoming commonplace.
India has aggressively stepped up purchases of Russian oil and coal since the war in Ukraine began, helping to cushion Moscow from the effects of sanctions and allowing New Delhi to secure raw materials at discounts compared to supplies from other countries.
Russia became India’s third-largest coal supplier in July, with imports rising by over a fifth compared with June to a record 2.06 million tonnes.
In June, Indian buyers paid for at least 742,000 tonnes of Russian coal using currencies other than the US dollar, according to a summary of deals compiled by a trade source based in India using customs documents and shared with Reuters, equal to 44pc of the 1.7 million of tonnes of Russian imports that month.
Indian steelmakers and cement manufacturers have bought Russian coal using the United Arab Emirates dirham, Hong Kong dollar, yuan and euro in recent weeks, according to customs documents separately reviewed by Reuters.
The yuan accounted for 31pc of the non-US dollar payments for Russian coal in June and the Hong Kong dollar for 28pc. The euro made up under a quarter and the Emirati dirham around one-sixth, the data from the trade source showed.
India’s Ministry of Finance, which administers the customs board, did not respond to emails seeking comments confirming the documents. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry declined to comment.
The Reserve Bank of India also did not respond to requests for comment.
The RBI has approved payments for commodities in the Indian rupee, a move it expects to boost bilateral trade with Russia in its currency.
The US dollar has been the dominant currency for Indian commodity imports, traders said, and the greenback makes up most of the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
For deals in a currency other than the dollar, lenders would potentially have to send dollars to bank branches in the country of the original currency, or banks they have tie-ups with, in exchange for that currency to settle the trade.
Keeping dollars at distance
Two traders based in India that purchase coal for domestic customers and a trader based in Europe who deals with Russian coal said they expected the share of non-dollar transactions for Russian coal to increase as banks and other parties explore ways of cushioning themselves against any further tightening of sanctions.
Buying Russian coal using the US dollar is not illegal for Indian firms.
Reuters was able to corroborate customs documents for four of the 11 vessels in the summary of Russian coal trades in June provided by the trade source, which showed payments made using the yuan, euro and the Emirati dirham, using ship-tracking data and by speaking to a private customs agent based in India.

4,ICI sells partial stake in NutriCo for $45m,ICI Pakistan will continue to hold about 24.5pc of the company’s shares after the transaction is over.,"KARACHI: ICI Pakistan Ltd, which will soon be formally renamed Lucky Core Industries Ltd, said on Wednesday its board has approved the sale of 26.5 per cent shares in its subsidiary NutriCo Morinaga to a Japanese investor at an aggregate price of $45 million or $2.07 per share.
Japan’s Morinaga Milk Industry Company Ltd will thus acquire a total shareholding of 33.3pc in the local company — which is engaged in the manufacturing and trading of infant and grown-up formula — from its existing shareholders, including ICI Pakistan Ltd that controls a 51pc stake.
ICI Pakistan will continue to hold about 24.5pc of the company’s shares after the transaction is over.
NutriCo Morinaga was established as a joint venture between ICI Pakistan, Morinaga Milk and Unibrands Ltd to locally manufacture and distribute nutritional formula products. 
Philip Morris earnings decline
Philip Morris Pakistan Ltd reported a profit of Rs383.4 million for April-June, down 61.7 per cent from a year ago. A regulatory filing showed the cigarette maker’s earnings for the first six months of 2022 remained Rs1.5 billion, down 11pc on a year-on-year basis.
A company statement attributed the decline to higher taxation in the shape of a super tax imposed at 10pc in the latest Finance Act.
The company’s net turnover in the six-month period was Rs10.16bn, up 10.2pc from a year ago. This included a domestic net turnover of Rs9.17bn, which went up 1.5pc on an annual basis. The export-related turnover increased more than 100pc to Rs991m, reflecting the delayed exports at the end of 2021 on account of external supply chain constraints.

The State Bank of Pakistan data showed that the rupee appreciated by 2.13 against the US currency compared to the previous close of Rs224.04.
In the open market, the dollar was traded at Rs218 compared to Rs222 the previous working day, a loss of Rs4 per dollar.
The rupee recovered Rs7.91pc or Rs18.03 against the dollar during the last seven sessions, gaining strength without an additional dollar supply. 
According to forex dealers, the massive decline in imports, which cut the trade deficit by 47 per cent in July FY23, was the main reason for the depreciation of the dollar.

6,Fertiliser makers call for direct subsidy scheme,"Lack of proper mechanism for subsidy distribution will impact all major agricultural crops, they warn.","ISLAMABAD: The advisory council of the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan (FMPAC) on Wednesday renewed its offer to support the federal government in formulating a workable direct subsidy scheme for farmers with a view to adequate use of fertilisers, leading to increased agricultural production in the country.
In a statement, the FMPAC advisory council regretted that the direct targeted subsidy scheme for farmers had been under consideration by the government to ensure that the desired benefit was passed on to small farmers. However, the government has not yet been able to pass on the benefit of the subsidy on expensive phosphate fertilisers to farmers across the country.
The advisory council is still awaiting a response to a letter it sent in June to Finance Minister Miftah Ismail. Back then, the council had offered to partner with the government to formulate a workable direct subsidy scheme. The lack of a proper mechanism for subsidy distribution will impact all the major agricultural crops, warned the FMPAC.
FMPAC Advisory Council Executive Director Brig (retd) Sher Shah Malik said that a significant drop in the use of phosphatic fertiliser has been witnessed due to unprecedented high prices and difficulties in importing due to restraints on foreign exchange. Failure of the government to subsidise the costly fertilisers has also contributed to the decline in the balanced use of fertilisers, he said.
He was concerned that the lack of a proper mechanism in place for subsidy distribution may have led to a drastic impact on the crops.
The Punjab government introduced a voucher-based SMS-enabled direct subsidy mechanism, but still the subsidy benefit could not be passed on to farmers, the statement said.
