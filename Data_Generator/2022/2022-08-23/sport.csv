England last toured in 2005, before Pakistan were forced to play international matches at neutral venues due to security concerns following an attack on a bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore in 2009. 
International cricket has gradually returned since 2015, but suffered another setback when New Zealand pulled out of a tour minutes before a one-day international was due to start in September last year, citing security alerts. 
A week later England scrapped tours to Pakistan by both its men’s and women’s teams. 
The PCB has worked hard to convince teams to visit the country again and Australia this year undertook their first tour of Pakistan in 24 years. 
England, who pulled out of a scheduled tour last year, will play seven Twenty20 Internationals beginning on Sept 20 on the first leg of the tour before heading home. 
They will return after the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia to play three Tests with the first scheduled to start in Rawalpindi on Dec 1. 
Multan hosts the second match from Dec 9 and the last Test begins in Karachi on Dec 17. 
“We are pleased that Pakistan and England test rivalry, which has historically produced close and tight matches, will return to our backyards in December,” PCB director Zakir Khan said in a statement. 
“Both the sides have evolved since they last played in Pakistan in 2005 and have recently been playing entertaining and exciting cricket. I remain confident this series will live up to the expectations of the global cricket fans who want to watch and enjoy competitive and thrilling matches.” 
Clare Connor, Interim Chief Executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, called it a “historic occasion”. 
“Pakistan cricket fans have waited for almost 17 years to see elite England players in action,” she said. “We have been working closely with the PCB over recent months and I am grateful to them for everything they have done, and continue to do, to make our Test and T20 tours a mouth-watering prospect for all involved.” 
The first Test will mark the first time England will play at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, where Pakistan have won five out of 12 matches. 
On their last tour of Pakistan, England lost the Multan Test — the hosts’ only loss in five matches at the venue — while it was England, who in 2000, ended Pakistan’s 34-Test unbeaten streak at the National Stadium in Karachi. 
Compared to the other two venues, the Multan Stadium is the farthest away from the city centre and will disrupt transport for the locals when the teams travel to and from the ground.  
PCB chairman Ramiz Raja has spoken about building accommodation close to the ground in Multan but a detailed plan hasn’t yet been unveiled. 
The three fixtures will count towards the ICC World Test Championship. Pakistan are currently fifth in the table and England seventh. 
Schedule: 
First Test: December 1-5 (Rawalpindi) 
Second Test: December 9-13 (Multan) 
Third Test: December 17-21 (Karachi)

1,Gill’s maiden ton propels India to ODI series clean sweep,Gill hammered 130 runs off 97 balls as India recovered from a slow start to score an imposing 289 for eight.,"HARARE: Shubman Gill struck a maiden One-day International century to steer India to a nervy 13-run victory over hosts Zimbabwe on Monday and complete a clean sweep of their three-match series at the Harare Sports Club.
Gill hammered 130 runs off 97 balls as India recovered from a slow start to score an imposing 289 for eight after winning the toss and electing to bat first, before bowling Zimbabwe out for 276 in the last over of the home side’s innings.
Gill not only wreaked havoc with the bat, he also caught Zimbabwe  centurion Sikandar Raza, who was threatening to give the home side a  shock victory. 
Zimbabwe were in the hunt all the way thanks to Raza’s sixth ODI century as he scored 115 from 95 balls, but when he fell in the penultimate over, their chances of a first victory over India since 2010 faded.
It was the closest outcome of the series after India won by 10 wickets in the opening clash on Thursday, followed by a five-wicket triumph with 146 balls remaining in Saturday’s second game.
Gill showed expert timing as he drove the home attack to all corners and quickly lifted the run rate after India were 84-2 in the 21st over.
He put on a 140-run partnership for the second wicket with Ishan Kishan, who scored 50, but after that watched a succession of partners depart cheaply as Brad Evans completed his first five-wicket haul in international cricket with figures of 5-54 in his 10 overs.
Zimbabwe’s Sean Williams showed aggressive intent in the homes team reply, scoring 45 runs off 46 balls, but at 169-7 they looked out of the contest.
That was until Raza and Evans (28) put on 104 for the eighth wicket to drag them back into it, but when they were out within five balls of each other with the victory line in sight, the tail could not deliver and a gallant run chase by Zimbabwe came up short. 
Seamer Avesh Khan, playing his second ODI, took the last wicket and was the pick of the visitors attack with 3-66, but while Shardul Thakur (1-55) was expensive, he claimed the prized wicket of Raza.

2,Hasnain to replace Shaheen in Pakistan’s  Asia Cup squad,LAHORE: Express pacer Mohammad Hasnain will replace injured fast bowler Shaheen Afridi in the Pakistan squad for the...,"LAHORE: Express pacer Mohammad Hasnain will replace injured fast bowler Shaheen Afridi in the Pakistan squad for the Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on Monday. 
Pakistan suffered a major blow at the weekend when pace spearhead Shaheen, who is recovering from a knee injury he suffered in Sri Lanka last month, was ruled out of the Twenty20 tournament and the following T20 international home series against England. 
Doctors advised Shaheen to rest for at least four to six weeks to fully recover from the injury. 
Hasnain, 22, will join the squad from England, where he is currently playing for Oval Invincibles in The Hundred tournament. The right-arm bowler has taken 17 wickets in 18 T20s and played his last T20 against the West Indies at Karachi in December 2021. 
Hasnain was banned from bowling internationally in January after his action was reported during a stint in Australia’s domestic Big Bash League, but was cleared to return in June after remodelling his action. 
He was again embroiled in controversy last week when Australian all-rounder Marcus Stoinis appeared to question the legality of his action during a match in The Hundred. Stoinis mimicked Hasnain’s bowling action with a throwing motion when he was walking back to the dugout after being caught by the fast bowler’s short pitched delivery. However, the Australian batter was not formally sanctioned. 
The Pakistan squad will reach the UAE later on Monday after winning the three-match one-day international series against the Netherlands. 
Meanwhile, Asif Ali, Haider Ali, Iftikhar Ahmed and Usman Qadir will leave for the UAE in the wee hours of Tuesday. They will replace Abdullah Shafique, Imam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Haris, Salman Ali Agha and Zahid Mehmood, who were part of the side that recorded a clean sweep against the Dutch. 
Former champions Pakistan begin their Asia Cup campaign in a blockbuster against arch-rivals India in Dubai on Sunday. 
Squad: Babar Azam (captain), Shadab Khan, Asif Ali, Fakhar Zaman, Haider Ali, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Hasnain, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Wasim Junior, Naseem Shah, Shahnawaz Dahani, Usman Qadir.

3,"Russell, Boult among Big Bash’s ‘Platinum’ dozen","Trent Boult is among the top players who will reportedly be paid $234,566 each, no matter how many matches they play.","MELBOURNE: Aust­ralia’s Big Bash League has unveiled 12 marquee players for the first round of Sunday’s draft, including 10 who are likely to exit the tournament before the halfway stage to play in other Twenty20 leagues that will run concurrently in January.
Big-hitting Andre Russell joined fellow West Indians Kieron Pollard and Dwayne Bravo in the list of  “Plat­inum” players up for grabs in the first round of the overseas draft, the league organisers annou­nced on Monday.
Trent Boult, who recently surrendered his central contract with New Zealand Cricket prioritising Twenty20 leagues, is among the top players who will reportedly be paid A$340,000 ($234,566) each, no matter how many matches they play.
The list includes five Englishmen, among them Jason Roy and Liam Living­stone, star Afghan spinner Rashid Khan and Pakistan’s Shadab Khan.
The eight-team league, which runs from Dec 13 to Feb 4, will vie for eyeballs with two new Twenty20 competitions in the United Arab Emirates and South Africa, both beginning in January.
Big Bash will also likely bid goodbye to 10 of these 12  “Platinum” players in late December as they have also signed up for one of the other two new leagues.
Struggling to retain its position in a crowded Twenty20 marketplace, Big Bash pulled off a major coup on Sunday when David Warner confirmed his first appearance in 10 seasons.
His Australia team mate Glenn Maxwell had no doubt it was a major boost for the eight-team league.
“We know any time we can get those guys back playing, that makes a better product and makes it a better spectacle for everyone,” the all-rounder told reporters.
“It’s someone all the crowd knows and they can get behind and Davey’s a superstar of the T20 format and someone that everyone loves watching.”   
“Hopefully (the draft) will reinvigorate a bit of life into it,” Maxwell added.

4,Bangladesh strip head coach Domingo of T20 role days before Asia Cup,DHAKA: Bangladesh stripped head coach Russell Domingo of his role overseeing the Twenty20 side and told him to focus...,"DHAKA: Bangladesh stripped head coach Russell Domingo of his role overseeing the Twenty20 side and told him to focus on Test and One-day International cricket, just days before the Asia Cup.
Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan said that former Indian cricketer Sridharan Sriram, named last week as the technical consultant, will look after the T20 side.
“Russell Domingo won’t be part of the T20 set-up. He will be with ODIs and Tests,” Nazmul told a press briefing in Dhaka.
“There’s no head coach” for the T20 side, he added.
“We have a batting coach, a spin coach, fast bowling coach and fielding coach. We also have the captain. We also have a technical consultant for T20s.
He will give the game plan,” he said.
Domingo, a 47-year-old South African, was appointed Bangladesh’s head coach in August 2019, initially on a two-year contract. The BCB last year extended it until November 2023.
But Bangladesh have struggled in T20s under Domingo, failing to win a game in the Super 12 stage of the World Cup in the United Arab Emirates last year.
They have won just two of their last 15 T20s and suffered their maiden series loss to Zimbabwe earlier this month.
Domingo said the BCB’s decision to separate the roles was a  “great” idea.
“It gives me nice focus on the Test match and 50-overs stuff,” he said.
“We have had some great results and bad results in T20s,” he said.  “I don’t think it is a bad idea to make a fresh approach in T20s.
“It is not about me,” he added.  “I am all for making the team better.” Bangladesh leave on Tuesday for the Asia Cup in the UAE, where they will compete in Group B alongside Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.
The tournament starts on Saturday.
All-rounder Shakib Al Hasan meanwhile said that he was more motivated than ever after being reappointed T20 skipper last week.
“I will try to help the team as much as possible with whatever experience I have,” Shakib told reporters.
“I believe we are a good side. If we can make the best use of our resources and we can do it once or twice, you will realise we have the ability.”
“Even if we lose a game, we should make sure to either drag the game into the final over or compete so that people can see we are improving.” Bangladesh will play a tri-nation tournament in New Zealand involving the hosts and Pakistan in October before they travel to Australia for the T20 World Cup.

5,Former Australia skipper Paine back in training,Paine was set to lead Australia into the home Ashes series last year until the sexting allegations became public.,"SYDNEY: Former Australia captain Tim Paine, who resigned after a sexting scandal last November and took an  “indefinite mental health break” from cricket, has ended his self-imposed exile and is back in training in Tasmania.
The 37-year-old wicket-keeper was omitted from Tasmania’s list of contracted players in May but was given the all-clear to train with the squad ahead of the new season.
“It was just great to see him come into my office and request permission to train,” Cricket Tasmania chief executive Dom Baker told The Australian newspaper.
“He started here as just a 16-year-old all those years ago and has been a part of our cricket ever since. He is training as an uncontracted player to get fit for club cricket, but if he proves to be anywhere near his best expect to see him playing state cricket again.
“All of Tasmania and I think most of Australia wants to see him finish his career on his own terms.”  
Paine was set to lead Australia into the home Ashes series last year until the sexting allegations became public. He stepped down and was replaced by Pat Cummins. The cricketer was accused by a former Cricket Tasmania receptionist of sending sexually explicit messages to her in 2017.
Paine, who said the texting was consensual, had been cleared by an internal Cricket Australia investigation in 2018 which was not revealed to the public until late last year.

6,Latham leads New Zealand to maiden ODI series win in WI,BRIDGETOWN: Stand-in captain Tom Latham top-scored with 69 to lead New Zealand to a series-clinching five-wicket...,"BRIDGETOWN: Stand-in captain Tom Latham top-scored with 69 to lead New Zealand to a series-clinching five-wicket victory over the West Indies in the third and final One-day International series in Barbados on Sunday.
Kyle Mayers’ second One-day century and a blistering 91 by captain Nicholas Pooran took the hosts to 301 for eight in their 50 overs.
But the Black Caps made light of an imposing target as four of the first five in their batting order scored half-centuries to reach 307 for five off 47.1 overs and underline their status as the top-ranked nation in the 50-over format.
New Zealand’s come-from-behind 2-1 win over the three matches was their first ODI series success in the Caribbean. It followed their 2-1 Twenty20 series triumph the previous week in Jamaica.
In the absence of injured regular captain Kane Williamson, Latham led the New Zealand effort and enjoyed a 120-run fourth-wicket partnership with Daryl Mitchell, who made 63, which tilted the contest in favour of the touring side.
“It’s nice to come here, where other teams have struggled in the past, and get the series win,” said player-of-the match Latham.
“It was a better wicket today and we knew the target. I am just happy to be able to make a contribution.” Opener Martin Guptill with 57 and Devon Conway, who plundered 56, also played key roles in the chase.
The West Indies cause was not helped by heavy dew on the outfield after dusk which required the ball to be changed four times during New Zealand’s innings and made it difficult for the home bowlers.
For the West Indies, Mayers’ 105 off 110 balls with 12 fours and three sixes dominated an opening stand of 173 with Shai Hope, who made 51.
But it was Pooran’s explosive 55-ball contribution, with nine sixes and four fours, that enabled the hosts to get beyond the 300-run mark.
“We missed our chance to take the series in that second game and paid the price here,” said a downbeat Pooran.
“We have a special bunch of guys here and I believe we will get better.” New Zealand spinner Mitchell Santner, who was named player of the series, claimed two for 38 in a containing 10-over spell while left-arm swing bowler Trent Boult was the leading wicket-taker with three for 53.
Jason Holder was the pick of the West Indies bowlers with two for 37 in seven overs.

7,PSG thrash Lille after Mbappe scores in record time,PARIS: Kylian Mbappe scored the fastest Ligue 1 goal for 30 years to set champions Paris St Germain on their way to ...,"PARIS: Kylian Mbappe scored the fastest Ligue 1 goal for 30 years to set champions Paris St Germain on their way to a runaway 7-1 victory at Lille on Sunday as they kept up their 100% start to the new Ligue 1 season. 
Mbappe took only eight seconds to lob the ball into the Lille net after being teed up by Lionel Messi, equalling the record set in 1992 by Michel Rio for Caen against Cannes. 
Mbappe then hit a post when facing an open goal, but Messi, Achraf Hakimi and Neymar all scored before half-time as PSG tore apart the only other club to win the French title in the last five seasons. 
Stories of tensions between two of PSG’s superstars, Mbappe and Neymar, had swirled around the club this week but the Brazilian scored twice and Mbappe three times. 
“It’s a real satisfaction to see them happy on the field, playing for each other,” PSG coach Christophe Galtier said. “Obviously there is talent, and when this talent comes together, it makes for a very enjoyable match.” 
Neymar added a fifth early in the second half. After Jonathan Bamba replied for Lille, Mbappe struck twice, set up both times by Neymar. 
PSG have scored 17 goals in winning their first three games of the season and are two points above Racing Lens and Olympique de Marseille, both winners on Saturday. 
Sunday also saw home success for Clermont and Stade Rennes and wins away for Auxerre and Stade Brest as they both marked their first victories of the new campaign. 
The weekend also saw a total of 11 red cards for the first time in 30 years, including four as newly promoted Auxerre won 2-1 at Montpellier as both sides ended down to nine men. 
Angers had Halid Sabanovic sent off after 34 minutes, after which Brest took advantage to win 3-1 with a double from Jeremy Le Douaron. 
Saif-Eddine Khaoui scored past Kasper Schmeichel in the sixth minute as Clermont beat Nice 1-0 at home to move up to fifth in the standings. Nice had Mario Lemina sent off for a bad tackle and then Jean-Clair Todibo for dissent in the last 10 minutes of the game. 
Rennes also won their first game of the season as they had the upper hand over Ajaccio with goals from Martin Terrier and Arthur Theate on either side of Mounaim El Idrissys score for the Corsican club. 
Toulouse fought back to draw 2-2 at home against Lorient after falling behind as early as the second minute.

8,Lewandowski’s first Barca goals see off Sociedad,MADRID: Robert Lewandowski got off the mark for Barcelona with a double as Ansu Fati starred as a substitute in a ...,"MADRID: Robert Lewandowski got off the mark for Barcelona with a double as Ansu Fati starred as a substitute in a 4-1 victory over Real Sociedad on Sunday, while Villarreal won at Atletico Madrid.
Poland striker Lewandowski, celebrating his 34th birthday, put Barca ahead inside 50 seconds before Alexander Isak levelled for La Real in San Sebastian.
But Fati came off the bench to create goals for Ousmane Dembele and Lewandowski, before completing the scoring himself.
Barca’s first win of the season followed a disappointing goalless draw at home to Rayo Vallecano on the opening weekend.
Coach Xavi had called for  “patience” from supporters after a summer spending spree which saw Lewandowski, Raphinha, Andreas Christensen and Franck Kessie all move to the Camp Nou.
That quartet all made their debuts against Rayo, but France defender Jules Kounde is still to be registered by the club after his transfer from Sevilla as they look to overcome financial problems.
The visitors made a dream start on Sunday, though, as 18-year-old full-back Alejandro Balde raced clear and sent in a low cross which was tapped home by Lewandowski.
He scored 344 goals during a trophy-laden eight-year spell at Bayern Munich before leaving for 45 million euros in July.
But the home side hit back in the sixth minute, as Frenkie de Jong lost the ball in midfield and Isak raced clear before lofting the ball into the net.
Sociedad were proving a tough nut to crack for Barca, but the game changed when Fati was sent on in the 64th minute.
The 19-year-old’s brilliant backheel teed up Dembele to drill a left-footed strike into the bottom corner just two minutes later, before another clever touch found Lewandowski to score.
Fati, who endured two injury-plagued seasons after breaking into the first team in 2019/20, got a goal himself late on as he collected Lewandowski’s volleyed flick and slotted in.
VILLARREAL DOWN ATLETICO
Earlier, Villarreal moved to the top of the fledgling table as second-half goals from Yeremy Pino and Gerard Moreno secured a 2-0 victory at Atletico Madrid.
Unai Emery’s men opened their season with an impressive 3-0 win at Real Valladolid last weekend but the scalp of Atletico will raise hopes of a possible challenge for Champions League qualification.
The result was a reality check for the capital side, though, who had also started the campaign with a 3-0 success at Getafe.
Villarreal, who reached last season’s Champions League semi-finals, are one of four teams with two wins from two matches and edged above reigning champions Real Madrid on goal difference.
The away side made a fast start at the Estadio Metropolitano, with Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak forced into fine saves from Giovani Lo Celso and Etienne Capoue.
Moreno thought he had given Villarreal a half-time lead, but his effort was ruled out for a handball.
Matheus Cunha was introduced midway through the second period by home coach Diego Simeone in place of Alvaro Morata and almost broke the deadlock in the 72nd minute, only to be denied by ‘keeper Geronimo Rulli.
Teenage winger Pino instead put Villarreal in front just a minute later, capitalising on a poor clearance to fire a fine low shot into the bottom corner.
Atletico’s Nahuel Molina was sent off deep into injury-time and Moreno netted in the 97th minute to send Villarreal top.

On the comeback trail after undergoing right shoulder surgery last year, Coric returned to the ATP Tour in March and after eight months on the sidelines was back in the winner’s circle claiming the biggest title of his career. 
Ranked 152 and in the tournament via a protected ranking, Coric capped a remarkable week, that included a second round victory over Rafa Nadal, with a brilliant final that no doubt marks the 25-year-old Croatian as a dark horse contender when play gets underway at Flushing Meadows on Aug 29. 
The title was the third of Coric’s career but his first since 2018 and will see him jump up the rankings to world number 29 on Monday and seeded at the US Open. 
“I have no words, to be honest. It’s just an unbelievable feeling,” Coric told a news conference after his victory. “I’m just gonna enjoy this. 
“I thought I could play well. I was training hard, and I knew I could play good tennis, but to play this level of tennis — I was just not aware. I’m just super happy, obviously”. 
Coric improved to 2-1 all-time against Tsitsipas, having retired from their first meeting in Rome in 2018 and won in the third round of the 2020 US Open in a fifth-set tiebreaker. 
Tsitsipas is still seeking a first title on outdoor hardcourt losing six finals played on cement. 
“It kind of sucks,” the Greek said. “I still hope to come back here and win it one day. I was definitely not choking — I just played robots every time in finals.” 
GARCIA GOES FROM QUALIFIER TO CHAMPION
In the women’s final, Caroline Garcia capped a long week by beating Petra Kvitova 6-2, 6-4 to become the first qualifier to win a WTA Tour 1000 tournament. 
After battling through qualifying, Garcia beat three top-10 world-ranked opponents, Maria Sakkari, Aryna Sabalenka and Jessica Pegula, on the way to the final where she delivered a master class against Czech Kvitova, the twice Wimbledon champion. 
Leading the WTA Tour in aces and second in break points saved, the 28-year-old Frenchwoman relied on her big weapons to clinch her third title of the season, sending down 11 aces and saving all eight break points she faced. 
Since coming back from a foot injury in May, Garcia has won three events on three different surfaces, on clay in Warsaw, where she beat world number one Iga Swiatek, grass in Bad Homburg and hardcourt in Cincinnati. 
“Pure joy, just happiness,” she said. “Every single win is very important. It’s always very hard to describe. It doesn’t happen so often and you have to really enjoy it. I’m grateful for this great week of tennis, and to win another title, it’s very special.” 
Kvitova was playing the 40th final of her career and looking for a 30th title. 
“It was definitely not the result I wanted, but if someone had told me I would be in the final I would be very happy,” said Kvitova. “I didn’t win the bigger trophy, but she really played very, very well.”

The horse from the Thunder family who finished off the frame in his last outing on May 22, looks fancied to overcome the challenge from half-a-dozen contenders and return to winning ways in the cup race under scale order I, II and III.
The race which is also the day’s feature event, will go over four furlongs.
Thunder Smile is likely to be chased by bay horse Waris while colt King’s Ransom can bring an element of surprise.
Bay horse Thunder Strike who completed his hat-trick in last outing looks smart to dominate the fifth and supporting race under scale order V to be contested over four furlongs.
Mare New Market should follow in the footsteps of Thunder Strike for the second place. If backed by connection, chestnut horse Justify can upset the applecart.
Dark bay mare Sweet Sonia, formerly Stayin’ Alive, is on chance to rule the opening race under lowest scale order VIII being run over four furlongs.
Sweet Sonia may be challenged by another mare Sheba. However, chestnut mare Soldier Girl can pull off an upset.
Bay horse Epsom is tipped to oblige punters by making amends of his successive losses by capturing the second race under scale order VII which will go over four furlongs.
Bay horse Deewana, who failed to finish on the board in his last two outings, may grab second place. If on job, chestnut horse Geo Channa can create quite a stir by getting the better of entire field.
Dark bay mare Little Darling should win honours in the third race classified under scale order VI and VII.
Either of the three horses namely Stella, Baba Champion and Denzo who belong to same connection can secure a place.    
A pair of horses — dark bay horse Zayan and chestnut horse Galactic Choice — will make their debut in the first and second race respectively.
Altogether, 35 horses — seven in each race — will be seen in action barring last-minute withdrawals, if any. The first race starts at 3pm.

11,Bennacer goal saves point for Milan at Atalanta,MILAN: Italian champions AC Milan came away from a tough Serie A encounter at Atalanta with a hard-earned 1-1 draw ...,"MILAN: Italian champions AC Milan came away from a tough Serie A encounter at Atalanta with a hard-earned 1-1 draw on Sunday as Ismael Bennacer cancelled out an early goal by the hosts in Bergamo.
After an even start to the match, Atalanta midfielder Ruslan Malinovskyi broke the deadlock in the 29th minute with a powerful left-foot finish from the edge of the box. Milan midfielder Bennacer scored the equaliser from a corner by Alexis Saelemaekers in the 68th minute, shooting through the Atalanta defenders and into the net off the post. 
Milan dominated possession and had more attempts on goal but failed to make them count. 
“I think we could have done better, we could have tried to win this match. It was difficult to find room, Atalanta were compact,” Bennacer told DAZN. 
The hosts were pleased with their performance. 
“We played against the Italian champions and we need to be satisfied. We start again from here and we have proven that we can play at this level against the strongest also this year,” Atalanta midfielder Mario Pasalic told DAZN. 
Winger Khvicha Kvarat­skhelia scored twice as hosts Napoli breezed past Serie A rookies Monza 4-0 earlier on Sunday to secure their second win of the season.  
Kvaratskhelia struck in each half of a stroll at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, with Victor Osimhen netting the hosts’ second on the stroke of half-time and Kim Min-jae heading home his first goal for the club late on. 
Empoli and Fiorentina held each other to a goalless draw while Bologna drew 1-1 with Verona with goals from Marko Arnautovic and Thomas Henry respectively.

Usyk retained his WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO heavyweight titles with a split-decision win over Anthony Joshua on Saturday, before calling out WBC heavyweight champion Fury in a post-fight interview.
Fury has declared himself retired, but said in a post on social media shortly after the match that he  “is here to stay.”   “He and Usyk would be a really good fight,” Warren told the BBC on Monday.  “It’s a fight that I think will be made because both teams would like to see that happen.
“Usyk said after the fight that it’s the only fight he’s interested in, and it’s certainly the same case with Tyson. It’s just a matter of where it will generate the most income because it’s a unique fight, a historic fight.
“It’s the first time for God knows how long that the four belts are on the line. Both fighters are undefeated. The whole world of boxing will be captivated by this fight.”  Warren added that an all-British showdown between Fury and Joshua could take place in the future, but said Joshua would need to return to winning ways to make it happen.
“If AJ manages to get a couple of wins under his belt — and I believe Tyson will beat Usyk — that may be a fight to be made,” Warren said.
“But AJ’s got to re-establish himself before you can even think about fights like that.”

Trained by Rashid Latif and rode by jockey Safdar Hussain, the five to four favourite son of Mazdhar, beat bay colt Mera Gondal by five lengths under floodlights. Filly Queen’s Gambit finished third close on heels while Lucky Sohna edged the frame among seven runners in this fourth race of the day. 
The supporting feature cup race, the Champion Jockey Shahid Rehman Cup was won by chestnut mare Safdar Princess, who avenged her two consecutive defeats in the process to occupy the winner’s box. 
Ridden by Safdar, the winner was sent out by trainer Tanveer Aslam in the second race in racing order.
In the Champion Jockey Salahuddin Cup, grey colt One Ten edged out bay colt Hard Target to give riding boy Nafeel Aamir his first win of the season. It was a unique co-incidence that Hard Target was ridden by Nafeel’s brother Abdullah Aamir. 
The race-goers witnessed a close competition resulting in a neck’s verdict in favour of gelding Danial Prince, who beat bay colt Khareef One with the colt Chhota Pathan third.
Bay colt Codes Cracker registered a facile victory in the fifth race — the Conflict Plate Class VII division 11 and 111. It was a surprising performance by the horse, who had finished out of the frame on his last run and was fancied for a place. 
Public fancy dark-bay horse Wind Talker won by a short-head in a photo-finish in the sixth and the last race to give the favourite backers an edge.
Meanwhile, a notification issued by the Lahore Race Club said two-year-old thoroughbred colts and fillies will be entitled to take part in class VII division 11 races from August 28. Those desirous to run their colts or fillies should submit their entries forthwith.

14,Mane double as imperious Bayern crush Bochum,"BOCHUM: Champions Bayern Munich demolished hosts VfL Bochum 7-0 on Sunday, with new signing Sadio Mane scoring ...","BOCHUM: Champions Bayern Munich demolished hosts VfL Bochum 7-0 on Sunday, with new signing Sadio Mane scoring twice, to maintain their perfect start to the season. 
The Bavarians are two points clear at the top with nine points from three league games, and have now scored a league-record 15 goals in their three games even though top striker Robert Lewandowski left this season to join Barcelona. 
On Sunday they went on a first-half rampage, scoring four times in 38 minutes to kill off the game. 
“We wanted to make sure in the opening 30 minutes the opponent knew it would be a tough match,” Bayern Coach Julian Nagelsmann told a news conference. “We are not setting ourselves any limit and are trying to deliver performances such as these as well. 
“The energy currently in the team was not always there in such a way last season. That’s something very comfortable to know. In the second half we still tried to win the game and solidify our plays. 
“It’s early in the season. We have played dominant matches so far, but there are always things to improve. Every player played really well. It won’t be easy picking a team for next weekend.” 
The visitors took a fourth-minute lead through Leroy Sane with their first attack of the game, and new signing Matthijs de Ligt got onto the scoresheet with his first ever effort on goal for Bayern, heading in a corner at the far post in the 25th. 
Kingsley Coman’s shot from close range after Bochum failed to clear just past the half-hour mark made it 3-0 and all but put the game beyond doubt, before Mane completed the first-half frenzy with his second goal of the season - a low shot from a tight angle in the 42nd. 
Bayern eased off the gas after the break, but the Senegal international added another with a penalty on the hour. 
Cristian Gamboa, under pressure from Sane, scored an own goal, piling further misery on the hosts who then saw substitute Serge Gnabry make it look so easy when he thundered in a low shot off the post to make it 7-0. 
Elsewhere, Eintracht Frankfurt’s winless start to the season continued as the Europa League holders drew 1-1 at home to Cologne. 
Frankfurt, who will play in the Champions League this season for the first time since losing the 1960 European Cup final to Real Madrid, now have two points from their opening three Bundesliga games.
