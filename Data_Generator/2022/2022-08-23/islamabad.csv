0,"24 varsities lack filtration plants on campuses, NA body told",Committee seeks action against institutions failing to provide safe drinking water to students; takes notice,"ISLAMABAD: The National  Assembly Standing Committee on Government Assurances was informed on Monday that 24 public-sector universities did not have filtration plants on their campus to provide safe drinking water to students.
In 2018, the National Assembly had directed all public and private-sector universities to ensure installation of filtration plants. However, 24 public-sector universities still lack this facility for students.
The Higher Education Commission (HEC) officials failed to give a satisfactory reply to the parliamentary panel about filtration plant facility in private universities.
The issue was taken up by the standing committee, which met at the Parliament House with MNA Mohammad Afzal Khokhar in the chair.

Committee seeks action against institutions failing to provide safe drinking water to students; takes notice of delay in development of E-12, I-15

The committee was also informed that 30pc of the diseases in the country were due to polluted water.
Similarly, 40pc of the citizens lose lives due to diseases caused by contaminated water. So, the provision of safe drinking water is necessary.
The committee was briefed by representatives of the Higher Education Commission regarding filtration plants in universities.
The committee was informed that on Sept 18, 2018, the National Assembly resolved that water filtration plants should be installed in all of government and private universities.
As many as 59 universities requested for financial assistance for installation of safe drinking water facilities for students.
The HEC submitted a PC-I to the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives for provision of safe drinking water in 59 government universities but the ministry turned down the summary because according to it, every university could afford a small amount of Rs3 million to provide safe drinking water facility to its students.
As a result, 35 more universities installed the water filtration plants, with 24 higher education institutions left that have still not made necessary arrangements for installing the plants. 
The HEC hoped that they would pursue for installation of water filtration plants and in the near future all public-sector universities would ensure provision of safe drinking water.
When the standing committee asked about the situation in private universities with regards to provision of safe drinking water, the HEC failed to provide a satisfactory reply.
The committee directed that complete list of government and private universities with respect to safe drinking water should be provided to it and action taken against those institutions that fail to provide safe drinking water to the students before the next meeting.
Earlier, while discussing another agenda item, the committee took serious notice of the delay in development of sectors E-12 and I-15 and directed that work on both sectors should be completed forthwith and plots handed over to the allottees.
Meanwhile, the committee was informed that employees of Islamabad police, security departments and other ministries/divisions/departments who served in the budget sessions were being granted honorarium for the last several years.
All other departments have paid complete or partial honorarium to its employees but the police department and other security departments did not pay anything to their employees.
The committee directed that the honoraria be paid to the employees of ICT police and other security departments and that the interior secretary and IGP should attend the next meeting in person and submit the compliance report.

3,Three Wasa projects on back-burner as govt fails to release funds,RAWALPINDI: The government has still not released funds for three main projects of the Water and Sanitation Agency...,"RAWALPINDI: The government has still not released funds for three main projects of the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) allocated in the annual development programme and if not released timely, work on them may be delayed.
The government had, in the programme, included three main projects for improvement of the water system in the garrison city.
Total costs of the projects are Rs3.9 billion for the construction of four sewage treatment plants and sewerage lines, Rs900 million for establishment of a water supply system and filtration plant to bring water from Daducha Dam and Rs490 million for rehabilitation of Rawal Lake Treatment Plant and replacement of old transmission pipe and water testing laboratory.
A senior Wasa official said the government allocated Rs10 million for the construction of four sewage treatment plants and sewerage lines in this fiscal year, Rs200 million was allocated for land acquisition for establishment of water supply system and filtration plant to bring water from Daducha Dam and Rs50 million for rehabilitation of Rawal Lake Treatment Plant and replacement of old transmission pipe and water testing laboratory.
He said that if the government released funds late then it would be difficult to complete these projects before next summer and people would face water shortage next year.
He said Wasa asked the government to release the funds as soon as possible so work would be started on these three main projects, adding Wasa was also facing financial crises and would not able to start work from the income generated by the agency through water and sewerage bills.
He said that after increase in the electricity charges, the agency had to spend more money to keep tube wells and water filtration plants in running condition. 
He said that there was dire need to restore the old water supply line from Rawal Dam to the city area to provide clean water to the residents of the garrison city to avoid water shortage. 
He said that the establishment of Daducha Dam water supply system would take more than a year and it would be started as soon as possible otherwise, the project would likely be delayed for a year more. When contacted, Wasa spokesman Umer Farooq said that the agency was working on launching the projects and in this regard, it completed all the homework. As soon as funds are released, the work would be started, he said.
He said the government would soon release the money and the agency would start the work.

4,Women accused should be granted bail as rule irrespective of offence: SC,Observation comes in judgement on appeal against rejection of bail plea of maid arrested in house robbery.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday held that bail should be granted to women accused as a rule irrespective of the category of offence, but in case of refusal then it should be an exception.
“In cases of women, as mentioned in the first proviso to Section 497(1), irrespective of the category of the offence, bail is to be granted as a rule and refused as an exception in the same manner as it is granted or refused in offences that do not fall within the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) CrPC,” observed Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah in a judgment he wrote.
Section 497 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) deals with the bail in cases of non-bailable offence and says: (1) when any person accused of any non-bailable offence was arrested or detained without warrant by an officer-in-charge of a police station, or appears or is brought before a court, he may be released on bail. But he shall not be so released if there appears reasonable grounds for believing that he has been guilty of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life or imprisonment for 10 years; provided that the court may direct that any person under the age of 16 years or any woman or any sick or infirm person accused of such an offence be released on bail.
Justice Shah was a member of the two-judge Supreme Court bench, headed by Justice Qazi Faez Isa, which had taken up an appeal of Tahira Batool against the June 6, 2022, denial of post-arrest bail to her by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).

Observation comes in judgement on appeal against rejection of bail plea of maid arrested in house robbery

She was booked in a December 16, 2021, case registered at the police station of Loi Bher, Islamabad. According to the FIR, five unknown people entered the house of the complainant, forcibly detained him and his family along with their maid (Tahira Batool). They robbed the family of cash, jewellery, mobile phones and also took away the maid with them.
Through a supplementary statement made the same day, the complainant implicated the petitioner as a partner of the five suspects.
During the hearing, Advocate Mohammad Shahzad Siddiqui, the counsel for the petitioner, argued that in the crime report one Sidra was mentioned as being the maid in the house of the complainant and detained along with his family. There is no material on the record to show that the petitioner (Tahira Batool) was the maid.
Besides, according to the crime report, the maid (Sidra) had not been ascribed any role in the commission of robbery.
Advocate General Islamabad Jahnagir Khan Jadoon on behalf of the prosecution contended that the petitioner was in league with other co-accused who had committed the robbery in the house and some of the stolen items such as artificial jewellery and two mobile phones had been recovered from her.
The apex court in its order observed that being a woman the petitioner’s prayer for post-arrest bail should have been examined under the first proviso to Section 497(1) CrPC if she was not found entitled to bail under Section 497(2) of CrPC.
“The courts below have not adverted to it. Thus, the interest of justice requires the Supreme Court has to examine it,” the judgment explained, adding Section 497(1) CrPC which prohibits the grant of bail in certain offences was popularly known as the prohibitory clause and such accused was presumed innocent until proved guilty and bail cannot be withheld as punishment without conviction.
The court said it had examined the record of the case and did not find any material that would attract any exceptions in order to refuse bail to the petitioner.
“We are cognizant of the fact that the persons involved in the commission of offences of robbery or dacoity are usually the professional criminals and there is a likelihood that they would repeat the offence if enlarged on bail,” the order said.
“But the case of the present petitioner is distinguishable as she was working as a maid in the house of the complainant as per his own version; therefore, she does not appear to be a professional robber or dacoit and we do not find a likelihood of her repeating the offence if released on bail.”
The IHC order is, thus, not sustainable under the law and calls for interference by the apex court, the judgment said, adding the petition is converted into an appeal and the IHC order set aside.
The petitioner is also admitted to post-arrest bail subject to her furnishing bail bond worth Rs50,000 with two sureties in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial court, the order said.
But the concession of bail may be cancelled by the competent court under Section 497(5) CrPC if she misuses it in any manner, including causing delay in the expeditious conclusion of the trial, the order added.

5,Attock residents protest against inflated electricity bills,TAXILA: People from different parts of Attock staged a protest on Monday against the Islamabad Electric Supply...,"TAXILA: People from different parts of Attock staged a protest on Monday against the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco) for issuing inflated electricity bills.
The protesters blocked Attock-Kamra Road, Mirza Road and Awan Sharif Road and also burnt electricity bills. They said the government must abolish all “cruel” taxes included in the electricity bill. 
The protesters, while carrying and showing their bills, chanted slogans against the PML-N government for damaging their businesses through unfair taxes. 
“We reject the imposition of this huge and forced sales tax imposed on us through electricity bills,” said Mohammad Ramzan.
“Please stop assassinating us economically; stop such tactics of receiving unjustified tax from us,” another protester Rasheeda Bibi said, adding that the government had made the lives of people miserable. 
Last year in August, the power bill was around Rs10,000 and now it is more than Rs22,000. There will be nothing left for the family if people are made to pay an excessive amount of power bills, she added.
Consumers of Hazro staged protest demonstrations outside the offices of Iesco for several hours. Later, they dispersed peacefully after assurance from Iesco authorities that their issues would be resolved.
Members of the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) local chapter also staged a protest demonstration in Taxila chowk. They were carrying banners and placards inscribed with slogans against the rising electricity charges. 
On this occasion, slogans were raised against the federal and provincial governments which, they said, have badly failed to give relief to poor people of the province.
Addressing protesters, local JI leader Attiqur Rehman urged the government to immediately withdraw taxes and fuel price adjustments from electricity bills. He said the incumbent government was dancing to the tunes of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and over-burdening people with taxes.

Cheema claims federal govt conspiring to pit institutions, citizens against each other

He said Shehbaz Gill was meted out mental and physical torture. 
He said the purpose of the two-day extension to the physical remand of Mr Gill was to get a statement of their choice from him through violence.
He said the PTI and PML-Q had formed the government in Punjab only a few days ago and they were dedicated to the service and welfare of the people. 
He said spokespersons of the federal government had nothing to work with except making false and baseless accusations day and night while people’s lives had become miserable due to inflation, mismanagement and injustice.
The adviser said the federal government had no policy to give relief to the people except filing false cases against the PTI chief and his associates.

12,PM asked to amend journalists’ protection law,"Meeting participated by representatives of media workers, journalists, HR bodies","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Journalists Safety Coalition (PJSC) has declared the ‘Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals Act 2021’ passed by the previous government as “fundamentally flawed” in some respects and urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to amend the law to make it optimally beneficial for stakeholders.
This unanimous demand was made during a meeting of the coalition, which brings together representative associations of media workers, senior journalists, human rights commissions, digital rights groups, female journalists and political parties, says a press release issued on Monday.
It was highlighted in the meeting that section 6 of the law mandates proof of “good faith” before it can benefit journalists. 
The meeting’s participants said this was akin to a pre-qualification clause, which was anathematic to press freedom and principles of lawmaking. Journalists, media bodies and civil society have been demanding removal of this clause.

Meeting participated by representatives of media workers, journalists, HR bodies

Furthermore, participants of the meeting raised concern about how the law was “gender blind” in terms of its failure to mandate a minimum number of women to the proposed Safety Commission that is to be set up under the law and demanded that an amendment should mandate that at least 25pc members of the commission be women to make it a progressive law.
“We unanimously demand the Shehbaz Sharif government to make these amendments on an urgent basis to convert what is a law good in intent but bad in draft, and hence misplaced in functionality, so that journalists can benefit from the law,” the statement said.
The law was passed by the current parliament in late 2021 with unanimous support of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Pakistan Peoples Party, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and other parties but section 20 was sneaked into the draft by the previous government rendering it practically redundant.
The government has also been urged to be consultative rather than secretive in the process. 
A panel of three names must be picked out by the prime minister for chairperson of the Safety Commission, which must include at least one woman.
Among those who attended the meeting were legal expert Aftab Alam, Farhatullah Babar, senior journalist Hamid Mir, National Press Club President Anwar Raza, Myra Imran of the Women Journalists Association of Pakistan, chairman of Digital Media Alliance of Pakistan Sabookh Syed, media analyst Adnan Rehmat and Iqbal Khattak.
One minute of silence was also observed to pay homage to two legendary journalists and founding members of PJSC - the late I.A. Rehman and late Mohammad Ziauddin – who championed the cause of journalists’ safety and protection. 
The meeting unanimously elected Hamid Mir as the coalition’s chairperson after the demise of its founding chair Mohammad Ziauddin.
