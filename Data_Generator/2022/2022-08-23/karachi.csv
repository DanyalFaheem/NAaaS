0,"Muttahida, PPP pleas against Imran’s papers dismissed",KARACHI: An appellate by-election tribunal of the Sindh High Court on Monday dismissed two appeals against ...,"KARACHI: An appellate by-election tribunal of the Sindh High Court on Monday dismissed two appeals against acceptance of the candidature of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman and former prime minister Imran Khan from a National Assembly constituency, NA-246, in Lyari.
The tribunal headed by Justice Adnan Iqbal Chaudhry observed that the appeals were meritless and dismissed in limine.
Two candidates of the Pakistan Peoples Party and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan Mohammad Jawed and Syed Tayyeb Hussain Hashmi filed appeals against the order passed by the returning officer rejecting their objections and accepting the nomination form of the PTI chief.
The lawyers for appellants argued that the declaration signed by Mr Khan about bank account for the purpose of election expenses was incomplete inasmuch as the account number and the name of bank had been left unfilled while he did not annex with his affidavit a copy of tax returns for the year 2021.
They further contended that the PTI chief’s net assets had increased from the previous financial year, but his tax returns did not justify such increase.
They maintained that he had also not disclosed the cost incurred on his foreign travels.
The tribunal in its order said that at the same time it was not being disputed that Form-B filed by Mr Khan listed four bank accounts and any of which may well be an account maintained for election expenses while it was also not disputed that he had in fact filed a tax return for the year 2021.
“No material is placed on the record to substantiate the averment that tax returns are false, or that any asset has been suppressed in Form-B. The affidavit of the candidate is that in the period of three years he made three foreign trips all as head of state and none in his private capacity,” it added 
The order further stated that it appeared to be sufficient disclosure of foreign travels especially when it was not being alleged that there were undisclosed overseas trips and therefore, none of these objections were substantial.
It observed that while filing written objections before the RO, appellants had only vaguely pleaded that candidate had suppressed information and objections now being urged were never pleaded specifically.

2,Cloud of uncertainty hangs over second phase of Sindh local govt elections,As many as 10 deputy commissioners approach ECP for postponement of Aug 28 polls in view of rain destruction.,"HYDERABAD/KARACHI: Less than a week before the date of polling for the second phase of local government elections in Sindh, deputy commissioners of as many as 10 districts in Hyderabad and Karachi divisions approached the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) asking them either to postpone the electoral process or review the situation due to devastation caused by torrential rains, it emerged on Monday.
Polling is due to be held on Aug 28 in total 16 districts — East, West, South, Central, Korangi, Keamari and Malir of Karachi division and Hyderabad, Dadu, Jamshoro, Matiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Badin, Sujawal and Thatta of Hyderabad division — in the second phase of the LG polls. 
Recently, Sindh Election Commissioner Ejaz Anwar Chauhan had said that he was in touch with district administrations concerned and got reports that rainwater was still accumulated in Hyderabad, Matiari, Dadu, Badin, Thatta and Sujawal districts as well as area like Malir, Lyari, Kharadar, Mithadar of Karachi.
On Monday, almost all nine deputy commissioners of Hyderabad division and one DC of Karachi’s Malir district approached the ECP to seek postponement of the Aug 28 local government elections.

As many as 10 DCs approach ECP for postponement of Aug 28 polls in view of rain destruction 

Jamshoro DC Fariduddin Mustafa confirmed having approached the Election Commission in writing to seek postponement of polls for 45 days. 
In his letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, he stated that the ECP had first postponed the LG polls scheduled for July 24 on account of heavy rainfall forecast.
The letter said that at present 375 out of 452 polling stations — 70 per cent of the total polling stations — were inaccessible presently in Jamshoro district and they were submerged by water. 
The letter said that a report was sought from returning officers who had also expressed their inability to conduct the local government elections in view of heavy rainfall and floods in the district. 
He requested the ECP to postpone the polls for 45 days as conduct of polls and supply of election material was not possible.
Hyderabad DC Fuad Soomro also confirmed having written a letter to the ECP for postponement of the LG polls “till situation improved”. 
He stated in the letter said that Hyderabad district was affected due to heavy rainfall that caused a loss of human lives, livestock, crops, houses, public and private infrastructure including schools.
He said the Sindh Relief Commissioner had on Aug 21 declared Hyderabad district as a calamity-hit area. He stated that the LG polls on Aug 28 were not possible due to destruction and inaccessibility of buildings of schools, health facilities and other places. 
He also referred to the forecast of another spell of rains in Hyderabad by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) and the meteorological department.
The Tando Mohammad Khan DC also wrote a letter to the ECP seeking postponement of the LG elections for 45 days.
However, the Badin DC requested the ECP to postpone the LG polls for 60 days in view of current situation arising out of rains. He stated that all districts of Hyderabad division had been declared calamity affected. He said all ROs had reported that they were unable to conduct the LG polls in view of rains.
Sujawal DC Shaharyar Memon stated that polling was to take place on 233 polling stations of which 66 were in coastal talukas of Jati and Shah Bunder districts which were adversely affected by rainfall, leaving infrastructure as dangerous and roads inaccessible. He said in view of this factual position necessary action may be taken by PEC.
In Karachi, the Malir deputy commissioner wrote to the ECP that the ongoing monsoon spell had played havoc on district Malir and there were a number of populated areas which “are still inaccessible and have deprived of basic amenities” due to heavy downpour.
The letter stated that the district administration was taking all-out efforts to hold LG polls, “it seems a bit unpredictable to commit or guarantee at the current stage as to whether the polling would be fesible or not in certain areas of Gadap bordering with Balochistan where road network is completely damaged”.

4,Opposition leader in Sindh Haleem Adil Sheikh granted bail in land grabbing case,His lawyer says jail authorities refused to release PTI leader despite court order.,"KARACHI: The Special Court Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) on Monday granted bail to interned Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf in a land-grab case.
The Anti-Encroachment Force (AEF) had arrested Mr Sheikh after the judge had revoked his interim pre-arrest bail for ‘failing’ to appear before the court on Aug 17.
The AEF Zone-I had booked Mr Sheikh in a case pertaining to alleged illegal occupation of 40 acres of state land in Manghopir near Northern Bypass.
On Monday, Judge Akhlaque Hussain Larik granted the post-arrest bail to Mr Sheikh against a surety bond in sum of Rs100,000.

His lawyer says jail authorities refused to release PTI leader despite court order

The judge also fixed Sept 8 for framing charges against the opposition leader and others nominated in the present case.
Defence counsel Zaheer Mehsud argued that the neither his client had been arrested  from the crime scene nor was any evidence available with the prosecution  to establish his role in the commissioning of the alleged offence.
He  further argued that the applicant had no role in illegal occupation of  the land in question, as falsely alleged by the prosecution with mala  fide intention to achieve their ulterior motives.
The counsel  claimed that Mr Sheikh had been subjected to political victimisation at  the hands of the ruling party in the province.
He argued that the  Sections under which the FIR had been lodged did not fall under the  prohibitory clause, therefore, bail might be granted to the applicant,  who was behind bars for the last five days.
In the meanwhile, the court directed the superintendent of the  Karachi central prison to release Mr Sheikh forthwith if his custody was  not required in any other case.
Earlier, prison officials failed to produce the suspect in court during hearing of his bail application.
Jailer refuses to release Haleem
Later in the evening, Advocate Mahsud told Dawn that the prison authorities refused to release the opposition leader, claiming his custody was required in other cases as well.
He said that they had approached the Karachi central prison with the release order of Mr Sheikh issued by the court, but Jail Superintendent Hassan Sehto refused to release his client, saying his custody was required in some other ‘undisclosed’ cases.
The lawyer said a habeas corpus application had been filed with the relevant court seeking recovery of the PTI leader from alleged “illegal confinement” at the jail.
He saidthat  District and Sessions Judge (East) Naeem Memon had issued a notice for  Tuesday (today) to the jail superintendent with direction to submit a  report regarding alleged unlawful confinement of Mr Sheikh.
On the last date, the court had dismissed the application of Mr Sheikh seeking confirmation of the interim pre-arrest bail granted him to earlier, as he had failed to appear before the investigating officer. After the bail dismissal, he was arrested and sent to prison on judicial remand.
A case was registered under Sections 8(i) of the Special Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010 at the Anti-Encroachment Force Zone-I, Karachi, on behalf of the state.

5,Brilliant Bach and magnificent Maliqi,Young pianist from Kosovo enthrals audience at German Consulate,"KARACHI: What does the phrase ‘music has no language barriers’ mean? It has multiple meanings in the cultural context, the foremost of which is that the primary purpose of any form of art is to communicate to an audience feelings or emotions formed in a certain temporal setting. But, they say, western classical music is acquired taste. 
Well, the spellbinding performance that the pianist, Fatjona Maliqi, from Kosovo gave at the German Consulate on Sunday evening could have converted someone with no ear for music into a music aficionado in no time. She was super impressive. 
Two things need to be mentioned here. One, Maliqi is young; she is in her twenties; two, she was scheduled to play the Goldberg Variations (named after the likely first performer of the work) by none other than the great German composer Johann Sebastian Bach written in the former half of the 18th century. 
A young woman asked to play no fewer than 30 extremely difficult and astounding variations created by the late master for the harpsichord! But Maliqi made it sound (and look) so easy on the eye with a recital that exuded a delightful combination of heart and mind. This suggests while she played the piano with a lot of heart as she was utterly immersed in her performance, her understanding of classical compositions indicates that she is a sagacious student of the art form. One can’t wait to see her progress as an artist.
Bach wrote the 30 short pieces, a printed introduction to the concert handed out to the select group of invitees read, “To soothe the sleepless nights of one Count Keyserlingk”. 
Maliqi conveyed the mood of the composition to the audience from the get go, that is, from the first piece which began steadily with gentle pressing of the keys. As things moved along, the pianist, with tremendous control and flair, shifted her art into storytelling mode, displaying exemplary dexterity. By the time she played the 10th variation (fughetta), not even half way through her act, everyone was riveted on her.
As expected, by the time Maliqi finished the gig, she received a well-deserved round of applause. That wasn’t it. She, after thanking her hosts, as a special treat for her Pakistani friends, played Pakistan’s national anthem on the piano. It was heart-warming.

6,Sindh govt plans steps to improve life of senior citizens,KARACHI: The government is in the process of amending the Sindh Senior Citizens Welfare Act 2014. It plans to set up...,"KARACHI: The government is in the process of amending the Sindh Senior Citizens Welfare Act 2014. It plans to set up old homes in every district of the province and issue special cards to the elderly for providing them certain facilities.  
This was stated by Abdul Waheed Sheikh, secretary of the provincial social welfare department, at an event organised at the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) in connection with the World Senior Citizen Day.  
The theme of the event -- DUHS Grand Parents Day -- was “Active ageing, a privilege denied to many”. 
Speaking at the programme, Mr Sheikh said the department had signed an agreement with the National Database Registration Authority (Nadra) to issue special cards to senior citizens, which would help them avail certain facilities.  
“Besides, we have also proposed certain amendments to the Sindh Senior Citizens Welfare Act 2014, which was passed in 2016. The amendments meant to remove any hindrance that may exist in law’s implementation,” he told the audience.  
The government was also engaged in consultation with experts of different fields to improve life of the elderly in society, he added.  
Prof Nusrat Shah, acting vice chancellor at the DUHS, shared how family traditions had changed over the decades. The concept of active ageing was getting stronger as now couples wanted to live an independent life, he added. “The centuries’ old tradition of a joint family system has changed. Often the youth go abroad for greener pastures and stay there. These factors are encouraging the elderly to optimise opportunities for health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of their life,” she said.  
Prof Jahan Ara, Dr Faisal Yameen and Dr Mona Shah also spoke.  
The Dow university, she pointed out, had introduced an online e-coordinator course for the general public that could guide them about how they could look after the elderly better.   
“The average age in the world has increased to 68 years. Hence, our life expectancy is also increasing, which means that greater emphasis is needed on the improvement of quality of life.”  
Prof Saba Sohail, principal of the Dow Medical College, said the age should not be determined by numbers, but rather by physical health and condition.   
“The concept of ageing varies in different societies. In our country, people in their mid 60s are considered old while in Africa people in their 50s are considered old. What is important, however, is mental and physical health which should be looked after well irrespective of the age factor.”  
Dr Anum Arshad heading the family health section at the DUHS spoke about geriatric issues and stressed upon healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, making smart food choices, sleeping well, quitting smoking, pursuing hobbies and managing stress by getting involved in social activities.   
Dr Washdev, assistant professor of psychiatry at the DUHS, highlighted the issue of depression in older adults and said it was often a result of life circumstances including death of a loved one, chronic illness, or retirement.   
“It can be prevented by keeping physically, mentally and socially active,” he suggested.  
Senior nutritionist Badar Hina talked about the importance of balanced diet, and consumption of high fibre food, less sugar and less salt.

The thoughts were shared in an interactive meeting organised by the Renewables First in collaboration with Pakistan Renewable Energy Coalition, a common platform of the key stakeholders in the renewable energy sector for the developers of the area to address their concerns. 
Sharing his viewpoints, Dr Irfan Mirza of the Renewable Resources emphasised the need to create a dedicated space for dialogue and engagement with the government. 
The energy sector stakeholders and experts, he said, remained uncertain about the government policy which damaged the scope of long-term planning.
“A common platform for renewable energy developers to address their concerns has been missing for a long time,” said Mustafa Amjad of the Renewables First. “The current forum aimed to fill this need and facilitate developers in establishing themselves as legitimate stakeholders in the energy sector. The forum also allowed them to raise mutual concerns, forge new partnerships and explore opportunities to expand their networks.”
The participants discussed various issues faced by the developers due to which they had to visit a myriad of different departments and ministries in order to get approvals, and the need for local manufacturing incentives for RE industry in order to strengthen local supply.
Some developers also informed the organisers of their need for education and training on government policies such as wheeling and Competitive Training Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM), to reduce common confusions.
The developers also expressed disappointment at the curtailment practices carried out by the government, and said only a portion of the loss incurred repaid by the agreement as penalties.
The meeting was of the view that reliable market signals were also crucial in protecting investor confidence, without which there was an increasing unwillingness to invest in the sector on part of both domestic and international stakeholders.

‘Robber held’ 
A suspected robber, who shot dead a trader over resistance in Clifton, was arrested on Monday, said SSP-South (investigation) Dr Mohammed Imran Khan.

Cotton trader Veerbhan, 35, had drawn cash from a private bank in Clifton near Schon Circle in January. He was travelling in a car when three robbers riding two motorbikes intercepted and snatched over Rs7 million from him. As the trader put up resistance, the robbers opened fire on him and fled. He suffered a single bullet wound in the abdomen, which proved fatal. 
The victim had come to Karachi from Dharaki to finalise a deal regarding an apartment and drew the cash for the same.

A visit to the plaza on Monday morning revealed that stairs of first and second floors were littered with glass strewn as a result of yesterday’s stoning from outside by unruly mob. Electricity supply to the plaza remained disconnected as the mob had cut wires at the plaza’s gate. 
The plaza has 30 residential flats — five on each floor — and stands in the midst of Saddar Bazaar.
“Everyone has left. Only we are staying on; and we have also temporarily shifted to some other accommodation,” said one Hindu resident. Occupants of the flats are either tenants or owners. Some of them are tenants of Muslim owners, he added. Out of 30 families, around 18-20 are Hindu living in their flats.
Teargas shelling by police continued on Risala Road till Sunday-Monday midnight. The area remained under darkness. An uneasy calm prevailed in the city Monday. Mobile markets located in different plazas of the area remained closed. Shops in the bazaars of Saddar, Tilak Incline, Lajpat Road, Cantonment and district council shopping centres and other commercial areas in Latifabad remained closed. 
Some youths tried to move towards the plaza but Rangers personnel scared them away.
Heavy contingent of police has been deployed in the Saddar area. Police force from adjoining smaller districts was called to the city to restore law and order by assisting the Hyderabad police. An armoured personnel carrier (APC) was deployed outside the affected plaza. The law enforcers have blocked streets, leading to the plaza, with barbed wires.

The FIR mentioned between 150 and 200 as unknown suspects. The FIR said that the arrested suspects were involved in ransacking and aerial firing on roads while carrying lathis, iron rods and weapons. They had damaged private and public properties and created obstruction in the discharge of official duties of police, the complainant said, adding that he and his colleagues also fired shots into the air to disperse the crowd.
The blasphemy FIR (70/22) was lodged by Bilal Abbasi, a resident of Dadan Shah Mohallah.

12,Bilawal orders steps to ensure ‘ease of movement’,Says rehabilitation across Sindh be undertaken after dewatering areas,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has directed the provincial government to clear roads, streets and houses of stagnating rainwater at the earliest at least to enable people to move about their lives with comparative ease and then launch a rehabilitation drive for the repair of houses, drainage and roads. 
He said during a visit to a relief camp set up in the Government Technical College along with Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and at a meeting he chaired at deputy commissioner’s office later on Monday that the district administration should procure machinery and dispose of the rainwater immediately. 
He directed the administration to improve hygiene at relief camps, provide quality food and clean water, electricity and mosquito nets to the rain-affectees, otherwise “we may have to fight against viral diseases later”. 
The chairman was informed that 26 people died and 367 were injured in rain-related incidents in the district and the administration had set up 290 relief camps where 28,500 people had been lodged. 

Says rehabilitation across Sindh be undertaken after dewatering areas 

Almost 90 per cent standing crop of rice had been washed away and thousands of houses had been damaged in urban and rural areas for which a survey was being conducted, said the meeting.  
The chief minister said that district administration would immediately start draining out stagnant rainwater. “We are planning to construct a storm-water drain in the city,” he said. 
Earlier, Bilawal drove directly to Larkana along with the chief minister after landing at the airport in Sukkur. He met rain-affectees and assured them that they would be looked after properly.

CM reviews water flows at Sukkur barrage 
The chief minister accompanied by Federal Minister Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah and provincial ministers Nasir Hussain Shah, Owais Qadir Shah and Ikramullah Dharejo visited Sukkur barrage on Monday to review water flows. 
He told media persons after being briefed by irrigation officials that they expected over 600,000 cusecs flows, which was considered high-flood, to pass under Guddu barrage. The flows would reach Sukkur barrage without diminishing in volume because all canals were closed at the moment due to heavy rains, said the CM, adding, the high-flood was moving towards Kotri barrage. 
He said that officials had told him all vulnerable points along the Indus River dykes from Guddu to Sukkur and Kotri had been identified and required machinery had been made available to avert any unwanted incident. 
He said that he had directed the irrigation officials to increase number of check-posts along the dykes at a distance of less than a mile and reinforce manpower. 
He directed the chief secretary to seek help from international agencies such as UNO, World Food Program, Unicef and European Union because this crisis was no lesser than the crisis of 2010, 11, 12, and 20. In fact, this crisis was graver than the previous ones, he said, adding that current rain was 500 per cent more than the rain recorded in past in Sindh, he claimed. 
He informed media persons that prime minister was likely to visit Sukkur division soon. 
Murad visits Khairpur
