0,SBP leaves policy rate unchanged at 15pc ‘to fight inflation’,"Pakistan will get $2bn from Qatar, $1bn from Saudi Arabia and $1bn investments from UAE, says SBP acting governor.","• Says current account deficit to fall further on moderate demand  • Pakistan secures $4bn from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and UAE 
KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday left its policy rate unchanged at 15 per cent for the next two months to cool down the economy and control inflation.
“To cool the overheating economy and contain the current account deficit (CAD), the policy rate has been raised by a cumulative 800 basis points since last September, some temporary administrative steps have recently been taken to curtail imports, and strong fiscal consolidation is planned for FY23,” said the central bank in its Monetary Policy Statement.
With recent inflation developments in line with expectations, domestic demand beginning to moderate and the external position showing some improvement, the SBP felt that it was prudent to pause rate hikes at this stage, said the SBP.
Since the last meeting, the SBP noted headline inflation rose further to 24.9pc in July, with core inflation also ticking up, it said.
The SBP said that the withdrawal of the subsidy package on energy will continue to manifest in inflation out-turns throughout the rest of the fiscal year—as well as momentum in the prices of essential food items and exchange rate weakness last month.
The central bank believes the expected inflow of $1.2bn from IMF will work as a catalyst for financing from multilateral and bilateral lenders.
The SBP confirmed that Pakistan has successfully secured an additional $4bn from friendly countries over and above its external financing needs in FY23.
On balance, the SBP noted that some greater slowdown in global growth would not be as harmful to Pakistan as for most other emerging economies, given the relatively small share of exports and foreign private inflows in the economy.
As a result, both inflation and the CAD should fall as global commodity prices ease, while growth would not be as badly affected, said the SBP.
The headline inflation is projected to peak in the first quarter before declining gradually through the rest of the fiscal year. Thereafter, it is expected to decline sharply and fall to the 5-7pc target range by the end of FY24, supported by the lagged effects of tight monetary and fiscal policies, the normalisation of global commodity prices, and beneficial base effects.
“As expected, economic activity has moderated since the last MPC. Most demand indicators have softened—sales of cement, POL, fertilisers and automobiles fell month-on-month in July—and year-on-year growth in LSM almost halved in June,” said the SBP.
Recent flooding caused by unusually heavy and prolonged monsoon rains creates downside risks for agricultural production, especially cotton and seasonal crops, and could weigh on growth this year.
“The SBP continues to expect growth to moderate to 3-4pc in FY23, on account of the tightening of fiscal and monetary policies,” it added.
The trade deficit halved to $2.7bn in July, imports fell sharply by 36.6pc (month-on-month) and 10.4pc (year-on-year) while exports also declined by 22.7pc month-on-month, it added.
Through administrative measures imports declined and the rupee gained due to diminished uncertainty about the IMF programme but the administrative measures are not sustainable and will need to be eased in the coming months, said the SBP.
It will be critical that the envisaged fiscal consolidation in FY23 is delivered and that strong measures are taken to curtail energy imports. Such measures include early closure of markets, reduced electricity use by residential and commercial customers, and greater encouragement of work from home and car pooling, said the SBP.
With the expected completion of the upcoming IMF review and the additional assistance secured from friendly countries, foreign exchange reserves are projected to rise to around $16bn during FY23, said the SBP, adding that to ensure this and to support the rupee, it will be important to contain the CAD to around 3pc of GDP by moderating domestic demand and energy imports.
The SBP said that for the first time in seven years, the FY23 budget targets a primary surplus, on the back of significantly higher tax revenue. It envisages a strong fiscal consolidation of around 3pc of GDP, which is appropriate to cool the economy and ensure a reduction in inflation and the CAD throughout the year.
Exporters and manufacturers 
The manufacturers and exporters were extremely worried about high-interest rates that made the cost of doing business much higher making them uncompetitive on the global market.
“While we are not getting fresh orders from Europe and USA, the increasing cost of our products has made it more difficult to remain within the market,” said Amir Aziz, an exporter of readymade garments to Europe and the USA. “If we lose the market, it will be highly difficult to re-capture the market space currently we have,” he added.
Inflows from friendly countries
While meeting with brokerage analysts on Monday, SBP Acting Governor Murtaza Syed said Pakistan has arranged $4bn in financing from friendly countries. 
“Pakistan will get $2bn from Qatar, $1bn from Saudi Arabia under the umbrella of deferred oil facility and $1bn investments from the UAE in various sectors,” he said.
Pakistan’s gross financing needs would be around $30bn for FY23 including the amount required for CAD and debt repayments.
He said the available financing against this is estimated at $37bn for FY23. The amount increased after Pakistan secured $4bn of financing from friendly countries.

1,Auto financing falls in July,"Overall car, truck, and SUV sales fell to a 23-month low of 11,883 units in July.","KARACHI: The meteoric rise in vehicle prices, soaring interest rate and the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) strict rules have resulted in a slight drop of two per cent month-on-month (MoM) in auto financing to Rs361 billion in July.
However, year-on-year (YoY) financing increased by 15pc due to the auto sector’s recovery following the Covid-19 period, according to market analysts.
The SBP’s restrictions on auto financing for amounts greater than three million rupees, an increase in debt burden ratio (debt payment as a percentage of disposable income), a massive increase in car prices, and high-interest rates have resulted in a monthly drop in auto financing, said Samiullah Tariq, the Head of Research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company.
Meanwhile, Tahir Abbas, the Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited (AHL), said auto financing in the coming mon­ths would remain under pressure given availability issues of vehicles due to long delays in delivery, the SBP’s strict measures to confine auto financing, high car prices, and interest rates.
According to Top Line Securities, Honda Atlas Cars Limited (HACL) informed an analyst briefing earlier this month that auto financing contributes 40pc of total HACL sales and would drop to 30pc under the current scenario. Honda management predicted a 25-35pc drop in sales in FY23 as a result of higher prices and high-interest rates.
Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL) reported to analysts in May 2022 that auto financing accounts for 35pc of total sales. However, PSMCL anticipated a 5-10pc drop in sales during FY23 as a result of rising prices, interest rates, and shorter loan terms.
In May 2022, Indus Motor Company (IMC) informed analysts that auto financing accounted for approximately 26pc of total IMC sales. The company anticipates a 25–35pc drop in volumetric sales in FY23. IMC on Monday resumed booking of vehicles after suspending it on May 18, 2022, due to parts shortages and uncertain exchange rate parity.
Overall car, truck, and SUV sales fell to a 23-month low of 11,883 units in July 2022, representing a 58pc and 52pc decrease MoM and YoY, respectively.

2,KP growers seek removal of tax on tobacco,Warn of protest outside Federal Board of Revenue in capital and block motorways if their demand is not met.,"ISLAMABAD: Farmers from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday urged the federal government to withdraw the Rs380 per kg advance tax on tobacco.
At a press conference held at the National Press Club in Islamabad, the tobacco farmers’ representatives said that they would stage a protest in front of the Federal Board of Revenue in the capital and block motorways if their demand was not met.
Speaking to the media, Mehnatkash Labour Federation President Ibrar Ullah said that the price of tobacco per kg in the open market is Rs256 per kg while the advance tax on it is Rs380 per kg.
“The advance tax on tobacco leaf is hurting the sale of the crop in the market. This would render over 15,000 labourers and 20,000 families of farmers jobless,” he added.
Kissan Board President Rizwan Ullah also rejected the imposition of the advance tax on the crop, saying the government is destroying the ripe crop of the farmers through such tactics instead of providing them relief.
“All tobacco farmers from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province would stage a sit-in in Islamabad if the advance tax on the crop was not withdrawn,” he added.
Liaqat Yousafzai of Kashtkar Coordin­ation Council Khyber Pakhtunkhwa termed the imposition of the advance tax on the tobacco crop “public enmity”. He said that rates of tobacco use were increasing the world over, while they were decreasing in Pakistan. The farmers in Swabi, Mardan, Charsadda, Boner, and Mansehra grow the tobacco crop, and they have urged the government to facilitate them by withdrawing the advance tax on it.

3,‘Opec+ can confront market challenges’,"Work on a new agreement between Opec+ partners beyond 2022 will start soon, he says.","RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister said Opec+ has the means and flexibility to deal with challenges, including by cutting oil output, state news agency SPA reported on Monday, citing comments Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman made to Bloomberg.
The minister also said that paper and physical markets had become increasingly disconnected, and that a new deal between OPEC+ partners beyond 2022 would be agreed.
“Soon we will start working on a new agreement beyond 2022,” he said.
Brent crude prices pared losses sharply on the news and were trading down 55 cents at $96.17 by 1637 GMT, having earlier slipped to as low as $92.36.
The Opec+ agreed to increase output by 648,000 bpd in each of July and August. The group agreed earlier this month to raise production quotas by another 100,000 bpd in September as it faced pressure from major consumers including the United States, which are keen to cool prices.
Only Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are believed to have spare capacity and the ability to increase production in a meaningful way. But Prince Abdulaziz pointed to thin liquidity and extreme volatility taking focus away from the issue of spare capacity.

“These projects, which are scheduled to be completed from 2022 to 2029 in a phased manner, will add 11.7 million acre feet (MAF) of gross water storage and 11,300 megawatt (MW) of low-cost, clean and green hydroelectricity to the national grid,” Wapda Chairman, retired Lt Gen Sajjad Ghani, said after receiving detailed briefings on various projects.
“On-time completion is a huge challenge, but there lies an opportunity in these challenges as well. We can take the opportunity to lift Wapda’s stature at national as well as international level,” said Mr Ghani.
“My foremost priority is to complete these under-construction projects as per their schedules, in addition to initiating new projects to cope with the increasing requirements of water and electricity in the country,” he asserted.

Arif Habib Ltd said investors opted to stay on the sidelines as they awaited the monetary policy announcement by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Trading in the main-board stocks rema­ined dry whereas hefty volumes were observed in third-tier stocks.
In line with market expectations, the monetary policy committee of the SBP deci­ded to keep the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 15 per cent. The SBP said the country has secured additional financing of $4 billion from friendly nations over and above the external financing needs in 2022-23 — a fact that’s likely to ease the country’s balance-of-payment crisis.
JS Global said investors preferred to book profits amid a lack of positive triggers and rising political temperature.

The greenback closed the session at Rs216.66 against Rs214.65 the previous session, reported the central bank. The dollar’s appreciation was not out of expectation since the SBP foreign exchange reserves have constantly been declining with no inflows so far noted.
However, the central bank on Monday said $4bn has been arranged for meeting Pakistan’s external financing needs before getting approval from the IMF board for a $1.2bn tranche. Good news for the market but the sentiments were still in favour of the US dollar.

7,Firm to buy stake in fintech through SAFE note,SAFE notes represent a “simple agreement for future equity” — a capital-raising method that’s getting increasingly popular.,"KARACHI: Cordoba Logistics and Ventures Ltd (CLVL) said on Monday it’s going to invest Rs31 million in an up-and-coming fintech Neem Exponential by purchasing a “SAFE note” for future equity.
SAFE notes represent a “simple agreement for future equity” — a capital-raising method that’s getting increasingly popular especially in the startup sphere dominated by foreign investors.
Speaking to Dawn, CLVL CEO Misbah Khalil Khan said the purchase of a SAFE note will allow his company to take an equity stake in a fast-growing startup at an early stage when its valuation is on the lower side.
SAFE notes are popular among startups looking for ways to raise seed capital. They ultimately get converted into stocks at a discounted price on a future date. Many SAFE notes carry valuation caps, meaning the investor already knows the highest possible conversion rate.
“With every new round of funding, the equity share of existing investors in a startup goes down. But we’ll get a better share price than any future investors because the SAFE note carries a valuation cap,” said Mr Khan.
The investing entity is listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Formerly known as Mian Textile Industries Ltd, the company changed its name and business model last year. It mainly operates as an aggregator of commercial vehicles to major players, like Daewoo Express, in the transport and logistics sectors.
Separately, CLVL holds equity investments in a portfolio of ventures that includes online platform for shippers and carriers Trukkr, learning portal Investors Lounge, children’s clothing company Cotton Candy and, most recently, language-teaching institute Berlitz Pakistan.
As for Neem Exponential, Mr Khan claimed it’s one of the country’s leading embedded finance companies — technology firms that integrate financial services traditionally offered by banks into the product portfolio of non-financial entities.
“The company provides back-end services and technology support to startups offering digital wallets and collects a service fee. It’s run by an experienced team of entrepreneurs with a proven track record,” he said.
Separately, CLVL informed investors in a regulatory filing on Monday about the subscription status of its rights issue consisting of 50 million shares worth Rs10 each. Companies offer rights issue to raise fresh capital by inviting their existing shareholders to purchase additional new shares at less than the market price on a future date.
