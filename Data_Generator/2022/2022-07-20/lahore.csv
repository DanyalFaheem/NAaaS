1,Proposed changes to service rules rile ‘frontline’ doctors,Committee favours medics having ad hoc experience in hard areas,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has proposed amendments to the services rules to count the experience for promotion of only those medical teachers / doctors who served at ‘underprivileged’ districts of the province during ad hoc appointments.  
The move has riled the doctors of the mainstream teaching institutes which played a key role in fighting Covid and dengue epidemics. Despite working on the frontline, they say, they will be denied promotions which is a grave injustice.  
Headed by the Punjab chief secretary, the committee comprises secretaries of health, services, regulations, law and other related departments. At a meeting held recently, the committee proposed amendments to the ‘Punjab Health Department (Medical & Dental Teaching Posts) Service Rules 1979’ to give benefit to only those doctors who served in the institutes of underprivileged districts. It ignored more than 150 other medics who served during hard times of Covid epidemic at the major teaching institutes of Lahore, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad and Multan, which were declared highly sensitive for sharing a huge burden of the disease.  
In 2020, the SH&MED had moved a summary to the Punjab chief minister, seeking one-time extension in ad hoc appointments of these medics. In 2021, they were again granted extension for a brief period.  

Committee favours medics having ad hoc experience in hard areas  

An official said a number of teaching cadre regular medics serving in the public sector medical institutes were facing discrimination in fundamental right to promotion. He said the ad hoc appointments of these senior medical teachers were made as assistant and associate professors on an emergency basis. He said the “selective justice” landed these medics in trouble when they were declared ineligible to get promotions according to the proposed amendments to the service rules 1979.  
“Many of them are exploring the option to quit the government job or challenge the committee’s decision in a court of law for not considering the amendments across the board,” the official said.  
The official said the health secretary defended these medics by preparing a strong case and presenting it at the committee meeting. He presented many references including policies as evidence which were exercised in the past to allow the government to consider the ad hoc period as experience for promotion cases.  
“As already laid down, the ad hoc appointment period will count as experience for purpose of fulfilling the requirements of the Service Rules. The ad hoc period in a junior post of a person subsequently selected by the Commission should be taken into consideration when determining his eligibility for a senior post or the same post,” reads an official letter of the Services & General Administration Department issued on Feb 21, 1970.
The committee was further briefed that the ad hoc experience was always considered in the promotion process in the past and was in line with ESTA Codes and there were numerous examples of the people who benefitted. However, the official said, a secretary of a government department strongly opposed the scheme to make amendments for “all medical teachers”, suggesting to the CS to restrict these (amendments) to the doctors serving in hard areas of Punjab.  
A few other members also endorsed his viewpoint and the committee made a controversial decision to benefit few medics only, he said. He said the Punjab government had offered them appointment on ad hoc seats through advertisements in 2019 when the health department’s requisitions sent to the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC) for promotions got delayed.  
After the due process, the SH&MED issued no objection certificates (NOCs) to the medics who had applied for ad hoc appointments. However, the Punjab health department later refused to take more services of these medics on an ad hoc basis, directing them to go back to their original seats, the official said.  
As they rejoined their original posts, the department told them that the experience they had obtained would not be considered for their promotions against original seats.  
The affected medics have appealed to the prime minister and the Punjab chief minister to take notice of the discrimination and intervene to grant them one-time more exemption besides considering their cases for the promotion.

2,Health secretary told to produce five VCs’ recruitment record,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has directed the secretary (specialised healthcare) to produce record relating to...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has directed the secretary (specialised healthcare) to produce record relating to recruitment against posts of vice chancellors in five public sector medical universities in Punjab.
Justice Shujaat Ali Khan issued the order on a writ petition filed by plastic surgeon Dr. Farid Ahmad Khan of Services Hospital, Lahore.
On behalf of the petitioner, Advocate Hafiz Tariq Nasim argued before the court that allocation of 50 marks for interview goes against the spirit of Recruitment Policy 2022.
The counsel alleged mala fide on the part played by respondents in the recruitment process and particularly pointed out to the court that the petitioner had professional rivalry with one of the members of the search committee namely Dr. Moazzam Nazir Tarar, retired professor of plastic surgery.
He alleged that the member caused damage to the petitioner while sitting in the search committee to select five vice chancellors.
Advocate Nasim submitted that the alleged recruitment process of 50 marks interview had an axe to grind against the interest of the aggrieved petitioner as it was against Recruitment Policy of 2022.
He requested the court to summon requisite record pertaining to the search committee meeting held on July 1, 2022.
The counsel told the court that the petitioner was a renowned plastic surgeon of the country and had been victimised and targeted in the interview and had a legitimate expectancy to be treated in accordance with law and the Constitution.
After hearing counsel for the petitioner, Justice Khan directed the secretary (specialised healthcare) for production of the recruitment record through a special representative not below the rank of BS-17 on July 25.
The judge also issued notices to the secretary and other respondents.
The universities where the appointment of the VCs has been challenged in the petition are King Edward Medical University, University of Health Sciences, Fatima Jinnah Medical University, Allama Iqbal Medical University and Sahiwal Medical University.
MEESHA CASE: A sessions court has allowed an opportunity to singer Meesha Shafi to complete her remaining cross-examination on Sept 6 in a defamation suit against her by actor-cum-singer Ali Zafar with a warning of punitive action in case of further failure.  
Advocate Saqib Jillani filed an application on behalf of Shafi seeking an adjournment in the suit, saying his client was in Canada and would return in September for her remaining cross-examination. He said if the hearing was fixed for any date of the first week of September, the defendant would definitely appear before the court for her remaining cross-examination.
The counsel said he would have no objection to punitive action against the defendant if she did not appear before the court on the next hearing. He said a petition of the singer was also pending with the Supreme Court for recording of her cross-examination through a video link.  
Zafar’s counsel Umar Gill opposed the adjournment request by the defendant’s counsel, contending that the suit had been pending since 2018 and examination-in-chief of the defendant was recorded in 2019. He said despite passage of about three years, Shafi’s cross-examination had not been completed and that too due to her non-cooperation.  
In the written order issued about the July 14 hearing, Additional District and Sessions Judge Khan Mahmood observed that it divulged from record that the examination-in-chief (statement) of the defendant was recorded on Dec 9, 2019 and so far her cross-examination had not been completed. However, the judge allowed the request of Shafi’s counsel in the interest of justice and adjourned the hearing till Sept 6 with a warning that punitive action would be taken against her and her statement would be discarded in case of her failure to appear.

14,"Govt pressurising MPAs ahead of voting for Punjab CM, says opposition","Raja Basharat submits resolution in Punjab Assembly session to bar ""agencies"" from intervention in the election.","LAHORE: The opposition in Punjab Assembly alleges that its MPAs are being threatened and pressurised by the government through intelligence agencies and police to ‘manipulate’ the voting for the chief minister. 
In a resolution tabled by PTI leader Raja Basharat in the ongoing controversial session of the assembly, chaired by Speaker Parvez Elahi on Tuesday, it was alleged that ‘the terrorism’ by both the federal and provincial governments is at its peak as complaints are being received from members of this house that intelligence agencies are tracing locations and they are receiving phone calls from the powers that matter. The threats are being hurled and pressure is being built through police, it said. 
“The July 22 election is being held on the Supreme Court order. There are clear directions from the Supreme Court that any attempt to sabotage the election process will be considered as contempt of court. 
“Therefore, it is requested that this resolution is adopted and the relevant agencies are warned to refrain from illegal intervention,” said the resolution read out by Raja Basharat in the session being boycotted by the government MPAs from its day one. 

Basharat submits resolution in PA session to bar ‘agencies’ from intervention  

The opposition has also moved the LHC against the government’s alleged highhandedness. Besides, it is also moving its lawmakers to a hotel in an apparent bid to avert any attempt of influencing their loyalties either through incentives or threats. 
In the first electoral contest for the office of the chief minister held on April 16, the then opposition PML-N had also housed its own lawmakers and of the allied parties in a hotel for about a week. It also decided to again assemble the MPAs supporting its candidate, Hamza Shehbaz, in a hotel and then jointly reach the assembly on July 22 to take part in the election for the CM. 
Meanwhile, taking advantage of the absence of the Treasury MPAs, the opposition passed the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab Secretariat Services (Repeal and Revival) Bill 2022, and the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab Privileges (Repeal and Revival) Bill 2022. As copies of the bills, unlike the tradition, were not distributed among the press gallery members, it could not be ascertained what changes had been made to the laws. However, it is believed to be aimed at freeing the assembly secretariat from the control of the Punjab law department secretary and restoring powers of the speaker for penalising any officer for breaching privilege of the house or any member. 
The assembly secretariat had been put under the law secretary and powers of the speaker were reduced through two earlier laws passed at a session summoned on the orders of the governor at a building close to the assembly chambers last month. The session was boycotted by the opposition. 
The house on Tuesday also passed the Lahore City University Bill 2021 moved by a private member, Saadia Suhail Rana. Copies of the resolution and of the university bills were also not distributed among the press gallery members. Instead, only some hand-written pages of the resolution and one carrying titles of the bills were given to the media and that too as WhatsApp images.
