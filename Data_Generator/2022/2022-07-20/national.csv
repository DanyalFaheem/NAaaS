• Survivor says plank fell out of the hull
DADU/RAHIM YAR KHAN: At least 26 people were laid to rest in their na­­tive village Hussain Ba­­khsh Solangi near Machke in Sin­dh and 27 remained missing despite rescue operations a day after a tragic boat accident in the Indus River near Rahim Yar Khan claimed the lives of over two dozen people.
The funeral prayers were attended by clan chief Sardar Abbas Khan Solangi who con­­firmed to Dawn that pray­ers for at least 26 people, inc­luding two children and a wo­man whose bodies were fi­­shed out later on, were offe­r­­ed at their ancestral graveyard.
Mr Solangi demanded compensation from Sindh and Punjab (where the incident took place) governments as he blamed them for failure to construct bridges in the area forcing people to use worn-out wooden boats to cross the river.
Dozens remained missing despite the passage of over a day after the capsizing incident, and their relatives waited on the banks of the Indus with hopes for the success of the rescue operation launched to retrieve the remaining bodies.
However, rescuers did not have much luck on Tuesday. A contingent of 18 Pakistan Army divers from Mangla also arrived in Rahim Yar Khan to take part in the rescue operation, according to the Rahim Yar Khan deputy commissioner.
The accident occurred on Monday when a wedding party was returning to Machke from Khrore village in two boats. One of the boats was overloaded and capsized after one of the planks in its hull fell apart, a cousin of the groom told Dawn. Muhammad Hussain said mostly women and children of his family drowned as only the men were rescued in the initial efforts. Mr Hussain said eight members of a single-family drowned in the accident along with their relatives — all belonged to the Solangi clan.
Ghulam Hussain, an uncle of the groom, said all his relatives were on board the boat for the wedding function and they normally used boats for crossing the Indus. He said it was a sudden accident that’s why the men in the boat could not rescue the women and children.
Mr Raza said the boat, which was overturned, had a capacity of only 40 to 45 passengers but 95 passengers were on board when it capsized.
He added a body was recovered on Tuesday and handed over to the family while further efforts to retrieve the remaining bodies will resume today.According to the RYK deputy commissioner, about 95-100 people were travelling on the boat when it met the accident in the river. Out of them, 45 people had been rescued in initial efforts; dead bodies of 22 were fished out by the rescue officials whereas 27 people remained missing till the filing of this report.
He said he had recomm­ended financial support for the families of the dece­ased but the decision rested with the Punjab government.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Adnan Shabbir told this correspondent that due to recent rains in the area, the passage to reach the accident spot was rough and they used tractors to transport their vehicles which delayed the rescue efforts.

1,Fafen seeks ‘parliamentary probe’ into PTI’s rigging allegations,Calls for stricter laws to ensure compliance with code of conduct and check any alleged misuse of govt resources and vote-buying.,"ISLAMABAD: Two days after the PTI secured a resounding win the in the hotly contested by-polls for 20 Punjab Assembly seats, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) — an amalgam of several NGOs working for transparent electoral processes — has called for a “conclusive parliamentary probe” into the rigging accusations levelled by the party’s chairman Imran Khan.
Despite the win, Mr Khan in his victory speech called for the resignation of Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja and expressed his reservations over the alleged use of state machinery to manipulate the polls.
Fafen’s report released on Tuesday called for the formation of a “parliamentary committee with representation from all political parties” to ascertain the veracity of these allegations.
The report added that the campaigns had become “increasingly acrimonious” as the election day neared, with the PTI centering its campaign on the allegations of corruption, use of state resources, and collusion of the state institutions. “Marred by an increasingly negative trend of name-calling and accusations, the campaigns reflected the inadequacy of the ECP to enforce the ‘Code of Conduct for Political Parties and Candidates’,” it said.
The report called for stricter laws to ensure compliance with the code of conduct and check any alleged misuse of government resources and vote-buying.
While giving its observations on the overall polling activity on July 17, the report noted that barring some incidents of violence, the process remained “relatively peaceful”. It also added that voters were carrying pieces of paper displaying the name or symbol of a contesting party or candidate at 21 of the observed polling stations.
These papers — provided by political parties to help polling officers search the voters’ names in electoral rolls — can compromise the secrecy of the vote, the report said, while calling it a violation of the Supreme Court’s order which banned the provision of such chits in 2012.
Barring a few instances, the report noted that the polling process inside the booths was “mostly compliant” with the procedural requirements.
Fafen observers reported that outside 337 (58 per cent) of the observed polling stations, campaign materials such as banners, posters and flags were seen, while the parties and/or candidates were seen providing transport to their voters outside 384 (67 per cent) of the observed polling stations.

2,Govt notifies ‘executive allowance’ for officers,Heavy fin­ancial benefit of up to 150pc notified for govt officers working in federal secretariat and ICT Field Administration.,"ISLAMABAD: Despite challenging fiscal position and poor economic indicators, the federal governm­ent has notified a heavy fin­ancial benefit — up to 150 per cent — through an ‘exe­cutive allowance’ for government officers working in the federal secretariat and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Field Administration.
According to a notification issued by the Finance Division on Tuesday night, there will be 150 per cent (1.5 times) raise in the running basic salaries of all the government officers in gra­de 17 to 22 with effect from July 1, 2022. After ap­­proval of this allowance, the top bureaucrats are expected to get a raise between Rs150,000 and Rs200,000.
This increase is in addition to the 15pc pay raise an­­nounced by the government in the federal budget passed by the National Assembly, only three weeks ago.
According to the notification, the allowance will be admissible to all the officers posted by the Establishment Division against sanctioned posts of section officers, de­­puty secretaries, joint secretaries, senior joint secretaries, additional secretaries, additional secretaries (in-charge), special secretaries and secretaries in the federal secretariat (ministries/divisions), PM Office and President’s Secretariat.
This allowance will also be admissible to officers po­­sted as ACs, additional DCs, DC and chief commissioner in ICT field administration.
“Those officers posted on deputation against posts identified in above shall not be entitled to draw deputation allowance as well as any other allowance or emoluments, by whatever name called, specific to their cadre or organisation,” said the notification, adding that those drawing “executive allowance” shall not be entitled to draw any of the existing Disparity Reduction Allowance.

3,PTI slams govt over rupee devaluation,"Imran says ""economic meltdown shows Sharifs never had any expertise in running economy or administration"".","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf despite its stunning victory in Punjab by-polls continued to take a hard line on the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), with its chairman and secretary general blaming the Shehbaz Sharif government for rupee devaluation and economic crisis.
While criticising the government over free fall of rupee and economic meltdown, PTI chairman Imran Khan on Tuesday tweeted, “When US regime conspiracy’s VoNC [vote of no-confidence] was tabled $ was at Rs178. Today it is Rs224 & in freefall despite IMF agreement. The economic meltdown shows Sharifs never had any expertise in running economy or administration. Their only expertise is looting, money laundering & getting NROs.”

 





 
Also, PTI secretary general and ex-minister Asad Umer said the system imposed through “unnatural and external intervention” was very destructive for Pakistan. The inept government miserably failed to stop the free fall of the rupee against dollar, as the rupee fell to an all-time low against the dollar for a second day in a row, which was currently trading at Rs221 in the inter-bank market, fearing it could reach Rs223, which was alarming, he explained.
He highlighted the need for “timely decisions” to control the fast-dwindling economic situation and rapid depreciation of rupee against the dollar, warning the powers that be that “irreparable damage” could occur to the country if steps were not taken on a war-footing basis to get rid of the “imposed system”.

Fawad says ‘new provincial govt’ may ban entry of Sana and Tarar to Punjab

“Every hour of this imported government was proving heavy on the country,” said the PTI leader.
Fawad hints at ban
Meanwhile, PTI senior vice president Fawad Chaudhry told a presser that after regaining power in Punjab on July 22, the new provincial government could ban the entry of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Punjab Home Minister Attaullah Tarar to the province.
He advised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to stay away from people like Rana Sanaullah, as an order for arrest of (Rana) and Atta Tarar could be issued. He asked the premier to take notice of Mr Sanaullah’s remarks that what Pervaiz Elahi would do if five MPAs didn’t show up on the day of vote.
He said Asif Ali Zardari was well aware that the Sharif government was on a ventilator and the power to send this government packing anytime rested with the PTI. He pointed out that the PTI could topple the federal government in a day if it wanted and that five MNAs belonging to the coalition were in contact with PTI. “We are giving leeway to PM Shehbaz to take the right decision on general elections,” he said.
“We can boldly ask President Arif Alvi to initiate a vote of no-confidence against the current government but we are giving it a chance,” he said.
Claiming that the ECP was biased against the PTI, Mr Chaudhry suggested Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja to resign, or else he would be shown the door eventually. He called for the formation of a new, credible ECP that had the support of all political parties.
Mr Chaudhry said the PTI was ready to speak to Shehbaz Sharif once he announced the date for general election. He demanded resignation of Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz in line with political traditions.
“Hamza Shehbaz should be ashamed. His party suffered a humiliating defeat, even Maryam Nawaz and Malik Ahmad accepted it. He should have tendered his resignation immediately after it,” he remarked.

4,PM urges ECP to release ‘long-delayed’ verdict in PTI funding case,ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to announce a...,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday urged the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to announce a “long-delayed judgement” in the prohibited funding case against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) that thumped the prime minister’s party to clinch 15 out of 20 seats in the by-polls held in Punjab on July 17.
“I urge the Election Commission of Pakistan to announce long-delayed judgement on PTI foreign funding case,” the prime minister tweeted as he referred to the case against PTI with its old name.
PM Sharif, who heads the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), also sought punishment for PTI Chairman Imran Khan in light of his rhetoric against state institutions.
“For long has Imran Niazi been given a free pass despite his repeated & shameless attacks on state institutions,” he said, adding that impunity given to Mr Khan had hurt the country.
Prohibited funding
The case, which was filed by Akbar S Babar, has been pending since Nov 14, 2014. Mr Babar, who was a founding member of the PTI, had alleged serious financial irregularities in the party’s funding from Pakistan and abroad. The PTI has denied any wrongdoing and maintained the funding is not from prohibited sources.
The ECP had reserved its verdict on the case last month which has not been issued yet. On January 4 this year, the ECP’s scrutiny committee, formed in March 2018 to examine the PTI’s foreign funding in one month, finally submitted its report after 95 hearings and nearly four years.
The report, based on eight volumes of record requisitioned through the State Bank of Pakistan, proved that the PTI leadership had committed gross violations of funding laws by allowing the collection of millions of dollars and billions of rupees without any source and details from foreigners, including Indian nationals and foreign companies.
APP ADDS: In his message on the day of Kashmir’s Accession to Pakistan, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that the oppressive Indian state apparatus had failed to stop the Kashmiris’ journey of resistance, sacrifice, and defiance.
Kashmiris across the globe mark the day on July 19 as a resolution for accession was passed on this historic date in Srinagar.
PM Shehbaz said that after the passage of the resolution for accession to Pakistan, the people of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan launched a big struggle for freedom.
He said Pakistan would continue to extend support to the Kashmiris until the realisation of their dream of holding a plebiscite in accordance with the resolutions of the Untied Nations and as per the aspirations of the people of the occupied valley.

• Mazari claims ‘voice recorder’ found in her bedroom, vows to move IHC against violation of her privacy
LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: Opposition allies, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and PML-Q, on Tuesday accused the coalition government of ‘misusing’ state machinery to harass, intimidate and spy on their lawmakers and leaders ahead of the run-off election for Punjab chief minister scheduled for July 22.
Accusing Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah of using the Intelligence Bureau (IB) to trace legislators and scare them into defection ahead of Friday’s vote, Punjab Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Parvez Elahi warned the agency to stay away from the fray.


Shireen Mazari

 
Addressing a press conference in Lahore, Elahi, a candidate for the highest office in the province against the incumbent Hamza Shehbaz, admonished IB Director General Fuad Asadullah for “tracking PML-Q and PTI lawmakers at the behest of Shehbaz Sharif and Sanaullah”.
Prime Minister Sharif, he alleged, had constituted a cell specifically for keeping a watch on rival MPAs as the chief minister’s election approaches.
Flanked by PTI leaders, he said: “I warn the IB head to stop this. They have lost the public trust and now they are resorting to such cheap tactics,” adding the interior minister will be exposed if he did anything unlawful.
Denying that any other elements were involved in the alleged “track and trace” operation, the PML-Q leader said: “Only the prime minister is doing it.” He further alleged that an overseas Pakistani businessman associated with the PML-Q had recently been picked up by the IB from the Lahore airport.
Speaking on the occasion, former PTI minister Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed told reporters his party had nominated Elahi for the Punjab chief ministership.
“A directive by party chief Imran Khan has been sent to all Punjab lawmakers to reach Lahore and ensure their presence for a meeting to be held on Wednesday (today). Imran Khan himself will reach the city today (Wednesday) and stay for two days. The PTI has the support of 188 MPAs while the PML-N has 173 to 174. This gap cannot be filled,” Mr Rasheed said, reiterating his party’s demand for free and fair polls, and warned the political situation would deteriorate further if there was any intervention in the elections.
PML-Q leader Amir Saeed Rawn claimed the man detained at the Lahore airport on June 19 “was forced to give a statement that Parvez Elahi is involved in money laundering”.
‘Bugging’ attempt
Meanwhile, PTI senior vice president Dr Shireen Mazari alleged that a domestic staff member at her residence in Islamabad found a voice recorder attached to a coffee table in her bedroom in an attempt to spy on her.
Addressing a press conference along with PTI Senator Shibli Faraz in the federal capital on Tuesday, Dr Mazari said a similar device had been recovered from party chief Imran Khan’s Banigala house a few days ago.
She said she was at Mr Khan’s residence when her personal secretary called her that a device had dropped from under a coffee table in her bedroom after a domestic help bumped into it.
Ms Mazari added she initially thought it was a USB, but upon investigation, it was found to be a “US-made voice recorder”, planted in her house to spy on her in sheer violation of Article 14(1) of the Constitution and her right to privacy.


Parvez Elahi

 
She questioned as to who had installed the device in her bedroom, after “kidnapping” her in May, adding that PTI workers were being harassed.
“The Constitution and law are being flouted and if a journalist speaks up, an FIR is registered against him/her, as four cases are filed against her,” she added. Mazari claimed that brutal tactics were being used to silence dissenting voices.
However, she vowed: “My right to privacy and protection has been violated. I am filing a constitutional petition in the Islamabad High Court against this unconstitutional act.”
She further claimed the employee who found the device was being threatened that his son would be killed, adding she wasn’t sure what information “they” were trying to get from her bedroom. She cautioned that the government and the state needed to realise the sensitivity of the situation because people were angry, as was evident from the results of the recent by-elections in Punjab.
The former human rights minister made it clear that no one could silence them through such tactics and that they would expose everyone behind such ‘dirty games’.
Speaking on the occasion, Senator Faraz said installing a device at Shireen Mazari’s house was alarming. “We don’t know how many other people are being spied on through such devices in their homes and offices,” he added.
Later, PTI Central Secretary General Asad Umar also said “bugging” Ms Mazari’s house showed how desperate the government was and how much it feared her. “Pakistan is under fascism,” he remarked.

6,Work on Reko Diq project to start in Aug,"Mine project will be developed in two phases; expected to create 4,000 long-term jobs.","

Barrick Gold CEO Mark Bristow talks to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Abdul Quddus Bizenjo.—APP

 
QUETTA: The development work on the Reko Diq gold and copper mining project, initially starting with a $7 billion investment, will begin on Aug 14, the 76th Independence Day, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo and Barrick Gold CEO Mark Bristow disclosed on Tuesday.
Speaking at a joint press conference at Chief Minister Secretariat, they said the Reko Diq project — a partnership between the company, the provincial government and Pakistan’s state-owned enterprises — would be a gift for the province.
The presser came a day after the Canadian mining firm said it expected parliament and the Supreme Court to sanction its $6 billion out-of-court settlement on international arbitration to pave the way for a $7bn investment in Reko Diq.
The Reko Diq mine project will be developed in two phases, starting with a plant that will be able to process around 40 million tonnes of ore per year. It could be doubled in five years following the first production from phase one.

Project expected to create 4,000 long-term jobs

Mr Bristow said the project was expected to employ 7,500 people during the peak construction stage and would create 4,000 long-term jobs after the start of production.
Balochistan’s shareholding in Reko Diq would be fully funded by its partners and the federal government, which meant that the province would reap the dividends, royalties and other benefits of its 25 per cent ownership without having to contribute financially to construction and operation of the mine.
The Barrick Gold CEO said the company’s social contributions were currently estimated at around $70 million over the construction period, including upfront commitments of up to $3m in the first year after closing and up to $7m in the second year,” he said.
Besides, Reko Diq would advance royalties to the government of Balochistan of up to $5m in the first year after closing, up to $7.5m in the second and up to $10m per year until commercial production starts, subject to a cumulative $50m maximum of advance payments.
Subject to the updated feasibility study, Reko Diq is envisaged as a conventional open-pit and milling operation, producing a high-quality copper-gold concentrate.
In the press conference, Chief Minister Bizenjo said the federal government had agreed with the provincial government’s proposals regarding the Reko Diq project and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accepted all the demands that pertained to protecting the rights of the people of Balochistan.
