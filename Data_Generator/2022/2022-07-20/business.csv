0,Rupee hits record low against dollar at 222,"SBP attributes 11-rupee change in exchange rate in just two days to ""market-determined exchange rate system"".","KARACHI: Political unrest wreaked havoc on the currency market for the second consecutive day as the rupee dropped 3.06 per cent on Tuesday to an all-time low of 221.99 in interbank trading.
The national currency traded as high as 224 against the dollar on the open market.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) attributed the 11-rupee change in the exchange rate in just two days to the “market-determined exchange rate system” under which the current account position, news stories and domestic uncertainty contribute to the daily currency fluctuations.
In an apparent attempt to downplay the depreciation, the SBP said a “better measure” of the rupee’s strength is the real effective exchange rate, which takes into account the currencies in which Pakistan trades in inflation-adjusted terms.
The central bank said the depreciation in the rupee “since December 2021 has only been 3pc”. In nominal terms, however, the local currency has depreciated against the dollar by 18pc over the same period.
The US Federal Reserve has increased interest rates in the recent past to combat inflation, which is hovering at a 40-year high. As a result, international funds are flowing into the US economy to earn better returns. This has led to an increase in demand for dollars, propelling the greenback to a 20-year high against a basket of peers.
“There’s a strong perception in the currency market that any abrupt change in the existing political setup may put the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme in jeopardy,” said Syed Atif Zafar, CEO of Uraan Ltd, an economic research house.
Any change in government at the federal level can possibly delay the IMF disbursement, which will also put at risk the expected flows from “friendly countries” as well as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other multilateral institutions, he added.
The government expects inflows of as much as $4bn from these unnamed friendly countries to help bridge its financing gap in 2022-23. The country’s gross financing requirements for the current fiscal year are north of $33bn.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan General Secretary Zafar Paracha said the sharp fluctuation appears to be a result of some “IMF condition” that the government seems to have agreed to.
“If the exchange rate was deteriorating because of poor economic numbers alone, its movement wouldn’t be zigzagged,” he said.
The rupee appreciated to 204.56 in the first week of July after touching 211.93 on June 22. It kept losing its value against the dollar but registered a minor appreciation when the country reached its staff-level agreement with the IMF on July 15.
“It’s the national currency, not the stock price of a small-time company that goes up and down on alternate days,” said Mr Paracha.
The rupee depreciates every year as the dollar outflow on account of import payments always outpaces the inward movement of the US currency in the shape of export proceeds and remittances etc. In 2021-22, the country recorded its highest-ever trade deficit, or the gap between dollar payments and receipts. It widened 55.7pc year-on-year to $48.4bn in the last fiscal year, according to the latest data issued by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
In a statement released on Tuesday, Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry’s acting president Suleman Chawla said the volatility in the rupee-dollar parity has pushed “many factories” to the brink of closure. “This should be treated as an economic emergency from all stakeholders,” he said.

1,"KSE 100-share index tumbles by 978 points, equity prices fall to 12-year low","Investors continue selling momentum across the board owing to unrest on political front, devaluation of rupee, says analyst.","KARACHI: Politics took a heavy toll on the equity market on Tuesday as the dollar-based value of all listed shares dropped to a 12-year low.
Market capitalisation in dollars declined nearly five per cent on a day-on-day basis to $30.7 billion — lowest since June 2010 — on account of “rising political and economic problems,” according to Topline Securities.
Investors continued their overnight selling momentum across the board owing to the unrest on the political front and the devaluation of the rupee, which reached historic lows in the interbank and open markets, said Arif Habib Ltd.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 40,389.07 points, down 978.04 points or 2.36pc from a day ago. The index shed 708 points in the week’s first trading session on Monday.
The trading volume increased 28.8pc to 194.9 million shares while the traded value went up 32.7pc to $26.1m on a day-on-day basis.



 
Speaking to Dawn, JS Global AVP Mubashir Anis said the primary reason for the fall in share prices is growing political uncertainty. “Investors are getting jittery about political developments derailing the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme and other multilateral flows expected to materialise afterwards.”
He insisted that the fundamentals of listed companies remain strong. Some import-dependent businesses may be more exposed to sudden movements in the exchange rate, but that doesn’t justify the broad-based selling in the stock market, he added.
Mr Anis said the market requires clarity on the IMF programme and the overall macro landscape to calm the jitters and unlock the attractive valuations.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Electric Ltd (19.62m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (17.67m sha­res), Cnergyico PK Ltd (9.96m shares), Cordoba Logistics and Ventures Ltd (7.94m shares) and Unity Foods Ltd (7.47m shares).
Sectors that took away the highest number of points from the benchmark index included commercial banking (236.12 points), oil and gas exploration (139.97 points), fertiliser (131.05 points), cement (99.93 points) and power generation and distribution (57.26 points).
Shares contributing most negatively to the index included Meezan Bank Ltd (60.73 points), Engro Corporation Ltd (58.11 points), the Hub Power Company Ltd (56.44 points), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (47.81 points) and Habib Bank Ltd (43.47 points).
Stocks that contributed most positively to the index included Packages Ltd (3.55 points), Nestle Pakistan Ltd (2.14 points), Abbott Laboratories Pakistan Ltd (1.99 points), Kot Addu Power Company Ltd (1.27 points) and First Habib Modaraba (0.82 points).
Foreign investors were net buyers as they purcha­sed shares worth $1.26m. On the local front, mutual funds and insurance companies sold shares worth $3.17m and $1.39m, respectively.

2,"Oil, food import bill jumps 64pc to $32.3bn","Increase attributed to high international prices, rupee depreciation; textile exports rise 26pc to $19.3bn during FY22.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s oil and eatable import bill surged by 64 per cent to $32.32bn in the FY22 compared to $19.69bn in the preceding fiscal year owing to higher international prices and massive depreciation of the rupee.
While the textile and clothing exports also grew 25.53pc year-on-year to $19.32bn on the back of a steady rise in global demand.
Data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday showed the import of medicinal products went up 192.29pc to $4.06bn in the FY22 against $1.39bn. This is one of the major increases in imports of one sector mainly due to an increase in import of Covid-19 vaccines.
The import bill of oil increased by over 105.31pc to $23.31bn in FY22 from $11.35bn over the corresponding months of last year.

Textile exports rise 26pc to $19.3bn during previous fiscal year

Further breakup showed that the import of petroleum products went up by 133.90pc in value and 28.28pc in quantity. Crude oil imports rose by 80.18pc in value and a 5.26pc in quantity during the period under review while those of liquefied natural gas increased by 90.65pc in value. Liquefied petroleum gas imports jumped by 39.70pc in value in FY22.
The food import bill rose by over 8pc to $9.01bn in FY22 from $8.34bn in FY21 to bridge the local production gap. Within the food group, the major contribution came from wheat, sugar, edible oil, spices, tea and pulses.
The machinery import bill increased by 7.63pc to $10.92bn in FY22 against $10.14bn in the same period last year. The major contribution came from the import of electrical machinery and mobile phones.
The mobile phone imports were slightly down by 4.19pc YoY to $1.97bn in FY22. The arrival of apparatus of mobile phones posted YoY growth of 33.65pc to $705.94m.
Textile exports
The PBS data showed that the textile and clothing exports grew just by 2.86pc year-on-year in June. High energy cost was one of the reasons for the slowdown in textile exports in the last month of FY22.
The government has recently announced the much-awaited textile and apparel policy pending for the last few years.
In the budget 2021-22, the government drastically reduced duties and taxes on the imports of several hundred raw materials to bring down the input cost of exportable products. Liquidity issues were also resolved to a considerable extent by a timely release of refunds and the payment of cash subsidies.
Data showed that ready-made garments exports jumped 28.75pc in value and 49.43pc in quantity for FY22, while the exports of knitwear edged up 34.23pc in value and a decline of 5.45pc in quantity.

3,Nepra gets nod for Rs11 per unit hike,Will complete formality of public hearing on Wednesday for immediate implementation of new rates.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has asked the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) to allow increasing electricity rates by up to Rs11 per unit for high-end residential consumers across the country to bear the additional burden of consumers with lower consumption.
The rate approved by the federal government under the “tariff rebasing 2022-23” for consumers with a monthly consumption slab of 101-200 units and above is significantly higher than the Rs7.91 per unit increase in the uniform national average determined by the regulator a few weeks ago.
Besides the massive cross-subsidisation among various consumer slabs, the government would still be providing Rs234 billion in subsidies — Rs220bn for distribution companies of ex-Wapda and Rs14bn for K-Electric (KE) — to finance the tariff rebasing cost of poor consumers, according to the Power Division’s request to the regulator.
It said the request was based on government approval “in anticipation of approval of the cabinet” to modify the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) decision to the extent that “consumers consuming less than 100 units and falling in the non-protected category shall be charged Rs13.48/unit instead of Rs19.56/unit and that the consequential revenue differential shall be adjusted in various categories”. The ECC approved a Rs3.50 per unit increase in base tariff in July, followed by Rs3.50 in August-September and the remaining Rs1 per unit in October billing.

Higher consumption categories to take bulk of the burden

The government has told the regulator that it wanted to increase power rates for consumers of the “unprotected category” using up to 100 units per month by about Rs4.06 per unit instead of Rs7.91 worked out by Nepra, and hence this burden has to be passed on to the higher consumption categories.
This has been done to address a tariff anomaly. Under the existing tariff scheme, consumers using less than 200 units for a continuous six preceding months are categorised as “protected” and their tariff will remain unchanged. On the other hand, those with the first 100 units slip into the ‘unprotected’ category if their consumption exceeds the benchmark even for a month. Their rates will now be raised in stages by Rs4.06 per unit to Rs13.48 per unit for the current fiscal year.
Under the government directive, the base tariff for those consuming 101-200 would be increased by Rs7.21 per unit in phases to Rs18.95, while the rate for 201-300 per month would go up by Rs8.31 to Rs22.14 per unit. The rate for 301-400 units would increase by Rs4.30 per unit to Rs25.53, while the rate for 401-500 units would increase by Rs6.51 per unit to Rs27.74.
Likewise, the base rate for 501-600 units will increase to Rs29.16 per unit, up by Rs7.93, and that of 601-700 units will go up to Rs30.30 per unit, showing an increase of Rs8.97 per unit.
The base tariff for consumption above 700 units per month would go up to Rs35.22 per unit, with an increase of Rs11 per unit. The base rate for time of use (TOU) meters would go up by Rs10.06 to Rs34.39 for peak consumption hours and to Rs28.07 per unit for off-peak hours.
The Nepra will complete the formality of a public hearing on Wednesday as required under a court order to adjust tariff subsidies allocated by the federal government for immediate implementation as required under the IMF conditionality.

4,Picanto sells for what Civic cost in 2019,"Price of two models of 1,000cc Picanto has been raised by Rs5m to Rs3.1m and Rs3.2m.","KARACHI: Lucky Motor Corporation Ltd (LMCL) has emerged as the first company to pass on the huge impact of rupee’s devaluation by raising prices by up to Rs1.1 million. 
In a circular to its authorised dealers on Tuesday, the company said the price of two models of 1,000cc Picanto (manual and automatic including capital value tax) has been raised by Rs5m to Rs3.1 million and Rs3.2m — a price tag carried by 1,800cc Honda Civic some three years ago in June 2019. 
The three models of Sportage (Alpha, FWD and AWD) now cost Rs6.250m, Rs6.750m and Rs7.250m compared to  Rs5.535m, Rs5.858m and Rs6.363m earlier.
The new price of Stonic EX and EXplus models is Rs4.545m and Rs4.848m as compared to Rs4.469m and Rs4.772m. Sorento 2.4LFWD, 2.4LAWD and 3.5L will be sold at Rs7.800m, Rs8.500m and Rs8.5m as compared to Rs6.904m, Rs7.573m and Rs7.573m.
Carnival GLS PP rate is now Rs12.599m versus Rs11.499m.
The company said the new prices would not apply to customers who had already made the full payment 
by July 18 as well as those customers who were given commitments for provisional delivery in June or before.
LMCL said the booking of Picanto manual, Stonic, Sorento and Carnival is open for which the customers need to make full payment of booking. However, the company has still put on hold the booking of Picanto automatic and Sportage (FWD and AWD models).
After a price jump by an assembler, others would soon also follow the suit. An assembler said he cannot predict anything specific about the price jump after a huge rally in the dollar on Tuesday and an uncertain future of dollar-rupee parity.
Besides, Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL), despite maintaining positive growth in sales, has discontinued production of GS150SE (special edition) motorcycle from July 16, 2022, while production of the standard version would continue. The company, in its circular to its authorised dealers, did not give any reason for halting its production.

5,Ahsan Iqbal seeks early approval of IMF staff agreement,"IMF’s communication director says executive board, which will approve the loan package, likely to meet in three to six weeks.","WASHINGTON: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal has underscored Pakistan’s continued commitment to the International Monetary Fund’s programme, hoping that this would encourage the IMF to give early approval to its staff agreement with Islamabad.
In a meeting with Deputy Managing Director Antoinette M. Sayeh on Monday, the minister also sought the IMF’s assistance to the country’s agriculture sector, especially to mitigate the impact of climate change.
Currently on a US tour to seek support for the country’s failing economy, the minister spent a week in New York, meeting UN officials and representatives of key member states. Now in Washington, Ahsan Iqbal is also assuring the US administration to continue supporting the current setup in Pakistan which, he says, “is here to stay.”
The US media, however, has prominently reported the ruling coalition’s defeat in the by-election, noting that the consequent political instability had caused the currency to sink to a record new low of Rs. 222 to a dollar.
The minister, however, continued to project Pakistan as a stable economy, which offers enormous investment opportunities.
“Pakistan with its huge market, modern infrastructure and a unique geo-location offers great opportunities to the US businesses and tech entrepreneurs to undertake profitable business ventures and create a win-win partnership,” Ahsan Iqbal told a delegation of the US-Pakistan Business Council at the Pakistan embassy in Washington.
In his meeting with the IMF’s deputy managing director, he also underlined the difficult economic and fiscal decisions the government had taken to unfreeze the remaining tranches of a $6bn IMF package. “We did so because Pakistan’s economic stability and socio-economic development of its people is our first priority,” he said.
Some reports in the US media, however, noted that those difficult decisions had contributed to the government’s unpopularity, hurting it in the by-elections, and possibly in the national election as well.
The IMF and Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement last week that they hoped would stabilise the country’s economy and depreciating currency. The IMF also hoped that it would bring down high inflation and end Pakistan’s political instability.
IMF’s Communication Director Gerry Rice said at a news briefing on Thursday that the executive board, which would approve the package, is likely to meet in three to six weeks. He noted that the staff-level agreement brought the total disbursements from the IMF to Pakistan under the ongoing program to about $4.2 billion.
Ms Sayeh acknowledged the government’s efforts for the successful conclusion of the staff agreement and assured the minister that the IMF would continue to play its role in stabilising Pakistan’s economy.
