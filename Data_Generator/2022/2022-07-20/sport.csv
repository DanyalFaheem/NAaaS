Phillips was unbeaten in his 52-ball innings as he smashed seven boundaries in New Zealand’s total of 173 for eight.
Jimmy Neesham kept the runs flowing for New Zealand with a rapid 29 which included a towering six into the sightscreen.
Ferguson turned the screw on Ireland in their chase with impressive figures of 4-14 as the hosts were bowled out for 142 in 18.2 overs.
Ireland, who just missed out on a first ever victory over New Zealand when they lost the final ODI by one run last week, elected to field first in Dublin.It had looked a solid call when New Zealand opener Finn Allen fell for one in the third over off Joshua Little, who finished with four wickets.
Martin Guptill (24) soon followed after he holed out at long off and Dane Cleaver (five) lasted only seven deliveries on his debut, nicking a length ball from Little behind.
Daryl Mitchell was also dismissed for five off Curtis Campher to leave the tourists struggling at 54 for four in the ninth over.
Phillips nipped Ireland’s threat in the bud with his flamboyant stroke-play and New Zealand got an early breakthrough in the field when Mitchell Santner claimed a fine catch to dismiss Andy Balbirnie for 12.
Black Caps skipper Santner took two wickets with the ball to reduce Ireland to 69 for five in the 10th over.
Campher (29) and Mark Adair (25) gave Ireland faint hope, but Ferguson ensured the chase proved too much for the hosts.

1,Abdullah hundred keeps Pakistan on course in big chase at Galle,GALLE: Pakistan’s Abdullah Abdullah smashed his second Test hundred to put the tourists on course to accomplish a...,"GALLE: Pakistan’s Abdullah Abdullah smashed his second Test hundred to put the tourists on course to accomplish a mammoth chase on day four of the opening Test against Sri Lanka in Galle on Tuesday.
Pakistan finished on 222-3 needing 120 runs to grab the lead in the two-Test series.
Sri Lanka had appeared to have the upper hand in the contest after they posted 337 in their second innings setting Pakistan a daunting target of 342.
Abdullah combined with Imam-ul-Haq (35) in an opening stand of 87 and later raised 101 with skipper Babar Azam (55) in a vastly improved batting display by the tourists who were skittled out for 218 in the first innings. 
“He is one of the best players, so he provided good support while batting and guided me all along on how to play,” Abdullah, who called his ton a  “special one”, said of captain Babar. 
“So was not a good thing when he got out but now the responsibility lies on me.”
Left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya bowled talisman Babar around the batter’s legs with a delivery that spun sharply from outside leg to rattle the stumps of the right-hander, who looked visibly shocked.
Wicket-keeper/batter Mohammad Rizwan was batting on seven at stumps alongside Abdullah, who had so far faced 289 balls and hit five boundaries and one six.
Pakistan began strongly with Abdullah and Imam’s partnership, but an alert stumping from wicket-keeper Niroshan Dickwella broke the stand.
The left-handed Imam missed a delivery from off-spinner Ramesh Mendis and Dickwella clipped off the bails, with the decision going up to the third umpire.
Various TV angles established that Imam’s foot was just millimetres off the ground when the bails were dislodged.
Azhar Ali was the next to go when he edged a ball from Jayasuriya, who claimed a five-wicket haul in the previous innings, to first slip. He made six off 32 deliveries.
Babar, who hit a defiant 119 in Pakis­tan’s first innings, then joined Abdullah as the two rebuilt the innings on a turning pitch.
Babar reached his fifty and two balls later Abdullah got his second Test hundred with a single off Maheesh Theekshana, raising his bat to a standing ovation from the dressing room. 
“All of a sudden the wicket went flat... still we kept them under three runs and we did a marvellous job on that track,” Sri Lanka’s spin coach Piyal Wijetunga told reporters.
“We are still in the game. If we grab two wickets in the morning session we have a great chance of winning this game.” 
Babar, who crossed 10,000 international runs on day two and averages over 45, went past 3,000 Test runs during another stubborn knock in which he hit Jayasuriya for a few boundaries and one six.
Abdullah also hit his only six against Jayasuriya and said things went to plan. 
“We have just one plan in mind and that is to go after Jayasuriya,” said Abdullah. 
“He has done well in the first innings and if we figure him out well here then we have a pretty good chance of batting well against them.” 
Sri Lanka took the second new ball in the 81st over but the spinners kept up the attack in the tense final overs of the day.
In the morning, Sri Lanka resumed the day on 329-9 in their second innings.
Dinesh Chandimal was stranded on 94 when they were all out for 337.

2,Yasir ripper evokes memories of Warne’s ‘ball of the century’,Sri Lanka’s Mendis had reached 76 on the third day in Galle when Yasir pitched one outside leg stump.,"GALLE: A Yasir Shah delivery was drawing comparisons with Shane Warne’s “ball of the century” on Tuesday, the day after the Pakistan leg-spinner ripped out Kusal Mendis.
Sri Lanka’s Mendis had reached 76 on the third day in Galle when Yasir pitched one outside leg stump only for it to take huge turn and hit the top of the shell-shocked batter’s off stump.
The dismissal had echoes of the late great Warne’s magical delivery to remove England’s bamboozled Mike Gatting during the first Ashes Test at Old Trafford in 1993. 
“While it will be difficult to surpass Warne’s stunning ball, Yasir certainly went close as he produced a delivery that is sure to be talked about over the coming years,” wrote the International Cricket Council.
Sri Lanka Cricket on their Twitter page said: “Ball of the Century candidate? Yasir Shah stunned Kusal Mendis with a stunning delivery which reminded the viewers of Shane Warne’s ‘Ball of the Century’.” 

 





 
Warne, who died aged 52 of a suspected heart attack in March, ended his stellar Test career in 2007 with 708 Test wickets.

3,China to host Asian Games in 2023 after Covid postponement,"The event was originally scheduled to be held in September this year, but organisers in May postponed it.","KUWAIT CITY: China will host the 2022 Asian Games in 2023, organisers said on Tuesday, after postponing the event in Hangzhou because of Covid-19.
The Games will now be held in Hangzhou from September 23 to October 8 2023, the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) said. 
The event was originally scheduled to be held in September this year, but organisers in May postponed it as China tried to stamp out a large Covid resurgence in several parts of the country and the OCA Executive Board (EB) subsequently set up a task force to determine new dates. 
Hangzhou lies less than 200 kilometres (120 miles) from the country’s biggest city Shanghai, which endured a months-long lockdown earlier this year as part of the ruling Communist Party’s zero-tolerance approach to the virus. 
The OCA said on Tuesday that the new dates were chosen to avoid “conflict with other major international sporting events”. 
“The task force over the last two months held various discussions with the Chinese Olympic Committee, Hangzhou Asian Games Organising Committee and other stakeholders to find a window for the Games which did not conflict with other major international sporting events,” the OCA said in a statement. “The recommended dates by the task force were duly approved by the OCA EB.” 
The governing body thanked the Chinese organisers and the government “for their hard work in preparing for the Games during the pandemic and ensuring they can take place next year.” 
The Asian Games, second in size only to the Summer Olympics, typically attract over 10,000 athletes from across the region. 
China is the last major economy committed to stamping out domestic spread of the virus through harsh lockdowns, mass testing and strict controls on international travel. 
But that has hurt the country’s international sporting ambitions, with the world’s most populous nation cancelling or postponing almost all events since the start of the pandemic, with the exception of this year’s Winter Olympics in Beijing. 
The World University Games, scheduled to begin in June in Chengdu and already delayed from last year, have also been postponed again, until 2023.

Pakistan was looking to host the South Asian Games during September and October next year but the OCA announcement to hold the Hangzhou Asian Games, postponed due to Covid-19 last year, from Sept 23 to Oct 8 means Pakistan’s wait to hold its first South Asian Games since 2004 will extend by another year.
The Pakistan Olympic Association’s initial preference to hold the South Games was in March next year but the delay in finalising issues surrounding the host cities with the Pakistan Sports Board saw them settle on hosting the event in September-October 2023.
The POA will now hold a meeting to set new dates for the hosting of the South Asian extravaganza.
“Definitely after the new dates of Asian Games are set to fall in September-October next year, it is not possible for Pakistan to host the games in the same period so we will likely shift them to March 2024,” POA secretary Khalid Mahmood told Dawn. “Soon the POA will hold a meeting with the national sports federations to review the situation and to finalise any new dates.”

5,Vingegaard shadows Pogacar to stay in control on Tour de France,"Overall, Thomas is still third, 2:43 behind Vingegaard.","FOIX: Tadej Pogacar went on the offensive as promised but was never in a position to unsettle the Tour de France overall leader Jonas Vingegaard in the first of three key mountain stages on Tuesday.
The defending champion attacked twice on the ascent to the Port de Lers (11.4km at 7%) and once in the descent but yellow jersey holder Vingegaard shadowed him to retain his lead of two minutes and 22 seconds.
The stage was won by Hugo Houle, the first Canadian to win on the Tour since Steve Bauer in 1988, from the day’s breakaway after the Israel Premier Tech rider went solo in the last climb, the punishing Mur de Peguere (9.4km at 7.9%).
Houle did not look back in the long descent into Foix to beat France’s Valentin Madouas of Groupama-FDJ and his compatriot and Israel Premier Tech team-mate Michael Woods, who were second and third respectively, one minute and 10 seconds behind, for his first professional victory.
“I never won a race! When I attacked it was basically to set the table for Michael Woods, and when I saw that they let me go I just went all, full gas, and at the end I was hanging on and hanging on,” said Houle.
“I won this stage for my brother who died when I turned professional , I won it for him, today I got the win for him, it’s incredible I don’t know what to say, I’m so happy.”  In the group of favourites, Pogacar’s first brutal attack some 2.5km from the top of the Port de Lers caught Vingegaard off guard, but the Dane reined him in almost effortlessly.
He stayed on the Slovenian’s wheel when the 23-year-old went again as the yellow jersey group was dropped down to a dozen riders.
Far behind, one of Pogacar’s key team-mates, Marc Soler, was dropped after he was sick by the roadside and the Spaniard finished outside the time limit.
Pogacar’s last attempt to attack came just after riders started their descent but once again, Vingegaard easily covered the move.
In the ascent to the Mur de Peguere, Pogacar’s UAE team-mate Rafal Majka set a fast pace to further slim down the group but the Pole’s chain snapped and he had to make way for Vingegaard’s Jumbo Visma team-mate Sepp Kuss.
The American climber set a blinding pace that prevented Pogacar from attacking again while Geraint Thomas, the 2018 champion, was dropped, as well as Romain Bardet who had started the day in fourth place overall.
Thomas bridged the gap in the descent after holding on for dear life in the climb but Bardet had long disappeared from his rear-view mirror.
The Frenchman lost almost all hope of finishing on the podium in Paris on Sunday as he slipped down to ninth overall, after losing 3:36.
Overall, Thomas is still third, 2:43 behind Vingegaard.
Colombian Nairo Quintana, a two-time Tour runner-up, moved up to fourth, 4:15 off the pace with France’s David Gaudu jumping up to fifth a further nine seconds behind.
The overall standings could be shaken up again on Wednesday when the 17th stage takes the peloton for a 130-km ride between Saint Gaudens and Peyragudes with three brutal climbs.

6,Stokes hopes ODI retirement serves as a warning to cricket,CHESTER LE STREET: Ben Stokes said on Tuesday he hopes his retirement from One-day Internationals will serve as a...,"CHESTER LE STREET: Ben Stokes said on Tuesday he hopes his retirement from One-day Internationals will serve as a warning to cricket chiefs over an increasingly congested global schedule, with the all-rounder insisting players “are not cars, you can’t just fill us up”.
Stokes was a central figure in England’s 2019 World Cup final triumph, their greatest moment in 50-over cricket.
But Stokes is making his 105th and final ODI appearance against South Africa on Tuesday — a match taking place at his Durham home ground.
Test captain Stokes announced his ODI retirement on Monday with a notably pointed comment that England’s current fixture schedule was “unsustainable” and that he could no longer give of his best in all three international formats.
Stokes, who will continue to play Tests and T20 internationals, expanded on his decision to step away from the one-day game during a pre-match interview where he warned other players could follow his example.
“The more cricket that is played, the better for the sport, but you want a product that is of the highest quality,” he told BBC Radio’s Test Match Special. 
“You want the best players to be playing as much as you possibly can, all the time. 
“It isn’t just me or us, you see it all around the world now where teams are having to rest some players in a certain series so they feel like they are getting a break. 
“We are not cars, you can’t just fill us up and we’ll go out there and be ready to be fuelled up again.” Stokes, 31, added: “I just feel like there is too much cricket rammed in for people to play all three formats now.” 
Tuesday’s game came midway through a gruelling England programme of 12 white-ball fixtures in 25 days this month, with the Test team playing seven matches in the 2022 home season.
Stokes, highlighting a fixture pile-up that saw England’s three-match ODI series away to the Netherlands take place in the brief gap between the second and third Tests against New Zealand, added: “We had a Test series and then the one-day team had a series going on at the same time — that was a bit silly.” 
Stokes said his retirement from ODIs, three years on from his player-of-the-match display in England’s World Cup triumph and just over 12 months from their title defence in India, had come earlier than expected. 
“With me being captain of the Test team and how much cricket we have coming up, I do have to look after my body... But hopefully when I am 35 or 36 and still playing Test cricket I’ll be very happy with this decision I have made.” 
England’s Test form has been revitalised under Stokes and new red-ball coach Brendon McCullum.
Since the pair took charge, England have swept a three-Test series against New Zealand before defeating India in the final match of a Covid-delayed series. 
“Him bowling is actually the thing he wants to be able to do, he doesn’t just want to go and be a batter, he wants to be able to contribute as an all-rounder,” Key said. 
“I’m hoping and I’m betting that this is what gets him up to 120-plus Test matches.”

Kenyan runner Faith Kipyegon was also among multiple gold medallists from the Tokyo Olympics who followed up on their efforts in the Japanese capital with more podium-topping. 
Morocco’s Soufiane El Bakkali backed up his Tokyo 3,000 metres steeplechase win by ending Kenya’s dominance at the worlds, while Qatar’s Mutaz Barshim had high jump gold all to himself this time. 
Rojas dominated the triple jump from start to finish and cruised to gold after jumping 15.47m. Jamaican Shanieka Ricketts collected her second consecutive world silver while American Tori Franklin delighted the home crowd by clinching bronze. 
“This is my third consecutive world [outdoor] title, it still hasn’t sunk in yet,” said Rojas, who had been hoping to better her world record but was frustrated by wind affecting her run-up. “I wanted a longer jump, but I am happy to return to this beautiful stadium, to see the crowd.” 
Kipyegon, winner of the last two Olympic 1,500m titles, finished with a remarkable time of three minutes, 52.96 seconds to regain her world crown. 
Ethiopia’s Gudaf Tsegay took silver while Laura Muir, runner-up at the Tokyo Olympics, won bronze to collect Britain’s first medal of the championship. 
“I have to say I am thankful for my second gold medal,” said Kipyegon, who won the 2017 title and picked up silver in 2019, a year after having a baby. 
In the steeplechase, El Bakkali produced a tactical masterclass to win his first world title and keep a Kenyan off top spot for the first time since 2005. 
Lamecha Girma of Ethiopia, silver medallist in Tokyo, finished runner-up while 2019 world champion Conseslus Kipruto of Kenya won bronze. 
Qatar’s Barshim, who famously shared Olympic gold with Italy’s Gianmarco Tamberi last year, won an unprecedented third straight world high jump title after clearing a world-leading 2.37m with ease. 
World indoor champion Woo Sang-hyeok of South Korea took silver and Ukraine’s Andriy Protsenko collected bronze. 
“Winning for the third time has never been done before,” he said. “For me that’s a great stat. I always say to myself, ‘How do you want to be remembered?’ I want to do great things, I want to be the high jumper that does stuff that sticks in history. I’ve done that today so I’m really happy about it.”
Double Olympic champion Nafissatou Thiam of Belgium pulled out a last-gasp victory over Dutch rival Anouk Vetter to reclaim her world heptathlon title. 
Vetter, who finished behind Thiam in Tokyo, had to settle for silver again while American Anna Hall won bronze. 
In the morning session, Gotytom Gebreslase won the women’s marathon in a world championship-record time of two hours, 18.11 minutes and claim a second marathon title for Ethiopia in Eugene after Tamirat Tola triumphed in the men’s event on Sunday. 
“Tola’s win yesterday motivated me a lot today,” said Gebreslase, who finished ahead of Kenya’s Judith Korir while Lonah Salpeter of Israel secured bronze. 
Three Japanese athletes and one coach tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday, taking the total number of cases in the delegation up to 15. 
Organisers have made it mandatory for all workforce, technical and medical officials and media to wear masks in indoor spaces as a cautionary measure.

8,Smith to oversee new South African T20 league,JOHANNESBURG: Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith was on Tuesday named as the head of a new Twenty20 franchise...,"JOHANNESBURG: Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith was on Tuesday named as the head of a new Twenty20 franchise tournament to be staged in the republic in January and February next year.
The announcement was made by Cricket South Africa (CSA) six days after it revealed it had withdrawn from a scheduled World Cup Super League one-day international series in Australia in January, which would have clashed with the new tournament.
CSA and South African television company SuperSport are the major shareholders in the league, which is intended to be a major money-spinner for cash-strapped national body.
Reports from India claim the league will in effect be an offshoot of the Indian Premier League, with IPL owners having bought six franchises in South Africa.
The CSA statement on 41-year-old Smith’s appointment did not give any detail about ownership of the franchises but said one of Smith’s first tasks would be “to develop the brand and confirm the participating franchises for the cricket fest to take place annually in South Africa.” 
Smith, who retired as a player in 2014, did not renew his contract as CSA director of cricket when it expired in March but it was widely speculated that he would be involved with the T20 project. 
“I’m extremely honoured to be entrusted with leading this exciting new venture. I’m deeply committed to South African cricket and happy to serve the game as best I can,” Smith said. 
“I’m excited by the opportunity to deliver the new league which I believe will be an extremely competitive product, one that can bring the much-needed investment into the game and provide new opportunities for players around the world and more importantly to our South African home-grown talent.” 
A spokesperson for CSA said he could not confirm the reports out of India which named Mumbai Indians, Chennai Super Kings, Lucknow Super Giants, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Capitals as buyers of South African franchises.
CSA said when it announced its withdrawal from the one-day series in Australia that it wanted its leading players to be available for the new league.
South Africa forfeited the Super League points available for the Australia series and as a consequence may be unable to qualify automatically for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. 
“This new league promises to make a significant investment into both professional cricket and 
development in South Africa, along with a positive socio-economic and tourism injection into the country.” the CSA’s chief executive Pholetsi Mosekisaid.

Batter Warner was barred from holding any leadership position in the Australian game for life because of his leading role in the infamous Newlands ball-tampering scandal of 2018.
Current Test skipper Pat Cummins is among those who have called for the Cricket Australia bar to be rescinded, saying he “fundamentally” disagreed with the concept of a ban that failed to recognise that people can learn and improve. 
“He obviously had a central role in what happened but he was not the only one that was involved and I don’t know why he should be treated any differently,” Chappell told Fox Sports News on Tuesday. 
“He’s served his punishment, he is a good leader in the side and not doubt if he had had the opportunity, I’m sure he would have captained the side quite well. 
“I think he’s paid his penalty and it’s time to open it up for leadership roles.”  
Warner and Steve Smith, the vice-captain and captain of the Test side at the time of the ball-tampering incident, were both banned from elite cricket for a year.
Smith was banned from leadership roles for only a further year and was named vice-captain of the Test team ahead of the 2021-22 Ashes series.
Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley said last week that although Warner was an “outstanding” leader in the side there were no plans to rescind the ban.

In a meeting held in Terrassa, Spain, on the occasion of the ongoing FIH Hockey Women’s World Cup, the FIH executive board thanked and congratulated both local organising committees, participating teams, officials and volunteers for putting together such a successful event.
Furthermore, regarding the current situation with Hockey India, the FIH would send an official communication to the Committee of Administrators of Hockey India with a request to have elections for India’s hockey governing body held as soon as possible, in order not to jeopardise the Men’s World Cup, said a press release.
Meanwhile, South Africa was also confirmed as host of the next FIH Hockey Indoor World Cup, which was postponed due to Covid-related reasons.
The event would be staged in Pretoria from Feb 5 to 11, 2023.
Also, the executive board decided that the match schedule for the FIH Hockey Pro League would be divided in just five time windows (or blocks) from the 2023-24 season onwards - and this, for the subsequent three editions at least.
Amongst others, this would help significantly for the planning of club competitions.

De Ligt should become a mainstay at FC Bayern.”  De Ligt joined Juve in 2019 following his role in helping Ajax reach an improbable Champions League semi-final.
In Turin, he has won a Serie A title, Coppa Italia and Supercoppa in his three seasons with the club, only once finishing a campaign trophyless — last term.
“I felt the genuine appreciation from the sporting management, the coach and the board right from the start, which convinced me,” De Ligt said.
“On top of that, FC Bayern is a brilliantly run club with big aims. I’m very glad that I’m now becoming part of the FC Bayern story.”  The 22-year-old already has 38 caps for the Netherlands and leaves Juventus short of options in central defence, with veteran Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini also having departed in the close season.
There have been big changes this close season at Bayern, with Polish striker Robert Lewandowski, second in their all-time scoring list, moving to Barcelona in a deal worth 45 million euros.
Senegalese forward Sadio Mane has been brought in as a replacement from Liverpool, with De Ligt the latest high-profile arrival in Bavaria.

Blatter and Platini, once the chiefs of world and European football respectively, were cleared on July 8 by the Federal Criminal Court in a trial following a mammoth investigation that began in 2015.
The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland (OAG) confirmed to AFP it had taken the first step in appealing against the verdict.
“The OAG has... filed an appeal,” it said in a brief statement.
The Federal Criminal Court, based in the southern city of Bellinzona, must now provide a written explanation of its verdict, a process that can take some time.
This will then be considered by the OAG, which will then decide whether to maintain the appeal or withdraw it.
“This is not a preliminary decision. The judgment, to be justified in writing by the court as a result of the appeal application, will form the basis for further examination by the OAG,” the office said.
Former FIFA president Blatter, 86, and Platini, 67, were cleared of the allegations that shook world football and torpedoed their time at the top.
The Federal Criminal Court rejected the prosecution’s request for a suspended prison sentence of a year and eight months.
The trial revolved around payment for Platini’s work as an adviser to Blatter between 1998 and 2002.
Platini was accused of having submitted to FIFA in 2011 an allegedly fictitious invoice for a claimed debt still outstanding for his advisory work.They signed a contract in 1999 for an annual remuneration of 300,000 Swiss francs, which was paid in full by FIFA.
But the pair were tried over a two million Swiss franc ($2.06 million) payment in 2011 to Platini, who was then in charge of European football’s governing body UEFA.
Blatter told the court the pair had actually struck a  “gentleman’s agreement” for Platini to be paid a million Swiss francs a year.
Both were accused of fraud and forgery of a document. Blatter was accused of misappropriation and criminal mismanagement, while Platini was accused of participating in those offences.
The court concluded that fraud was  “not established with a likelihood bordering on certainty”, and therefore applied the general principle of criminal law according to which  “the doubt must benefit the accused”.
Joseph  “Sepp” Blatter joined FIFA in 1975, became its general secretary in 1981 and the president of world football’s governing body in 1998.
He was forced to stand down in 2015 and was banned by FIFA for eight years, later reduced to six, over ethics breaches for authorising the payment to Platini.
Platini is regarded among world football’s greatest-ever players. He won the Ballon d’Or, considered the most prestigious individual award, three times. Platini was UEFA’s president from Jan 2007 to Dec 2015.
