0,Court orders removal of IO in Dua ‘kidnap’ case,KARACHI: A sessions court on Tuesday directed the chief of investigation wing of police to change the investigating...,"KARACHI: A sessions court on Tuesday directed the chief of investigation wing of police to change the investigating officer of the case pertaining to alleged abduction and underage marriage of Dua Zehra.
Additional District and Sessions Judge (East) Muhammad Mehboob Awan asked the Additional Inspector General-Investigation to appoint some “honest and efficient” police officer to investigate the high-profile case.
The judge passed these directives while allowing an application filed by Dua’s father, Syed Ali Mehdi Kazmi against senior police officials for not entertaining his requests to change incumbent IO, DSP Shoukat Ali Shahani.
The applicant’s counsel argued that suspect Zaheer Ahmed had allegedly kidnapped his client’s daughter from their Karachi home on April 16 and shifted her to Lahore.
He added that a medical board had declared Dua Zehra’s age to be between 15 and 16 years, close to 15.
He stated that the first IO of the case, Inspector Saad Ahmed Thaheem, being satisfied about Dua’s age to be 14 years had filed an interim charge sheet in court and inserted Section 3(i) of the Prevention of Trafficking in Person Act, 2018 and Sections 3 and 4 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013 in the case.
IO Thaheem had also shown Zaheer, Shabbir Ahmed, cleric Hafiz Ghulam Mustafa, who illegally solemnised their underage marriage, and eyewitness Asghar Ali as absconders and prudently decided not to record statement of the teenage Dua on face value.
The counsel said that the first IO after sincere efforts arrested the Nikah Khawan (marriage registrar) and witness Ali, adding that he had also applied to a judicial magistrate for ordering an ossification test of Dua to determine her actual age, but the court declined the request.
Advocate Nasir alleged that the incumbent IO Shahani deliberately failed to appear before the Karachi’s relevant judicial magistrate on June 9 to seek remand of 10 detained relatives of the purported groom. Subsequently, leaving the court with no option but to discharge these suspects from the case under Section 63 of the criminal procedure code against personal bonds, he added.
The counsel pointed out that despite prime suspect Zaheer had provided his cell number to IO Shahani, he deliberately failed to obtain the call data record (CDR) to confirm his whereabouts during the period of Dua’s alleged kidnapping.

1,Efforts on to recover infant who drowned in Shadman Nullah,"Man who lost wife, son says all he wants is for authorities to take action and fix drain so no one else meets the same fate.","KARACHI: The family of the woman and her infant son, who drowned in the Shadman nullah two days ago, staged a protest at the site of the tragic incident early on Tuesday morning calling for the recovery of the missing child.  
Danish, 25, lost his wife and a son when his motorcycle fell into the open, unfenced drain. The  young mother and her two-month-old son drowned but the husband was rescued by the people around. Two days have passed but the body of the missing infant could not be recovered.  
The grief-stricken man said all he wanted was that authorities take action and fix the drain so that no one else meet the same fate again.  
Irshad, a brother of Danish, told Dawn that no government official contacted them even after two days of the incident.  
He said the family only wanted that the body of their lost son was recovered and they did not want to file any complaint against any authority.  
“All we want is that what happened with us should not happen with anybody again,” he said.  
Volunteers of rescue services said that their operation was still under way, and they were looking at all the possible places where the body could be found.  
They said that they would pursue the operation for at least two more days. The volunteers of Chippa and Edhi are carrying out the search operations, but no government machinery has, so far, played any role in the search of the missing child.

2,Enhanced surveillance needed to check alarming rise in HIV cases,"There are around 200,000 HIV positive people in country","KARACHI: Health experts on Tuesday called for making HIV testing a routine test to destigmatise the infection, universal screening of all high-risk groups, including prisoners, and zero tolerance for discrimination based on HIV status, resulting in employment termination in the country.
At a seminar on ‘Reducing HIV Stigma’, it was highlighted that the HIV situation in Pakistan was alarming and needed enhanced surveillance, control, and destigmatisation.
The event was organised by the Medical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases Society of Pakistan (MMIDSP) in collaboration with the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America (APPNA), Common Management Unit, National Institute of Health and the federal and provincial governments.
The need for active government support along with donor funding to curb the HIV epidemic in the country was stressed along with mandating HIV education in all medical colleges and universities. Destigmatisation trainings for general practitioners and family medicine physicians to treat HIV patients were also urged.

There are around 200,000 HIV positive people in country

“The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor has rapidly changed the [societal] dynamics, with the result that the country’s HIV risk has gone up while the infection remains grossly underestimated,” said Dr Malik Muhammad Umair, the CEO and founder of the Pak Public Health Forum.
In his presentation on “HIV/Aids stigma among health care providers (HCPs)”, Dr Umair highlighted that 65 per cent of HIV patients did not return for treatment due to the behaviour of HCPs, including doctors and nurses.
“Pakistan is at the top for hepatitis C, while hepatitis B cases are also rising as the mode of transmission is the same as HIV,” he said.
Dr Umair said that attitudes and actions, along with fear and lack of knowledge, were leading to stigmatisation.
There are an estimated 27,000 new infections while 200,000 HIV positive people are in the country. While the national and provincial AIDS control programmes are largely focused on key populations or high-risk groups, interestingly, 65pc of registered patients are from the general public.
Despite being the most vulnerable population, the adolescent population has been ignored and overlooked in awareness campaigns, Dr Shobha Luxmi from the National Institute of Cardiovascular Disease said. “Hamien bacho sey baat karna nahi aati (we don’t know how to talk to our children),” she said.
She stressed that there was a dire need to increase awareness in schools with regards to drug abuse and sexually transmitted infections.
MMIDSP president Prof Dr Bushra Jamil said that the HIV programme in the country was floundering due to inequitable distributions of funds between the centre and the provinces.
“The current existing infrastructure and available framework is failing to reduce the number of new HIV infections, increase treatment uptake, and reduce HIV transmission and HIV associated morbidity and mortality in Pakistan,” she said.
It is worth noting that treatment for TB, HIV and malaria in Pakistan is largely donor funded, with negligible contribution from the government. HIV-related deaths in Pakistan increased by 4.5 times between 2010 and 2018, in contrast to a global decline.
Dr Jamil said that ethical and social aspects are neglected; a large majority of our educated population and HCPs had never been introduced to the concepts of patient privacy, autonomy and other basic rights.
“Stigmatisation is a reflection of prevailing illiteracy and rudimentary emotional intelligence. HCPs may not even realise that patients are humans,” she said.
The statistics pertaining to HIV prevalence in Pakistan are deeply alarming. It is rather unfortunate that though testing is the vital first step in providing the initial diagnosis for people to learn their status and assess treatment options for HIV, stigma and alienation are barriers that prevent early testing and diagnosis of the disease, said Abdul Qayyum, Roche Diagnostics Country Manager, Pakistan & Afghanistan.

3,Murad orders urgent repair of city roads to launch four routes of Peoples Bus Service,CM directs local government secretary ot personally visit the four routes.,"KARACHI: While all is set to start 30-kilometer Route-9 from Gulshan-i-Hadeed to Malir Cantt and Route-6 from Orangi Town to Singer Chowrangi from Wednesday (today), the launch of at least four other routes of the Sindh Peoples Bus Service in Karachi might be delayed for some time as different portions of roads destroyed during recent rains need repair and reconstruction, it emerged on Tuesday.
Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah was told that the portions of the road from Ajmer Nagri to Shahrah-i-Noor Jahan needed to be renovated.
The chief minister issued directives for the repair of the road on an urgent basis so that the route would be functionalised on July 22.
Similarly, the meeting was informed that Route 4 (North Karachi to West Wharf), Route-5 from Surjani Town to Masroor Base, Route 7 from Baldia Town to Mosamiyat and Route 11 from Mosamiyat to Dolmen Mall needed reconstruction of different portions of road to make the bus service operational.
The CM directed Local Government Secretary Najam Shah to personally visit these four routes and suggest repair of the roads where needed so that they could be made operational at the earliest.
Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon informed the meeting that out of 11 routes of the bus service two had been operational and six more, including of Larkana, were being made operational within next two days, while the infrastructure of four remaining routes was being improved to start the bus service.
Reviewing the operation and issues of different routes of the bus service, the CM directed the minister to start Route-9 from Gulshan-i-Hadeed to Malir Cantt from Wednesday (today). 
“The buses are available, and the route is clear, therefore, the service must be started in the public interest,” he said.
The transport minister said that the Route-1, from Malir to Tower, was operational and had attracted a large number of commuters.
He said that the road at Mehran Depot was in shambles and needed to be reconstructed so that the bus could reach Khokhrapar easily. The chief minister directed the local government minister to get the road reconstructed.
The CM was told that the Route-2 (North Karachi to Korangi Crossing) was operational but at two different locations patchwork of the road was urgently required. 
The CM was told that the Route-3 (North Karachi to Nasir Jump) would be made operational on July 22.  The meeting was informed that the Route-6 (Orangi Town to Singer Chowrangi) would also be operational on July 22.

4,Sindh extends restriction on market timings for one month,The restrictions will remain in place till August 16.,"KARACHI: In line with the federal government’s plan for effective measures to reduce loadshedding by conserving energy through a national strategy, the Sindh government on Tuesday extended for one month restrictions on timing of all commercial activities across the province but this time gave exception to more businesses and other essential services.
On June 17, the Sindh government put a bar on timing of commercial activities and asked shopping malls, business centres, shops and trading houses to close their business by 9pm. Similarly, the second category included wedding halls, banquets and venues hosting marriage-related ceremonies. All such concerns were asked to close by 10:30pm. 
However, for the third category that included hotels, restaurants, coffee shops, cafes, gyms, cinemas, etc the closure time was fixed at 11:30pm.
The restrictions of timings remained the same for all three categories but in the fresh notification the Sindh home department allowed more businesses to operate with exception. 
The Sindh government notification will remain in place till August 16.

5,DREAMS BURIED UNDER DEBRIS,"THE sound of excavators removing the debris of a multi-storey building permeates Moosa Colony, where several homes...","THE sound of excavators removing the debris of a multi-storey building permeates Moosa Colony, where several homes — and indeed many lifetimes worth of memories — went down in a cloud of smoke and rubble right in front of their eyes, not more than 48 hours ago. 
Now, it is all rubble, under which lie the crushed dreams of the families that dwelled here. It was not the stones or the steel bars they saw, but the hard-earned life savings, which turned into ashes in a matter of seconds. 
More than a dozen families, who would have been sitting in their rooms under the fan to escape from the hot and humid weather in the city, were sitting under the scorching beams of sun as the machinery tried to recover the belongings of the residents. 
As I reached out to a few people in the crowd who, as they said, “were left with nothing than the clothes they were wearing”, an old woman, aged more than 60 years, held my hand and started crying. 
Farzana, who was residing on the third floor of the apartment building shared that her son-in-law bought the house paying everything he had. “Not only that, all I had was Rs2.5lac, and I gave that to my daughter so she can keep it if something happens to me. But that too has gone. I am poor. I have lost everything,” she said while tears rolled down her cheeks. 
Dozens of people, including women, were sitting on the footpath with disbelief in their eyes as what had happened with them, and among them was Salman, another resident of the building, who had shifted at the place four months ago. 
With hopelessness in his voice, he said: “I am sitting here since it happened. It’s all lost now. I paid Rs3 million for it. Now, the builder and his partner have switched off their phones. We are sitting here, what else can we do?” 
Volunteers of some welfare and political organisations, wearing neon coloured vests with their group’s name printed on it, were making sure that no one gets close to the excavator which was removing the debris so that no one could get hurt. Between them was Mukhtar Ahmed, or as everyone else was calling him, Bagga bhai. Mr Ahmed was a hero in the crisis as the people said that he was the one who avoided the loss of lives by evacuating the affected and nearby buildings. 
“It is a miracle that no one died, and it was Bagga bhai who made it happen. It would have been impossible to avoid casualties if he wasn’t there. He convinced everyone, and even now, he is looking after the operation for us and making sure that we get whatever is left under the debris,” I overheard while standing with Mr Ahmed. 
“You are from media, right? Let me tell you that it wasn’t the rain, but the irregularity of departments and the abuse of power that leads to this. The construction of the building started in November, and the walls started to crack after three-four months. I had rented a barber shop and also owned a portion on the first floor of the building. It is the builder — Yaqoob and his son Fawad — and their partner Amir Baba, who is a policeman, and also a resident in the vicinity, who are responsible for it,” Mr Ahmed said and added that “the building had been sealed twice in a month while it was under-construction, but the construction continued and there was still some finishing work left on the sixth floor of the building. Don’t you smell something fishy? You tell me how you think it happened?” 
The neighbours, whose only mistake was that they had their houses and shops next to the building that collapsed, were also under the open sky as the Sindh Building Control Authority marked them as dangerous. 
“Bhai, I have a milkshop and I live above that. You tell me, what did I do wrong? I didn’t live in the building. I had nothing to do with it. I am paying price for nothing,” said Zohaib, who had a house and shop next to the building. 
If there was something common between all of them other than the agony, misery and suffering, it was their anger and disappointment over the government who did not “offer even a glass of water”. 
“We have been here for more than a day. We have slept on the road. No government official has paid any heed. No one even offered us a glass of water. We knew the building was going to collapse, so we got the PMT [pole mounted transformer] removed by K-Electric on a war footing basis, and avoided another misery. We set up tent on our own. No one [from government] came to rescue us,” thundered Faisal, another resident of the building, who is also contesting in the July 24 local government elections for a councillor seat. 
Another neighbour yelled from a distance to make sure that I hear him loud and clear and said: “We want the builder to pay the damage. Not to me, but to everyone who has been affected. Why should we bear the loss for someone else’s incompetence and irregularity? We will protest as well,” and added with a downhearted smile: “You and I both know, nothing will happen.”

6,CPLC to carry out verification of domestic servants’ details,New police cell being established to focus on robberies,"KARACHI: The Citizens-Police Liaison Committee and Karachi police on Tuesday established a new cell to control growing incidents of robberies and dacoities in the metropolis.  
The new cell would work by initiating intelligence gathering in five to six police stations on a pilot basis where criminals and their patrons’ activities were high.  
Verification of domestic servants’ data would also be carried out and combing operations would be launched, said CPLC chief Zubair Habib.  
These decisions were taken during a visit of city police chief Javed Akhar Odho to the CPLC head office in Governor House.  

New police cell being established to focus on robberies  

The CPLC chief, Mr Habib, told Dawn that the Karachi police chief was given a briefing about crimes in the city.  
During the briefing, a proposal for the establishment of ‘Anti-Dacoity and Robbery Cell’ (ADRC) in Karachi was discussed at length.  
Initially the proposed cell would be established in the ‘most volatile’ districts of the city on a pilot basis.  
“The ADRC functioning will be based on ground intelligence, investigation and available data of criminals involved,” opined Mr Habib, adding that it would be a ‘preventive policing model’ rather than a reactive one.  
The CPLC and city police decided to set up the ADRC initially in two districts, namely South and East, at offices of the respective police DIGs under their supervision.  
He said many people were reluctant to submit papers/documents of their domestic servants and helpers to police, and therefore, the citizens would be persuaded to approach the CPLC, which has access to the data of the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), for ‘verification’ of credentials/record of their servants.  
The CPLC head said that the Karachi police chief was given a briefing for collecting “intelligence and conducting combing operation against outlaws in hideouts within the jurisdiction of police stations namely Manghopir, Moachko, SITE-Superhighway Industrial Area, Gulshan-i-Maymar and Surjani Town adjacent to Northern Bypass”.  
Meanwhile, the CPLC statement said that the city police chief visited various departments of the CPLC including sections of IT, Digital Data Analysis and the CPLC’s 24/7 Call Centre.  
He was briefed about the CPLC’s data management, its analysis and sharing with the police and other law enforcement agencies.  
He was also given a briefing about the CPLC-police joint operations and modus operandi to handle cases of heinous crimes.

Dania Shah, through her attorney, approached the SHC to become an intervener/respondent in the proceedings stating that she was the only surviving widow of late lawmaker and “her misjoinder as a necessary party to this petition by the petitioners was based on hoodwinking the court by suppressing real facts”.
She submitted that she was in iddat at her native town in Lodhran and unable to appear before the SHC at this stage.
The applicant also submitted a copy of her marriage certificate with Aamir Liaquat who had contracted the third marriage with Ms Shah around five months ago.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal allowed the application by consent and directed its office to assign it a number.
The bench observed that this matter was partly heard, but the state lawyer and counsel for respondents sought time to assist the court on legal point. Therefore, the bench adjourned the matter for July 28.
On the previous hearing, police had informed the SHC that the post-mortem examination of Aamir Liaquat had not been conducted on the request of his family and on the basis of external examination nothing can be opined regarding the cause of death.
Aamir Liaquat was found dead at his Karachi residence on June 9 under mysterious circumstances.

10,"PTI’s struggle geared towards dismantling ‘70-year-old system’, says Asad Umar",HYDERABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf secretary general Asad Umar has said that his party’s struggle is not aimed...,"HYDERABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf secretary general Asad Umar has said that his party’s struggle is not aimed merely at making Imran Khan prime minister again but it is geared towards dismantlement of the 70 year old system in which the “powerful” decide people’s destiny behind closed doors under external powers’ patronage. 
“The primary aim of the PTI is to do away with this system because it is major cause of Pakistan’s problems,” he said while addressing members of Hyderabad District Bar Association (HDBA) and party workers at separate programmes here on Tuesday. 
He said that people from every strata of society were participating in this struggle and “they want that decisions for them should be taken by their genuinely elected representatives alone”. Only people would have power to elect or reject their representatives, he said.
He said that if a group of people ruled with the help of the “powerful” or external forces they would not be taking decisions for masses and the country had been witnessing its worst example for past three months. “The present government has renamed ‘price hike’ as ‘difficult decisions’ although it is the easiest way to raise prices (to generate revenue),” he said.
He said that currency devaluation used to happen in months previously, then it began to be seen within weeks and now rupee was shedding value within hours. If prices of petrol, electricity and gas were raised, it caused hike in prices of all essential commodities and transport and eventually affected masses directly, he said.
“But the PM has recently said he is least bothered about the impacts of price hike. It is not an issue whether masses are happy or not because those who have given ‘ashirbad’ to PM are happy,” he said. 
He said that Punjab’s 80pc by-poll results went in PTI’s favour. “Can anything else reflect will of people as strongly as the by-poll result?” he observed.
He said the party’s struggle was nearing its successful end. All surveys had showed that 75pc people had rejected April 9 regime change. “We saw people switching loyalties and selling their conscience during the regime change operation in assemblies. Had it been people’s will, there would not have been any uproar but PTI can’t accept that external interference leads to regime change in a country of 220m,” he said.
Umar said that Sindh would also witness change like Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa where sun had set on politics of ANP and JUI-F while PML-N’s politics had been buried in Punjab. 
He disclosed that Imran Khan was scheduled to visit Hyderabad to lay foundation stone for Hyderabad-Sukkur motorway but for regime change. 
Earlier, retired Justice Noorul Haq Qureshi, who had joined PTI soon after no April 9, said that he had seen many political parties but decided to join PTI after finding Imran Khan to be a true leader.
Powerless LGs
Umar said later at the party workers’ convention that Sindh’s local government system was powerless as it did not transfer real authority to local government representatives. 
He said this system was designed purposely to ensure ‘one family’ perpetuated in rule and all resources remained at its disposal. The system forced people to keep looking towards them for jobs, admission to colleges or transfer etc, he said. 
He said that powers were devolved in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where basic health units were built and people were getting jobs on the basis of merit. The party was struggling to introduce a new system in which all citizens were served without discrimination of caste, creed and colour, he said.
He said that Hyderabad had paid a heavy price in the past when families received bodies of their loved ones but they did not get potable drinking water to date. 
He said that Imran Khan said “absolutely not” to the powerful country when it demanded airbases and no leader had previously had the courage to say no. “A ‘mazloom’ is sitting on a chair but he does not know why this has happened to him. Let me tell you prime minister that your agony is going to end soon as your government will be sent packing,” he said. 
Now, he said, people would see ‘balla’ ruling right from Hyderabad to Ghotki and Larkana in general election, and urged people to come out in large numbers on July 24 for real “freedom”.

The senator said in a press statement issued here on Tuesday that his party was not afraid of the threats hurled by Imran Khan. The parliament and coalition government would complete their tenure and general election would be held on time, he said. 
However, he said, if the coalition partners decided to go for general election, PPP was ready to go to people but “we will not succumb to anyone’s blackmailing”.
He said that if Imran Khan wished to have premature polls, then he had better dissolve Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assembly first because it would be illogical to dissolve the National Assembly alone. 
He asked how the fate of 857 seats could be decided merely on the basis of victory over 15 seats in a by-election. 
He alleged the former prime minister was deliberately targeting Election Commission of Pakistan to stop it from announcing its pending decision on foreign funding case against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. 
Khuhro claimed that Imran Khan had demanded resignation of the chief election commissioner, who had successfully held transparent election without the use of electronic voting machines.

12,Concern raised over dramatic increase in incidents of blind dolphins being stranded,Wildlife officials rescue seven dolphins in Rohri Canal,"KARACHI: Stranding of the endangered blind dolphins have increased dramatically over the past one year in the upstream Sukkur barrage area, apparently due to growing movement of motorised boats. On Tuesday, the wildlife department rescued a group of seven dolphins in the Rohri canal.
Sources said there had been a striking ‘unexplained increase” in dolphin stranding in the irrigation canals in Sukkur in one and a half years, which seemed to be linked to the growing motorised movement in their habitat.
“People are cutting wood from the forests left in the area and using boats to shift the logs to other places to sell them off,” shared a wildlife department official on the condition of anonymity.
The species, he said, could experience stress during the rescue and translocation process due to the sound and movement of the vehicle.

Wildlife officials rescue seven dolphins in Rohri Canal

The Indus dolphin, he explained, was a sensitive mammal, which relied on its highly developed sonar and hearing to navigate and the motorised movement in the channels might have disoriented the species.
The forest areas, he pointed out, were practically “no-go areas” as they were ruled by dacoits with no government writ, he added.
38 stranding cases this year
The wildlife department data of dolphin rescue operation show that a total of 46 incidents of stranding were reported from 2015 to 2020. Of them, 44 dolphins were rescued. 
In 2004, 26 incidents of stranding were reported in which 17 dolphins were rescued. In 2005, 17 incidents were reported with 15 rescue cases. In 2010, 22 dolphins were rescued out of the 17 stranded members.
“In 2021, the department was able to save 10 out of the 16 stranded dolphins while this year so far 38 incidents have been reported. We are able to rescue 34 stranded dolphins,” said a wildlife official.
Need for scientific inquiry
When contacted, Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar admitted that there was an increase in stranding incidents but contended that this required a thorough scientific investigation. 
“We can’t say anything for sure right now as there could be multiple reasons (behind the increase in stranding incidents). However, we know that it’s a sound-sensitive species,” he said.
About the mortalities during rescue operation, he said it’s a highly skilled operation, involving great experience and care. “When the canal gates are closed, the water level drops, and these canals turn into small ponds and dolphins get trapped. There is 100 per cent risk in the rescue operation during which trapped dolphins are safely translocated to the main river channel.”
Efforts are on for the population’s conservation with the help of non-government organisations, communities and the government. 
“Therefore, a specialised soundproof ambulance is eq­ui­­pped with a shower and water tank to keep the dolphin’s skin moist to ensure its well-being and safety,” he said.
According to media rep­orts, this year has been a difficult for the dolphins, also for the sub-population found in Taunsa-Guddu section of the river due to increasing mortality.
Most incidents are linked to fishing activity being carried out under a contract system authorised by the fisheries department. The fishing has proved lethal for the dwindling population of this precious species.
Experts believe protection of such rare mammals is all the more important in a country like Pakistan as this is considered flagship species of Indus River and indicator of health of the Indus River Ecosystem and its associated habitat. 
Development of barrages and habitat fragmentation and destruction were cited as the major reasons for their dwindling population. 
The Indus river dolphin is the second most endangered freshwater dolphin in the world. They have adapted to life in the muddy river and are functionally blind. 
In 2001, World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan conduc­ted the first Indus River dolphin survey where only 1,200 individuals were counted.
