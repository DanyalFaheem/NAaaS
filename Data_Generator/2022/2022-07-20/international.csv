0,Award-winning film director Panahi to serve 6-year jail term,"TEHRAN: Award-winning dissident Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi, arrested last week in Tehran, must serve a six-year...","TEHRAN: Award-winning dissident Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi, arrested last week in Tehran, must serve a six-year sentence previously handed to him in 2010, the judicial authority announced on Tuesday.
Panahi, 62, has won a number of awards at international festivals for films that have critiqued modern Iran, including the top prize in Berlin for  “Taxi” in 2015, and best screenplay at Cannes for his film  “Three Faces” in 2018.
He is the third director to be detained this month, alongside Mostafa Aleahmad and Mohammad Rasoulof, who won the Golden Bear in Berlin in 2020 with his film  “There Is No Evil”.
“Panahi had been sentenced in 2010 to a total of six years in prison” and was taken  “to Evin detention centre to serve his sentence there”, judiciary spokesman Massoud Setayeshi told reporters.
He was arrested in 2010, following his support for anti-government demonstrations.
He was convicted of  “propaganda against the system”, sentenced to six years in jail, banned from directing or writing films and blocked from leaving the country.
But he served only two months behind bars in 2010, and was subsequently living on conditional release, which could be revoked at any time.
Panahi was arrested again on July 11 after he went to the prosecutor’s office to follow up on the situation of Rasoulof.
The arrests come after Panahi and Rasoulof decried in May the arrests of several colleagues in their homeland in an open letter.
Despite the political pressures, Iran has a thriving film industry and productions by its nationals regularly win awards at major international festivals. Panahi’s detention has sparked condemnation from fellow filmmakers.
Cannes film festival organisers said they  “strongly condemn” the arrests as well as  “the wave of repression evidently under way in Iran against its artists”.
The Venice film festival called for the  “immediate release” of the directors, while the Berlin film festival said it was  “dismayed and outraged”.
France on Tuesday again called for Panahi’s  “immediate” release, decrying his  “arbitrary arrest”, a foreign ministry spokesperson said.
Last week the ministry had cited a  “worrying deterioration in the situation of artists in Iran”. Iran has in recent weeks arrested several leading figures, including reformist politician Mostafa Tajzadeh, who was detained on July 8.
Tajzadeh  “is currently in pre-trial detention in Evin” prison, accused of  “gathering and collusion with the intention of acting against the country’s security, and propaganda against the system”, Setayeshi said on Tuesday.
The politician, who last year made an unsuccessful bid for the presidency, was arrested in 2009 during protests disputing the re-election of former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.
Tajzadeh, who had long campaigned for democratic and  “structural changes” in the Islamic republic, was convicted in 2010 on charges of harming national security and propaganda against the state before being released in 2016 after serving his sentence.
He was deputy interior minister during the 1997-2005 tenure of reformist president Mohammad Khatami.

1,US notes Pakistan’s progress in curbing human trafficking,Report says government demonstrated overall increasing efforts on its anti-trafficking capacity; upgrades country to Tier 2.,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Tuesday upgraded Pakistan from the Tier 2 watch list to Tier 2 on its trafficking in persons list, citing overall progress in eliminating trafficking.
“The government demonstrated overall increasing efforts compared with the previous reporting period, considering the imp­act of the Covid-19 pandemic, if any, on its anti-trafficking capacity; therefore, Pakis­tan was upgraded to Tier 2,” said the report.
Tier 2 includes countries whose governments do not fully comply with all requirements for discouraging human trafficking but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards.
In contrast, the Tier 2 watch list includes countries who could be placed in Tier 3 and be penalised with sanctions and limited access to the US and international foreign assistance because of their non-compliance. 
Pakistan remained on the watch list in 2015 to 2017 before being upgraded to Tier 2 in 2018 and remained there the next year. However, the country was again downgraded to Tier 2 watch list in 2020 and remained on the list in 2021. 
Secretary of State Antony Blinken released the report at the State Department and also announced the names of individuals from around the world whose tireless efforts have made a lasting impact on the fight against human trafficking.
The report commended Pakistan for inc­reasing investigations, prosecutions and convictions, including increasing investigations and prosecutions under the 2018 Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act (PTPA).
The report also noted that the government of Pakistan “does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking,” although it “is making significant efforts to do so”.  According to the report, during 2021, the government referred more victims for protection services. The government’s provincial departments increased implementation of standard operating procedures (SOPs) on victim identification and referral and trained more stakeholders. 
The government allocated resources for implementing the National Action Plan (NAP) and amended the PTPA to remove provisions that allowed fines in lieu of imprisonment for sex trafficking crimes with women and children as victims.
For a third year, the government did not take adequate action against credible reports of official complicity in trafficking. There were reports of victims being re-victimised soon after rescue, and corruption continued to hinder anti-trafficking efforts. 
In Sindh, local officials continued to perpetrate bonded labour with impunity in brick kilns and on farms.
The report urged Pakistan to increase prosecutions and convictions of all forms of trafficking, including bonded labour at both the federal and provincial levels.
It also urged Pakistan to vigorously increase the number of bonded labour victims identified and referred to services through training of provincial police, labour inspectors and social services on SOPs.
The report strongly suggested preventing support to non-state armed groups that unlawfully recruit or use child soldiers.

3,US judge mulls delay of former Trump aide Bannon’s trial,The court had been expe­cted to finalise selecting 12 jurors and two alternates from a pool of 22 people.,"WASHINGTON: A federal judge said on Tuesday he will consider delaying the criminal trial of Steve Bannon, a prominent former presidential adviser to Donald Trump, due to a dispute over the scope of the defence to be presented for why Bannon defied a subpoena from lawmakers investigating last year’s attack on the US Capitol.
Bannon, 68, is facing two misdemeanor counts of obstruction of Congress after he declined last year to provide testimony or documents to the Democratic-led House of Representatives select committee.
The court had been expe­cted to finalise selecting 12 jurors and two alternates from a pool of 22 people on Tuesday, with opening statements from the prosecution and defense following. That process was delayed as US District Judge Carl Nichols dealt with a dispute between the two sides over what evidence can be presented by the defense in the case.
The judge denied a motion by Bannon’s lawyers to delay the start of the trial by a month, but said he would entertain the possibility of a shorter delay — perhaps a couple of days — and ordered the parties to hash out the issues over a lunch break.
Nichols had previously ruled that Bannon could not claim he failed to comply with the subpoena because he believed his documents and testimony were protected by a legal doctrine called executive privilege that can keep certain presidential communications confidential.
The judge also previously barred Bannon from telling jurors that he relied upon advice from his lawyer, who told him there were valid legal reasons he could fail to respond to the subpoena.
Nichols left open the door last week for Bannon to offer a defense that he believed the subpoena deadlines were flexible and subject to negotiation. Bannon reversed course this month and said he wanted to testify before a public committee hearing, nearly 10 months after defying the subpoena.
There has been no indication of any plan to have him do so, as the committee likely would want him to first testify in closed sessions in order to cover a wide range of matters. Trump told Bannon he was waiving any executive privilege claim.

4,Johnson receives Churchill tomes as parting gift,"LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held his last scheduled cabinet meeting on Tuesday, receiving first...","LONDON: British Prime Minister Boris Johnson held his last scheduled cabinet meeting on Tuesday, receiving first editions of books by wartime leader Winston Churchill on World War Two as a parting gift.
The meeting was held on the hottest day in British history, after Johnson was criticised by the opposition for failing to attend emergency meetings set up to discuss the heatwave response.
Johnson is remaining in office until his successor is named, after saying he would step down having lost support of his party’s members of parliament. His downfall followed a series of scandals over lockdown parties at Downing Street and the handling of allegations against lawmakers.
It marks a remarkable collapse for a prime minister who in 2019 won the biggest Conservative vote share since 1979.
Johnson’s spokesman said the prime minister used his final cabinet meeting to emphasise his success in lifting Covid lockdowns. Asked if Johnson had reflected on the mistakes that had brought him down, the spokesman said:  “I don’t have any more to add on that”.
“At the conclusion of cabinet, the prime minister was presented with gifts to thank him for his service to the country, including first editions of Winston Churchill’s books on the Second World War,” the spokesman told reporters.
Churchill is a hero of Johnson’s, and the prime minister has written a biography of him. Johnson’s successor is set to be announced on Sept 5, and there are no cabinet meetings scheduled until then, while parliament is in summer recess.

5,China warns of ‘forceful measures’ if US house speaker visits Taiwan,US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment; Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry says it has no information.,"BEIJING: China’s government on Tuesday warned that it would take  “forceful measures” if US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan, after the Financial Times said she would go to the Chinese-claimed island next month.
Pelosi and her delegation will also visit Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore, and spend time in Hawaii at the headquarters of US Indo-Pacific command, the London paper added, citing people familiar with the matter.
The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry said it has  “not received relevant information” about any visit.
Asked about the report, Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, said,  “We do not confirm or deny international travel in advance due to longstanding security protocols.” 
The Democratic leader’s visit to Taiwan had been postponed from April, after she tested positive for Covid-19. At the time, China said such a visit would severely affect Chinese-US relations.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said any visit by Pelosi would  “seriously undermine China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.
“If the US side obstinately clings to this course, China will definitely take resolute and forceful measures to firmly defend its national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said. “The United States must be fully responsible for all the consequences caused by this.” 
Taiwan faces mounting pressure from China, which considers the democratically governed island its own territory. The issue is a constant irritant in ties between Beijing and Washington. Taiwan, however, has been heartened by continued support offered by US President Joe Biden’s administration, which has repeatedly spoken of its  “rock-solid” commitment to the island.
Pelosi, a long-time critic of China, held an online meeting with Taiwanese Vice President William Lai in January as he wrapped up a visit to the United States and Honduras. The White House had expressed concern about the Pelosi trip, the Financial Times said, citing three people familiar with the situation.
There were divisions in the Democratic US administration over whether Pelosi should visit Taiwan, the FT quoted two sources as saying.
Some officials believed it had been easier to justify a visit in April, as that was just after the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it added.

6,"October trial set in Musk, Twitter buyout battle","The judge did not set an exact date, leaving it to the parties to converge on the timing.","WASHINGTON: Twitter and Elon Musk were ordered on Tuesday to trial in October over whether the Tesla chief can be forced to complete his $44 billion deal to buy the social network, an early win for the uncertainty-wracked platform.
A judge in the eastern US state of Delaware ruled against Musk’s push for a February date, while hewing closely to Twitter’s desire for an expedited schedule.
Billions of dollars are at stake, but so is the future of the platform that Musk has said should allow any legal speech, an absolutist position that has sparked fears the network could be used to incite violence.
“We urge the court to enter a prompt schedule and give multiple grounds for that,” Twitter lawyer William Savitt argued, noting  “the continued uncertainty caused by Musk’s purported termination inflicts harm on Twitter every day, every hour of every day.” 
Musk’s team had argued fiercely against an expedited trial date, saying Twitter’s preferred date in September was simple too fast for such a complex matter. The judge did not set an exact date, leaving it to the parties to converge on the timing.
Twitter lawyers noted the deal is supposed to close toward the end of October, just six months after Musk launched an unsolicited bid that the company’s board first resisted but then supported.

7,‘Shocking’ report lists devastation to wildlife in Australia,"SYDNEY: Australia’s unique wildlife is being devastated by bushfires, drought, habitat loss and global warming, a...","SYDNEY: Australia’s unique wildlife is being devastated by bushfires, drought, habitat loss and global warming, a government report said on Tuesday, warning that more species were headed for extinction.
The five-yearly State of the Environment report prompted calls for dramatic action to reverse the  “poor and deteriorating” state of flora and fauna depicted by scientists on land and at sea.
The damage is being hastened by a climate that has warmed Australia’s average land temperature by 1.4 degrees Celsius since the early 20th century, the report said.
“Our inability to adequately manage pressures will continue to result in species extinctions,” scientists warned in the report. Australia’s environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, said it was a  “shocking document”. “It tells a story of crisis and decline in Australia’s environment,” she said.
Plibersek, a member of the centre-left Labor Party that came to power in May elections, said her predecessor under the previous conservative government received the report in December 2021 but never released it. “I won’t be putting my head in the sand,” she said.
Australia’s 2019-2020  “Black Summer” bushfires burned more than eight million hectares of native vegetation and killed or displaced 1-3 billion animals, the report found.
Marine heatwaves caused mass coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 2016, 2017 and 2020, it said. Since then, a government report in March found the reef had again suffered mass bleaching.
‘Iconic species’ to disappear
Millions of hectares of primary forest had been cleared since 1990, the report said.
More than seven million hectares of habitat for threatened species were cleared between 2000 and 2017 without being assessed under Australia’s environmental conservation laws, it found.
In five years, more than 200 plant and animal species of national significance had been added to the list of threatened species under Australia’s environmental laws.
“Australia has lost more mammal species than any other continent,” the report said, with the number of new species listed as being under greater threat up by eight percent in five years. Australia’s cities are also growing at a rapid clip, scientists found, raising urban heat, pollution and waste while stretching water and energy resources.
“Sydney has lost more than 70 percent of native vegetation cover through development,” the report said.
Sydney Habour’s stormwater drains also created hotspots of pollution with concentrations 20 times higher than when the harbour was pristine.
“The findings of this report are heartbreaking, and the leadership failures that have led to loss at this scale devastating,” said WWF-Australia acting chief executive Rachel Lowry.
“If we ignore the warnings of this report then iconic species like koalas across eastern Australia, or our largest gliding mammal, the greater glider, will disappear forever on our watch.” 
‘We need to do more’
WWF-Australia said the report should be a  “turning point” that led to greater investment and stronger laws to protect Australia’s wildlife and wilderness. Lowry urged the new government to act quickly, condemning existing environmental legislation for  “failing miserably” to protect threatened species.
“When we allow losses at this scale, we don’t just lose a piece of Australia’s identity, we lose the opportunity to ensure a healthy, thriving economy alongside some of the world’s most precious natural assets,” she said.
The  “devastating” new report showed coasts and marine environments were deteriorating, the Australian Marine Conservation Society said.
“The wellbeing of Australians is wrapped up with the health of our oceans, and the marine wildlife found there, but sadly our oceans are suffering from overheating, overuse and under-protection,” said the society’s chief executive, Darren Kindleysides.
“We need to do more now, or we put at risk everything we rely on our oceans for — our health, wellbeing, livelihoods and our culture.”

8,Brad Pitt battles assassins in action thriller ‘Bullet Train’,BERLIN: Hollywood star Brad Pitt fights off assassins on a high speed train travelling across Japan in action...,"BERLIN: Hollywood star Brad Pitt fights off assassins on a high speed train travelling across Japan in action thriller  “Bullet Train”, reuniting with his former stuntman turned director David Leitch.
Pitt plays Ladybug, an unlucky assassin who wants to get a job done well before he finds himself battling a range of dangerous opponents, all with missions connected to his, on board the bullet train.
Based on Kotaro Isaka’s 2010 novel, the film also stars Sandra Bullock, Zazie Beetz, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Joey King, Brian Tyree Henry, Michael Shannon and Hiroyuki Sanada. “Dave actually was my stunt man in ‘98...We met on ‘Fight Club’ and he trained me for the fight and it worked so well,” Pitt told a news conference in Berlin on Tuesday, about Leitch.
“We went on with that pairing till about ‘04 with a bunch of other films, and then he left me to do other things, and now it’s come back full circle so it’s really nice for me to have him as the boss now.”  The film features plenty of stunts and fight scenes as the assassins all seek to get hold of a briefcase.
Leitch, who directed  “Atomic Blonde”,  “Deadpool 2” and  “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw”, said he sought to balance the film’s violence with comedy.
“It’s always a balance of tone in a movie...I think creating a heightened world... allows us to get away with more things,” he said.  “So we’re in this sort of comic book world, this escapist fantasy world and we can play with some of those darker ideas.”  The film’s cast and crew are promoting  “Bullet Train” in Europe this week ahead of its global release in early August.
“I didn’t even realise it’s been like three years because we’ve been in lockdown and haven’t brought anything to a table in a while,” Pitt said of returning to the promotional trail.
“It’s just nice. We all put everything we had into telling the story. It’s come together...and it’s really nice to now let it go, hopefully people will be enjoying it together in the theatre, laughing.”
