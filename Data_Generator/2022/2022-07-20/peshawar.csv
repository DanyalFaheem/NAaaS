3,PHC sets two-month deadline for removal of swings from Peshawar Zoo,Court observes that installation of swings increases animals' misery by creating noise and disturbance.,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has set a two months deadline for the removal of amusement rides from the Peshawar Zoo by the contractor.
A bench consisting of Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan and Justice Shahid Khan pronounced that its order issued last year for the removal of swings and other rides from the zoo should be fully implemented.
It observed that animals in the zoo were confined to cages and the installation of swings increased their misery by causing noise and disturbance.
The bench was hearing the petition of a private company, Sun Rise, which sought more time for the removal of swings, train and amusement rides from the zoo.
The petitioner’s counsel, Taimur Ali Shah, said that his client had spent Rs4 million to install amusement rides, which remained a focus of the attraction of visitors, especially children.
He said that the administration had given his client a month time, which was too little to remove those items.
Additional advocate general Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah said that the administration had ordered the removal of swings and other mechanical devices from the premises of the zoo on the order of the high court as those items had become a source of nuisance for animals kept there.
Deputy director of the zoo Haseena Ambreen told the bench that it had ordered in March 2021 to remove amusement swings from the zoo for which a month time was given to the petitioner and contractor.
She, however, said that the petitioner had not implemented those orders and the dismantling of those amusement items had been taking place at a snail’s pace.
The official said that the contractor was removing those items in intervals as he started the work but suspended it before resuming it. The bench observed that it had to take a decision keeping in view the interest of zoo animals.
It decided that it would give a two months time to the contractor to remove amusement rides from the premises of the zoo.

4,Killing of ‘proxy’ in checkpost attack embarrasses Khyber police,DPO says he is investigating the matter to take action as per rules.,"KHYBER: The killing of a civilian in police uniform during an armed attack on a checkpost in Bara on July 16 caused embarrassment to the force as the deceased was performing duty as a substitute for an unknown regular policeman.
Police in Bara initially said that two of their colleagues were killed in the attack but the statement was immediately corrected by the spokesman at the Shah Kas Police Training Centre in Jamrud.
The official statement said that a policeman Said Karim and a civilian Abdur Rahim were killed in the attack in Arjali Nadi and arrangements were being made for the official funeral of the deceased policeman at the Shah Kas centre. The body of the ‘proxy’ policeman was handed over to his family despite that the fact that he was killed in uniform inside the checkpost.
Referred to as ‘Eywazi’ or ‘proxy’ by local police and even ordinary tribesmen in Khyber and other tribal districts, the number of such persons, deputising for regular police in different localities, is not known nor the police officials bother to keep any record of such persons.

DPO says he is investigating the matter to take action as per rules

Downplaying the presence of Abdur Rahim at the checkpost during the attack, Bara SHO Sawalzer Khan told Dawn that in fact he was a cook and was ‘mistakenly’ present there.
DPO Mohammad Imran, when contacted, said that he had given clear instructions to all the SHOs that the practice of hiring ‘proxies’ should be discouraged and no such person should be allowed to perform any official or security duty as it was against rules and regulations.
He said that he had clearly instructed personnel of police force to apply for leave for any legitimate reason and the leave would be granted but such policemen were not allowed to acquire the services of a proxy to substitute for him at any place.
He said that he was investigating the presence and killing of a ‘proxy’ in Bara and action would be taken as per rules against those, who were responsible for it.
The practice of hiring services of ‘proxy’ has been in vogue in tribal areas for the last few decades. A number of the former khasadars, who had either gone to foreign countries in search job or had taken up part-time jobs in other cities of Pakistan along with running parallel businesses, used to hire a local person to perform duty in his place during his absence.
Some of the ‘proxies’ were also killed in attacks by terrorists in different parts of tribal areas. However, their services were not acknowledged. None of them were given any special monetary package as well despite repeated requests from their family members.
The local elders too have ‘a behind the scene’ role in continuation of the said practice as they pressurise the police officials for temporarily relieving their kith and kin from official duties while providing a substitute in his place.
Sources in Torkham told Dawn that a considerable number of such ‘proxy’ policemen had been performing duty on some lucrative positions near the border since long while the original policemen occupied other posts for personal gains.
They said that the ‘proxy’ mafia was so strong that so far every effort to dislodge them from their current positions had met failure.

The two-day event has been organised by Pakistan Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgeons (PSM&BS) at Khyber Teaching Hospital where senior surgeons performed live surgeries to impart new techniques to the doctors from the public and private sector hospitals of the province.

The secretary of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter of the society, Dr Mohammad Zarin, said that obesity was spreading like pandemic and Pakistan was ranked 8th worldwide which could be overcome through surgeries.
“People in their young age are dying of obesity which is alarming. For the past 25 years, bariatric surgery has been practiced globally, which has led to putting brakes on many illnesses,” he said.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, bariatric surgeries are conducted in Khyber Teaching Hospital, Hayatabad Medical Complex and Lady Reading Hospital in Peshawar and teaching hospitals in Abbottabad and Swat.

The chairperson of surgery department, Prof Mah Munir Khan and former dean of KMC Prof Rohul Muqim also spoke on the occasion. They said that bariatric was not a cosmetic surgery but it was performed to reduce weight and cure other related problems.
