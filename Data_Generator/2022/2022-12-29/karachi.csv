2,SC asks Sindh govt to complete recruitment process of differently-abled within four months,Petitioners move court for implementation of 5pc govt job quota.,"KARACHI: The Supreme Court has directed the Sindh government to start the process to appoint differently-abled persons in its different departments in accordance with law and complete the exercise within four months.
A two-judge bench headed by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail asked the provincial government to initiate the procedure of recruitment within two weeks.
Several differently-abled persons have approached the apex court against the Aug 19 judgement of the Sindh High Court through which the court dismissed their petitions seeking employment as per the job quota reserved for differently-abled persons.
The counsel for petitioners submitted before the Supreme Court that the Sindh government was not filling the vacant posts reserved for differently-abled persons as per its policy.

Petitioners move court for implementation of 5pc govt job quota

The lawyer sought a directive for the provincial government to start the process for appointment in all the departments, autonomous, and semi-autonomous bodies under its administrative control.
The additional advocate general stated that the process in this regard had already been started. 
He assured the apex court that all the sectioned posts lying vacant in every department and meant for differently-abled persons will be advertised in accordance with the policy and eligible and suitable candidates will be selected after due process and in accordance with applicable rules.
“In view of above, the government of Sindh, keeping in view the demand and availability of vacancies, should start the process for the appointment of the differently abled persons in accordance with law, rules and policy, within a period of two weeks, after receiving a copy of this order. The government should make sure that the process so initiated in each department is completed, preferably, within a period of four months,” the bench stated in its order.
It may be recalled that five per cent job quota had been allocated for differently-abled persons under the Sindh Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2018.
In May last, the SHC had also directed the provincial authorities to consider the pending applications of differently-abled persons and if qualified, their cases may be considered for appointment in respective departments in view of the five per cent quota and to complete the exercise preferably within a period of three months.
While disposing of a set of petitions filed by physically challenged persons seeking implementation of government job quota allocated for them, the SHC had ruled that the cases of differently-abled persons, which had not been rejected so far, would be considered by the competent authority strictly in accordance with law.
Moreover, the SHC had also passed a number of orders in the past on several petitions and had directed the chief secretary to oversee the entire process of recruitment of differently-abled persons in different departments of the provincial government.

4,"Only clean drinking water needed to lighten disease burden of country, moot told","Major part of health budget is spent on urban areas, says expert...","KARACHI: Continued bad governance in Pakistan, especially in Sindh, is a man-made disaster that people experience every day. Their present is appalling and the future bleak. Years of neglect has made health and environmental challenges so grave today that people are forced to pay a heavy price for just being alive; the air they breathe is toxic and the water available for drinking highly contaminated. 
This was the gist of experts’ views shared during a health conference held on Wednesday at a local hotel. 
The event titled “Decent Work — Better Healthcare Services” was jointly organised by the All Sindh Lady Health Workers and Employees Union, Public Services International and Workers’ Education and Research Organisation (WERO). 
Giving a presentation on health challenges, Dr Asim Bashir Khan, an expert on development economy and public finance, said the burden of non-development expenditure that had grown dramatically over the years and the small amount reserved for development was a major reason behind people’s sufferings. 

Major part of health budget is spent on urban areas, says expert

“Whether it’s the health, irrigation or social welfare department, the problem affects all sectors. The little the provincial government allocates for health comes from foreign donor-funded programmes,” he said, while presenting data on the subject and highlighting flaws in the ongoing health programmes. 
High population growth both in the urban and rural areas, ill-planned programmes and misplaced priorities, he pointed out, had compounded matters. 
In his remarks, senior health professional Dr Tipu Sultan said there was no dearth of funds in the health sector. 
“Irregularities and mismanagement are rampant in the health system that explains poor man’s sufferings,” he said. 
According to Dr Sultan, a major chunk of the health budget is spent in the urban areas and that too on purchasing expensive equipment at tertiary care hospitals. 
“While rural areas, home to over 60 per cent population, don’t even get proper primary health care facilities.” 
On the problems being faced by lady health workers, Dr Sultan said the health sector was in the hands of corrupt people. 
“Lady health workers and other paramedical staff are the backbone of a health system. But, the irony is that their service structure is not defined yet.” 
“Importing cancer’
Dr Qaiser Sajjad, representing the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), highlighted the multiple health challenges the country faced in general and the province of Sindh in particular. 
He regretted that preventive and effective primary healthcare had never been on the priority of any government. 
“If the government provides only clean water to people, the disease burden will be reduced to half. Here, we have developed an atomic bomb, but the country is unable to eliminate mosquitoes that kill so many people every year.” 
Dr Sajjad, also a senior ENT surgeon, strongly suggested a ban on the import of betel nuts, one of the key sources of oral cancer in the country. 
“Chhalia [betel nuts] is grown nowhere in Pakistan. But, we are so rich that we import this carcinogenic substance from our own pocket only to spread cancer in our society already burdened with so many diseases.” 
Shama Gulani representing lady health workers criticised the Sindh government’s decision to abolish the health risk allowance and demanded that pension should be awarded to workers. 
“We deliver health and social care services under increasingly challenging circumstances amid the spiralling cost of living. Long working hours, poor working conditions, low wages and insecure contracts have taken a heavy toll on us,” Halima Zulqarnain Laghari noted. 
Mir Zulfikar Ali from WERO and senior journalist Sheher Bano also spoke.

He added that following a 90-days preventive detention, both the accused were handed over to the police, which booked and arrested them in the present case and also claimed recovery of the weapon.
Mr Ahmed said that Shahab, who was already in custody in connection with two cases pertaining to alleged illicit weapons and explosives, was challaned in the present case under the Section 512 of the Criminal Procedure Code on May 4, 2017.

9,Nationalist parties in Sindh reject ‘bid’ to hand over provincial functions to centre,Leaders of Sindh Action Committee claim two resolutions passed by Sindh Assembly are a conspiracy aimed at imposing One Unit.,"HYDERABAD: Leaders of Sindh Action Committee, an alliance of major nationalist parties, have rejected formation of parliamentary committee on new provinces and Sindh Assembly’s resolution for handing over provincial functions to the federation.
The committee, which met in Jamshoro on Wednesday with its convener Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah in the chair, said the two resolutions passed by Sindh Assembly regarding Articles 144 and 147 were a conspiracy aimed at imposing One Unit.
The meeting attended by Sindh United Party president Syed Zain Shah, Qaumi Awami Tehreek president Ayaz Latif Palijo, Jeay Sindh Mahaz-Riaz chairman Riaz Ali Chandio, Sindh Taraqqi-pasand Party leader Hoat Khan Gadhi, Awami Jamhoori Party president Syed Jalal Shah, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz president Aslam Khairpuri, Porhiyat Muzahemat Tehreek president Syed Masroor Shah and others decided to observe 24 hours hunger strikes in divisional headquarters on Jan 7 and 8.
Palijo said that SAC had demanded that parliamentary committee on the creation of new provinces should be disbanded immediately and resolutions passed by Sindh Assembly about functions of provinces under Articles 144 and 147 should also be withdrawn forthwith.
He said that the committee had decided to observe hunger strike in divisional headquarters on Jan 7 and 8 against the conspiracies against Sindh. 
The committee, he said, had urged Sindh’s bar councils to convene to pass resolutions against the anti-Sindh decisions. He equated the passage of resolution over Articles 144 and 147 with rolling back of 18th constitutional amendment by PPP government and added that PPP was doing it to perpetuate its rule and make Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari prime minister in future.
He said that resolutions were aimed at handing over provincial government’s functions to the federation to allow investment in mineral resources. Not only this but Sindh’s islands and lands were also being handed over to federation under a conspiracy, he said.
He said the federal government with the consent of PPP had formed a committee to amend the Constitution to tinker with Sindh’s geography and create new provinces. It was an attempt to impose One Unit to occupy the province, he said. 
He said that despite lapse of four months various districts were still under water and people were living under open skies in winter season. They were facing diseases while millions of dollars international aid was falling prey to favouritism and corruption, he said.
He pointed out that agricultural loans were not written off and seed or fertiliser were not provided to farmers to cultivate their land for next crop. Internally displaced persons who reached Karachi were being forced to return to their villages, he said.
He said that efforts were being made to impose economic emergency but orgies of elites were not being stopped.
Riaz Chandio said that parliamentary committee on new provinces was a big conspiracy and accused PPP of destroying the province for the sake of power. Natural resources and executive powers of provincial government were being handed over to the federation, he said. 
SUP leader Roshan Buriro said that PPP had always looted wealth and resources of Sindh for the sake of power. It had sold Sindh’s land and now it was amending law to withdraw its authority to get fourth term in government in a row.

10,Issuance of CNICs to foreigners made more difficult: Nadra chief,LARKANA: National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) Chairman Muhammed Tarique Malik said on Wednesday that...,"LARKANA: National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) Chairman Muhammed Tarique Malik said on Wednesday that the organisation had refused to issue computerised national identity cards (CNICs) to 1,427 Afghan nationals. 
Talking to journalists after inaugurating a Nadra registration centre here, he said the Afghans were coming from borders and not landing by parachutes. He said they had been issued identity cards when the process was manual, but today the authority had biometric system and it had become quite difficult for the Afghans or foreigners to get a CNIC issued. 
He said: “The system has changed and now we have information prior to issuing identity card to any Afghan. We can confirm that the Afghan has entered from Chaman, Torkham, Angoor Ada or other areas as Nadra has installed biometric devices at the border and database begins formatting as soon as one enters the country.” 
Now due to the modern biometric system, Nadra could check their transition as well, he said. “People are our eyes and ears, therefore, they must check ground realities,” he added. 
He said that a TikToker had uploaded a news on social media about six months ago regarding recovery of 390 national ID cards from Afghans. “We kept on searching and verifying it, but none of the Afghans was identified having Pakistani CNIC,” he said. He said that such news was more often floated when Nadra was very close to win international contracts. 
He said that with the establishment of the new Nadra centre, they would be able to issue 300 to 500 CNICs per day. Due to the recent unprecedented rains and floods, some 58 Nadra centers had been affected in Sindh and of them, 57 were put in operation again, he said. The worst-affected center in flood was that of Pir Jo Goth which they were going to inaugurate on Wednesday, he said. 
He disclosed that a campaign would be launched from January 2023 to reissue the CNICs missed during flood free of cost.

The protesters’ leaders complained to media persons that their land in 30 villages had been illegally occupied to lay pipeline for the water supply scheme. 
Neither the government functionaries concerned nor executives of the mining firms engaged in coal extraction and power production in the area bothered to pay compensation for the surveyed land they had appropriated for the scheme, they said. 
They alleged that instead of being provided adequate compensation the landowners were being threatened by the officials to scare them into keeping silent over the injustice. 
They feared that they might be implicated in FIRs on flimsy charges in the same way as the villagers who were booked a few years back when they had held protests against the same flawed scheme. 
They said the mining firms, which did not tire of boasting that they had brought prosperity to the desert region, were causing irreparable damage to ecology and environment of the area. 
The villagers ended the daylong protest after some officials arrived at the protest venue and assured them of resolving their genuine issues. 
The officials assured that they had formed a six-member committee to resolve the issues after talks between the two sides. 
They would remove the contractors for the scheme, who according to them, were to blame for creating the problems, said the villagers.

14,"No respite from price hike as milk, yogurt being sold at exorbitant rates in Karachi",Milk sells at Rs190 a litre against official rate of Rs180; half-hearted efforts being made to enforce official prices.,"• Milk sells at Rs190 a litre against official rate of Rs180
• Half-hearted efforts being made to enforce official prices
• Retailers blame wholesalers for violating official rate  
KARACHI: Despite getting an increase of Rs10 per litre from Karachi commissioner in loose milk rate, which is now officially set at Rs180 per litre, most retailers defying the official rate sell loose milk at Rs190 per litre in the metropolis.
With the jump in milk prices, the price of yogurt has also gone up to Rs280-300 from Rs260-280 per kilo depending on the area.   
Meanwhile, no visible action is taken by authorities to impose the official milk rates in the city.  
The retailers said that it was hard for them to sell milk at the official rate after procuring the dairy product at ‘higher’ rates from wholesalers.  
However, some retailers have kept the rate at Rs180 per litre either for fear of strict action from regulator like heavy fines or by compromising the quality of milk by adding more water into it.  
The Karachi commissioner had on Dec 16 increased the retail price of milk from Rs170 to Rs180. The official rate of wholesale was also increased from Rs160 per litre to Rs170.  
The media coordinator of the Karachi Milk Retailers Association, Waheed Gaddi, told Dawn that 60-70 per cent of milk retailers in the city had started charging Rs190 per litre for loose milk from consumers after purchasing milk at Rs182-184 per litre from wholesalers whose official rate was fixed at Rs170 per litre.  
He said that some one to two per cent of retailers were selling milk at Rs200 per litre.  
He claimed that the government did not take notice of the price hike by the wholesalers and never imposed any fine on them. “The government finds it easy to grill the retailers for overcharging and imposes heavy fines, which is unjustified,” he added.  
Mr Waheed claimed that dairy farmers were selling milk to wholesalers at official rate of Rs163 per litre, but the wholesalers were not ready to provide milk to retailers at the commissioner’s rate.  
He said 90 per cent wholesalers were situated in Malir while a majority of cattle colonies were also located in the same area.  
Amid harsh economic conditions due to soaring cost of living, it is calculated that a typical consumer may brave a monthly bill of Rs5,700 for daily consumption of one litre of milk after Rs10 per litre increase as previously he was paying Rs5,400 in the same head last month.
Speaking to Dawn, Shakir Gujjar of Dairy and Cattle Farmers’ Association had claimed that the official rate was totally against the market reality because the cost of production of one litre milk was Rs200 while the dairy farmers’ price had been fixed at Rs163 per litre.  
He had demanded that the milk price was fixed at Rs230 per litre after taking into account freight rates and profit of middlemen and retailers.

15,Teachers in Karachi vow to continue protest as minister hints at accepting demands,Police hold back protesters from marching on CM House.,"KARACHI: As a large number of schoolteachers staged a protest outside the Karachi Press Club and tried to proceed towards Chief Minister House on Wednesday, Sindh Education Minister Sardar Shah said that fair and justified demands of the protesting primary-school teachers could be accepted.  
The protesting teachers under the banner of the Primary Teachers Association gathered outside the Karachi Press Club and staged a sit-in to put pressure on the government for the acceptance of their demands, including regularisation of teachers recruited from 2001 to 2019 across the province.  
The protesters, who raised slogans against the provincial government, said that some of their colleagues had been manhandled and pushed back harshly by police, though the teachers remained peaceful.  
Speaking to Dawn, the education minister said that protesting teachers were demanding upgradation of primary-school teachers from grade 9 to 14 as the fresh primary teachers were appointed in grade 14.  

Police hold back protesters from marching on CM House

“This is already in our policy and the post has already been upgraded,” he added.  
He said that the matter pertaining to promotions of primary-school teachers to the post of headmaster in some districts was under consideration and it would be resolved soon.  
The special secretary of the education department, Pervez Baloch, visited the protesters at the sit-in and held talks with them, but the issue could not be resolved.  
Later, the protesting teachers dispersed peacefully with a warning that they would hold another demonstration in front of CM House if their demands were not met.  
Speaking on the occasion, PTA Sindh president Shafi Mohammad said that hundreds of teachers, including male and female, who had been recruited between 2001 and 2019 in Sindh still could not be regularised despite the teachers who had been appointed in other three provinces had been regularised.  
He said that the nation could not make progress until teachers were given their rights.  
He urged the education minister to hold talks with teachers and resolve their issues immediately.  
The PTA Sindh leader demanded that primary teachers recruited from 2001 to 2019 should be regularised forthwith, biometric system should be shifted to district level from the provincial level to help teachers, and the allowance of headmasters should be raised to Rs5,000 to Rs10,000.  
The PTA leader warned that if their demands were not accepted, they would march on CM House.  
He said that they were protesting peacefully for their rights as they were employed after passing the national testing service test.  
The government had promised to regularise their jobs, but the promise could not be fulfilled yet, which was the matter of great concern, he concluded.
