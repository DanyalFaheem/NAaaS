• Restructuring, re-deployments said to be on the table amid talk of austerity measures
ISLAMABAD: The army on Wednesday signalled a strong response to the country’s escalating terrorism problem.
The corps commanders at their monthly conference at the General Headquarters — the first after the change of command last month, according to ISPR, “resol­ved to fight against terrorists without any distinction and eliminate this menace as per the aspirations of the people of Pakistan”.
The two-day conference, which began on Tuesday, was chaired by Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir.
The media statement indicated that the focus of the discussion remained largely on the resurgence of terrorism in the country, even though the commanders also undertook a “review of professional and organisational matters of the Army”.

 





 
The surge in terrorism incidents in Khyber-Pakh­tun­khwa and Balochistan provinces and more importantly the botched suicide bombing attempt in Islamabad in which a policeman lost his life last Friday underscore the growing problem of militant violence, which has further complicated the challenges of political instability and economic meltdown.
In the past few months, over a hundred attacks have been claimed by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), whose leadership has been operating from Afghanis­­tan. These attacks have mostly targeted the law enforcement agencies. 
While the most significant threat is coming from TTP, at the same time insurgents in Balochistan have also stepped up their attacks. They have, moreover, formed a nexus with TTP, making the problem even more complex. 
This nexus is being seen as one of the reasons why TTP has been able to stage so many attacks in Balochistan.
Amid indicators that the terrorist threat may increase next year, analysts have been criticising the military for not coming up with a comprehensive strategy to counter it.
The brief ISPR statement did not specifically mention if some new kinetic operation had been okayed, but its tone and almost single focus on the terrorism threat put across the message that counter-terrorism would be the new leadership’s top priority.
Gen Munir had soon after taking over the command visited the western border and had reiterated the pledge to end the menace of terrorism at all costs, while emphasising that no one will be allowed to spoil the hard earned peace.
The new army chief’s messaging has been less through words and more through optics. His resolve to fight back the terrorists was clear from a recent picture of sombre, but firm-looking Gen Munir carrying the coffin of Capt Fahd Khan along with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza. Capt Fahd was martyred over the weekend in an IED blast in Kahan, Balochistan.
The reference to “review of professional and organisational matters” suggested that the top brass could have considered restructuring and redeployments especially in midst of reports that certain austerity measures were being planned.
Besides, there were some crucial issues about which the statement was completely silent.
The corps commanders conference happened in the backdrop of intensifying economic crisis, but there was no mention of the economic security that remained a major concern during Gen Munir’s predecessor’s tenure.
As the Army says it has decided to remain out of governance and political matters, it is plausible that the generals did not discuss economy in deference of that policy decision. Interestingly, the conference happened as rumours about a meeting for discussing the possibility of installation of a technocrats’ government for fixing the economy made rounds.
Similarly, there was nothing on the review of external and regional security in the media statement especially relating to India and Afghanistan.

1,PTI blames terror resurgence on reversal of its Afghan policy,"""If the situation in Kabul deteriorates, it will have negative implications for Islamabad as well,"" says Fawad Chaudhry.","ISLAMABAD: Amid a rise in terror attacks across the country, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Fawad Chaudhry on Wednesday linked the resurgence of terrorism with what he called the “reversal of PTI government’s policy on Afghanistan”.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the former information minister said Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari did not understand the situation in Afghanistan. He added if the situation in Kabul deteriorated it would have negative implications for Islamabad as well.
Mr Chaudhry claimed that former prime minister Imran Khan was the “only respected Pakistani leader” in Afghanistan because his “hands were not tainted with the blood” of Afghans.
 
 

He added that bombs and missiles were not a solution and that matters should be resolved through dialogue.
The PTI leader also highlighted the situation in the former Fata region and said since its merger with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the government did not spend any money on the development of the tribal districts.
He went on to claim that the cabinet never got a briefing on the Afghanistan situation and on the merger of the erstwhile Fata region. He said the interior minister did not even visit Wana to make himself aware of the problems faced by the locals.

Fawad terms idea of setting up technocrat government a ‘joke’

‘Technocrat government’
The PTI leader also talked about rumours of a ‘technocrat setup’ being proposed to replace the PDM government. He said the idea of sending the PDM government packing and installing a long-term technocrat government was under consideration to stop Imran Khan from coming back to power.
 
 

He warned that a system in contrast to the Constitution was not acceptable and PTI would resist such attempts.
Terming the alleged idea of installing a technocrat setup and importing a technocrat from the US a ‘joke’, he said a technocrat government could not solve the country’s current issues, as it would plunge the country into a host of problems and then these technocrats would flee.
He said that the National Assembly speaker and the Senate chairman were prestigious posts throughout the globe, but in Pakistan, the incumbent speaker and the chairman were oblivious to the dignity associated with their offices.
The PTI leader alleged Rs1.7 billion was spent on foreign tours undertaken by FM Bhutto-Zardari since the change of government in April.
He also claimed that the PTI lawmakers did not draw salaries after their resignations from the assembly and alleged PTI leaders’ salaries might have been received by the PDM members.
The PTI leader alleged PM Shehbaz Sharif went to China with a delegation comprising 43 members, but Beijing told them it would only host five officials and asked the premier to pay for the rest of the delegation.

2,Efforts to resolve Gwadar unrest yet to bear fruit,"""We will fulfill our responsibility to restore long-lasting peace in the province,"" says Balochistan govt spokesperson.","QUETTA / GWADAR: Tensions continued to simmer in the port city of Gwadar on Wednesday with a shutter down strike continuing for a third day as police arrested a number of protesters amid clashes with supporters of the Haq Do Tehreek (HDT).
Although the home minister had directed police officials to register a case against the HDT chief after firing during clashes a day earlier claimed the life of a policeman, an FIR was yet to be registered against Maulana Hidayatur Rehman. 
Sources told Dawn that the government had contacted Jamaat-i-Islami leader Liaquat Baloch to help restore normalcy and resolving the issues that have become a bone of contention between the government and the HDT. 
Reportedly, Maulana Rehman belongs to the JI and also holds the position of Balochistan general secretary.
On Wednesday, protesters took to main roads and highways linking Gwadar with other towns and cities of Makran, blocking the thoroughfares for all kinds of incoming and outgoing traffic. 
According to reports, protesters also besieged the residence of the Gwadar deputy commissioner and other offices. However, police lobbed tear gas shells and fired blank shots to disperse the mob.
The HDT has claimed that police and Frontier Corps personnel have arrested over 80 people in Gwadar and Pasni town during the protest. A strike was also reported in Pasni, Ormara, Jeweni, Surbander and Pishikan areas of Gwadar district.
Strongly condemning the arrests firing and teargassing of protesters, Maulana Rehman said: “Our protest was peaceful for the last two months and it will remain peaceful, but baton charge and the lobbing tear gas on peaceful protesters would not be tolerated”.
He demanded that all those arrested from Gwadar and other cities be released without any delay.
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Balochistan government said the government would fulfill its responsibility to restore long-lasting peace and protect the lives and property of the people. 
Around 900 more police personnel have been deployed in the city, he said, adding that protesters had been dispersed from several key roads, while Marine Drive and the port road have been opened for traffic.

3,PCB to allow free entry for second Test,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board will allow fans to attend the second Test against New Zealand for free, a PCB...","KARACHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board will allow fans to attend the second Test against New Zealand for free, a PCB spokesperson said on Wednesday.
The first Test, currently underway here at the National Stadium, has seen poor fan attendance and empty stands.
The National Stadium is also the venue for the second Test as it was shifted from Multan last week due to heavy fog and deteriorating weather conditions there.
“We will have free entry for the second Test with tickets available on a first-come, first-served basis,” the PCB spokesperson told Dawn. “An official announ­cement in that regard will follow in due course.”
All stands will be open to fans apart from the two VIP enclosures — the Javed Miandad and Hanif Moha­mmad enclosures — whose tickets are worth Rs500 for a single-day viewing.
The second Test will be played from Jan 2 to 6 and it has been learnt that the PCB management committee, headed by Najam Sethi, has reached out to educational institutions, orphanages and old homes in order to fill up the venue.
Earlier this month, many fans stayed away from the third and final Test between the hosts and England at the National Stadium.
The problem arose after the PCB asked those with online tickets to reach a printing booth to get their tickets printed. At the culmination of the series, though, International Cricket Council CEO Geoff Allardice had said that he was keen to see more Test cricket being played in  Pakistan because the fans had shown great interest.
“The fans in Pakistan are passionate about the game and passionate about their team, but most importantly they are welcoming of visitors,” Allardice said.
That passion, however, seems to have died down for New Zealand’s first Test in the country in 20 years. Now the PCB is looking to revive that.

4,Panel formed to cut power use in govt offices by 30pc,PM orders swift implementation of Kissan package,"ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Wednesday decided to implement National Energy Efficiency and Conservation (NEEC) plan with full vigour across the country and, as a first step, formed a committee to cut 30 per cent use of electricity in government offices. 
A meeting of the cabinet, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also decided to complete consultation with the provinces on the plan, commonly called ‘energy saving plan’, that was announced by the premier on Tuesday. 
In a separate meeting, the prime minister directed the authorities concerned to swiftly implement the Kissan package to provide relief to farmers and boost agriculture growth in the country. 
The committee on reduction of 30pc consumption of electricity in government offices comprises the ministers for energy and planning, the minister of state for petroleum and natural resources and relevant secretaries. 

PM orders swift implementation of Kissan package

According to the Prime Minister Office, the cabinet meeting was informed that the Ministry of Information and the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority have also prepared an awareness campaign about energy saving and austerity. 
“The prime minister directed completion of the consultation process with all the stakeholders, including the provincial governments, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan governments as soon as possible to ensure the implementation of the ‘proposed energy saving plan,” said an official press release. 
PM Sharif emphasised that the nation needed to adopt austerity measures with regard to energy and urgently required change in attitudes. He said the implementation of the energy saving plan and the use of alternative energy were indispensable to reduce the import bill in terms of fuel. 
The cabinet condemned the arrest of senior parliamentarian Chaudhry Ashraf by the Punjab government in a 53-year-old case as a step of political vendetta. 
The cabinet offered Fateha for those martyred during incidents of terrorism in different parts of the country. It paid tribute to the security forces for their continuous fight against terrorism. 
The meeting was given a detailed briefing by the Ministry of Industries and Production on generalisation of the use of electric motorbikes across the country.
It was highlighted that currently 90 companies were manufacturing motorcycles and auto rickshaws in the country with a capacity to manufacture 6m motorcycles annually. It was informed that 22 companies had been issued licences to manufacture electric bikes in Pakistan. The meeting was informed that promotion of electric bikes would save a lot in terms of fuel. 
The prime minister issued instructions for submission of a detailed plan regarding electric bikes to the Economic Coordination Committee. 
The cabinet approved the Government-to-Government Commercial Transaction Act 2022 (G2G Commercial Transaction Act 2022). On the recommendation of the Board of Investment, the cabinet approved, in principle, the One Stop Service Act to provide facilities to investors in special economic zones established across the country. 
Kissan package 
Later, presiding over a separate meeting, PM Sharif said development of agriculture sector is the guarantor of food security and directed accelerating the implementation of Kissan package to facilitate the farmers. 
In October this year, the government had announced a special package of Rs1,800 billion to promote the agriculture sector, including provision of free seeds and inexpensive loans and bringing down the prices of fertilisers and electricity for tube wells. 
PM Sharif stressed the need for ensuring food security in Pakistan at all costs and directed the authorities concerned to pay special attention to cultivation and production of wheat, cotton, canola and olive. He called for ensuring supply of better seeds to increase production of other food grains, including pulses. 
The meeting was informed about the implementation of Kissan package, youth loan scheme, interest waiver for small farmers and provision of interest-free agricultural loans to small farmers in the flood-affected areas through State Bank’s notification to banks, for which instructions have been issued. 
In the current financial year till November, agricultural loans worth Rs664 billion have been given to farmers, which is 36pc more compared to the loans disbursed during the same period of previous financial year.

5,Dar rubbishes ‘default mantra’ but admits economic situation is dire,‘Pseudo-intellectuals’ assailed for raising spectre of sovereign default.,"KARACHI: Finance Minister Ishaq Dar assured investors on Wednesday that “there’s no way Pakistan is going to default”, though he agreed that all was not well with the economy.
“We’re in a tight position. We don’t have $24bn in foreign exchange reserves that our (last) government left in 2016. But that’s not my fault. It’s the system’s fault,” he told investors at a ceremony to mark the listing of Pakistan’s first developmental real estate investment trust scheme on the stock exchange.
Mr Dar also assailed “pseudo-intellectuals” for raising the spectre of sovereign default even though the country repaid its $1 billion Islamic bond before maturity early this month.
“There’s no way Pakistan is going to default,” he repeatedly declared in his largely backward-looking speech via video link.

‘Pseudo-intellectuals’ assailed for raising spectre of sovereign default

Mr Dar’s reference to pseudo-intellectuals appears to be a dig at his predecessor Dr Miftah Ismail, a PhD in economics, who has been vocal about the possibility of default in his newspaper columns and TV appearances since leaving office in September.
“We’re hurting the country over petty politics… we’re our own worst enemy,” he said.
Building on the generous praise by earlier speakers for his supposed financial wizardry, Mr Dar patted himself on the back for lifting Pakistan out of economic quagmires in 1998, 2008 and 2013.
Citing statistics on inflation, key interest rate, foreign direct investment and share market benchmark, he said the economy was in sound shape the last time he left office in 2017. He asked the business community to hold accountable the set of politicians that followed the last PML-N government in power.
The only time Pakistan completed an International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme was under the PML-N government, he said, while vowing to fulfil all IMF conditions this time as well.
Striking a populist tone, however, Mr Dar said Pakistan couldn’t be held “hostage” to the dictates of others. “We shouldn’t put more burden on people either if we can’t give them relief. We have delivered on our commitment on the petroleum development levy while reducing petroleum prices three times,” he said.
The external account is the biggest challenge and the government is trying to improve the situation, he said. “We’ve identified more external resources and inflows. We’ll be in a much better position with respect to the external account and reserves by the end of the fiscal year,” he said.
Referring to a notification issued by the central bank a day ago, the finance minister also took credit for lifting some of the import curbs on essential items.
“Our ultimate goal should be to avoid going to the multilaterals,” he said, adding that Pakistan should ideally be able to access funds through the international debt market.
In an ominous note, he said the key interest rate in Turkiye is just 9pc even though inflation is hovering around 60pc. Mr Dar is known to be a staunch supporter of keeping the interest rate low even in the midst of high inflation — an approach that runs counter to conventional economic wisdom.
Inflation in Pakistan is imported and linked to devaluation, he said, noting that the central bank and its interest rate–setting committee are “autonomous”.

6,UN report uses Pakistan floods to warn of more disasters,"Little headway made at COP27 on phasing out of fossil fuels, climate report notes.","UNITED NATIONS: This summer’s floods in Pakistan were a stark reminder that the changing climate will bring more disasters in the near future, warns a UN report released on Wednesday.
The United Nations’ 2022 Year in Review report on Climate and Environment notes that “whilst some regions suffered from a lack of water” in the outgoing year, others were hit by catastrophic floods. 
“In Pakistan, a national emergency was declared in August, following heavy flooding and landslides caused by monsoon rains which, at the height of the crisis, saw around a third of the country underwater. Tens of millions were displaced,” the report adds.
The UN is hosting an international conference on Climate Resilient Pakistan in Geneva on Jan 9 to consider various options for supporting the country in dealing with the consequences of the changing climate.
Quoting from various UN-sponsored studies, the report underlines the continued warming of the Earth as a major threat and regrets the failure of humanity to lower carbon emissions and get to grips with the climate emergency. 
The report also emphasises the need to cut fossil fuel use, and support developing countries in dealing with man-made climate changes, causing droughts, floods, and extreme weathers.
The UN report also refers to a recent study by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), which shows that heat waves will occur more and more frequently, into the 2060s.

Little headway made at COP27 on phasing out of fossil fuels, climate report notes

WMO, a UN weather agency, notes that the pattern is linked to the warming of the planet, caused by human activities. The changing climate raises “serious concerns for the planet’s future”, the report warns.
The UN report also quotes from a WMO Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, which details record levels of the three main gases — carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, and methane, which saw the biggest year-on-year jump in concentrations in 40 years.
It identifies human activity as a principal factor in this change. “Despite all the evidence that a shift to a low-carbon economy is urgently needed, the world’s major economies responded to the energy crisis precipitated by the war in Ukraine by reopening old power plants and searching for new oil and gas suppliers,” the report notes. 
‘Delusional’ reaction 
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has decried their reaction as “delusional”, reminding the rich nations that if they had invested in renewable energy in the past, they could have avoided the price instability of the fossil fuel markets.
In another statement, Mr Guterres compared the behaviour of the fossil fuel industry to the activities of major tobacco companies in the mid-twentieth century: “Like tobacco interests, fossil fuel interests and their financial accomplices must not escape responsibility,” he said. “The argument of putting climate action aside to deal with domestic problems also rings hollow”.
In July, the UN General Assembly declared that access to a clean and healthy environment is a universal human right. Mr Guterres hoped that the landmark declaration would help reduce environmental injustices, close protection gaps, and empower people to deal with climate disasters.
The UN report, however, notes with satisfaction that in November the UN Climate Conference in Egypt established a funding mechanism to compensate vulnerable nations for the loss and damage caused by climate-induced disasters. 
The report notes that since vulnerable nations have spent decades arguing for such a provision, the inclusion was hailed as a major advance. However, it also notes that little headway was made on other key issues, particularly on the phasing out of fossil fuels, and tightened language on the need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.
