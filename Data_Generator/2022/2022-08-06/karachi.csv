5,"Sindh, Punjab barrages record  ‘abrupt fall’ in discharges",Water level at Guddu rises to touch medium flood mark...,"HYDERABAD: The water level at Guddu Barrage on Friday rose to peak medium flood whereas a similar situation would be witnessed at Sukkur Barrage within the next 36-48 hours, barrage officials said on Friday evening.
This season’s peak medium flood is passing through Guddu Barrage at the moment while Sukkur Barrage remained in a state of low flood, according to them. 
Guddu barrage had started receiving medium flood at around noon on Thursday (Aug 4) when it passed 352,171 cusecs of floodwater against upstream discharge of 384,984 cusecs. 
According to irrigation department, a discharge of 350,000 cusecs is considered medium flood. Subsequently, Guddu Barrage today (Aug 5) passed 386,589 cusecs of water downstream with an upstream discharge of 415,999 at 6pm.

Water level at Guddu rises to touch medium flood mark

The Sukkur Barrage passed 300,050 cusecs of water downstream at 6pm with upstream discharge of 336,650 cusecs. Kotri Barrage reported an upstream discharge of 185,891 cusecs and 164,966 cusecs downstream to stay in normal position. It may pass a low flood as well in the days to come.
Abrupt fall in discharge
Statistics show that an abrupt fall in discharge is being noted at different barrages in upper reaches, which indicate low discharges. 
Chashma Barrage that had reported downstream discharge of 337,460 cusecs at 6am on Aug 3 is showing a discharge of 130,298 cusecs as recorded at 6pm today. This figure shows an abrupt fall of 200,000 cusecs.
Taunsa Barrage is recording a discharge of 194,637 cusecs downstream against the Aug 3 discharge of 381,243 cusecs. 
Panjnad Barrage also shows a similar trend. Its flows enter Indus River at Chachran. The barrage was recording a flow of 112,564 cusecs on Aug 3 and 48 hours later, it’s showing a discharge of 85,211 cusecs at 6pm today.
Indus at Tarbela was recording an inflow of 323,600 cusecs on July 30 and an outflow of 244,500 cusecs. This means that inflow had dropped to 297,000 cusecs on Aug 1, 270,000 cusecs on Aug 2, 228,000 cusecs on Aug 3, 200,500 cusecs on Aug 4. On Aug 5, it recorded an inflow of 165,500 cusecs, showing a difference of 158,100 cusecs.
Flows for Sindh are mostly released from Tarbela. Punjab also gets water from Indus through link canals. The dam is still 13 feet short of its optimum storage of 1,550 feet given its Aug 5 storage level of 1,537.56 feet.
The right bank canals of Sukkur barrage are having full discharges to supply water to their command areas where sowing of paddy has been delayed. “An abrupt fall in upper reaches of the Indus river system means that Sukkur Barrage may start facing a shortage of water if there is no more rainfall in upper Sindh,” said an irrigation official at Sukkur barrage.

12,JI moves SHC for early polling date of local govt elections,KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) on Friday approached the Sindh High Court against postponement of the second phase...,"KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) on Friday approached the Sindh High Court against postponement of the second phase of local government (LG) elections in Sindh.
City chief of JI Hafiz Naeemur Rehman and another JI leader filed a petition stating that the four-year tenure of the previously elected local governments in Sindh had expired on Aug 30, 2020 and instead of holding elections, the Sindh government had appointed administrators across the province.
They argued that Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab was a political person and allegedly providing government machinery and funds to the candidates of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to promote and build their campaign and image.
Citing the Election Commission of Pakistan, provincial election commissioner and Sindh chief secretary as respondents, the petitioners argued that the LG polls were postponed with mala fide intention and sought a directive the for ECP to announce an early date for holding elections.
They submitted that initially, the Sindh government had deliberately delayed the delimitation process by not providing the details and required maps of union committees while the ECP was bound to hold elections within 120 days after the end of the tenure of the previous LG government.
Thereafter, the petitioners submitted that the provincial government had provided the data after the ECP had issued a warning.
The JI had serious reservations over voter list and the delimitation, which was carried out totally on political grounds to provide maximum benefit to the ruling party in Sindh, but still it welcomed the LG elections, it added.
They argued that the ECP had postponed the elections just three days before the second phase scheduled to be held on July 24 in Karachi and Hyderabad divisions and fixed Aug 28 as the new date for polling.
They contended that the reasons incorporated in the impugned notification of the ECP to postpone the LG elections were lame excuses having no base. 
Some political parties were pressuring for the postponement of the polls and they succeeded in manipulation of their aim to delay it, they added.
The petitioners submitted that the ECP had cited Muharram and forecast of heavy rain as reasons to delay the elections. They argued that the Met office had been issuing such forecasts for the past two months and only five per cent of such forecasts were found correct while Muharram was starting six days after the elections.
They further submitted that on June 24, the SHC had also dismissed the petitions of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan seeking postponement of the LG election and ruled that no case for staying the elections was made out by the petitioners.
The petitioners also pleaded to set aside the impugned notification and for publication of fresh ballot papers with different colours to avoid malpractice and rigging.

13,Notice issued to Rao Anwar on defamation suit by ex-IGP AD Khawaja,"Former police chief accuses Rao of involvement in extrajudicial killings, collusion with land-grabbers, mafia.","KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday issued a notice to former Malir SSP Rao Anwar on a lawsuit filed by former inspector general of police (IGP) A. D. Khawaja, who is currently serving as a grade-22 officer of Police Service of Pakistan, against a defamatory interview on a private news channel.
A single-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi also restrained the former SSP or anybody else acting on his behalf from repeating, circulating and broadcasting the defamatory interview till Aug 31.
The former police chief of Sindh alleged that Rao Anwar was involved in extrajudicial killings and during his time as the IGP he was completely unhappy with him due to his disobedience, misconduct, extra-departmental influences, high-handedness, involvement in land-grabbing and collusion with reti, bajri mafia.
In the lawsuit, Mr Khawaja submitted that he was a respectable police officer of BPS-22 and currently posted as the commandant at the National Police Academy at Islamabad.

Former police chief accuses Rao of involvement in extrajudicial killings, collusion with land-grabbers, mafia

Representing Mr Khawaja, Advocate Amna Usman argued that the plaintiff had challenged the illegal and mala fide conduct of the defendant in giving the defamatory interview against him at a talk-show on a private news channel on June 18.


Former SSP Rao Anwar along with his team.

 
She stated that the defamatory and scandalous interview of the defendant against the plaintiff was also available on YouTube and other social/digital media platforms.
She contended that the intention of the defendant while giving the impugned interview was to ridicule the plaintiff and to make unjust criticism not only on Mr Khawaja but also against the former chief justice of Pakistan.
The counsel stated that the defendant was allegedly involved in numerous cases of extrajudicial killings including the killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud in a staged encounter.
The plaintiff in the suit submitted that he had an unblemished career of over 35 years and had served as the IGP-Sindh from 2016 to 2018.
He contended that in the impugned interview, the defendant had levelled false and baseless allegations against him about alleged misuse of his powers in the formation of an inquiry committee by selecting members of his choice to probe into the extrajudicial killings by the defendant.
It was further contended in the lawsuit that during the impugned interview, the defendant also alleged that the father of the deceased Naqeebullah was summoned to Karachi by the plaintiff by sending a vehicles of the Sindh police as he was not willing to come, and register a case against the defendants and others.
It maintained that the former SSP further alleged in the interview that the plaintiff had worked on the instructions of the former chief justice of Pakistan in the matters against the defendant while the plaintiff had also allegedly instructed the defendant to kill whatever criminals apprehend and dump their bodies.
The plaintiff submitted that all the allegations were patently false, unverified and outrightly mala fide as the inquiry committee to probe into the allegations of extrajudicial killings was made in accordance with law and the selection of the members and the report of the committee had not been challenged by the defendant in any court.
He further argued that the FIR was lodged on the request of the father and friends of Naqeeb and the vehicles were provided as they had apprehended serious threats to their life from defendant and his team.
The plaintiff also strongly refuted to have entered into any conversation with the defendant regarding killing of criminals he had apprehended and argued that in fact, the plaintiff was completely unhappy with the defendant due to his disobedience and misconduct on many accounts due to his extra-departmental influences, high-handedness, involvement in land-grabbing and collusion with reti, bajri mafia. 
After a preliminary hearing, the bench in its order said: “Let notices are to be issued to the defendant through all modes except publication. In the meantime, the defendant and /or anybody else acting for and on behalf of defendant are restrained from repeating, circulating, broadcasting and publishing the defamatory interview dated 18.06.2022 subject matter of this suit and or any clip or content or extract from that defamatory interview and /or making any other defamatory, malicious and scandalous material/content against the plaintiff in social, digital and print media, till next date of hearing.”
