0,PCB confident PSL faces no threat from IPL-backed emerging leagues,PCB CEO believes PSL can rely on factors other than just money to find itself as a relevant product in T20 leagues market.,"KARACHI: Alarm bells are ringing for the Pakistan Super League. But perhaps not loud enough for the Pakistan Cricket Board, which is still confident about the product it is selling. Analysts and those involved with the PSL, however, are thinking differently.
Until its last edition in January this year, Pakistan’s flagship T20 event was being dubbed as the ‘second-best league in the world’ after the Indian Premier League.
Fast forward six months, before the turn of the season, the PSL has two more competitors challenging for the place behind IPL; UAE’s International League T20 and the yet-to-be-named T20 league backed by Cricket South Africa.
While these are just two new T20 leagues on the outside, what makes the competition complicated for the PSL is the fact that nine of the total 12 franchises of both the ILT20 and the CSA league are owned by owners of IPL teams.
“This rules out the PSL as the second-best league in the world at least in terms of money,” a top official of a PSL franchise told Dawn.
The ILT20 is set to offer its best players a whopping USD 450,000 while the CSA league’s recruits will earn up to USD 350,000.
The PSL on the other hand, will manage to pay a maximum compensation of USD 200,000 to the top players of the league.
According to a sports management expert associated with the local cricket industry, what makes it trickier for Pakistan’s flagship cricket event is the scheduling of the leagues in the future cycles.
Following the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup — which runs from October 16 to November 13 — the two-month Australian Big Bash League will kick off from December, after which the Bangladesh Premier League, the ILT20 and the South African League will be held almost simultaneously from mid-January to mid-February.
The PSL runs into action in the last week of February and finds itself sandwiched between the said leagues and the IPL, which is set to be held from March to May.
But PCB chief executive officer Faisal Hasnain believes the PSL can rely on factors other than just money to find itself as a relevant product in the increasingly competitive T20 leagues market.
“Firstly, our objective/vision is for the Pakistan Super League to continue to be a world-class league in its own right without comparisons with any other league,” Faisal told Dawn.
“We don’t look at any league as our competitor because we consider the quality of our cricket and our organisational ability and fan following to be second to none.”
There are fears of the PSL’s dates clashing with the ILT20 and the South African league as it eventually expands to eight teams from the 2025 season. The clash might decrease the PSL’s demand in the international market but may not affect its viewership locally.
“Our partners back our league and players due to their quality and the value that we offer and we are confident that they will remain with us regardless of the emergence of any other league in any part of the world,” Faisal said.
While the PSL “quality” due to the level playing field it is known to maintain batters and bowlers, may well keep it among the top leagues in the world, what cannot be ignored at the moment is the money its competitors are ready to splash on the players.
CRICKET CALENDAR
The placement of the PSL in the cricket calendar also makes it susceptible to losing its importance. 
“The talk in the market says the players will look to rejuvenate themselves in the PSL window after the BBL, South Africa league and the ILT20,” the franchise official said.
According to the expert, compared to the UAE and South Africa, Pakistan is not a favourable destination for the players due to the air-tight security arrangements which gave minimum freedom to players to move around or find avenues to entertain themselves while being away from home.
“Players aren’t able to move around freely while in Pakistan and that could become a much bigger challenge now,” he said. 
“In comparison, some of these other destinations are very attractive tourist destinations.”
With IPL owners penetrating the franchise T20 industry, recent reports have revealed that they are “open to offering” yearly contracts to the most sought after players to tie them up for all the leagues their teams will feature in. 
The PCB, according to the sports management expert, should do the same.
“One way to secure the PSL’s interest could be for the PCB to negotiate handsome longer-term contracts with some of the leading international players,” he said.
This could give the players a degree of security and comfort.
“PCB can invest in foreign player recruitment for the overall benefit of the PSL.”
Pakistan’s nose-diving economy triggered by the uncertain political climate and global recession, though, will pose a big challenge for the PCB to make a move as big as that.
While Faisal was confident that PSL’s global following and viewership figures will continue their upward trend and the tournament will earn more specially after securing record sponsorships and broadcast deals last year, the currency that fills the league’s central pool is the Pakistani rupee.
The payments that are made to the top foreign players — including the likes of Alex Hales, Jason Roy and Liam Livingstone — are in dollars, which makes it further complicated for the PSL to convince players to choose it over the other leagues. 
In such an environment, ideally, the PCB is expected to take steps to save what it has built along with the main stakeholders — the franchises — in the last eight years. 
Representatives of two different franchises expressed severe concerns over what they believed was lack of urgency by the PCB.
“We’re waiting for PCB to actually sit down and discuss it with us, but it’s not chairman’s priority,” one of them told Dawn. “PCB needs to start contacting and signing players before it’s too late, before every big player signs for another league.” 
The last time the PCB called the PSL’s governing council’s meeting was back in September 2021.
“There had been zero engagement by the PCB regarding the issue,” said a representative of the other franchise. 
The official said the franchises expected the PCB to invest more in the PSL rather than creating a brand new product in the Pakistan Junior League — a franchise-based T20 tournament for under-19 players.
DIFFERENT LENS
Faisal said the PCB looks at the PJL from a different lens.
“The Pakistan Junior League is a completely different concept and it is meant for the development of the game and should not necessarily be considered a commercial venture,” he said.
“The event will provide an opportunity for youngsters to showcase their talent and it is a part of the PCB’s pathway programme to encourage talent to provide a platform for them to graduate to national level.”
While the sports management expert believed that T20 leagues were “the new reality in cricket that boards need to coexist with” and that the PCB should just accept it, Faisal stressed that international bilateral cricket is here to stay.The ICC’s Future Tours Programme cycle for the 2024-2027 period will see T20 leagues take up a major chunk of the cricket calendar while a significant part of it will be occupied by the ICC events. This has raised questions over the future of international bilateral cricket.
“Each format of the game has its unique place within the cricketing structure and has added significantly to the spread of the game both commercially as well as in terms of innovation and this we believe is very good for the game,” said Faisal. 
“In fact, we believe that the new fans attracted by the shorter formats of the game will be attracted to the longer formats and therefore bilateral cricket between nations is here to stay.”

1,ICC hopes to retain all-format players despite busy calendar,NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is optimistic of retaining the game’s all-format players ...,"NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is optimistic of retaining the game’s all-format players despite their mounting workload in a busy calendar, chief executive Geoff Allardice said.
England talisman Ben Stokes quit the 50-overs format last month, citing an “unsustainable” schedule, while India’s Virat Kohli has been vocal about the growing workload on players. 
“There’ll still be all-format players,” Allardice told the ESPNcricinfo website. 
“Whether they play every match that their country schedules in those formats is a different question.”  
Proliferation of franchise-based leagues and the ICC’s own plans to have one global event every year have added strain to the calendar.
Allardice said players prioritising various formats was not a new phenomenon and that the current calendar had backlogs from when the pandemic had caused several series to be postponed.
“...certainly, the balance of players playing international cricket versus domestic leagues will continue to evolve,” he said. 
“I’m hoping that the best players play international cricket as often as they can.”  
Most players still had a “huge ambition” to play in World Cups and ICC events, he said. 
“It’s a case of finding that balance in how they spend their calendar year, across which international competitions, which series and which leagues they should play.”  
Besides, it was not a universal problem, he said. 
“There are only some countries that are going to need to do that. There’s a lot of countries wanting international fixtures. There’s no shortage of demand for international cricket among the members,” he said.
As for players’ workload, it was for individual boards to handle the issue, Allardice said. 
“The management of their players, it’s not something that necessarily bounces off to the ICC on any sort of regular basis.”

The home team lost openers Regis Chakabva and Tarisai Musakanda with just six runs on the scoreboard as they chased a formidable Bangladesh total of 303-2 that included four half centuries.
A third Zimbabwe wicket fell after they lifted the score to 62 and then Raza and Kaia came together to put on 192 runs for the fourth wicket and set up a brilliant victory as Zimbabwe reached 307-5 with 10 balls to spare.
Raza was unbeaten on 135, including six sixes and eight fours, while Kaia struck two sixes and 11 fours in his 110 before being caught by Shoriful Islam at short fine leg.
Bangladesh, seventh in the ODI rankings and eight places above Zimbabwe, took advantage of being put in to bat by building what appeared to be a winning score.
Opener Liton Das led the way with an unbeaten 81 before being forced to retire hurt with a suspected hamstring injury. He faced 89 balls and scored one six and nine fours.
Anamul Haque (73), captain Tamim Iqbal (62) and Mushfique Rahim (52) were the other scorers of half centuries for a team fresh from a 3-0 ODI hammering of the West Indies.
But while the visiting batsmen scored freely, their bowlers had no answers to Pakistan-born Raza and Kaia at Harare Sports Club.
The pair reached centuries within two balls of each other during the 39th over with Kaia scoring his maiden ton through a single while two runs from Raza gave him his fourth 100 in the 50-over format.
Victory continued a remarkable transformation of Zimbabwe since former batting star Dave Houghton began a second stint as coach after 3-0 ODI and Twenty20 whitewashes by Afghanistan in June.
They hosted a T20 World Cup qualifying tournament last month and won all five matches to clinch a place at the main event in Australia from October. Then, earlier this week, they edged Bangladesh by 10 runs in a thriller to snatch a 2-1 victory in a T20 series.

3,Injured Mbappe to miss PSG’s season opener,PARIS: Kylian Mbappe will miss Paris St-Germain’s first Ligue 1 outing of the new season this weekend against...,"PARIS: Kylian Mbappe will miss Paris St-Germain’s first Ligue 1 outing of the new season this weekend against Clermont Foot with an adductor injury, his club said on Friday.
PSG announced that Mbappe had been left out of the squad that would travel to Clermont for Saturday’s game  “due to pain in his adductor muscles” and will instead remain behind for treatment.
“A further update will be provided in 72 hours time.” Mbappe already missed PSG’s 4-0 win over Nantes in the French season-opening Champions Trophy in Tel-Aviv last weekend due to a suspension carried over from the last campaign.
PSG begin their defence of the Ligue 1 title with a new coach, Christophe Galtier having taken over from sacked Mauricio Pochettino.
Lionel Messi and Neymar, who both scored against Nantes, are in the squad along with new signings Vitinha, Hugo Ekitike and Nordi Mukiele.
However, there is no place for the Qatar-owned club’s most recent recruit, with Portuguese international Renato Sanches not featuring in the list of 21 players announced on Friday.
Galtier, who led Lille to the Ligue 1 title in 2021, said he was eager for the season to start.
“We do this job to compete and experience all the emotions,” Galtier admitted.

4,NZ edge Netherlands in first T20,VOORBURG (Netherlands): A blistering bowling attack saw New Zealand beat Netherlands by 16 runs in the Black Caps’...,"VOORBURG (Netherlands): A blistering bowling attack saw New Zealand beat Netherlands by 16 runs in the Black Caps’ penultimate T20 International match of their European tour on Thursday.
Winning the toss and opting to bat, Kiwi captain Mitchell Santner’s team battled to get going on a sluggish hybrid pitch at the scenic Voorburg Cricket Club.
Driven by a determined 45 off 36 balls by veteran batsman Martin Guptill and a late flurry of shots by Jimmy Neesham and Ish Sodhi, New Zealand scraped together 148 after 20 overs -- just enough to see them fend off a determined Dutch fightback in the second innings.
“It was probably a slow wicket, but we did well to scratch to 150,” Santner said after the match.
“The quickfire runs changed the momentum for us. Taking wickets during the powerplay was key.”
Paceman Blair Tickner ripped into the Dutch batting line-up, claiming the scalps of both openers, veteran Stephan Myburgh (5) and Max O’Dowd (2).
Tickner ended with figures of 4-27 in 3.3 overs, followed by Ben Sears who returned an impressive 3-22.
The Dutch staged a feisty fightback, led by rising star Bas de Leede, who hit a hard-charging 66 off 53 balls, including five fours and two sixes.
De Leede put on a 49-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Scott Edwards before the Dutch captain fell to a brilliant catch by Glenn Phillips off the bowling of Santner for 20.
Earlier, disciplined Dutch fielding and tight spin-bowling by the Netherlands restricted New Zealand to 148-7.
The Black Caps appeared well-set to pass 200 until Neesham was brilliantly caught by De Leede on the boundary off a full toss.
The Dutch, much improved from their performance in the field against England earlier in the season, remained sharp.
Their best bowler, the diminutive Shariz Ahmad caught and bowled a dangerous-looking Phillips (14) and ended with figures of 2-15 in three overs.
“The 148 definitely looked makeable,” Edwards lamented after the game.
“Bassie [De leede] was brilliant. But we were a little behind the eight-ball. It became a bit tricky,” he said.

The announcement marks a major blow to the Spaniard’s hopes of being fully fit for the US Open which begins in New York at the end of the month. 
“We have decided not to travel to Montreal and continue with the training sessions without forcing ourselves,” Nadal tweeted in Spanish. 
“I sincerely thank the tournament director, Eugene, and his entire team for the understanding and support they have always shown me, and today was no exception.” 
The 36-year-old has not played since pulling out of his Wimbledon semi-final with Nick Kyrgios after failing to recover from an abdominal tear he suffered in the quarters.
It was the latest in a lengthy series of injuries for Nadal who, in the absence of Novak Djokovic at Flushing Meadows, will be looking to add to his record 22 Grand Slam titles. Before his latest setback, he had already missed 11 Grand Slam events stretching back to his debut in 2003.

Galtier, appointed last month to replace Mauricio Pochettino, has seen the Ligue 1 champions already bring in another Portuguese international Vitinha, French defender Nordi Mukiele and striker Hugo Ekitike.
The latest new face at the Parc de Princes, Sanches, is reunited with Galtier having worked with him at Lille. The 24-year-old Euro 2016 winner has signed a deal extending to 2027, PSG announced in a statement.
After struggling to live up to his 35 million euros ($35.8m) price tag at Bayern Munich and after a loan spell at English Championship side Swansea City the player who started off his playing career at Benfica in his native Lisbon moved to Lille in 2019 to reignite his career.
And the move paid off handsomely as Sanches helped the northern French side claim an unexpected Ligue 1 title at the chief expense of his new club in 2021.
Galtier and the club’s fans will be hoping his precision passing will serve well PSG’s fearsome forward triumvirate of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar.`
Lille bade farewell to their star player, saying they had been  “happy to have helped his development and the progress of his career”.
Ahead of PSG’s first game of the new league season away to Clermont on Saturday, Galtier called for further reinforcements before the end of August.
“I want a certain number of players in my squad, players who are very similar in level, to perform well throughout the season and to create healthy competition,” he said at a news conference.
“But are these three players going to arrive quickly, later or not at all? I don’t know. I know the club is doing all it can to have a very competitive squad.”

8,England’s Brook and Jacks get Lions chance against South Africa,LONDON: Uncapped batters Harry Brook and Will Jacks will hope to impress after being named Friday in a 13-strong...,"LONDON: Uncapped batters Harry Brook and Will Jacks will hope to impress after being named Friday in a 13-strong England Lions squad for the national A side’s tour match against South Africa next week.
The four-day game at Canterbury will act as a warm-up for the Proteas ahead of the first Test against England at Lord’s starting on August 17.
Brook has been involved in senior England squads this season but the Yorkshireman has yet to make his full international red-ball debut for a team that have so far won all four of their Tests under a new management duo of captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum.
The 23-year-old Brook had already been included in England’s squad for the first two matches of a three-Test series against the Proteas.
Jacks, also 23, has helped Surrey climb to the top of the first-class County Championship table and, in an indication of his aggressive shot-making, went from 100 to 150 against Essex in just 16 balls.
There is a surprise call-up as well for Somerset’s 18 year-old wicketkeeper-batsman James Rew after just four first-class matches.
Rew, who made his debut last summer, missed the early part of the season as he was taking his A-Level school leaving exams. He came into the Somerset first team last month, hitting his maiden first-class century in the draw against Essex at Chelmsford.
Rew is unlikely to get into the side as a wicket-keeper as Sam Billings will captain the Lions on his Kent home ground.
England had previously confirmed that Ollie Robinson, recalled into the Test squad, would play for the Lions as the Sussex paceman bids to prove his fitness following a series of injuries that have prevented him from adding to a tally of nine caps since he faced Australia at Hobart in January.
England assistant coach Paul Collingwood will take charge of the Lions, with players leaving their Hundred and One-Day Cup squads in order to play in the representative fixture starting on August 9. 
“The squad strongly represents some of the country’s current, next best and future England players,” said England and Wales Cricket Board performance director Mo Bobat. 
“For some players, this game will be important preparation going into the Test series.” 
England Lions squad: Sam Billings (captain/wicket-keeper), Harry Brook, Sam Cook, Sam Conners, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Keaton Jennings, Dan Lawrence, Craig Overton, Liam Patterson-White, James Rew, Ollie Robinson, Dom Sibley.

9,Siegfried Aikman terms 7-0 rout ‘learning opportunity’ after Australia crush Pakistan’s semi-final hopes at CWG,Pakistan will now face Canada in a classification match for 7th-8th place.,"BIRMINGHAM: A day after the crushing 7-0 defeat at the hands of Australia, Pakistan coach Siegfried Aikman said it was a learning opportunity for his side. 
Australia put paid to Pakistan’s semi-final hopes at the Commonwealth Games on Thursday night with Jeremy Hayward and Tom Wickham twice each at the University of Birmingham ground. 
Pakistan, who went into their final Pool ‘A’ fixture needing to win by two goals to pip South Africa to second spot, will now face Canada in a classification match for 7th-8th place while Australia advanced to a last-four clash with hosts England. 
“Yesterday we had a great opponent in Australia the current number two of the world,” Aikman wrote in a short tweet on Friday. “Great challenge and learning opportunity. We wanted to play to win.” 
Pakistan, indeed, started as if they wanted to win and put Australia, who have won hockey gold in all six editions since the sport was introduced to the Commonwealth Games, under pressure. 
Pakistan were denied three times by Australian goalkeeper Andrew Charter, twice in rapid succession in general play then again from an ensuing penalty corner. 
But once Australia drew first blood through Blake Glovers in the 12th minute, there was no way back for Pakistan. 
Glovers obliged when presented with an open goal, Jake Whetton flirting with the baseline before his pass to Wickham was then slapped across the face to Govers. 
Hayward added another in the second quarter from a rifled, low-drag flick to put Pakistan’s finals dream further from reach and dim the parochial crowd in a city boasting a healthy Pakistan population. 
The University’s clock — the world’s tallest freestanding clock tower nicknamed Old Joe — chimed for 10pm in the background as Hayward scored his second. 
Two minutes later, Daniel Beale somehow controlled a ball while lying on the ground in the circle, swiping a pass to Wickham for his first. 
Wickham then cheekily found space inside the post to finish a superb solo run before Jacob Anderson and Nathan Ephraums completed the rout.

BIRMINGHAM: Two out of the three members of the Sri Lankan contingent who went missing from the Commonwealth Games village in Birmingham have been located by the British police, Sri Lankan sports authorities said on Thursday.
Sri Lanka’s National Olympic Committee Secretary General Maxwell De Silva told the Indo-Asian News Service that the British police had located two of the missing members but their details have not being revealed to Sri Lankan officials.
“In fact we had contacted the British High Commission but they would not tell anything,” he said.
A wrestler, a judoka, and a judo coach out of 161 strong contingent comprising athletes and coaching staff had reached Birmingham obtaining visas for nearly six months.
Following the disappearance of the three members, NOC officials have removed documents for all remaining members of the team currently at the games in Birmingham.
Sri Lankan officials had earlier told media that Birmingham police are on investigation on the disappearance of the three members.
The scandalous news was broke when Sri Lanka had won three medals, including the impressive achievement of Yupun Abeykoon, who won the bronze medal in the men’s 100m as the fastest man in South Asia and the only representation from the region for the most competitive event.
Facing the worst ever economic crisis since the independence in 1948, many Sri Lankans are attempting to migrate both legally and illegally. A large number of boats heading for Australia, New Zealand and even France have been taken into custody recently while a large number of Tamils from northern Sri Lanka had landed at India’s Rameswaram in fibre boats.

Broadbell, 21, dominated the final from the start to win in 13.08sec, making up for the disappointment of last year, when injury prevented him going to the Tokyo Olympics.
Fellow Jamaican Hansle Parchment, the Olympic champion, had withdrawn earlier in the day due to a niggle just as he had done before last month’s world championship final.
Heptathlon champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s boyfriend Andrew Pozzi won bronze.
“I knew I had to stay focused and that is what I did,” said Broadbell. “Sometimes, when you run, you don’t know what is going to happen. You just have to execute properly. I’m not sure if I clipped any hurdles.”
He said Parchment gave him a call to tell him he had withdrawn.
“I’m not sure what the problem was, but he’s an Olympic champion, so he knows best.”
Broadbell’s performance lit up a low-key evening athletics session in Birmingham, which was still a 30,000 sell-out.
LaQuan Nairn gave the Bahamas their first-ever men’s long jump gold, while Australia’s Matthew Denny won the discus.
Nairn won with a best leap of 8.08 metres, edging out Murali Sreeshankar of India on countback.
“I said in Eugene [at the world championships] that I wanted to come here and get a gold medal,” said 26-year-old Nairn. “To say that and do it is great.”
Sreeshankar gave India their first medal in the event since Suresh Babu won bronze in 1978.
“It feels good,” he said.  “This medal has been a long time coming. I have been waiting for a global medal for a very long time, but I kept missing out.”
Denny threw a best of 67.26 metres, with England’s Lawrence Okoye taking silver a decade after he reached the Olympic final in London before departing to play in the NFL with the San Francisco 49ers.
Grenada’s defending decathlon champion Lindon Victor is hanging on to his title by the slenderest of margins heading into Friday’s final five events.
He has a total of 4,327 points, just 85 ahead of Cedric Dubler of Australia.
“I’m actually ahead of my score from Eugene [world championships where he finished fifth] nine days ago. That is a good sign,” he said.
In the men’s individual cycling time trial, Australia’s two-time world champion Rohan Dennis won gold as former Tour de France winner Geraint Thomas took bronze despite a crash.
Dennis’s victory made it a double for Australia after Grace Brown won the women’s event.
Thomas’s hopes of adding time-trial gold to the road race title he won in 2014 were dashed when he fell early in the ride.
“Sometimes it’s bad luck, but today I’ll take it on the chin and say it was my fault,” said the 2018 Tour de France winner.
On the first night of diving at the Sandwell Aquatics Centre, England’s Jack Laugher, who won a gold medal in the 3m synchro at the 2016 Rio Olympics, won the men’s one-metre springboard England’s Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix triumphed in the women’s 10m platform competition, with Laugher’s girlfriend, Lois Toulson, taking silver.

13,Raducanu wins marathon to reach Washington quarters,WASHINGTON: Reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu of Britain advanced to the quarter-finals of the ATP and WTA...,"WASHINGTON: Reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu of Britain advanced to the quarter-finals of the ATP and WTA Washington Open, refusing to wilt Thursday after a marathon match in sweltering heat.
The English 19-year-old outlasted Colombia’s Camila Osorio 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4) after two hours and 50 minutes for a gritty victory in the WTA’s longest two-set main draw match of the year. 
“It has got to be one of the most physical matches I’ve ever played,” Raducanu said.  
“It was a pretty monumental effort to really get through that. 
“I’m just really pleased and proud of how I dug in when it really mattered. It just gives you a lot of confidence coming through a match like that. “Physically, I’m pretty pleased with how I held up in that match. Looking forward to going again.” 
In another round-of-16 fixture, Liudmila Samsonova rallied past Australian Ajla Tomljanovic 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 at the US Open tune-up.
It will be only Raducanu’s third quarter-final since her amazing Grand Slam title run last year at New York, having reached the last eight at Cluj-Napoca last October and Stuttgart in April.
She has yet to reach a semi-final since taking the trophy last September at Flushing Meadows. 
“Sometimes in your career you feel like everything is automatic, you can go for whatever shot you want and it’s going to land,” Raducanu said. “Those weeks don’t come by very often. I’ve just accepted I’m not going to feel like that every week.” 
Osorio trailed Raducanu 3-0 but broke back in a 13-minute seventh game and broke again to lead 5-4, then had three double faults serving for the first set, one on set point, and Raducanu broke back.
In the first tie-breaker, Osorio won five of six points, the last when Raducanu double faulted, to seize a 5-3 edge. But Raducanu won the next four points, the last three on forehand winners, to capture the set. 
“Mentally I’m really proud of how I’m doing right now,” Raducanu said.
In the second set, Raducanu broke with a forehand volley winner for a 2-1 lead but needed treatment for blisters on her left foot and Osario battled back to force a tie-breaker.
Raducanu took five of the final seven points for the triumph, the last on a service winner. 
“I most enjoy the challenge of continuously coming back and getting back up, getting yourself out of rock bottom a lot of times repetitively,” Raducanu said.  
“It’s a fun challenge and I’ve twisted my perception of it. I’m not viewing it as a negative thing anymore. 
“The reward that you feel after a win, knowing you’ve come through that, it means a lot more.” 
RAIN HALTS KYRGIOS
On the men’s side, Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios of Australia led US fourth seed Reilly Opelka 7-6 (7-1), 2-1 when evening rain wiped out play for the rest of the day.
Bulgarian fifth seed Grigor Dimitrov led American Sebastian Korda 6-4 when the storms began. Hometown hero and 10th seed Frances Tiafoe and eighth seed Botic van de Zandschulp were level, the Dutchman winning the first set 6-4 and Tiafoe taking the second 6-2, when play was halted.
Top seed Andrey Rublev’s third-round match against US 13th seed Maxime Cressy and Danish ninth seed Holger Rune’s match against US wildcard J.J. Wolf were delayed to Friday with the winners meeting in a later afternoon quarter-final.
British 16th seed Daniel Evans advanced to the last eight when US third seed Taylor Fritz retired with the Englishman leading 3-6, 7-6 (8-6), 4-1.
Next up for Evans is world number 96 Yoshihito Nishioka of Japan, who edged seventh seed Karen Khachanov 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-1).
Nishioka is 4-0 all-time against Evans, including a 2019 first-round win at Washington, a 2020 Australian Open second-round victory and a win at Miami in March.
