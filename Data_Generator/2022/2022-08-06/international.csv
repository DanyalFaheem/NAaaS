0,Gandhis protest ‘death of democracy’ in India; Priyanka detained,"Congress leaders observe August 5, but stay subdued on annexation of disputed Jammu and Kashmir.","NEW DELHI: Congress leaders led by Priyanka Gandhi were detained here on Friday as they observed August 5 to mark the “death of democracy” in India.
Staying subdued about the annexation of disputed Jammu and Kashmir on this day in 2019, which the party opposed, and the stone-laying ceremony for the proposed temple at the site of the razed Babri Masjid later, to which it offered mixed response, the Congress focused instead on inflation, unfair trade taxes and authoritarian measures used to crush the protests.
Anybody who raised people’s issues and stood up against the “onset of dictatorship is viciously attacked and put in jail”, Rahul Gandhi said.
The issue also forced adjournments in both houses of parliament as Congress members registered their protest.
Wearing black clothes to protest against inflation and unemployment, Congress leaders hit the streets and were engaged in dramatic stand-offs with the police personnel outside the Parliament complex and the All India Congress Committee (AICC) headquarters.
Top leaders, including Mr Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, general secretaries K.C. Venugopal, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were detained by the police.
There were dramatic moments outside the AICC headquarters as Ms Vadra climbed over a barricade and sat on protest.
In parliament, after forcing both the houses to be adjourned, Congress members, including party chief Sonia Gandhi, assembled at Gate number 1 before attempting to march towards the Rashtrapati Bhavan. The Congress MPs were, however, stopped by the Delhi Police close to Vijay Chowk lawns and were not allowed to proceed towards the Rashtrapati Bhavan.
Ms Gandhi, who along with other women MPs was holding a banner, didn’t take part in the march. The other MPs were detained by the police at Vijay Chowk. 
Former Union Minister P. Chidam­baram, Manish Tewari, other Lok Sabha members Manickam Tagore and Gaurav Gogoi were among the 64 MPs who were taken away in a police bus to the Kingsway Camp police lines, The Hindu said.
“We are here to raise the issue of price rise,” Mr Gandhi said just before his arrest and added: “Democracy is being murdered”.
Alleging that his parliamentary colleagues were being manhandled, Mr Gandhi posted pictures of Dean Kuriakose being forcibly taken away and Mr Venugopal and Mr Chowdhury resisting police action by lying on the road. Videos released by the party showed the Congress leader trying to rescue his colleague, Deepender Hooda, who was being dragged by the police personnel.

1,South Korea launches first lunar orbiter,Orbiter Danuri was on a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida by Elon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX.,"SEOUL: South Korea’s first lunar orbiter successfully launched on a year-long mission to observe the Moon, Seoul said on Friday, with the payload including a new disruption-tolerant network for sending data from space.
Danuri — a portmanteau of the Korean words for  “Moon” and “enjoy” — was on a Falcon 9 rocket launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida by Elon Musk’s aerospace company SpaceX. It aims to reach the Moon by mid-December.
Danuri “successfully entered orbit towards the moon”, Seoul’s vice science minister Oh Tae-seok told reporters later on Friday, saying that researchers were already communicating with Danuri through Nasa’s deep-space antenna in Canberra, Australia.
“Analysis of the received satellite information confirmed that Danuri’s solar panel was properly unfolded to start power generation,” he said, adding everything appeared to be going smoothly.
Danuri will use six different instruments, including a highly sensitive camera provided by Nasa, to conduct research, including investigating the lunar surface to identify potential landing sites.
One of the instruments will evaluate disruption-tolerant, network-based space communications, which, according to South Korea’s science ministry, is a world first.
Danuri will also try to develop a wireless internet environment to link satellites or exploration spacecraft, Seoul has said.
The lunar orbiter will stream K-pop sensation BTS song  “Dynamite” to test this wireless network.
Scientists also hope Danuri will find hidden sources of water and ice in areas of the Moon, including the permanently dark and cold regions near the poles.

2,Thousands of Iraqis pray in Green Zone after Moqtada Sadr’s call,Sadr has for months been in a political standoff with a rival Shia alliance backed by Iran.,"BAGHDAD: Tens of thousands attended Friday prayers in Baghdad’s Green Zone in a new power play by Iraqi cleric Moqtada Sadr after his adversaries conditionally backed his call for early elections.
Sadr, a longtime political and religious force in Iraq, has for months been in a political standoff with a rival Shia alliance backed by Iran.
Worshippers converged on a vast square inside the normally secure Green Zone, home to government and diplomatic buildings, including the parliament which his followers began occupying on July 30.
“Yes, yes to reform,” Sadr’s followers chanted during the prayers. “No, no to corruption.” 
After the prayers, hundreds returned to the vicinity of parliament, whose air-conditioned halls and marble floors they had occupied since last Saturday.
Finding the doors locked and the building empty, they continued their sit-in among the gardens of the complex, according to a request from their movement. Mixed signals emerged on Tuesday from the Sadr camp for the inside of parliament to be cleared.
Sadr’s mass prayer rally follows his demand for early elections — a possibility that the rival bloc says it is conditionally open to, despite the last national polls only taking place about 10 months ago.
Since then, post-election negotiations between Sadr’s bloc — the largest in parliament — and other factions have failed to produce a new government, prime minister and president.
‘Prisoner of the corrupt’ 
The political tensions come as Iraq remains beset by rampant corruption, crumbling infrastructure and unemployment.
As a result of past deals, the Sadrists also have representatives at the highest levels of ministries and have been accused by opponents of being as corrupt as other political forces.
Supporters of Sadr, however, are ready to follow him almost blindly and view him as a champion of the anti-corruption fight.
Speaking at a lectern, the imam who led the prayer endorsed Sadr’s call for early elections.
“Iraq is a prisoner of the corrupt,” the imam said, denouncing “the scandalous deterioration of public services, health and education”.
Sheikh Ali al Atabi, 38, joined the throng to support Sadr. Calling people to Friday prayers is “part of his repertoire” when he “wants to use the people for something”, Atabi explained.
A similar prayer call and pressure tactic from Moqtada Sadr in mid-July drew hundreds of thousands of  worshippers to Sadr City, a Baghdad district named after his assassinated father.
Qassem Abu Mustafa, 40, described the latest gathering as “a thorn” jabbing “the enemy to demand legislative elections and reforms”.
The faithful, mostly men but with some women, used umbrellas to protect themselves from Baghdad’s 42 degrees Celsius heat.
Some waved Iraqi flags and carried portraits of their leader.
“Whatever Mr Sadr’s opinion, we are with him,” said Abu Mustafa, a civil servant.
Devoted following 
Sadr’s bloc emerged from the October elections as parliament’s biggest, but still far short of a majority.
In June, his 73 lawmakers quit in a bid to break the logjam. That led to a rival Shia bloc, the pro-Iran Coordination Framework, becoming the largest in the legislature.
The Coordination Frame­work’s nomination of former minister Mohammed Shia al Sudani as prime minister angered the Sadr bloc and triggered the occupation of parliament by his supporters.

3,"Lenders could delay Lanka bailout, warns president",Crucial debt restructuring is a pre-condition before the IMF will approve a bailout for the country.,"COLOMBO: A potential Inter­national Monetary Fund bailout for Sri Lanka could be delayed if its creditors — the largest being China — do not agree on concessions, the country’s president warned on Friday.
A crucial debt restructuring — with the countries to which it owes billions agreeing to write off some of their dues — is a pre-condition before the IMF will approve a bailout for the country, where inflation is rampant and shortages of essentials widespread.
“Until you come to an agreement among the official creditors, it is not possible to go to the London Club,” Ranil Wickremesinghe told a forum, referring to subsequent debt talks with commercial lenders.
President Wickremesinghe did not name a single country, but analysts said he was referring to China, the largest single bilateral creditor, which is owed over 10 percent of Sri Lanka’s foreign debt.
Officials say that clinching an agreement with Beijing is crucial, but China has not publicly shifted from its offer of more loans rather than taking a haircut on existing credit.
The IMF is likely to insist on painful reforms as part of any bailout, and Wickremesinghe warned: “It may be bitter, but any medicine for recovery is bitter. You have to take injections.” 
Previous presidents, including his immediate predecessor who fled abroad and resigned last month, borrowed heavily from Beijing for infrastructure projects, most of which became white elephants.
Analyst Victor Ivan said debt talks could be leveraged by Beijing to extract concessions in the South Asian country, which has become a geopolitical hotspot.
Unable to pay back a $1.4 billion loan, Colombo handed a Chinese-funded and — built deep sea port to a Beijing company in 2017 on a 99-year lease.
“China has done it in the past, but to do it so openly now could backfire on them due to Sri Lanka’s circumstances,” Ivan said.
Beijing has publicly offered Colombo more loans to pay off its debt to China, a move that is not acceptable to other creditors who want all lenders treated equally.
“Renegotiating the Chinese debt could be a sticking point,” former Central Bank of Sri Lanka deputy governor W. A. Wijewardena said. “There will have to be hard bargaining with them.” 
The US appeared to nudge Sri Lanka’s creditors to cut a deal on their debts.
On the sidelines of an Asean meeting on Thursday, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said an IMF bailout “requires appropriate debt restructuring that has to be done on an equitable basis with all of the creditors doing what’s necessary”.
Sri Lanka defaulted on its $51 billion foreign debt in mid-April and sought talks with the IMF.
The country has also borrowed heavily from India this year to battle fuel shortage. Delhi is yet to declare its stance on restructuring.

4,Musk accuses Twitter of fraud in court,Alleges social media platform misled him about key aspects of its business before he agreed to $44bn buyout.,"SAN FRANCISCO: Elon Musk has accused Twitter of fraud, alleging the social media platform misled him about key aspects of its business before he agreed to a $44 billion buyout, as their court battle heats up.
The Tesla boss lodged the claim late on Thursday as he fights back against Twitter’s lawsuit seeking to force him to close the deal, which he has tried to cancel.
Musk argued in the filing to a Delaware court that the number of users who can be shown advertising on the platform is far below the firm’s figures.
“Twitter’s disclosures have slowly unravelled, with Twitter frantically closing the gates on information in a desperate bid to prevent the Musk Parties from uncovering its fraud,” the claim alleged.
In its own filing, Twitter rejected the mercurial billionaire’s argument, calling it “as implausible and contrary to fact as it sounds”.  
“According to Musk, he — the billionaire founder of multiple companies, advised by Wall Street bankers and lawyers — was hoodwinked by Twitter into signing a $44 billion merger agreement,” Twitter said.
Musk last week filed his countersuit, which was finally made public on Thursday, along with a legal defence against Twitter’s claim that the billionaire is contractually bound to complete the takeover deal.
‘Distortion, misrepresentation’ 
“The counterclaims are a made-for-litigation tale that is contradicted by the evidence and common sense,” Twitter argued in the filing.
A five-day trial that will consider Twitter’s lawsuit against Musk has been scheduled for Oct 17.
The Tesla boss wooed Twitter’s board with a $54.20 per-share offer, but then announced last month he was ending their agreement because the firm had misled him regarding its tally of fake and spam accounts.
Twitter, whose stock price closed at $41.06 on Thursday, has stuck by its estimates that less than five percent of the activity on the platform is due to software “bots” rather than people.
Twitter told the court Musk’s claim that the false account figure tops 10 percent is “untenable”. The company also disputed Musk’s assertion that he has the right to walk away from the deal if Twitter’s bot count is found to be wrong, since he didn’t ask anything about bots when he made the buyout offer.
Twitter accuses Musk of contriving a story to escape a merger agreement that he no longer found attractive.
“Twitter has complied in every respect with the merger agreement,” the company said in the filing made to a court in the state of Delaware.
“Musk’s counter-claims, based as they are on distortion, misrepresentation, and outright deception, change nothing.” 
The social media platform has urged shareholders to endorse the deal, setting a vote on the merger for Sept 13.
Billions of dollars are at stake, but so is the future of Twitter, which Musk has said should allow any legal speech — an absolutist position that has sparked fears the network could be used to incite violence.

5,Hindu hardliners call for boycott of Aamir’s Gump remake,"NEW DELHI: According to Forrest Gump, life is like a box of chocolates because “you never know what you’re going...","NEW DELHI: According to Forrest Gump, life is like a box of chocolates because “you never know what you’re going to get”. Now, an Indian remake of the movie has been hit by boycott calls over years-old comments by Aamir Khan. It is the latest example of how Bollywood actors, particularly Muslims like Khan, are feeling increased pressure under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The Indian movie, Laal Singh Chaddha, a spin on the 1994 Hollywood hit with Tom Hanks, is expected to be one of India’s biggest films this year.
This is due in large part to its main star, 57-year-old Aamir Khan, one of the Indian industry’s most bankable actors with past blockbusters like Three Idiots (2009) and Dangal (2016).
But ahead of the Aug 11 release, the internet is awash with clips from a 2015 interview when Khan expressed a growing “sense of fear” and that he and his then-wife discussed leaving India.
“She fears for her child. She fears about what the atmosphere around us will be. She feels scared to open the newspapers every day,” he said.
More than 200,000 tweets, many from supporters of Modi’s BJP, have been shared since last month calling for people to spurn the movie with the hashtag #BoycottLaalSinghChaddha.
“Aamir Khan married two Hindu Women, yet named his kids Junaid, Azad & Ira. (Hindu co-star) Kareena (Kapoor) married a Muslim & promptly named her kids Taimur & Jehangir,” said one tweet, referring to the children’s typical Muslim names.
“That’s enough reasons to boycott Lal Singh Chaddha, basically a production from Bollywood’s Love Jihad club. #BoycottLaalSinghChaddha,” it added, using a derogatory term coined by Hindu extremists who accuse Muslim men of marrying Hindu women and forcing them to convert.
Patriotism 
Nicknamed “Mr Perfectionist”, Aamir Khan has been credited with pushing films beyond Bollywood’s traditional fare of song and dance into social and cultural issues.
He also hosted a TV chat show — Satyamev Jayate — that discussed touchy themes like rape, domestic violence and corruption.
The furore over his new film — which adapts the famous line by Hanks to say that “life is like a golgappa” — is such that this week Khan stressed his patriotism, a key tenet of the Modi government.
“I feel sad that some of the people... believe that I am someone who doesn’t like India,” he told local media.
“That’s not the case. Please don’t boycott my film. Please watch my film.” 
Intolerance 
Films have long sparked controversy — as well as violence — in India.
But the heat being felt by Khan, one of a clutch of Muslim megastars in the industry along with Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, mirrors growing intolerance, marginalisation and vilification of the community, commentators say.
“There is no doubt that Aamir is being targeted by those spreading hatred towards Muslims,” one commentator said.
Hindu hegemony 
Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) owes its origins to Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a militaristic group espousing Hindutva, or making India an exclusively Hindu state.
Lynching of Muslims by Hindu mobs over so-called cow protection and other hate crimes have sown fear in the 200- million-strong Muslim population.
Social media is full of misinformation claiming that Muslims will soon outnumber Hindus — due to inter-religious marriages — or that the minority is a treasonous fifth column backed by Pakistan.
Gung-ho 
Critics say that the world’s most prolific film industry and its stars have been gradually changing their output to fit the government narrative since Modi came to power in 2014.
In 2019, the hagiographic “PM Narendra Modi” was too much even for the election watchdog, which delayed its release until after a vote that year.
There has been a recent string of military-themed movies that have been nationalistic, all-guns-blazing stories of heroics by soldiers and police — usually Hindus — against enemies outside and within India.

6,"Chinese, Russian FMs boycott Japanese minister’s speech",Asian leaders gather to discuss efforts to end the crisis in Myanmar.,"PHONM PENH: Tensions over developments around Taiwan spilled into an Asian meeting of foreign ministers on Friday, diverting attention at a gathering that had been expected to focus on efforts to end the crisis in Myanmar.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov walked out of a plenary session just as Japan’s top diplomat, Yoshimasa Hayashi, spoke.
Wang called a rare news conference later, where he accused Blinken of spreading misinformation.
He called Pelosi’s trip a “contemptible farce” and stressed China’s military response to it was “firm, forceful and appropriate”, and handled professionally.
Asked about his walkout, Wang suggested Hayashi may have had a guilty conscience.
“If the Japanese side has some concern about this, then I am afraid the Japanese side should think about whether they have done something very wrong to China,” he said.
“If you have not done anything wrong to China, why are you worried about this?”  
Hayashi said he noticed Wang and Lavrov leaving as he spoke.
“In times like this, when the situation is tense, communicating well is important. Japan is always open to dialogue with China,” Hayashi told reporters.
The 10-member Asean issued a communique on Friday that made no mention of Taiwan, but stressed its disappointment at the limited progress made by Myanmar’s military rulers in implementing an Asean-led peace agreement.
Southeast Asia’s Asean Regional Forum included officials from the United States, China, Russia and Japan, but it ended with no new agreements announced and closing statements deferred until Saturday, as Beijing and Washington traded barbs over the Pelosi visit.
Foreign ministers of more than 20 countries joined closed-door roundtable talks in Cambodia as China carried out large-scale military drills, including the launching of live missiles around Taiwan, in response to Pelosi’s trip.
She was the highest-level US visitor in 25 years to the self-governed island, which China regards as its sovereign territory.
“There is no justification for this extreme, disproportionate and escalatory military response,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told a news conference on the sidelines of the Phnom Penh gathering.
“Now, they’ve taken dangerous acts to a new level,” he said, emphasising Washin­gton would not provoke a crisis and would support regional allies.
