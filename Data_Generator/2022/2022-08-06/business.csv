0,SBP reverses cash margins on imports,Cash margins reversed from 100pc to 25pc and in some cases to zero; SBP says moved aimed at providing relief to importers.,"KARACHI:  The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday reversed the cash margins on  imports from 100 per cent to 25pc and in some cases to zero, showing  the strength of confidence of the policymakers hoping for a better  outcome of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and  friendly countries.
“To  provide relief to importers, the SBP has significantly reduced cash  margin requirements on deferred payments. Cash margin will be 25pc for  payments from 91 to 180 days and 0pc for payments beyond 180 days  instead of the previous requirement of 100pc,” the SBP said.
On  April 8, the SBP imposed a 100pc cash margin on imports to  discourage them, which drastically hit the external account of the  economy amid a ballooning import bill. The central bank  imposed 100pc cash margins on 177 items to reduce imports, easing  pressure on the rupee and narrowing trade and current account deficits.
According  to the April circular, banks must obtain a 100pc cash margin on all  items imported immediately. The cash margins on these specific items  will remain in place until the end of this year.
The current government, which  just a few days ago was facing a serious threat of a country’s default  on external payments, took the daring step of reducing the cash margin  to the lowest level.
The fiscal year FY22 ended on June 30 and  recorded a total import bill of goods and services of $84 billion, with a  trade deficit of about $48bn and a current account deficit of $17.4bn.
The huge import bill was held responsible for the current account deficit, which pushed the country close to default level.
However, the situation has yet to change as the country has yet to receive a single dollar from the IMF or friendly countries.
The  claims of the finance minister played a key role in bringing down the  dollar value in the currency market, and the speculative part of the  exchange rate vanished in a single session as the dollar lost over Rs9  two days ago.
The exchange rate is in favour of the rupee, but the  local currency is recovering slowly compared to the massive loss against  the US dollar during FY22 and the over 13pc devaluation of the rupee in  July alone.
The rupee recovered about 4.2pc against the US dollar  over the last six sessions; it was a good performance, but it still  relies on promises sold by the finance minister.
However, a 47pc drop  in the trade deficit in July encouraged both the rupee and policymakers  to allow imports with the lowest cash margins.
When a 100pc cash  margin was introduced in April, the import bill for July-March 2021-22  (9MFY22) rose by 49pc to $58.7bn. Since January 2022, the currency has  depreciated by 6.2pc due to the widening current account gap. In 9MFY22,  it fell by 16.28pc.
Analysts and economists suggest that there must  be a balance in trade, but imports are a complex subject in Pakistan.  Exporters are also in favour of imports as they use over 30pc of  imported constituents for their exportable goods. The government fears  that with a slash in imports, exports will also decline; the government  does not want to see exports fall.
According to the SBP circular, the cash margin requirements will apply to the PKR equivalent amount of the import transaction.
“It  may be noted that the above instructions shall apply to all new import  transactions initiated by the bank after the issuance date of this  circular letter,” said the SBP circular. “However, on already initiated  import transactions, the instructions may only be applied if the  amendments (in terms of payment) are made subsequent to the date of the  issuance of the instructions,” the circular said. The cash margins  deposited by importers on all items would be non-remunerative, it added.

1,ECC fixes import price for Russian wheat at $390 a tonne,Asks TCP to cancel tender if Moscow refuses to accept offer.,"ISLAMABAD: Amid falling international wheat prices, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet has decided to link the opening of tender for the import of wheat from Russia with a lower price of $390 per tonne.
The ECC meeting chaired by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Friday decided that the Russian side may be offered the price of $390 per tonne and the tender may be scrapped if they do not accept the offer. It was observed in the meeting that there is a declining trend in the price of wheat which may further drop in the coming days.

On May 28, the ECC decided to import 2m tonnes of wheat on a government-to-government (G2G) basis, while 1m tonnes through an international tendering process under the existing arrangement to pre-empt shortage and rising prices.

Asks TCP to cancel tender if Moscow refuses to accept offer

In this regard, the Ministry of National Food Security and Research submitted a summary on the supply of milling wheat from Russia on G2G basis. 
In compliance with the ECC decision regarding the import of 3 million tonnes of wheat, the Trading Corporation of Pakistan initiated the process of import of wheat from the Russian government.
In this context, an MoU was signed between a Russian state-owned enterprise (SOE) and TCP on June 8. Initially, the government of Russia offered a wheat price of $410 per tonne.
The Prime Minister’s Office has constituted a committee under Adviser to the PM on Foreign Affairs Tariq Fatemi to negotiate with the Islamabad-based Russian Embassy on the price issue of imported wheat. 
Meanwhile, the Russian delegation met with the Minister for Commerce Naveed Qamar and offered a reduced price of wheat at the rate of $405 per tonne. 
Later on, the price was further reduced to $400 per tonne.
The Ministry of Food Security on the recommendations of the commerce ministry submitted the price offered by M/s Prodintorg, a state-owned company of the government of Russia at the rate of $399.50 per tonne for a supply of 120,000 tonnes for the consideration of the ECC.

3,Facebook’s Meta plans first-ever bonds to beat future uncertainties,"Its filing does not indicate the amount of funds it wants to raise, nor the term of the bonds.","SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook-owner Meta is ending a run as one of the few major firms without debt, launching its first bond sale as the company battles uncertainty and bets heavily on its metaverse vision.
Worries over the social media giant’s future and fierce competition from TikTok have sent its stock plummeting, while the firm spends billions on its plan for the internet’s next iteration.
Meta reported to the US markets watchdog on Thursday that it has begun offering bonds to raise money for uses such as  “capital expenditures, repurchases of outstanding shares of its common stock, acquisitions, or investments.” The firm, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment beyond its filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Its filing does not indicate the amount of funds it wants to raise, nor the term of the bonds, but Bloomberg news agency reported Meta may sell $8-10 billion in debt.
Last week, Meta reported its first year-on-year drop in quarterly revenue, and its net profit dropped 36 per cent to $6.7bn.
The firm, which relies almost exclusively on advertising revenue, has been hit by a decline in advertisers’ spending driven in part by economic uncertainty and TikTok’s rise.
“I’d say that the situation seems worse than it did a quarter ago,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg told analysts after disappointing results last week.
Some analysts said the company, which rebranded itself last year, should have taken on debt long ago.
“Meta has no debt on its balance sheet unlike other big technology players and the company will aggressively build out its metaverse strategy and that take a lot of capital,” said analyst Dan Ives.

4,Global rice exports at risk amid harsh weather,"SINGAPORE: Adverse weather across top rice suppliers in Asia, including the biggest exporter India, is threatening ...","SINGAPORE: Adverse weather across top rice suppliers in Asia, including the biggest exporter India, is threatening to reduce the output of the world’s most important food staple and stoke food inflation that is already near record highs.
Rice has bucked the trend of rising food prices amid bumper crops and large inventories at exporters over the past two years, even as Covid-19, supply disruptions and more recently the Russia-Ukraine conflict made other grains costlier.
But inclement weather in exporting countries in Asia, which accounts for about 90 per cent of the world’s rice output, is likely to change the price trajectory, traders and analysts said.
“There is an upside potential for rice prices with the possibility of production downgrades in key exporting countries,” said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness economist at National Australia Bank.
“An increase in rice prices would add to already major challenges for food affordability in parts of the developing world,” Ziebell told Reuters.
Patchy rains in India’s grain belt, a heatwave in China, floods in Bangladesh and quality downgrades in Vietnam could curb yields in four of the world’s top five rice producers, farmers, traders and analysts told Reuters.
“Rice has remained accessible even as overall food prices reached record levels earlier this year,” said U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organisation economist, Shirley Mustafa.
“We are now witnessing weather-related setbacks in some key rice producing countries, including India, China and Bangladesh, which could result in lower output if conditions don’t improve in the next few weeks,” Mustafa added.
‘Production drop is certain’
India’s top rice producing states of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh have recorded a monsoon rainfall deficit of as much as 45pc so far this season, data from the state-run weather department shows.
That has in part led to a 13pc drop in rice planting this year, which could result in production falling by 10 million tonnes or around 8% from last year, said B.V. Krishna Rao, president of the All India Rice Exporters Association.
The area under rice cultivation is down also because some farmers shifted to pulses and oilseeds, Rao said.
India’s summer-sown rice accounts for more than 85pc of its annual production, which jumped to a record 129.66 million tonnes in the crop year to June 2022.
“A production drop is certain, but the big question is how the government will react,” a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm said.
Milled and paddy rice stocks in India as of July 1 totalled 55 million tonnes, versus the target of 13.54 million tonnes.
That has kept rice prices down in the past year together with India’s record 21.5 million tonnes shipment in 2021, which was more than the total shipped by the world’s next four biggest exporters - Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan and the United States.
“But the government is hypersensitive about prices. A small rise could prompt it to impose export curbs,” the trader said.
In Vietnam, rains during harvest have damaged grain quality.
“Never before have I seen it rain that much during harvest. It’s just abnormal,” said Tran Cong Dang, a 50-year-old farmer based in the Mekong Delta province of Bac Lieu.
“In just ten days, the total measured rain is somewhat equal to the whole of previous month,” said Dang, who estimated a 70pc output loss on his 2-hectare paddy field due to floods.

Taking to the social media platform Twitter, GSMA Head of Asia Pacific Julian Gorman shared a news report on Jazz’s revenue and said, “Outstanding results but alarming for sustainability of the mobile industry and further network investment. Achieving the digital Pakistan vision demands immediate fiscal policy intervention such as spectrum licence extensions.” 
In a tweet to Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, PBC said: “Internet and cellular connectivity are essential for promoting financial inclusivity and formalisation of the economy. We urge the govt to adopt policies conducive to long-term growth of the country through affordable, reliable and widely available connectivity.”
Meanwhile, the telecom sector has written a letter to the Ministry of Information and Technology and Telecommunication that an unannounced “digital emergency” has been declared in the country’s telecom sector, and many areas were even facing connectivity load-shedding recently due to prolonged power outages, and the companies were unable to operate towers at full capacity for a long period due to high fuel cost.
The letter referred to the GSMA research report that stated the average revenue per user (ARPU) was very low in Pakistan and the country was ranked at 233 out of a total of 238 nations in ARPU.
“It is estimated that the four telcos had a net profit of $188 million in 2021, but if major regulatory changes are not made, the total loss of the sector could be around $287m by the end of 2023,” said a senior executive of a telecom company.
