Cases were also registered against 43 people.
Talking to reporters on Friday, Deputy District Officer Health Dr Sara Qadeer said due to the looming threat of dengue fever outbreak in Taxila and Wah, the health authorities had expedited anti-dengue surveillance to trace larvae and eradicate them.
She said during the drive, dengue larvae were found in 125 commercial areas, especially junkyard, tyre shops and block factories. As a result, fine amounting to Rs118,000 was imposed on the owners for failing to follow the standard operating procedures (SOPs).

Sprays carried out in vulnerable areas; third party audit of anti-dengue teams to be conducted to ensure transparency

She said the current rain spell coupled with hot weather had increased the chances of dengue outbreak, therefore the situation needed to be handled on an urgent basis as the Met Office had forecast more rain in the coming days.
She said larvae were detected in 1,080 houses in various localities, following which the indoor residual spray was carried out in 4,671 residences in the area.
Responding to a question, Dr Sara Qadeer said so far two suspected patients were under treatment and no confirmed case had emerged.
The health officer said since community participation and awareness was a must to minimise the threat of dengue spread, awareness seminars and walks were held by the health department in the hot spots, especially wards 2, 6, 7 and 8 of Wah Cantt and union councils Saray Kala and Mohra Shah Wali Shah Ward 1 in Taxila in July and August.
She further said fogging was carried out on a daily basis with the collaboration of other civic bodies, especially the cantonment board and municipal committee in Wah and Taxila.
On the other hand, Deputy Commissioner Attock Mohammad Zulqurnain said third party audit of anti-dengue teams would be carried out to ensure transparency and detect bogus activities. He expressed these views while reviewing the activities conducted by the teams during his field visit in Attock on Friday.
He said as bogus activities were detected by the anti-dengue patrols in various parts of the province, the district administration would ensure foolproof measures to control dengue in all six tehsils of the district through the third party audit.
He directed the anti-dengue patrols to expedite their surveillance to trace larvae and eradicate them, calling upon residents to keep an eye on junkyards, schools and under-construction buildings and remove water after rain to eliminate breeding spots of dengue mosquitoes.
The deputy commissioner directed the officials to ensure full implementation of anti-dengue regulations and warned that stern action would be taken against those failing to comply with the rules.

3,"Pakistan has potential to generate energy, say experts",ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has unmatched potential for power generation through renewable resources like wind and solar...,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has unmatched potential for power generation through renewable resources like wind and solar energy.
This was stated by experts at a workshop organised by the Ministry of Climate Change in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF-Pakistan) on Friday to launch the ‘Preparation of Pakistan’s Third National Communication (TNC)’ under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
During his opening statement, WWF-Pakistan Director General Hammad Naqi Khan said: “In the last few months alone, we have witnessed heat waves, forest fires, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) and altered rainfall patterns – all manifestations of climate change.”
He said it was important that this exercise was done to revisit policies and strategies, identify gaps and try to plug them to mitigate and adapt to the present realities.
Representatives from the main implementing partners, including Global Change Impact Study Centre, National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority, Pakistan Council for Renewable Energy Technologies and WWF-Pakistan gave an overview of their planned activities under seven thematic working groups of the TNC.
Additional Secretary, Ministry of Climate Change, Joudat Ayaz said if steps were not taken to control climate change, Pakistan’s coastline would be somewhere between Karachi and Hyderabad by 2100, resulting in environmental crises and massive internal migration.
He said Pakistan had the potential to produce 40,000 megawatts (MWs) of wind energy at Gharo Sindh.
Wind alone can meet the energy needs whereas solar power alone has the potential to generate 30,000 MWs, he said, adding that at present only 2 to 3pc of the energy came from these sources.
“Till about a decade ago, it was thought that environmentally-sustainable policies and actions were a priority for rich countries. But it is equally important for developing countries,” Mr Ayaz added.
Mohammad Farooq, joint secretary (development) at the ministry, said: “Mitigation and adaptation remain top challenges for us. While we are addressing the mitigation side through a number of projects, we need to work on adaptation, specifically at the provincial and local levels where people in the lowest strata of society are suffering the consequences of climate change.”

The cabinet meeting was presided over by Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas. 
Briefing journalists, PM’s adviser for information Chaudhry Rafique Nayyar and finance minister Abdul Majid Khan said the cabinet had expressed sorrow over the loss of lives and property in recent rain-related incidents and had directed all deputy commissioners to compile cases for the payment of compensation to the victims’ families.
Besides, the cabinet had given its nod to four pieces of law – the Board of Investment Act to promote investment in the state, Power Crushers Act to bring the crushing plants largely blamed for environmental pollution under some regulations, Prevention of Trafficking of Persons Act and Registration Act.
In order to make the process of inductions in government service transparent, the cabinet had constituted a committee under the chief secretary to refine the Third Party Recruitment Act, they said.
They said proposed expenditures for the establishment of Teacher Learning Academy, Elementary and Secondary Boards and upgradation of 300 institutions were also sanctioned.
The finance minister regretted that the federal government was “evading implementation of a written agreement with AJK regarding increase in the emoluments of AJK employees on the pattern of their counterparts in Pakistan.”
He said he had made an announcement to this effect in his budget speech only after holding a meeting with the Pakistani PM’s adviser Qamar Zaman Kaira on this issue and obtaining a written approval from the secretary (Kashmir affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Division).

5,India failed to suppress Kashmiris’ legitimate struggle: AJK president,"Says after August 5, the BJP intensified efforts to change the region’s demography...","ISLAMABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry on Friday said that despite its jackboot tactics, India had miserably failed to suppress the Kashmiris’ spirit and their legitimate struggle for right to self-determination.
Addressing a press conference, President Chaudhry termed the August 5 move by India an atrocious assault on the Kashmiris’ ethno-cultural identity. 
AJK ministers Chaudhry Akhlaq and Chaudhry Maqbool were also present on the occasion. The Azad Kashmir president said the Indian motive behind this move was to put an end to the dispute but it had miserably failed in its designs.
“Today the Kashmir issue has more resonance at the international level compared to what it had before August 5,” he said.

Says after August 5, the BJP intensified efforts to change the region’s demography

Highlighting the dangerous designs of India’s BJP government, Mr Chaudhry said the situation in the held territory had deteriorated after India revoked Article 370 and 35A of the Indian constitution.
“After August 5, the BJP has intensified its efforts to change the region’s demography,” he said, adding that since then the occupation authorities had issued more than 240,000 fake domiciles to non-Kashmiris.
Referring to the political and administrative machinations of the Modi government, he said the BJP wanted to install a Hindu chief minister in occupied Kashmir by changing the electoral map of the region.
Regarding the ruthless suppression of dissent in the valley, the AJK president said suppression of democratic dissent over the past three years had led to arbitrary arrests and detention of Kashmiri leaders and workers.
“A number of Kashmiris, including the top rank Hurriyat leaders, have been arrested and left to rot in jails away from their homeland,” he said.
Voicing his concern over the continued bloodshed and violence in India-held Kashmir, Barrister Chaudhry said there was a dire need to sensitise the international community about the early and amicable solution to the dispute.
He said he held a series of demonstrations within and outside the country including the United Kingdom and Brussels, to draw the attention of the world towards the serious situation in the occupied territory.
On moving the International Court of Justice (ICJ) over Kashmir, the president said: “Only a member country of the forum can raise the issue at the ICJ”.
“I request the government of Pakistan to move the ICJ for the release of Yasin Malik and the serioushuman rights violations being committed by the Indian forces in occupied Kashmir,” he added.
He said as the UN General Assembly meeting was approaching, all efforts would be taken to draw the attention of the international community to the Kashmir issue.
In response to a query, he said former prime minister Imran Khan had adopted a strong policy on Kashmir and “my request to the federal government is that it should also adopt a similar policy on the issue” .
“We wish Pakistan to be strong because a strong and stable Pakistan is the guarantor of Kashmir’s freedom,” the president said.
In response to another query, Barrister Chaudhry said there could be no compromise on the financial and executive affairs of Azad Kashmir.

7,20 more buses arrive for metro service in Islamabad,"Two new routes under consideration, says official.","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Friday got 20 more buses that are likely to be added to the existing fleet plying on the green and blue lines. Besides, two new metro bus services are also being planned.
The 20 new buses, which the CDA procured from the National Radio and Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC), were brought to Islamabad on containers on Friday. They have been parked in a depot at Peshawar Mor.
“We are very happy today as we have received 20 more buses; we can use them on the existing green and blue lines. We are also thinking of starting two new routes,” said a CDA board member.
He, however, said a final decision to operate the new buses would be made by the CDA in the coming days, adding that the civic body was also taking steps to procure 10 more buses.

Two new routes under consideration, says official

Recently, the CDA board was briefed about the work being carried out for starting two new metro routes – Tramri Chowk to Aabpara and Wah Cantonment to the N-5 metro station –by Sept 30. Therefore, it is yet to be decided if the CDA will use the new buses on these routes or not.
On the other hand, some CDA officials said the new buses were likely to be operated on the Green Line (Bhara Kahu to Pims) and Blue Line (Koral to Pims) in place of the existing buses which were procured for the Orange Line from Peshawar Mor to Islamabad International Airport.
However, almost a month before the arrival of the buses for the Orange Line from China, the CDA started the Peshawar Mor to the airport bus service through borrowed buses of the Red Line (Rawalpindi-Islamabad Metro Bus Service).
Meanwhile, the CDA started green and blue lines with the buses of Orange Line. 
The officials said the new 20 buses would be used on these two routes and the existing ones could be shifted to the Orange Line in place of Red Line buses.
“The final decision will be made by the authority in this regard. We might opt to ply some extra buses on green and blue lines as these two routes are very busy and there is a demand for more buses on these routes,” said an official of the CDA.
Islamabad had no public bus service until the launch of the metro bus services a few months ago.
Last week, the CDA board approved setting up of the Capital Mass Transit Authority and opening of new metro bus routes. The new routes are Tramri Chowk to Aabpara and Wah Cantonment to the N-5 metro station which according to CDA will be opened by Sept 30.
The other routes - Pirwadhai to Faizabad and Nilore to Khanna Bridge - would be made functional in future.
Besides, the board was also informed that the CDA with the help of National University of Sciences and Technology (Nust) had started a study to identify potential routes for F, G, H and I series of sectors.
