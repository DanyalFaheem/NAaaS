0,Islamic Jihad leader among 15 killed in Israel’s Gaza strikes,"Group claims firing more than 100 rockets towards Israel; Hamas says Tel Aviv must pay price for ""new crime"".","GAZA CITY: Israel pounded Gaza with air strikes on Friday, killing more than 15 people, including a top commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad movement, and triggering a barrage of retaliatory rocket fire from the territory. 
Israel said it launched a pre-emptive strike against Islamic Jihad, killing its commander it blames for a series of recent attacks inside Israel. 
Islamic Jihad said the Israeli bombardment amounted to a “declaration of war”, hours before it unleashed what it said was an “initial response” of more than 100 rockets towards Israel. 
There were no immediate reports of casualties inside Israel, as officials in the country’s commercial capital Tel Aviv said they were opening the city’s bomb shelters. 

Group claims firing more than 100 rockets towards Israel; Hamas says Tel Aviv must pay price for ‘new crime’

But in Gaza, a child was among those killed, according to the territory’s health ministry, which is run by Hamas. Islamic Jihad is a separate group, but aligned with Hamas. The Israeli strikes were ongoing late Friday, targeting what the army described as militant targets across the territory it has blockaded since the Hamas takeover.
Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said the strikes were a “precise counter-terror operation against an immediate threat”. 
Flames poured out of a building in Gaza City following the first round of strikes, while wounded Palestinians were evacuated by medics. Gaza’s health ministry reported “a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation” was among nine people killed. A further 55 Palestinians were wounded, the ministry said. 
Five-year-old Alaa Kaddum had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral. 
Islamic Jihad said several members of its military wing were among those killed, including “the great fighter Taysir al-Jabari ‘Abu Mahmoud’, the commander of the Al Quds Brigade in the northern region of Gaza Strip”. 
Hundreds of mourners gathered in Gaza City for the funerals of Jabari and others killed in the air strikes. 
Israeli military spokesman Richard Hecht said “we are assuming about 15 killed in action” in Gaza. Israeli tanks were lined up along the border and the military said on Thursday it was reinforcing its troops. 
US ambassador Tom Nides said Washington “firmly believes that Israel has a right to protect itself”. “We are engaging with different parties and urge all sides for calm,” he wrote on Twitter. 

 





 
UN Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he was “deeply concerned”, warning that the escalation was “very dangerous”. 
‘Pay the price’ 
The strikes come four days after Israel closed its two border crossings with Gaza and restricted the movement of Israeli civilians living near the frontier, citing security concerns. The measures follow the arrest in the occupied West Bank of two senior members of Islamic Jihad, which has a strong presence in Gaza. 
Gaza City resident Abdullah al-Arayshi said the situation was “very tense”. 
“The country is ravaged. We’ve had enough of wars. Our generation has lost its future,” he said. 
Hamas, the group which rules Gaza, said Israel has “committed a new crime for which it must pay the price”. “The resistance in all its military arms and factions is united in this struggle and will speak loudly... All fronts must open fire on the enemy,” it said in a statement. 
Lapid, who met his security chiefs through the day, said: “Anyone who tries to harm Israel should know — we will find you.” 
The office of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas said the Israeli military action amounted to a “dangerous escalation” and called on the international community to curb Israeli “aggression”. The Israeli military banned large gatherings in communities within 80km of the Gaza frontier until Saturday evening. The measure follows four days of road closures and other restrictions in the border area. 
Palestinians including patients and those with Israeli work permits have been prevented from leaving the Gaza Strip since Tuesday, while the goods crossing has also been shut.

1,China scraps cooperation with US over Taiwan spat,Washington summons Chinese ambassador over military actions; Beijing sanctions Pelosi over Taipei visit...,"BEIJING: China said on Friday it was ending cooperation with the United States on a litany of key issues, including climate change, anti-drug efforts and military talks, as relations between the two superpowers nosedive over the island of Taiwan. 
In Washington, the White House summoned China’s ambassador to Washington to condemn the “irresponsible” behaviour of Beijing over Taiwan, a senior US official said on Friday. 
John Kirby, spokesman for the National Secu­rity Council, said Ambassador Qin Gang was summoned following China’s military sabre rattling in response to a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to self-ruled, democratic Taiwan. Kirby, who also described China’s actions as “provocative,” did not say which officials met the ambassador. 
“We condemned the PRC’s military actions, which are irresponsible, at odds with our long-standing goal of maintaining peace and stability and across the Taiwan Strait,” he said, referring to China by its official acronym for the People’s Republic of China. 

Washington summons Chinese ambassador over military actions; Beijing sanctions Pelosi over Taipei visit

Beijing has reacted furiously to a visit by Nancy Pelosi to the island, which it claims as its territory and has vowed to retake, by force if necessary. 
It has since Thursday encircled the self-ruled, democratic island with a series of huge military drills that have been roundly condemned by the United States and other Western allies. 
And Friday saw its foreign ministry hit back further against the United States, suspending talks and cooperation on multiple agreements between the two — including on fighting climate change. 
The world’s two largest polluters last year pledged to work together to accelerate climate action this decade, and vowed to meet regularly to “address the climate crisis”. But that deal looks shaky as relations sink to some of their lowest levels in years, as do agreements on everything from talks on military matters to anti-drug cooperation. 
Pelosi — who was also hit with sanctions by Beijing for the visit — has defended her trip to Taiwan, saying on Friday that Washington would “not allow” China to isolate the island. 
Chinese ministry said Pelosi was “seriously interfering in China’s internal affairs and seriously undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity” with the visit, and that Beijing would “impose sanctions on Pelosi and her immediate family”, without giving further details.
Taiwan has also condemned Beijing’s furious response to the visit, with premier Su Tseng-chang calling for allies to push for de-escalation. “(We) didn’t expect that the evil neighbour next door would show off its power at our door and arbitrarily jeopardise the busiest waterways in the world with its military exercises,” he told reporters. 
‘Our motherland is powerful’ 
Beijing has said its military exercises will continue until midday on Sunday, and Taipei reported 68 Chinese planes and 13 warships crossed the “median line” that runs down the Taiwan Strait on Friday. 
On the Chinese island of Pingtan a fighter jet flew overhead, prompting tourists to snap photos as it flew along the coast. A Chinese military vessel was also visible sailing through the Taiwan Strait, they added. 
China’s drills involved a “conventional missile firepower assault” in waters to the east of Taiwan, the Chinese military said. 
And state broadcaster CCTV reported that Chinese missiles had flown directly over Taiwan — a major escalation if officially confirmed. 
‘Significant escalation’ 
China’s ruling Communist Party views Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to one day take it, by force if necessary. But the scale and intensity of the drills have triggered outrage in the United States and other democracies. 
“These provocative actions are a significant escalation,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said after talks with South­east Asian foreign ministers in Phnom Penh. 
“The fact is, the speaker’s visit was peaceful. There is no justification for this extreme, disproportionate and escalatory military response,” he added. 
Japan lodged a formal diplomatic complaint against Beijing, with five of China’s missiles believed to have landed in its exclusive economic zone. 
And Australia — which has a troubled relationship with China, its largest trading partner — condemned the drills as “disproportionate and destabilising”.

2,Explosion in Hazara area claims 8 lives,"KABUL: A bomb attached to a handcart exploded in Kabul on Friday, officials said, killing eight civilians in an area...","KABUL: A bomb attached to a handcart exploded in Kabul on Friday, officials said, killing eight civilians in an area largely inhabited by Afghanistan’s Shia community. 
The blast, which took place when Shia community members in Afghanistan are commemorating  Muharram also injured 18 people, police spokesman Khalid Zadran said in a statement to reporters. 
“Security teams are trying to find the perpetrators,” Zadran said. 
The explosives were attached to a handcart loaded with vegetables and parked in an area where residents shopped for daily food items, Zadran said. The explosion occurred in a west Kabul neighbourhood that is mainly inhabited by members of the Shia Hazara community. The blast came just days ahead of Ashura. 
Government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid confirmed the toll, saying the bombing was the “work of those who are enemies of Islam and the country”. 
The blast was claimed by the militant Islamic State group. 
The group said on one of its telegram channels that IS fighters “detonated the bomb”. 
The number of attacks has fallen since the Taliban returned to power, but IS has continued to target Shias.

3,"Putin, Erdogan agree to boost economic cooperation","Kremlin says two leaders have agreed ""to meet the expectations of the opposite side in the spheres of economy and energy"".","MOSCOW: President Vladimir Putin and Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday adopted a statement pledging to boost political and economic cooperation including in energy and trade. 
The talks between Putin and Erdogan came as Russia’s isolation grows following its intervention in Ukraine. 
“Despite the current regional and global challenges, the leaders reaffirmed their common will to further develop Russian-Turkish relations,” the Kremlin said in a statement following the four-hour talks in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi. 
Putin and Erdogan agreed to ramp up trade and boost economic and energy cooperation with a focus on transport, agriculture, tourism, and construction.
The statement said the two leaders agreed “to meet the expectations of the opposite side in the spheres of economy and energy”. 
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak, speaking in televised remarks, called the agreements “very important”, with ties aiming to reach “a new level of development” across “virtually all sectors”. 
Putin and Erdogan also stressed the importance of “sincere, frank and trusting relationships” to achieve regional and global stability, the Kremlin said. 
While Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine was not explicitly mentioned in the statement, the leaders stressed the resumption of Ukrainian grain shipments, pointing to the two countries’ “constructive relations” that they stressed made the agreement possible. 
The statement also made no direct mention of any new offensive that Turkey might be planning against Kurdish militants in Syria. 
“The parties confirmed that they attach great importance to advancing the political process” in Syria, the statement said. “The determination to act jointly and in close coordination with each other in the fight against all terrorist organisations was reaffirmed.” 
At the start of the talks Putin also praised the TurkStream natural gas pipeline project, saying Europe should be grateful to Turkey for uninterrupted supplies of Russian gas. “I believe that (today’s meeting) will open a whole different page in Turkish-Russian relations,” Erdogan said. 
Putin and Erdogan last met for a three-way summit in Iran in July. 
At the time Putin told Erdogan that Russia remained opposed to any new offensive that Turkey might be planning against Kurdish militants in northern Syria.

4,Monsoon emergency in place as minister warns of more rains from today,"Islamabad, Kashmir, Punjab, KP, Balochistan and Sindh will receive heavy rainfall from August 6 till 9, says Sherry Rehman.","ISLAMABAD: Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Friday warned citizens of more rains — starting today (Saturday) — after the federal cabinet declared a “monsoon emergency”.
In a tweet on Friday, she said: “According to the Pakistan Met Department, the country will experience more rains in the coming week. Islamabad, Kashmir, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Sindh will receive heavy rainfall from August 6 till 9. 
“Furthermore, these areas including Gilgit Baltistan will also experience strong winds and thundershowers from August 10 to 13. All federal and provincial agencies have been advised to stay on alert and take necessary precautions. In the meantime, all district commissioners and provincial administrations should be mobilised to prevent loss of lives.”

 





 
She said the water level in Chenab, Jhelum and Ravi rivers might rise with a risk of flash flooding in local rivers and nullahs in majority of the cities and towns in these provinces.
Travellers and tourists should travel in consideration of the weather conditions and be more careful while travelling, especially in the northern areas and Kashmir as rains may trigger landslides in hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Galiyat, Murree, Chilas, Diamer, Gilgit, Hunza, Astore, Ghizer and Skardu, she said.
The minister said the effects of climate change continued to exacerbate in the country as “we have experienced lengthy heat waves, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) and forest fires”.
Editorial: Rain disaster
She said Balochistan recorded more than 600pc above-normal rainfall during this monsoon spell since mid-June while Sindh received 500pc more rain.
“Major cities are being warned against urban flooding, prolonged electricity outages, and flash floods,” she added.
She further wrote that the federal government was making assessments of the damage caused by rains and the prime minister had visited many flood-hit areas himself along with the many ministerial committees.
Ms Rehman said all departments continued to survey disaster-struck areas.
“The federal government will release timely compensations to the families of those who have lost their loved ones and who have lost their homes in these devastating floods. 
“We will be moving towards building medium-term resilience after the edge of the crisis is over,” she added.

5,Boris Johnson ‘on leave’ as UK economic crisis deepens,Bank of England warns of incoming year-long recession.,"LONDON: A British cabinet member admitted on Friday “I don’t know where Boris is” as the prime minister checked out on holiday, in a week that saw the Bank of England warn a year-long recession is coming. 
Boris Johnson has since Wednesday been on a belated honeymoon with wife Carrie. Downing Street has refused to say where, but The Times newspaper said the couple were in Slovenia. 
Johnson will have a lot more time on his hands after September 6, when he is due to hand over to either Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak as Conservative leader, but decided to take a break sooner. 
The opposition Labour party accused the government’s two senior-most ministers of being “missing in action” — with Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi also on holiday this week. 
“I don’t know where Boris is, but I’m in constant contact with him,” Business Secretary and Truss supporter Kwasi Kwarteng told Times Radio. 

Bank of England warns of incoming year-long recession

He said he exchanges WhatsApp messages with both Johnson and Zahawi “all the time”, and insisted that criticism the government was doing nothing about the economic crisis was “false”.
Zahawi said he had remained in touch with Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey on Thursday after the central bank hiked interest rates from 1.25 per cent to 1.75pc, the biggest rise in 27 years. 
The bank is trying to rein in surging inflation, which it warned could peak at 13.3 per cent, as it forecast the UK economy would enter a recession in the fourth quarter that will last until late 2023.
“For me, like I’m sure lots of others, there is no such thing as a holiday and not working. I never had that in the private sector, not in government,” Zahawi said in a statement. 
Magical solutions
Foreign Secretary Truss and Sunak, Zahawi’s predecessor as chancellor, clashed anew over how to address the crisis in a televised debate on Thursday.
“The reality is we’re facing a recession if we carry on with our business-as-usual policies,” Truss, who is leading in surveys of Tory members, told reporters on Friday.
She plans an emergency budget to lower taxes immediately to combat the cost-of-living crisis, and to review the independent Bank of England’s inflation-fighting mandate.
But Sunak said tax cuts financed with more borrowing would force the bank to increase interest rates even more, insisting on the need to maintain fiscal rigour and tame the price pressures first.
Former cabinet minister Liam Fox, who supports Sunak, warned against “magical solutions” via debt-financed tax cuts as proposed by Truss.
At Thursday’s Sky News debate, Truss was forced on the back foot after the moderator highlighted her shifting stances over the years, including a major policy U-turn this week on pay for public-sector workers.
But Sunak also faced embarrassment after video emerged of him telling grassroots Tories in wealthy Kent last week that, as chancellor, he had diverted government funds away from “deprived urban areas”.
His campaign said that in the video, obtained on Friday by the New Statesman magazine, Sunak had merely stressed the need to shift the focus of government help to other towns and rural areas.
But senior Labour MP Lisa Nandy said: “This leadership race is revealing the Conservatives’ true colours.
“It’s scandalous that Rishi Sunak is openly boasting that he fixed the rules to funnel taxpayers’ money to prosperous Tory shires.”
