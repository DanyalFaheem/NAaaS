0,Changes in JCP rules urged to avoid ‘factions’ in judiciary,PBC representative writes to CJP about ‘controversial’ July 28 meeting...,"ISLAMABAD: As the controversy about the July 28 session of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) refuses to die down, a senior member representing the premier Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) believed the issue would not have cropped up if the meeting had not been ‘abruptly terminated’ and a formal vote and final decision were recorded in the minutes at its end.
Under all circumstances, it was essential that JCP meetings ended with a formal vote taking, as it was entirely possible that one or more commission members might change their minds after listening to their colleagues, senior JCP member Akhtar Hussain wrote in a four-page letter on Friday to Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, who heads the commission.
This was a fifth letter to Chief Justice Bandial in a week about the JCP meeting, after Justice Qazi Faez Isa, Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, Attorney General for Pakistan Ashtar Ausaf and Justice Sajjad Ali Shah had expressed their concerns.
While emphasising that the fierce and evident division that cropped up within the judicial institution was not in the national interest, Mr Hussain regretted that the blame of this division could be rested at many doors, but added that the solution lay, first and foremost, at the doors of the CJP as the head of the legal fraternity of Pakistan. “Even otherwise on a personal level, your lordship’s calm and unfailingly courteous disposition makes you best suited for the onerous task of once again uniting our fraternity,” the letter said, adding: “Let that be your legacy.”

PBC representative writes to CJP about ‘controversial’ July 28 meeting

Mr Hussain highlighted that the only solution to avoid factionalism, which was unfortunately prevailing, was to amend the JCP rules and frame more objective, transparent and measurable criteria and processes for the nomination and appointment of judges.
The senior counsel recommended that the rule-making committee of the commission be activated under the chairmanship of a senior puisne judge as per past practice, with a clear mandate to solicit the views of all stakeholders and thereafter devise draft rules and criteria for appointments for the approval of the commission within four weeks.
In the past few meetings of the commission, and especially the last one, there is a clear consensus among a majority of the commission members to amend JCP rules, the letter reminded, adding there was a clear majority for adhering to seniority principle. Until this process was completed, all commission members should be allowed to propose nominees for appointment rather than the CJP alone. 
This must be treated as a decision of the commission and implemented accordingly rather than needlessly making alternative nominations, which are then not approved as has happened on the last three occasions, according to him.
The member also expressed regret over Justice Sajjad Ali Shah’s observations and said certain discussions that took place in the JCP had the effect of harming the reputation of the judges concerned. He said it was exactly for that reason deliberations of the commission were confidential — to strike a balance between the desire for a free and frank exchange of views regarding candidates whilst protecting the reputations of those being discussed. 
It was all the more necessary to consult all commission members before deciding to release the audio recordings in relaxation of the rules, he reasoned.
Perhaps, had such consultation been held, it would have been possible to issue a consensus minutes of the meeting, recording the exact positions of the members in majority and minority without delving into “unnecessary details and leaving no need for issuance of the audio record”, the JCP member said.
In the first place, he said, writing of such letters and the issuance of press releases and audio proceedings of the JCP should not have been necessary. If the July 28 meeting had not been abruptly terminated and a formal vote and final decision had been recorded in the minutes at the end of the meeting, this occasion would not have arisen, he added.
In view of the disquiet being expressed within the judiciary, the bar and public in general, the time has come to accept at least some limitations and restrictions in our discretion, Mr Hussain said. “Since the day I have become a member of the commission; I have been emphasising that our proceedings and decisions should be a deliberative, collective and collegiate exercise,” the JCP member said. 
“We must not divide ourselves in camps nor treat the commission’s decisions as an internal election. We must neither seek to rush through our favoured candidates when we feel we are in the majority nor seek to unnecessarily postpone when we feel we are in minority,” he said.

4,Imran urged to name ‘neutrals’ who backed CEC’s appointment,KARACHI: Coalition government mouthpieces on Friday asked PTI chairman Imran Khan to name the “neutrals” who ...,"KARACHI: Coalition government mouthpieces on Friday asked PTI chairman Imran Khan to name the “neutrals” who gave him guarantees over Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja’s appointment. 
“We demand that you tell us the names of those neutrals,” PML-N’s Malik Ahmed Khan said at a press conference in Islamabad, Dawn.com reported. 
Ahmed Khan and PPP leader Saeed Ghani’s statements come in response to claims made by Imran Khan in a recent interview to Express News. The ex-premier had claimed that it was the neutrals — a euphemism he uses to describe the establishment — who suggested Raja’s name as the CEC. 
He said that under the 18th Amendment, heads of NAB, ECP and caretaker governments were supposed to be decided amicably by all the political parties. 
“At the time of CEC’s appointment, there was a deadlock [among the parties]. So, the neutrals approached us and said the country needed to move forward. “They suggested Sikandar Sultan’s name. I didn’t even know him. But people told us that he was PML-N’s man,” the PTI chief said, adding that when he told the neutrals about this, they guaranteed that the CEC would stay neutral. 
Ahmed Khan said: “Show some spine and tell us who were the neutrals who gave you this guarantee. 
“Did [Army chief] Gen Bajwa say this to you? And if yes, please have some audacity […] have some courage [… ] and say it. If Gen Faiz Hameed said this, please take his name and say it plainly,” he said. 
Separately, talking to reporters in Karachi, Mr Ghani said Imran himself had appointed the CEC and then blamed the “neutrals” for it. 
“Who from the neutrals said it? Tell us the name,” he asked. “It will be more fun when he says the name — just ask him. 
“Neutrals aren’t just a thing. There must be some people who he [Imran] said passed instructions or pressurised or suggested the [CEC’s] name […] tell us their names. Who said this to you?”

5,Anti-India rallies held to mark ‘exploitation of Kashmir’,"President, PM reiterate support for Kashmiris’ legitimate rights; OIC says Delhi’s illegal action cannot alter disputed status...","MUZAFFARABAD: People across Pakistan and the divided state of Jammu and Kashmir marked the third anniversary of India’s illegal action of revoking the special status of occupied Kashmir as “Exploitation [of Kashmir] Day” by holding anti-India demonstrations and other events.  
In their messages, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari paid glowing tributes to the struggling Kashmiris for their supreme sacrifices for their noble cause and reiterated that Pakistan would not only continue to be their voice but would also extend them all possible support for the fullest realisation of their legitimate rights.  
They urged the international community in general and the UN in particular to address the festering issue in accordance with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and the aspirations of Kashmiris for the sake of lasting peace.  
In UN headquarters, the OIC General Secretariat on Friday reminded India that its Aug 5, 2019, illegal action could not alter the disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir.  

President, PM reiterate support for Kashmiris’ legitimate rights; OIC says Delhi’s illegal action cannot alter disputed status of Kashmir

In a statement distributed in the UN headquarters, the OIC reiterated its earlier calls for implementing UNSC resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir, which recognise the right of the Kashmiri people to decide their own future. 
In his message, President Alvi said: “India’s actions of Aug 5, 2019, contravene several UN Security Council resolutions which stipulated that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir will be made in accordance with the will of the people through a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the United Nations.”  
PM Sharif said that the Indian government, under the hold of the BJP-RSS combine, was unabashedly pushing its ‘Hindutva’ agenda to alter the demographic structure of occupied Kashmir in a blatant violation of the Security Council resolutions and international laws, including the 4th Geneva Convention. “India’s settler-colonialism mindset is driven by its quest to permanently occupy the disputed territory and to obliterate its distinct Kashmiri identity.” 
He noted that India had turned occupied Kashmir into the largest prison on the planet, where there was no let-up in brutal repression of the innocent Kashmiri people, including arbitrary arrests and indiscriminate extra-judicial killings. “As expected, the Kashmiri people have valiantly defied the Indian campaign of brutalisation against them. Pakistan has lent all possible support to the Kashmiris in pursuit of their just cause. India stands exposed before the world, yet again, as an aggressor and oppressor,” he said. 
“In fact, the world community must press India to halt its human rights abuses, reverse demographic changes and India’s illegal actions of Aug 5, 2019 in occupied Kashmir to enable the Kashmiris to exercise their right to self-determination through the immediate implementation of relevant Security Council resolutions.” 
Pointing out India had thrashed the UNSC resolutions by changing Article 370 and repealing Article 35A, Mr Bhutto-Zardari urged the UN to play its part to get the Kashmiris their internationally acknowledged rights. 
On Friday, the Senate of Pakistan also offered Fateha, which was led by Senator Mushtaq Ahmed, for the Kashmiris martyred by Indian occupation forces. 
Public meeting
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) the main event was a public meeting and a charged rally in Muzaffarabad, organised by Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu Kashmir (PHJK), an organisation of post-1989 migrants from occupied Kashmir. 
The rally which was taken out after the conclusion of the public meeting at Burhan Wani Chowk ended outside the UN military observers’ office, where participants torched a large Indian tricolour flag before presenting a memorandum to UN officials. 
Earlier, speaking at the public meeting, AJK Prime Minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas said that India’s Aug 5, 2019, move was a deep-rooted conspiracy aimed at eroding the special identity, culture and traditions of the occupied territory on the one hand and changing its demography to turn majority Muslim population into minority on the other. 
Former AJK premier Raja Farooq Haider said the “silence of the government of Pakistan was causing unrest among the Kashmiris on both sides of the divide”. 
Earlier, at 9am, one-minute silence was observed across AJK and Pakistan to pay tributes to valiant Kashmiris, followed by special prayers for the success of their struggle for emancipation.

6,Balochistan govt denies sub-standard work behind breaches in dams,At least 12 dams breached in the province as a result of flash floods caused by heavy rains.,"QUETTA: After at least 12 dams in the province were breached as a result of flash floods caused by heavy rains, the Balochistan government on Friday dispelled the impression that sub-standard construction and alleged corruption was the reason for the breaches.
Speaking at a press conference along with provincial ministers Syed Ehsan Shah, Mir Naseebullah Khan and Advisor to Chief Minister on Home and Tribal Affairs Mir Ziaullah Langove, Minister for Irrigation Muhammad Khan Lehri said that the 12 dams, which gave way in different areas of the province, were not poorly constructed. 
He added that the damage was caused due to the inflow of more water than their capacity, adding that repair work on these dams would be expedited. 
Mr Lehri said that an inspection team had been tasked with ascertaining the reasons behind the dams’ breaking, as well as to assess damage to other dams in the province. He added that 16 bridges were also washed away, cutting off road communications between Balochistan and other provinces. 
“We are making all out efforts to restore traffic on all highways and link roads as soon as possible,” he said. 
Balochistan has received “500 per cent more rains than average” which resulted in massive destruction in the province, including loss of human lives, he said. 
Addressing the press conference, Balochistan Health Minister Syed Ehsan Shah said the health department was providing all possible facilities to flood victims. 
He added that medical camps have been set up in these areas, while medicines, including anti-snake venom serums and vaccines for cholera and other diseases have also been dispatched. He said a team of doctors was sent to Zhob after the health department received information of a cholera outbreak in the area.
Education Minister Nasebullah Khan and Advisor to CM Mir Ziaullah Langove said the government was providing all out help to the affected people. 
“Rescue and relief operation will continue in all affected areas, while rehabilitation work would be launched soon across the province,” they said. 
Replying to statements by former Chief Minister Jam Kamal about ignoring Lasbela district, the ministers said that all machinery and officials were present in the district and relief and rescue operations were underway.

8,Balochistan’s child marriage bill in limbo for eight years,Stakeholders resolve to form committee for consensus on age limit for marriage.,"QUETTA: Despite being submitted to the cabinet for approval, the draft of the child marriage bill has been pending before the Balochistan Assembly for the last eight years, a legislator told a consultation meeting on the issue of child marriage.
Dr Shama Ishaq, a politician from the National Party, said that this was due to hurdles created by certain quarters.
The consultation, held in collaboration with the Education Youth Empowerment Society, Blue Veins, and Girls Not Brides, decided that a committee comprising all stakeholders would be formed to initiate dialogue with the heads of political parties on the issue of child marriage and reach consensus on the age limit.
The session was presided over by Balochistan’s Parliamentary Secretary on Law and Parliamentary Affairs, Science & Technology Dr Rubaba Khan Buledi.

Stakeholders resolve to form committee for consensus on age limit for marriage

The participants expressed serious concern over the negative attitude of religious parties and some other quarters regarding the child marriage bill. 
Female legislators said that while women MPAs made all possible efforts to reach consensus on the age limit and persuaded the male MPAs to support the child marriage bill, they faced strong opposition from the religious parties’ legislators on the issue of the age limit.
Dr Buledi and Parliamentary Secretary on Women’s Development Mahjabeen Sheeran informed the meeting that the bill was sent to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) twice for its opinion on the age limit issue. The CII chairman had sent his recommendations, but once again these were sent to the council for review.
Commission on the Status of Women Balochistan Chairperson Fauzia Shaheen and Dr Buledi suggested that a special committee should be set up which would hold meetings with the political party’s heads and get approval from them for consensus on the age limit for child marriage.
