0,Rs30bn taxes to be imposed to save PSO from default,"Govt struggles to arrange Rs100bn emergency funding to avoid default on oil, gas payments and keep IMF staff-level pact intact.","ISLAMABAD: The government has decided to impose additional taxes to the tune of Rs30 billion as it struggles to arrange Rs100bn emergency funding to avoid international default on oil and gas payments and keep the staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) intact.
The decision was taken at a special meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet presided over by Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Sunday. 
The meeting was informed that the budgetary commitment with the IMF for Rs153bn primary budget surplus could not be met without additional taxation. 
The ECC also decided to examine reducing the price adjustments on a weekly or 10-day basis from existing fortnightly pricing to minimise price uncertainties.

Decision taken for smooth continuity of oil and gas national supply chain

The ECC “directed Finance Division and Federal Board of Revenue to submit proposal for generation of Rs30 billion through taxes within a week”, said an announcement after the meeting. 
It also approved a supplementary budget grant of Rs30bn for immediate payment to state-run Pakistan State Oil (PSO) facing international payment obligations of about Rs270bn till August 28.
“For the smooth continuity of oil and gas national supply chain and avoid PSO from being default on international payments, the ECC decided to clear the outstanding payments accumulated during the period of pervious government,” the announcement said. It also directed the Power Division to make immediate payments of the current outstanding amount of Rs20bn within 24 hours and another Rs12.8bn by August 4 (Thursday).
Sources in the Petroleum Division said PSO’s receivables had touched Rs608bn on July 28, including Rs340bn from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) alone. A major contributing factor was the LNG supply that added a cash shortfall of Rs213bn since July 1, 2021. SNGPL, on its part, had been constrained by delayed payments by the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) whose receivables jumped to Rs113bn from Rs43bn since January 1, 2022. CPPA had another Rs182bn direct payables to PSO on account of fuel supplies, including Rs16bn accumulated since July 1, 2022.
The petroleum secretary pleaded that PSO had been raising SOS calls to avoid international default as delay in payments by respective entities had exhausted its liquidity. As a result, the company has not been able to deposit Rs81bn to the government’s local currency (NIDA) account for onward transmission to Kuwait Petroleum Cooperation (KPC) which is contractual obligation.
Moreover, PSO had not been able to deposit Rs16bn to the government against an integrated term finance certificate (ITFC) facility, which has been deferred to avoid PSO’s international contractual obligations.
The meeting was told that there has been a decline of sales of high speed diesel (HSD) and petrol by 28pc and 32pc, respectively, that had an impact of Rs69bn on collections, while about 17.8pc devaluation of rupee against dollar in July had resulted in increased cost of procurement of these products by Rs63bn. It was reported that PSO had foreign exchange loss of about Rs85bn over the years and Rs55bn of it was still outstanding.
The meeting was told that despite these challenges PSO had met its contractual international payments in July, 2022 but “this will not be possible in August” which will result in disruption of the supply chain. 
PSO has to make an international payment of Rs267bn in the first fortnight of August 2022. The collections during the first fortnight of August were expected at Rs157bn, leaving a net deficit of Rs100bn.
While the petroleum division made a pitch for total Rs133bn payments, the finance ministry explained that there was “no budgetary allocation in current fiscal year” for this account; therefore financial support has to be arranged through a supplementary grant. Even then, considering fiscal constraints and understanding with the IMF, the supplementary grant so provided will result in outflow beyond the numbers agreed with the IMF.
Therefore, against a demand for Rs54bn, Rs30bn supplementary grant was approved which would be booked as expenditure and then matching taxes would have to be generated to compensate for the revenue loss to “achieve primary balance agreed with the IMF”. 
In addition, the government would separately direct the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) and other banks to extend credit limits to PSO and SNGPL on emergency basis to meet remaining Rs45bn funding.
The ECC also directed Petroleum Division to work out in consultation with OGRA other options of setting up petroleum product prices within a week. The ECC directed Petroleum Division for submission of proposal within a week to regulate the prices of Kerosene Oil and Light Diesel Oil after consultation with relevant stakeholders.

1,Grain tycoon killed in Mykolaiv bombardment,Russia says drone attack on navy command in Crimea leaves six personnel wounded.,"KYIV: Ukraine said the “strongest” shelling by Moscow so far of the southern city Mykolaiv killed a grain tycoon on Sunday, as Russia claimed an attack from a drone wounded six personnel at the headquarters of its Black Sea fleet in annexed Crimea. 
AFP journalists witnessed intense Russian bombardment of the eastern town of Bakhmut after President Volod­ymyr Zele­nsky called for civilians to leave the front line Donetsk region bearing the brunt of the Kremlin’s offensive. 
Russian authorities in the Crimean Black Sea peninsula — seized by Moscow from Ukraine in 2014 — said a small explosive device from a commercial drone, likely launched nearby, hit the navy command in Sevastopol. 
The local mayor blamed “Ukrainian nationalists” for the attack that forced the cancellation of festivities in the city marking Russia’s annual holiday celebrating the navy. 

Russia says drone attack on navy command in Crimea leaves six personnel wounded

But a spokesman for Ukraine’s Odessa region military administration denied Kyiv — whose nearest positions are some 200 kilometres away — was responsible and called the incident “a sheer provocation”. 
“Our liberation of Crimea from the occupiers will be carried out in another way and much more effectively,” spokesman Sergiy Bratchuk wrote on Telegram. 
Authorities in Ukraine’s southern city of Mykolaiv said Sunday that widespread Russian bombardments overnight had left at least two civilians dead, as Moscow continued to pummel the sprawling front line. “Myko­laiv was subjected to mass shelling today. Probably the strongest so far,” the city’s mayor Oleksandr Senke­vych wrote on Telegram. 
The authorities said leading Ukrai­nian agricultural magnate Oleksiy Vadatursky, 74, and his wife Raisa were killed when a missile struck their house. 
Vadatursky, who was ran­ked Ukraine’s 24th richest man with a fortune worth $430m by Forbes, owned major grain exp­orter Nibulon and was previously decorated with the prestigious “Hero of Ukraine” award. 
First ship carrying grain to leave Ukraine today
The intense bombardments around Ukraine come as the authorities push to restart grain exports under a plan brokered by the UN and Turkey to lift a Russian naval blockade. 
A spokesman for the Turkish presidency said there was a “high probability” that a first ship carrying Ukrainian grain could leave Ukraine on Monday. 
Strikes also pounded the northeastern regions of Kharkiv and Sumy, near the front line with the Russian forces. 
“Today a whole succession of explosions took place... a few buildings are reportedly damaged,” Igor Terekhov the mayor of Ukraine’s second city Kharkiv said. 
Sumy regional chief Dmytro Zhyvytsky said that some 50 strikes on Saturday evening had left one person dead and two wounded. 
The governor of the Donetsk region, where Moscow is focusing the brunt of its attacks, said three civilians were killed and eight wounded in shelling on Saturday.

2,Laden family donated $1m to Prince Charles charity: report,"Revelation increases scrutiny on prince’s charity organisations, which have been rocked by allegations of criminal wrongdoing.","LONDON: Prince Char­les, the heir to the British throne, accepted a $1.19 million donation to his charitable trust from the family of 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, The Sunday Times reported.
Although there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the Saudi family members, the revelation increases scrutiny on the 73-year-old prince’s charity organisations, which have been rocked by allegations of criminal wrongdoing.
Several of his advisers urged Charles not to take the donation from family patriarch Bakr bin Laden and his brother Shafiq — half-brothers of terror leader Osama — according to sources cited by the paper.
Charles, 73, agreed to the donation to the Prince of Wales Charitable Fund (PWCF) when he met Bakr, 76, at Clarence House in London in 2013, despite objections of advisers from the trust and his office, the paper reported.
Ian Cheshire, chairman of PWCF, said the donation was agreed by the five trustees at the time.
British police in Febr­uary launched an investigation into another of Charles’s charitable foundations over claims of a cash-for-honours scandal involving a Saudi businessman.
The head of The Prince’s Foundation resigned last year after an internal investigation into the allegations.
Michael Fawcett, chief executive of the foundation, had initially agreed to suspend his duties following newspaper revelations about his links to a Saudi national.
The man, tycoon Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, had donated large sums to restoration projects of particular interest to Charles.
Fawcett, a former valet to the Prince of Wales who has been close to Queen Elizabeth II’s heir for decades, is alleged to have coordinated efforts to grant a royal honour and even UK citizenship to Mahfouz.
Mahfouz reportedly denies any wrongdoing.
The Charities Commi­ssion, which registers and oversees charities in England and Wales, said in November it had opened a formal probe into donations received by Mahfouz’s charitable trust which were intended for the prince’s foundation.
The Prince’s Foun­da­tion, set up in 1986, is not regulated by the Charities Commission but is registered with the Scottish Charity Regulator.
The Scottish body in September launched its own probe into reports that the foundation accepted cash from a Russian banker previously convicted of money laundering.

3,"Iranian, Taliban border guards clash",Both sides accuse each other of opening fire first...,"TEHRAN: Clashes broke out on Sunday between Iranian border guards and Taliban forces, officials said, with the Afghan side confirming the killing of one of their border officers. 
Both sides accused the other of opening fire first.
“There was a clash between the border guards of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Taliban forces,” Meysam Barazandeh, governor of Iran’s Hirmand county, was quoted as saying by the Fars news agency. “The conflict was brief and has ended,” he added. 
Fars reported that clashes took 
place on the Iranian side of the border, in the Shaghalak area of Hirmand county, in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan.

Both sides accuse each other of opening fire first

“A border violation by the Taliban took place today,” Barazandeh said, adding that “our forces gave the necessary response”, and that there “were no casualties” on the Iranian side.
Iran’s Tasnim news agency said Taliban forces shot at some houses in the town of Dust Mohammad, which was followed by an exchange of fire “for several minutes”. 
A statement issued by Afghanistan’s Nimroz provincial information centre blamed Iranian border guards for the incident.
“Iranian border forces fired at a patrol of our border forces in Kang district of Nimroz province,” the statement said.
“After that they (Iranian forces) fired in the area with light and heavy weapons. In this shooting, one of our border force personnel was martyred and another injured,” it added.

4,"Pelosi begins Asia tour, no mention of Taiwan",Beijing ramps up military exercises in South China Sea...,"WASHINGTON: US House of Repre­sentatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi will lead a congressional delegation to the Asia-Pacific region, her office confir­med on Sunday, with stops in Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea and Japan.
The statement made no mention of whether the six-member delegation would visit Taiwan, a flashpoint in conversations between China and the United States in the run-up to the trip.
“The trip will focus on mutual secur­ity, economic partnership and democr­atic governance in the Indo-Pacific reg­ion,” Pelosi’s office said in a statement.
The all-Democrat delegation incl­udes Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Gregory Meeks and members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Armed Services Committee.

Beijing ramps up military exercises in South China Sea

“Our delegation will hold high-level meetings to discuss how we can further advance our shared interests and values, including peace and security, economic growth and trade, the Covid-19 pandemic, the climate crisis, human rights and democratic governance,” said Pelosi in the statement.
Singapore’s foreign ministry confir­med Pelosi’s delegation would visit the city-state on August 1 and 2, with meetings scheduled with President Halimah Yacob and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.
Tensions over Taiwan 
For weeks, US-China tensions had heightened over reports that Pelosi may visit the island of Taiwan that China sees as part of its territory.
On Thursday, President Joe Biden and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping held a tense phone call. They agreed to schedule their first in-person summit but disagreements over Taiwan clouded the conversation, with Xi making an oblique warning to the US not to “play with fire” over the island.
The United States maintains a policy of “strategic ambiguity” over whether it would intervene militarily were China to invade Taiwan, and while it recognises Beijing’s claim to the island, it also backs the democratic Taiwanese government.
In the latest warning from Beijing, Chinese air force spokesman Shen Jinke on Sunday said defending China’s territory was the military’s “sacred mission”.
“The air force has firm determination, full confidence and sufficient capabilities to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Shen said, according to the state-run People’s Daily.
Over the last two years, China has ramped up flights by fighter jets, bombers and other aircraft into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone as a way to signal displeasure and keep Taipei’s own military stretched.
“The air force’s multi-type fighter jets fly around the motherland’s Taiwan, practising to enhance its ability to maintain national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Shen said.
Chinese military held live-firing drills in the waters off Fujian province, over a 100km (62 miles) away from Taiwan, according to local authorities. Chinese coast guard will hold an exercise in the South China Sea off Guan­gzhou province on Monday, according to another notice by the Maritime Safety Administration.

5,Beirut’s blast-damaged grain silos partially collapse,"Two towers fell in heavily damaged silos’ northern section, where fire has been burning for more than two weeks, reports media.","BEIRUT: Parts of Beirut’s grain silos collapsed on Sunday, just days before the second anniversary of a catastrophic explosion at the Lebanese capital’s port that ravaged the stores and parts of the city. 
Also on Sunday, US envoy Amos Hochstein arrived in Beirut to push talks to resolve a bitter maritime border dispute between Lebanon and Israel over Mediterranean waters with offshore gas fields. 
AFP correspondents said a cloud of dust covered Beirut’s port, while local media reported that two towers fell in the heavily damaged silos’ northern section, where a fire has been burning for more than two weeks. 
Footage of the incident showed part of the silo crumbling and a large cloud billowing up after debris hit the ground. 

US envoy arrives to push talks between Lebanon and Israel over maritime border dispute

The structure had absorbed much of the impact of the devastating explosion on August 4, 2020 at Beirut’s port that killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,500. 
The silos shielded large swaths of the city’s west from the devastating effects of the blast, which was caused by haphazardly stored ammonium nitrate fertiliser catching fire. 
Sunday’s partial collapse came around two weeks after a fire erupted in the port’s northern silos due to the fermentation of remaining grain stocks along with soaring summer temperatures, according to authorities. 
Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister this week warned they could fall. 
“The northern group of silos are now in danger of falling,” Najib Mikati said on Wednesday in a statement, which added that the silos still contained thousands of tonnes of wheat and corn. 
He told the army to be prepared and warned workers, civil defence members and firefighters to keep a safe distance from the site. 
Once boasting a capacity of more than 100,000 tonnes, an imposing 48-metre high remnant of the silos has become emblematic of the catastrophic port blast. 
The Lebanese investigation into the blast has faced systematic and blatant political obstruction from day one. 
Authorities were unable to unload around 3,000 tonnes of wheat and corn stuck in the silos because doing so might accelerate their collapse, this week’s statement said. 
The environment and health ministries advised the public to evacuate the port area and use masks in the vicinity of the silos in case they collapsed.
Maritime border dispute 
Hochstein met with Lebanon’s Energy Minister Walid Fayad on Sunday, and was scheduled to meet with President Michel Aoun and prime minister Najib Mikati the following day. 
“Reaching a resolution is both necessary and possible, but can only be done through negotiations and diplomacy,” the US State Department said in a statement ahead of Hochstein’s visit. 
Washington’s envoy for global infrastructure and investment is “facilitating negotiations between Lebanon and Israel on the maritime boundary”, the statement added. 
The maritime border dispute between Lebanon and Israel escalated in early June, after Israel moved a production vessel to the Karish offshore field, which is partly claimed by Lebanon. 
The move prompted Beirut to call for the resumption of US-mediated negotiations on the demarcation dispute. 
Lebanon and Israel have no diplomatic relations and are separated by a UN-patrolled border. 
They had resumed maritime border negotiations in 2020 but the process was stalled by Beirut’s claim that the map used by the United Nations in the talks needed modifying. 
Lebanon initially demanded 860 square kilometres of territory in the disputed maritime area but then asked for an additional 1,430 square kilometres, including part of the Karish field. 
Israel claims that the field lies in its waters and is not part of the disputed area subject to ongoing negotiations. 
On July 2, Israel said it had downed three drones launched by Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah that were headed towards the gas field. 
The powerful Shia Muslim movement on Sunday released a short video it said showed surveillance of several Israeli-chartered energy infrastructure ships, including the production vessel sent to Karish which is operated by London-listed firm Energean.
