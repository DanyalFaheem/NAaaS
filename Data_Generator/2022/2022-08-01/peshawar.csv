“For the upcoming academic year beginning from August 15, we have set a target to enrol one million out-of-school children in the public sector schools,” Minister for Education Shahram Tarakai told Dawn.
He said that the campaign had been designed in such a way that it would continue simultaneously at provincial, district, tehsil and village and neighbourhood council levels. He added that all out efforts would be made to bring maximum out-of-school children to the educational institutions.
The minister said that besides officials of the education department, local elders, senior students, parents-teachers council members, scouts and school heads would be engaged in door-to-door admission campaigns aimed at reaching to every child.

Drive starting today will be held simultaneously at provincial, district, tehsil, village and neighbourhood council levels

He said that it was the duty of every citizen of the province to participate in the campaign and enrol the children deprived of education in their area.
Regarding educational facilities, the minister said that government had been providing free textbooks, excellent educational facilities and competent teachers to the students. He appealed to the people to fulfil their responsibility by enrolling children in schools.
In the month-long campaign, students will be enrolled in the first shift as well as in the second shift of schools so that the children working in the first shift can also get an opportunity to study.
“This year, the entire admission campaign has been digitised for which the education department has created an App. Everyone can find all the details of the newly enrolled children online on the dashboard,” said the minister.
The secretary of elementary and secondary education department, Mutasim Billah, told Dawn that the department chalked out a different strategy as compared to the previous enrolment campaigns. “I have directed all the headmasters and schoolteachers to identify out-of-school children in their respective areas and ensure their enrolment,” he said.
He said that directives were also issued to the schoolteachers and members of the parent-teacher councils to hold meetings with the parents in the hujras and mosques to convince them to enrol their children in the schools.
“Those out-of-school children, who are earning for their poor parents by working as labourers, would be enrolled in the second shift of the schools,” said the education secretary.
He said that if the facility of second shift was not available in some areas, then education department would launch the second shift in the government schools there. He added that the department would not compromise on the education of the out-of-school children.
The secretary said that officials of the education department at district level, district administration and Education Monitoring Authority were also tasked to check regularly the enrolled students.
He said that headmasters of the schools would be accountable for the drop out of a student. He added that it would help in reducing the dropout rate in the government schools.
To encourage enrolment in the tribal districts, the secretary said, the students there would be given monthly stipend from Rs1,500 to Rs4,000 from primary to middle classes. “The government has allocated Rs500 million for the purpose,” he added.

Zeenat Khan

 
PESHAWAR: A young woman rights activist has recently earned an international award for producing a short film titled ‘She stood against religious extremism’ for the year 2022, sponsored by US-based organisation ‘Empowerment Women Media’ (EWM).
It was the fifth annual event conducted under the EWM. The winning short film will be screened at the International Religious Freedom (IRF) summit in Washington DC in October this year.
Zeenat Khan, a resident of Malakand, was given cash prize of $3,000 in a ceremony held recently in Islamabad for participating in the ‘Women Empowerment and Religious Freedom Film competition’. She has been working on women rights and interfaith harmony for the last 12 years. She is also the founder of Gender Lens, a youth forum for women rights.
“Young women can make effective use of digital media to bring about a substantive societal change. Women and children are mostly victims of violence. They should come forward to contribute positively to society by promoting interfaith harmony,” she told this scribe.

Zeenat Khan’s film will be screened in Washington in October

Zeenat Khan said after doing Masters in journalism more than a decade ago from University of Peshawar, she decided to utilise her skills for addressing social issues related to interfaith, youth and religious minorities. It was an uphill task but she embarked upon the journey despite family restrictions.
After having settled in Peshawar, she said that she initiated a project to launch a dialogue between different religious communities to reconnect them for a peaceful community life as it was before. She said that she came to know that before the wave of militancy and extremism in the city and elsewhere in the country, religious minorities used to live a peaceful life.
“Extremism bred hatred among communities to the extent that they stopped to attend festivals arranged by next door neighbor. Mutual respect and love were replaced by hatred and animosity. I floated the idea of telling a story that should showcase the situation and it was approved by the jurists,” said Ms Khan.
Her short film is based on a true story of a young woman in a war-stricken region of Pakistan who initiates a dialogue by approaching every single religious community and holds sessions with youth and convinced them to work for peaceful coexistence.
“The remarks of EWM executive director and author of ‘The Muslims Next Door’ Shirin Taber about my short film that we were amazed to witness the creativity of Pakistani women filmmakers, such films have the potential to change the lives, mean a lot for me,” she said.
Ms Khan said that the basic theme of the short film was to promote interfaith harmony and counter sectarian violence through dialogue where influencers and youth were engaged in a friendly manner.

The additional district and sessions judge, Shahid Mahmood, ruled that the prosecution failed to prove its case against the four suspects including Shah Saud, his brother Khalid and two sisters Aisha Noor and Fatima Gul as the evidence on record did not connect them with the commission of the offence.
The suspects were arrested in a special joint raid by Narcotics Eradication Team (NET) and personnel of Paharipura police station on August 9, 2021, on their residence situated at Corporation Colony, Dalazak Road.

Suspects including two brothers and two sisters were arrested in 2021

The raiding team claimed of recovering three kilograms of ice and five kilograms of heroin. It was alleged that the raiding team had found the four suspects engaged in making small packets of contrabands while sitting at the courtyard of their residence at the time of the raid.
The case was registered at Paharipura police station under section 9-D and 11-C of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Control of Narcotics Substance Act.
Advocate Shabbir Hussain Gigyani appeared for the petitioners and contended that his clients were implicated in a concocted case.
He argued that a police post was adjacent to the residence of the accused persons and there was also a watch tower there overlooking the house. He questioned how it was possible that the accused persons would be making packets of contraband at their courtyard, which was visible from the police post.
The counsel stated that in past the said police post was a residence, whose occupants were involved in some anti-social activities against which the present accused had also filed complaints. He added that even some police officials were frequent visitors to that residence.
Later on, he stated that the police sealed that residence and then set up police post there.
The counsel pointed out the raiding team claimed that some elders of the area accompanied it while raiding the residence, but on record names of none of the elders were given.
He argued that it was mandatory under the law to associate some persons of the locality during a raid and not following the said provision amounted to an offence punishable up to three years imprisonment.
The counsel stated that no elder of the locality was associated at the time of raid.
