6,Service tribunal suspends transfer of health officer,Issues notices to govt officials over plea of Dr Sahib Gul,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal has suspended the notification of the health department for the transfer of the Provincial 
Health Services Academy director-general on the charge of passing ‘derogatory’ comments against a former prime minister in a social media messaging group.
Tribunal chairman Kalim Arshad Khan admitted to full hearing the service appeal filed by senior officer of the health department’s management cadre, Dr Sahib Gul, challenging the impugned notification issued on Sept 19, 2022, for his transfer.
The bench fixed Jan 11 for the next hearing into the plea and issued notices to the respondents, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary, provincial health secretary, the director general (health services) and the relevant section officer of the department.

Issues notices to govt officials over plea of Dr Sahib Gul

The appellant’s counsel, Qazi Jawad Ahsanullah, insisted that contents of the impugned order showed that the same could not be termed to be an order passed in the public interest and, so the court should issue interim injunctions in favour of his client.
The tribunal directed authorities to suspend action on the Sept 19, 2022, order until the next hearing.
The appellant, a BPS-20 officer, was appointed against the post of Provincial health Services Academy’s director general on Aug 19 through a notification issued by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health secretary.
After a month, the secretary health issued another notification on Sept 19 whereby Dr Sahib Gul was transferred and directed to report to the directorate-general (health services).
The notification said the DG had shared messages of derogatory and defamatory nature against the former prime minister and his family by using his personal number.
It added that he had transmitted messages in a WhatsApp group titled “Management Cadre Association” vilifying the former prime minister.
While the name of the former prime minister was not mentioned in the notification, some officials claimed that the comments were against PTI chief Imran Khan.
The impugned notification was earlier challenged by Dr Sahib Gul before the Peshawar High Court, but his plea was rejected on Sept 22 because of the bar placed on the high court under Article 212 of the Constitution not to entertain any petition in matters of terms and conditions of service.
The appellant’s counsel stated that his client had filed a departmental appeal/ review petition on Sep 20, but despite passage of 90 days he had not received any response.
The counsel contended that his client had an unblemished and spotless service record and his service tenure was spread over a period of more than three decades in the provincial civil services.
He contended that false allegations were levelled against the appellant in the impugned order, which showed that the order was based on mala fide.
The lawyer contended that the case was not of ordinary nature and it was actually a case where a civil servant was being harassed and humiliated for political point scoring only and thus his fundamental rights provided in the constitution had been violated.
He added that the appellant had been condemned unheard as no inquiry, investigation had been conducted prior to issuance of the impugned order.

The chairman of the All Pakistan Clerks Association and employees association, Sakhi Badshah of Kohat TMA, said that the Water Supply and Sanitation Company (WSSC) was paid salaries and pensions from their account. He said the TMA should discontinue the payment of salaries to the workers sent on deputation to WSSC, which had ample resources to take the burden. He said that they had been told that they would not be paid the promised amount in December. 
Sakhi Badshah resented that the TMA owned billion worth of plazas, markets and shops, but had leased out the property by charging old rates of Rs5,000 against the market rate of Rs40,000 to Rs60,000 for shops depending on the location. He alleged that the bribes went from top to bottom. 
He suggested that a high-level inquiry should be conducted into a racket where a single person had been given three shops and was paying Rs15,000 to the TMA.
