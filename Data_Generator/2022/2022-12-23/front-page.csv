• Asks Elahi to stay until successor appointed
• Terming order ‘illegal’, Elahi vows to move court
• Fawad says reference to be sent to president for governor’s ouster
LAHORE: Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman sprang into action late on Thursday night and denotified Chaudhry Parvez Elahi as chief minister of the largest province in a bid to forestall ousted premier Imran Khan’s plan to dissolve the Punjab Assembly.
The development was immediately described as ‘illegal’ by Mr Elahi, who said he would move the court against the governor’s order on Friday (today).
PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry also termed the governor’s order illegal and said that “a selected governor has denotified an elected chief minister”.
Punjab Chief Secretary Abdullah Sumbal, who was appointed by the federal government on Wednesday, issued a notification in line with the governor’s order.
 
 

After the governor and the chief secretary’s notifications, Mr Elahi called an emergency meeting at his residence in which the advocate general of Punjab, Speaker Sibtain Khan, Moonis Elahi, Law Minister Basharat Raja and some other senior leaders were present to finalise Friday’s strategy.
In his order dated Dec 22, the governor said that since the chief minister had refrained from taking a vote of confidence at the appo­i­nted day and time, he ceased to hold the office.
He, however, asked Mr Elahi to continue working as chief minister until his successor takes charge.
Fawad Chaudhry tweeted that there was “no legal status of the governor’s order de-notifying CM Parvez Elahi. Mr Elahi and his cabinet will continue to perform their duties. A reference against the governor will be sent to the president for his ouster”.
 






Sources said the governor was given the go-ahead to denotify Mr Elahi following the failure of PPP senior leader Asif Ali Zardari and PML-Q president Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain to woo the PTI and PML-Q lawmakers in Punjab.
The governor in the order said: “Consequent to the facts that Ch. Parvez Elahi … refrained from obtaining the vote of confidence at 1600 hours yesterday (Wednesday), in line with an order under Article 130(7) of the Constitution … issued under my hand on Dec 19, 2022, in line with Rule 22(7) of the Rules of Procedure of provincial assembly of Punjab, 1997, and that he still has not done so even after the lapse of another 24 hours, I am satisfied that he does not command the confidence of the majority of the members of the Punjab Assembly, and therefore ceases to hold his office with immediate effect.”
As a result, “the provincial cabinet stands dissolved forthwith”, he said.
In terms of Article 133 of the Constitution, Mr Elahi, “former Punjab CM, is hereby asked to continue to hold office until his successor enters upon the office of the chief minister”, the governor said.
However, it remains to be seen whether the governor’s late-night order will hold the field or not.
Earlier in the day, the constituent parties of the ruling coalition in the Centre engaged in a lengthy huddle to decide whether Governor Rehman should be given the go-ahead to denotify Mr Elahi right away or wait till the PTI and PML-Q make their move in the face of the governor’s directive to the chief executive to seek a vote of confidence.
The coalition parties were of the view that they should stick to having the governor’s order implemented by forcing the chief minister to seek a vote of confidence.
Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, federal minister of the PML-Q (Shujaat group) Tariq Bashir Cheema, PPP Sindh Minister Nasir Hussain Shah and PM’s Special Assistant Malik Ahmad Khan were present in the meeting. Governor Rehman and the PML-N leaders also held separate meetings with legal experts in this regard.
Zardari’s efforts fail
“The PML-N and PPP are in no mood to push for their no-confidence motion against the chief minister in the Punjab Assembly,” a PML-N insider told Dawn after the meeting. “The motion was only filed to stop the CM from dissolving the assembly. At present, we don’t have the 186 votes required to oust the chief minister, and efforts of PPP’s Asif Ali Zardari to coax at least six PML-Q lawmakers have yet to bear fruit, rather he has failed. If the PA speaker adopts the no-trust motion, the PMLN and PPP are not ready to go for it.”
PM’s Special Assistant Attaullah Tarar told a private TV channel that after the expiry of the governor’s deadline to Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan, the governor had decided to give some “more time” to him to implement the order regarding CM Elahi’s vote of confidence.
“As this matter eventually has to land in court, the governor was observing caution. Earlier, 48 hours were given to the speaker to execute the order. As the speaker did not ask CM Elahi to take a vote of confidence till Thursday, the governor decided to issue an order denotifying the chief minister.”
 
 

The Punjab Assembly’s ongoing session will be held on Friday (today). Speaker Sibtain Khan on Tuesday had disposed of the governor’s order for CM Elahi to obtain a vote of confidence from the house, terming it “against the Constitution and Rules of Procedure”.
Talking to reporters outside the Governor House earlier, Rana Sanaullah said Mr Elahi had “constitutionally” ceased to be the chief minister after skipping the vote of confidence.
“CM Elahi now cannot advise dissolution of the Punjab Assembly after he did not obtain a vote of confidence on the governor’s order. I think the governor’s order to denotify Mr Elahi is just a formality now,” he remarked.
Hamza’s ‘mysterious’ absence
As the PML-N and PPP are busy making moves in Punjab to stop the provincial assembly’s dissolution, the opposition leader in the house, Hamza Shehbaz, is conspicuous by his absence. He travelled to London over a week ago and is expressing no interest in the province his party once ruled.
Since his defeat at the hands of Mr Elahi in the chief minister’s election in July, Hamza has been away from any party activity. Speculations are rife within the party that “he is being cut to size” regarding PML-N affairs by his cousin Maryam Nawaz or that his brother Suleman Shehbaz, who returned home after four years in self-exile, may be given a role in the party in the coming days.
If his wings aren’t being ‘clipped’, questions are being raised over the opposition leader’s ‘lack of seriousness’ in such a crucial time for the party in its bastion of Punjab.

1,Dissolution of  Punjab and KP assemblies ‘stalled’,"Speaker says no-trust motions against CM, speaker, deputy speaker to be decided by Jan 1, 2023","LAHORE: Imran Khan’s announcement that Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies will be dissolved on Friday (today) is far from turning into a reality as recent developments pushed any such action to at least two weeks away.
Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan effectively maintains the dissolution has been put on hold till they get the vote of confidence out of their way.
The KP assembly is also not going to be dissolved, at least on Friday.
Though KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan on Thursday said he would dissolve the assembly the “moment” Imran Khan asked him to do so, PTI insiders told Dawn the legislature would undergo such an action only after the Punjab Assembly was sent packing.

Speaker says no-trust motions against CM, speaker, deputy speaker to be decided by Jan 1, 2023

Earlier in the day, Speaker Sibtain Khan had confirmed that the no-confidence motions moved against the chief minister, speaker and deputy speaker would be decided by Jan 1, 2023. He also wrote a letter to the governor that as per his ruling his (the governor’s) asking the chief minister to take a vote of confidence was against facts because the session of the house summoned by the governor was unconstitutional under Article 209-A of the Punjab Assembly’s Rules of Procedure.
‘Constitutional right’
Earlier, PTI chief Imran Khan on Thursday censured the PDM government for turning its challenge to him to dissolve the provincial assemblies into a complete farce by blocking the “constitutional process” through no-trust vote moves.
“It is our constitutional right to dissolve our governments in Punjab and KP to move forward for fresh general elections, but the scared federal government is taking measures to save ‘our assemblies’,” he stressed, and termed the federal government’s threats to impose Governor Rule or de-notify the chief minister sheer “absurdity”.
Asking the state institutions, including the military establishment and judiciary, whether they were concerned about the country’s well-being, Mr Khan said Pakistan was drowning in crises and time was not far when it would get out of hand.
“Free and fair elections are the only way to restore economic stability through political stability,” he said while speaking to his party’s parliamentarians, workers and supporters, who had gathered on his call outside the Governor House to keep Governor Balighur Rehman from taking any “unconstitutional” action of de-notifying Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi.
The PTI workers and supporters, who had also brought along a 100-metre-long PTI flag, chanted slogans against the governor.
Eight months ago, Mr Khan said, “one man” decided to eliminate him and his party through all kinds of aggressive measures, and went on to say the person did to the country what even an enemy could not do.
“The country was progressing on all fronts by leaps and bounds when the person toppled the PTI government and installed thieves and looters and allowed them to get all their corruption cases cleared,” he regretted.
Although the PTI chief had been directly castigating retired Gen Qamar Bajwa, sources in the PML-Q told Dawn that Mr Khan did not name the former army chief as CM Elahi had taken strong exception to accusing the “benefactor” of both the PTI and PML-Q.
The former prime minister said the country’s economy was at its lowest ebb, political stability shattered and terrorism from across Afghanistan on the rise. “Where is the foreign policy?” he asked and chided Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for allegedly spending Rs1.75 billion on his foreign tours instead of going to Afghanistan to improve relations and control the cross-border attacks.
He stressed the federal government should invest in tribal areas to create jobs as a first step to bringing peace to the region. He also chided the federal government for not giving due shares of funds to Punjab, KP and Kashmir governments.
The PTI chairman also lambasted the elements releasing indecent audios and videos on social media to blackmail him, and regretted that the leaked clips were accessible to “our children”.
Governor’s powers
Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan, meanwhile, asserted that the governor did not have the powers to de-notify the chief minister even if the assembly was not in session.
He told the media that the Constitution did not have any provision that empowered a governor to do so.

2,NA approves bill seeking LG polls delay in Islamabad,Bill seeks to increase number of UCs from 101 to 125; passed with house visibly lacking quorum throughout the proceedings.,"ISLAMABAD: In a frantic attempt to get the local government (LG) polls in the federal capital delayed, the National Assembly on Thu­rsday passed a government bill seeking to increase the number of union councils from 101 to 125.
The move comes less than 10 days ahead of the polling day, December 31, and the bill was passed with the house visibly lacking quorum throughout the proceedings which lasted less than 40 minutes.
A lawmaker even asked if the house was in order and Speaker Raja Pervaiz Ash­raf replied in the affirmative without ordering a count.
Against the required strength of 86 for the quorum, 54 lawmakers were present in the house at the start of the session and just 43 at the end, according to a fact-sheet prepared by the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen).
Rules were suspended to allow taking up for consideration at once the Islam­abad Capital Territory Loc­al Government Amendment Bill introduced by Minister of State for Law Shahadat Awan on behalf of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah.
PTI dissident Ramesh Kumar Vankwani again tried to point out the lack of quorum when the bill was being moved, but his voice was simply ignored by the speaker.
Before the controversial bill was put to vote, Maulana Akbar Chitrali of Jamaat-i-Islami raised questions over the last-minute decision to amend the law a little over a week before the polls scheduled for December 31.
He said the transfer of power to grassroots level was a constitutional obligation and the only way to efficiently serve the masses. He regretted that the Constitution had been made a toy and fiddling with it had become a custom for the rulers.
He said the move meant to get the LG polls in the capital delayed was unconstitutional and recorded his strong protest over it.
PTI dissident Ramesh Kumar Vankwani also criticised the summoning of the National Assembly for a single day exclusively for approving the controversial bill. Claiming that the daylong session cost the national kitty Rs50 million, he asked the government why it was trying to escape elections.
Sabir Qaim Khani of MQM-P supported the bill and called for fresh delimitation of constituencies for LG polls in Sindh as well.
“How can the people be served when delimitation is not proportionate to population,” he asked.
The house also passed Federal Employees Benevolent Fund and Group Insurance Amendment Bill. The bill was moved by Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Javed Abbasi.
Commenting on the development, a senior official of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) told Dawn that the ECP would stick to its position as it was committed to holding local government elections as per schedule. He said amendments to an act could not override constitutional provisions.
He said all steps for electoral exercise, including filing and scrutiny of nomination papers, decision by Appellate Tribunals, finalisation of candidates, allotment of symbols, announcement of polling scheme, appointment and training of polling staff and printing of ballot papers had been completed and the stage was now set for holding LG polls.
He said as the ECP pointed out in its order dated December 20, the federal government increased the number of union councils from 101 to 125 without concurrence of the Election Commission as required under Section-4(4) of the ICT Local Government Act, 2015.
The section reads: “The Government may, with the concurrence of the Election Commission, alter the limits of a local area under this section after the initiation of proceedings of delimitation of constituencies by the Election Commission, but the Government shall not alter the limits of a local area after the announcement of election schedule for election in local area.”
He said the move to amend the bill at this stage was not only immoral and mala fide, but illegal as well.
Amendments to LG law
Increase in the number of union councils and provision for direct election for offices of mayor and deputy mayor are key features of the LG amendment bill passed by the National Assembly.
Section 6 (1) of the Islamabad Capital Territory law in its amended form reads: “There shall be one hundred and twenty-five Union Councils within the Islamabad Capital Territory under this Act. The Federal Government on the recommendations of Ministry of Interior by notification in the official Gazette may increase or decrease the number of union councils from time to time.”
Likewise, the substituted section 12(3) reads: “The Mayor and the Deputy Mayor shall be directly elected as joint candidates by the voters. The election of the Mayor and the Deputy Mayor shall be held on the day of election of members of Union Council under section 11.”

3,Rs1bn ‘New Year gift’ for govt employees unveiled,"Govt finalises “special dispensation package” for its civilian employees in grades 1 to 16, who have been protesting for pay raise.","ISLAMABAD: The government has finalised a “special dispensation package” for its civilian employees in grades 1 to 16, who have been protesting for an increase in salaries, citing inflation and alleged discrimination.
The package, involving an additional annual impact of around Rs1 billion and finalised by the finance ministry after negotiations with the All-Government Employees Grand Alliance (AGEGA), has been submitted to the prime minister for approval before a formal notification.
The package, which is on the pattern of a similar dispensation given to employees of the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa government, will come into force on Jan 1.
To be announced as a “New Year gift” to the non-gazetted employees, the package will not apply to employees paid out of the defence budget and will cost just Rs500 million during the remaining fiscal year, which ends in June.
These employees, thro­ugh their numerous unions and representative bodies, have been agitating for improvement in the service structure of their cadres along with financial amelioration.
Most demands presented by these employees and organisations were based on seeking parity with the benefits that have been granted in the provincial governments.
The main demands included the upgradation for the post of the lower division clerk (LDC) from basic pay scale (BPS) 9 to 11 and the upper division clerk (UDC) from BPS 11 to 14, besides grant of higher pay scale along the lines of those authorised by the KP government, i.e. two high pay scales to employees in BPS-1 to 5 and one high pay scale to those in BPS-6 to 15.
During the four-year PTI government that ended in April, an agreement was concluded between the AGEGA and the ministers for defence, interior and parliamentary affairs that included the upgradation of posts on the pattern of the KP government.
All demands decided under that agreement were met except those related to upgradation, giving cause to continuous unrest and agitation among the employees.
The finance ministry and the establishment division, the government’s human resource arm, re-engaged the protesting representatives of the employees’ alliance and reached a mutually acceptable ground on the analogy of the KP government.
Under the finalised package, the employees in BPS 1 to 5 will be granted two higher pay scales as a one-time dispensation if they have yet to avail timescale promotion (TSP) under the 2022 policy.
However, those in the same grade who have availed the promotion will be granted one higher pay scale as a one-time dispensation.
In BPS 6 to 15, employees who have not availed TSP 2022 will be granted the next higher pay scale as a one-time dispensation, whereas those who have availed the benefit will only be granted one additional increment of their current pay scale.
However, the substantive pay scales of all the above categories will remain unchanged. Also, employees in BPS 16 will be granted one additional increment as a one-time dispensation.
Moreover, the post of LDC will be upgraded from BPS 9 to BPS 11 and that of UDC from BPS 11 to 13, along with incumbents. The recruitment rules will be amended by the establishment division accordingly as per the upgradation policy.
However, these special dispensations will only apply to those civil servants of the federal government who are in BPS 1 to 16 (excluding employees paid out of defence estimates) and are in receipt of disparity reduction allowances.
Besides, one chance of granting a higher timescale, admissible under TSP 2022, will be considered lapsed for employees who avail of the benefit under this dispensation. This special dispensation will not involve any upgradation of the posts except the posts of UDC and LDC and no premature increment will be admissible on grant of the higher pay scale under this dispensation.
The beneficiary of the grant of a higher pay scale under this dispensation shall continue to draw allowances, perks, privileges, etc., sanctioned for the substantive pay scale of the beneficiary.
The substantive pay scale is one that a civil servant regularly acquires through initial appointment or by means of promotion or appointment by transfer.

4,Kabul renews pledge to curb cross-border terrorism: FO,"""We have received some assurances and have held some important consultations with the Afghan authorities,"" says FO spokesperson.","ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Thursday said Afghanistan’s de facto government has renewed its commitment to rein in cross-border terrorism and hoped that the Taliban administration would live up to its pledge.
“We have received some assurances and have held some important consultations with the Afghan authorities. We hope that the Afghan interim government will fulfil the commitments that it has made to Pakistan in terms of security,” FO spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said at the weekly media briefing.
 
 

The remarks, made in response to media questions, come against the backdrop of spate of recent terrorism incidents in the country, believed to have been planned and directed by the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) leaders based in Afghanistan, including the incident at the Counter-Terrorism Department’s interrogation facility in Bannu.
“We have certain mechani­sms with Afghanistan in which we engage to discuss these iss­ues. We will continue to engage with them to ensure that the Afg­han authorities fulfil the commitments that they have made to Pakistan that Afghan territory will not be used to des­t­a­bilise or to threaten Pakistan’s security,” she said.
Bannu stand-off underscored Pakistan’s resurgent terrorism problem. The TTP, which has ideological linkages with the Afghan Taliban, has executed around 115 attacks so far this year, most of which happened after August this year when the group’s peace talks with the Pakistan government began to falter. The ceasefire was formally ended last month by the TTP.
 
 

The group that has been involved in terrorism for 15 years and executed some of the deadliest attacks in the country’s history, including the one on Army Public School, Peshawar, in December 2014 had been weakened by successive counter-terrorism operations and many of its fighters and commanders fled to neighbouring Afghanistan.
Islamabad had been pressing successive governments in Kabul to take action against the TTP and other militants based in Afghanistan. While the previous governments turned a deaf ear to Pakistani pleadings, the Afghan Taliban persuaded Islamabad to hold peace talks with the militants.
 
 

The peace talks that began last year broke down twice and nothing substantive was achieved by Pakistan, but it helped the TTP secure release of some of its detained leaders, while allowing a large number of its Afghanistan-based fighters to relocate here.
TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud’s message in the middle of hostage crisis in Bannu this week left little doubt that the group’s leaders were directing terrorist attacks from their hideouts in Afghanistan.
“I congratulate you for carrying out this sacred act. I instruct you not to surrender to these infidels and apostates under any circumstances,” Mehsud said while addressing the hostage takers in Bannu in an audio message, according to VoA.
The FO spokesperson pointed to engagement with other count­r­ies as well on the issue of terrorism threat emanating from Afghanistan as she said: “We are engaged with international partners, including our neighbour Afghanistan, to ensure that terrorist groups do not threaten Pakistan’s security.”
Ms Baloch did not specify any particular international partner with which Pakistan is engaging on this particular terrorist threat.
Commander of US Central Command (Centcom) Gen Michael Kurilla, who visited Pakistan last week for meetings with the Pakistani military leadership, it should be recalled, toured Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, besides his meetings in Islamabad, to discuss the security situation along the border with Afghanistan.
Pakistan’s other major concern is the recent border incidents involving Taliban forces.
Ms Baloch, meanwhile, emphasised that despite these irritants Islamabad will remain engaged with the Taliban administration, which is still not internationally recognised.
“Pakistan prioritises dialogue and finding constructive solutions. That has always been our policy. We also want to find constructive solution to the current situation that we are facing, through dialogue,” she said.
