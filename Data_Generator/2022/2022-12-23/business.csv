2,Rice exporters seek cheap energy,ISLAMABAD: Expo­rters on Thursday asked the federal government to allow a subsidised power tariff of Rs19.99 and an...,"ISLAMABAD: Expo­rters on Thursday asked the federal government to allow a subsidised power tariff of Rs19.99 and an uninterrupted gas supply to rice mills to arrest the declining trend in export.
Pakistan’s rice ex­­ports dipped by 9.33 per cent to $749.40 million in July-November this year from $826.50m in the corresponding months of last year.
During a meeting with Commerce Secre­tary Muhammad Sualeh Ahmad Faruqui,  Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (Reap) Presi­dent Chela Ram Kew­lani warned that the export proceeds would fall below last year’s $2.5 billion if measures were not taken immediately.
He said that rice exports had the potential to reach $5bn in a couple of years if the sector gets the government’s facilitation.
Mr Kewlani said that Finance Minister Ishaq Dar’s claims of supporting exports remain on paper for sectors like rice. 
He alleged that the minister only facilitates big industries and has no soft corner for the rice sector. 
“We are not demanding subsidy for exports,” he said, adding finance minister or commerce minister has no time to listen to the problems of Pakistan’s second biggest commodity export sector.
Mr Kewlani said various issues including the declaration of industry status for the rice sector, subsidised tariff rates for rice mills and other matters related to rice export trade were discussed with the commerce secretary.
He deplored that Rs12bn under the Export Development Fund (EDF) was stuck with the government. 
“We dem­a­­nd the government to spend this amount on the rice growers to improve seeds and cultivation to increase yield,” he said. 
Addressing a press conference at National Press Club after the meeting, Mr Kewlani said containers were piling up at ports as businessmen were unable to open letters of credit due to shortage of dollars.
“The national economy is paying the price of persistent political instability,” he deplored.

4,"Arbitration platform for investors, brokers",Pakistan Stock Exchange says investors can resolve their trade-related disputes with stockbrokers thru PSX’s arbitration platform.,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) told investors on Thursday they can resolve their trade-related disputes with stockbrokers through the PSX’s arbitration platform, which is an independent panel of arbitrators.
It advised investors to opt for the out-of-court settlement of disagreements with brokers through the platform, which will consist of one PSX staff member, one broker (in advisory capacity) and two industry experts. The panel will listen to both sides and issue its decision or arbitration award within 90 days of the filing of the application.
Industry experts can be advocates, professional accountants or others with knowledge and experience in the fields of law, trade, commerce, industry, arbitration or the securities market.
According to PSX Chief Regulatory Officer Ajeet Kumar, investors can take any trade-, transaction- or subscription-related dispute with their brokers to the arbitration panel by filing an application to the Regulatory Affairs Division of the PSX.
After an investor (or broker) files an application for the dispute of over Rs500,000, a broker (in advisory capacity) and two industry experts will be selected through a ballot carried out in the presence of the parties concerned. A member from the senior management of the exchange will be nominated by the PSX.
The number of arbitrators to hear and decide the dispute depends on the disputed amount: a disputed amount of less than half a million will be referred to a sole arbitrator.
Any party dissatisfied with the decision of the arbitration panel may file an appeal to the chief regulatory officer of the exchange within 15 days. An appellate panel consisting of five arbitrators will hear and rule on the appeal within 45 days.

5,Stocks stage 495-point rally after super tax ruling,KARACHI: Bulls made a return to the Pakistan Stock Exchange at long last with share prices recovering on Thursday...,"KARACHI: Bulls made a return to the Pakistan Stock Exchange at long last with share prices recovering on Thursday some of the losses recorded earlier this week.
Arif Habib Ltd said bulls drove the KSE-100 index throughout the day on the back of a marked improvement in investors’ sentiments due to the reversal of the supertax by the Sindh High Court (SHC).
AKD Securities reported that the SHC judgment declared the retrospective application of super tax on 2021-22 ultra vires to the constitution. “While (it is) positive for companies, the decision is unlikely to bode well in a broader economic context given the difficult ongoing negotiations with the IMF,” it said.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 39,838.33 points, up 495.44 points or 1.26 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume increased 17.2pc to 194.5 million shares. The traded value went down 15.7pc to $24.4m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Cnergyico PK Ltd (17.4m shares), Pakistan Refinery Ltd (13m shares), TPL Properties Ltd (10.1m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (9.6m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (9.2m shares).
Sectors that contributed to the index performance were exploration and production (92.3 points), commercial banking (64.4 points), technology and communication (64.3 points), chemical (43.5 points) and cement (40.9 points).

6,Banks directed to speed up agri-financing,SBP asks banks to implement the Kissan Package in ‘letter and spirit’ to achieve the agriculture credit target of Rs1.8tr.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has asked banks to implement the Kissan Package in ‘letter and spirit’ to achieve the agriculture credit target of Rs1.8 trillion set for the current fiscal year.
The banks disbursed Rs664 billion agri loans in the first five months of 2022-23, which accounted for 36 per cent of the target.
Chairing the annual meeting of the Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee (ACAC) on Thursday, SBP Governor Jameel Ahmad referred to the devastation caused by recent floods and observed that climate change is the biggest threat to the country due to its unforeseen impacts.
“While the government, businesses and societies are recognising such threats, we need to take timely actions and allocate required resources for research and development of relevant products and services and capacity building of stakeholders to address them preemptively,” said the governor. 

Rs664bn farm loans disbursed in 5MFY23

He said that the government keeping the quantum of devastation in view has announced a comprehensive package for restructuring and rescheduling of agriculture loans, mark-up waiver for outstanding small loans in flood-hit areas, interest-free loans for subsistence and landless farmers and subsidised loans and risk-sharing scheme for farm mechanisation and other support measures. 
The SBP governor said that the package would facilitate the recovery of farmers from the impact of recent floods. He also assured SBP’s full support to the banks wherever needed.
However, due to huge losses to the agriculture sector banks feel the threat that aggressive lending could cause large defaults in the wake of the very slow recovery of the rural areas. 
The World Bank has approved a $1.7bn loan to support the recovery of farmers and farmlands in Sindh but the announcement would take time to realise the amount. 
The banks disbursed Rs1,419bn agri loans in FY22. 
This year heavy rains caused serious damage across the country, but Sindh was the worst-hit province. So far nothing has been done for capacity building of the flood-hit farmers and their lands. The Sindh government is under serious criticism over the situation since many agricultural lands are still under water.
The SBP governor also underlined that banks have a huge opportunity to exploit the untapped potential of Islamic agriculture financing for SBP’s commitment to transform conventional banking into Islamic banking in the next five years. 
He said that the share of Islamic financing in agriculture is still quite low and urged the industry to work on developing demand-driven Islamic financing products, specifically tailored to the requirements of the farming community.

7,S&P lowers Pakistan’s sovereign rating,"Downgrade reflects a continued weakening of external, fiscal and economic metrics","ISLAMABAD: Highlig­hting political unrest and continued weakening of external, fiscal and economic metrics, Standard & Poor’s on Thursday lowered Pakistan’s long-term sovereign rating to CCC+ from B-negative and anticipated a stable outlook.
“The outlook is stable”, said the New York-based rating agency saying it “lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on Pakistan to ‘CCC+’ from ‘B-’, and the short-term rating to ‘C’ from ‘B’ and also lowered long-term issue rating on Pakistan’s senior unsecured notes to ‘CCC+’ from ‘B-’.
The rating agency said the stable outlook reflected the balance of further risks to Pakistan’s external liquidity position and fiscal performance over the next 12 months against the prospect of additional support from multilateral and bilateral partners. On the downside, the S&P said it could further lower ratings if Pakistan’s external indicators deteriorate rapidly or fiscal deficits widen to exceed the domestic banking system’s financing capacity. One potential indication of domestic financing stress would be further increases in the government’s interest burden, estimated to exceed 40pc of government revenues in 2023.
Conversely, on the positive side, it said the ratings could be raised if Pakistan’s external and fiscal positions improve materially from current levels. Evidence of improvement could include a sustained rise in foreign exchange reserves, as well as a stabilisation of Pakistan’s debt service costs relative to revenues and a lengthening of debt maturities.

Downgrade reflects a continued weakening of external, fiscal and economic metrics

The agency explained that it lowered the ratings to reflect a continued weakening of Pakistan’s external, fiscal, and economic metrics. Given high gross external financing needs, and limited foreign exchange reserves, Pakistan’s balance of payments outlook remains vulnerable to energy price developments and the availability and timing of foreign support. “We expect the ratio of debt to GDP and budgetary deficits to remain elevated, with more than 40pc of government receipts used to finance interest payments, thereby reducing the government’s capacity to finance investment and social support”, it said.
It warned that Pakistan’s already low foreign exchange reserves would remain under pressure throughout 2023, barring a material decline in oil prices or a step-up in foreign assistance. A series of shocks — severe floods, surging food and energy inflation, and rising global interest rates — will lead to weaker economic and fiscal outcomes, and refinancing challenges over the medium term.
“Pakistan also faces elevated political risks, which may affect its policy trajectory over the next 12 months”, the S&P said. Severe flooding during the summer of 2022 has imposed additional hardships on households and businesses, further constraining growth.
Moreover, the Pakistani government is also facing fresh challenges in meeting the performance requirements of the IMF programme for subsequent reviews after completing eight reviews. Disbursements under the EFF, which began in July 2019, amount to approximately $4bn so far, including a $1.2bn allocation in August 2022.

8,Nano-loan apps deceiving users: CCP,CCP finds that several mobile apps offering nano loans indulge in deceptive marketing and collect users’ personal data.,"ISLAMABAD: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has found that several mobile apps offering nano loans don’t fulfil legal requirements, indulge in deceptive marketing and collect users’ personal data.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the commission said it had taken notice of the “various emerging concerns regarding mobile applications on Google Play Store offering nano/micro personal loans to vulnerable customers”, mostly belonging to the lower to middle-income class.
The CCP — mandated to protect consumers from anti-competitive practices, including deceptive marketing — said it conducted a preliminary investigation after reports appeared in the media about the practice found that several mobile apps were offering nano-loans without fulfilling the legal requirements of Non-Banking Micro Finance Companies’ (NBMFCs) law.
The NBMFC law offers a framework to regulate nano-loans only above Rs10,000, whereas most of these apps were offering smaller loans, it said, adding that these applications had more than 10 million downloads.
Its preliminary findings revealed, among other things, that these mobile apps had “contradictions between interest rate and processing fees charged from the borrowers versus the rates advertised”.
“There are also instances of faulty claims of data privacy and security, collecting personal data on the pretext of offering loans, the discrepancy in repayments, and the credit range advertised vis-a-vis those actually offered,” it said.
Based on the preliminary findings, the inquiry committee is authorised to thoroughly probe and submit an inquiry report to the commission with respect to any or all possible contraventions under the act against all nano-loan apps.

9,SBP reserves dip to $6.1bn,KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign exchange holdings dropped to an alarming level of just $6.1...,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign exchange holdings dropped to an alarming level of just $6.1 billion after an outflow of $584 million during the week ended Dec 16.
The central bank reported on Thursday that the reserves decreased due to external debt repayments. The repayment is becoming more difficult each day as the promised ‘inflows’ are not realised yet.
Pakistan has been requesting IMF for disbursement of the next tranche of $1.2bn, asking China to roll over $13bn loans and seeking $4bn from Saudi Arabia in addition to deferred oil payments. However, nothing concrete is visible and the dwindling SBP reserves reflected this alarming situation.
The IMF has delayed the 9th review under the $7bn Extended Fund Facility for two months after the PMLN-led coalition government failed to comply with the conditions set by the lending agency in the last review. 
The IMF is asking the government to impose new taxes of Rs800bn while the government is resisting it to avoid further damage to its political image. 
Experts are advising the government to impose more taxes on banks since the financial sector has been making huge profits but again the government is paying high interest on borrowing from banks. 
Banks have been investing maximum in risk-free government papers at a high rate of return of about 16pc, leaving no liquidity for the private sector, which is already depressed by the expensive cost of borrowing.
Furthermore, persistent political and economic instability has destroyed the exchange rate. The dollar rates in the interbank have been kept artificially low compared to the dollar prices in open and grey markets. The interbank dollar rate went up by 49 paise in the last four days to Rs225.43 on Thursday while the exchange companies reported the open market rate as 234.50. The grey market offers Rs255 plus for greenbacks 
The State Bank report showed that the country’s overall foreign exchange reserves fell to $12bn including $5.883bn of commercial banks during the week ended December 16.
