0,Sethi plans reforming domestic cricket through revival of departments,"“After four years, I have come again and there is a heavy workload,” says the head of the PCB management committee.","LAHORE: While Ramiz Raja stood sacked as Pakistan Cricket Board chairman on Thursday, former chief Najam Sethi as the head of a 14-member PCB Management Committee appointed by the prime minister categorically said the 2014 Constitution was restored and reforming domestic game through the revival of departmental and regional cricket was on the agenda.
“The cricket regime headed by Ramiz Raja is no more. The 2014 PCB constitution stands restored,” Sethi said on Twitter.

 





 
After four years and four months, Sethi again entered the Gaddafi Stadium on Thursday as the PCB head, this time for a four-month period to lead a 14-member committee — appointed by PM Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday —tasked with restoring the PCB 2014 Constitution, including revival of departmental cricket.
Sethi, a renowned professional journalist soon after joining the PCB on Thursday, talked to media along with some members of the Management Committee and a number of former office-bearers of different defunct regions.
“After four years, I have come again and there is a heavy workload,” the 74-year-old Sethi said while talking to reporters outside the Gaddafi Stadium.
Sethi, who was appointed PCB chairman in 2013 by then prime minister Nawaz Sharif remained in the Board as Pakistan Super League (PSL) chairman and PCB chief till Aug 20, 2018 when the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government led by prime minister Imran Khan came to power.
Sethi took some days before resigning from the post as PCB chairman, and hours later Imran Khan, as prime minister and patron-in-chief of the PCB, announced the name of Ehsan Mani as the next PCB chief. Mani after completing his three-year tenure stepped down in August last year leading to Ramiz’s election to the post of chairman a month later.
“First, I am thankful to prime minister [Shehbaz Sharif] who desires to restore the 2014 Constitution [of PCB], revive departmental cricket to end cricketers’ unemployment, bring back regional and club cricket and encourage private sector to come forward [for the game’s development],” he added.
“Much has been done [in Pakistan cricket] during the last four years, I will not comment on it. However, we will try to solve the problems faced by of our [present] national team players.”
Sethi categorically signalled the return of departmental cricket which was abolished under PCB’s 2019 Constitution promulgated during the previous government.
“We will try to make all the changes in the next three, four months time for reviving departmental cricket and to fully restore the Constitution of 2014,” he asserted.
“A Board [Board of Governors] having four departmental and as many regional representatives will be formed according to the PCB Constitution of 2014.
“The main agenda is also to improve domestic cricket through reforms to bring it at par with international level as we made the PSL an international brand,” Sethi said referring to the franchise-based league launched in 2016.
“In my previous tenure, the PSL took off successfully while the arrival of a number of foreign teams had also started, and it continues to this day.”
Sethi reckoned major reforms were required to improve Pakistan’s current domestic cricket which he said was not producing good-quality cricketers for the national team.
“[Comparatively] more players are emerging from the PSL platform,” he insisted.
About Pakistan’s upcoming home series against New Zealand, Sethi said the national Test squad had been announced a day before he joined the PCB, adding there were two options available to him in this regard.
“I don’t know making changes to the squad at this stage will be good or not; I will not take any more questions on this matter,” he said.
“It is better that some friends [members of the Management Committee] go to Karachi for the first Test. We hope the matches will be played in good atmosphere and Pakistan will perform better,” he added.
To a question about cricketing ties with India, Sethi said he had been reading different news reports about Pakistan-India cricketing relations and “The Management Committee will review Pakistan-India [bilateral] series matter to decide what message should be conveyed [to India],” he said. “In principle, any decision about the [revival of] Indo-Pak cricket relations has to be taken with the consent of the government.”
Asked if he expected any confrontation by Ramiz, Sethi said personally he did not believe in confrontation.
“In 2018, though I received a message from high-ups not to leave the position [of chairman] but I didn’t want to stand between Imran Khan’s vision, and therefore quit the post,” he said.
He said there was no red-flag in holding international cricket in Peshawar.
“The stadium in Peshawar is being renovated. It will complete in six months time, after which we will go to Peshawar, as I [during the previous regime] had done by organising international matches against West Indies in Karachi, which was not possible for many people at that time,” Sethi remarked.
While noting the prime minister had a big role in appointing PCB chairman, Sethi said there was no guarantee that a new chairman — in case of holding fresh elections — would be at the helm.
However, he said, performance should be important in bringing new PCB chief. “If this is not there, then people are right in asking for a change.”
Interestingly, when Sethi came to talk with the media, no PCB official, barring media department, accompanied him.
Several members of the newly-appointed Management Committee including Shakil Sheikh, Nauman Butt (both former members of the BoG), former Test cricketer Shafqat Rana, Gulzada, former Lahore City Cricket Association president Khawaja Nadeem, Faisalabad District Cricket Association secretary Rana Anis, and clubs’ owners Sarfaraz Ahmad, Shahbaz Ali and Ijaz Shah were prominent standing alongside Sethi during the presser.
Earlier, PCB chief executive Faisal Hasnain, chief operating officer Salman Naseer and other key officials welcomed Sethi upon his arrival at the Gaddafi Stadium.

KARACHI: New Zealand’s cricket team returned to Pakis­tan Thursday to play two Tests and three One-day Inter­nationals, a year after abandoning their tour over a security threat.
The arrival of the Kiwis comes just days after Eng­land whitewashed Pakistan at home in a three-match Test series. New Zealand sparked deep frustration in Pakistan in September last year when they failed to show up at Rawalpindi Stadium and announced they were flying home.
They rescheduled the visit after Australia’s successful tour in March, which was followed by two visits by England.
The current 15-man New Zealand squad is led by veteran fast bowler Tim Southee and they will begin the tour with the first Test in Karachi from Monday.
The second Test is in Multan from January 3, followed by ODIs on January 10, 12 and 14 in Karachi.
The Test series against New Zealand will provide Pakistan with a chance to improve on their performance after a humiliating defeat at the hands of England.
New Zealand cut short a tour in 2002 when a bomb blast outside their Karachi hotel killed 14 people including French naval staff. They returned in 2003 but avoided the mega port city.
Squad: Tim Southee (captain), Michael Bracewell, Tom Blundell, Devon Conway, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Ish Sodhi, Blair Tickner, Neil Wagner, Kane Williamson, Will Young.

2,"Argentina up to second in FIFA rankings, Morocco surge",Morocco are 11th after climbing 11 spots.,"ZURICH: Winning the World Cup was not enough to lift Argentina atop the FIFA world rankings with arch-rivals Brazil keeping the No. 1 position, the global governing body announced on Thursday.
Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Croatia but built enough rankings points from results over recent years that feed into FIFA’s calculation.
Argentina climbed one place to second and beaten finalists France also rose one to third, while the tournament’s surprise package Morocco were big movers and are on the verge of cracking the top 10.
Argentina skipper Lionel Messi scored two goals and netted again in the shootout as he led his country to an emotional 4-2 win on penalties over France on Sunday, with the title clash ending 3-3 after 120 minutes of breathtaking action.
A win in normal or extra time would have propelled Argentina to the top of the rankings but they sit second behind five-time world champions Brazil who now have a slender lead in points.
Belgium are still fourth, a fall of two places, despite winning only one game in Qatar and failing to advance from the group stage.
Morocco are 11th after climbing 11 spots, with the Atlas Lions the year’s highest climbers having earned 142 points over the previous 12 months.
They enjoyed a superb run to the semi-finals in Qatar before losing to Croatia in the third-place playoff and are now the highest-ranked team in Africa, ahead of Senegal (19th), Tunisia (30th) and Cameroon, who beat Brazil in the group stage to rise 10 places to be 33rd.
Croatia, the World Cup runners-up in Russia four years ago, are seventh from 12th behind England and the Netherlands.
European champions Italy are at eighth despite failing to qualify for the World Cup.
The United States at 13th are the best of the CONCACAF region teams, rising three places after advancing to the round of 16. Mexico are 15th.
Japan lead the Asian confederation teams at 20th, up four places after defeating Germany and Spain in their group stage, and Australia rise 11 places to No. 27. Both reached the round of 16.
It is Australia’s highest ranking since March 2012 when they were 20th, and best position to end a calendar year since 2011 (23).
“It’s obviously a reflection of what we’ve recently done [at the FIFA World Cup] and I guess a testament to another achievement by the team,” captain Mat Ryan said.
“We can be extremely proud of what we achieved. I don’t think people in Australia quite grasp the scale of what we did in terms of the qualifying process [for the FIFA World Cup] and playing the opposition we did.”
Australia will remain the fourth-highest AFC nation behind Japan, Iran (24) and South Korea (25) but will be well clear of fifth-ranked Saudi Arabia (48).
Qatar dropped 10 places to 60th after losing all three games as the home team at the World Cup.
The rankings will next be updated on April 6.

3,Cameron Green in a good space ahead of Boxing Day Test,Green says he has been working hard in training to keep sharp when called upon.,"MELBOURNE: Australia all-rounder Cameron Green conceded he has not made much of an impact recently with the team playing so well but he says he is in a “good space” and ready to play his part ahead of the ‘Boxing Day’ Test against South Africa in Melbourne.
Green did not bat in the first of Australia’s two Test wins over the West Indies earlier this month and scored just nine and five in the second match.
He then hit 18 off 19 balls in the first innings of Australia’s opening test against South Africa, and was scoreless in the second innings as the hosts wrapped up the win in just two days.
He bowled only 32 overs across the three Tests but took five catches in the field in their win over South Africa.
“It has definitely been a weird start to the summer for myself, not having to do too much,” Green told reporters. “Being the all-rounder you are kind of like the guy to help out if the team needs. At the moment it feels like I am not really needed in a way, but that is obviously a sign of how well we are playing.”
Green said he had been working hard in training to keep sharp when called upon.
“All you can look at is how you are training and I feel in a pretty good space,” he added. “I’m hitting the ball well. If you can’t get much game time that’s the only way you can tell how you are going. I feel pretty good in the nets.”

4,"Jofra Archer set for England return in South Africa ODIs, Brook earns maiden call-up","“Archer is recovering well from an elbow injury and is expected to return to international cricket next month,"" says ECB.","LONDON: England have named fast bowler Jofra Archer in their 14-man squad for the three-match One-Day International series in South Africa next month, while there is a first call-up in the 50-over format for in-form batsman Harry Brook.
Archer, who he has not played international cricket since March 2021 due to injury, has been signed by the Cape Town Indians Twenty20 franchise and will play in the SA20 league from early January, though the competition will break for a little over a week so as not to clash with England’s tour.
The Sussex pacer Archer made a dramatic entry onto the international stage in 2019 when he became one of the stars of England’s 50-over World Cup triumph.
The 27-year-old Barbados-born quick suffered several elbow problems, which led to two operations, before his hopes of a return to action were dashed by a stress fracture of the lower back in May that ruled him out of the 2022 English season.
Archer, however, played for the second-string England Lions in a warm-up match against the Test side in Abu Dhabi last month ahead of the senior team’s 3-0 whitewash of Pakistan.
An England and Wales Cricket Board statement issued on Thursday said Archer was “recovering well from an elbow injury and is expected to return to international cricket in South Africa next month”.
Meanwhile, rising star Brook, fresh from three superb Test hundreds in Pakistan and England’s T20 World Cup win in Australia, has been called into an ODI squad for the first time.
The 23-year-old has been a mainstay during an already busy England tour programme but team management have decided against resting him ahead of a Test series in New Zealand in February.
Outstanding batsman Joe Root and express fast bowler Mark Wood have though been left out, though, as England look to manage the workloads of their multi-format players.
Opener Ben Duckett, who played the last of his three ODIs in 2016, has been recalled to the 50-over set-up after regaining his England place at T20 and Test level in recent months.
Left-arm quick Reece Topley, unluckily ruled out of the T20 World Cup campaign after tripping on a boundary sponge, has also been included in a squad that will again be led by white-ball captain Jos Buttler.
But all-rounder Liam Livingstone has been ruled out with the knee injury he suffered on Test debut against Pakistan in Rawalpindi.
The three-match contest in South Africa is a rearranged series that was initially abandoned in December 2020 after a Covid-19 scare prompted England to fly home early.
It will be played over six days, with two fixtures in Bloemfontein starting on January 27 before the final game takes place in Kimberley on February 1.
Squad: Jos Buttler (Captain and wicket-keeper), Moeen Ali, Jofra Archer, Harry Brook, Sam Curran, Ben Duckett, Dawid Malan, Adil Rashid, Jason Roy, Phil Salt, Olly Stone, Reece Topley, David Willey, Chris Woakes.

INDIAN players celebrate the dismissal of Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan (L) during their second Test at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium on Thursday.—AFP

 
DHAKA: Umesh Yadav and Ravichandran Ashwin claimed four wickets apiece Thursday as India bowled out Bangladesh for 227 runs in their first innings of the second Test in Dhaka.
India, pressing for a 2-0 series sweep, finished the day on 19 for no loss with stand-in skipper K.L. Rahul (three) and Shubman Gill (14) seeing off the final eight overs.
Rahul had been given lbw to Shakib Al Hasan but the batsman reviewed the decision which was overturned after replays confirmed the ball would have missed the stumps.
Mominul Haque top-scored with 84 but the hosts lost wickets at regular intervals to end their innings about an hour before stumps after electing to bat first.
Umesh earlier picked up 4-25 and Ashwin grabbed 4-71 as India stopped Bangladesh from building a significant partnership, despite several batsmen getting decent starts.
“It’s a 50-50 wicket. It is not like it is fully for the pacers or spinners. Some balls are doing something and some are not,” Umesh said after the day’s play.
“You have to be patient. One odd ball is kicking from back of length, and if you bowl full it is not swinging or doing anything. There is no pace.”
On a day when several batsmen squandered starts, Mominul was the glorious exception who dug his heels in and kept the scoreboard ticking after Bangladesh lost both of their openers in the morning session.
India sprang a surprise by dropping spinner Kuldeep Yadav, whose match-haul of eight wickets in their comprehensive victory in Chittagong earned him the player-of-the-match award.
Jaydev Unadkat was picked instead and the left-arm seamer, playing in his second Test 12 years after his first, drew first blood by removing Zakir Hasan for 15.
Zakir, who smashed a century in his Test debut in Chittagong, could have been dismissed for a golden duck but Mohammed Siraj dropped him in the deep in the second over of the day.
Najmul Hossain (24) was trapped lbw by Ashwin after offering no shot to a ball which rapped him below the knee roll. Shakib (16) survived a stumping opportunity before lunch but could not capitalise on it and fell to the first ball after the break.
Mushfiqur Rahim (26) fell to Unadkat and Litton Das made a run-a-ball 25 before chipping an Ashwin delivery to Rahul at midwicket.
Bangladesh had scored 184-5 at the tea break and crumbled in the final session when Umesh bowled an incisive spell to claim three successive wickets.
The pacer dented the hosts’ lower order and Ashwin removed Mominul and Khaled Ahmed in the space of three balls as Bangladesh wilted in 74 overs.
Mominul, who relinquished the captaincy in May after overseeing a string of defeats, hit 12 fours and a six before his bizarre dismissal.
The number three batsman lunged forward but then decided to leave the ball from Ashwin which brushed his glove en route to Rishabh Pant behind the wicket. The spinner ended the Bangla­desh innings two balls later, with last man Khaled giving a catch to Unadkat at deep mid-wicket.—Agencies

6,United see off Burnley as Charlton stun Brighton,LONDON: Marcus Rashford marked his return from World Cup duty with a brilliant solo goal as Manchester United...,"

LONDON: Marcus Rashford marked his return from World Cup duty with a brilliant solo goal as Manchester United advanced into the quarter-finals of the League Cup on Wednesday with a 2-0 win over Burnley while third-tier Charlton Athletic knocked out Brighton & Hove Albion on penalties.
United’s first game since the World Cup was also their first since Cristiano Ronaldo’s dramatic departure from Old Trafford and an announcement by owners the Glazer family that they were prepared to sell the football giants.
The Red Devils went ahead in the 27th minute through a close-range finish from Denmark’s Christian Eriksen, who also featured at Qatar 2022.
Rashford, who scored three goals for England at the World Cup, doubled United’s lead against second-tier Championship leaders Burnley, managed by former Manchester City star Vincent Kompany, just before the hour mark in superb style.
The England forward went on a run from inside his own half and into the visitors’ box before drilling a shot low into the net.
“There is space in front of you and you’re almost waiting for the right time to get a pass off but the gap opened and thankfully it went in,” Rashford told Sky Sports.
This was Rashford’s first match since England’s agonising World Cup quarter-final loss to France, with the forward saying: “It was such a disappointing feeling to be knocked out and you have to pick yourselves up. There is no time to feel sorry for yourself. You need to pick up results and thankfully we did that today.”
United manager Erik ten Hag added: “There is still room for improvement but I am pleased with the win. The players are hungry after the World Cup break.”
Burnley boss Kompany was proud of his side’s performance, saying: “We didn’t roll over, we were aggressive, we were on front foot, we created some chances.”
Brighton bowed out on spot-kicks three days after their Argentina star Alexis Mac Allister won the World Cup with Argentina in a penalty shoot-out.
Mac Allister was not involved on Wednesday after being given time off following his World Cup heroics and was thus spared any involvement away to southeast London side Charlton.
A goalless draw saw the game go to penalties, with an extraordinary shoot-out starting with Pascal Gross, Jayden Stockley and Leandro Trossard all hitting the woodwork.
Brighton keeper Jason Steele saved from George Dobson and Jesurun Rak-Sakyi.
That left Solly March with the chance to win the game but the Seagulls star shot high over the crossbar.
Addicks goalkeeper Ashley Maynard-Brewer then saved Moises Caicedo’s penalty, with Sam Lavelle scoring the decisive goal at The Valley as League One Charlton booked their place in the quarter-finals with a 4-3 shoot-out win.
“I’m sorry for the result and sorry for our fans, we wanted to win the game and play in the quarter-finals,” said Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi. “We had opportunities to score. And in penalties you can lose.”
Charlton interim boss Anthony Hayes, in charge of his last match before Dean Holden, the club’s fifth manager in less than two years, takes over, said: “It was a special night. It gives everyone a lift.”
Four-times winners Nottingham Forest crushed Championship side Blackburn Rovers 4-1, striker Brennan Johnson giving the Premier League side an early lead from the penalty spot.
Blackburn equalised before halftime through defender Scott Wharton but Jesse Lingard restored Forest’s lead soon after the interval and Taiwo Awoniyi and Johnson completed the rout.

7,IOC raises prospect of boxing being pulled from Paris Games,LAUSANNE: The Inter­national Olympic Commi­ttee (IOC) on Thursday raised the possibility of boxing being excluded...,"LAUSANNE: The Inter­national Olympic Commi­ttee (IOC) on Thursday raised the possibility of boxing being excluded from the 2024 Paris Games, saying its Russian-led world body showed it had “no real interest” in the sport or its athletes.
The International Boxing Association (IBA) was stri­pped of involvement in the Tokyo Olympics and boxing is not on the initial progra­mme for the 2028 Los Ange­les Games, pending refo­rms demanded by the IOC.
Qualifying for the Paris 2024 boxing tournament is being organised by the IOC but it said that concerns regarding the IBA mean it will take further decisions that “may have to include the cancellation of boxing for the Olympic Games Paris”.
An IOC spokesperson said: “The recent IBA Cong­ress has shown once more that IBA has no real interest in the sport of boxing and the boxers, but is only interested in its own power.
“The decisions and discussions to keep boxers away from the Olympic qualifiers and the Olympic Games cannot be understood differently.”
The IBA is run by Russian Umar Kremlev with backing from Russian energy firm Gazprom. The IOC spokesperson said the IBA extending its deal with Gazprom recently showed it had “no will to understand the real issues”.
The spokesperson said the IOC’s concerns included the handling of the CAS decision.
“The IOC will have to take all this into consideration when it takes further decisions, which may — after these latest developments -- have to include the cancellation of boxing for the Olympic Games Paris 2024.”

8,Pele to spend Christmas in hospital as cancer advances,Pele has been hospitalised since late November as doctors reevaluate his treatment and tend to a respiratory infection.,"SAO PAULO: Brazilian football great Pele’s cancer has advanced and he requires care related to renal and cardiac dysfunction, according to a medical report, and his family said he would remain in a Sao Paulo hospital over Christmas.
Widely considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, the 82-year-old has been hospitalised in the Albert Einstein hospital since late November as doctors reevaluate his treatment and tend to a respiratory infection.
Pele has received regular medical treatment since a tumor was removed from his colon in September last year.
“Our Christmas at home has been suspended,” his daughters Kely Nascimento and Flavia Arantes said on Instagram, thanking people for their support. “We decided with the doctors that, for various reasons, it would be better for us to stay here with all the care that this new family at Einstein gives us,” she said in the post.
Accompanied by a picture of them smiling, the sisters thanked Pele’s fans for their support and wished them a happy festive season.
“We are going to turn this room into a Sambodrome [just kidding], we will even make caipirinhas [not kidding!!],” they joked, referencing Brazil’s famous cocktail.
The siblings promised an update next week.
Pele dazzled from an early age and took the 1958 World Cup by storm when he was 17 years old, netting a hat-trick in the semi-finals and two more goals in the final, catapulting his own career and launching the football dynasty of the Brazilian national team.
Pele scored more than 1,000 goals in one of the most storied careers in sport. He is the only player in history to have won three World Cups (1958, 1962 and 1970).
In recent years, the man dubbed “The King” has faced deteriorating health and his public appearances have grown rare.
He has dealt with his ailments with trademark good humor, remaining active on social media.
Following Argentina’s win in Sunday’s World Cup final, Pele posted a picture of their team lifting the trophy, and hailed performances from squad leader Lionel Messi, France’s rising star Kylian Mbappe, and surprise semi-finalists Morocco.
“Today, football continues to tell its story, as always, in an enthralling way,” he said. “What a gift it was to watch this spectacle of the future of our sport.”
Brazilian players had during a quarter-final in Qatar unfurled a massive banner on the pitch with an image of the football great during his 1970 World Cup win. It simply read: “Pele!”
World Cup host nation Qatar also showed its support for Pele, lighting up buildings with a “Get well soon” message.

9,Tokyo Games cost 20% more than reported,TOKYO: Last year’s pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics cost 20 per cent more than the final figure reported by the...,"TOKYO: Last year’s pandemic-delayed Tokyo Olympics cost 20 per cent more than the final figure reported by the organising committee, according to an analysis by Japan’s audit board.
A report issued late Wednesday found the Games cost 1.7 trillion yen ($12.9 billion), up from the 1.42 trillion yen reported by Tokyo 2020 earlier this year.
The audit board said organisers had incorrectly failed to include some Olympic-linked government spending on items including anti-doping measures, athlete training, Japanese food at the athletes village and the Olympic stadium.
And its report urged the government in the future to “reveal the total costs in a timely manner when it is substantially involved in a major event.”
The 2013 bid for the Tokyo Games estimated the event would cost just 734 billion yen, but costs gradually ballooned, with a pandemic postponement adding to the bill.
Asked about the costs Thursday, government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno told reporters “the government takes the points raised seriously and will respond appropriately”, without offering details.
The Games were held a year later than planned because of the pandemic — the first Olympics postponed in peacetime — and spectators were banned from nearly all events, which were held under strict Covid-19 countermeasures.

11,France planning AI-assisted control for Paris Olympics,PARIS: French authorities plan to use an AI-assisted crowd control system to monitor people during the 2024 Paris...,"PARIS: French authorities plan to use an AI-assisted crowd control system to monitor people during the 2024 Paris Olympics, according to a draft law seen by AFP on Thursday.
The system is intended to allow the security services to detect disturbances and potential problems more easily, but will not use facial recognition technology, the bill says.
The technology could be particularly useful during the highly ambitious open-air opening ceremony which is set to see Olympians sail down the river Seine in front of a giant crowd of 600,000 people.
French police and sports authorities faced severe criticism in May after shambolic scenes during the Champions League final in Paris when football fans were caught in a crowd crush and teargassed.
The draft law, which was presented to the cabinet on Thursday, proposes other security measures including the use of full-body scanners and increases the sentences for hooliganism.
Organisers and Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin have both argued in favour of using so-called “intelligent” security camera software that scans images for suspect or dangerous behaviour.
The use of such a system during the Olympics is an “experimentation”, the draft law says, but could be applied for future public events which face terrorism-related or crowd control risks.
“No biometric data is used, nor facial recognition technology and it does not enable any link or interconnection or automatic flagging with any other personal data system,” the bill states.
The games’ organising committee said on November 21 that it needed to lift its budget estimate by 10 per cent from 3.98 billion euros to 4.48bn euros, partly as a result of inflation.
Rather than opening the games in an athletics stadium as is customary, organisers have planned a ceremony on July 26, 2024 with a flotilla of some 200 boats sailing down the river Seine.
The banks of the river can accomodate 100,000 people who will have to buy tickets, while another 500,000 are set to watch for free from the street level, according to government estimates.

Former Jamaica wicket-keeper Coley is currently the coach of the Cricket West Indies (CWI) academy programme and was previously assistant for the senior men’s and women’s teams.
“I look forward to the tours ahead and the opportunity to make a tangible and meaningful contribution to the growth of West Indies cricket,” said the 48-year-old, who was assistant under Simmons when West Indies won their second T20 World Cup title in 2016.
West Indies will play two Tests against Zimbabwe at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo in February, before a multi-format tour of South Africa.

14,French minister wants FIFA probe as team targeted by insults,PARIS: The distasteful taunting of France striker Kylian Mbappe by some Argentina fans amid celebrations in Buenos...,"PARIS: The distasteful taunting of France striker Kylian Mbappe by some Argentina fans amid celebrations in Buenos Aires to welcome back the World Cup winners should be investigated by football’s world governing body FIFA, a senior French cabinet minister said.
During Argentina’s jubilant homecoming a group of fans set alight a makeshift coffin lid adorned with a cross and picture of Mbappe. Goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez also clutched a toy baby with Mbappe’s face on during an open-top bus parade through the capital. Images of both went viral on social media.
Meanwhile, France’s football federation and an anti-racism charity will file legal complaints against individuals who hurled racist insults at Mbappe and his team-mates on social media following the World Cup final defeat on penalties.
Asked for his reaction to the insults out of Argentina on social media, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Sud Radio the scenes were “undignified” and questioned openly whether FIFA should look into the events.
“What is FIFA doing? Sport is about fair play,” Le Maire said. “Its showing respect for others. It’s showing respect for those who lost.”
The Argentine Emba­ssy in Paris did not immediately res­pond to a request for comment.
Mbappe, who turned 24 on the day millions took to the streets in the Argentine capital to give a heroes welcome to team captain Lionel Messi, spearheaded a gutsy French comeback by scoring two goals in 90 seconds to force extra time.
He and other players of African descent, who form a majority of the France team, have received torrents of racist abuse from a small minority of supporters on social media.
SOS Racisme, an anti-racism association, has included screenshots of more than 100 hateful comments in a criminal complaint against those behind the remarks The French Football Federation has done the same.
“It is the expression of a far-right ideology that says that these people should not be considered French,” said Hermann Ebongue, secretary general of SOS Racisme.
He added that the two players who missed their penalties, King­sley Coman and Aurelien Tcho­uameni, received the most abuse and that some of the players had deactivated the comments on their social media accounts.
The maximum penalty for racist abuse online is one year in prison and a 45,000 euros ($47,839.50) fine.
SOS Racisme had already asked FIFA to take action against Argentina fans who sang a racist song about Mbappe and the France team before the start of the tournament and is studying images coming out of Argentina for any signs of racism.

Deschamps, 54, led Les Bleus to the World Cup final on Sunday, where they lost in a penalty shoot-out to Argentina, after guiding them to the trophy four years ago.
Deschamps, who captained the 1998 France team to their first World Cup title, will meet with Le Graet in the north-west town of Guingamp next week to discuss extending the ex-Juventus midfielder’s deal until Euro 2024.
“In my opinion we will settle it in Guingamp,” Le Graet told newspaper Ouest-France. “If he doesn’t want to stay, it will be short. If he wants to stay then there will be discussions that are a little longer. Didier has done his job well, I think we’ll come to an agreement.”
