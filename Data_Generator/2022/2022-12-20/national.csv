“A suicide blast occurred in the general area of Miramshah, North Wazir­istan District. Resultantly, Naik Abid, 33, a resident of district Mansehra, and two civilians embraced martyrdom while one civilian was injured in the incident,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in an official statement.

1,PM Shehbaz wants measures to reduce circular debt in energy sector,Orders that markets be closed by 8pm across Pakistan to save power and gas.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday directed authorities concerned to take steps  to reduce circular debt in the energy sector and decided to restrict market timings till 8pm to save energy.
In a meeting chaired by the prime minister on ener­­gy sector, its participants considered adoption of a comprehensive strategy to control the present circular debt in oil and gas sectors.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the prime minister said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government completely eradicated the circular debt during its 2013-2018 government tenure. He pledged to bring the problem of debt under control with continuous efforts and effective planning.
PM Sharif directed that reforms in the energy sector should be undertaken in a way that the circular debt could be eliminated.
“The distribution companies of Sui gas should improve the system of recovery of bills and no additional burden should be put on gas and electricity consumers,” the prime minister was quoted as saying.

Shehbaz orders markets closed by 8pm across Pakistan to save power and gas

He said the system for payment of bills of gas and electricity should also be made effective.
The meeting also reviewed the energy saving plan, which would be presented before the federal cabinet on Tuesday.
Chief ministers of the provinces have also been invited to the cabinet meeting to take them on board on the issue.
The prime minister said that the energy transmission system should be improved and losses and theft of electricity and gas should be stopped.
Media reports quoting the power division said that the circular debt which stood at Rs2.253 trillion by end of September last year had now reached Rs2.437 trillion, showing an increase of Rs185bn.
Market timings
In order to conserve electricity and gas, the government also decided to restrict timings of markets across the country till 8pm.
A government source told Dawn that the federal cabinet would meet on Tuesday to discuss the single-point agenda —implementation of energy conservation plan.
The source said the energy saving plan had been devised to stabilise economy, conserve energy and cut the import bill because the country faced an extraordinary situation and it required extraordinary measures.
The plan, prepared by Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, was approved at a high-level meeting, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday and the federal cabinet would give its final nod in consultations with provinces.
In the last meeting, all provincial governments had been asked to complete their homework regarding energy conservation plan including closing timings of markets till 8pm. 
Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb had said the plan would be presented in the next cabinet meeting for final approval and all chief ministers would be invited so that it could be implemented in collaboration with provincial governments.
Under the plan, a crackdown on electricity theft would be launched and many private and government buildings would be converted to solar energy.
The main purpose of the emergency energy saving plan is to reduce the pressure on people and the economy as the prices of oil and gas have continued to rise in the global market.
It is expected that the energy conservation plan will save billions of dollars annually that would help stabilise the economy and save the precious foreign exchange.
Arab digital media
Meanwhile, Prime Mini­s­ter Shehbaz Sharif has ap­­pointed Dr Talha Muham­mad Younis Al Kashmiri as the coordinator of the prime minister for Arab Digital Media while Mr Waqas Mehmood has been appointed as coordinator of the PM for digital media.
Both the appointments have been made by the prime minister on honorary basis.

2,KP CTD suffers from ‘capacity gaps’: report,"Report says province's CTD spends less than 4pc of its budget on operations, with zero allocation for procurement.","ISLAMABAD: At a time when terrorism is rearing its head in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a critical report by an intelligence agency has highlighted “capacity gaps” in KP’s counterterrorism department, revealing that CTD spends less than 4pc of its budget on operations, with zero allocation for procurement. 
The report, shared during a recent meeting of the National Security Committee — a copy of which is available with Dawn — notes that the KP environment remains “highly volatile” when compared with other provinces. 
Drawing comparison between Punjab and KP, the national agency points out in its finding that over the last one year, Punjab faced five terrorist incidents in which three people lost their lives and 30 others sustained injuries.  
In contrast, 704 such incidents took place in KP during the same period, claiming 305 lives and leaving 689 people injured, with 93 terrorists killed, mostly by security forces. 

Minister calls agency’s finding ‘eye opener’, asks CM to pay serious attention to situation

It noted that despite facing growing terrorism, the KP government’s focus on its counterterrorism capacity building was absent.  
“The main issue revolves around budgetary allocations for procurements [and] upgradation of equipment, training of human resource, allocations for operations as well as infrastructure,” it pointed out. 
The report said that the budget for KP’s CTD (Rs2.18 billion), including salaries, was less than half of Punjab’s (Rs4.7bn). It reveals that 96pc of this budget is spent in pay and allowances. Out of the total Rs2,180 million, less than 4pc (Rs8m) is dedicated for operations, compared to Rs276m for Punjab. 
According to the report, there was no allocations for procurements despite the fact that pay and allowances are the lowest among the provinces. The reward money in KP’s CTD was Rs70m compared to Rs475m in Punjab. 
The CTD Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with 2,135 staff posted against the authorised strength of 3,161 has the highest strength among all the provinces. The average strength of CTD in other districts is 66. But the qualification of human resource is “poor, untrained and very ill-equipped,” says the report about the KP’s CTD. 
Training and infrastructure 
It further pointed out that no raining institution had been established or even planned by the KP government. In Punjab, training is supervised by retired SSG officers, whereas KP lacks such training paraphernalia. No such plans are in the offing. 
About the infrastructure, the intelligence agency said that four regional headquarters, including one in Bannu, were under construction for many years. While work on many others has not even started due to bureaucratic hurdles. 
Newly merged districts of erstwhile Fata lack basic infrastructure where no dedicated manpower and officers have been posted.  
“CTD manpower was nominated from existing Levies / Khasadars… [but they] were not imparted any training,” it said.  
District offices are under construction for the last two years, barring Khyber and Mohmand districts where work has not started yet. 
Cyber capability 
According to the report, the Punjab CTD has a state-of-the-art cyber facility in sharp contrast with KP which does not have any such arrangement in place. The critically needed technical equipment are also absent.  
The KP CTD has only 448 vehicles, including 361 motorcycles, as compared to 1,466 in Punjab. 
While commenting on the report, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said, “The report of national institution about KP’s counterterrorism department is an eye opener and worrisome.”
In a statement, he expressed alarm over the rising tide of terrorism in KP and the “missing” role of the provincial government in the counterterrorism capacity building. 
He said the chief minister should pay “serious attention” to the situation and “spend more time in his province and less in Zaman Park” — the residence of PTI Chairman Imran Khan in Lahore.  
He claimed that the federal government had offered assistance on capacity building of CTD and police in KP, but regretted that a response was still awaited. 
He said the “criminal negligence” on part of Imran Khan and KP Chief Minister Mahmood Khan in tackling terrorism was tantamount to helping the terrorists.  
Holding Imran Khan responsible for ruining the CTD in KP, he advised the PTI chief to focus on fighting terrorism instead of attacking the federation and institutions.

3,20m flood-hit people dependent on humanitarian aid: Sherry,Says appeals by UN have received only 30pc of $816m pledged by international community.,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Monday said 20 million people affected by the recent catastrophic floods were currently dependent on humanitarian aid, while flash appeals by the United Nations have received only 30 per cent of the $816 million pledged by the international community.  
“When a country has people living on relief and multilateral assistance on the shores of vulnerability, with new lakes being created by climate events, it is not easy to plan for resilient recovery, because building back for complex climate polycrises implies transformational re-sets.  
“These floods caused ‘Loss and Damage’ worth $30 billion, so just the rehabilitation and disaster-reconstruction needs are at least $16.3bn. This amount does not include investments required to support Pakistan’s adaptation to climate change and overall resilience of the country to future climate shocks,” the minister said in a statement.  
The UN has warned that 8.4- 9.1 million people will be pushed below the poverty line, she added.  
Senator Rehman said winter will be harsh on the forgotten arc of climate misery here, adding that the numbers are too huge that around 33m impacted literally meant “we were reinventing the lives of populations covering the size of three medium-sized European countries at the same time”.  
“Today, after months of humanitarian operations, 14.6m is the number of people who still need emergency food assistance from December 2022 to March 2023. We should not forget that almost 3.9m people in Sindh and 1.6m in Balochistan are facing severe food insecurity, with 5.5m people no longer having access to safe and clean drinking water,” Ms Rehman said.  
The minister warned that children are at the frontline of the flood aftermath, with 9.6m in urgent need of humanitarian assistance out of the total 20m affected. “With the onset of winter and temperatures dropping to single digits, the survival of children in camps is at stake.”  
She urged all local philanthropists and international agencies to assist the provincial governments in sharing this unprecedented burden with Pakistan, and it is estimated that 1.6m children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, and 7m are in desperate need of nutrition services.  
She said that over half a million children are expected to go unvaccinated in areas devastated by floods, which will be disastrous for Pakistan’s efforts to eradicate polio. 
The future of these children is also in peril as more than 2m have been forced to stay out of school due to damages caused to more than 34,000 schools, with education for girls among the most impacted.  
Amin Ahmed adds: UNHCR, the UN agency for refugees, on Monday announced that one of the world’s leading beauty company had donated one million euros to provide emergency support for the flood-affected communities in Pakistan as well as help rebuild infrastructures such as schools, hospitals and shelters. 
The donation from L’Oreal Group will contribute to UNHCR’s response to about 8.5 million people in Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa grappling with the devastating effects of recent floods. The key activities include handing over of emergency relief items such as blankets, shelters, mosquito nets and solar-powered lanterns, UNHCR said in a press release.

4,All cases registered against Swati in Balochistan quashed,Awan concludes arguments for PTI senator’s bail...,"ISLAMABAD / QUETTA: While the Balochistan High Court (BHC) on Monday issued orders for quashing of three more cases registered against Azam Swati in various parts of the province, the counsel for the PTI senator concluded arguments before an FIA court in Islamabad, seeking post-arrest bail for his client.
Babar Awan argued before the FIA’s special court that the complainant, who had lodged the FIR against Mr Swati’s controversial tweets, was not an aggrieved person.
He said the case had been registered by the FIA and it is not on a par with the complaint filed under the defamation laws.
Mr Awan argued that the court, headed by Judge Azam Khan, can impose a maximum penalty of Rs1,000 on Senator Swati over his tweets, but he is being dragged from one province to another.
The court asked FIA’s special prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi to advance his arguments on Tuesday.

Awan concludes arguments for PTI senator’s bail

Earlier this month, the FIA arrested Mr Swati for defamation, statement conducing to public mischief, and a highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets that he launched after a fiery speech at a PTI rally in Rawalpindi in which he lashed out at senior military leadership.
He was taken to Balochistan before being transferred to Sindh.
In Quetta, a BHC bench headed by Justice Abdul Hameed Baloch ordered the police to quash three more cases, which were registered against Mr Swati in Hub and Chaman districts. 
The court issued the orders while hearing a constitutional petition filed by Usman Swati, the son of Mr Swati, in which he had pleaded that multiple cases could not be registered on the same charges. 
He urged the court to quash the cases registered in Winder, Hub and Chaman towns. 
After quashing of these three cases, no other case is left against the PTI leader in Balochistan, the court observed.  
It may be recalled that the BHC had last week ordered that no new case should be registered against Mr Swati on the same charges in the province.
Earlier on Dec 6, five similar cases reregistered in Quetta, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Qila Saifullah and Kuchlak towns had been quashed on the court’s orders. 
Mr Swati was booked under Section 20 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, which deals with offences against the dignity of a person.
Imran’s bail extended
Meanwhile, the anti-terrorism court of Islamabad extended the interim bail of PTI Chairman Imran Khan in a case lodged against him with the Sangjani Police Station for violating the order of Election Commission of Pakistan.
Babar Awan, who represented the former prime minister, through an application sought exemption for Mr Khan from personal appearance on medical grounds.
The court extended the interim bail till Jan 10 and adjourned the hearing till that date.
Besides, the court granted post-arrest bail to Punjab Assembly’s Deputy Speaker Wasiq Qayyum Abbasi. 
An FIR was registered at the Industrial Area Police Station against Mr Abbasi in connection with alleged violence during the PTI’s long march.

5,Pakistan enrols one million non-Muslim voters in four years,"Number jumped from 3.63m in 2018 to 4.43m this year, Nadra chief tells interfaith team.","ISLAMABAD: The number of voters belonging to religious minorities in the country has climbed to 4.43 million from 3.63 million in 2018. The number of voters from religious minorities was 2.77m in electoral rolls for the 2013 general election.
The latest figures of minority voters were disclosed by National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) Chairman Tariq Malik during a consultative session with an interfaith delegation, led by Senator Kamran Michael, which called on him here on Monday.
The Nadra chairman informed the delegation that the authority had so far registered 4.43m people belonging to minority communities including Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and people belonging to other religions.
Senator Gurdeep Singh, Senator Danesh Kumar, Senator Anwar Lal Dean, Senator Krishna Bai, MNA Amir Naveed Jeeva and MPA Shakeel Marcus Khokhar attended the consultative session.
The interfaith delegation briefed the Nadra chairman of problems being faced by their communities in getting the legal identity in the country.

Number jumped from 3.63m in 2018 to 4.43m this year, Nadra chief tells interfaith team

Mr Tariq Malik informed members of the delegation that rights of the people belonging to minority communities were as important as the rights of any other citizen of Pakistan.
He said that religious minorities in Pakistan contributed to the political and social stability, development and prosperity of the state and they were considered significant components in maintaining peace and stability in society.
“We are all equal citizens of this country and we all have equal rights. Article 20 of the Constitution of Pakistan gives freedom to all citizens to practice their religions and to run their own religious institutions,” Mr Malik said.
He said that Nadra, being the custodian of identity of citizens of the country, was fully aware of its responsibility and gave priority to registration of people belong to minorities. 
He said that Nadra was launching a special registration campaign titled “Identity Empowerment” to speed up the process of registration of minorities in the country.
The purpose of the consultative session and the focused campaign was to create awareness among members of minority communities to obtain identity as it enables them to exercise their social, economic and political rights.
While launching the week-long campaign of minority registration, Mr Malik said that after assuming the charge as the chairman of the authority a year ago he immediately dismantled barriers hampering registration of people from other religions and communities.
He said he had created the Inclusive Registration Department in this regard so that no individual could be left behind. With regard to registering unregistered people, the Nadra chairman announced that in order to facilitate minority groups issuance of identity cards for the first time would be free of cost.
He further announced that marriage could also be registered without producing the Nikah Nama if the spouse provided biometric attestation and divorce could also be registered with Nadra on the basis of an affidavit to facilitate members of minority communities.
He said that Nadra had started a helpline to facilitate people about Nadra policy and procedures and Nadra helpline would be integrated with the helpline of ministry of human rights. 
He also announced a special counter and preferential treatment at Nadra registration centres to people belonging to different religions.

6,Zong4G tests its digital nano-bank,"Mobile based app PayMax is likely to be launched in the first week of January, 2023, say sources.","ISLAMABAD: Zong4G has initiated the tests of its digital nano-bank by the name of “PayMax” to become the last of all the four mobile service providers launching its fintech.
The mobile based app — PayMax is likely to be launched in the first week of January, 2023, sources in the company said.
Currently, Zone4G is Pakistan’s third largest mobile service provider with around more than 45 million subscribers, and the company is banking on its customer base especially in rural parts to target for PayMax. But initial reports suggest PayMax will have limited options compared to the leading players in the market — Jazz cash and Easypaisa.
Initially, PayMax will cater for money transfer and bank account to any 1-Link connected bank, bill payment and some other services.
This will be the second fintech by Zong as it had launched “Timepey Service” in the country in collaboration with Askari Bank a decade ago though the mobile based banking solution was discontinued in 2016.
The current fintech by Zong is not backed by any bank. It is based on Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) regulations issued by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in 2019, under the Payment Systems and Electronic Fund Transfers Act, 2007.

7,Lasbela gas explosion claims eight lives,Death toll may rise as 12 injured in blast.,"KHUZDAR: A huge fire broke out when a gas cylinder at a shop exploded, leaving eight people dead and a dozen others injured in a town of Lasbela district on Monday, officials said.
The cylinder exploded while being refilled at a filling shop in the main Bela bazaar of Lasbela, the police said, adding the flames engulfed other gas cylinders du­­m­ped in the shop and spread to other shops, destroying at least four of them and around two do­­zen motorbikes parked in the vicinity.
“Twenty people received burn injuries, including the owner of the shop, in the cylinder explosion,” Lasbela deputy commissioner Murad Kasi told Dawn, adding that police and Levies officials immediately rushed to the spot to shift them to hospital.

Death toll may rise as 12 injured in blast

8,Ulema head to Afghanistan's Kandahar for talks on border clashes,Delegation will meet Kandahar Governor Haji Moha­mmad Wafaand and other senior leaders of Afghan Taliban.,"QUETTA: As part of efforts to find a solution and restore peace at Pak-Afghan border at Chaman, a delegation comprising religious scholars and tribal elders from Chaman left for Kandahar on Monday, with the mandate to hold negotiations with Afghan Taliban leadership over the border clashes issue.
“It is a 16-member delegation, headed by a prominent religious scholar Qari Aslam Alamyar, including tribal elders and prominent business leaders of Chaman,” an official of the local administration said.
The delegation will meet Kandahar Governor Haji Moha­mmad Wafaand and other senior leaders of Afghan Taliban to hold talks to ease tension on both sides of the border.
The talks are being held over a week after unprovoked shelling by the Afghan border forces on the civilian settlement in Pakistan left at least nine people dead and over 40 others wounded.
The decision to send the delegation of tribal elders and religious leaders was taken after the Saturday flag meeting was postponed. The Pakistani officials then said the flag meeting between security officials of both countries could not yield positive results, as the authorities across the border were faced with the challenge of grouping within Afghan leaders. In this situation, the Afghan Taliban could not ensure concrete steps to bring normality to border areas.
Sources said that after meeting with the governor of Kandahar and other Taliban leaders, the delegation could visit Kabul, if needed, for further negotiations with the high-ups of the Afghan government including Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob, the son of late Mullah Omar. 
Meanwhile, the Pakistan and Afghan forces were alert at their positions with heavy weapons to meet any untoward situation. A team of senior doctors and paramedical staff with all required medicines earlier arrived at Chaman to provide medical treatment to the victims of unprovoked shelling by the Afghan forces.
