• Zardari, Shehbaz, Shujaat nexus continues efforts to salvage Punjab Assembly, awaits Elahi’s response on cousin’s offer to join PDM
LAHORE: After days of hectic politicking, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) alliance on Monday sprang its own trap to limit the options available to Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi ahead of the Imran Khan-announced dissolution of the provincial assembly, which is supposed to happen this Friday.
In a double-edged move, Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman has asked the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence from the Punjab Assembly on Wednesday (tomorrow), while PML-N and PPP lawmakers have submitted a separate no-trust resolution against him in a bid to bar him from dissolving the assembly.
The move followed a meeting of party leaders from the PDM coalition, chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Under the law, the chief minister cannot dissolve the assembly if a no-confidence motion has been moved against him, while the governor’s requirement for the CM to seek a vote of confidence from the house means he has to ensure that he manages to secure 186 votes on Wednesday.
The PTI has 177 while the PML-Q has 10 members in the Punjab Assembly. On the other hand, the opposition boasts a combined 176 members from the PML-N, PPP and Rah-i-Haq parties.
Although the PML-N had claimed that it would hold elections if the PTI dissolved both assemblies, fresh elections have never been in its scheme of things, and even on Monday, senior alliance leaders met to discuss options to keep the provincial legislature intact.
After their meeting over the weekend, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari and Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain’s faction of the PML-Q continued their contacts on Monday.
Governor’s missive
According to a notification issued late on Monday night, the governor has summoned session of the Punjab Assembly on Wednesday at 4pm, and has required the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence in terms of Article 130(7) of the Constitution.
 






In his order, the governor said CM Elahi has lost the confidence of his party president Chaudhry Shujaat and his own party MPAs. “It is widely known that over the last few weeks, serious differences of opinion have erupted between the two coalition parties – PTI and PML-Q – regarding political strategies, dissolution of assembly, development schemes and transfers of public officials.”
The order also cited differences between the coalition partners over inclusion of Khayal Ahmad of PTI in the provincial cabinet and resignation of provincial minister Sardar Hasnain Bahadur Dreshak.
The governor also cited Chaudhry Parvez Elahi’s Dec 4 statement that he was not going to dissolve the PA until March 2023 – “a position which is completely at odds with the PTI’s public position on the issue and it led to resignation of two PTI MPAs in protest.”
No-trust
Many observers were also surprised by the ease with which PML-N and PPP lawmakers submitted a no-trust motion in the PA against CM Elahi, which was in sharp contrast to the official wrangling that characterised no-trust votes moved earlier this year against the deputy speaker and Mr Elahi.
This has fueled speculation that the Elahi faction may be trying to reach a settlement with the PDM coalition.
Talking to reporters after submitting the no-confidence motion, PM’s Special Assistant on Interior Attaullah Tarar said that no-trust resolutions had also been submitted against the Punjab Assembly speaker and deputy speaker.
PPP lawmaker Hasan Murtaza said they would know “in a day or two” whether Parvez Elahi remains CM or is replaced by someone else.
“Mr Zardari knows the art of making the impossible possible. Soon the people will hear good news,” he said.
PM meets Shujaat-allied ministers
PM Shehbaz met with cabinet members from Chaudhry Shujaat’s faction, and was told that he would receive an update on the outcome of their talks with Parvez Elahi by Wednesday (tomorrow).
“PM Shehbaz discussed the prospects of CM Elahi to join hands with the PDM with PML-Q ministers Salik Hussain and Tariq Bashir Cheema. They told the premier that the outcome of Chaudhry Shujaat’s talks with Mr Elahi would come to the fore by Wednesday,” a PML-N insider told Dawn.
The ‘Q’ ministers reportedly said that all was not well between the PTI and Parvez Elahi and that the CM’s interview, which was critical of Imran Khan for his ‘hard stance’ on the former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, had created several misgivings.
“Chaudhry Shujaat has been in contact with Mr Elahi and it will be known soon whether the latter is interested in cutting a deal with the PDM,” the insider quoted the ministers as having said.
“Although it is not easy to bridge the gulf between the Sharifs and Mr Elahi, political compulsions can make both parties flexible,” he said.
The meeting was also attended by PML-N ministers Ahsan Iqbal and Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, the premier’s special assistants Attauallh Tarar and Malik Ahmad Khan, MPAs Azma Bokhari and Rana Mashhood and former minister Zahid Hamid.
Zardari ‘green lights’ no trust
Mr Zardari, meanwhile, chaired a meeting of PPP’s parliamentary party in the provincial assembly on Monday and took them on board over his discussions with PM Shehbaz and Chaudhry Shujaat.
The PPP huddle reviewed the political scenario in Punjab and the options available to strengthen the democratic system in the country.
Earlier, Salik Hussain, the federal minister and a son of Chaudhry Shujaat, called on Mr Zardari at Bilawal House in Bahria Town and conveyed to him a message from his father. The one-on-one meeting lasted for about 45 minutes.
Sources privy to the meeting said that it was here that the g0-ahead was given for filing a no-trust motion against CM Elahi in the provincial assembly.

• KP official warns of strict action if TTP men fail to lay down arms
• Imran blames PDM for rise in terrorism; ANP accuses PTI of weakening CTD
PESHAWAR/ LAKKI MARWAT: The standoff between the security forces and banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants continued on Monday as the Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment (CTD) centre in Bannu remained under the militants’ control.
Late Sunday, the militants incarcerated in the CTD centre took control of the building after they snatched weapons from their investigators and took a number of law enforcers hostages. They had also fired upon the security personnel, reportedly injuring a CTD man and a soldier. The militants had demanded a safe passage to Afghanistan.
Despite the passage of 24 hours, there has been no breakthrough in talks with the militants for the release of the hostages. An official source said that the standoff continued and there was “no breakthrough in negotiations” with the militants who had taken over the compound. “The top priority is to free the hostages from the captivity of militants,” the source added.
In order to neutralise the situation, sources said, law enforcement agencies have decided to engage a cleric, Maulana Ahmadullah, from the Domail area of the city.
The cleric will be asked to reason with the TTP operatives who had taken CTD officials and other inmates as captives.
Meanwhile, the situation remained tense in the district bordering North Waziristan. The cantonment area where the CTD compound is located remained sealed, as police and security forces beefed up security, asking the residents to remain indoors.
The compound had also been cordoned off. “The roads leading to the cantonment area were also closed and policemen were deployed in the area,” a resident said. Another resident said that the situation was tense and fear persisted in the area. “The standoff and reports [videos of the compound] circulating on social media has aggravated our concerns,” he said.
The official source said that police had increased patrolling the area besides tightening checking of individuals and motorists on pickets. Keeping in view the volatile law and order situation, security forces also imposed a curfew on roads leading to North Waziristan and Bannu city. Meanwhile, in view of the precarious situation in the city, the deputy commissioner said all government and private educational institutions in Bannu will remain closed on Tuesday (Dec 20).
TTP statement
The attack on the compound has been claimed by the TTP as the banned outfit confirmed in a statement that its members had taken several CTD and security personnel hostages. In a statement, the group’s spokesperson said that in an earlier video statement, the hostage takers had demanded a safe exit but they mistakenly mentioned Afghanistan since they were not aware of ground realities. He said that the group talked to government authorities overnight and asked them to shift the prisoners to North Waziristan or South Waziristan but there was no positive response from their side.
The militants inside the seized CTD centre also released several videos earlier in the day, asking the people of Bannu, especially the ulema, to come forward and resolve the standoff between the militants and the law enforcers through dialogue.
In a video clip, a detainee declared himself ‘innocent’ and said along with the Taliban militants and officials taken hostage by the militants, several innocents were also present inside the compound.
In the video, he said that the elders and the ulema of Bannu should intervene to avoid bloodshed and settle the standstill in a peaceful manner. “The people and army are ours and the Taliban wanted to go outside [the compound] to kill people, but we stopped them,” he added. In another video clip, several armed militants could be seen roaming and taking positions inside the compound. A militant, who was not visible in the video clip, said that his “Mujahideen companions were ready”. In the video, he was heard asking them not to damage vehicles or oppress anyone in the CTD centre.
In a video released from CTD Center in Bannu, one of the individuals in the video has been identified as Commander Zarrar, who had been under custody. Zarrar had merged his group with TTP and it was still unclear what he was doing in the CTD centre even though he was in custody since January 2022.
‘Warning to militants’
In Peshawar, KP CM’s aide Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said the government will not fulfil any demand put forth by the militants and asked them to lay down arms, warning them of stern action in case of non-compliance.
“There was no attack on the CTD Center from outside. Some under-custody militants snatched weapons [from investigators] and took a few police personnel hostages,” he said, claiming that the situation in Bannu was under control.
The statement further said that the militants wanted to gain the sympathy of general public by sharing videos on social media. “It is better if these people laid down arms, otherwise strict action will be taken against them,” the statement quoted the adviser as saying.
ANP, PTI statements
PTI Chairman Imran Khan, whose party is in power in KP, accused the federal government of failing to rein in terrorism. “Apart from running our economy to the ground, this imported government has failed to deal with the 50% increase in terrorism in Pak with incidents from Chaman to Swat to Lakki Marwat to Bannu.”
In a tweet, the former prime minister said, “They have also failed to deal with attacks from the international Pak-Afghan border by security forces of a ‘friendly’ Afghan government.”
“While our soldiers, police & local people are giving daily sacrifices with their lives, the worst part is that this increasing terrorist threat & attacks from across our Western border are finding no space in the discourse of this government of a cabal of crooks,” he added.
 






Meanwhile, Awami National Party (ANP) KP President Aimal Wali Khan accused the PTI-led government of deliberately attempting to weaken the police and CTD, terming it the reason why effective action could not be taken against militants.
Addressing a press conference, the ANP leader said that due to the effectiveness of CTD in Punjab, the province was witnessing fewer incidents of terrorism as compared to KP. “On one hand, the CTD was kept in a weak condition while on the other talks were started with the TTP at the behest of the PTI government and terrorists were brought to KP from Afghanistan,” he claimed. He alleged that the move of “repatriating terrorists: was aimed at protecting the PTI leadership while ousting its political rivals from the political arena through violence.

2,"US offers help with TTP threat, India rivalry","""We urge those responsible to cease all acts of violence, release hostages and end the seizure"" of CTD centre in Bannu, says Ned Price.","WASHINGTON: Indicating it is closely following reports that militants have seized control of a counterterrorism centre in Bannu, the United States on Monday offered unconditional support to Pakistan in its battle against the TTP and similar groups, saying that defeating terrorism was a shared goal of both countries.
At the same time, it also offered to assist India and Pakistan in resolving their differences, reminding them that they were key global partners and that America would like to continue ‘valuable partnerships’ with both.
US State Department Spokesperson Ned Price made these remarks at a news briefing, hours after Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari reached Washington for talks with US officials.
“We offer our deepest sympathies to those injured. We urge those responsible to cease all acts of violence, release the hostages and end the seizure of the counterterrorism centre,” he said.
“The government of Pakistan is a partner when it comes to these shared concerns, including the challenge of terrorist groups inside Afghanistan… terrorist groups along the Afghan-Pakistan border… we stand ready to assist, whether with this unfolding situation or other situations,” he said while responding to a question about Monday’s takeover of a CTD centre in Bannu.
Responding to another question about last week’s war of words between the Indian and Pakistani foreign ministers inside the United Nations, Mr. Price said: “We have a global strategic partnership with India. I have just spoken to the depth of our partnership with Pakistan. The two relationships stand on their own. It’s not a zero-sum relationship.”
The US, he said, sees the importance of maintaining these valuable partnerships with our Indian and our Pakistani friends, adding that they had a relationship in which “we can be friends with both”.
“As far as these disagreements are concerned… we have partnerships with both countries and that makes us not want to see wars of words between India and Pakistan. We would like to see constructive dialogue between India and Pakistan.”

3,"Toshakhana record is classified, govt tells high court",LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday directed the federal government to submit complete details of the...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Monday directed the federal government to submit complete details of the Toshakhana gifts received by political rulers and bureaucrats from foreign dignitaries since the creation of Pakistan, after a legal officer representing the Centre claimed the record was ‘classified’.
While objecting to the maintainability of a petition against non-provision of the details by the government, the federal law officer argued before the court that the record of Toshakhana articles was classified in nature and could not be made public.
The ministries of parliamentary affairs and interior, and Pakistan Infor­mation Commission have been arrayed as respondents in the petition.
However, Justice Asim Hafeez, who was hearing the petition filed by Advocate Muneer Ahmad, observed that the details were classified only when a buyer or retainer of Toshakhana items was supposed to declare his purchases in the annual tax returns.
The court then directed the law officer to present the details and let the court decide whether the matter was classified or not.
The judge adjourned the hearing till Jan 16, 2023.
Earlier, petitioner’s counsel Azhar Siddique argued that the people of Pakistan had a right to know every public act, everything that was done in a public way, by public functionaries and their chosen representatives.
He said the right to information was an integral part of a progressive democratic state and the same had been elaborated by the superior courts saying the right to information in all matters of public importance was indisputably a fundamental right guaranteed under Article(s) 19 and 19-A of the Constitution.
He said the public at large was entitled to know details of every public transaction and acquire information in all matters of public importance.
He stated that the right to information stemmed from the requirement that members of a democratic society should be adequately informed that they might intelligently influence the decision which may affect them.
The counsel asked the court to allow the petition and order the respondents to make public the details of assets gifted to rulers as well as bureaucrats and also provide the names, details, information, documentation and materials in respect of the persons/officials who have obtained the assets by making the payment.

4,"Ignoring ally, Imran continues castigating ex-army chief Bajwa",Says PML-Q has its own policy towards retired Gen Bajwa; Fawad confirms PTI committee to discuss seat adjustment with PML-Q.,"• Says PML-Q has its own policy towards retired Gen Bajwa
• Fawad confirms PTI committee to discuss seat adjustment with PML-Q
LAHORE: PTI Chairman Imran Khan on Monday continued castigating former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa for toppling his government in league with the ‘foreign hands’ and pushing the country into political and economic crises.
Mr Khan went on to lash out at the former army chief only a day after his coalition partner and Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi strongly criticised the former prime minister for speaking against Gen Bajwa whom he considers their ‘benefactor’.
The PML-Q leader warned Mr Khan as well as all other PTI leaders that he would not tolerate anything spoken against Gen Bajwa and would respond in even harsher tone, besides allowing every party member to speak against the former army chief’s critics.
However, Imran Khan said the PTI and PML-Q were separate political entities and his ally had its own policy towards Gen Bajwa. Speaking to foreign media persons, he confirmed Mr Elahi’s statement that a signed advice to the Punjab governor to dissolve the provincial assembly was lying with him and it would be forwarded to the governor on Friday.
However, the latest developments with regard to the Punjab governor calling the chief minister to take a fresh vote of confidence and the PML-N filing a no-confidence motion against CM Elahi suggest that it’s unlikely the dissolution advice would be sent to the governor on Friday.
The PTI chief said he would continue holding Gen Bajwa responsible for removing his government, adding that he was currently not sure about the US role and that was why he wanted an inquiry into the cipher conspiracy.
He alleged that NAB was under the control of the former army chief and gave NRO to all the corrupt despite his strong resistance. “Gen Bajwa continued betraying me and imposed corrupt and plunderers to rule the 220 million population.”
When pointed out that the PDM was trying to persuade CM Elahi to join hands with the opposition and become its candidate to continue as the chief minister, Mr Khan said the PML-Q was an independent party and was free to hold consultations with anyone.
Seat adjustment
According to sources, the PTI chief said Mr Elahi was showing aggressive attitude to get a larger share of seats being allied party in the next general elections.
However, fearing Mr Elahi’s alliance with the PDM, sources told Dawn that the PTI had come to terms and wanted to begin serious talks on seat adjustment. They said the PML-Q had initially demanded 25 to 30 seats in the newly carved Gujrat division, parts of south Punjab and even Sialkot.
Party’s senior leader Fawad Chaudhry said the PTI had tasked a three-member committee, led by vice chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi, with discussing seat adjustment with the PML-Q. Mr Elahi, it may be mentioned, had made it clear to the PTI chairman that he would only talk to a committee comprising party’s secretary general Asad Umar, former defence minister Pervaiz Khattak and Punjab Assembly Speaker Sabtain Khan.
Though Mr Elahi had given a signed assembly dissolution advice to the PTI chief, the former had clearly stated that the military establishment did not want the assemblies to be dissolved in the current tough economic crisis. The sources said Mr Elahi’s statement clearly belied the establishment’s stance that they had become apolitical and neutral.
They said that in case the Punjab Assembly is dissolved, the appointment of an interim set-up would go in the hands of CM Elahi and opposition leader Hamza Shehbaz, keeping the PTI out of the process.
“In case both Elahi and Hamza do not reach a consensus, the ball will land in the court of the Election Commission of Pakistan, which as per PTI claims, is allegedly siding with the PDM government, and keep the Punjab’s ruling coalition out of the game,” a source close to the developments told Dawn.
Parvez Elahi had also stated in so many words that the establishment was also thinking that the incumbent government could impose an “economic emergency” for a year that could delay elections beyond 2023, the source added.
The PTI chairman is also looking for a green signal from the establishment as he told media persons in another meeting that he had given one-week delayed time for the dissolution of assemblies so that the powers that be should brood and work out an implementable plan.
Responding to a question about backdoor channel talks between President Arif Alvi and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar, the PTI chief said he was hoping against hope that these talks would conclude on finalising an early date for general elections. He said he knew the PDM government did not want to hold general elections early.
With regard to retired Gen Bajwa, Mr Khan said he and Mr Elahi had different experiences with the former army chief and denied that anything was decided between him and the Punjab CM to discuss the ex-army chief in his Saturday’s speech.
“Parvez Elahi remained with me for almost an hour after the speech but did not even mention his displeasure,” Mr Khan was quoted as saying. The PTI chief also said Mr Elahi needed to stay in alliance with him, if the latter wanted to save his politics.
PDM government scolded
In a series of tweets, the PTI chief scolded the PDM government for failing to control terrorism, pushing the economy to fall flat and still not reconciling to hold early elections and eventually bring political and economic stability in the country.
In his tweets, Mr Khan stated that this “imported government had failed to deal with the 50 per cent increase in terrorism in Pakistan with incidents from Chaman to Swat to Lakki Marwat to Bannu besides tearing apart country’s economy”.
He said the PDM government also failed to deal with attacks from the international border by security forces of a ‘friendly’ Afghan government. “While our soldiers, police and local people are giving daily sacrifices with their lives, the worst part is that this increasing terrorist threat and attacks from across our Western border are finding no space in the discourse of this government of a cabal of crooks.”
Mr Khan stated that all they were interested in was their NRO2 [deal] and its preservation. “Therefore despite economy tanking, they are petrified of holding elections which is the only way to stabilise economy through political stabilisation,” he commented.
 






Usman Buzdar
As Chief Minister Parvez Elahi chided his predecessor Usman Buzdar for victimising him and neglecting Gujrat district in development works, the latter said he could also say many a thing, but this was not the occasion. “My message is love and respect to my colleagues,” Mr Buzdar added.
Stating that he remained the chief minister for more than three years and did a lot of development works, ensured good governance and never indulged in victimisation of anybody, Mr Buzdar said any criticism against him was actually directed to the PTI’s narrative. He said Gujrat district was given due development funds as part of the districts development package.
