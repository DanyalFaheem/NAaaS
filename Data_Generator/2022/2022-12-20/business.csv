• Silence of friendly countries, IMF impasse driving market sentiment down
Despite proclamations of ‘all is well’ from the country’s financial managers, anyone who has recently tried to buy foreign currency will tell you that things are dire.
Dollars have disappeared from the open market, while a crisis in the inter-bank market has led to the stoppage of foreign payments. The country is unable to clear the dues owed to airlines or make payments for imported goods waiting at ports. Opening letters of credit (LCs) has become a challenge and transactions with the country’s foreign missions are also proving problematic.
The ascendant dollar is not a Pakistan-specific problem; according to Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer, the war in Ukraine has contributed to the strengthening of the US dollar. 
“The economies of the European Union were badly affected by the gas and oil supply cut from Russia, but the US remained strong being self-sufficient. As a result, the dollar became stronger against the euro and the pound as trust in the greenback increased,” he said.
“When Russia asked oil buyers to pay in rubles, this caused demand for the dollar shoot up as countries hoping to buy cheap Russian oil have started buying dollars to convert to rubles,” Mr Ahmad said.
As this was happening, central banks of developed and developing economies around the world were increasing interest rates to curb inflation, but the higher interest rates coupled with astronomical prices caused even more problems, as evidenced by the cost of living crisis in the UK.
Then came the exchange rate fluctuations as other currencies reeled from the rise of the dollar. 
When Dawn contacted currency dealers on the open market, most claimed that all foreign currencies were available with them, except the US dollar.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) Chairman Malik Bostan told Dawn that only dollars were are not available, while other currencies like the euro, British pound, dirham or Saudi riyal were still available. 
However, a market survey revealed that even other currencies are not available at the quoted market rates, and nearly everyone is charging a premium on all major foreign currencies. In addition, only few large currency exchangers were found still selling other currencies like euros, pounds, while most dealers said they had none.
Market observers argue that with the advent of holiday season, demand has been driven up by the rush of travellers who are heading to destinations abroad, such as the US, Europe and Middle East. Despite their prices being on the higher side, market stakeholders claim that people buying currency to fulfil their travel needs is one of the factors responsible for the shortage of foreign currencies. 
Here, the question that arises is why is the dollar so hard to come by? The most common answer points to the greenback’s strength; despite a year of global downturn, the US dollar has been on the rise. 
In the calendar year 2022, the euro fell lower than the dollar, plunging to $0.98 in the first week of November. At the beginning of the year, the euro was priced at $1.14, but on Dec 17, it was valued at $1.06.
Similarly, the pound rate also underwent fluctuations that were exacerbated by a cost of living crisis in the UK. Although it began the year at $1.351, it was down to $1.21 by Dec 17, having touched the low of $1.11 on Nov 3. 
But whether it is the currency’s own strength or the fact that it is being smuggled to neighbouring countries, the shortage of dollars has created multiple crises. 
Many industries that rely on imported raw or semi-raw materials are finding it extremely difficult to continue operations. A number of businessmen are trying to sell out their business to leave the country as trust in government policies has also nose-dived. 
State Minister Aisha Ghaus Pasha’s recent admission that all is not well on the economic front has also done little to address their concerns. 
Commentators say those who still have capital have stopped investing in the local economy and are buying dollars and other supposedly reliable currencies. There is also little trust on the inter-bank exchange rate, which is being controlled by the government and the State Bank but is hardly followed. 
The State Bank’s claim that default on external payments will be avoided also makes no difference to the business community, whose problems will not go away until the central bank’s forex shortage is addressed.
State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmed appears confident that the country will not default thanks to hopes of inflows worth $18 to 20 billion in this financial year. But the fact remains that Pakistan started FY23 with an estimated external financing need of $33bn — $23bn is debt and a current account deficit of $10bn.
The government now hopes to convince China for a rollover of about $13bn, and is also looking forward to getting back around $1.2bn that was provided to two commercial banks by State Bank. 
Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark, told Dawn: “What the market heard last week was complete silence from friendly countries and their promised pot of gold. Instead, even the $1.2bn from Chinese commercial banks that was supposed to come back did not materialize,”.
A half-hearted statement from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), probably aimed only to placate markets, said there was progress on talks. It seems likely that Pakistan will celebrate the New Year with little to actually celebrate about,” he said.

1,Pesco ordered to reverse increase in Right of Way charges,CCP issues order in favour of Nayatel and CyberNet against Pesco for abusing its dominant position.,"ISLAMABAD: The Com­petition Commission of Pak­istan (CCP) has issued an order in favour of Nayatel and CyberNet against Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) for abusing its dominant position.
Pesco was dominant in the market for “Right of Way (ROW) through electric poles availed by different types of cable service providers in the geographic boundary of Peshawar,” as it solely owned/managed the poles and there were no other substitutes.
Complaints were lodged by Nayatel Pvt Ltd and Cy­­ber Internet Services (Pvt) Ltd that the ROW charges were raised from Rs10 per pole to Rs100, for the internet service providers while the basic TV cable operators were charged Rs10 per pole. 
The complainants added that it was done without any legitimate justifications.
The CCP annulled Pesco’s pole renting policy after the initiation of the show-cause proceedings. 
However, as the same inter alia related to an essential public utility/ROW and there were no other means available for the complainants to provide cable, internet, and telephony services to end consumers, thus, negatively impacting consumers and other stakeholders. 
The CCP order stated that, Pesco was found to have ab­­used its dominant position. It also stated that Pesco’s conduct was also discriminatory as admittedly decommissioning noti­ces related to the removal of cables were only sent to the complainants and not others like the basic tv cables. 
The CCP has directed Pesco to restore access and provide the ROW to Nayatel and Cybernet, on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. 
The CCP obser­ved that fee has to be equal for all cable installations. 
If Pesco did not abide by the order it will have to pay a fixed penalty of Rs75 million and an additional penalty of Rs0.5m for every day after the first of such violations or the subject abuse had occurred.

2,FBR attempts to convince IMF it can achieve target without new taxes,Source says expanding direct tax collection will offset import stage shortfalls.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is trying to narrow gaps with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over revenue collection projection for the next seven months (December-June) in a bid to end the uncertainty that has stemmed from the delay in the 9th review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, Dawn learnt from official sources on Monday.
The fund officials estimate a shortfall of Rs422 billion in FY23, which the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has rejected. The board has, however, put forward its estimates before the IMF, stating that despite falling imports, the projected budgetary target can be achieved.
And FBR estimates show no need for fresh taxation measures to fill the proposed gap. However, IMF insisted on additional revenue measures to keep the revenue collection on track to reach the projected tax target of Rs7.47 trillion by the end of June 30, 2023, a 21.5 per cent growth over the last year’s collection. 
The FBR collected Rs2.688tr in July-November, exceeding the target set for the period by just Rs8bn.

Says expanding direct tax collection will offset import stage shortfalls

The gap in reporting mechanism between Pakistan and IMF did not confine only to FBR revenue collection but also include differences over the collection of petroleum development levy (PDL). The IMF estimates a shortfall of Rs300bn under the PDL in the current fiscal year. Pakistan’s finance ministry estimate this shortfall at Rs50bn, which was rejected by the IMF.
Consumption of petroleum products also declined 22pc in 5MFY23, which means lower general sales tax collection from the petroleum sector, one of the major revenue spinners.
Well-placed official sources told Dawn that FBR has already shared details of revenue collection in December and the second half of the current fiscal year. “We have informed the fund officials that the FBR target will be achieved without any additional revenue measures,” the source said, adding one of the main revenue sources is the impressive income tax collection.
The direct tax collection rose 53pc in 5MFY23, the source said, adding this trend will alone be sufficient to offset the impact of shortfall in revenue collection at the import stage.
Contrary to this, the IMF has already conveyed to Islamabad details about the shortfall in revenue collection in the second half of 2022-23. “We have not received any reply from the IMF on our estimations regarding revenue collection in the second half”, the source said.
Last week FBR Chairman Asim Ahmad visited Karachi, the hub of economic activities, and directed top tax officials to gear up their efforts to achieve maximum revenue collection and also clear backlog pending litigation. Mr Asim has given them specific targets in this regard as well.
On Tuesday, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar is also visiting FBR to get a briefing on the revenue collection performance. Mr Dar is also very desperate for the early conclusion of the 9th review, which should have been completed by the end of October.
The source said that the Ministry of Finance was also sharing PDL collection details with the IMF after questions were raised over its reporting mechanism and shortfalls.
“The issue will only be resolved once both sides minimise their gaps over the reporting mechanism”, the source said. The delay in the IMF review is linked to a pragmatic approach over revenue collection targets as well as PDL collection in the next half of FY23.
Pakistan entered a $6bn IMF programme in 2019, which was increased to $7bn earlier this year. The programme’s 9th review is currently pending with remote talks being held between IMF officials and the government for the release of the $1.18bn tranche.

3,Fuel cost for power generation drops by 34pc,"Share of imported gas in national power mix was 12.1pc in November, down 45.1pc from a month ago.","KARACHI: The cost of fuel for electricity generation in November went down by more than one-third to Rs5.99 per unit from a month ago, according to data recently released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority.
A 27.1pc reduction in the cost of coal-based electricity contributed to the overall drop of 33.6 per cent in the average fuel cost in November, according to Tahir Abbas, head of research at Arif Habib Ltd.
The per-unit cost of coal-generated power dropped from Rs17.61 in October to Rs12.84 in November, thanks to the addition of power plants that operate on Thar coal. Local coal isn’t benchmarked to the international prices and is, therefore, significantly cheaper than its global counterpart.
Similarly, the average cost of re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) also dropped 16.2pc on a monthly basis, which helped bring down the overall cost of fuel for electricity generation in November.
Long-term RLNG contracts under which Pakistan imports gas from Qatar are benchmarked to Brent, one of the indices reflective of oil prices in the international market. A drop in Brent has indirectly led to a reduction in Pakistan’s import bill for natural gas.
The share of imported gas in the national power mix was 12.1pc in November, down 45.1pc from a month ago.
Almost three in every 10 units of electricity in November were generated by hydel resources, which have effectively zero cost. However, the number of hydel-sourced electricity units produced last month was 21pc lower than a month ago because of the reduced flow of water in rivers.
Nuclear power also helped curtail the overall generation cost in November. Its per-unit rate stayed flat month-on-month at Re1.07. Its share in the power mix increased to 27.9pc from 20.6pc a year ago.
Even though the cost of furnace oil-based power declined 28.2pc month-on-month to Rs24.18 per unit, the fuel was still the most expensive among all sources. No wonder its share in the power mix was nominal last month. 
The unviability of furnace oil for power generation is reflected in the fact that local refineries are increasingly faced with “ullage” constraints. Storage tanks of local refineries are full of furnace oil as relevant power plants lie idle. The cyclical issue has caused temporary shutdowns in at least one of the five refineries.

4,OGDCL finds gas in Sanghar,KARACHI: Oil and Gas Deve­lopment Company Ltd (OGDCL) informed investors on Monday that it had discovered oil and...,"KARACHI: Oil and Gas Deve­lopment Company Ltd (OGDCL) informed investors on Monday that it had discovered oil and gas in an exploratory well named Chak-5 Dim South-3 in Sindh’s Sanghar district, reported Dawn.com.
In a regulatory filing, the company said drilling operations at the exploratory well had begun on June 26 using the OGDCL’s in-house expertise. The well was drilled down to a depth of 3,400 metres, it added.
“Based on the results of wireline logs interpretation, Drill Stem Test-1 in the massive sand has tested 2,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) and 1.30 million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) gas through choke size 32/64 inches at wellhead flowing pressure of 994 pounds per square inch (Psi),” it stated in the filing.
The OGDCL has 100 per cent stake in the well as operator, according to the filing.
The company said the discovery had opened a “new avenue and will positively contribute to mitigating energy demand and supply gaps from indigenous resources and will add to the hydrocarbon reserves base of OGDCL and the country”.
Earlier this year, the company had discovered oil and gas at an exploratory well named Nim East-1 in Tando Allah Yar district of Sindh.

5,Indus Motors shuts plant,"KARACHI: Indus Motor Company (IMC), the assembler of Toyota vehicles, will keep its production plant shut from Dec...","KARACHI: Indus Motor Company (IMC), the assembler of Toyota vehicles, will keep its production plant shut from Dec 20-30 due to a shortage of parts.
On May 20 the State Bank of Pakistan introduced a mechanism for obtaining prior approval for the import of completely knocked (CKD) kits and components of passenger cars (HS CODE 8703 category) for the auto sector. The delay in aforesaid approvals for IMC and its vendors has created hurdles in the import and clearance of consignments for raw materials and components, resulting in insufficient inventory levels. This situation has created an adverse impact on the supply chain and production activities, making the company unable to continue its production activities, the company said in a stock filing on Monday.
This is the third plant shutdown by the IMC since July 1. The company had kept its production operation suspended from Aug 1-13 and from Sept 1-16.
When IMC chief executive Ali Asghar Jamali was contacted regarding any layoff of workers (daily-wage, contractual and permanent employees) because of continuous plant closures, he said “we do not lay off our assets.”
In a corporate briefing to brokerage house analysts in November, IMC management said that the company was operating at 40-50pc capacity and the auto financing was down to 10pc from 35pc of total sales due to rising interest rates and a reduction in financing tenure.

KARACHI: Stocks tumbled on Monday on the rising confrontation between the coalition government and the main opposition party.
Topline Securities Ltd said the benchmark index moved up initially and made an intraday high of 92 points. However, sentiments couldn’t survive profit-taking by investors as the index slipped to its intraday low of 487 points.
Investors remained jittery as former prime minister Imran Khan announced that legislators belonging to his party would soon resign from two provincial assemblies — a move that’ll lead to more uncertain market conditions going forward. A deteriorating security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa didn’t help the mood of investors either.
As a result, the KSE-100 index settled at 40,970.82 points, down 330.66 points or 0.8 per cent from the preceding session.
The overall trading volume increased 2.1pc to 142.6 million shares. The traded value went down 8.3pc to $17m on a day-on-day basis.
Stocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Bank Alfalah Ltd (29m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (12.4m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (9.4m shares), K-Electric Ltd (5m shares) and Dewan Farooque Motors Ltd (4.4m shares).
Sectors that contributed negatively to the index performance were power generation and distribution (53.5 points), fertiliser (51.5 points), technology and communication (51.5 points), exploration and production (47.1 points) and automobile assembling (33.7 points).
Companies registering the biggest increase in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs98), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs55), Sanofi-Aventis Pakistan Ltd (Rs36), Mehmood Textile Mills Ltd (Rs27.95) and Gatron Industries Ltd (Rs25.26).
Companies that recorded the biggest declines in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs591), Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs140.72), Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs99), Bhanero Textile Mills Ltd (Rs84.30) and Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs50.61).
Foreign investors were net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $2.46m.
