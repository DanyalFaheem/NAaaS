KYIV: Moscow launched a  “kamikaze” drone attack on Monday, hitting key infrastructure in and around Kyiv, hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in Belarus, fuelling fears he will pressure his ally to join a new offensive on Ukraine.
The Ukrainian Air Force said its air defences shot down 30 drones, in the third Russian air attack on the Ukrainian capital in six days and the latest in a series of assaults since October that have targeted the Ukrainian power grid, causing sweeping blackouts amid sub-freezing temperatures.
Officials said at least three people were wounded and nine buildings damaged in the Kyiv region. The Ukrainian atomic energy agency accused Russia of sending one of the drones over part of the South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant, in the Mykolaiv region.
“This is an absolutely unacceptable violation of nuclear and radiation safety,” Energoatom wrote on Telegram. Invading Russian forces currently occupy the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, Europe’s largest, near the front line in southeastern Ukraine.
“Kamikaze” drones used in the attacks, are cheaply produced, disposable unmanned aircraft that fly towards their target before plummeting at velocity and detonating on impact. Under the darkness of night, a fire raged at an energy facility in the often targeted central Shevchenkivskyi district, a witness said. 
Putin in Belarus
Putin’s trip, for talks with Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko, is his first to Minsk since 2019 — before the pandemic and a wave of Belarusian protests in 2020 that Lukashenko crushed with strong support from the Kremlin.
“During (these talks) questions will be worked out for further aggression against Ukraine and the broader involvement of the Belarusian armed forces in the operation against Ukraine, in particular, in our opinion, also on the ground,” Ukrainian joint forces commander Serhiy Nayev said before Putin’s arrival.
Lukashenko has said repeatedly he has no intention of sending his country’s troops into Ukraine.
“The battlefield in Bakhmut is critical,” he said.  “We control the town even though the occupiers are doing everything so that no undamaged wall will remain standing.”  Zelenskiy on Monday called on Western leaders meeting in Latvia, including British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, to supply a wide range of weapons systems.
Moscow shoots down 4 US-made missiles
Russia’s defence ministry said over the past 24 hours its forces had shot down four US-made HARM anti-radiation missiles over the Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine, the state-run TASS news agency reported.
Putin casts what he calls Russia’s  “special military operation” in Ukraine as the moment when Moscow finally stood up to the US-led Western bloc seeking to capitalize on the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union by destroying Russia.
Kyiv and the West say that assertion is absurd and that Putin has no justification for what they see as an imperial-style war of aggression that has put Russia in control of around a fifth of Ukraine. Moscow said on Monday Russian and Chinese forces would hold joint naval drills between Dec 21 and Dec 27, involving missile and artillery firing in the East China Sea.

1,Netherlands PM apologises for 250 years of slavery,"Dutch PM Mark Rutte calls country's involvement in slavery a ""crime against humanity"".","THE HAGUE: Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Monday officially apologised for 250 years of the Netherlands’ involvement in slavery, calling it a  “crime against humanity”.
The apology comes almost 150 years after the end of slavery in the European country’s overseas colonies, which included Suriname and islands like Curacao and Aruba in the Caribbean and Indonesia in the East.
“Today on behalf of the Dutch government, I apologise for the past actions of the Dutch state,” Rutte said in a speech in The Hague.
“We, living in the here and now, can only recognise and condemn slavery in the clearest terms as a crime against humanity,” he said. Dutch ministers have travelled to seven former colonies in South America and the Caribbean for the event.
Sigrid Kaag, the Dutch finance minister and deputy prime minister, said on an official visit to Suriname last week that a  “process” would begin leading up to  “another incredibly important moment on July 1 next year”.
Descendants of Dutch slavery will then celebrate 150 years of liberation from slavery in an annual celebration called  “Keti Koti” (Breaking the Chains) in Surinamese.
But the plan has caused controversy, with groups and some of the affected countries criticising the move as rushed, and saying the lack of consultation by the Netherlands smacked of a colonial attitude. But Rutte in his speech on Monday said that choosing the right moment was a  “complicated matter”.
“There is not one right time for everyone, not one right word for everyone, not one right place for everyone,” he said.
The Dutch funded their  “Golden Age” of empire and culture in the 16th and 17th centuries by shipping around 600,000 Africans as part of the slave trade, mostly to South America and the Caribbean.
At the height of its colonial empire, the United Provinces known today as the Netherlands possessed colonies like Suriname, the Caribbean island of Curacao, South Africa and Indonesia, where the Dutch East India Company was based in the 17th century.

Many Rohingya risk their lives every year by attempting to reach Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia on rickety vessels, and their numbers have surged following deteriorating conditions in the camps and last year’s military coup in Myanmar.
The boat was first detect­ed by the Sri Lanka Navy when it was 3.5 nautical miles from shore and a search and rescue operation was launched to eventually tow the vessel to a northern harbour on Sunday night, a navy spokesperson, Captain Gayan Wickramasuriya, said.
“The people have been handed over to the police,” Wickramasuriya said.  “The police will present them before a magistrate who will decide the next step.”  A navy statement said it had 104 Myanmar nationals were found aboard a small trawler suspected to have originated from Myanmar and was heading to Indonesia when it ran into engine trouble in rough seas.

3,31 sailors go missing as Thai navy ship sinks,Some sailors survived by jumping into a life raft; 75 people have been rescued.,"PRACHUAP KHAN: Thai military frigates and helicopters kept up the search late on Monday for 31 sailors missing after a naval vessel sank, with dozens of others already hauled from the choppy waters.
The HTMS Sukhothai capsized late on Sunday as it was patrolling the Gulf of Thailand, about 37 kilometres off the Southeast Asian nation’s southeastern coast.
Some sailors survived by jumping into a life raft at night, according to images shared by the Royal Thai Navy, which said 75 people had been rescued.
Search and rescue teams continued to scour the waters for the 31 missing sailors, with emergency workers and naval personnel waiting at the windy pier. The operation involved two Seahawk helicopters, two frigates and one amphibious ship, the navy statement said.
A statement from the Royal Thai Air Force said they had assisted in the operation, without giving details. “Our main priority is searching and rescuing as many as we can,” naval commander Pichai Lorchusakul said at the pier.
The vessel is believed to have run into trouble after its electronics system was damaged, according to the navy. “The ship’s operating systems stopped working, causing the ship to lose control,” a spokesperson said.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-Cha said the cause of the incident was being investigated.
“I am following the news closely, about five people are seriously injured,” he added in a statement.
The navy said the search was still ongoing over an area measuring around 20 miles by 15 miles, concentrating on a section of sea roughly 18 miles south of the Sukhothai’s last position, and the area where the latest survivors were found.
One image shared by the navy showed the vessel capsized, while a video showed a rescue boat alongside the ship in rough waters. Other images shared on the navy’s Twitter account showed men wrapped in blankets following their rescue.
Some of those rescued were being airlifted to a hospital in Sattahip, while uninjured crew would be taken to a naval base.
Storms 
In one clip captured by local media, an unnamed crew member said he had to keep himself afloat for three hours before being rescued. “The waves were quite high, about three metres when the ship sank,” he said.
“I put on the life jacket and jumped. I swam for three hours,” he added, describing how one of the rescue vessels could not get close enough because of the waves.
Several areas in southern Thailand have been hit by storms and flooding in recent days.
The Thai metrological office said that strong winds were causing stormy conditions in the Gulf of Thailand, warning seafarers to proceed with caution and small boats to stay ashore.
The HTMS Sukhothai was commissioned in 1987 and built in the United States by the now-defunct Tacoma Boatbuilding Company, according to the US Naval Institute.
In 2018, a boat carrying mostly Chinese tourists capsized off Phuket island on Thailand’s west coast. More than 40 people died in the accident, one of the worst boat disasters in the country’s recent history.

4,Planet spiralling into star may offer glimpse into Earth’s end,PARIS: For the first time astronomers have identified a planet that is spiralling towards a cataclysmic collision...,"PARIS: For the first time astronomers have identified a planet that is spiralling towards a cataclysmic collision with its aging sun, potentially offering a glimpse into how Earth could end one day. 
In a new study published on Monday, a team of mostly US-based researchers said they hope the doomed exoplanet, Kepler-1658b, can help shed light on how worlds die as their stars get older. 
Kepler-1658b, which is 2,600 light years from Earth, is known as a “hot Jupiter” planet. 
While similar in size to Jupiter, the planet orbits its host star an eighth of the distance between our Sun and Mercury, making it far hotter than the gas giant in our own Solar System. 
Kepler-1658b’s orbit around its host star takes less than three days _ and it is getting shorter by around 131 milliseconds a year, according to the study published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters. 
“If it continues spiralling towards its star at the observed rate, the planet will collide with its star in less than three million years,” said Shreyas Vissapra­gada, a postdoc at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and the study’s lead author. 
“This is the first time we’ve observed direct evidence for a planet spiralling towards its evolved star,” he said. 
An evolved star is deemed to have entered the “subgiant” phase of the stellar life cycle when it starts expanding and becoming brighter. 
Kepler-1658b’s orbit is being shortened by the tides, in a similar process to how Earth’s oceans rise and fall every day. 
This gravitational push-and-pull can work both ways _ for example the Moon is very slowly spiralling away from Earth. 
Earth’s ultimate adios? 
So could Earth be heading towards a similar doom?  “Death-by-star is a fate thought to await many worlds and could be the Earth’s ultimate adios billions of years from now as our Sun grows older,” the Center for Astrophysics said in a statement. 
Vissapragada said “in five billion years or so, the Sun will evolve into a red giant star”. 
While the tidally-driven processes seen on Kepler-1658b  “will drive the decay of the Earth’s orbit towards the Sun”, that effect could be counter-balanced by the Sun losing mass, he said. “The ultimate fate of the Earth is somewhat unclear,” he added. 
Kepler-1658b was the first exoplanet ever observed by the Kepler space telescope, which launched in 2009.  
But it took nearly a decade of work before the planet’s existence was confirmed in 2019, the Center for Astrophysics said. 
Over 13 years, astronomers were able to observe the slow but steady change in the planet’s orbit as it crossed the face of its host star. 
One “big surprise” was that the planet itself is quite bright, Vissapragada said. 
Previously it had been thought this was because it is a particularly reflective planet, he said. 
But now the researchers believe the planet itself is far hotter than anticipated, possibly due to the same forces that are driving it towards its star.

5,Researchers discover over 100 ancient designs in Peru’s Nazca lines,"The geoglyphs, huge figures carved into the South American desert, date back more than 2,000 years.","

LIMA: More than a hundred new designs discovered in and around Peru’s ancient Nazca plain and surrounding areas could bring new information to light about the mysterious pre-Columbian artworks that have intrigued scientists and visitors for decades.
Following two years of field surveys with aerial photos and drones, Peruvian and Japanese researches from Yamagata University earlier this month reported the discovery of 168 new designs at the Unesco World Heritage site on Peru’s southern Pacific coast.
The geoglyphs, huge figures carved into the South American desert, date back more than 2,000 years and represent humans, cats, snakes, killer whales, birds and native camalids — animals such as llamas, guanacos and alpacas.
Jorge Olano, head archaeologist for the Nazca Lines research programme, said the new figures averaged between two and six meters (6.56 to 19.7 feet) in length. The purpose of the Nazca lines, which could only be seen from the air, remain a mystery.
This month’s findings, however, are smaller and can be seen from the ground, Masato Sakai, a professor from Yamagata University who led the study, said. The figures, iconic vestiges of Peru’s rich history, are about a three-hour drive from the capital Lima.
Researchers had already discovered 190 figures in the area since 2004. But the vastness of the terrain they cover has complicated efforts to study and conserve the heritage site.

6,US names Kennedy scion to Northern Ireland role,Joe Kennedy III has been given the title of special envoy to Northern Ireland for economic affairs.,"

WASHINGTON: President Joe Biden’s administration on Monday named Joe Kennedy III, a scion of the Irish American political dynasty, as an envoy on Northern Ireland.
Kennedy was given a title of special envoy to Northern Ireland for economic affairs with a focus on promoting investment and development.
The United States previously had a broader position of special envoy for Northern Ireland that started with former senator George Mitchell, who negotiated the landmark 1998 Good Friday agreement that largely ended decades of violence in the British-administered region.
Kennedy will look to promote development  “to the benefit of all communities” in Northern Ireland, historically divided between Protestants and Catholics, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.
“His role builds on the long-standing US commitment to supporting peace, prosperity and stability in Northern Ireland and the peace dividends of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement,” Blinken said in a statement.
Blinken said that other US diplomats will work on political efforts on Northern Ireland, where tensions have grown since Britain left the European Union, effectively restoring a border with EU member Ireland.
Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin voiced hope for progress on Northern Ireland ahead of next year’s 25th anniversary of the agreement.
Biden’s appointment of Kennedy  “is a clear demonstration of the president’s direct engagement with Ireland as well as the enduring US commitment to supporting peace in, and building the prosperity of, Northern Ireland,” Martin said in a statement.
Kennedy, the grandson of late senator Ted Kennedy, served in the House of Representatives until unsuccessfully seeking the Democratic nomination for a Senate seat in 2020.
His great-uncle John F. Kennedy was the first Catholic president and a hero of Biden, the second Catholic president, who often speaks fondly of his own Irish heritage.
The Kennedys remain active in Democratic politics with the late president’s daughter Caroline Kennedy serving under Biden as ambassador to Australia.
The new envoy’s great-grandfather, Joseph Kennedy, was ambassador to London at the start of World War II when he faced wide accusations of anti-British sentiment.

7,"Panel calls for charging Trump with fraud, insurrection","""An insurrection is a rebellion against the authority of the United States,"" says Representative Jamie Raskin.","WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives committee investigating the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol asked federal prosecutors on Monday to charge Donald Trump with obstruction and insurrection for his role in sparking the deadly riot.
The Democratic-led select committee’s request to the Justice Department is non-binding, but comes as a special counsel is overseeing two other federal probes of the Republican former president related to his attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat, and the removal of classified files from the White House.
The panel asked the Justice Department to charge Trump with obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, conspiracy to defraud the United States, making false statements and aiding or inciting and insurrection.
“An insurrection is a rebellion against the authority of the United States. It is a grave federal offence, anchored in the constitution itself,” said Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat on the select committee, as he announced the charges.
Monday’s meeting was the last final public gathering of a nine-member panel that spent 18 months probing the unprecedented attempt to prevent the peaceful transfer of power by thousands of Trump backers, inspired by his false claims that his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden was the result of widespread fraud.
The committee also said it referred four Republican House members, including Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, to the chamber’s ethics committee, for failing to comply with its legal subpoenas as it investigated the attack.
“If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again,” said Representative Bennie Thompson, the select committee’s chairperson, as the meeting began.
Slamming Trump for summoning the mob to the Capitol nearly two years ago, Thompson also criticised the former president for undermining faith in the democratic system.
“If the faith is broken, so is our democracy. Donald Trump broke that faith,” Thompson said.
Trump has already launched a campaign to seek the Republican nomination to run for the White House again in 2024.
Series of investigations 
The select committee’s work is one of a series of investigations into the riot. Five people, including a police officer, died during or shortly after the incident and more than 140 police officers were injured. The Capitol suffered millions of dollars in damage.
“Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings, was the President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office, watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television,” Representative Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the committee and its vice chairperson, said.
A jury has already found members of the right-wing Oath Keepers militia guilty of sedition for their role in the attack. Special counsel Jack Smith was appointed last month to lead federal probes into Trump.

8,Four Iranian security personnel killed in attack,TEHRAN: A ‘terrorist’ attack killed four members of Iran’s security forces in a southeastern region beset by...,"TEHRAN: A ‘terrorist’ attack killed four members of Iran’s security forces in a southeastern region beset by anti-government protests as well as extremist and criminal unrest, official media reported on Monday.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members were killed  “during a terrorist act” in the Saravan region of Sistan-Baluchistan province near the Pakistani border, the state IRNA news agency said.
The region is one of Iran’s poorest and is home to the Baluchi minority, who adhere to Sunni Islam rather than the Shia branch predominant in Iran.
On Sunday, the head of the Saravan border guards, Hosseinali Farahi, reported a clash between his forces and  “armed aggressors who were members of a terrorist group”.
The area has previously seen clashes with drug smuggling gangs as well as rebels from the Baluchi minority and Sunni extremist groups. Earlier this month a cleric was killed after being kidnapped from his mosque in Khash, a town in Sistan-Baluchistan.
A chief prosecutor said last week that the killers of cleric Abdulwahed Rigi had been arrested before trying to cross the border, and accused them of seeking to stir trouble between Sunnis and Shias.
Violence erupted in the provincial capital Zahedan on Sept 30 and authorities said six members of the security forces were among the dozens of people killed.
Local figures said the protests in Zahedan were triggered by anger over the reported rape of a teenage girl by a police officer. Overseas-based activists accused security forces of firing on demonstrators.
Clerics attacked 
The casualties came against the backdrop of nationwide unrest that followed the Sept 16 death of Mahsa Amini, 22, after her arrest in Tehran by morality police who accused her of violating Iran’s dress code for women.
Last month a delegation from Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei expressed sadness and promised solutions in a visit to the area, official media said at the time.
In violence elsewhere in Iran, IRNA reported that four clerics were wounded by unknown assailants armed with a  “sharp object” in Qom, south of Tehran.
Two of them were treated at the scene for injuries, while the other two were taken to hospital but expected to be released, IRNA said.
Iran has executed two men it said were convicted of violence against security force members in connection with the nationwide protests.
Majidreza Rahnavard, 23, was hanged in public after being sentenced to death by a court in the northeastern city of Mashhad for killing two members of the security forces with a knife, the judiciary’s Mizan Online news agency reported last week.
Four days earlier Iran executed Mohsen Shekari, also 23, for wounding a member of the security forces. It was the first announced case of the death penalty being used against a protester.

A total of 57.5 per cent of more than 17 million accounts voted for him to step down. Musk, who is also the boss of car maker Tesla and rocket firm SpaceX, has not yet responded.
Musk has fully owned Twitter since Oct 27 and has repeatedly courted controversy as CEO, sacking half of its staff, readmitting far-right figures to the platform, banning journalists and trying to charge for previously free services.
Analysts have also pointed out that the stock price of Tesla has slumped by one-third since the Twitter takeover and the share price briefly rallied by 3.3pc on Monday before fading.
“It’s hard to ignore the numbers since [Twitter] deal closed,” tweeted investment expert Gary Black, saying he reckoned Tesla’s board was putting pressure on Musk to quit his Twitter role.
In discussions with users after posting his latest poll, Musk claimed he had no successor in mind and renewed his warnings that the platform could be heading for bankruptcy.
The unpredictable billionaire posted the poll shortly after trying to extricate himself from yet another 
controversy.
On Sunday, Twitter users were told they would no longer be able to promote content from other social media sites.

10,Scientists freeze Great Barrier Reef coral in world-first trial,Scientists are scrambling to protect coral reefs as rising ocean temperatures destabilise delicate ecosystems.,"

SYDNEY: Scientists working on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef have successfully trialled a new method for freezing and storing coral larvae they say could eventually help rewild reefs threatened by climate change.
Scientists are scrambling to protect coral reefs as rising ocean temperatures destabilise delicate ecosystems. The Great Barrier Reef has suffered four bleaching events in the last seven years including the first ever bleach during a La Nina phenomenon, which typically brings cooler temperatures.
Cryogenically frozen coral can be stored and later reintroduced to the wild but the current process requires sophisticated equipment including lasers. Scientists say a new lightweight  “cryomesh” can be manufactured cheaply and better preserves coral.
In a December lab trial, the world’s first with Great Barrier Reef coral, scientists used the cryomesh to freeze coral larvae at the Australian Institute of Marine Sciences (AIMS). The coral had been collected from the reef for the trial, which coincided with the brief annual spawning window.
“If we can secure the biodiversity of coral then we’ll have tools for the future to really help restore the reefs and this technology for coral reefs in the future is a real game-changer,” Mary Hagedorn, Senior Research Scientist at Smithsonian National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute said from the AIMS lab.
The cryomesh was previously trialled on smaller and larger varities of Hawaiian corals. A trial on the larger variety failed. Trials are continuing with larger varieties of Great Barrier Reef coral.
The trials involved scientists from AIMS, the Smithsonian National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute, the Great Barrier Reef foundation and the Taronga Conservation Society Australia as part of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program.
The mesh technology, which will help store coral larvae at -196C (-320.8F), was devised by a team from the University of Minnesotas College of Science and Engineering, including Dr Zongqi Guo, a postdoctoral associate, and Professor John C. Bischov. It was first tested on corals by PHD student Nikolas Zuchowicz.
This new technology that we’ve got will allow us to do that at a scale that can actually help to support some of the aquaculture and restoration interventions, said Jonathan Daly of the Taronga Conservation Society Australia.

11,Swedish court  blocks extradition of journalist sought by Erdogan,"STOCKHOLM: Sweden’s Supreme Court on Monday blocked the extradition of exiled Turkish journalist Bulent Kenes, a...","STOCKHOLM: Sweden’s Supreme Court on Monday blocked the extradition of exiled Turkish journalist Bulent Kenes, a key demand by Ankara to ratify Stockholm’s Nato membership.
There were  “several hindrances” to sending back the former editor-in-chief of the Zaman daily, who Turkiye accuses of being involved in a 2016 attempt to topple President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the court said.
Some of the accusations against Kenes are not crimes in Sweden, which along with the political nature of the case and his refugee status, made extradition impossible, the court added.
“There is also a risk of persecution based on this person’s political beliefs. An extradition can thusly not take place,” judge Petter Asp said in a statement.
As a result,  “the government... is not able to grant the extradition request.” Kenes is the only person Erdogan has identified by name among dozens of people Ankara wants extradited in exchange for approving Sweden’s Nato membership.
Following decades — or in Sweden’s case centuries — of staying out of a military alliance, the two countries made the historic decision to apply to join Nato after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Apart from Hungary, which is due to ratify Sweden’s and Finland’s membership in early 2023, Turkiye is the only country to threaten to prevent the two countries from joining Nato.
Turkiye, which has accused Sweden especially of providing a safe haven for outlawed Kurdish groups it deems  “terrorists” has held back on ratifying their Nato applications despite  reach­ing an agreement with Sweden and Finland in June.
Ankara says it expects Stockholm in particular to take tougher action on several issues, including the extradition of criminals.
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson travelled to Turkiye in November to meet Erdogan to discuss the issues.
When pressed about  “terrorists” he wants extradited from Sweden during a joint press conference, Erdogan only named Kenes as one on the list.
Stockholm has repeatedly stressed that its judiciary is independent and has the final say in extraditions.
In early December, Sweden extradited to Turkiye a convicted member of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), who had fled to Sweden in 2015 but had his asylum request denied.

The ISIE electoral authority had initially announced participation of 8.8pc after the close of voting for a parliament largely stripped of any power, the final pillar in Saied’s overhaul of the political system in the birthplace of the Arab Spring uprisings.
ISIE chief Farouk Bouasker told journalists in Tunis that just over one million of the North African nation’s nine million registered voters had cast ballots.
The figure is the lowest since the 2011 revolution that overthrew dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, down from 70pc in 2014 legislative polls and just a third of the 30.5 percent in this summer’s vote on a new constitution cementing Saied’s authority.
Saied sacked the government, surrounded parliament with tanks and seized full executive powers in July 2021, and has since moved to reinstall a system concentrating almost unlimited power in the hands of the president.

13,Amber Heard settles defamation case with Johnny Depp,WASHINGTON: Actress Amber Heard announced on Monday that she had made the  “very difficult” decision to settle...,"WASHINGTON: Actress Amber Heard announced on Monday that she had made the  “very difficult” decision to settle the multimillion dollar defamation case brought by her former husband Johnny Depp.
Heard, in a post on Instagram, did not reveal the terms of the settlement, which comes after a Virginia jury ordered her to pay $10 million to the  “Pirates of the Caribbean” star.
The entertainment website TMZ, citing sources with direct knowledge, said the settlement calls for the 36-year-old Heard to pay $1 million to her 59-year-old former husband.
Heard, who had a starring role in the movie  “Aquaman,” said she was dropping her appeal of the damages awarded by the jury and settling the case because she  “simply cannot go through” another trial.
“After a great deal of deliberation I have made a very difficult decision to settle the defamation case,” she said.
“I make this decision having lost faith in the American legal system, where my unprotected testimony served as entertainment and social media fodder,” she said.
“Now I finally have an opportunity to emancipate myself from something I attempted to leave over six years ago and on terms I can agree to,” she said.
“I have made no admission. This is not an act of concession.” The jury found Depp and Heard liable for defamation — but sided more strongly with the  “Pirates” star following an intense six-week trial riding on bitterly contested allegations of domestic abuse.
The jury awarded $10.35 million in damages to Depp. Heard, who had countersued, was awarded $2 million.
‘Defended my truth’ 
Depp sued Heard over an op-ed she wrote for The Washington Post in December 2018 in which she described herself as a  “public figure representing domestic abuse.” The Texas-born Heard did not name Depp in the piece, but he sued her for implying he was a domestic abuser and sought $50 million in damages.
Heard countersued for $100 million, saying she was defamed by statements made by Depp’s lawyer, Adam Waldman, who told the Daily Mail her abuse claims were a  “hoax.” The case, live streamed to millions, featured lurid and intimate details about the Hollywood celebrities’ private lives. Heard’s lawyers said following the trial that the actress did not have the resources to pay Depp the $10 million in damages.
In her Instagram post, Heard said she  “defended my truth and in doing so my life as I knew it was destroyed.
“The vilification I have faced on social media is an amplified version of the ways in which women are revictimised when they come forward,” she said. “I was exposed to a type of humiliation that I simply cannot relive.
“Even if my US appeal is successful, the best outcome would be a retrial where a new jury would have to consider the evidence again,” she said.  “I simply cannot go through that for a third time.”
