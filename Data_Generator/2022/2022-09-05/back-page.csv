0,FOOTPRINTS: WIPED FROM EXISTENCE,"The sense of loss cannot be exaggerated here; imagine standing at the spot where your house once stood, but now there is nothing.","Mouza Kocha Kakari — a settlement near the Kachhi Canal — was once home to 20 villages and rice fields stretching as far as the eye could see.
Today, it looks like a barren wasteland, with no traces left of the homes that once dotted the landscape.
As we make our way down the road from Kala Colony to Basti Gaadi, the road suddenly vanishes after crossing the Kachi Canal bridge. Any remnants of the road are now burried under sand, silt and sediment deposited by hill torrents that raged down from the Koh-i-Suleman mountains after record monsoon rains battered the area for weeks.
This road, which connects several villages to the Indus Highway, is piled with six to seven feet of sand and mud. Although flood water has dissipated, the landscape is still buried under metres of riverine deposits.
The sense of loss cannot be exaggerated here; imagine standing at the spot where your house once stood, but now there is nothing. The only remaining signs that a human settlement once existed here are the half buried upper stories and iron gates of a handful of concrete houses.
The road to Basti Gaadi was dotted with villages and settlements, but after travelling a few kilometres on the sand-covered terrain, we came across the remains of Basti Bakhowala, where the flood-hit population has set up a city of tents where hundreds of the displaced have found shelter.
There were 25 houses in Basti Bakhowala, but the only one still visible was a two-room house, buried up to the roshandaan in six to seven feet of sediment.
Karam Husain, in his 60s, was standing on the dunes of sand left behind by the floods. When we met him, he was trying to find a trace of where his home had been.
“There were 25 to 30 houses in the basti. There are 17 of us, and the whole family spent Aug 14 at home. But just two days later, it was gone; buried under the sand.”

He said the level of destruction they witnessed was unprecedented in living memory.
“In my 60 years, I have never witnessed flood damage to our house. Even the stories my father told me had nothing to compare with this catastrophe.”
It was a similar story in Basti Ghaziwala just down the road, where nearly 40 homes vanished from existence, gobbled up by elements.
Travelling further down this road is perilous as it is filled with yawning trenches. Sections of the concrete thoroughfare have disappeared, making it tough going for travellers. It is the same story for village after village.
On the road to Taunsa, north of Kala Colony, two to three feet of standing water still remains. The villages of Mangrotha and Sokar were quite badly hit; the latter saw at least 400 of its total 600 residences damaged beyond repair. Most locals are now forced to spend their nights in the collapsed shells of their homes.
The locality also has a primary and middle school, which were also badly damaged — their boundary walls knocked down and the building riddled with cracks.
Here, we encountered a woman waving her NIC around, calling to every passer-by that she was a widow and should be registered for flood compensation.
She said the locals, government and NGOs had given her enough food for daily use, but she did not have a place to save these items as half of her house had collapsed and she was living in the damaged portion.
“I did not need any food at this time but the government should help us rebuild our house, as winter is approaching and my family would have to live under the open sky,” she said.
Mangrotha was inundated by water from the Sanghar drain, and nearly a third of the town was gone, wiped from existence. Locals said that the flood washed away around 270 houses, while others were quite badly damaged.
Umar Buzdar, a resident of the town, told Dawn this was one of the biggest settlements in Taunsa and was situated in a low-lying area.
He said that more than a 1,000 of people were now homeless, either living with relatives in nearby areas, or camped out in the local school building.

1,"Defence system installed in 51Iranian cities to thwart biological, chemical threats",Announcement comes as Iran is engaged in negotiations to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.,"TEHRAN: Iranian authorities have introduced defence systems in 51 cities to counter “biological, radiological and chemical threats”, Deputy Defence Minister Mehdi Farahi has announced.
The defence ministry has “provided 51 cities in the country with the necessary installations and equipment for passive defence”, Mr Farahi was cited as saying by Irib news, the state broadcaster’s website.
He said the country was “now able to identify the threats thanks to the infrastructure put in place to confront all sorts of biological, radiological and chemical threats”.
The announcement comes as Iran is engaged in negotiations to revive its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that granted the country much-needed sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.
As momentum builds to restore the deal, Israel has been waging a last-minute push to convince allies to halt talks.
On Aug 28, Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid said instructions had been given to the army and the Mossad spy agency to “prepare for any scenario” in the event that the deal is passed.
In March 2021, Iran’s former defence minister Amir Hatami had said the Islamic republic should be ready to defend itself against nuclear, chemical and biological attacks. 
“We must be ready to defend our nation against all threats and anything that the enemy could one day use as a tool for attack,” he said at an event commemorating a 1987 chemical attack against Iranian Kurds by former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
“These include (attacks using) chemical, nuclear and biological weapons,” Hatami added, according to Fars news agency.
Meanwhile, Iran arrested 12 suspects for their alleged links with the Islamic republic’s arch enemy Israel, state media reported.

2,"Over 450 children among victims as toll touches 1,290","1,200 medical camps being set up in flood-hit districts; PM appeals to Unicef, other agencies to help control children's deaths.","ISLAMABAD: Over 1,200 medical relief camps are being set up in more than 20 flood-hit districts this month to provide medical assistance, including first aid for water-borne diseases and cold fever, to affected citizens, the health minister said on Sunday.
The overnight death toll from the floods rose by 25, including 12 children, taking the overall casualties to 1,290 since mid-June, according to National Flood Response Coordination Centre (NFRCC) data.
At these medical camps, “basic health services will be provided with free medicines, vaccination of eligible children, and treatment of vector-borne and water-borne diseases (diarrhoea and enteric fever),” Health Minister Abdul Qadir Patel said in a statement. “The medicines for skin disease, eye infections, anti-diarrhoea, and water purification tablets will also be provided.”
Two medical relief camps (one mobile and one static) will be set up for 25 days in each of the affected district.

1,200 medical camps being set up in flood-hit districts

The camps will be set up in six districts of Balochistan (Jafarabad/Nasirabad, Sohbatpur, Jhal Magsi, Bolan, Musakhel and Harnai), eight districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Dera Ismail Khan, Peshawar, Tank, Nowshera, Charsadda, Swat, Shangla, Lower Dir), two districts of Punjab (Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur); and six districts in Sindh (Qambar Shahdadkot/Larkana, Sukkur/Khairpur, Dadu, Naushero Feroze, Sanghar/Badin and Shikarpur/Kashmore).
The minister  said the primary goal of the camps, being established in collaboration with the National Emergency Operation Cell and Aga Khan University, was to provide flood victims with on-ground medical aid.
Health Ministry Spokesman Sajid Shah told Dawn that efforts were being made to help the provincial health system as much as possible.
“We have sent medical teams from Islamabad to the provinces so that the flood victims could get medical treatment,” he said.
According to an NFRCC update on Sunday, 25 deaths and 11 injuries related to floods were reported during the last 24 hours, taking the overall death toll to 1,290, including more than 450 children.
Record monsoon rains have caused devastating floods across the country since mid June, leaving almost a third of the country under water and affecting the lives of 33 million people.
The hardest hit are the poors in rural parts of the country, who have seen their homes, belongings, life savings, livestocks and crops washed away.
The United Nations children’s agency Unicef has said there was a risk of “many more” child deaths from diseases that will spread after floods.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday appealed to the Unicef and other global agencies to help control the deaths of children.
“As Pakistan battles one of the worst climate-induced calamities, among the most adversely affected are children,” he tweeted.

3,"Five Israeli soldiers, driver injured as Palestinians attack bus",Turkish warship docks in Israel as ties warm up.,"JORDAN VALLEY: Palesti­nians fired on an Israeli bus on a desert highway in the occupied West Bank on Sunday, Israeli military authorities and medics said, wounding five soldiers and the driver in an attack that suggested violence may be spiralling anew.
The attack was carried out on the day when Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz nominated Major General Herzi Halevi as the country’s next army chief.
The incident, in which authorities said two suspected gunmen were detained as they tried to escape, took place within driving distance of Jenin and Nablus, Palestinian cities that have seen months of intensive and often lethal Israeli security sweeps.
Witnesses said Palestinians in a car overtook the bus, spraying it with bullets and, when it came to a halt, tried to torch it. Israeli TV aired footage of a car ablaze after, it said, a firebomb went off inside.

Turkish warship docks in Israel as ties warm up

There was no immediate Palestinian claim of responsibility, but a spokesman for Hamas praised the attack as “proof that all attempts by the Occupation (Israel) to stop the escalating resistance operations in the West Bank have failed”.
Israel has stepped up raids in the West Bank in recent months after several deadly attacks by Palestinians in its cities between March and May.
Ram Ben-Barak, head of the Israeli parliament’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, said he hoped for a peace accord with the PA but described this prospect as unfeasible as of now. “The situation is very sensitive and explosive, on the one hand, while on the other we are seeing growing numbers of Palestinians who understand that the way forward is not one of violence,” Ben-Barak told Israel’s Army Radio.
Israel, he added, would respond “very forcefully ... while enabling those who don’t want to turn to terrorism to continue with their routine lives”.
Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz nominated Major General Herzi Halevi as the country’s next army chief, his office said on Sunday.
The nomination of Halevi, who serves as deputy to outgoing Chief of General Staff Aviv Kohavi, will be discussed by an advisory committee in the coming days before the government gives its approval, Gantz’s office said.
Halevi is due to take up his new position in February next year, the defence ministry said.
Turkish warship docks in Israel 
Earlier, a Turkish warship docked in Israel for the first such visit in more than a decade as relations between the US allies improve following fierce feuding over the Palestinian cause.
The frigate Kemalreis docked in Haifa as part of Nato manoeuvres in the Mediterranean sea, a Turkish official said. An official of Haifa port said it was the first time a Turkish naval vessel had visited since at least 2010, when bilateral ties were shattered by Israel’s storming of a pro-Palestinian aid convoy that tried to breach its blockade of the Gaza Strip.
Ten Turks were killed by Israeli marines in that incident.
For its part, Israel has voiced objections at Nato-member Turkey’s hosting of members of Hamas, a Palestinian movement that is proscribed as a terrorist group in the West.
But the countries have moved to mend their relationship in recent months, with energy emerging as a key area for potential cooperation. They are expected to appoint new ambassadors soon.
Capital punishment
Meanwhile, Gaza’s ruling Hamas authorities executed five Pales­tinians on Sunday, two of them on charges of espionage for Israel that dated back to 2015 and 2009, the interior ministry said.
The executions at dawn, by hanging or firing squad, were the first in the Palestinian territories since 2017. Past cases of capital punishment being carried out in Gaza have drawn criticism from human rights groups.
The ministry statement did not provide full names for any of the condemned men. It said three had been convicted of murder. The two convicted spies, aged 44 and 54, had given Israel information that led to the killing of Palestinians, it said.
The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office, which oversees the country’s intelligence services, declined comment.
“The execution was carried out after the conclusion of all legal procedures. The rulings had been final, with implementation mandatory, after all of the convicted were accorded full rights to defend themselves,” the statement said.
Since Hamas took control of Gaza, its courts have sentenced around 180 Palestinians to death, and have executed 33 so far, the PCHR said.

4,"ANALYSIS: Truss will win, but at what cost","“[The leadership race] has damaged the party,” says  Dr M. Rodwan Abouharb.","


 
THE United Kingdom’s new prime minister will be revealed to the world today (Monday) after an intense battle, but the cost of picking Boris Johnson’s successor has had serious repercussions for the Conservative party.
The past few weeks were marked by vicious debates between Liz Truss — who has consistently been ahead in polls — and Rishi Sunak, who has now been dubbed a ‘backstabber’ after months of fawning. In fact, the Tory leadership race has hurt both candidates so badly that a poll last week showed swing voters would prefer Johnson, whose favourability had dropped to the lowest ever score in early July.
Both candidates tore into the other’s campaigns during the debate to win the top slot, but their attacks were essentially an indictment of the Tory government’s performance. The debate environment was hostile and lacked substance, as both pandered to the Tory right. 
They lambasted each other’s policies on China, on Brexit and the cost of living — even each other’s backgrounds. Truss said Sunak took the UK economy in the “wrong direction” when he was chancellor. Sunak said Truss’ plans to curb Bank of England’s spending could “spook international investors”. “I mean, give them another half-hour, and they could have dispatched not only their entire party to the bonfire of terrible ideas, but the nation itself,” wrote Guardian columnist Zoe Williams.

The process that led to replacing Boris Johnson has cost the party; the leader-to-be has serious internal and national challenges before her

“[The leadership race] has damaged the party,” Dr M. Rodwan Abouharb tells Dawn. The Associate Professor in International Relations at University College London (UCL) added, “There were many ‘blue on blue’ attacks. It was a bruising and divisive race, the winner now needs to bring together a fractious and exhausted party.”
Dr Abouharb touches on what is widely believed to be the ongoing confusion within the party.
“The problem for the Tory Party is that Liz Truss was favoured by the members while Rishi Sunak was favoured by the Conservative Party MPs, precisely because they are thinking about the next election. Liz Truss is a gift for the Labour Party trying to win the next election.”
Though Rishi was once touted as ‘the next British PM’, a campaign in disarray that featured weak policy decisions and blistering attacks on his fellow party member-cum opponent-may have sealed his fate.
“It could have been a vicious race, but Mr Sunak’s poor performance in an early televised debate allowed Liz Truss to entrench her already-established lead,” Dr Helen Brown Cover­dale, Lecturer in Political Theory at UCL, tells Dawn.
“The Conservative party has always had problems with divisions, and has been divided on what the relationship between the UK and its European neighbours should be for well over 40 years. What has been divisive is that both candidates have been making public speeches in order to win the votes of the most hardline Conservative party members, which [is] likely to alienate the vast majority of citizens who have no say at all in this current race to establish their new prime minister.”
However, she added that though Sunak is “the better communicator of the two candidates, the task ahead will be a difficult one for any Conservative party leader.
‘Truss deficit’
The serving secretary of state for Foreign, Common­wealth and Development Affairs since 2021 and Minister for Women and Equalities since 2019, Truss has been a conservative party MP from South West Norfolk since 2010.
She is often described as a ‘shape-shifter’, because while she earlier fought for Britain to remain in the European Union, she is now a staunch defender of Brexit. Not only does she have plenty of government experience, she is a foreign policy hawk who is popular amongst the Tory right.
Since making the final round, though she has led every poll of the membership by impressive margins, polling by Opinium for the Observer showed that whereas 49 per cent of people who voted Tory in 2019 believed Truss “looks like a prime minister in waiting” at the beginning of August, that figure had dropped to just 31pc by August 30.
Not only is Truss seen as less likable the more she engages in public speaking, she has serious challenges to tackle: the enormous increase in energy prices leading to a recession, a fractured NHS, and the ongoing war in Ukraine.
“The rising costs of energy will be the biggest challenge,” says Dr Coverdale.
“There are other factors driving the rising cost of living in the UK, and many factors driving the rising costs of energy across Europe. There is some protection for families in the UK, although very many people will struggle to pay their heating bills this winter. However, small business are particularly at risk, with energy prices forecast to rise by over three and a half times the cost of the previous year.”
