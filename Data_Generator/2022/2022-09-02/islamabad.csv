Mr Irshad said that if on his next visit,he found encroachments, wrong parking, disorderly traffic and poor traffic arrangements then circle in-charges will be responsible and strict action will be taken against them.
He further said that all circle in-charges should inspect their circles, sector and beat in-charges should maintain the flow of traffic while patrolling and ensure compliance with traffic rules in all cases.
Due to poor performance of traffic wardens, mushrooming of encroachments, lack of parking space and public complaints have forced the CTO to conduct surprise visits of the city to observe the worsening traffic situation in the city by himself and to take action.

3,Effectiveness of NA depends on performance of members: speakers,ISLAMABAD: Speakers at a seminar on Thursday said members of National Assembly (MNAs) should ensure effectiveness of...,"ISLAMABAD: Speakers at a seminar on Thursday said members of National Assembly (MNAs) should ensure effectiveness of parliament.
They said National Assembly can be just as effective as members wish to make it or as ineffective as members wish to do so.
This was stated at a Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT) briefing session organised to showcase a report on the performance of the fourth year of the 15th National Assembly.
Presenting an overview of the performance of assembly, Pildat President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob said successive leaders did not prioritise parliament beyond their electorate which was reflected in the lack of relevance of the parliament.
“One can partly understand that since delivery of required state services is not effective, members of parliament use a majority of their time in working as a conduit to facilitate their services. However, the parliament remains of supreme importance within the structure of democracy,” he said.
Presenting key statistics from the working of 15th National Assembly in fourth year, he said the assembly could not complete on average 59pc agenda in its sittings.
“If one looks at what it costs taxpayers to run the assembly, the per MNA cost has become Rs16.32 million. The per sitting cost is Rs64.15 million and the cost of a working hour stands at Rs31.35 million,” he said.
Mr Mehboob said sharing the budget and costs was not to suggest that it was costly to run the assembly but that emphasise must be paid on improving its performance. This would not be possible untilcitizens hold parliament to account, he said.
Journalist Tahir Khalil said that performance of the parliament had to be reviewed in historical perspective of frequent disruptions of parliamentary democracy.
“There is a particular mindset that does not let parliament flourish,” he said.
Secretary Parliamentary Reporters Association Asif Bashir Choudhry said strange and unprecedented things had happened in the fourth year of the 15thNational Assembly, including its dissolution and speaker rejecting the resolution of the vote of no-confidence which eventually had to be decided by the Supreme Court.
“There is such lack of tolerance that if a party cannot retain government, it refuses to sit in the National Assembly. Why has the speaker accepted partial and not all resignations of PTI MNAs is also inexplicable. A large number of laws are passed under an hour or legislation is carried out by ordinances. Local government not on the agenda of any major political party,” he said.
Other speakers said with each passing year, parliament appears to be more and more irrelevant in the larger scheme of democracy in Pakistan.
They said beyond quantitative analysis of laws, one must also view quality of debate and of legislation in the assembly to get a complete picture. Same is true of meeting the constitutional requirement of 130 days which is meaningless. Until decisions are made inside the parliament, it will remain irrelevant.

9,Nadra biker service launched to facilitate applicants,"Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah briefed about Nadra's operations in Sindh, Balochistan and south Punjab.","ISLAMABAD: Minister for Interior Rana Sanaullah on Thursday launched the Nadra biker service for carrying out processes of CNIC renewal and modification at the doorsteps of applicants.
During his visit to the Nadra headquarters, the authority’s chairman Tariq Malik briefed the minister about its operations in Sindh, Balochistan and south Punjab which have been badly affected by devastating floods and heavy rains.
The minister was informed that the monsoon rains and floods had caused heavy losses to most of the buildings of NRCs which were inundated by floodwater; however, the equipment has been saved and evacuated. Houses of 150 Nadra employees in those areas have been damaged.
Moreover, during the briefing, the chairman Nadra informed the minister that more than 37 million people have been affected due to floods and rains. He said heavy rains and flooding in certain areas had led to the loss of CNICs of affected people which would be needed to have an access to government’s relief disbursement and other activities.
With regard to the biker service, Mr Malik said initially the pilot phase of the service would be available in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. By the end of December this year, the biker service would be extended to all the districts of the country, he added.
He said the biker service was basically a portable Nadra centre that will walk into people’s lounges and register them on their premises saving them from the hassle of visiting the Nadra centres. Through this service, the female registration officers using scooties will also carry out registration of women.
Mr Malik told the minister that he had been working on out-of-box solutions with a prime focus on creating hand-on facilitation and hassle-free registration for general public in a bid to accommodate more than 125,000 footfall daily at 771 Nadra centres across the country.
Long queues at Nadra registration centres, especially in major cities led him to go an extra mile by successfully establishing 97 new NRCs and adding more than 100 new MRVs in the existing fleet within past 10 months.
The interior minister said the Nadra chairman had set a new benchmark globally by creating public facilitation regime through the implementation of international standards and world’s best practices at Nadra.
He said after a wide network of Nadra registration centres (NRCs), mobile registration vans (MRVs) and online Pak identity service/mobile app to cater to register citizens, the introduction of the Nadra biker shall bring Nadra’s services to people’s homes.
The minister directed the chairman that facilities should be introduced in small towns across all provinces. Nadra biker service is a great facility and its network should be spread throughout the country, said the minister.
The minister also directed that the scope of online facilities for overseas Pakistanis should also be expanded. He asked the chairman to develop an automated system to register newborn children.

The meeting was chaired by Senator Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, who belongs to Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf.
The committee was discussing the Prime University of Nursing Sciences Technology Islamabad Bill, 2022 presented by Senator Naseebullah Bazai and the Pakistan Pharmacy (Amendment) Bill, 2022 moved by Senator Mustaq Ahmed Khan.
The Adviser HEC briefed the committee on the proposed Prime University of Nursing Sciences Technology, Islamabad and apprised that the university submitted a feasibility report to HEC for grant of No objection Certificate (NOC) in light f the guidelines for the Establishment of a new University or an Institute of Higher Education, which is under the process of evaluation/initial scrutiny. 
He said that upon meeting all requirements and competition of all modalities, including physical inspection and issuance of HEC’s NOC, the charter of the proposed institute will be vetted as per federal universities ordinances (FUO), 2002 and forwarded to the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training for processing and enactment from the Nation Assembly of Pakistan.
Senator Mushtaq, after seeking permission of the chair to speak over the issue as he is not the member of the committee and reached there to defend his bill, said that unfortunately quality of higher education was continuously declining and he held the HEC responsible for it.
While speaking in the meeting and later talking to Dawn, senator Mushtaq said that around eight months ago HEC held a survey in five universities to gauge the quality of education.
“Survey was held in Quaid-i-Azam University, Punjab University, Karachi University, Balochistan University and Peshawar University. As per formula, it was revealed that not a single university fulfilled 50pc criterion and some even could not achieved 30pc points. It shows that the HEC is not functioning properly. One should imagine that what will be the quality of Bacha Khan University,” he said.
Senator Mushtaq said that things were further deteriorated after 18th Amendment as provinces lacked capacity to deal with universities.
The Chairman Committee directed the Advisor HEC to expedite the process on corresponding the observations found in the initial scrutiny and give a final verdict whether or not the university fulfils the required criteria for NOC , he said that once this process is done other considerations will fall in place with accordance to the Ministry’s decision. 
The Committee urged to delay the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Tests (MDCAT) by at least two months, whether to be conducted provincially or federally.
The Chairman Committee said that the exams should also be conducted as per the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council Bill, which is yet to be passed.
“Since the bill will pass eventually, we support the government in the larger interest of students. There is no point in impeding the process and keeping the students in an uncertain position,” he said.
