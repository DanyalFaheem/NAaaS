0,Complacency unaffordable for Pakistan in do-or-die clash against Hong Kong,Winning the match will take Pakistan to the Super 4 stage.,"SHARJAH: It is going to be do-or-die for Pakistan when they take on minnows Hong Kong for the first time in the shortest format in their second and final Asia Cup T20 group stage fixture here at the iconic Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Friday.
Winning the match will take Pakistan to the Super 4 stage, which will feature the top two sides from each group competing on a single league basis. 
Having lost to arch-rivals India narrowly in their opener, Pakistan captain Babar Azam and their management staff would be vary of being too complacent in a game which could have allowed them to rest their main players, had the result on Sunday been the other way round.
The match against India saw pacer Naseem Shah suffer with cramps that may be credited to the hot and humid conditions in Dubai. Fast bowler Haris Rauf too didn’t look completely fit.
Though there were no injuries reported following the match, it has to be seen if Pakistan try to protect the currently available pacemen, especially after losing spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi and Mohammad Wasim Jr. before their Asia Cup campaign got underway.
Naseem and Haris also took part in Paki­stan’s practice session late on Wedn­esday night. Right-armer Mohammad Hasnain, who returned to the national side after being cleared for his bowling action, is also an option the Pakistan think-tank can use if one of the first-choice fast bowlers is rested. 
In the net practice session, Babar reportedly observed batter Haider Ali’s power-hitting. The 21-year-old right han­der is believed to be in contention for a start against Hong Kong with Pakistan’s middle-order failing to impress against India.
All-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed was the only notable performer in the middle of the line-up, scoring 28 off 22. The likes of Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz and Khushdil Shah also failed to do well before tailenders Haris and Shahnawaz Dahani took Pakistan to a respectable total with their cameos.
Haider, being a specialist batsman unlike the all-round quartet, may give Pakistan the stability they require if openers Babar or Mohammad Rizwan leave the crease early.
Fakhar Zaman, who walked out after his dismissal against India went unnoticed by the opponents and the umpire, will also be expected to regain form.
The explosive left-hander believed Pakistan should try not to repeat the mistakes they made in the first match.
“It was a tight game against India, the morale is high in the camp and all our players are confident of doing better in the upcoming game,” Fakhar was said in a Pakistan Cricket Board news release. 
“T20 is a short format which provides an equal opportunity for both teams to show-case their strengths. 
“To aim for the Super 4 we have to ensure we minimise our errors and put up a good show.”
Fakhar, who has played 66 Twenty20 Internationals, was aware of what Hong Kong brought to the table. The side, after impressing in the Asia Cup qualifiers, showed their quality with the bat against India on Wednesday despite losing the game by 40 runs. 
“Hong Kong has played good cricket in the qualifiers but we will try to stick to our plans,” said Fakhar.
The Mardan-born batsman acknowledged the weather in the United Arab Emirates posed a challenge to the players’ fitness but said the squad was acting accordingly. 
“The weather is hot here in the UAE but we are trying to keep ourselves hydrated,” he said.
“We’ll be playing against some competitive teams in Super 4 and for that we need to be in perfect shape.”

1,Australia pick Tim David for T20 World Cup,David’s stunning elevation comes at the expense of leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson.,"SYDNEY: Singapore-born batting powerhouse Tim David was on Thursday called up by Australia for this year’s Twenty20 World Cup on home soil, the only change to the squad that won the tournament last year. 
David’s stunning elevation comes at the expense of leg-spinner Mitchell Swepson, with the 26-year-old earning his chance after a series of headline-grabbing individual performances across domestic cricket. 
“Tim continues to establish himself with some quality performances in leagues around the world, earning a place in the squad,” said chairman of selectors George Bailey of the giant Western Australia-raised middle-order hitter. 
“He is a highly gifted, natural ball striker who will add extra batting depth to the group which has had a lot of success in T20 cricket. “We expect him to play a similar role to that he has been playing in the past few years.” 
Right-hander David play­ed 14 T20s for Singapore but is eligible to switch allegiance because he has Australian parents. 
He burst into the spotlight in the Pakistan Super League last season and has become hot property as a finishing batsman in global leagues including the Indian Premier League and Australia’s Big Bash League. 
Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting is a big fan. 
“He’s the sort of player that could actually win you a Wo­rld Cup,” Ponting said recently of David, who was signed by the Mumbai Indi­ans at the 2022 IPL auction. 
“I know there are some other great world-quality players in the middle order for Australia, but probably none of them boasts the resume as good as Tim’s over the last two years.” 
While Swepson was key at the last World Cup on the spinn­ing wickets in the Uni­ted Arab Emirates, helping Australia to their maiden title in an eight-wicket win over New Zealand in the final, David will be of more use in Australian batting conditions. 
“We still really like Swepo’s skill set but it’s a different strategy,” explained skipper Aaron Finch on why he was axed. “The UAE World Cup last year was on the back of the IPL being played there and it was end-of-season wickets, tired wickets, we were expecting that spin would play a big part. Here we are very happy with the three spinners we have in the squad — Zamps, Agar and Maxi cover us really well.” 
Test captain Pat Cummins returns to the 15-man squad after being rested for the current ODI series against Zimbabwe and next week’s against New Zealand, while Adam Zampa is back in the frame following the birth of his son. 
The World Cup squad will travel to India for three T20 Internationals in September before returning home to play the West Indies and England leading into the World Cup. 
Key batsman David War­ner will miss the Indian tour as part of a “managed period of preparation”, Cricket Aust­ralia said, while Cameron Green will join the squad for the Indian T20 Series. 
The World Cup, which will be played across seven Australian venues, starts on October 16 with Australia beginning against New Zealand in Sydney on October 22. 
Squad: Aaron Finch (captain), David Warner, Mitchell Marsh, Steven Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Matthew Wade, Tim David, Josh Inglis, Ashton Agar, Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood, Kane Richardson.

2,Battling Serena powers into US Open third round,NEW YORK: Serena Willi­ams thrilled a raucous New York crowd after rolling back the years to defeat world number ...,"NEW YORK: Serena Willi­ams thrilled a raucous New York crowd after rolling back the years to defeat world number two Anett Kontaveit in the second round of the US Open on Wednesday, as the exodus of top seeds continued on the third day of the year-end major. 
Serena, 40, produced a sparkling performance to clinch a 7-6(7-4), 2-6, 6-2 victory over Kontaveit, ensuring her farewell tour continued into the third round after signalling her intention to retire in early August. 
She set up a third-round showdown with unseeded Australian Ajla Tomljanovic, who defeated Russian Evgeniya Rodina 1-6, 6-2, 7-5 in their night match. 
Serena, who won the first of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles as a 17-year-old at the US Open in 1999, said she was now playing with no pressure with the finish line of her remarkable career in sight. 
“I’m a pretty good player,” said Serena with a sly grin when asked how she beat her second-seeded opponent. “This is what I do best — I love a challenge, I love rising to a challenge... I have absolutely nothing to prove. I have absolutely nothing to lose.” 
Estonian Kontaveit bec­a­me the highest seeded player in the women’s draw to exit Flushing Meadows and joined Maria Sakkari out of the tournament after the Greek third seed fell 3-6, 7-5, 7-5 to unseeded Wang Xiyu of China. 
Russia’s Liudmila Sams­onova ousted last year’s finalist Leylah Fernandez 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), while 2019 champion Bianca Andreescu cruised into the third round with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Beatriz Haddad Maia. 
Samsonova will face Alek­s­andra Krunic in the next round after she beat 2021 French Open champion Bar­bora Krejcikova 2-6, 6-4, 6-2. 
Elsewhere, Tunisia’s bea­ten Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur sailed into the last 32 with a 7-5, 6-2 win over Elizabeth Mandlik of the United States. 
American 12th seed Coco Gauff, meanwhile, advanced to the third round with a 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) win over unseeded Romanian Elena Gabriela Ruse. 
That win sets up an all-American showdown betw­een Gauff and 20th seed Madison Keys, who needed three sets to edge past Italy’s Camila Giorgi, winning 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (10-6). 
In the men’s draw, world number 53 Jack Draper stunned sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime, last year’s semi-finalist, winning 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time. 
The 20-year-old Draper will take on Russian Karen Khachanov, who beat Thiago Monteiro of Brazil 6-3, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4. 
Reigning champion Daniil Medvedev took another step towards a successful title defence as he marched into the third round after cruising 6-2, 7-5, 6-3 past France Arthur Rinderknech. 
Medvedev will take on Wu Yibing, who became the first Chinese man to reach the third round at Flushing Meadows after beating fellow qualifier  Nuno Borges of Portugal 6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-4, 6-4. 
Former world number one Andy Murray, who won his maiden major crown in New York a decade ago, reached the third round of a Grand Slam for only the second time in five years after beating American wildcard Emilio Nava 5-7, 6-3, 6-1, 6-0. 
Murray will face world number 14 Matteo Berrettini in the next round. The Italian defeated France’s Hugo Grenier 2-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (9-7). 
Australian Nick Kyrgios beat Benjamin Bonzi 7-6 (7-3), 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 to book his spot in the third round where he will play American J.J. Wolf. 
Fifth seed Casper Ruud also advanced after a comeback 6-7 (4-7), 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win over Tim van Rijthoven and he will face American Tommy Paul while Australian 18th seed Alex de Minaur beat Chilean Cristian Garin 6-3, 6-0, 4-6, 6-2.

3,Sri Lanka edge sloppy BD to reach Asia Cup Super 4,DUBAI: Powerful knocks by Kusal Mendis and skipper Dasun Shanaka helped Sri Lanka pull off a thrilling two-wicket ...,"DUBAI: Powerful knocks by Kusal Mendis and skipper Dasun Shanaka helped Sri Lanka pull off a thrilling two-wicket win over Bangladesh to make the Asia Cup Super Four stage here at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.
Chasing 184 in a winner-takes-all game, Sri Lanka rode on a key 54-run stand between Mendis (60) and Shanaka (45) before the tail helped achieve their target with four balls to spare in Dubai.
Mendis fell after his 37-ball knock and Shanaka was out in the 18th over.
But Chamika Karunaratne, with a 10-ball 16, and Asitha Fernando, unbeaten on 10, held their nerve to knock Bangladesh out of the tournament, which acts as a tune-up to the T20 World Cup in October-November in Australia.
Needing eight of the final over, Fernando hit a four and then took two runs off a no ball to trigger celebrations in the Sri Lankan camp.
Bangladesh fast bowler Ebadot Hossain claimed three wickets but gave away 51 runs in his four overs.
Ebadot broke through in his first over to send back Pathum Nissanka for 20 and three balls later took the wicket of Charith Asalanka for one.
Mendis, who was dropped on two by wicket-keeper Mushfiqur Rahim, survived a reprieve on 29 when he was given caught behind but the delivery from off-spinner Mahedi Hasan turned out to be a no ball.
Eabadot dismissed Danushka Gunathilaka as Sri Lanka slipped to 67-3 and soon 77-4 with the departure of the big-hitting Bhanuka Rajapaksa.
Mendis was then kept company by Shanaka as the two put the chase back on track and soon took the attack to the opposition bowlers.
Shanaka hammered Ebadot in a 22-run 13th over while Mendis reached his fifty in 31 balls.
Bangladesh spearhead Mustafizur Rahman sent the Tigers fans wild with the wicket of Mendis, who hit four fours and three sixes in his knock.
Earlier, put in to bat first, Bangladesh posted 183-7 after a 57-run fifth-wicket partnership between Afif Hossain (39) and Mahmudullah Riyad (27).
Mosaddek Hossain chipped in with a useful 24 not out off nine balls to finish the innings with a flourish.
Sri Lanka took regular wickets, with Wanindu Hasaranga and Karunaratne claiming two each to help the island nation move into the next stage alongside Afghanistan from Group B.
The winners of the Group A game between Pakistan and Hong Kong on Friday will secure a Super Four spot alongside India.
Sri Lanka will face Afghanistan in the opening Super Four clash in Sharjah on Saturday.

4,PCB chief executive expects Shaheen to be fit for T20 World Cup,Shaheen injured his knee during Pakistan’s tour of Sri Lanka in July and was ruled out of the ongoing Asia Cup T20.,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi is expected to be available for the national side’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup opener against arch-rivals India on Oct 23.
Shaheen injured his knee during Pakistan’s tour of Sri Lanka in July and was ruled out of the ongoing Asia Cup T20 despite being named in the preliminary squad.
The left-armer travelled to the Netherlands with the team for the three-match One-day International series against the hosts and to the United Arab Emirates for the Asia Cup.
Although the Pakistan Cricket Board had claimed before the Netherlands series that Shaheen would continue his rehabilitation while accompanying the national squad, he was sent to London for what the board’s chief medical officer Najeebullah Soomro termed as “uninterrupted, dedicated knee specialist care”.
The step raised questions if the PCB realised the seriousness of the injury in its early stages. The belief at the board’s higher offices is that Shaheen will be available by the start of the T20 showpiece in Australia. 
“The PCB medical team has been receiving daily reports over the knee injury status of Shaheen and we expect the bowler will be there with the national team to play against India on October 23 in the World Cup match,” PCB’s chief executive officer Faisal Hasnain told Dawn on Thursday. 
“From Sri Lanka to London, the PCB has been following the advice of the medical team and if they advise Shaheen to have treatment in the US then the PCB will follow that too.”
Faisal said the decision to keep Shaheen with the team for the Netherlands tour and the Asia Cup was taken to have the PCB’s medical experts at the bowler’s disposal in person. 
“We are receiving good reports from London on Shaheen’s recovery and the decision to keep the bowler with the national team was taken because our best medical experts were travelling with the team so he (Shaheen) could get every possible help on time,” said the PCB CEO. “Shaheen is our national asset and one of the top world class bowlers.”
Pakistan is scheduled to host the 2023 Asia Cup and the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy but there are questions over the preparedness of the national stadia, which have not hosted international tournaments since the 2008 Asia Cup.
Faisal, who joined the PCB in December last year, admitted that the venues were far from ready to accommodate big international events. The 62-year-old said the PCB had to align their stadia according to the standards set by the International Cricket Council (ICC). 
“We have to sign different agreements with the ICC to meet its requirements and it will take a couple of months,” Faisal said. 
“Then the ICC consultants will come to Pakistan to visit the stadiums to point out what they need more,” he added, admitting the time was running short.
Apart from upgrading the stadiums, the PCB has also revealed its plans to build hotels near the stadiums to accommodate the visiting teams. The board’s chairman Ramiz Raja has mentioned numerous times that the step needs to be taken to control the amount of problems citizens have to face due to heavy security.
Faisal said a couple of locations have been spotted in Lahore for building the required infrastructure and that data was being gathered regarding the issue.
Faisal revealed that another extension will be given to the ad-hoc bodies of the six provincial cricket associations on Sept. 4 with the club scrutiny project still incomplete.
The previous extension was granted six months ago with the expectation that a private firm — hired for club scrutiny — will help the PCB get closer to the district and provincial level elections, which haven’t took place since the implementation of a revamped PCB constitution in 2019.
The revamp wasn’t limited to the board’s administrative structure. It also saw the domestic cricket system switch from the departmental cricket model to the representation of just the six associations side in it.
The step meant the role of departments — which used to employ hundreds of cricketers — ended. Last year, the then ruling government implemented the step across all sports. Recently, however, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif announced the departmental system will be restored. 
Faisal said the PCB had not received any such notifications from the government and will continue to stick with the current domestic structure.
The former ICC official also defended the PCB’s decision to take the full ownership rights of the inaugural Pakistan Junior League — slated for October — after its team ownership rights went unsold despite initial plans to conduct the PJL as a franchise-based tournament.
Faisal believed the PJL was a “great” initiative and said the PCB would hold it “at a world-class level”.
“We should feel proud that the PCB has introduced the league at the junior level and all the cricket boards appreciated the idea and allowed their players to participate in it,” he said.
Faisal said 80 per cent of the PCB funding was being spent on cricket and the remaining on administration adding that the number of the PCB staff was high because the PCB was managing the affairs of all the stadiums, a practice alien to the developed world of cricket.
The official said he had almost 40 years experience of working in various sectors and wished to deliver all his experience for the betterment of Pakistan cricket.
He also hinted that the PCB is planning to add former one-day cricketers to its pension scheme. 
“Currently the scheme is limited to Test cricketers but the point is being considered to expand it to the ODI cricketers too,” said Faisal.

Coach Julian Nagelsmann made seven changes to the team that drew against Borussia Moench­engla­dbach at the weekend with an eye on their Champions League game at Inter Milan next week. 
His team needed time to settle in and new signing Ryan Gravenberch slotted in for a deserved lead in the 35th minute despite a gutsy performance by the hosts. 
French teenager Mathys Tel, who also arrived this season, confirmed his status as one of the most exciting prospects in European football when he rifled in a fine solo effort on the stroke of halftime. 
Sadio Mane, another new signing, made it 3-0 in the 53rd following a quick break to put the game to bed. 
Tel should have scored again when he was sent through with only the Viktoria keeper to beat but Ben Voll stood his ground to deny the 17-year-old. 
Substitute Jamal Musiala did better four minutes later, slotting in from close range before fellow substitute Leon Goretzka, on his comeback from injury, completed the rout. 
“You want to see these players stand out,” said Nagelsmann, lauding the star quality in his squad. “I’m not a fan of the first round of the cup, because as favourite you’ve got everything to lose.”  
Bayern have twice been eliminated in the early rounds from the German Cup over the past two seasons. 
In the 2020-21 campaign the Bavarians lost on penalties to second-division Hols­tein Kiel in the second round of the Cup, while in the 2021-22 season the 20-time winners were ousted 5-0 at the hands of Borussia Moenchen­gl­adbach.

RAWALPINDI: A blistering knock by Sharoon Siraj took Southern Punjab to victory over Balochistan while skipper Khalid Usman helped Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa beat Northern in the Kingdom Valley National T20 Cup matches here at the Pindi Cricket Stadium on Thursday.
Southern Punjab recorded their first win of the event beating Balochistan by 21 runs. With one win each now, Balochistan and Southern Punjab stand at third and fourth positions, respectively.
Southern Punjab looked down and out for the most part of their innings following their captain’s decision to bat as they slumped to 80-6 in 14 overs before a belligerent partnership between player-of-the-match Sharoon and Mohammad Ilyas turned the game on its head, adding 76 off the last six overs.
Sharoon smashed 57 not out off 49 in which he struck six fours and two sixes. But it was Ilyas’s 17-ball 41 featuring four sixes and two fours that lifted Southern Punjab to 156 for six off the stipulated overs.
Yasir Shah finished with 3-17 as the Pakistan leg-spinner dismissed Sohaib Maqsood, Moinuddin and Mohammad Imran.
Balochistan’s run chase was off to a flying start with Haseebullah (21 off 22) and Asad Shafiq (43 off 35) adding 57 in 8.2 overs. But once Salman Ali Agha, the Southern Punjab captain, accounted for Haseebullah in the ninth over, the match started to slip from Balochistan’s grasp. Left-arm wrist spinner Faisal Akram sent Asad back to the pavilion in the next over.
Salman then accounted for Abdul Wahid Bangalzai and Shan Masood in the 13th over to reduce Balochistan to 82-4. With 30 off 25, Hussain Talat showed some resistance down the order but pacer Sameen Gul ensured Balochistan never got back in the game with his dismissals of hard-hitting Amad Butt and Hussain.
In the day’s second encounter, opener Hasan Nawaz (38 off 25) looked on course to hand Northern their first win as they looked to chase 160 but Khalid’s off-spin put a dent in their hopes as he accounted for Nasir Nawaz and Hasan in the fifth and ninth overs to reduce the opposition to 53-3. Khalid finished with terrific figures of 2-16 in four overs.
Rohail Nazir (24 off 29) and Ali Imran (31 off 27) ignited hopes with a 48-run stand off 41 balls but the partnership ended in the 15th over with Rohail’s dismissal and five balls later Ali followed him to the pavilion.
Aamir Jamal’s 29 not out off 15 lifted Northern’s scoring rate towards the backend of the innings and with 15 required off the last six, he brought his side closer to the win but Mohammad Imran defended the target.
Earlier, Sahibzada Farhan was the star of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s innings with a 45-ball 53 (two fours, three sixes) and was duly supported by fellow opener Mohammad Haris (33 off 27). They cracked 83 runs in the first 10 overs that set the tone for the last 10. Mohammad Sarwar Afridi, in the middle order, made 24 off 20 while Khalid contributed 19 off 14 as KP posted a fighting 159-8.
Fast bowlers Usman Khan Shinwari and Salman Irshad took 3-26 and 3-38, respectively.
Summarised scores:
SOUTHERN PUNJAB 156-6 in 20 overs (Sharoon Siraj 57 not out, Mohammad Ilyas 41 not out; Yasir Shah 3-17, Akif Javed 2-53); BALOCHISTAN 135-8 in 20 overs (Asad Shafiq 43, Hussain Talat 30, Haseebullah 21; Salman Ali Agha 3-15, Sameen Gul 2-26).

MILAN: AS Roma stayed top of Serie A on Wednesday after Napoli were held to a 1-1 draw by Lecce, while underwhelming Juventus beat Spezia 2-0. 
Napoli would have gone first on goal difference with a win over their promoted opponents at the Stadio Maradona but Lorenzo Colombo’s rocket in the 31st minute, soon after the hosts went ahead through Elif Elmas ensured Lecce escaped Naples with a point. 
Luciano Spalletti’s side sit third after four games, two points behind Roma and one away from second-placed Inter Milan, while Lecce are 15th after earning their second point of the campaign. 
“This Lecce team sweats blood... and fights for its people. We’ll be rewarded if we go out onto the pitch every time with this spirit,” said Colombo to DAZN. 
Juventus are level on points with Napoli in fourth thanks to a superb free kick by Dusan Vlahovic and a brilliant late goal by new signing Arkadiusz Milik just a few minutes after replacing Vlahovic. 
The three points maintain Juve’s unbeaten record but won’t hide another disappointing performance from Massimiliano Allegri’s injury-dogged side. 
“It is always nice to score, I am happy for the first goal. It means a lot to me,” Milik told Sky Sport Italia. “We suffered in the second half. Dusan is super strong and there are no doubts about it, I am happy I have scored a goal and I am focusing on myself. In the end it is the coach who picks who plays. I think we can play together.” 
Earlier, Manolo Gabbiadini saved a point for Sampdoria in a 1-1 home draw with Lazio, netting his team’s first goal of the season in stoppage time and lifting them out of the Serie A drop zone. 
Sampdoria are 17th with just two points from their first four games after Gabbiadini expertly lashed home his 92nd-minute leveller which denied Lazio, who lead from the 21st minute through Ciro Immobile, the chance to move level with Roma. 
Instead Maurizio Sarri’s side sit sixth and trail local rivals Roma by two points. 
Udinese are three points from the summit in ninth after inflicting a first defeat of the season on Fiorentina thanks to Beto’s 17th-minute strike. 
Empoli and Verona played out a 1-1 draw in the other early kick-off.

11,"Neymar, Mbappe score as PSG stay top",PARIS: Goals by Neymar and Kylian Mbappe helped Paris St Germain stay top of the Ligue 1 standings with a 3-0 ...,"PARIS: Goals by Neymar and Kylian Mbappe helped Paris St Germain stay top of the Ligue 1 standings with a 3-0 victory at Toulouse on Wednesday. 
Christophe Galtier’s reigning champions were never seriously threatened by their newly-promoted opponents and Neymar and Mbappe scored either side of the interval as the French champions moved on to 13 points from five games, ahead of Olympique de Marseille and RC Lens on goal difference. 
The fearsome front three of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Mbappe have now scored 18 times between them already this term. 
“MMN? We can only be satisfied with their performances,” said PSG coach Galtier. 
Toulouse frustrated PSG early in the game, with goalkeeper Maxime Dupe making two smart stops from Mbappe and tipping a Messi shot wide. 
But the away side did take the lead in the 37th minute, as Neymar raced onto Messi’s through ball and slotted into the bottom corner. 
Mbappe doubled the tally five minutes into the second half as he tapped in from Messi’s cut-back inside the box for his fifth league goal. 
More superb goalkeeping by Dupe meant Toulouse were still in the game, but Juan Bernat’s stoppage-time goal from close range ended the hosts’ hopes of a comeback. 
Third-placed Marseille beat Clermont 1-0 at home courtesy of a Pape Gueye goal while Lens played their usual attractive football to destroy visiting Lorient 5-2, Florian Sotoca scoring twice while Wesley Said, Salis Abdul Samed and Lois Openda also found the net. 
Olympique Lyonnais, who have a game in hand, are fourth on 10 points after beating promoted AJ Auxerre 2-1 at home as Karl Toko Ekambi assisted Tete’s opener before volleying in his side’s second goal. 
Nice finally claimed their first victory of the campaign as Nicolas Pepe scored a match-winning penalty on his second appearance since joining on loan from Arsenal. 
Earlier, Monaco suffered their second defeat when they lost 4-2 at home to Troyes, a result that left them 16th in the standings on five points. 
Monaco, who have not won in three home games at the Louis II stadium this season, were down to 10 men after 44 minutes when Guillermo Maripan picked up a second yellow card. 
Elsewhere, 10-man Reims claimed a 4-2 victory at Angers as on-loan Arsenal forward Folarin Balogun scored his fourth goal of the season from the penalty spot.

12,"Haaland on fire for City, Arsenal stay perfect",LONDON: Arsenal extended their perfect start to the Premier League season with a 2-1 win against Aston Villa but...,"LONDON: Arsenal extended their perfect start to the Premier League season with a 2-1 win against Aston Villa but Manchester City’s new signing Erling Haaland stole the limelight with his second hat-trick in 6-0 romp over Nottingham Forest on Wednesday. 
City and Arsenal have set the early pace, but Liverpool are gathering momentum after snatching a last-gasp 2-1 victory against Newcastle United. Newcastle’s record signing Alexander Isak scored on his debut to put his side ahead at Anfield but Liverpool victory deep in stoppage time through Fabio Carvalho. 
Tottenham Hotspur remained unbeaten but were held to a 1-1 draw at West Ham United. 
Haaland has made a blistering start since his 50 million ($58 million) move from Borussia Dortmund in the close-season and the Norway striker’s latest goal spree set a Premier League record. 
After scoring three times in the second half in a win over Crystal Palace at the weekend, Haaland struck three times in the opening 38 minutes and his tally of nine goals after his first five appearances is a new high in the Premier League era, beating the previous mark of eight set by City great Sergio Aguero and Micky Quinn. 
Inspired by Haaland’s first-half treble, Pep Guardiola’s unbeaten side ran riot at the Etihad Stadium, reaching 19 goals from just five games. 
“It was about keeping doing what we did in the second half against Palace, play, play, play — it was nice. It’s been good so far, I’m not complaining,” Haaland said. Haaland put City ahead in the 12th minute after a pass by Phil Foden and Foden provided the assist for Haaland’s second. He completed his treble with a powerful header from virtually on the goal-line. 
Argentine Julian Alvarez, another new signing for the champions, scored twice after the break as City again displayed their formidable firepower. 
City have 13 points from their five games and are two points behind Arsenal after Mikel Arteta’s side edged Villa at The Emirates — Brazilian strike duo Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli both on target for the Gunners. 
Jesus opened the scoring in the 31st minute and Martinelli grabbed the 77th-minute winner from Bukayo Saka’s cross, three minutes after struggling Villa had equalised when substitute Douglas Luiz scored directly from a corner. 
“We are really happy because we are winning football matches the way we deserve,” Arteta said. “We need to improve and you could see that in the second half, but the way we played in the first half is really pleasing as a coach.” 
Villa boss Steven Gerrard, jeered off after losing at home to West Ham on Sunday, will come under renewed pressure following his side’s fourth defeat in five games this season. 
Asked if he worried about his future, Gerrard said: “Of course I do. I am really honest and critical of myself.” 
Liverpool have made a stuttering start and when Isak, signed for a reported 59 million pounds from Real Sociedad, latched on to Sean Longstaff’s pass to put Newcastle ahead in the 38th minute it looked like being another night of frustration. 
But, building on the momentum from Saturday’s 9-0 rout of Bournemouth — which equalled the record for the Premier League’s biggest win — Liverpool equalised when Roberto Firmino slotted in Mohamed Salah’s 61st-minute pass. 
Newcastle defended desperately for a point but were left crestfallen when Carvalho — a day after his 20th birthday — thumped home the winner in the eighth minute of stoppage time to move Liverpool up to fifth in the table on eight points, with Newcastle 11th on six. 
“The perfect moment to win because it was a difficult game. What a wonderful goal from the birthday kid. It’s massive. We will remember it for years,” Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said. 
Third-placed Tottenham, who could have joined City on 13 points, led at West Ham thanks to an own goal by Thilo Kehrer. But Tomas Soucek earned West Ham a deserved point with a 55th-minute leveller. 
Bournemouth, who sacked manager Scott Parker this week in after their humiliation at Liverpool, regrouped with a 0-0 draw at home to Wolves at Dean Court.
