1,Rs300 million announced for reconstruction work in Mansehra,MANSEHRA: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has announced Rs300 million funds for the reconstruction of irrigation...,"MANSEHRA: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has announced Rs300 million funds for the reconstruction of irrigation channels and infrastructure washed away by flash floods in Kaghan and Manor valleys here.
“The [Rs300 million] funds for reconstruction will be released on an emergency basis,” irrigation minister Arshad Ayub Khan told flood survivors in Mahandri area of Kaghan valley on Thursday.
The minister said he had come to the area to assess damage by flooding to the infrastructure, including roads, bridges and irrigation channels, and their reconstruction would begin soon.
Accompanied by special assistant to the chief minister on population Ahmad Hussain Shah, Mr Arshad said the government stood with flood survivors in the critical time of their life and would ensure their early rehabilitation.
He said the government had begun giving away compensation cheques to the families, who lost members to the monsoon disaster in the province, and would also compensate the people for damaged and destroyed houses.
CM special assistant Ahmad Hussain said the calamity had affected Mahandri, Balakot, Jarad and Manoor areas the most in the district.
He said residents of dozens of villages and adjoining towns continued to be cut off from the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road due to the destruction of roads, bridges and other infrastructure by floods.
“The government is working on an emergency basis to ensure the supply of food and other essential goods to the affected families,” he said.
KKH REBUILDING: The Frontier Works Organisation has begun rebuilding the flood-hit Karakoram Highway in Zaid Kawar area of Upper Kohistan district.
Part of the highway was washed away by floodwaters on August 27 suspending traffic between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Motorist Mohammad Jabran told reporters that the people travelling between KP and GB used the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road after the KKH’s destruction in Zaid Kawar area but those going to Upper Kohistan suffered adversely.
Mohammad Khaqan of Dasu, the district headquarters of Upper Kohistan, said KP-GB commuters had to change two vehicles to reach their respective destinations.
“We use a passenger coach and bus to reach the destroyed portion of the KKH before crossing it on foot and taking another vehicle to leave for our places,” he said.
A FWO official said the August 27 flash floods had destroyed a 70 meters long portion of the KKH, so another alternative route was being created for KP-GB traffic.
He said the work would take almost a week for completion as the mountain blasting and drilling were very difficult and risky in the area.

2,Flood renders bedridden senior Pashto poet homeless,"PESHAWAR: Like thousands of other people, the recent flood added to the miseries of bedridden senior Pashto poet...","PESHAWAR: Like thousands of other people, the recent flood added to the miseries of bedridden senior Pashto poet Akmal Lewanai as his house was swept away by the floodwater.
Akmal Lewanai, 76, once stockbroker of rich laughter through his humorous and satirical couplets, now looks up to relief workers and his diehard fans to come to his rescue in the twilight of his age. “Old age and ailing health has forced me to ask for helping hand of my fans and government aid workers in these trying times,” he said in choking voice.
Author of over dozen of books, he has served Pashto for over five decades through his unique poetic expression and mobile bookselling skills where he used to motivate audience to develop taste for reading.
The octogenarian poet told this scribe by telephone that despite his efforts, no relief aid was extended to his family. Being bedridden, he could not move himself to approach to relief workers in the area, he added.
About four years ago, the reputed poet, once a mobile bookseller, was bedridden following a major spinal cord surgery in Islamabad, which devoured much of his personal kitty. The recent flash floods washed away his two-room mud house, leaving no space where he could take rest.
“I need urgent hospitalisation as living in the debris of collapsed home has become extremely difficult for me. I have also gone out of cash money. Therefore, my health condition is fast deteriorating. I appeal to the philanthropists and aid workers to extend medical and financial help in the time of destitute,” he said in sobbing voice.
Mr Lewanai said that he had a rare collection of Pashto and Urdu books and pamphlets that his family could save from being swept away in the roaring floodwater in a corner of the house. He said that the books could be purchased for public libraries that would earn some money in return.
“The collection is no longer in my personal use and if the government could manage to purchase it, a reasonable price would in return help in a way. My only son is a tenant with no resources to afford my medical treatment and look after. The relief volunteers should turn their attention towards my helpless position,” he said.

However, the pain of 14-year-old Hazrat Bilal, a resident of the ill-fated village, knows no limits as flood has not only swept away his house and books but also caused the death of his father.
His father worked in Karachi to earn livelihood for his family. He was also in Karachi when the flood hit his village Chail Depo in Madyan valley. “When my father learnt that the house and the agricultural lands were washed away, he got on a bus to come here. But then we received a call from an unknown person that he died of cardiac arrest,” Bilal narrated his ordeal.
Bilal was waiting for the arrival his father’s dead body while his uncles were busy in making preparations for his burial. “I was asleep when my elder brother awakened me and told me to leave the house as the flood had hit our area,” he told this scribe.

Flood washed away entire Chail Depo locality on Aug 25

He said that it was raining heavily outside and he was told to rush to upper areas to save his life. “It was a terrible scene when the flood entered our house and wiped out it completely within no time. It was the most frightening moment of my life when the terrible flood engulfed our village,” he added.
Bilal said that he and his family members were watching their house being washed away but they could not do anything. He said that they could not even sit as there was heavy rain the whole day. He said that they had to stay awake all the time under the open sky.
He said that the flood also washed away all their agricultural lands and livestock. The devastating floods washed away the entire Chail Depo village and the residents had to live either with their relatives or under the open sky.
Shah Wazir Khan, an elderly man, who was sitting in his washed away fields, said it was about 4:30am when a neighbour knocked his door and told him to evacuate the house immediately. “When we came out, we saw that the raging floodwater was moving towards our village,” he added.
He said that he and his family members rushed out of their house and within a few minutes his house was no more. “The flood wiped out our eight-room house, a shop, and other houses in the village. The devastating flood deprived me of everything I had. I don’t know what to do for the livelihood as the entire agricultural land has also been washed away by the flood,” he said gloomily.
Shah Wazir said that he was staying with his relatives while his sons stayed with some other villagers. He appealed to the government to help him as he and his family were left at the mercy of God.
Hazrat Faqir, another resident of the village, said that he and his brothers had spent the earnings of their lives to construct their houses but the flood deprived them of their houses in a wink. “I cannot estimate our losses as the flood washed away 14 houses of our family and a vast tract of agricultural land,” he said, adding that apart from the agricultural land, the flood washed away their walnut trees and a persimmons orchard.

9,Juvenile gets bail after two years imprisonment without trial,He alleges police violated juvenile justice law,"PESHAWAR: A local court has granted bail to a juvenile person after over two years of imprisonment without trialin an alleged murder case.
Additional district and sessions judge Nasir Khan ruled that the accused, who filed the petition, was entitled to the concession of bail, so he should be freed on the production of two surety bonds of Rs100,000 each.
The petitioner was 14 at the time of his arrest in Feb 2020. He remained imprisoned since then as the challan (charge sheet) was submitted to the court after a delay of two years and four months.
Advocate Shabbir Hussain Gigyani appeared for him and contended that the police and the prosecution had submitted challan after an abnormal delay of over two years, which was a grave violation of Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as well as Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018.

He alleges police violated juvenile justice law

He argued that under the law the challan had to be submitted within 14 days of the occurrence, whereas the trial should be concluded within six months.
The lawyer said the FIR of the so-called occurrence was registered under Section 17(4) of the Offence against Property (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979, at Pahari Pura police station on Feb 12, 2020.
He said Habibur Rehman had died a natural death before his son formally telling the police that he suspected murder and that his father’s cash and mobile phone were missing.
The counsel said the police had later on exhumed the body and conducted its autopsy. He, however, said even the postmortem report it was not proved that the deceased had died of unnatural death as there were no marks of violence on his body.
He argued that the first blunder committed by the police was that the said provision of law mentioned in the FIR was applicable to an adult accused, whereas the petitioner was 14 years of age at that time.
The lawyer said a school certificate of the petitioner acquired by the investigation officer proved that he was only 14 at the time of the alleged crime. He said the challan in the instant case was submitted to the trial court on June 17, 2022, which was in violation of the law.
He pointed out that the petitioner, being a destitute person, had no resources to hire a counsel due to which he had been appearing for him pro bono.
Mr Gigyani referred to different judgments of the Supreme Court, including a judgement authored by Justice Qazi Faez Isa, wherein the issue of the delay in submission of challan was discussed and different directions were issued to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa police for avoiding that practice.
He said despite the apex court’s clear directions, the local police violated the law with the case in question confirming it.

Talking to mediapersons in separate camps arranged here to collect donations for flood-hit people, they said that floods had not only destroyed houses, but also washed away grain stored by the people for meeting their basic food needs besides damaging standing crops. 
“As the people have lost their grain in floods they need the government assistance to get grain and meet the food requirements of their families,” said ANP leader Mukhtiar Khan. 
Answering a question, he said that availability of food should be ensured to the people in collaboration with the national and international partners by improving the supply chain. 
Former provincial minister and JUI-F leader Maulana Fazal Ali said that floods had destroyed standing crops and as such the issue of food security should be handled with great care. 
“Food insecurity is not a short-term issue, but it has become a long-term problem that needs a comprehensive plan to be tackled,” he said. The leaders of the two parties said that they would continue collecting donations to help the flood-affected people. 
OPERATION: An operation has been started to remove encroachments from irrigation channels and rainwater courses in Swabi tehsil areas under the supervision of assistant commissioner Mohammad Usman Ashraf. 
Heavy machinery is being used by the irrigation officials to complete the task. 
The officials said that during the operation all the encroachments would be demolished and removed so that there was no obstruction in the drains and rainwater courses to avoid flooding in future.

12,Deployment of pharmacists proposed at medical camps for flood survivors,PSHSP says medicines should be stored in scientific way,"PESHAWAR: Pakistan Society of Health System Pharmacists (PSHSP) has called for deployment of pharmacists at medical camps in flood-hit area to avoid health issues caused by duplication of antibiotics and other medicines.
A member of the society said that pregnant women, patients with co-morbidities, infants and people with cardiac ailments, hypertension and diabetes required the services of pharmacists at medical camps.
“The guidelines are meant to handle donations in a scientific way and ensure its correct storage and usage by displaced people to avoid complications and adverse effects,” said the member.
Health department, Provincial Doctors Association, Malgari Doctaran, Insaf Doctors Forum, Pakistan Islamic Medical Association and NGOs continue to hold emergency camps for the flood victims with free medicines but pharmacists say that use of medicines under proper protocol is significant to achieve better results.

PSHSP says medicines should be stored in scientific way

Dr Mohammad Amir of PSHSP said that in natural calamities, providing healthcare services became the most critical activities. He said that medical camps played their role to help the people but in such situation, the appropriate use of medication was as vital as other necessities.
He said that the society wanted the medics to consider the handing of medication during relief operation and avoid misuse of drugs, especially anti-diarrhoeal, anti-emetic, anti-allergic and gastro protective, the most common drugs used in emergencies.
The society recommends determination of the shelf life of medicines before accepting the donation and emphasises on proper storage condition of drugs. A list of medications required during the relief is also part of the guidelines.
“Pharmacists should play their role in implementing the guidelines. Few hospitals have already engaged their pharmacists in their medical camp activities,” said Dr Amir.
Saad Salman a research fellow at department of pharmacy at University of Peshawar, said that that it was very necessary to store medicines at room temperature or sometimes at lower temperature of 2-10’C, along with protection from sunlight. “So pharmacists are necessary to ensure the quality of medicines along with prescription of right medicine to the right patient. Currently, we observe that everyone at camps is trying to get medicines by any means without checking,” he said
He said that majority of skin medicines were prepared and remixed according to quantity required by patient in sterile area while antibiotics should be used with caution to ensure that the patient was previously not using other antibiotics.
Saad Salman said that risk of medicine duplication at camps prevailed as teams of multiple specialties were present at the same location. “It is the mentality of our community to visit every doctor if free check-up and drugs are available,” he said.
He said that dextrose and saline drips were administered to patients just to satisfy them mentally as they needed attention. “Expiry of product is also important as the distributors and providers already know that the medicine will be used at camps and no one will check the items,” he added.
Saad Salman said that main health issues at camps were diarrhoea, vomiting and rashes etc. “Some medicine have specific adverse effects for which presence of pharmacist at the camps is equally important as in hospitals and other medical care settings because appropriate dose, drug and frequency is needed by every patient,” he added.
He said that at medical camps infants, children, adults, young, old, pregnant and immunocompromised patients were checked by doctors and giving them appropriate drug was necessary.
“The most important population is the pregnant women and people with co-morbidities. They need extra care in prescribing appropriate drug, which can be best managed by pharmacist. Some people are allergic to specific drug and they require alternative,” said Saad Salman.
