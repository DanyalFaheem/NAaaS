0,Super tax leads to 38pc drop in bank profits,"Govt has imposed a 10pc super tax on profit-before-tax, which has reduced the sector’s overall earnings.","KARACHI: Profits of listed banks went down 38 per cent on a year-on-year basis in the April-June quarter, thanks to the imposition of super tax in the 2022-23 budget.
The drop in quarterly income was 46pc on a sequential basis, according to data released by Topline Securities on Thursday.
The government has imposed a 10pc super tax on profit-before-tax, which has reduced the sector’s overall earnings.
Pre-tax profits of the 19 listed banks went up 37pc and 19pc on an annual and quarterly bases to Rs160 billion in the April-June quarter.
Growth in pre-tax profits of the sector was led by a strong balance sheet growth driving net interest income as well as higher non-interest income.
Total assets of the sector grew 24pc year-on-year whereas total deposits of the sector rose 17pc. The sector-wide ratio of non-performing loans dropped to 6.6pc in April-June versus 7.8pc a year ago with the total coverage ratio of 95pc.
Data showed the Pakistani lender with the highest market capitalisation was Meezan Bank Ltd. Its total value of all shares was more than $1 billion, followed by United Bank Ltd ($713 million), MCB Bank Ltd ($711m) and Habib Bank Ltd ($666m).
Among larger commercial banks, Meezan Bank Ltd also held the highest price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is (P/E) ratio is a benchmark that measures a firm’s current share price relative to its income per share. 
The Islamic lender’s P/E was 5.4 versus the sector-wide average of 3.8. A higher P/E shows either the company’s stock is overvalued or that investors expect high growth rates in the future.

1,Focus shifting to renewables to meet national energy demand,SDPI chief says Pakistan must cultivate renewable sources of energy after assessing the policy trade-offs.,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s entire energy demand can be met by taking advantage of only 0.07 per cent of the country’s solar potential.
Speaking at the First Annual State of Renewable Energy Confer­ence on Thursday, Sustainable De­­velopment Policy Institute (SDPI) Executive Director Dr Abid Q Suleri said the country must cultivate renewable sources of energy after assessing the policy trade-offs.
“Fossil fuels are key drivers of climate change. We’ve witnessed their impact in the form of heatwaves and floods,” he said in his inaugural session at the conference, which was organised by the SDPI’s Network for Clean Energy Transition in collaboration with GIZ, Unilever Pakistan, Energy Update, Stimulus, and Renewables First.
Explaining the country’s renewable energy generation potential, SDPI’s Research Fellow Dr Hina Aslam said Sindh and Balochistan can produce 340 gigawatts of wind-generated electricity, adding that recycling 30 million metric tonnes of municipal solid waste annually should also be exploited to produce energy from waste.
Pakistan experienced a 3.25pc increase in renewable energy in 2021 while net foreign direct investment in the power sector was $911.7 million.
Additions of renewable energy capacity to the power system are slow in Pakistan. About 200 megawatts of solar- and 750MW of wind-based electricity have been commissioned (or added) in 2022. As a result, the total installed capacity of solar and wind energy is currently 600MW and 1,985MW, respectively, according to the Annual State of Renewable Energy Report Pakistan released on Thursday.
In terms of the tariff determination of renewables, Dr Aslam said the current cost of generation from different sources shows renewables were becoming increasingly competitive with conventional fossil fuel–based sources.
The current generation mix includes wind and solar with much higher older tariffs of Rs25.25 per kWh and Rs24.41 per kWh as well as the latest plants whose tariff is as low as Rs16.20 per kWh and Rs19.14 per kWh. The tariff determined by the power sector regulator for wind plants in the last decade has come down from Rs12.77 per kWh to Rs6.39 per kWh.
She said a transition towards a 100pc renewable energy system is not only fully possible but also a low-cost option, which will help decrease the energy system costs while reducing national dependence on imported fossil fuels.
Speaking on the occasion, Alternate Energy Development Board CEO Shah Jahan Mirza said the board is launching a large-solar power project with the capacity of 2,400MW with the government providing three sites to private power companies.
K-Electric Ltd Chief Strategic Officer Naz Khan said her company plans to add 1,200MW from renewable energy in the next seven to eight years. As many as 637MW were generated and 519MW were commissioned on net metering of domestic consumers in June 2022, she added. Incentives should be extended through cost-reflective tariffs and competitive bidding to attract investment to renewable energy, said Ms Khan.

2,Pakistan urged to add value to textile goods,Demand for improved product quality comes at a time when Pakistan is facing a severe shortage of approximately 9m bales.,"LAHORE: The US Cotton Council Intern­ational (CCI) on Thursday urged Pakistan to manufacture and export textile goods to America after enormous value-addition.
The advice came at a meeting held between the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) and the CCI, with the objective of apprising the body about cotton quality, challenges, and possible solutions vis a vis challenges being faced by Pakistani cotton growers.
“Mutual cooperation between the American cotton growers and Pakistan’s textile industry offers a win-win situation for both countries where raw cotton imported from the US is converted into manufactured textile products and exported back to the US after enormous value addition,” said Kathleen Gibilisco, the Head of the Economic Wing of the US Consulate.
She was accompanying the US’s CCI delegation that called on the Aptma office bearers, emphasised the need for growth and sustainability in trade and economic relations between Pakistan and the US. She expressed hope that the current trend of growth in trade and economic ties would continue in the future as well.
The demand for improved product quality comes at a time when Pakistan is facing a severe shortage of approximately nine million bales this year due to various factors, including the devastation of the agriculture fields largely by floods.
It may be mentioned that Pakistan’s cotton demand continues to rise, as it needs 15m bales this year.
The Aptma and CCI representatives resolved to boost bilateral cooperation in the area of cotton and explore investment opportunities in Pakistan.

4,SBP reserves hit two-month high,Reach $8.86bn with the inclusion of $1.16bn from the IMF.,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign exchange reserves reached a two-month high of $8.857 billion on Thursday with the inclusion of $1.16bn from the International Monetary Fund under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
The SBP said it received proceeds of $1.16bn (the equivalent of SDR 894 million) under the EFF on Aug 31, which would be included in SBP’s FX reserve position for the week ending Sept 2.
However, the SBP went on to add that its foreign exchange reserves had further decreased by $113 million during the week ended Aug 26.
The declining foreign exchange reserves remained a serious threat to the external account of the economy during the entire previous fiscal year (FY22), which ended on June 30.
The foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank fell by 61.6 per cent as it lost $12.376bn during the last 12 months. In August 2021, the SBP reserves were $20.073bn, which fell to $7.697bn in August this year.
The huge loss of foreign exchange resulted in extreme destabilisation of the exchange rate and the local currency’s devaluation by 31pc against the US dollar. With fluctuations in the rates, the dollar reached a record high of Rs239.5 on July 28.
With the inclusion of $1.16bn from the IMF, the foreign exchange reserves of the country’s state bank reached $8.857bn on September 1, which was two months high. In July, the reserves were $8.38bn while they were $9.816bn in June.
Since the country recorded a huge current account deficit of $17.4bn in FY22, it needs about $35bn during the fiscal year FY23 for debt servicing and other payments attached to the international liabilities.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported the dollar closed at Rs218.60. The impact of the IMF tranche was not very encouraging during the last three days when the IMF announced reviving the loan programme for Pakistan.
However, the dollar during the last three sessions lost just Rs3.32 from Rs221.92 (Aug 29) to Rs218.60 on Thursday. 
Currency dealers said the market would evaluate the actual value of the local currency when dollars from friendly countries would start landing in the State Bank’s account.

Imports shrink 13.5pc to $5.7bn

For the first time, the country not only achieved the export target but exceeded the psychological barrier of $30bn in FY22. Pakistan’s exports increased 26.6pc to $31.845bn in the just-ended fiscal year, up from $25.160bn a year ago.
The textile sector has already complained about the rising cost of energy and raw materials mainly due to massive rupee depreciation. Moreover, exporters have also complained about refunds that stuck with the Federal Board of Revenue.
Contrary to this, the import bill fell by 13.5pc to $5.7bn in August from $6.59bn in the same month last year. In July, imports dropped by 12.81pc to $4.86bn from $5.57bn over the corresponding month of last year.

8,"Duty-free imports of onions, tomatoes okayed",ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday exempted sales tax and withholding tax on the import of tomatoes and onions ...,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday exempted sales tax and withholding tax on the import of tomatoes and onions for a period of four months, especially from Afghanistan and Iran, to arrest the skyrocketing prices of the vegetables in the domestic market in the aftermath of heavy rains and floods.
Tomatoes and onions are currently cleared at Torkham, Chaman, and Taftan customs border stations for a fee of 17 per cent sales tax, 3pc additional sales tax, and 1pc withholding tax. All these duties and taxes are exempt until Dec 31.
Pakistan is already importing vegetables from Afghanistan and Iran to bridge the shortfall in domestic production and cater to the rising demand. However, the government will have to look for other options to import, including India, because local crop destruction and delay in sowing cannot alone be catered to by imports from these two countries.
There are no restrictions or permit requirements for imports except in India of these products and to meet domestic quality standards.
The exemptions are not country-specific and these products can be imported from any country duty-free, according to two notifications issued by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). The purpose is to ease the shortages amid the destruction caused by the floods.
Tomato and onion prices in Pakistan have shot up after heavy rains led to crop damage and a shortage of these kitchen staples.
The average maximum national price of tomatoes was Rs160 per kg, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics; though it is selling at as high as Rs250 per kg in several parts of the country, as are onions at Rs130, while they are selling at as high as Rs300 per kg.
Recent floods have brought unprecedented crop damage. As a result, the prices of onions and tomatoes have skyrocketed in the local markets. The elimination of all taxes and duties on procuring the two vegetables by import will help reduce their prices.
Earlier, FBR issued five SROs, which exempted from duties and taxes all goods that are needed for flood relief operations as certified by the National Disaster Management Authority or Provincial Disaster Management Authority. Furthermore, the receipt of donations and relief aid has also been exempted.
Official data available to Dawn showed that the total import of onions from Afghanistan at Torkham border station in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stood at 990 vehicles between July and August 2022, while that of tomatoes stood at 4,100 vehicles during the same period.
The average quantity of tomatoes and onions per truck ranges from 20 tonnes to 34 tonnes depending on the size of the vehicles. The average tax is Rs8,200 per tonne of onions and Rs580 per tonne of tomatoes. Onion prices are expected to see the most relief.
In July and August 2022, the quantity of imported tomatoes at Torkham stood at 103,142 tonne while that of fresh onions was 16,176 tonnes.
In Balochistan, the import of onions from Afghanistan at the Chaman border stood at 209.05 tonnes between January and August. It was only in the month of August that the import of tomatoes started from Afghanistan via Chaman border station, which stood at 19 tonnes.
Data shows the import of tomatoes from Iran to Balochistan via different customs stations, including Taftan, stood at 1771 trucks of fresh tomatoes transported to Pakistan between January and August 2022, while 142 trucks of fresh onions, respectively.
In quantity terms, the total quantity of fresh tomatoes imported stood at 39716.852 tonnes between July and August 2022, while that of fresh onions stood at 2731.788 tonnes, respectively.
