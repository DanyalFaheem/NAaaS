0,Trump confronts govt in court battle over seized papers,Trump’s lawyers are asking that an outside party be named to reassess the government’s screening of sensitive documents.,"WEST BEACH: An increasingly high-stakes standoff between Donald Trump and federal investigators lands in court on Thursday, after days of headline-grabbing revelations surrounding highly classified documents seized by the FBI from the former president’s Florida home.
Trump’s lawyers are asking that an outside party — a  “special master” — be named to reassess the government’s screening of sensitive documents to determine if any were  “highly personal information” that should be returned or protected by claims of privilege.
The federal court has already indicated its  “preliminary intent” to agree to the independent review, meaning there is little intrigue with respect to the stated purpose of the hearing. But the request has significantly upped the ante.
Some analysts see the move as an attempt by Team Trump to complicate the probe.
It also prompted a searing disclosure by the Justice Department of the evidence against the Republican former president recovered from the search of his Mar-a-Lago residence in south Florida last month.
Government officials said in a filing on Tuesday they had evidence of efforts to hide classified documents despite a grand jury demand in May that Trump produce records removed from the White House in January 2021.
Some of the files were so sensitive, they noted, that federal agents and Justice Department personnel needed their security clearances elevated to even look at the material.
The filing also stated that FBI agents located classified documents in Trump’s desk drawers with his passports. “The location of the passports is relevant evidence in an investigation of unauthorised retention and mishandling of national defense information,” the department said.
The filing provided the most detailed account yet of a year-and-a-half long effort to recover hundreds of classified files that were improperly taken to Mar-a-Lago when Trump left office. And the claim of obstructing the FBI search piles further legal pressure on the former president, who denies all wrongdoing.
The two sides are expected to wrangle over the scope of the review and whether it will determine if parts of the cache are covered by  “privilege” that can shield some presidential and attorney-client communications from investigation. Prosecutors say Trump  “has no property interest in any presidential records (including classified records) seized from the premises” and that he cannot assert executive privilege against the executive branch itself.
But the real drama could emerge in US District Judge Aileen Cannon’s questioning of the 76-year-old billionaire’s attorneys, when she will have the opportunity to quiz them over whether he declassified some of the documents, as he has claimed.
Trump’s latest legal filing on Wednesday didn’t address the most damaging aspects of the government’s potential obstruction case and did not claim that he declassified the documents while he was in office.
Cannon, a Trump appointee, may also scrutinize the certification that his lawyers delivered to the Justice Department on June 3, falsely stating that all files with classified markings had been returned.

1,Clashes in Basra kill four as crisis flares in Iraq’s south,"""The security situation in Basra is really bad, and could escalate,"" one security official says.","BAGHDAD: Clashes among rival Shia militants in the Iraqi city of Basra have killed at least four people, security officials said on Thursday, as violence from a worsening political crisis hit the south of the country.
The unrest began with two days of intense street fighting in Baghdad earlier in the week, the worst the Iraqi capital has seen for years.
The crisis amounts to a power struggle between the powerful cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and mostly Iran-aligned parties and paramilitary groups.
Both sides have tried to exert their control over formation of a new government since an election in October. The struggle began with political moves in parliament and the judiciary, went to the streets as Sadr withdrew from the political process and staged protests during the summer, and then degenerated into violence at the end of August.
It has left Iraq, which is reeling from years of war, sanctions, civil strife and corruption, without a government for the longest period since the 2003 US invasion which toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.
The violence has centred on Baghdad and the south, areas dominated by Iraq’s Shia majority which has ruled the country since Saddam’s regime was swept away.
“The security situation in Basra is really bad, and could escalate,” one of the security officials said.
Both security officials in Basra, Iraq’s main oil-producing hub, said the deadliest clashes took place overnight in the centre of the city. Two of those killed were members of Sadr’s Peace Brigades militia, they said.
On Thursday morning, gunmen attacked government buildings in Basra where security forces and paramilitary groups with links to Iran are stationed. The officials could not immediately identify the gunmen firing on the government buildings, but said they believed they were Sadr supporters.
The leader of one Iran-backed militia group and one of Sadr’s main rivals, Qais al-Khazali, said in a statement that he was ordering all offices of his group closed and urging supporters not to retaliate if they were attacked.
Armed supporters of Sadr have attacked offices belonging to Iran-aligned groups in recent days, security officials say. In the southern city of Nassiriya, his followers raided a local headquarters for paramilitaries with ties to Iran and seized cars and weapons, according to Sadrist and Iran-aligned security officials in the city.
In Baghdad on Monday and Tuesday, armed supporters of Sadr fought with security forces and Iran-aligned gunmen in clashes that broke out hours after Sadr announced his full withdrawal from political life.
After Sadr’s announcement his followers, who had until then been staging a peaceful sit-in at the parliament, began storming other government buildings and were shot at. His militiamen retaliated and the clashes began.

2,Treatment improves cognition in Down Syndrome patients,"Cognition and smell tests were carried out during the treatment, as were MRI scans.","PARIS: A new hormone treatment improved the cognitive function of six men with Down Syndrome by 10-30 percent, scientists said on Thursday, adding the  “promising” results may raise hopes of improving patients’ quality of life.
However the scientists emphasised the small study did not point towards a cure for the cognitive disorders of people with Down Syndrome and that far more research is needed.
“The experiment is very satisfactory, even if we remain cautious,” said Nelly Pitteloud of Switzerland’s Lausanne University Hospi­tal and co-author of a new study in the journal Science.
Down Syndrome is the most common genetic form of intellectual disability, occurring in around one in 1,000 people, according to the World Health Organisation.
Yet previous research has failed to significantly impr­ove cognition when applied to people with the condition, which is why the latest findings are  “particularly important”, the study said.
Recent discoveries have suggested that how the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is produced in the brain can affect cognitive functioning such as memory, language and learning. GnRH hormones regulate how much testosterone and estrogen is produced and increased levels of it help spur puberty.
“We wondered if this hormone could play any role in establishing the symptoms of people with Down Syndrome,” said Vincent Prevot, study co-author and head of neuroscience research at France’s INSERM institute.
The team first established that five strands of microRNA regulating the production of GnRH were dysfunctional in mice specifically engineered for Down Syndrome research.
They then demonstrated that cognitive deficiencies — as well as loss of smell, a common symptom of Down Syndrome — were linked to dysfunctioning GnRH secretion in the mice.
The team then gave the mice a GnRH medication used to treat low testosterone and delayed puberty in humans, finding that it restored some cognitive function and sense of smell. A pilot study was conducted in Switzerland involving seven men with Down Syndrome aged 20 to 50.
They each received the treatment through their arm every two hours over a period of six months, with the drug delivered in pulses to mimic the hormone’s frequency in people without Down Syndrome.
Cognition and smell tests were carried out during the treatment, as were MRI scans.
Six of the seven men showed improvement in cognition with no significant side effects — however none showed a change in their sense of smell.
“We have seen an improvement of between 10-30 percent in cognitive functions, in particular with visuospatial function, three-dimensional representation, understanding of instructions as well as attention,” Pitteloud said.
The patients were asked to draw a simple 3D bed at several stages throughout the therapy. Many struggled at the beginning but by the end the efforts were noticeably better.
The authors acknowledged some limitations of the study, including its size and that the choice of patients was  “pushed by their parents”.

3,US is underestimating consequences of CO2: study,"LONDON: The US government is drastically underestimating the social cost of carbon dioxide emissions, which is 3.6...","LONDON: The US government is drastically underestimating the social cost of carbon dioxide emissions, which is 3.6 times higher than the estimate currently used to inform many of Washington’s key climate policies, a study suggested on Thursday.
Carbon dioxide is the greenhouse gas chiefly responsible for global warming and therefore negatively affects human wellbeing. US economists call this the  “social cost” and they calculate it in dollars, considering repercussions such as changes in agricultural productivity, damages from sea level rise and worsening human health.
The US currently puts that cost at around $51 per metric tonne a figure which dates back to the Obama administration, adjusted for inflation. 
But in research published on Thursday in the journal Nature, a team of American scientists say the reality of such damages is likely far greater, at $185 per tonne.
That’s important because  “higher estimates of the social cost motivate more ambitious mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions,” said co-author Brian Prest, an economist at the non-profit Resources for the Future.
The US federal government relies on the social cost figure to inform standards for vehicle and power plant emissions and the energy efficiency of appliances. It is also used as a basis for federal tax credits on carbon capture and storage, zero emission credit payments for nuclear generators and in proposed federal carbon tax legislation.
But a 2017 report by the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine called out the federal government for using outdated research to calculate the consequences of greenhouse gas emissions.
The government’s social cost estimate relied on old climate models that generated global temperature changes inconsistent with those predicted by more sophisticated Earth systems models, the Nature study said. The estimate also did not incorporate a growing body of research on how climate change is expected to affect human wellbeing, it added.
The Trump administration then slashed the social cost estimate to below $10 per metric tonne. This allowed federal agencies to roll back fuel economy standards.
Last year, US President Joe Biden reinstated the Obama-era $51 social cost as a temporary measure and re-established the Interagency Working Group on the Social Costs of Greenhouse Gases.
Members of the working group did not respond to a request for comment. They are expected to release an updated social cost estimate later this year.
Prest and his colleagues hope the government will consider their research, which relies on improved socioeconomic projections, climate models, climate impact assessments and economic discounting, or the value that researchers today put on costs incurred by future generations.

4,Putin denies Gorbachev a state funeral,Kremlin spokesperson says Gorbachev’s ceremony will have  “elements” of a state funeral.,"MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin is to miss the funeral of the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, denying the man who failed to prevent the collapse of the Soviet empire the full state honours granted to Boris Yeltsin.
Gorbachev, idolised in the West for allowing eastern Europe to escape Soviet communist control but unloved at home for the chaos that his  “perestroika” reforms unleashed, will be buried on Saturday after a public ceremony in Moscow’s Hall of Columns.
The grand hall, within sight of the Kremlin, hosted the funerals of Soviet leaders Vladimir Lenin, Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnev. Gorbachev will be given a military guard of honour — but his funeral will not be a state one.
State television on Thursday showed Putin solemnly placing red roses beside Gorbachev’s coffin — left open as is traditional in Russia — in Moscow’s Central Clinical Hospital, where he died on Tuesday aged 91.
Putin made a sign of the cross in Russian Orthodox fashion before briefly touching the edge of the coffin.
“Unfortunately, the president’s work schedule will not allow him to do this on Sept 3, so he decided to do it today,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
He said Gorbachev’s ceremony would have  “elements” of a state funeral, and that the state was helping to organise it.
Nevertheless, it will be a marked contrast to the funeral of Yeltsin, who was instrumental in sidelining Gorbachev as the Soviet Union fell apart and hand-picked Putin, a career KGB intelligence officer, as the man most suited to succeed him.
When Yeltsin died in 2007, Putin declared a national day of mourning and, alongside world leaders, attended a grand state funeral in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour.
Russia’s intervention in Ukraine appears aimed at reversing at least in part the collapse of the Soviet Union that Gorbachev failed to prevent in 1991. Gorbachev’s decision to let the countries of the post-war Soviet communist bloc go their own way, and East and West Germany to reunify, helped to trigger nationalist movements within the 15 Soviet republics that he was powerless to quell.

5,"IAEA team visits Ukraine N-plant, to ‘stay’ for now","ZAPORIZHZHIA: UN inspectors will be  “staying” at a Russian-held nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, its head ...","ZAPORIZHZHIA: UN inspectors will be  “staying” at a Russian-held nuclear plant in southern Ukraine, its head said on Thursday after their first visit to the facility following a risky journey across the frontline despite early-morning shelling of the area.
Wearing bright blue flak jackets and helmets, the 14-strong team crossed into Russian-held territory, reaching the facility around 1200 GMT with the International Atomic Energy Agency chief describing it as a productive first visit.
“Today we were able, in these few hours, to gather a lot of information,” Rafael Grossi told reporters outside the plant.
“The key things I needed to see I saw, and their explanations were very clear.” After the inspection, in a video released by the Russian RIA Novosti news agency, Grossi said:  “We have achieved something very important today and the important thing is the IAEA is staying here.” Despite a dawn shelling attack on the area that forced the closure of one of its six reactors, the team vowed to press ahead with their risky mission to reach Europe’s biggest nuclear facility which is located on the frontlines of the fighting.
Energoatom, Ukraine’s nuclear agency, said it was  “the second time in 10 days” that Russian shelling had forced the closure of a reactor.
It said the plant’s emergency protection system kicked in shortly before 5am (0200 GMT), shutting reactor five,  “due to another (Russian) mortar shelling” and that a backup power supply  “was damaged” in the attack.
The area around the plant, which lies on the southern banks of the Dnipro River, has suffered repeated shelling, with both sides blaming the other, sparking global concern over the risk of an accident.

6,First Native elected to Congress as former governor Palin loses,Mary Peltola  defeated Republican former Governor Sarah Palin by 51.47pc to 48.53pc.,"Anchorage: Mary Peltola, a Democratic former state lawmaker, won a special election to fill Alaska’s sole US House of Representatives seat, becoming the first Alaska Native to represent the state in Congress, the Alaska Division of Elections announced on Wednesday.
She defeated Republican former Governor Sarah Palin by 51.47pc to 48.53pc. Palin is widely known for her unsuccessful vice presidential run with John McCain in 2008.
Peltola will finish the remainder of the term of Republican Representative Don Young, who died earlier this year, and will face re-election on Nov 8.
She is the first Alaska Native to represent a state where almost 20pc of the population is Indigenous, the highest proportion in the United States.
Palin’s campaign for the House seat was her first run for public office after the McCain loss. She is seen as having helped open the door to a more far-right wing of the Republican Party.
During her campaign, Peltola ran as  “Alaska’s best shot at keeping an extremist from winning,” according to her campaign website.

7,UN says China may have committed crimes against humanity in Xinjiang,New York: China’s  “arbitrary and discriminatory detention” of Uyghurs and other Muslims in its Xinjiang ...,"New York: China’s  “arbitrary and discriminatory detention” of Uyghurs and other Muslims in its Xinjiang region may constitute crimes against humanity, the outgoing UN human rights chief said in a long-awaited report on Wednesday.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, who has faced criticism from some diplomats and rights groups for being too soft on China, released the report just minutes before her four-year term ended. She visited China in May.
China has vigorously denied any abuses in Xinjiang and issued a 131-page response to the 48-page UN report. The UN Human Rights Office said in the report that serious human rights violations have been committed” in Xinjiang  “in the context of the government’s application of counter-terrorism and counter-’extremism’ strategies”.
“The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups ... may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity,” the UN office said on its website. It recommended the Chinese government take prompt steps to release all those detained in training centres, prisons or detention facilities.
“There are credible indications of violations of reproductive rights through the coercive enforcement of family planning policies since 2017,” the office said.
It added that a lack of government data  “makes it difficult to draw conclusions on the full extent of current enforcement of these policies and associated violations of reproductive rights.”  Rights groups accuse Beijing of abuses against Uyghurs, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority that numbers around 10 million in the western region of Xinjiang, including the mass use of forced labour in internment camps. The United States has accused China of genocide.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin described the report as  “completely illegal and void”.
“This proves once again that the OHCHR has become a thug and accomplice of the U.S. and the West,” he said during a regular daily briefing on Thursday in Beijing, where he was asked repeatedly about the report.
Bachelet, who is from Chile, said her report took  “considerable work and review” and emerged in the final moments of her tenure because she wanted to deal with input from the Chinese government last week.
“Dialogue and engagement is about trying to build trust incrementally - even when it seems unlikely. My own experience in Chile showed me the value of this approach,” she said.
“To be perfectly honest, the politicization of these serious human rights issues by some States did not help,” she added.  “They made the task more difficult, they made the engagement more difficult and they made the trust-building and the ability to really have an impact on the ground more difficult.”

9,Poland asks Germany for war reparations of 1.3tr euros,"Issue of World War Two compensations is closed, says Berlin","WARSAW: Poland on Thursday estimated the financial cost of World War II losses to be 1.3 trillion euros (dollars) and said it would  “ask Germany to negotiate these reparations”.
“It is a major sum of 6.2 trillion” Polish zloty, said Jaroslaw Kaczynski, head of the ruling Law and Justice party and widely considered to be Poland’s de facto leader.
Most of this sum  “is compensation for the deaths of more than 5.2 million Polish citizens,” he stressed. Kaczynski said that receiving reparations would be a  “long and difficult” process.
“It is a decision we will implement,” he said, speaking on the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s invasion of Poland on Sept 1, 1939.

Issue of World War Two compensations is closed, says Berlin 

Kaczynski was speaking at a conference dedicated to the presentation of a report on Poland’s losses in the 1939-1945 war. Since coming to power in 2015, Poland’s governing Law and Justice (PiS) party has often championed the issue of war reparations.
Work on the reparations report began in 2017, when the conservative government insisted that Germany had a  “moral duty” in the matter.
German position ‘unchanged’
Germany has often rejected Poland’s claims, pointing to a 1953 decision by Poland to renounce claims against East Germany. The German government on Thursday turned down the Polish call to negotiate on reparations.
“The German government’s position is unchanged, the reparations issue is closed,” a foreign ministry spokesman said. He cited the 1953 decision, calling it a  “significant foundation for Europe’s order today”.
The liberal Polish opposition believes the report is mainly intended for domestic political purposes, coming as it does a year ahead of parliamentary elections.
“The PiS initiative on war reparations has been appearing for several years, whenever PiS needs to build a political narrative,” said Donald Tusk, chairman of the main opposition Civic Platform (PO).
“This is not about any reparations from Germany, but a political campaign” in Poland, he added, with Kaczynski seeking to  “rebuild the support of the ruling party through this anti-German campaign”. 
But Kaczynski insisted that the reparations report needs to be acted upon. “We have not only prepared a report... but we have also taken a decision, a decision on further action,” Kaczynski said.
“That action is to ask Germany to negotiate these reparations. And this is a decision that we will implement,” he added.
“The Germans invaded Poland and did us enormous damage. The occupation was unbelievably criminal, unbelievably cruel and caused effects that in many cases continue to this day.” Apart from the overall death toll put at 5.3 million, the new report provides other shocking statistics, including that 2.1 million Polish citizens were deported to labour in Nazi Germany.
As a result of being forced to undergo pseudo-medical experiments and detention in concentration camps, 590,000 Poles were disabled.
Over the duration of the six-year World War, Poland lost 50 percent of its lawyers, 40 percent of the doctors and 35 percent of university professors.

10,Taiwan tycoon to train three million ‘civilian warriors’,"Robert Tsao, 75, is one of Taiwan’s most successful businessmen and founded major microchip maker United Microelectronics Corp.","TAIPEI: A colourful Taiwanese tycoon unveiled plans on Thursday to train more than three million  “civilian warriors” to help defend the democratic island in the event of a Chinese invasion, donating $33 million of his own money.
Robert Tsao, 75, is one of Taiwan’s most successful businessmen and founded major microchip maker United Microelectronics Corp (UMC).
He has been increasingly outspoken against Beijing, and his donation comes after China’s military put on a huge show of force to protest US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taipei last month.
Taiwan lives under constant threat of invasion by China, which claims the self-ruled island as part of its territory to be seized one day — by force if necessary.
For a week after Pelosi’s visit, China sent warships, missiles and fighter jets into the waters and skies around Taiwan, its largest and most aggressive exercises since the mid-1990s.
Tsao, who donned body armour for his announcement, warned it would be  “an intentional slaughter and vicious war crime and crime against humanity” if China were to use force against Taiwan.
The tycoon said he would put TW$600 million towards training three million  “black bear warriors” in the next three years who could work alongside the military.
Another TW$400 million will be used to train 300,000  “marksmen” with shooting skills.
Tsao, who no longer holds any position or title with UMC, portrayed the risk posed by China as existential.
