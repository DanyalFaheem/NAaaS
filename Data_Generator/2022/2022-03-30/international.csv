0,EU countries expel over 40 Russian diplomats,"BRUSSELS: EU countries Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Czech Republic on Tuesday announced the expulsion ...","BRUSSELS: EU countries Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland and the Czech Republic on Tuesday announced the expulsion of dozens of Russian diplomats suspected of spying, in coordinated action taken in the shadow of Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
Russia said it would respond in kind.
Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes said her country was kicking out 21 diplomats from Russia’s embassy in Brussels and consulate in Antwerp, giving them two weeks to leave.
She said the move was made in conjunction with the neighbouring Netherlands, whose foreign ministry said it was expelling 17 Russian diplomats considered  “secretly active” as intelligence officers.
Ireland’s Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said four  “senior officials” from Russia’s embassy in Dublin had been told to leave for engaging in activities  “not... in accordance with international standards of diplomatic behaviour” — code for spying.
The Czech foreign ministry said that one diplomat in the Russian embassy in Prague had been given 72 hours to leave. A Czech official said the diplomat was Russia’s deputy ambassador.
“Together with our Allies, we are reducing the Russian intelligence presence in the EU,” the Czech foreign ministry tweeted.
Maria Zakharova, the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, said:  “Responses will be provided on the basis of the principle of reciprocity.” She did not provide further details.
Separately, the Russian foreign ministry denounced the expulsion of Russian diplomats from the Netherlands, calling it an  “unfriendly step” and proof that Hague had no interest  “in maintaining normal diplomatic channels of communication.”  “The Dutch have outdone themselves in their desire to ‘hit’ the Russian embassy in a more painful way,” the ministry added.
The expulsions announced on Tuesday ratcheted up Western blows directed at Russia following its February 24 invasion of Ukraine. Already several rounds of sanctions engineered mainly by the EU and the US have severely sapped Russia’s economy.
Russia now considers all EU countries, along with the United States and allies including Japan, Britain and Australia, to be  “hostile” countries.
In the wake of Russia’s invasion, the United States in early March kicked out 12 Russian diplomats based in New York it deemed to be  “intelligence operatives”.
Russia retaliated last week by handing the US a list of American diplomats declared  “persona non grata”.
Poland, an EU country neighbouring Ukraine, last week expelled 45 Russian diplomats over alleged espionage, prompting Moscow to accuse Warsaw of embarking on  “a dangerous escalation”.
In April last year, the Czech Republic expelled dozens of Russian diplomats and Russia retaliated in a tit-for-tat move. Previously, Prague had accused Russian 
secret services of orchestrating blasts at an ammunition depot in eastern Czech Republic which killed two people in 2014.
Russia was left virtually isolated in the United Nations’ General Assembly on March 2 this year when an overwhelming majority of countries — 141 in total — voted to adopt a non-binding resolution demanding a halt to Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
Just five countries voted against the resolution: Russia, Syria, North Korea, Belarus and Eritrea. Another 35 abstained, including China.

1,"World could turn away from Afghanistan if girls schools stay shut, says UN official","Women are effectively shut out of most government jobs, and ordered to dress according to the Taliban’s strict interpretation.","KABUL: Afghanistan risks becoming a forgotten crisis unless the Taliban reopen schools for girls, a top UN official warned on Tuesday.
The hardline Islamists sparked outrage last week after ordering girls’ secondary schools to shut down just hours after allowing them to reopen for the first time since seizing power seven months ago.
On Tuesday Achim Steiner, head of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), warned further delays in starting classes not only harmed the girls’ future, but risks Afghanistan being ignored.
“For us and the United Nations, this is a critical moment in which the world needs to understand Afghanistan,” he told reporters in Kabul at the end of a two-day visit.
“But the leadership of Afghanistan must also recognise that the world can very easily turn to other crises.” If there were any  “technical constraints” in reopening the schools the UN will make it a  “top priority” to resolve them, Steiner said.
“But if it were to signal a more fundamental reversal on this principle, it would indeed create I think a crisis in the way that both the international community and the country could relate to one another,” he said.
The Taliban have not explained the reason for their dramatic U-turn, but senior leader Suhail Shaheen said there were  “practical issues” that needed to be resolved.
The international community has made women’s right to work and education a key condition for any foreign aid to be offered to Afghanistan, and for recognising the Taliban government.
Despite promising a softer version of their previous harsh regime, from 1996 until 2001, the Taliban restrictions have crept in.
Women are effectively shut out of most government jobs, and ordered to dress according to the Taliban’s strict interpretation.
Earlier this week, the Taliban also ordered Afghanistan’s airlines to stop women from boarding flights unless they were escorted by a  “mahram”, or adult male relative.
The Taliban have already banned women from solo inter-city travel.
During the previous Western-backed regimes that ruled Afghanistan for nearly 20 years, international aid represented 40 percent of Afghanistan’s GDP and financed 75 to 80 percent of its budget.
But that has now stopped since Afghanistan’s takeover by the Taliban, plunging the country into a deep humanitarian and economic crisis.

2,US launches satellite TV channel for Afghanistan to counter ban,Urges Taliban rulers to allow journalists and human rights defenders to operate freely and without fear.,"WASHINGTON: One day after the Taliban banned Voice of America (VOA) broadcasts from terrestrial television, the US government-funded news agency on Tuesday launched a 24/7 direct-to-home satellite-delivered television channel for Afghanistan.
In an earlier statement, the US State Department urged Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers to allow journalists and human rights defenders to operate freely and without fear.
The VOA announced that the new channel would carry “uncensored news and information” in both the Pashto and Dari languages of the country.
On March 27, the Taliban ordered VOA-affiliated Afghan television stations to stop showing VOA programmes, as part of a broad ban on content regarded as undermining Taliban policies, including prohibiting women from anchoring newscasts with men.
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Deutsche Welle also reported that their local broadcasting partners have been prevented from airing their programming in Afghanistan due to new guidelines from the Taliban.
Condemning the order, the State Department said: “It is with alarm and deep concern we learned of the Taliban’s decision to stifle the Afghan people’s access to independent, objective, international media sources.”
The VOA said its new TV stream, identified as “VOA Afghanistan,” is on the Yahsat Y-1A satellite (52.2 degrees East), Transponder 12 (downlink frequency 11.938 GHz), Channel 469. The Yahsat satellite is Afghanistan’s most popular platform, ensuring the Afghan audience will have access to VOA’s programming despite the Taliban censorship.
“Afghanistan is now one of the most repressive media markets in the world,” said Acting VOA Director Yolanda López. “Despite the Taliban’s attempt to end press freedom, VOA News stands by its Afghan audience with credible and authoritative news and information.”
The new VOA Afghanistan satellite stream includes its popular “TV Ashna” newscasts, its women’s show “Etesal,” viewer call-in programming, and programming from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Azadi radio. Additional programming is planned, including entertainment shows to fill a void in Afghanistan, where local channels cannot air music programmes.
The VOA satellite channel has been in development since August, before the fall of Afghanistan’s elected government. The channel is also accessible on YouTube and on VOA’s Pashto and Dari language websites.
The State Department described the Taliban media guidelines as “restrictive, and unpublished,” reminding Kabul’s new rulers that Washington remained committed to supporting the right of freedom of expression the world over.
The United States, the department said, was particularly interested in ensuring that  journalists and human rights defenders were allowed to “operate freely without fear of violence against them.”
The State Department noted the Taliban had continued to move Afghanistan in the wrong direction since they took Kabul and recently, they failed to uphold commitments they had made to allow women and girls to seek education. On March 23, the Taliban decided to prevent girls from attending secondary school.
“Each of these actions alone is alarming, but combined, they make clear the Taliban are not living up to the essential commitments they made to the Afghan people and the international community,” the department said.

3,Giant ice volcanoes identified on Pluto,PARIS: Strange lumpy terrain on Pluto unlike anything previously observed in the solar...,"

PARIS: Strange lumpy terrain on Pluto unlike anything previously observed in the solar system indicates that giant ice volcanoes were active relatively recently on the dwarf planet, scientists said on Tuesday.
The observation, which was made by analysing images taken by Nasa’s New Horizons spacecraft, suggests that Pluto’s interior was hotter much later than previously thought, according to a new study in the Nature Communications journal.
Rather than shooting lava into the air, ice volcanoes ooze a  “thicker, slushy icy-water mix or even possibly a solid flow like glaciers”, said Kelsi Singer, study author and planetary scientist at Colorado’s Southwest Research Institute.
Ice volcanoes were already thought to be on several chilly moons in the solar system, but Pluto’s  “look so different from anything else we ever have seen”, Singer said.
“The features on Pluto are the only vast field of very large icy volcanoes and they have a unique texture of undulating terrain.” Singer said it was difficult to pinpoint exactly when the ice volcanoes were formed  “but we believe they could be as young as a few hundred million years or even younger”.
Unlike much of Pluto, the region does not have impact craters, which means  “you cannot rule out that it is still in the process of forming even today”, she added.
Lynnae Quick, a planetary scientist at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center specialised in ice volcanoes, said the findings were  “extremely significant”.
“They suggest that a small body like Pluto, which should have lost much of its internal heat long ago, was able to hold onto enough energy to facilitate widespread geological activity rather late in its history,” she said.
“These findings will cause us to re-evaluate the possibilities for the maintenance of liquid water on small, icy worlds that are far from the Sun.” David Rothery, professor of planetary geosciences at The Open University, said  “we don’t know what could provide the heat necessary to have caused these icy volcanoes to erupt”.

4,Trump ‘more likely than not’ obstructed Congress: judge,WASHINGTON: A federal judge ruled on Monday that former US president Donald Trump  “more likely than not” ...,"WASHINGTON: A federal judge ruled on Monday that former US president Donald Trump  “more likely than not” engaged in criminal conduct with his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
Judge David Carter leveled the explosive accusation in a ruling dealing with subpoenas issued by the congressional committee investigating the Jan 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by Trump supporters.
The ruling comes amid US media reports that Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor Jared Kushner is expected to appear voluntarily for a virtual deposition before the committee this week.
“Based on the evidence, the court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress,” Carter said in a blistering 44-page ruling. The committee had sought documents from John Eastman, a conservative lawyer who provided legal advice to Trump in the wake of his November 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Carter, a Clinton appointee who serves on a US District Court in California, rejected Eastman’s attempt to block handing over emails to the committee from his account at Chapman University, the California school where he was a law professor.
Eastman notably authored memos providing dubious legal arguments for how then-vice president Mike Pence could swing the election to Trump when Congress met on January 6 to certify the results of the vote.
In his ruling, Carter noted that Trump had repeatedly urged Pence to throw out Electoral College votes from contested states and had done so in a fiery speech to his supporters shortly before the storming of Congress.
Pence resisted the pressure, and Biden was certified the winner by Congress after the Capitol was cleared of rampaging Trump supporters. “Because President Trump likely knew that the plan to disrupt the electoral count was wrongful, his mindset exceeds the threshold for acting ‘corruptly,’” the judge said.
He added that Trump likely knew his allegations of election fraud were baseless, and therefore that the plot was unlawful.
The judge’s ruling may increase pressure on Attorney General Merrick Garland to bring charges against the 75-year-old Trump over the Capitol riot, which left at least five people dead and 140 police officers injured.
Garland has declined to reveal whether Trump is the target of any Justice Department investigation but has said the probe will continue  “until we hold everyone accountable who committed criminal acts with respect to January 6.” More than 775 people have been arrested in connection with the Capitol attack. Some 280 have been charged with obstructing an official proceeding.

5,Five killed in shooting in central Israel,TEL AVIV: Israeli paramedics say at least five people were killed on Tuesday in a shooting in the central city of...,"TEL AVIV: Israeli paramedics say at least five people were killed on Tuesday in a shooting in the central city of Bnei Brak, east of Tel Aviv.
The circumstance of the incident were not immediately clear. The shooting took place two days after a shooting in the city of Hadera that left two police officers dead, and a week after a stabbing in the southern city of Beersheba in which four people were killed.
The attacks have raised concerns that there could be further violence.
Police said Tuesday’s shooting took place at two locations, apparently by a gunman riding a motorcycle.
The militant Islamic State group claimed responsibility for both attacks in the past week, in which the assailants were killed.
Israeli security services raided the homes of at least 12 Arab citizens and arrested two suspected of having ties to the militant Islamic State group in a crackdown sparked by recent deadly attacks, authorities said on Tuesday.
Hours before the raid, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the recent assaults inside Israel, which killed six people, marked a new situation that required stepped-up security measures.
Law enforcement officials said 31 homes and sites were searched overnight in northern Israel, an area that was home to the gunmen who killed two police officers and wounded four more people in the city of Hadera over the weekend.
The militant Islamic State group claimed Sunday’s attack, as well as a stabbing rampage in southern Israel last Tuesday in which four people were killed. Police shot and killed the two gunmen, and the stabber was shot and killed by a passerby, police said.
Israeli leaders condemned the killings and pointed to the timing. Both attacks came ahead of Ramazan and Sunday’s killings came on the eve of a high-profile meeting between the foreign ministers of four Arab nations and the United States in the Israeli Negev. All four Arab nations Egypt, Morocco, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates along with the United States, condemned the killings.
Hamas praised the shooting as a heroic operation. Attacks by IS inside Israel are rare.
The group operates mainly in Iraq and Syria, where it has recently stepped up attacks against security forces. It no longer controls any territory but operates through sleeper cells. IS has claimed attacks against Israeli troops in the past and has branches in Afghanistan and other countries.

6,Pakistani organisation tasked with boosting health sector capacity in 12 countries,The Health Services Academy will also hold clinical trials for developing new drugs.,"ISLAMABAD: The Health Services Academy (HSA), a public sector university in Pakistan, will help enhance the capacity of 12 Muslim countries of Africa in the public health sector under an agreement signed by the academy with the Islamic University in Uganda (IUIU) here on Tuesday. 
The agreement was signed by HSA’s vice chancellor Dr Shahzad Ali Khan and IUIU’s rector Prof Dr Ismail Simbwa Gyagenda. 
The IUIU was established by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to deal with 12 African countries. 
Under the agreement, the Resource Linkage Programme of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) and the OIC would provide financial support to the HSA which would utilise its own technical resources to achieve the objective. 
The HSA will also support the 12 African countries’ health institutions to hold clinical trials for developing new drugs as the academy has already held clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccines in Pakistan. 
Talking to Dawn, the HSA vice chancellor said that after the HSA had become a member of the Standing Committee for Scientific and Technological Cooperation, one of the four standing committees of the OIC dedicated to promotion of science and technology among member states, it was envisioned through an agreement in September that the academy would play a leading role in promoting public health in the 12 African countries. 
“Rector of Islamic University in Uganda (IUIU) Prof Dr Ismail Simbwa Gyagenda arrived in Pakistan to attend the OIC meeting held recently and then stayed back to discuss health development in 12 African countries with officials of HSA,” he said. 
Dr Khan said that it had been decided last year that top Muslim countries in terms of health facilities such as Turkey, Malaysia and Indonesia would cooperate with Pakistan to boost the latter’s health infrastructure. 
“Pakistan, on the other hand, was assigned the task by the OIC to enhance the capacity of other Muslim countries in the public health sector and for this purpose the HSA was given the task by the government to use both its physical and online mediums to train and boost up the health sector of 12 African countries,” he said. 
He said the IUIU also requested the HSA to support it to hold clinical trials of different medicines on the African people. 
Dr Khan said that collaborative work would be undertaken in research and educational activities, joint medical camps, scholarships and research fellowships, exchange of students, faculty and staff, exchange of information, capacity building activities and other areas. 
He said that African countries’ herbal medicines were very popular across the world and Pakistan could also benefit from such medicines as a number of people in the country did not want to take allopathic medicines. 
In a statement issued here, the HSA said: “It’s a matter of great pride for Pakistani nation that a public organisation of the government of Pakistan is going to support various African countries through its technical competence and vast experience in the public health. The translation of this multinational technical support shall be brought to reality through an agreement inked between IUIU based in Kampala, Uganda, and the HSA.” 
Speaking at the ceremony, Prof Gyagenda expressed his gratitude and lauded HSA’s work during Covid-19 in Pakistan.

7,Hospitals in Sri Lanka running out of life-saving drugs,"Sri Lankans are forced to spend long hours to buy food, fuel and even medicines as the dollar shortage has led to scarce imports.","COLOMBO: Sri Lanka’s state-run hospitals are running out of life-saving medicines due to a shortage of dollars needed to import essentials as the country reels from a dire economic crisis, officials said on Tuesday.
Teaching Hospital Peradeniya which serves a population of 2.4 million people in the Central province said it was suspending all routine surgeries and was out of anaesthetic drugs and other essentials for operations.
A key health trade union said the problem at Peradeniya was common in most state hospitals where suppliers had not been paid for over six months.
A surgeon at the main National Hospital in Colombo said they were short of many vital medicines and patients requiring human insulin were told to bring their own.
“The situation is very grave and we need a disaster management initiative to deal with the worsening situation,” said Ravi Kumudesh, the head of the Medical Laboratory Technologists Association (MLTA).
He said they were unable to carry out diagnostics as most chemicals and solutions needed for their tests were not freely available at state hospitals.
Meanwhile, the government said it allowed suppliers — hit by higher costs — to hike by 30 per cent prices of all medical devices, including stents for heart patients.
Sri Lankans are forced to spend long hours to buy food, fuel and even medicines as the dollar shortage has led to scarce imports in the country’s worst economic crisis since independence in 1948.
The country’s inflation hit a record 17.5 percent in February with food inflation hitting 25 per cent.
The government is seeking an IMF bailout after the country’s foreign currency reserves fell to $2.0 billion, down from $7.5 billion when the current government took over in November 2019.
Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar, who was in Sri Lanka for a regional meeting, said he was  “disturbed” by the medical shortages and asked the embassy to look into helping.
The Sri Lankan health ministry said it was also rushing fresh supplies to resume surgeries at Peradeniya. India, China and Bangladesh have stepped in to help Sri Lanka weather a foreign exchange shortage that has forced it to devalue its currency  amid soaring inflation, and to seek International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance.
Sri Lanka’s worst economic crisis in decades is a  result of mismanaged government finances and ill-timed tax cuts, alongside the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
With only $2.31 billion left in reserves, Sri Lanka has to repay debt of about $4  billion over the rest of this year, including a $1-billion international  sovereign bond that matures in July.
Last May, Bangladesh’s central bank agreed to a $200 million swap, the first swap  arrangement between the two countries.
In August, Sri Lanka received its $787 million share of the global $650 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDR) allocation from the IMF. This was part of pandemic  support extended by the lender and the funds were used to top up reserves.
Foreign Minister Basil Rajapaksa is set to hold talks with the IMF in April.
