0,Imran says remarks about judiciary in context of 1997 case,"The prime minister has the utmost respect for the judiciary, attorney general says.","• PM has utmost respect for judiciary, says AGP
• Constitution stops short of speaking on lawmakers’ integrity, observes CJP    
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday assured the Supreme Court that he had great respect and regard for the top judiciary as well as its judges, saying that at the Kamalia public gathering he was referring to the 1997 apex court storming and the circumstances leading to the controversial removal of the late chief justice, Sajjad Ali Shah.
“It was in that specific context that he was referring to his apprehensions,” Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan quoted the prime minister before a five-judge Supreme Court bench that had taken up the presidential reference, seeking interpretation of Article 63-A of the Constitution. 
At the outset of Tuesday’s hearing, the AGP explained that he had talked to the prime minister about the concerns shown by the court on Monday regarding his speech in Kamalia. 
He said the PM asked him to convey his message to the court, reiterating unreservedly his full faith and confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judges of the apex court. 
Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, who was heading the larger bench, observed that if the court assumed defection as something very dishonourable that required lifetime ban from entering the parliament, would then the court not enter the realm by trying to make the Constitution work in a certain manner or impose a system of governance.
The chief justice observed that the AGP was pleading that integrity among lawmakers be translated as ensuring party discipline, but the Constitution stopped short of that. 
AGP Khan, however, said for the last 15 to 20 years, the Supreme Court, through its judgements, had been trying to purify the process of elections by bringing transparency at the entry point before becoming a member of the parliament. 
“Our endeavour is that the same transparency and purity should also come at the middle point,” the AGP contended, emphasising these 15 or 20 opportunists who always took advantage would never let the Parliament rid the house of defection. 
While interpreting Article 63-A of the Constitution, AGP Khan said the court should infuse the universal concept of moral values.
What the court needed was to redeem over-arching democratic and constitutional values and the promise envisioned by our founding fathers, Mr Khan said, regretting that not a single conscientious person had resigned so far.
He emphasised that the elected members were bound by party discipline and if they reached a point where they could not conscientiously support the party in parliament or outside, the only option available was to resign as member of the assembly and the party.
Once there had been a declaration under Article 63-A of the Constitution that a certain member had defected, Article 62(1)(f) would automatically be triggered, the AGP said.
Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel observed that the framers of the Constitution had provided for disqualification and de-seating of the member in clear terms where they deemed it necessary.
During the hearing, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel wondered if someone voiced “a principled dissent” then would it be called defection, adding that it was the party head who could issue notice after hearing the members who defected before making up his mind.
“By imposing life-term disqualification, would the court not be punishing even those members who are honest and honourable,” Justice Mandokhel said, wondering which force let these members defect.
Justice Mandokhel also asked if the AGP considered de-seating of a member as something very small when in Balochistan people got killed or kidnapped, emphasising, “we should go into reasons which lead to defection”.
Losing a seat in the house is not something small but a very big punishment to the member, Justice Mandokhel observed, adding that when political parties, which had suffered defection at present or in the past, were silent about it why should the court fill the gap by imposing lifetime disqualification.
Justice Munib Akhtar highlighted the anomaly between Article 62 and 63 and questioned that if someone was de-seated for defection for five years, and after the disqualification period was over, decided to contest the elections, then would his rival at the time of filing of nomination papers take the plea before the returning officer that his disqualification entailed life-time bar. “This is the difficulty we are looking at,” the judge added.
Justice Ijazul Ahsan emphasised that the apex court had to strike a balance between disqualification for a limited period and for a lifetime by determining the correct intent of the framers of the Constitution so that it could serve the people and ensure continuity in a better way.
While pointing towards senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan, who was representing Shehbaz Sharif and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Justice Munib Akhtar wondered that when forming a political party was a fundamental right would it also be the party’s fundamental right to maintain its integrity that no unconstitutional means destroyed the cohesion.
The AGP argued that articles 62, 63 and 63-A were the most important provisions of the Constitution as these determined as to who would represent the people, form government and run the country.

The decision was taken at a meeting presided over by Chief Election Com­missi­oner Sikandar Sultan Raja and attended by two members and senior officials of the ECP. 
The schedule for LG polls will be issued in a day or two. 
The meeting was told that delimitation for the LG elections was under way in Quetta and Lasbela districts following an increase in constituencies by the provincial government. 
The schedule for polls in these two districts will be announced later.
During the meeting, the ECP was briefed on the ongoing revision of electoral rolls. 
The commission expr­essed satisfaction over pace of work and directed the provincial election commissioners to vigilantly monitor the revision process to ensure registration of all eligible voters. 
The meeting was informed that after a decision of the Islamabad High Court, the schedule for delimitation of the Federal Capital Territory has been re-issued.

2,IHC rejects PTI plea to keep foreign funding record ‘secret’,"Documents show party operated at least two accounts previously ""disowned"" before ECP committee.","ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday declined the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) request for suspending the orders of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) regarding the confidentiality of its foreign funding. 
The orders came alongside the revelation that contrary to its submission before the ECP’s scrutiny committee, the party was aware of and operating at least two of the ‘unauthorised’ bank accounts that it had disowned through a March 15 submission to the commission. 
On Tuesday, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani of the IHC observed that the court cannot issue an interim order without giving a proper hearing to the ECP and complainant Akbar S. Babar, a founding member of the PTI, now estranged from the party. 

Documents show party operated at least two accounts previously ‘disowned’ before ECP committee

The ECP had earlier dismissed the party’s applications seeking to exclude Mr Babar from the foreign funding case. Party secretary Asad Umar also filed a petition asking that all records of the case, including the documents requisitioned through the State Bank of Pakistan, should not be shared with the petitioner. 
When Justice Kayani took up the petition, PTI counsel Anwar Mansoor Khan argued that since the ECP has obtained the record related to foreign funding from the SBP and other sources it cannot be shared with a private citizen i.e. Mr Babar.
The court then issued notices to Mr Babar and the ECP.
Justice Kayani asked the PTI counsel whether any legal provision bars ECP from sharing the information with the complainant, and pointed out that ECP did not give undue weightage to Babar and the scrutiny committee prepared its report on the basis of record procured on its own. 
Party ‘aware’ of disowned accounts
Documents seen by Dawn show that it did have knowledge of bank accounts that were “illegally opened and operated” by some of its leaders.
In its written reply submitted to the ECP on March 15, the PTI challenged the scrutiny committee’s finding that the party had concealed several accounts in its annual audited reports for the period 2009-13.
The PTI had disowned 11 of the accounts, saying that they were opened without its knowledge, and that when they learned of their existence, they took immediate steps to disassociate themselves from the accounts in question. 
However, documentary evidence suggests that PTI’s Central Finance Board was involved in operating at least two of these accounts.
According to the documents, the Central Finance Board had adopted a resolution on Dec 2, 2012, deciding that the existing PTI account at the Peshawar Cantt branch of a private bank would be operated by new signatories. 
Signed by then-PTI central finance secretary Sardar Azhar Tariq Khan, the decision was also communicated to the bank manager whereby the previous account signatories — Shah Farman, Asad Qaisar and Imran Shahzad — were replaced with new signatories. 
The letter to the bank had been written by Saleemullah Jan, who had been listed on top of the list of the new signatories by the finance board, with explicit instructions that his signatures were necessary.
In another letter, also signed by Sardar Azhar, the decision of the PTI central finance board meeting was communicated to the chief manager of another private bank in Peshawar regarding a change in signatories of the account.
Dawn reached out to PTI cabinet ministers Shibli Faraz, Farrukh Habib as well as the party’s current Central Secretary (Finance) Siraj Ahmad to obtain the party’s version on the matter. 
But until the filing of this report, none of them replied to requests for comment, with Shibli Faraz responding simply with: “I have no idea”.

3,Rashid for early polls to cash in on Imran’s ‘high popularity graph’,Says PM to launch e-passport facility today,"ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid has once again called for holding elections immediately after Haj to cash in on the “high popularity graph of Prime Minister Imran Khan”.  
Speaking at a press conference here on Tuesday, the minister said he had advised the prime minister to unveil a pro-poor federal budget for the next financial year before the country goes for snap polls.  
“The prime minister should present a good budget because oil and wheat prices are high across the globe, there’s IMF, FATF and so many other problems ... Imran Khan should give a good budget and hold elections immediately after Haj,” he said.  

Says PM to launch e-passport facility today 

Mr Rashid said the prime minister would “play till the last ball” and expressed the hope that the no-trust motion against Mr Khan would be defeated.  
He said that international conspiracies were being hatched to oust Imran Khan. “They will fail miserably,” he asserted.  
The minister said the debate on the no-confidence resolution would begin on Thursday (March 31) and the voting on the motion would take place on April 3.  
He expressed the hope that the opposition would not be able to bring 172 members to the National Assembly on the day of voting.  
“Winning and losing is part of politics,” he remarked and noted that the majority of the people were with Imran Khan.  
“Some people lose despite winning in politics,” he added. 
Mr Rashid welcomed Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid’s decision to stand by the government and expressed the hope the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan would follow suit.  
He said that an official notification declaring the office of Punjab chief minister vacant would be issued after formal acceptance of Usman Buzdar’s resignation.  
The minister revealed that the Islamabad police foiled an attack in the capital and arrested four “terrorists”. The suspected terrorists have been identified as Mohammad Ismail, Mohammad Ismail, Zafran, and Mohammad Shehzad. One of the suspects, Raees, managed to flee, he said.  
“These terrorists had ill intentions but Allah helped us,” he said, adding that he was optimistic everything would go smoothly on April 3, too. 
Mr Rashid said that four terrorists who were involved in the Kocha Risaldar blast — a suicide attack inside a Shia mosque in Peshawar that killed over 60 people — had been killed in an operation.  
The minister said Prime Minister Imran Khan would launch the e-passport facility on Wednesday. He said the new chip-imbedded passport would have 29 latest security features. “It will be the biggest up-gradation of Pakistani passport since 2004,” he added.  
He said the e-passport holder would enjoy the e-gate facility at all airports around the world. Initially, this facility would be available for holders of red (diplomatic) and blue (official) passports.

4,"PTI cannot make Elahi Punjab CM, says Zardari","Ex-president ""surprised"" by PML-Q’s fickle nature; says opposition will soon nominate a candidate for Punjab chief minister.","ISLAMABAD: Expressing his surprise over the “sudden” decision of the Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q) to continue to be a part of the ruling alliance, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader and former president Asif Ali Zardari on Tuesday claimed that Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi would not be able to become chief minister of Punjab. 
“We will bring a change in Punjab as per our will. The PTI cannot make Pervaiz Elahi the chief minister as it does not have the numbers in the Punjab Assembly; we do,” declared a confident-looking Mr Zardari while speaking at a joint news conference which had been arranged to formally welcome an independent MNA from Balochistan, Aslam Bhootani, to the opposition’s fold. 

Ex-president ‘surprised’ by PML-Q’s fickle nature; MQM-P looking for stability at the Centre

Mr Zardari said the joint opposition would soon nominate its candidate who will become the Punjab chief minister. 
Responding to a question if he would make another attempt to woo the PML-Q, Mr Zardari said it was “too late, now”. 
The former president said he was surprised to see the PML-Q accepting the government’s offer despite the fact that Mr Elahi was with him a night before the decision and had felicitated him. 
“At midnight, they felicitated me and the next morning, they suddenly went to the other side,” said Mr Zardari, adding that the PML-Q was looking for “power” whereas they were thinking about Pakistan. 
In response to a question, Mr Zardari said that he believed and hoped that the “establishment” was neutral. 
Speaking on the occasion, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said that he hoped the courts would not let the government rig the upcoming vote on the no-confidence resolution against the prime minister. He termed March 28 a “historic day” when the joint opposition tabled the no-confidence resolution in the National Assembly and Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), a key ally of the government, announced its support to the opposition. 
Welcoming Mr Bhootani to the opposition fold, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said that the representatives of Balochistan fully understood that their issues could only be resolved by the opposition parties. He said besides BAP and Mr Bhootani, Shahzain Bugti of the Jamhoori Watan Party had also announced his support for the opposition’s no-confidence resolution. 
Replying to a question about the party’s parleys with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), the PPP chairman said Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and the Sindh cabinet members were conducting dialogues with the MQM-P, adding: “Insha Allah, a good news is expected.” 
“As far as the MQM is concerned, there is not a single demand of theirs that we did not agree to. The PPP has decided to find mutual ground with the MQM and form a long-term working relationship for the sake of Karachi and Pakistan,” he added. 
For its part, the MQM-P believes that the country needs a new government at  the earliest, and it does not want to take a decision that may antagonise  the establishment.
“[The government] proved to be  incompetent. We need a PML-N govt without friction with Pindi as soon as  possible,” said a senior MQM-P leader. “But Imran Khan’s ouster and  stopgap government then interim government then elections will be a  recipe for disaster and bring more instability.”
When asked  as to why it hasn’t taken any decision despite having offers from both the government and opposition, he replied: “[We are] working on different  ideas with all parties at the moment.”
“No,” was his answer when asked whether the establishment had made its tilt clear to the MQM-P. 
At the Tuesday presser, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said the speaker now could not even think of doing something unconstitutional. The united opposition, he said, had all the numbers and more than they needed to defeat Imran Khan. 
“This is Imran’s last week. No matter what threat he hurls, the united opposition will succeed. The ministers and bureaucracy should realise that it’s their last week too,” he added. 
PML-N leader Ayaz Sadiq and BNP-M chief Akhtar Mengal were also present in the news conference. 
Afterwards, Mr Bhutto-Zardari left for the residence of PML-N president and opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif for a meeting of the joint opposition to discuss the future strategy for the upcoming National Assembly session as well as the situation emerging in Punjab after submission of the resignation by Chief Minister Usman Buzdar.
Azfar-ul-Ashfaque in Karachi also contributed to this report.

5,"Govt wants to thwart political process thru reference,  says PML-N",Says the govt is trying to get democracy “purified through the intervention of the apex court by impeding the political process”.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has taken a plea before the Supreme Court that through the presidential reference on Article 63-A of the Constitution, the government was trying to get democracy “purified through the intervention of the apex court by impeding the political process”.
“Such pleas for purity cannot disguise what is sought: a thwarting of the political process,” the PML-N argued before a five-judge Supreme Court bench, which is hearing a presidential reference seeking life-long disqualification for legislators determined to have defected under Article 63A of the Constitution. 
Moved through senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan, the reply contended that the reference was premature, vague and speculative. It seeks a declaration in advance with regard to the consequences which may flow from an exercise of vote in a particular way by members of National Assembly of a particular party.
The PML-N argued that the reference seeks the Supreme Court’s intervention to eliminate dissent by declaring, as constitutional, a consequence not stated in the Constitution. Thus the reference seeks nothing short of liquidating the political life and future, as legislators, of the dissenters.
Dissent is sought to be curbed by suppressing dissenters, the PML-N statement observed.
“None of the members have defected in terms of Article 63-A of the Constitution and that mere criticism of government or its head or its policies is not defection.” According to the PML-N, the reference pleads with the apex court to declare that anyone who goes against the party line during a vote in parliament stands disqualified for life from being elected a legislator and that his vote will be disregarded.
It is a trite law that legal proceedings are not undertaken by the courts merely for academic reasons, the reply stated, adding the Constitution specifies in Article 63-A what constitutes defection and its consequences.
“The reference, however, on the basis of assumptions, seeks a blanket ruling with respect to a possible exercise of vote in a particular manner. This is both extraordinary and impermissible.” 
The PML-N contended the reference “seeks rewriting of the Constitution. The government wants the Supreme Court to read the word “disqualification” into Article 63-A on the premise that since no duration of “disqualification” was provided, the words “life-time” be inserted by the apex court, the reply said. The government would rather that a vote against the prime minister by any member of his party be disregarded, the PML-N argued. 
“The reference does not seek an interpretation of the constitutional text and seeks to read the current political needs of the leader of a political party into the text of the Constitution under the thin guise of an unsullied and pure political process.” 
The object is to intimidate and threaten dissenters, the party feared.
The partisan use of Article 186 by the President to satisfy such needs threatens to make the Head of State a “football for the contending factions”, the PML-N reply observed. 
According to the reply, the reference raised no questions of law or public importance. “All it sought is that the transient political expediency of the day be declared a constitutional principle.”

6,Imran asks party MNAs to skip voting day session,ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan has directed all 155 members of the National Assembly (MNAs) belonging to the...,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan has directed all 155 members of the National Assembly (MNAs) belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) to abstain from attending the NA session on the day of voting on no-confidence motion against him, asking only the designated members of the party to defend him during the debate on the opposition’s move.
The motion was tabled in the assembly on March 28 and Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid believes the voting on the resolution would take place on April 3 or 4 after debate on it. In all, the PTI has 155 members in the 272-member House, whereas the opposition needs to secure at least 172 votes in order to make their no-trust move against the prime minister successful.
In an identical letter to all the 155 lawmakers of the ruling party, PM Khan warned the MNAs that they could be de-seated from the parliament under Article 63-A of the Constitution if they attended the session on the day of voting against him.
“No member of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf shall attend or make himself/herself available at the time and day of voting on the resolution of no-confidence,” the prime minister cautioned the legislators in the letter.
Mr Khan wrote to them that being head/leader of the parliamentary party of PTI in the NA, he took an opportunity to convey to the PTI MNAs the following directives which were to be followed strictly with regard to the no-confidence motion against him.
On March 28, leave was granted to move the resolution in terms of Rule 37 (4) of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007. The resolution shall be voted upon within a period of seven days.
“All the members of the parliamentary party of the PTI in NA shall abstain from voting/ not attend the meeting of the NA on the date when the said resolution is set out on the agenda of the NA for voting,” the letter said.
In the letter, the PM stated: “Duly designated parliamentary members will speak on behalf of the PTI during the course of debate on this motion and all members are required to adhere to these directions in true letter & spirit and keep in mind the intent behind the provision of Article 63-A of Constitution of Pakistan, 1973.”
He made it clear to all PTI members “no member shall violate any instruction or extend any favour, relating to the vote of no confidence, to any other parliamentary party/group whatsoever. Every/any violation of these directions shall be treated as express defection in terms of Article 63-A”.
