0,"2,500 schoolteachers sacked in Punjab for not submitting B.Ed degree",The Punjab School Education Department has called a meeting  on April 1 to discuss the removal of the teachers from service.,"LAHORE: The Punjab School Education Department (SED) on Tuesday sacked 2,500 teachers from service for not submitting their B.Ed degrees — a condition of their job contract.  
The sacked teachers include elementary school educators (ESE), senior elementary school educators (SESE) serving in BS-14 and 15.
These teachers were recruited in 2012, 2014, 2016, and 2017 on contract basis and were directed to complete the B.Ed in two years time.
An SED official told Dawn the teachers were first given two years time to fulfill the B.Ed condition of their contract, and later the department allowed an additional year to them because of the coronavirus pandemic, setting December 2021 as the deadline. 
However, he said despite getting three years time, these teachers could not complete the condition of their contract and were removed from service.
The sacked teachers also include those who could not complete their degree within their contractual period of five years.
However, the official said, contracts of thousands of teachers who had submitted the B.Ed  degrees were extended.
Meanwhile, the SED has called a meeting to discuss the removal of the teachers from service on April 1, to be presided over by Special Secretary Zaheer Hassan. The representatives of the Punjab Teachers Union, additional secretary DPI and director school will also attend the meeting. Punjab Teacher Union (PTU) leader Rana Liaqat told Dawn that he would attend the meeting and request the department to withdraw the order of removal of the teachers from service.
He said the department was already facing an acute shortage of teaching staff and removal of hundreds of teachers would adversely impact the education of students in the new academic year.
He said most of the teachers failed to submit their degree because of the coronavirus pandemic as no B.Ed examination were conducted. 
He added that the time extended by the department also lapsed due to the pandemic.

1,Students in Lahore come out in support of college teachers,College teachers are holding a sit-in to demand pay and service protection.,"LAHORE: A large number of students and teachers from the Dyal Singh College on Tuesday held a protest at Lakshmi Chowk in support of the public college teachers’ sit-in being held outside the Civil Secretariat for the last 23 days.  
The students raised slogans in support of the protesting teachers and supported their demands. 
The college teachers, including the Punjab Professors and Lecturers Association (PPLA), Young Lecturers Association and Nawa-i-Astaza, are holding the sit-in to demand pay and service protection. The protesters are blocking the road in protest against the bureaucracy and the government for delay in acceptance of their demands. The teachers are also boycotting the classes in all colleges of the province from 10am to 11am daily.  
Though the service of the contract lecturers from the four batches was regularised, their contract service period was not counted while the related service benefits were also not given to them, the protesters said.  
The teachers added that the government had accepted their demands in 2019 and they had ended their sit-in while a summary was also prepared to address the issue. 
However, the summary was not forwarded to the chief minister, they said and added that they would not end the sit-in until issuance of an order to the effect.

2,Commissioner  presents price control report to LHC,LAHORE: The commissioner of Lahore division on Tuesday presented before the Lahore High Court a mechanism to control...,"LAHORE: The commissioner of Lahore division on Tuesday presented before the Lahore High Court a mechanism to control prices and supply of the essential commodities, especially sugar, ghee, chicken meat/eggs, vegetables, fruits and flour, during the holy month of Ramzan.  
A written report submitted by Commissioner Muhammad Usman said a mechanism for price control and supply chain had been devised which would be implemented as a pilot project for the five essential commodities.  
As per the proposed mechanism, officers of the provincial government will look after various commodities. They will not only fix the prices of those commodities but also take steps to monitor the supply of that commodity and intervene whenever required. These officers will be called controller generals.  
The report said the controller generals would be facilitated through an online portal for the registration and monitoring of the producers, importers and dealers. The mechanism had been devised under the Price Control and Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act 1977.  
Justice Shahid Jamil Khan directed the government to issue the draft notification of the mechanism after some reconsideration within two days and adjourned the hearing till April 1.
The judge was hearing a petition filed by Judicial Activism Panel chairman Azhar Siddique seeking a direction to the government to ensure that the citizens continue to get the essential commodities at controlled prices during Ramzan. He submitted that every year profiteers and hoarders played havoc with the consumers during the fasting month and the authorities concerned remained indifferent to their duties to control prices.

4,Price surveillance in Lahore leaves much to be desired,Rates of daily commodities have shot through the roof ahead of Ramazan.,"LAHORE: As the prices of daily commodities are going up ahead of Ramzan, the city district administration, market committees and other departments concerned have failed to control the situation either due to meagre interest or other engagements.
“When the chief executive of our country says that he has not become the PM to control or deal with the potato and tomato prices, what can a common person expect from the government machinery — commissioner, deputy and assistant commissioners, market committee secretaries and other concerned,” deplores a man while talking to Dawn at a grocery shop in Johar Town.  
“You can check the prices of various items that have massively (200 to 350 per cent) increased during the last three years or so. And even todate, the prices are going up on a weekly basis,” he continued. 

Rates of daily commodities have shot through the roof ahead of Ramazan

According to the shopkeeper, the per litre cooking oil price has now increased to Rs490 that was Rs160 to Rs180 three years back.  
The egg per dozen price, which was Rs90 to 110 in winter and Rs80 or so in summer three years before, touched a figure of Rs200 (winter) and Rs140 in summer. The rice price was Rs90 per kilo and now it is Rs180. The soap price (large piece) was Rs50 that has now reached Rs80, followed by sugar that is now being sold at Rs90 and it was Rs55 three years back.   
The milk price (loose) was at Rs80 that has now reached to Rs130 or so. The flour price (per 20 kg bag /fine atta) was Rs650 to 700, but it has no reached Rs1,200. The Chakki Atta price was Rs45 that is now at Rs90 per kg in open market. “Similarly the prices of other items also surged and has now gone beyond the affordability limit,” he added. 
At utility stores, the prices of commodities also surged like the open market and the discount offered to public at large remained meagre. Similarly the Ramzan subsidy of over Rs8 billion reportedly announced by the government (Rs3,000 per family) is yet to be in place, as the utility stores have no information in this regard.  
“We have come to know that the subsidy has been announced. But still we need a notification that allows our computer system to give ration to the deserving at subsidised rates,” a salesman told this reporter at a utility store.  
He said under the subsidy, the cooking oil of various companies - not of leading brands - will be given to the needy people for Rs260 per litre instead of Rs380 or so. 
On the other hand, the retail prices being fixed daily by the market committees seem increasing as shown in the government’s own lists, despite the fact these are much higher in the open markets than those fixed. 
According to March 21 price lists, the onion price was Rs36 per kg that was shown as increased to Rs42 in the March 28 list. Similarly, Kachnar was available for Rs155 on March 21, but it, in the March 28 list, was shown as increased to Rs187 per kg.  When contacted, Lahore Market Committee Secretary Shahzad Cheema admitted the fact of massive price hike in the open market, stating that the government is trying hard to bring down the rates by adopting various techniques. “We even managed to provide fruits and vegetables at wholesale rates to chain-stores through auctions held at the vegetable markets. And we succeeded in regulating the prices. But we couldn’t succeed in regulating the prices at a large number of small shops and stores in the open market unfortunately,” he explained. 
He said he had given a proposal to the administration to organise small Mandis in the city since its operational cost is much less than the shops in the open markets. “This is the only way to regulate prices and provide several items to the people at discounted rates. Let’s see how the administration responds to the suggestion,” he said.

5,‘16m Pakistanis suffering from genetic disorders’,German neurologist offers ‘first rare disease centre’ at Children’s Hospital,"LAHORE: Leading German neurologist Prof Dr Arndt Rolfs says about 16 million people, mostly children, are living in Pakistan with any form of a rare genetic disorder.  
“The data represents worldwide the highest frequency in a country for these diseases,” Prof Rolfs told Dawn here on Tuesday.  
Prof Rolfs, German healthcare and genetic diagnostics organisation Arcensus’s chief executive officer, was on a visit to Pakistan along with his team members. He shared the disturbing figures about the individuals living with rare genetic disorders in the country after organising testing camps at major cities including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Multan and Lahore. The team attended hundreds of patients and their families for the diagnosis of the rare genetic disorders free of cost.  
Arcensus also organised the first symposium “Genetics Matters to Everyone” together with Prof Dr Huma Cheema of the Children’s Hospital & Institute of Child Health in Lahore at Anne Marie Schimmel Institute. The event was meant to raise awareness and find solutions to the “silent pandemic” of genetic diseases often caused by the high rate of consanguinity in Pakistan.  
The event was joined by former Pakistan cricket team captain Misbahul Haq, former German hockey player Stefan Blocher and Pakistan hockey coach Siegfried Aikman who participated as “Ambassadors for Genetics”.  

German neurologist offers ‘first rare disease centre’ at Children’s Hospital

While concluding his sessions/activities in Lahore and other cities here on Tuesday, Prof Rolfs announced that he was willing to establish ‘first rare disease centre’ in collaboration with German and Punjab governments at Children’s Hospital, Lahore. He said the German government would spend most of the funds required to establish the centre which would provide an access to diagnosis of the genetic disorders and clinical trial.  
“We would provide training to the human resource to enable them to run the medical and surgical equipment,” Prof Rolfs said. He described this huge problem for Pakistan as mostly based on the extremely high frequency of cousin marriages.  
“A genetic disease appears when a partner carries a change (mutation) in a gene associated with an illness and the other partner has the same mutation; the child inherits two copies of this gene, and thus develops a disorder,” he said. The likelihood of such a genetic disease is a lot higher if both partners are related, e.g. cousins, Prof Rolfs said. 
“Not only it is a huge burden on affected families but also on the healthcare system and on society in general,” he said.  
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the genetic diseases are causing 12-14 per cent damage to Pakistan’s economy, he said.  
The German neurologist declared that early diagnosis of genetic diseases was crucial for the future of Pakistani generations to live a longer and healthier life. According to him, the first step is to educate people about the impact of cousin marriages on genetic diseases for children. “The next step is to introduce clinical screening by a trained professional,” he said.  
Prof Dr Huma Cheema, head of the Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, said Prof Rolfs had been working on diagnosing genetic diseases in Pakistan for more than 10 years. 
“With his company Arcensus and the advanced genetic testing technique Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) more than 2,000 Pakistani children have been diagnosed with a genetic disorder over the last year alone – completely free of cost to help them and their families live a better life,” she said.  
Earlier, Punjab Health Minister Prof Dr Yasmin Rashid had given assurance about her cooperation with German neurologists.

The...","LAHORE: The Dramatics Club of the Government College University (GCU) staged an Urdu play Jalinoos on Tuesday. 
The drama that takes a dig at religious hypocrisy prevailing in society will be performed on Wednesday (today) and Thursday.  
The script by veteran actor and writer Khalid Ahmed is an Urdu adaptation of Tartuffe (The Imposter), a four centuries old theatrical comedy by French playwright Molière.  
The first day of the play on Tuesday attracted a large audience, including students. Renowned actor and director Usman Pirzada, himself an old Ravian, and playwright Asghar Nadeem Syed came to see the performance. The set was realistic and the acting was good by almost all the actors.  
The play has been directed by GCUDC advisors Irfan Randhawa, Sumaira Khalil and GCU DC President Sheikh Mubashir Mehmood while Fine Arts Department faculty member Amna Anwar designed the stage as the art director.   
The cast included Salman Tahir as Baba Jalinoos, Rana Ali Nawaz, Tanya Kiyara, Raisa Riaz, Younaib Zahra, Ali Gohar, Zubair Ghafoor, Zainab Talat, Sheikh Mubashar Mahmood, Zain Cheema, Ahmad Mughal, Abdullah Tahir and Akshat Kumar.  
Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Asghar Zaidi said the students had flawlessly performed the play revolving around the story of an imposter, a Jali Baba, who destroyed the lives of innocent people.  
“A simple and innocent man gets into the trap and is willing to do anything for this imposter. The cheap tactics used by Baba Jalinoos to achieve his vicious ends are the central plot of this play,” he added.  
He also said that the play aptly demonstrates the religious hypocrisy in our society, which needed to be highlighted.  
Usman Pirzada recalled the days when he was a student at the GC and he used to be a part of stage plays regularly.

District Education Authority Chief Executive Officer Chaudhry Muhammad Liaquat Ali said the complaints of stench and vermin had been received and he would speak to the chief officer Municipal Committee and the deputy commissioner to work out a solution to the problem.
