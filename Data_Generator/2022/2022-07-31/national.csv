0,Imran ‘abettor’ in $250m laundering case: minister,Musadik Malik questions 2018 decision to declare PTI chief “honest and truthful”.,"ISLAMABAD: Days after a report in British daily the Financial Times revealed that incarcerated Abraaj Group chief Arif Naqvi bankrolled the PTI, Minister of State for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik on Saturday termed the party chief Imran Khan an “abettor” in the $250 million money-laundering scam while PML-N leader Mohammad Zubair dared Mr Khan to “come clean” and challenge the news story in a court. 
Addressing a press conference, Dr Malik, without naming anyone, questioned a decision by the Supreme Court in 2018 that had declared the PTI chairman “honest and truthful” in a disqualification case against him.
The PML-N leader said Imran Khan was the “guarantor” of Arif Naqvi, chief executive of the Abraaj Group who was indicted by US prosecutors in a range of cases and faces up to 291 years in jail if found guilty. Dr Malik claimed that Mr Khan was the “abettor” in a $250 million money laundering case.
“How can people like Imran Khan be declared sadiq (truthful) and amin (honest),” he questioned, linking the former premier with the Abraaj scam. According to the minister, Nawaz Sharif, on the other hand, was disqualified for life for not “taking anything from the company of his son”.

Musadik Malik questions 2018 decision to declare PTI chief ‘sadiq’ and ‘amin’

The minister said the $250 million money-laundering scam amounted to a quarter of the IMF’s $1.1 billion tranche to Pakistan, expected to be released in August. “How could an abettor and protector of this illegal activity be declared sadiq and amin?” he wondered. 
In a further swipe at Mr Khan, he said Mr Khan lived in a “200-300 kanals’ house in Banigala”, but he claimed that he had no income source despite his “luxurious lifestyle”.
He said Arif Naqvi was the person who, being the chief executive of a foreign company, established a cricket club abroad and sent funds to the PTI, adding that these funds were illegal as per Pakistani laws.
As per the law of the land, he said, no political party could get funds from anyone other than Pakistani citizens and if anyone received finances from a foreign national or company, it would be “black and illegal money”. 
Separately, PML-N leader Mohammad Zubair said this was a moment for PTI chief Imran Khan to “come clean” by accounting for his party’s funds and challenging the Financial Times story in court.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad on Saturday, Mr Zubair also urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu notice and summon Mr Khan in the eight-year-long prohibited funding case, of which the news story was a “small part”.
Dr Malik and Mr Zubair’s statements are the latest in a string of criticism of the PTI over the prohibited funding case and demands by the ruling coalition for the case’s closure. 
Mr Khan has defended the funding from Mr Naqvi and said that all the funds came through banking channels and were disclosed in the party’s audited accounts.
Financial Times report
In his report published on Thursday, Simon Clark — the author of The Key Man, a book exposing the dealings of business tycoon Arif Naqvi — revealed how funds collected through charity cricket matches were used for the rise of PTI.
The report said fees were paid to Wootton Cricket Ltd, which, despite the name, was in fact a Cayman Islands-incorporated company owned by Naqvi and the money was being used to bankroll the PTI. 
Funds poured into Wootton Cricket from companies and individuals, including at least £2m from a UAE government minister who is also a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family.

1,PTI’s Wasiq elected Punjab Assembly deputy speaker,PML-N moves LHC against speaker’s ‘illegal’ election; claims secrecy of ballot was violated...,"

Wasiq Qayyum Abbasi

 
LAHORE: A day after removing Dost Mohammad Mazari through a no-trust motion, PTI’s Wasiq Qayyum Abbasi was elected unopposed as Punjab Assembly’s deputy speaker on Saturday, while PML-N moved the court against Friday’s speaker election. 
Mr Abbasi — who had the support of both PTI and PML-Q — faced no challenge from the opposition as no candidate from the other side of the isle filed nomination papers for Saturday’s contest. 
Mr Mazari, a defected PTI MPA, was voted out late Friday night after the ruling coalition managed to secure 186 votes required to make the motion successful. 
However, it was a challenging situation for the PTI-PML-Q alliance as a vote of no confidence required an absolute majority — more than half of the total strength of the house — despite vacant seats. In the case of the 371-member assembly, the required number was 186, which was just what the coalition had. 

PML-N moves LHC against speaker’s ‘illegal’ election; claims secrecy of ballot was violated

His ouster came after PTI leader Sibtain Khan comfortably won the contest for the Punjab Assembly speaker’s office. He secured 185 votes to defeat the opposition PML-Ns’ Saiful Malook Khokhar, who bagged 175 ballots, while four votes were rejected. 
Mr Mazari was also heckled by PTI lawmakers, including former provincial education minister Murad Raas, when he arrived at the speaker’s desk to cast his vote. 
In a separate move, PML-N on Saturday moved the Lahore High Court (LHC) challenging Mr Khan’s election, which it claimed “was held in an unconstitutional manner”. 
On Friday, Opposition leader Hamza Shehbaz announced that the election would be challenged after the chair turned down the demand for re-polling. 
PML-N MPAs Saiful Malook Khokhar and Mian Abdul Rauf filed a joint petition through Advocate Mansoor Usman Awan. 
A two-judge bench comprising Justice Muzamil Akhtar Shabir and Justice Raheel Kamran would hear the petition on Monday. 
According to the petitioners, the election of the speaker without a secret ballot was a “blatant violation of the Constitution”. 
Secret ballot
Under the law, the speaker’s election was to be held through secret ballot as required under Article 226 of the Constitution read with Rule 9 of the Rules of Procedures of the assembly. However, when the voting commenced on Friday, it came to the petitioners’ knowledge that the election was not being held through a secret ballot. 
The ballot papers and counterfoils had serial numbers in such a manner that each MPA’s vote could be identified by comparing the serial number on the ballot paper with the serial number and signatures of MPAs on the counterfoils, the petition explained. 
Calling the election illegal and without jurisdiction, the petitioners also attached the serial numbered ballot papers with the petition. 
The petitioners stated that they immediately pointed out this fact to the presiding officer and the assembly’s secretary verbally and moved a written application as well, but they refused to take any action. 
Instead, they called the assembly’s security to attack the petitioners and their supporters, said the applicants. 
The petition argued that the respondents, through their actions, violated the constitutional rights of the petitioners and the citizens of Pakistan guaranteed under Article 17(2) and Article 5 of the Constitution. 
The Constitution has empowered the court to examine and adjudicate the validity of the assembly’s proceedings if they contravene the substantive or procedural provisions of the Constitution, the petition maintained. 
The petitioners urged the court to set aside the election for being held in violation of the Constitution and order a fresh election. 
The petitioners have also requested the court to restrain Sibtain Khan from exercising powers and performing functions of the speaker till the matter was decided. 
Talking to the media after submitting the petition, PML-N’s deputy secretary general and prime minister’s special assistant Attaullah Tarar said the PML-Q has hijacked the PTI and committed blatant rigging during the speaker’s election. 
Taking a jibe at Parvez Elahi, Mr Tarar called him a “judicial chief minister” and alleged that he has been brought to give an NRO to Farah Khan, a friend of former prime minister Imran Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, and facing corruption inquiries.

3,Fight against human trafficking to continue: Alvi,Says Pakistan has embarked upon stringent anti-trafficking measures to enforce legal frameworks in line with global standards.,"ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi said that Pakistan was committed to combating the menace of human trafficking by establishing an effective coordination infrastructure to prosecute traffickers and protect victims.
He said this on Saturday in a message on the World Day against Trafficking in Persons.
The day was observed annually on July 30 to raise awareness regarding the plight of victims of human trafficking and to promote and protect their rights. The day was observed to bring attention to a crime that left a lasting toll on human lives and society as a whole. It was one of the most serious human rights violations that brought high profits to traffickers through the exploitation of human beings by illegal means such as force, fraud or deception.
Dr Alvi said that Pakistan had embarked upon stringent anti-trafficking measures to enforce legal frameworks in line with international standards.
“Pakistan has enacted the Trafficking in Person Act, 2018 to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, especially women and children. This law prescribed imprisonment of up to ten years for the perpetrators of such illegal acts,” the president said.
The National Coordination Committee on Human Traffi­cking had been constituted under the chair of the Minister for Interior. The committee was responsible for steering national efforts in the fight against all forms of human trafficking, including bonded labour and sex trafficking. All relevant departments at the provincial level, including Social Welfare, Labour, Police, Child Protection and NGOs were made part of provincial and district anti-human tra­fficking committees for close coordination to effectively identify and protect victims of human trafficking, he said.
According to the president, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), in collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, had prepared National Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking and Migrant Smu­ggling (2021-2025). The action plan highlighted the roles of different stakeholders and provides a holistic framework for the national response.
“I would take this opportunity to extend my appreciation and acknowledgement to the federal and provincial governments and all other relevant stakeholders who came together to fight this crime,” he said.
