Russia has already cut off gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria, Finland, the Netherlands and Denmark, which refused to pay for gas in line with an order by President Vladimir Putin requiring rouble accounts to be set up in a Russian bank. Russia has also halted gas sales to Shell Energy Europe in Germany.
“Today, Gazprom suspended its gas supplies to Latvia... due to violations of the conditions” of purchase, the company said on Telegram.
The Russian state-run company had earlier announced it would choke supply to 33 million cubic metres a day — half the amount it has been delivering since service resumed last week after 10 days of maintenance work.
European Union states have accused Russia of squeezing supplies in retaliation for Western sanctions over Moscow’s intervention in Ukraine.
Gazprom cited the halted operation of one of the last two operating turbines for the pipeline due to the “technical condition of the engine”.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has blamed EU sanctions for the limited supply.
The EU this week agreed a plan to reduce gas consumption in solidarity with Germany, where the Nord Stream pipeline runs to, warning of Russian “blackmail”.
Edijs Saicans, deputy state secretary on energy policy at the Latvian Economy Ministry, said Gazprom’s move would have little effect given that Latvia has already decided to ban Russian gas imports from Jan. 1, 2023. “We do not see any major impacts from such a move,” he said.

1,Sadr’s supporters break into Iraqi parliament,Sadr’s supporters throw stones as police fire teargas and stun grenades; UN calls for de-escalation.,"BAGHDAD: Thousands of supporters of Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr stormed Baghdad’s fortified government zone and broke into parliament on Saturday for the second time in a week, leaving at least 125 people injured and escalating a political stand-off.
Protesters rallied by Sadr and his Sadrist Movement tore down concrete barriers and entered the Green Zone, which houses government departments and foreign missions, before breaking into parliament.
“We are calling for a government free from corruption ... and those are the demands of the people,” one protester, Abu Foad, said among crowds of protesters carrying placards with Sadr’s photograph and national flags.
The scenes followed similar protests on Wednesday, although this time at least 125 people, including demonstrators and police, were wounded, according to a health ministry statement.

UN calls for de-escalation

Sadr’s supporters threw stones and police fired teargas and stun grenades. “We Iraqis have endured injustices because of those corrupt people,” said another protester, Alaa Hussain.
“I have two unemployed children who graduated from university and I am unemployed. There are no jobs and that is all because of corruption.” 
Sadr’s party came first in an October election but he withdrew his 74 lawmakers from parliament after failing to form a government that excluded his rivals. His withdrawal ceded dozens of seats to Coalition Framework.
Sadr has since made good on threats to stir up popular unrest if parliament tries to approve a government he does not like, saying it must be free of foreign influence and the corruption that has plagued Iraq for decades. His supporters chanted against his rivals who are now trying to form a government. Many protested in front of the country’s Supreme Court, which Sadr has accused of meddling to prevent him from forming a government.
In response, the Coalition Framework called on Iraqis to protest peacefully “in defence of the state, its legitimacy and its institutions,” a statement read later on Saturday, raising fears of clashes.
UN urges de-escalation
The United Nations called for a de-escalation. “Voices of reason and wisdom are critical to prevent further violence,” said its mission in Iraq. 
Because of the deadlock, the country has been without a president and prime minister for about 10 months. 
Sadr, whom opponents also accuse of corruption, maintains large state power himself because his movement remains involved in running the country. His loyalists sit in powerful positions throughout Iraqi ministries and state bodies.
Iraqis, linked neither to Sadr nor to his opponents, say they are caught in the middle of the political gridlock.
While Baghdad earns record income from its vast oil wealth, the country has no budget, frequent power and water cuts, poor education and healthcare, and insufficient job opportunities for the young.

2,Pope calls abuse at Canada’s church schools ‘genocide’,"Francis hints at ""slowing down"" or resigning.","ROME: Pope Francis said on Saturday the decades-long abuse of indigenous schoolchildren across Canada amounted to “genocide”, as he warned upon his return to Rome that he needed to slow down his travel pace — or resign. 
During his six-day “penitential pilgrimage” across Canada this week, the 85-year-old pope offered a historic apology to the First Nations, Metis and Inuit people, who have been waiting for years for such an acknowledgement from the head of the world’s 1.3 billion Catholics. 
Aboard the papal plane, he used the word “genocide” to describe the decades of maltreatment and sexual abuse against Canada’s Indigenous children, who were wrenched from their families and cultures to attend state schools run by the Church. 
“I didn’t say the word [in Canada] because it didn’t come to my mind, but I did describe the genocide. And I asked for forgiveness for this process which was genocide,” he told reporters. 

Francis hints at ‘slowing down’ or resigning

Although Francis’s unprecedented apology was mostly welcomed across Canada, from western Alberta to Quebec and the far north, many survivors said much more needed to be done for reconciliation. 
The pope, who spent much of the trip in a wheelchair due to knee pain, told reporters his international trips were numbered. 
“I don’t think I can go at the same pace as I used to travel,” Francis said. 
“I think that at my age and with this [knee] limitation, I have to save myself a little bit to be able to serve the Church. Or, alternatively, to think about the possibility of stepping aside,” he added. 
It was not the first time Francis has said that — should his health require it — he could take a page from his predecessor Benedict XVI, who made history in 2013 by stepping down due to declining physical and mental health. 
‘Evil perpetrated’ 
Francis wrapped up his journey on Friday in the capital of the vast northern territory of Nunavut, Iqaluit, which means “the place of many fish”. 
There, he asked for forgiveness for “the evil perpetrated” by Catholics in the 139 residential schools across Canada run by the Catholic Church, where about 150,000 Indigenous children were sent from the late 1800s to the 1990s. 
“I want to tell you how very sorry I am and to ask for forgiveness for the evil perpetrated by not a few Catholics who contributed to the policies of cultural assimilation,” he said. 
Many were physically and sexually abused at the schools, and thousands are believed to have died of disease, malnutrition or neglect, in what a truth and reconciliation commission later called a “cultural genocide”. 
Residents in Iqaluit, a community of just over 7,000 people and where small houses line the rocky ocean shore, have listened closely to the pope’s words throughout his trip. 
“He did apologise, and a lot of people don’t seem to be happy with it, but he took that step to come to Nunavut... and I think that’s big,” lifelong Iqaluit resident Evie Kunuk, 47, told AFP. 
Regarding his ailing knee, Francis said surgery was not an option. “Technicians say yes but there is the whole problem of anaesthesia... You don’t play around, you don’t joke with anaesthesia,” he said. 
“But I’m going to try to continue to take trips and be close to people, because I believe it’s a way to serve, to be close.” 
The trip to Canada was Francis’s 37th international voyage since becoming pope in 2013. 
But travelling has become increasingly difficult for the pope, who has appeared fragile in recent months, and he has cancelled public appearances.
