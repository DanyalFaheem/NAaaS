BIRMINGHAM: An improvement from Friday but a loss nonetheless.
A day after being blanked by India in their opening Group ‘A’ tie, Pakistan lost 3-2 to Australia in the mixed team badminton event of the Commonwealth Games on Saturday despite having taken a 2-1 lead after the opening three matches.
Pakistan were due to wrap up their team event against Sri Lanka later on Saturday with the team having no chance of progressing to the next round.
After Murad Ali and Ghazala Siddique had lost 21-17, 21-17 to Australians Jack Yu and Kaitlyn Ea in their opening mixed doubles, Mohammad Irfan Saeed Bhatti and Mahoor Shahzad won their singles matches to give Pakistan the lead. 
First Irfan overcame Jacob Schueler 21-18, 21-16 before Mahoor earned a narrow 21-18, 21-19 win over Tiffany Ho.
However, the demands of playing multiple matches finally took its toll on Pakistan shuttlers.
Australia levelled matters when Yu and Tran Hoang Pham beat Murad and Irfan 21-11, 21-19 in the men’s doubles before Ea and Angela Yu gave Australia the victory when they crushed Mahoor and Ghazala 21-11, 21-6 in the women’s doubles.
Mahoor had complained about Pakistan’s lack of options during an interview with the Press Trust of India news agency following their loss to India.
“The other teams have eight players,” said Mahoor. “Here, four of us have to play all the games. I am a singles player but had to play in doubles and mixed doubles as well. It becomes difficult to focus on one.”

UGANDA’S Victor Kiplangat reacts after winning gold medal in the men’s marathon at the Commonwealth Games.—Reuters

 
BIRMINGHAM: Victor Kiplangat took a wrong turn about a mile from the finish line but still managed to give Uganda their first-ever Commonwealth Games marathon gold in Birmingham on Saturday.
The 22-year-old barely put a foot wrong until his moment of confusion but he regathered himself and timed 2hr 10min 55sec, coming home with a broad grin on his face.
“The people riding the motorcycles were confusing me,” he said.  “They told me to turn back. But I still made it to the finish.”
There were no such navigational problems for Australia’s Jessica Stenson, who turned two successive bronze medals into gold in the women’s race.
Despite his wrong turn, Kiplangat finished more than a minute and a half clear of Tanzania’s 2017 world bronze medallist Alphonce Simbu.
But for that slight detour he might have broken the long-standing Games record set by England’s Ian Thompson (2:09.12), set in Christchurch in 1974.
“I believed when I reached 35 kilometres that I had some hope [of beating it],” he said, adding that making history for his country was ample consolation.
“I believe Uganda is proud of me today. We have been waiting for this.”
Kiplangat, who was not selected in Uganda’s team for the recent world championships in Eugene, Oregon, was gushing with confidence after his win.
“I believe I shall be a great man like [Uganda’s] Joshua Cheptegei and [Kenya’s Eliud] Kipchoge,” he said.
Cheptegei is the Olympic 5,000m champion and two-time winner of the world 10,000m title while Kipchoge is a double Olympic champion in the marathon.
“We shall keep breaking records,” he said.  “As long as we are healthy, everything is possible. I’m still young and still growing. I believe I can be even better.”
Kenya’s Michael Githae took the bronze medal, more than two minutes behind the winner.
For Githae — winner of the last-ever Fukuoka Marathon in December last year — the joy was even greater as he had been called up late to the team.
“I was still mentally prepared despite the late call-up,” he said.  “I faced many challenges up and down. It was a very tough course.
“This is one of the best achievements of my career.”
Long-time pacesetter Liam Adams of Australia made a valiant effort at trying to give his country their third successive win in the event but had to settle for fourth.
In the women’s race, 34-year-old Stenson timed 2:27.31, finishing 29 seconds clear of Margaret Mariuki of Kenya.
Defending champion Helalia Johannes of Namibia produced a remarkable run at 41 to take the bronze.
Stenson whipped off her dark glasses with two kilometres to go as she powered to victory. Victory was all the sweeter for the Australian as she had contracted Covid-19 less than a month before the Games.

2,Afraz earns Pakistan last-gasp draw against South Africa,"After Sunday's match against New Zealand, Pakistan face Scotland on Aug 3 before clashing against Australia on Aug 4.","BIRMINGHAM: Afraz scored with 20 seconds left on the clock to help Pakistan secure a 2-2 draw against South Africa in their opening match of the Commonwealth Games hockey tournament on Saturday. 
Pakistan twice came from behind in their Pool ‘A’ game and the performance left captain Umar Bhutta feeling optimistic about the team’s chances of finishing in the top two and advancing into the semi-finals. 
“We played a very good game today,” Umar told reporters after the match. “We will try our best to win the next match against New Zealand and make it to the semifinals.” 
After the match against New Zealand on Sunday, Pakistan face Scotland on Aug 3 before clashing against six-time champions Australia on Aug 4.
“We will try not to repeat the same mistakes in our next matches,” Pakistan’s Dutch coach Siegfried Aikman told reporters. 
In an entertaining first quarter, both Pakistan and South Africa started aggressively but it was the South Africans who took the lead in the 14th minute when Connor Beauc­hamp converted a penalty corner. 
Pakistan levelled matters on their first penalty corner through Rizwan Ali in the 25th minute and it prompted South Africa to immediately create a circle entry but they lacked the cutting edge to maximise the opportunity. 
South Africa grew in confidence and had more shots, circle entries and penalty corners but Pakistan’s defensive unit managed to thwart their moves. 
As the third quarter came, the teams got wasteful in possession and Pakistan failed to convert their second penalty corner while also missing a close chance. 
They were made to rue those misses when South Africa got a penalty stroke when an absolute rocket of a penalty corner from Guise-Brown struck the face mask of the Pakistan defender Mubashar Ali on the line. Guise-Brown took the stroke to make it 2-1 with six minutes remaining on the clock. 
Pakistan needed to respond and they duly did when they got a penalty corner in the dying moments from which Afraz found the back of the net.
In the other Pool ‘A’ match on Saturday, New Zealand and Scotland drew 5-5.

3,Nazeerullah falls to Williams,Lewis Williams was dominant throughout all three rounds.,"BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan boxer Nazeerullah was no match for home hope Lewis Williams as he fell in the round-of-16 of the heavyweight competition at the Commonwealth Games on Saturday.
Williams was dominant throughout all three rounds as the Leamington boxer progressed to a quarter-final clash with Papau New Guinea’s Arthur Lavalou via unanimous points decision.
“Usually there’s some nerves,” Williams said after the bout. 
“I’ve got my home crowd here for a change. I didn’t feel that as a pressure, I felt that as a bonus. It was a big push.
“It’s quality to have my family and friends here. In the local parks they have got screens with people watching. 
“Everybody is supporting, everybody is watching, my phone is blowing up with people sending messages supporting me. It’s just a bonus, isn’t it? I’m just feeling a push, it’s not pressure, it’s just motivation.”

Samed’s A sample was found to contain the banned diuretic and masking agent Furosemide, the Commonwealth Games Federation said in a statement.
“He has therefore been suspended with immediate effect,” the statement said.
“He will now have the opportunity to provide further information, including requesting analysis of his B sample, before any charge is issued.”
Samed could not be reached for comment and the Ghana Boxing Federation did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The light-heavyweight boxer was scheduled to face Luc Jean Rosalba on Friday but did not show up for the weigh in.
Samed, who competed at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, is the first athlete to fail a drug test at the Birmingham Games, which began on Friday.

None of four representatives from the country, including Bismah, had progressed from their respective heats on Friday and Pakistan will now look forward to other events with Bismah competing in the heats of the 50m butterfly on Sunday. Bismah clocked 27.82 seconds on Saturday, finishing 38th among a field of 58. She missed the semi-finals by 1.81 seconds.
On Friday, Bismah had said that she had been nervous when competing in the heats of the 100m butterfly.
“We’re [Pakistan swimmers] not that bad,” she had told reporters. “It’s just that for us swimmers in Pakistan, we don’t get the opportunity of competing at the highest level more often.”

Having elected to bowl, Bismah Maroof’s side restricted Barbados to 144-4 but faltered early on in the chase, being reduced to 49-4 in the 11th over. 
After Iram Javed (first-ball duck), Muneeba Ali (17), Omaima Sohail (10) and Bismah Maroof (12) were back in the pavilion, Nida kept Pakistan in the run-chase and brought them close. 
Nida and Aliya Riaz (24) collected 20 runs from Shamilia Connell’s final over and 15thover of the innings. It included three fours and a huge six from Nidas bat.  
The duo went on to collect 11 runs in the 17thover with 39 runs required from the last three overs. 
The pair scored eight runs from the 18thover but their 69-run partnership with Aliya was broken in the next over when Aaliyah Alleyne had Aliya caught by Connell at mid-off. 
With 27 runs required off the final over, Pakistan managed to score 11 runs with Ayesha Naseem striking a six off the second ball of the over. 
Nida brought up her half-century in the final over — her 31-ball innings including seven boundaries and one six. 
Earlier, Pakistan got an early breakthrough when Deandra Dottin was caught by Bismah off Diana Baig in the first over. 
But that was as good as it got for Pakistan as captain Hayley Matthews and Kycia Knight tore into the attack to amass 107 runs for the second wicket. 
Matthews scored a 50-ball 51, hitting four fours and one six while Knight returned undefeated on 62 off 56 balls, which included nine boundaries. 
For Pakistan, right-arm fast Fatima Sana was the most successful bowler with 2-41 from four overs. 
Pakistan will next face arch-rivals India, who are also smarting from an opening game defeat against Australia, on Sunday.

7,Australia off to a flyer as swim stars shine at Commonwealth Games,BIRMINGHAM: Austra­lia dominated the first night of action in the Common­wealth Games pool in Birmi­ngham on...,"BIRMINGHAM: Austra­lia dominated the first night of action in the Common­wealth Games pool in Birmi­ngham on Friday to race clear at the top of medals table.
Olympic champions Ariarne Titmus and Zac Stubblety-Cook showed their class in tight races while world champ­ion Elijah Winnington powered home in style.
Australia finished their evening on cloud nine by winning the mixed 4x100m freestyle relay, with Emma McKeon collecting the ninth Common­wealth gold of her career.
They won eight medals out of a possible 16 on day one of sporting action at the Games — five clear of second-placed New Zealand.
Titmus, who won 200m and 400m freestyle gold at last year’s Tokyo Olympics, was given a mighty scare in the women’s 200m freestyle at the Sandwell Aquatics Centre by 18-year-old compatriot Mollie O’Callaghan.
The double Olympic champion was in control for most of the race but was hunted down the final stretch, edging home by just 0.12sec in a new Games record of 1min 53.89sec.
“Moll has been killing in training, she is young, feisty, hungry — I knew she would be there,” Titmus told Australia’s Channel 7.  “It is fun to have a race.”  “I love it that we are in a country where we have depth like this,” added the 21-year-old, who recently had a bout of coronavirus.
Winnington stormed to victory in the men’s 400m freestyle as Australia swept the podium just weeks after winning the world title in Budapest.
The 22-year-old, who was inside world record pace for much of the race, tired in the latter stages, clocking 3:43.06.
Winnington, who almost quit the sport after a poor Olympics last year, said he was not too disappointed that he had faded in the final stages to miss out on a shot at the world record.
“It’s something to chase,” he said.  “My coach and I always say it’s pretty hard being the hunted but having that world record there means I am still the hunter.” 
Olympic and world men’s 200m brea­ststroke champion Stubblety-Cook was put under immense pressure by Eng­land’s defending champion James Wilby but powered down the home straight to win in 2:08.07.
Canada’s Summer McIntosh, just 15 years old, destroyed the field in the women’s 400m individual medley.
She recorded a new Games record of 4:29.01 — more than three seconds quicker than her winning time at the recent world championships.
Breaking her own world junior record, she finished nearly eight seconds clear of second-placed Australian Kiah Melverton.
“I’ve been working on a lot of stuff in training so I can execute my 400m IM better than I did at the worlds, because I had so much room for impro­vement — and I still do,” she said.
In the cycling events, taking place in London, Australia won the women’s 4,000 metres team pursuit and New Zealand won the men’s event.
Much of the focus was on England’s Laura Kenny, who took an emotional bronze medal in the women’s race.
The 30-year-old has endured a torrid time since last year’s Covid-delayed Tokyo Olympics, suffering a miscarriage and an ectopic pregnancy. “I’ve never felt so much pressure to try to win a bro­nze in my whole career,” Kenny said.
New Zealand also won the women’s team sprint. 
England became the first team to win three successive Commonwealth Games team gymnastics golds with victory for the men.

Fresh from a 3-0 sweep of a One-day International series at the Queen’s Park Oval, the tourists were at their most dominant in posting a formidable 190 for six batting before easily restricting the home side to 122 for eight in reply.
Captain Rohit Sharma, one of a handful of first-choice players rested from the ODI matches, laid the foundation for his team’s total with a top-score of 64 off 44 balls with seven fours and two sixes highlighting the opener’s composed effort.
Dinesh Karthik then gave the innings important late impetus with an unbeaten 41 off just 19 balls, his unbroken seventh-wicket stand of 52 with Ravichan­dran Ashwin in the last four overs seeming to drain the West Indies’ enthusiasm in the sweltering midday heat.
Karthik’s contribution earned him the man-of-the-match award.
“The way we finished off the innings was great because we needed to hang in there and get more than just a par score,” said Sharma after the match 
in paying tribute to Karthik’s late surge.
“We also want keep on trying different things at various stages of the innings to improve our overall game.”
Pacer Alzarri Joseph claimed two expensive wickets but Akeal Hosein was by far the pick of the Caribbean bowlers.
He conceded just 14 runs across his four overs in which he claimed the first wicket of the match when Suryakumar Yadav was bowled after dominating an opening stand of 44 with Sharma.
A similarly rampaging start to the West Indies’ chase by Kyle Mayers and Shamarh Brooks — they belted 22 runs off the first eight balls of the innings — proved deceptive as seamer Arshdeep Singh dismissed Mayers for one of his two wickets.
Spinners Ashwin and Ravi Bishnoi also had too much guile in picking up two wickets each against a West Indies batting line-up which struggled to build any sort of momentum.
Brooks’s 20 was the best effort of a mediocre batting performance, leaving West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran to contemplate on yet another implosion by his team, two days after being thrashed by 119 runs in the last match of the ODI series.
“We were not disciplined, and paid the price. The guys know that,” said Pooran.
“We lost wickets every time we had momentum and that cost us.”

Punters meanwhile suffered as four favourites bit the dust in a five-race card.
New Market and Take Care fought neck-and-neck before the former managed to beat the latter to return to winning ways after June 5. Owned by S.M.Razi and Nadim Ahmed with rider Sohail Ahmed in the saddle, New Market returned home in 0.512/5 seconds in the four-furlong contest. The victorious horse was partnered by trainer Mohammad Usman Sadiq.
Mare Little Darling grabbed third place falling three lengths behind while bay horse Daffodles Wave completed the frame another length-and-three-quarters away.
Faster Than You was scratched in the morning declaration leaving 10 horses in fray.
Chestnut horse Faris, who was relegated to second place after completing a hat-trick, atoned to his last def­eat, lowering the colours of favourite bay horse Shahbaz to win the day’s feature event. He was home by a length in the four-and-a-half furlongs race clocking 0.572/5 seconds.
Bay horse Geo Jalal who had won his last race, occupied third slot beaten by four lengths and was followed by bay colt Torrent by another five-and-a-half lengths among five contestants.
Royal Duke, another rank outsider gelding, coasted to victory over public fancied chestnut horse Marvellous by short head verdict in a thrilling fashion to win the fourth and supporting race. 
He clocked 0.581/5 seconds for the race run over four-and-a-half furlongs.
This is Royal Duke’s maiden victory in three outings.
Mares Balochistan Queen and Zahrish followed the top two in the same order, respectively.
Bay horse The Duke won the opening race imposing to two lengths-and-a-quarter victory over bay horse Arkedian while mare Stella overcame bay horse Epsom by neck in a photo finish to land the second race.
Meanwhile, the next Gymkhana race meeting will be held on Aug 14 which will feature the Independence Day Cup.

The Monsoon Cup, a Class VII Division VI to be contested over 900  metres, contains seven runners. None of them has ever won a race and  only two bay colts — Paras Love and Rana Gee — have been placed in  their four outings each to make them probable contenders for the  honours. This will be the second race of the order.
The main supporting event, the Kaghan Plate Class VII Division I (Class VI included), will be contested over 1,000 metres. Of the seven runners listed for the event, Chestnut Surkhab, who registered an easy success last Sunday, will be going all out to make it two in a row. Nay Silent Assassin, who finished second in the same race, has an advantage in the handicap figures but Surkhab is the fastest and could only be defeated by bay colt Market Leader who will be running after a long absence of over three months. This will be the day’s fourth race.
Though there are nine runners in the opener but the quartet of Umer Princess,  Soldier Queen, Noman The Great and Zoaq-e-Yaqeen look the real contenders in the same order.
The third race, the Kaghan Plate Class VII Division IV and V to be contested over 900 metres, has nine runners which looks an open affair as around half-a-dozen of them have a chance. 
Bay colt Chhota Bravo, who was beaten in his previous outing, is likely to oblige his owner with a comfortable win in the fifth and last race, the Kaghan Plate Class VII Division II and III to be gone over 1,000 metres. 
The first race starts at 6:00pm.

Zimbabwe posted 205-3 and restricted the tourists to 188-6 to take the lead in a series that continues on Sunday at the same venue and concludes on Tuesday.
It was the sixth consecutive victory by Zimbabwe since former batting star Dave Houghton began a second stint as national coach in June and a 13th loss in the last 14 T20 Internationals for Bangladesh.
Pakistan-born Raza, often the most prolific Zimbabwe run getter, smashed an unbeaten 65 off 26 balls after coming in at number five, including four sixes and seven fours.
Madhevere was close to bettering his career-best T20 score of 73 when forced to retire injured midway through the final over having contributed 67 runs.
More cautious than Raza, his 46-ball innings included nine fours and he shared increasingly fruitful partnerships with captain Craig Ervine, Sean Williams and Raza.
Bangladesh, lacking several key figures, struggled with their bowling and fielding, and were always behind the Zimbabwe run-rate of 10.25 as they chased victory.
Wicket-keeper and stand-in skipper Nurul Hasan top scored with 42 off 26 deliveries, hitting four sixes and a four.
Najmul Hossain Shanto was the other batsman to cause Zimbabwe some trouble, with his 37 including a six and three fours.
Luke Jongwe, with 2-34 in four overs, was the pick of the Zimba­bwe bowlers at Harare Sports Club.
Zimbabwe began the series in a confident mood having won all five matches as hosts this month in a qualifying tournament for the T20 World Cup in Australia during October-November.
Bangladesh were weakened by the absence of Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah Riyad, Mushfiqur Rahim and the retired Tamim Iqbal.

The hosts took the lead three times in the first half after Leverkusen had twice pulled level.
Elversberg, newly promoted to the third division, refused to give up and bagged a fourth with Kevin Conrad’s 74th minute header.
Leverkusen, who had been wasteful up front especially in the first half and with big gaps at the back, only managed to pull a goal back through Patrik Schick in the 89th.
They failed to get past the first round of the competition for the first time in 11 years and they will need to raise their game next week when they face Borussia Dortmund in their Bundesliga opener.
Dortmund booked their German Cup second round ticket on Friday with a dominant 3-0 over third tier 1860 Munich.

The 24-year-old Briton clocked a best lap in one minute and 17.377 seconds to outpace Carlos Sainz in the leading Ferrari by 0.044 seconds. Charles Leclerc was third for Ferrari, one-tenth adrift.
Lando Norris grabbed fourth for McLaren ahead of the two Alpines of last year’s winner Esteban Ocon and two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who turned 41 on Friday.
Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton aborted his final flying lap in his Mercedes due to a Drag Reduction System (DRS) failure and qualified seventh ahead of former team-mate Valtteri Bottas of Alfa Romeo.
Daniel Ricciardo of McLaren was ninth and Red Bull’s series leader and world champion Verstappen 10th after suffering power failure problems and failing to record a competitive lap time.
Russell’s first pole in his 73rd Grand Prix was also Mercedes’s first since last year’s Saudi Arabian Grand Prix and signalled that the team may finally have overcome their struggles with the new ‘ground effect’ aerodynamic regulations this season.
“Incredible! Amazing. You did it,” screamed Russell on his team radio.  “You beauty. No points for Saturday, boys... Let’s go tomorrow.”
Back in the pitlane, as the big crowd gave him generous cheers, he said he was  “over the moon” and  “buzzing - and yesterday was our worst Friday of the season... It’s mega. An incredible feeling.”
Sainz was quick to congratulate him.  “George must have produced a pretty good lap,” he said while Leclerc took consolation from knowing Verstappen would start 10th while he was third on the grid.
Russell added:  “Everyone last night was working so hard. We didn’t know what direction to go in. When I came across the line, and looked at the screen and saw P1, it was an incredible feeling.”
After a rain-hit final practice session earlier in the day, qualifying began in dry conditions with some sunshine — and every driver emerging quickly on soft tyres to take advantage of the improved weather.
After early fastest laps from Magnussen, Stroll and Hami­lton, Verstappen set the pace in a close scrap with the two Ferr­aris before Hamilton and Russell took over for Mercedes, taking advantage of warmer conditions after earlier struggles.
At the other end of the timings, Nicholas Latifi of Williams, who had been fastest on a drying circuit in final practice, was eliminated in P20 along with Alpha Tauri’s Pierre Gasly and luckless retirement-bound Sebastian Vettel of Aston Martin.
Vettel had crashed in the final minutes of the final practice and assisted his mechanics in repairing his car prior to Q1, but to no avail as he went out in P18.
“Not what I wanted,” he said.  “It’s been really nice [how everyone reacted to his retirement plans], but my head is in qualifying and we had a poor day. I can’t be happy.”
Yuki Tsunoda of Alpha Tauri also went out in 16th along with Alex Albon in the second Williams.
Although a large dark cloud loomed, the track remained dry for Q2 with Norris taking top spot early for McLaren, ahead of the fast Ferraris before Verstappen gained the initiative with the first lap inside 1m 18secs and stayed there.
Keen improvements by both Alpines and Alfa Romeos left Russell and Hamilton on the cusp of missing the top ten after their first run, but the multiple champion improved to third on his second.
Perez struggled again in the second Red Bull, had a lap disallowed, but reinstated before exiting in P11, complaining he was blocked by Magnussen.
Out with the Mexican went Zhou Guanyu of Alfa Romeo, Magnussen and his Haas team-mate Mick Schumacher along with Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll.
Only 0.065 seconds had separated Verstappen and Leclerc at the top, creating the prospect of a thrilling duel for pole.
But it was Sainz who set the pace, ahead of Russell, on the opening runs when Leclerc was third and Verstappen back in seventh, ahead of the closing drama.
“I have no power,” said Verstappen, on his out-lap.
“Ok, stand by,” replied his Red Bull team.
A further exchange ended with the driver saying  “nothing works” as Leclerc and then Sainz went fastest before Russell’s late intervention.
