1,Lakki villagers protest police action during kabaddi match,Say there was no justification to raid the playground and disrupt the game.,"LAKKI MARWAT: Hundreds of villagers on Saturday closed the Tajazai-Darra Tang Road in Lakki city to protest against the police for disrupting a sports event in Mela Shahabkhel village.
Residents of Mela Shahabkhel, Langerkhel and other villages marched to Qazi Ishfaq Chowk and staged a sit-in there.
Village council chairman Naimatullah Khan, former nazim Umar Jan and Asif Iqbal Advocate led the procession.
Despite rain, the protesters continued agitation and kept the road closed for five hours, causing long queues of vehicles.
The protesters alleged the police disrupted a kabaddi match on Friday by resorting to firing in the air to disperse game lovers and arrested the event organisers.
They condemned the brazen action and said there was no justification to raid the playground and disrupt the game.
“Mela Shahabkhel village has a good reputation with regard to organising sports events, especially kabaddi matches, but unjustified action by the police badly tarnished it,” Asif Iqbal Advocate deplored.
The protesters asked the police high-ups to remove the Lakki Marwat police station SHO and register a case against cops for firing during the kabaddi match. They also demanded release of the arrested people.
Former district nazim Ishfaq Ahmad Khan, MPA Munawar Khan’s brother Eng Amir Nawaz Khan and ANP district vice-president Hamayun Marwat also turned up to express solidarity with the protesters. The protesters dispersed after talks with the police.
District police officer Ziauddin Ahmad told Dawn that the police were not against the promotion of games, but after receiving credible information that proclaimed offenders and armed men would come to the venue, cops were sent to the locality to convince organisers to wind up the activity for safety of villagers. He said the police had also received a threat alert of a subversive act by miscreants.
“The organisers offered resistance and some people also hooted at the police and pelted stones on cops, leaving them with no option but to resort to firing in the air,” he maintained. He said the local administration had also not permitted the event.
Mr Zia said sports event was in violation of restrictions imposed by the administration as part of measures to maintain peace during Muharram.

3,Court verdicts in favour of a particular party to have consequences for country: Fazl,JUI-F chief says parties ruling centre to contest by-polls together.,"PESHAWAR: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said here on Saturday that an act of a judge protecting a particular party through judicial decisions would have far-reaching consequences for the country. 
Speaking at a ceremony arranged for welcoming PPP leader Fakhar Azam from Bannu into the JUI-F fold at his party’s provincial headquarters, he said they respected the judiciary as an institution. 
Mr Fazl said that when a judge became controversial and assumed upon himself to protect a party by using his court judgment then such decisions would have far-reaching consequences. 
“Do not look at the quick results when you provide relief to a party immediately, as in the long run such decisions destroy countries,” he said. 

JUI-F chief says parties ruling centre to contest by-polls together

The JUI-F chief said that as an institution they had no issue with the judiciary, but the question arose why the same three judges would hear cases about Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Imran Khan as if they were not judges, but PTI workers. 
He said some individuals from within used their institutions to forge cases against the JUI-F leaders. 
Mr Fazl said those lecturing them about independence were themselves progeny of slaves of British Raj. He said PTI chief Imran Khan himself campaigned for a conservative friend of Israel, who was contesting elections against a Pakistani-origin British national in the run for the London mayor. 
He also alleged that the US Consulate kept paying rent of the PTI chief’s house for about nine years. He said at least 15 members of Imran Khan’s cabinet were US and European nationals and yet he was lecturing others about independence. 
In contrast to this, Mr Fazl said that his own elders had a history of 100 years long struggle against the British. 
He said they wanted to convey to the institutions they would not bow before anyone wielding powers. 
Referring to Imran Khan, he said all the political parties irrespective of their political orientations had joined hands to defeat the ‘anti-national element’ which had the foreign support and funding as well. 
The JUI-F chief said people from within the institutions were also backing them, adding that such people only came to the surface when they changed their uniform. 
He said the PDM and ruling allies would contest the coming by-elections like one party.“We need to save this country and its geography,” he said. 
He said that while PTI chief was preaching honesty to other politicians, a single person purchased the loyalties of the entire Azad Jammu and Kashmir Assembly members. 
The JUI-F chief said that the Constitution provided for the local government and its powers. However, he said that when the ruling party lost the local government polls in the province, it changed rules and snatched powers from the elected representatives. 
He said the LG representatives should take to streets against this power grab which was otherwise impossible through writs and courts. 
Referring to delay in loan tranche by IMF, he questioned why America despite being an ally was creating economic problems for Pakistan. 
He said the situation in which the country was pushed for past four years could not be corrected in four months. “We have been facing difficulties, but we are working to get out of this situation,” he said.

CM aide says move part of initiatives against corruption

“With the launch of computerised delivery services, corruption and ambiguities in land records will also come to an end,” he said.
The CM’s aide regretted that Hazara division’s Torghar, Upper and Lower Kohistan and Kolai-Palas district didn’t have land records. He said the government would regularise all community land in all those four districts.
Mr Tarand said in the second phase, land revenue records would be centralised with those seeking access to them could do so anywhere in the province.
Local MPA Babar Saleem Swati said the PTI government was taking tangible steps to do away with corruption in the province.
BRIDGE TO BE REBUILT: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf divisional coordinator in Hazara, Salah Mohammad Khan, on Saturday said the government would shortly rebuild a bridge swept away by flash floods in Baffa area.
“The bridge which was swept away in the flash floods at Siren River marooned the population of many towns and villages and I would take this issue with the Chief Minister for its early reconstruction,” he told reporters here on Saturday.
The PTI leader said Rs450 million was required to reconstruct that bridge and it was likely to be released after approval by the chief minister.
He said a survey was being carried out by the government to assess damage caused by flash floods and landslides in the province.

Official sources told this correspondent that the authorities opened the spillways on Wednesday afternoon following a go-ahead from the Indus River System Authority (IRSA). 
“Since safety of the dam’s structure is of paramount importance, the dam authorities obtained IRSA’s approval and have started operating the spillways from Wednesday for flushing out certain amount of water regularly so that pressure on the structure could be avoided to the maximum by creating space for fresh inflows following torrential rains in the northern areas and upper Hazara,” said Tarbela Dam public relations officer Javed Iqbal while talking to this scribe. 
He said that small to heavy inflows were expected to continue entering Tarbela reservoiroff and ontill Sept 10 and as such the dam authorities had opened the auxiliary spillways to spill out water keeping in view the inflows. 
He said that with increased inflow the spillways were expected to remain in operation for the next couple of days. 
The official said that the inflow recorded on Saturday evening was 325,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) and outflow 262,100 cfs. The water level was recorded at 1,524ft, which was about 26ft short of the reservoir’s maximumconservation level of 1,550ft.

10,"Health dept issues guidelines to prevent diarrhoea, cholera outbreak",Province has recorded high incidence of two diseases...,"PESHAWAR: The health department has issued guidelines to the administrations of all districts on how to prevent the outbreak of acute watery diarrhoea and cholera during the ongoing monsoon season.
According to officials, the country has recorded 129 confirmed cases of cholera this year. Of them, 25 are reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The diarrhoea cases total over 500,000 and 10,000 of them are of acute watery diarrhoea.
The health department sent those guidelines to the district health officers, local governments, water, food and sanitation departments saying cholera is a bacterial illness caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacteria Vibrio cholera. A multifaceted and  approach comprising surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and timely treatment is required to prevent and control it.

Province has recorded high incidence of two diseases

The department said regular monitoring of hygiene and cleanliness standards of hotels, restaurants and food points, ice factories, street vendors and water reservoirs was important to control its spread through regular liaison among relevant departments.
It asked for the building of hospital capacity to manage patients as well as the stockpiling of essential medicine kits at healthcare facilities with a focus on health education campaign through active community participation particularly aiming vulnerable populations. It asked the authorities to ensure chlorination of water as well.
The officials said currently, cholera clustering was reported in children under four years of age in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces.
They said the number of cholera cases had gradually increased since February but no death from it was reported.
The officials said symptoms of the disease ranged from mild to severe and included profuse watery diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Diarrhoea ranges from mild to severe; which can cause severe dehydration and death within hours of onset if not treated timely.
They said cholera transmission was closely linked to inadequate access to clean water and sanitation facilities, while poor and congested localities were at greater risk of having epidemics as the pipes supplying clean treated water were usually old, rusted and damaged and sewage pipes and open sewage lanes were running side by side.
The officials said if all those conditions were not checked, water­-borne diseases would break out.
They said hot and humid weather made condition favourable for the multiplication of micro-organisms.
The officials said cholera was transmitted by the fecal-oral route and patients got symptomatic after ingesting contaminated food or water, while typical at-risk areas included peri-urban slums, and camps for internally displaced persons or refugees, where minimum requirements of clean water and sanitation were not being met, could increase the risk of cholera transmission.
They said to control such epidemics, scale of public awareness should be raised regarding the significance of washing hands with soap and water regularly, especially after using toilet, changing diapers and before preparing food or eating, take safe drinking water boiled or chlorinated or bottled water and avoid eating  uncooked vegetables and unwashed fruit and prefer taking home made fresh meals.
The officials said the department organised training sessions for healthcare providers regarding management of acute watery diarrhoea and cholera cases.
They said all acute watery diarrhoea cases weren’t cholera and instead, only a few tested positive for the disease.
The officials said the areas, where people consumed spring or river water, had high incidence of acute watery diarrhoea, so the sinking of tube wells and chlorination of water were required.
They said there was a designated unit of integrated disease surveillance and response at directorate-general health services, whereas the district disease surveillance and response units had been established to report cases of communicable diseases, including acute watery diarrhoea.
The officials said during monsoon season, the number of acute watery diarrhoeaoutbreaks increased and every outbreak was responded with preventive, curative and health education intervention.

However, the tribunal consisting of chairman retired Justice Nisar Hussain, Mohammad Bashir and Zafar Iqbal Khan allowed the complex’s administration to continue with the process for recruitment.
The tribunal fixed Sept 1 for next hearing into an appeal jointly filed by MPA Ikhtiar Wali and job candidate Mohammad Irfan against two advertisements issued a few days ago for recruitment againstseveral posts of BPS-5-BPS-20 in the Qazi Hussain Ahmad Medical Complex (QHAMC) and Nowshera Medical College (NMC).
After preliminary hearing, the tribunal issued notices to the respondents, including the provincial health secretary, the QHAMC hospital director, the MTI board of governors through its chairman, and others directing them to respond to the appeal on next hearing.
It also observed that it would first resolve the question of maintainability of the appeal as to whether the matter agitated was amenable to the appellate jurisdiction of this tribunal or in a writ petition before the high court.
The appellants requested the tribunal to declare those advertisements and appointment process illegal.
They gave multiple grounds for the acceptance of their appeal and said approval was not obtained from the QHAMC’s board of governors for issuing advertisements and making recruitment against several posts.
Advocate Shah Faisal Ilyas appeared for the appellants and said the health department, through a letter on Jan 24, 2020, had directed the respondents, including the relevant hospital director and dean of the NMC, to stop all types of recruitment in the QHAMC.
He said in violation of those directions, the respondents had advertised posts of numerous disciplines and that in order to carry out that recruitment, they had also sent a letter to the health secretary on July 14, 2022, for lifting that ban.
The lawyer, however, said the health secretary had not given any positive response to them.
He said one of the advertisements was issued on June 26, 2022 by acting hospital director of QHAMC Dr Anwar Khan, who was also the dean of NMC, for appointment on regular basis against different posts in BPS-5 to BPS-18.
The lawyer said a few days later, another advertisement was issued by the NMC’s dean for recruitment against different posts in BPS-5 to BPS-20.
He contended that the impugned advertisements were illegal and a violation of the judgement of the Supreme Court as the advertisements didn’t have any mention of the number of posts and approved criteria of each category.
Mr Shah Faisal contended that a respondent was the acting dean of NMC and also acted as the hospital director and therefore, he had no authority to make appointments against all categories of posts on regular basis as well as against those of clinical cadre.
He said the Peshawar High Court had issued a stay order against all recruitment against posts of Class IV in the hospital, and to ‘hoodwink’ the court, the hospital’s administration had upgraded several posts of Class IV to BPS-5.
When the tribunal asked how a sitting MPA could be an appellant and question the appointments, the counsel said being the elected member from his constituency, the lawmaker was under legal obligation to safeguard the interest of the locals, whereas the second appellant was a candidate for advertised posts.
