0,Bragging rights on line as Indo-Pak rivalry set to resume in Asia Cup,Cricket giants India and Pakistan could square up three times during the two weeks of the T20 competition in the United Arab Emirates.,"DUBAI: India’s Virat Kohli has the chance to find form before the World Cup while Babar Azam will look to keep Pakistan’s psychological edge when the rival countries clash as the headline acts of the Asia Cup starting this weekend. 
Cricket giants India and Pakistan could square up three times during the two weeks of the T20 competition in the United Arab Emirates. 
The six-nation tournament was moved from Sri Lanka because of political unrest and it takes on extra significance this year because the T20 World Cup in Australia is coming up fast, in October and November. 
Sri Lanka meet Afghanistan in Saturday’s opening match but all eyes will be on India and Pakistan, who clash in Dubai on Sunday. 
India will be looking to avenge their 10-wicket humiliation by Pakistan at the same venue in last year’s T20 World Cup. 
India head coach Rahul Dravid has Covid and India late on Wednesday appointed former batsman V.V.S. Laxman to take charge in an interim capacity. 
The match will be Kohli’s 100th T20 international and a chance for the batting great to emerge from his prolonged slump before the World Cup. 
The 33-year-old has not scored a century in any format since 2019 but should be refreshed after being rested for tours of the West Indies and Zimbabwe. 
Kohli, who has 27 centuries in 102 Tests, was replaced by Rohit as all-format skipper earlier this year. 
Pakistan’s fortunes will mainly depend on in-form skipper Babar, fresh from two big half-centuries in his team’s 3-0 ODI sweep of the Netherlands. 
Babar, 27, tops the world T20 and ODI batting rankings and led his team to victory last year against India with an unbeaten 68. 
Pakistan have brought in pace bowler Mohammad Hasnain in place of Shaheen Shah Afridi, India’s T20 destroyer last year, who has been forced out by a knee injury. 
India vice-captain K.L. Rahul said his team was looking forward to playing Pakistan with the arch-rivals only meeting each other in multi-nation events due to political issues between them. 
The neighbours have not played a Test since 2007, instead facing off only in the shorter versions of the game and at multi-team competitions on foreign soil, rather than head-to-head series at home. 
“We are all very excited. As players we always look forward to this India-Pak clash as we don’t play each other anywhere else but these big tournaments,” Rahul told reporters on Friday. 
“As we’ve seen there is a huge history, there has always been rivalry and the games have always been high intensity. As players we have always dreamt of playing India-Pakistan and it’s a great opportunity for all of us to challenge ourselves.” 
Matches ignite great fervour but they have also defused military tensions between the two nations, which have fought four wars since independence from Britain in 1947. 
Recently pictures and videos of Babar and Kohli meeting on the sidelines of a practice session in Dubai went viral. 
“We can’t run away from the rivalry and emotion that comes through as a player,” Rahul said. “After the game or before, everything goes away you become normal people, learn from each other, share experiences, it’s always been friendly.” 
Defending champions India, who won the last Asia Cup in 2018 when it was played over 50 overs, and Pakistan will be joined in Group ‘A’ by Hong Kong who defeated the UAE in the final qualifier on Wednesday. 
Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are in Group ‘B’. 
The top two teams from each group progress to a Super 4 stage, which could witness another contest between India and Pakistan. 
The great rivals could then meet for a third time should they both reach the September 11 final. 
Sri Lanka, led by Dasun Shanaka, could be the India-Pakistan party-poopers. 
They have a shown a lot of promise under new head coach Chris Silverwood and are capable of reaching the final, having enjoyed success in recent home series against a backdrop of a dire economic crisis. 
Victory would bring some welcome cheer to the cricket-crazy island nation ravaged in recent months by food and fuel shortages and rolling blackouts. 
Afghanistan, under the leadership of the seasoned Mohmmad Nabi, will be looking to beat the higher-ranked teams, something they were unable to in the T20 World Cup here last year. 
They have the ability to upset any side, their ace being leg-spinner Rashid Khan, one of the world’s leading T20 bowlers who can exploit and turn in the subcontinent-like UAE pitches. 
Bangladesh have been boosted by the return of all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan to lead the team, who said his priority was to see an improvement in performances of the struggling side with the World Cup fast approaching. 
Though the conditions in the UAE will be different from what teams will be experiencing in the World Cup in Australia, all the competing sides will be looking to identify their final squad for the ICC event over the course of the next two weeks.

The six-nation Twenty20 tournament will begin in the United Arab Emirates on Saturday after being moved from Sri Lanka because of political unrest.
Sri Lanka will take on Afghanistan in the tournament opener, which will serve as a tune-up for the T20 World Cup in Australia in October and November.
“Cricket always brings a different kind of vibe to Sri Lankan people, winning is the most thrilling thing,” Shanaka told reporters.  “So we look forward to delivering for our country.” Sri Lanka has been hit in recent months by food and fuel shortages along with power blackouts, but enjoyed success in a home series in June when they beat Australia in One-day Internationals.
They also drew level in Tests with Australia and Pakistan.
Shanaka said playing at home would have been a definite advantage but added that there are no favourites in the T20 format.
“Hosting this tournament in Sri Lanka would have favoured us more because the crowd support is there and playing in home conditions has a bigger advantage,” he said.
“When it comes to the favourites, India is a leading side at the moment but in T20 there are no favourites. On a day if we play good cricket, we can be the favourites as well.” Sri Lanka may play spoilers to a predicted India-Pakistan clash in the final of the tournament.
Leg-spinner Wanindu Hasaranga remained key for the side in the white-ball series against Australia at home and Shanaka said the team would rely on the all-rounder in the UAE.
“Our main spinner Wanindu Hasaranga will definitely play a major role in this tour for us,” said Shanaka.
“We have played some good series in the last two-three months. What I trust the most is the process, so we are on the right track and hopefully we can clean the series here as well.” Afghanistan, who come fresh from their white-ball sweep of Zimbabwe, have always run team’s hard in international competitions and created a few upsets as well but skipper Mohammad Nabi wants more consistency from his team.
“We have run out of steam in close games and this is what we thought about before coming here and God willing will try not to repeat our mistakes,” said Nabi.
“We came a week earlier for the Asia Cup to acclimatise and we will have a better tournament this time and try and move in the Super four stage.” Nabi insisted his team is not just about a few superstars such as Rashid Khan but is instead an all-performing unit.
Bangladesh is the third team in Group B. India, Pakistan and Hong Kong are clubbed in Group A.

Hasan was called back after fellow pacer Mohammad Wasim Jr was ruled out of the Asia Cup due to a side strain on Friday, an injury he picked up while bowling in Pakistan’s practice session a day earlier. Wasim had underwent an MRI scan after being assessed by the team’s medical staff. 
“The findings were discussed with the PCB Medical Advisory Committee, while an independent review by a specialist physiotherapist was also sought,” a Pakistan Cricket Board statement said, adding that Wasim’s return will be reassessed before Pakistan’s home Twenty20 International series against England. 
Hasan, meanwhile, was sought by the team management as Wasim’s replacement. The right-armers official inclusion in the squad, however is subject to the Asia Cup Event Technical Committee’s approval. 
“As soon as the ETC approves Hasan as a replacement player, the bowler will depart for the UAE,” said the PCB news release. 
Ahead of Pakistan’s three-match One-day International series against the Netherlands, skipper Babar Azam had advised Hasan to play domestic cricket to regain his place in the national side with the 28-year-old struggling for form since more than a year. The pacer’s T20I economy rate had risen above eight runs per over during the period. 
Wasim’s injury, which followed that of Pakistan’s pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi, may well see Hasan sharing the new ball with Naseem Shah or Haris Rauf when the national side open their Asia Cup campaign against arch-rivals India on Sunday.  
“Hasan Ali had been working on his bowling in the National High Performance Centre for the past three weeks and is presently in Rawalpindi, preparing for the National T20, which commences on 30 August,” added the PCB statement.

3,"Stokes, Foakes hit tons as England open up 264-run lead over SA","Foakes was a Test-best 113 not out when Stokes declared with England on 415-9, 264 runs ahead of South Africa’s meagre first-innings 151.","

MANCHESTER: England captain Ben Stokes cuts during his century in the second Test against South Africa at Old Trafford on Friday.—Reuters

 
MANCHESTER: Ben Stokes completed his first century since being appointed England’s permanent captain as he made 103 before wicket-keeper Ben Foakes reached three figures as well to strengthen the hosts’ grip on the second Test against South Africa at Old Trafford. 
Foakes was a Test-best 113 not out when Stokes declared with England on 415-9, 264 runs ahead of South Africa’s meagre first-innings 151. 
That left the Proteas facing a tricky nine-over session before the close of Friday’s second day. 
All-rounder Stokes, 98 not out at tea on Friday’s second day, went to three figures in unusual fashion when a straight drive off Kagiso Rabada deflected off the fast bowler’s shin to take him to a 158-ball hundred, including six fours and three sixes. 
But the left-handed batsman, dropped on 92, fell soon afterwards when a leading edge off Rabada flew high to mid-off where he was superbly caught by back-pedalling opposing captain Dean Elgar. 
England, however, were still well-placed at 320-6, a lead of 169 runs, following a stand of 173 between Stokes and Foakes, who was 68 not out at the time of his skipper’s dismissal. 
The pair had come together with England on 147-5 after South African quick bowler Anrich Nortje struck twice to remove both England’s overnight batsmen during an outstanding opening spell in the morning session. 
Jonny Bairstow fell one run short of his half century, with Nortje adding reverse swing to his top pace and the Yorkshireman edging to Sarel Erwee at first slip. 
Another fine delivery ended the solid contribution of 38 from under-scrutiny England opening batsman Zak Crawley, with Nortje’s perfect line inducing an edge to keeper Kyle Verreynne. 
But Stokes and Foakes then batted positively before lunch to begin building the lead. 
Their partnership was just what England, 1-0 down in this three-match series, required after an innings and 12-run defeat in the first Test at Lord’s -- their first defeat after a run of four successive wins under the leadership duo of Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum. 
And for all the talk of a new ‘Bazball’ aggressive style, the 31-year-old Stokes’s well-paced innings on Friday — his 12th hundred in 85 Tests and fourth against South Africa — was also a triumph of largely orthodox batting. 
Foakes then added to the Proteas’ woes by going to his second hundred in 16 Tests -- and first at home — when the 29-year-old Surrey gloveman late cut fast bowler Anrich Nortje for a ninth four in 206 balls faced. 
Tailenders Stuart Broad, Ollie Robinson and Jack Leach all chipped in before Stokes called a halt to the innings.

4,Australia not taking Zimbabwe lightly: Labuschagne,SYDNEY: Marnus Labuschagne said Australia would not be taking their opponents lightly when they kick off the new...,"SYDNEY: Marnus Labuschagne said Australia would not be taking their opponents lightly when they kick off the new international season with a One-day International against Zimbabwe in Townsville this weekend.
Sunday’s match is the first of three against the African side before the squad heads further north to face New Zealand in another three-match series in another tropical Queensland city, Cairns.
Australia have lost only two of 27 ODIs against Zimbabwe but one of those came in their last meeting in 2014, when a team featuring most of the players that won the World Cup the following year went down by three wickets in Harare. 
“I’m not too concerned about stats or stuff that happened in the past, our concern is that we prepare well,” batsman Labuschagne told reporters in Townsville on Friday. 
“Never underestimate your opposition, that’s one thing you realise about the game now, the game’s growing so fast and there’s so much exposure for people outside of international cricket. 
“With the amount of cricket there is, guys are improving rapidly and teams like Zimbabwe and Netherlands and Ireland, they are highly skilled teams now.”  
Labuschagne has played fewer ODIs than Tests for Australia, his 21 matches coming in two clumps with 13 in 2020 and the remainder this year. “It’s been quite scattered,” he added. 
“For me it’s just about getting consistent in my role, making sure I became that person batting at four or five who can finish the game off if that needs to be, or keep that run-rate going through the middle overs. 
“And hopefully, provide some overs with the ball.”  
Australia go into the Zimbabwe matches on the back of narrow series losses in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and Labuschagne said they were keen to make a statement in Townsville with the World Cup in India only 14 months away. 
“We’ve come here to win three out of three games,” he said. “We want to make sure our one-day cricket is flying leading up to the 2023 World Cup. That preparation starts now.”

After his six-year stint as assistant coach with the Australia men team ended last month, Sriram was appointed technical consultant of the Bangladesh Twenty20 side ahead of the team’s Asia Cup campaign in the United Arab Emirates.
Bangladesh head coach Russell Domingo is not accompanying the team to the UAE and speculation was rife that the South African would resign after being sidelined.
Domingo has quashed those “rumours” and said he was looking forward to helping the team improve in the other formats.
“I am very clear about my role here,” Sriram, who is part of Royal Challengers Bangalore’s coaching staff in the Indian Premier League (IPL), said in his first media interaction since taking up the job on Thursday.
“My job is to basically work with the captain, the team director and the skill coaches, bringing all three components together and use my T20 experience of IPL and Australia and bring a strategy where we can use our resources properly.”  
Sriram said it was a “fantastic move” to bring back star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan as the captain of the Twenty20 squad.
“I respected him as an opponent and it’s so heartening to see his view on the T20 game. It’s so modern, it was so refreshing, and we were on the same page.”  
Bangladesh begin their Group ‘B’ campaign against Afghanistan in Sharjah on Tuesday.

6,Maria named Pakistan captain for SAFF Women’s Championship,The tournament kicks off on Sept 6 and Maria’s international bow is set to come against India.,"KARACHI: It’s going to be some international debut for Maria Khan at the SAFF Women’s Championship next month. In her very first game donning Pakistan colours, she will also be wearing the captain’s armband. 
Maria was named captain of Pakistan’s first women’s football team in almost eight years when the Pakistan Football Federation Normalisation Committee announced its 23-member squad for the regional tournament in Nepal on Friday. 
The tournament kicks off on Sept 6 and Maria’s international bow is set to come against India the following day after FIFA on Friday lifted the suspension on the All India Football Federation.
However, Maria is not allowed to express what it means to her just yet. The PFF NC has apparently issued a strict gag order on the players and Maria didn’t disclose how she felt at being handed the responsibility of leading the team when asked for comment by Dawn. 
“As of right now I’m in competition mode and would politely defer you to the coaching staff for any immediate feedback,” she said in a written message. 
The PFF spokesperson told Dawn that the NC had a “policy in place on the coaches’ recommendation to prevent players from speaking to media personnel”. 
“However, for an immediate interview or quote, the NC can be contacted,” the spokesperson added. 
NC member Shahid Khokhar, who used to handle the media matters previously, told Dawn that “the players, especially the captain, would be made available soon and they had been kept away from the media to help them focus on their football”. 
There was no response from Khokhar on how interaction with the media shifts players’ focus away from game. In the news release sent by Khokhar announcing the squad, there was also no reaction from Maria. 
In what seems to be throwback to the policy that was prevalent during the time of the previous PFF setup where interview requests were routinely denied and players were sanctioned for speaking to the media, the moment was lost for UAE-based Maria to express on her journey to getting into the team and finally being named captain. 
Maria went from being goalkeeper in the United States to midfielder in the United Arab Emirates while also representing Wapda in the National Championships in 2018 and 2019 with her performances bringing her into national reckoning. 
But Pakistan football has been beset with institutional crisis in the PFF and forced FIFA to install a Normalisation Committee to settle the affairs of the federation. 
It has impacted women’s football most with the national team having last played in 2014. Only seven players from that squad remain in the current side, including vice-captain Malika-e-Noor and former captain and star striker Hajra Khan. 
The SAFF Women’s Championship will end that long drought and the PFF NC has also roped in UK-based midfielder Nadia Khan. 
Nadia, who plays for Doncaster Rovers Belles, is due to join the squad in Nepal. 
The NC had earlier appointed Adeel Rizki as the head coach for the team and he along with his assistant Walid Javed Khan had been holding a training camp for the team since the first week of August in Lahore. They had held trials previously to shortlist 35 players for the camp. 
Like Maria, Adeel too hasn’t been made available to the media and his announcement as head coach only came through a post on social media. 
The PFF NC has also not explained why Adeel, who holds a UEFA ‘B’ license but has never coached a team in either the men’s Pakistan Premier Football League or the National Women’s Championship, was appointed. 
The only reasoning the PFF NC has given is that it is making a “coaching panel and officials from it will be picked and appointed for national team assignments”. 
Squad: Alina Ispahani, Anmol Hira, Atiqa Nasir, Ghazala Amir, Hajra Khan, Khadija Kazmi, Maliha Nasir, Malika-e-Noor (vice-captain), Maria Khan (captain), Marvi Baig, Mishal Bhatti, Nadia Khan, Nisha Ashraf, Nizalia Siddiqui, Rameen Fareed, Roshnan Ali, Sahar Zaman, Sara Khan, Shani Shahida, Shanzay Nazir, Suha Hirani, Syeda Mahpara and Zulfia Nazir.

8,Marin vows to return to top after worlds exit,TOKYO: Spanish badminton star Carolina Marin vowed to get back to her dominant best after her bid for a record ...,"TOKYO: Spanish badminton star Carolina Marin vowed to get back to her dominant best after her bid for a record fourth world title was ended by Japan’s Akane Yamaguchi on Friday.
Marin is feeling her way back into competition after suffering a horror knee injury last year that forced her to miss the Tokyo Olympics and kept her out of action for a year.
She returned to the court in May this year but current world number one Yamaguchi was too strong in their world championships quarter-final in Tokyo, advancing with a 21-17, 21-17 win.
Marin said she “felt quite good” physically but “made many mistakes in my strategy” as Yamaguchi wore her down in front of an expectant home crowd.
The Spaniard said she would “keep looking forward” as she tries to recover the form that made her a three-time world champion and an Olympic gold medallist at the 2016 Rio Games. 
“I know that if I keep going, if I keep practising hard, I will get back to my best level,” said the 29-year-old, who also missed last year’s worlds in her home city of Huelva because of injury. 
Yamaguchi’s win meant all four top seeds advanced to the semi-finals of the women’s competition.
The Japanese ace will face South Korea’s An Se-young, who beat China’s Han Yue in a 21-14, 15-21, 22-20 thriller, while the other match between Chen Yufei and Tai Tzu-ying will be a re-run of last year’s Olympic final.
China’s Chen, who won gold last year in Tokyo, beat Canada’s Michelle Li 21-18, 21-17, while Taiwan’s Tai advanced with a 21-16, 21-9 win over Thailand’s Busanan Ongbamrungphan.
On the men’s side, Singapore’s defending champion Loh Kean Yew said he would try to “improve everything” after his reign ended with a 21-12, 17-21, 21-8 loss to Thailand’s Kunlavut Vitidsarn.
Number eight seed Loh said he struggled to cope with the drift inside Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium but vowed to return stronger. 
Rising star Vitidsarn will face China’s Zhao Junpeng in the semi-finals after the unseeded 26-year-old beat India’s H.S. Prannoy 19-21, 21-6, 21-18.
Zhao lost in the quarter-finals at last year’s world championships and he was happy to go one better this time around. 
Taiwanese number four seed Chou Tien-chen will face hot favourite Viktor Axelsen in the other semi-final after fighting off five match points to beat Indonesia’s Jonatan Christie 14-21, 21-11, 22-20.
Axelsen continued his run of winning every match in straight games with a dominant 21-10, 21-10 victory over Indonesia’s Anthony Sinisuka Ginting.

Already 3-0 up from last week’s first leg in London, West Ham secured victory with 30 million striker Gianluca Scamacca, Algerian international Said Benrahma and Czech star Tomas Soucek on target in Denmark.
The English side were barely threatened but goalkeeper Alphonse Areola had to be alert with a double save to keep out Jay-Roy Grot and Justin Lonwijk.
The Hammers will now turn their attentions to resuscitating their Premier League campaign. They are currently rock bottom of the table having lost all three of their opening games without scoring a goal.
Villarreal, who were Europa League champions in 2021, also made the group stage with a 2-0 win at Hajduk Split for a 6-2 aggregate triumph.
Alfonso Pedraza and Samuel Chukwueze scored the goals for the Spanish side who made the Champions League semi-finals last year.
In the Europa League, Hearts were beaten 1-0 at home by Swiss champions Zurich who went through 3-1 on aggregate.
Fabian Rohner scored the only goal of the second leg as the Scots were left to regret a red card handed out to midfielder Jorge Grant 10 minutes into the second half.
Despite the defeat, Hearts’ European adventure is not over as they now drop into the Conference League group stage instead.
Ludogorets of Bulgaria needed a last-gasp extra-time penalty by Olivier Verdon to secure a 3-3 draw and a 4-3 aggregate win over Zalgiris in Lithuania after trailing three times on the night.
Fenerbahce were the night’s biggest winners, a 4-1 victory over Austria Vienna giving the Turks a 6-1 win over two legs.

The Hong Kong Masters will take place on Oct 6-9 at a 10,000-seat venue and the local governing body said it could be the largest-ever live crowd at a snooker competition. The last edition of the Masters, in 2017, saw Neil Robertson beat O’Sullivan in the final. Both players will return, alongside Judd Trump, Mark Selby and John Higgins.
The Chinese city is trying to reboot its pandemic-hit sports scene but Vincent Law of the Hong Kong Billiard Sports Control Council said its  “harsh” virus measures, which follow a more lenient version of China’s zero-Covid strategy, had left many top international players baffled.“They don’t understand why Hong Kong, an international city, is still lagging behind in anti-epidemic policies,” Law told reporters.
The six overseas players will need to be isolated from the community in a Beijing Olympics-style  “closed loop”.

14,Verstappen quickest in second Belgian practice,SPA FRANCORCHAMPS: Red Bull’s Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen lapped fastest on Friday in practice...,"SPA FRANCORCHAMPS: Red Bull’s Formula One championship leader Max Verstappen lapped fastest on Friday in practice for a Belgian Grand Prix that he will start from the back end of the grid.
The Dutchman lapped the daunting Spa-Francorchamps track in one minute 45.507 seconds, a comfortable 0.862 seconds clear of his Ferrari title rival Charles Leclerc — who will also have a grid drop —in the second session.
The two championship frontrunners will start among the tail-enders after they collected engine and gearbox-related penalties.
Verstappen leads Leclerc by 80 points in the overall standings with nine races to go and does not need to win again to clinch a second successive title if results go his way.
But the penalties will come as a blow to Leclerc’s hopes, however unlikely, of closing the gap.
McLaren’s Lando Norris, 13th fastest in Fridays opening hour of practice, vaulted up to third in the second session but also has penalties that will send him to the back on Sunday.
Canadian Lance Stroll was fourth for Aston Martin ahead of Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz, the pacesetter in Friday’s first session.
Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, hopeful of scoring his first win of the season in an increasingly competitive Mercedes, was sixth ahead of Alpines Fernando Alonso and Mercedes team mate George Russell.
Australian Daniel Ricciardo, on his way out of McLaren at the end of the season, was ninth with Sergio Perez rounding out the top 10 for Red Bull.
The second session was largely trouble free in comparison to the first which was interrupted by a red flag after Kevin Magnussen ground to a halt on track in his Haas.
However, some drivers ran off track on a mist-wreathed circuit made damp by an intermittent drizzle of rain.

16,Liverpool seek lift-off against Bournemouth,LONDON: Liverpool’s  slow start has been the most surprising theme of the new Premier League  season and while...,"LONDON: Liverpool’s  slow start has been the most surprising theme of the new Premier League  season and while there is no sense of panic at Anfield the alarm bells  will start to ring if they fail to beat Bournemouth at home on Saturday. 
Three games in, Liverpool have managed only two points from fixtures against Fulham, Crystal Palace and supposed  “crisis club” Manchester United. 
Monday’s defeat at Old Trafford means Liverpool  have suffered their worst start to a season under Juergen Klopp and  have failed to win any of their opening three games for the first time  since 2012-13. 
There are mitigating factors, namely a long injury list, but the  sight of Manchester United out-running and out-pressing Klopp’s  unusually listless side will be a concern. 
Midfielder James Milner’s public dressing down of Virgil van Dijk  after United’s opening goal also hinted at some tension in the usually  tight-knit Liverpool ranks. 
Liverpool have yet to lead a game  this season as they have struggled to rediscover their trademark  intensity, a situation left back Andy Robertson said must change soon. 
“We gave every team a goal start and that’s the base of the game,” the Scot said after the Old Trafford defeat. 
“You can’t keep giving yourself an uphill battle. We’ve conceded  an early goal again, started slow again, that’s what needs to change. We  need to pull our fingers out quickly.”  Liverpool  will again be without new signing Darwin Nunez against Bournemouth as  he continues his suspension following a red card for a headbutt against  Palace. 
They will also be without midfielder Thiago Alcantara, striker  Diogo Jota, defender Ibrahima Konate against Bournemouth while  midfielder Naby Keita is doubtful. 
But even with so many absentees, Liverpool  will be expected to get their season up and running against promoted  Bournemouth who lost 4-0 to Manchester City and 3-0 to Arsenal in their  previous two league games. 
While Liverpool seek a first win, early leaders Arsenal will aim to maintain the only remaining 100 per cent record as they host Fulham on Saturday. 
It is Arsenal’s best start to a Premier League season for 17 years  and a mood of optimism is sweeping the club, although manager Mikel  Arteta remains cautious. 
“It is just three games, it doesn’t mean anything,” the Spaniard said. 
The weekend programme kicks off with Manchester United at Southampton, hoping to prove that their impressive defeat of Liverpool was no flash in the pan. 
Manager Erik ten Hag has challenged his players to repeat the work ethic they displayed against Liverpool every week. 
“What I demand is that players bring the top spirit every day. Every day, they have to bring it to the club,” he said. 
“It has to be a way of life and I hope they understand.”   Champions Manchester City, who dropped their first points in a 3-3 draw  at Newcastle United, host Crystal Palace while surprise package Leeds  United, who are third, aim to back up their win against Chelsea with an  away trip to Brighton who are also unbeaten. 
Fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur are away at Nottingham Forest on Sunday.
Fixtures Saturday: (1400 unless stated) Southampton v Manchester United  (1130), Brentford v Everton, Brighton v Leeds, Chelsea v Leicester,  Liverpool v Bournemouth, Manchester City v Crystal Palace, Arsenal v  Fulham (1630) 
Sunday: (1300 unless stated) Aston Villa v West Ham, Wolves  v Newcastle, Nottingham Forest v Tottenham (1530).
