Dr Ahmed appreciated the support from the Hungarian government for higher studies of Pakistani students. He said a large number of Nobel laureates are the graduates of Hungarian institutions, which is also food for thought for Pakistan as it continues its journey of strengthening higher education institutions.
He urged the Hungarian government to enhance the number of scholarships for Pakistani students. Shedding light on the background of the scholarship programme, Dr Shaista Sohail said these scholarships began in 2015 with award of 80 scholarships, which was increased to 200 every year in 2017. 
She highlighted that the government of Hungary has shown interest in continuing the cooperation and renew memorandum of understanding (MoU) for 200 scholarships annually for the next three years from 2023-2025. She underlined that a total of 772 scholarships, including for 565 bachelor’s, 161 master’s, and 46 PhD programmes were awarded to students from 2016 to 2021. 
Mr Takacs wished best of luck to the students departing for Hungary and assured that the Hungarian educational system will not pose any unpredictable obstacles for them in their pursuit of knowledge and higher education.
He said that the students going to Hungary have great potential as they have been selected from within a very high number of applicants.

2,Senate body approves amendments to CDA ordinance,ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary panel on Friday urged the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to ensure completion of...,"ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary panel on Friday urged the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to ensure completion of pending development projects and in this connection discussed the CDA (Amendment) Bill 2022 which seeks to make it obligatory on executing agencies to finish projects in pre-determined time.
Senate Standing Committee on Interior which met with Senator Mohsin Aziz in the chair, besides other agenda items, took up the Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2022 introduced by Senator Fawzia Arshad.
“Such a procedure should be devised with regard to these [stalled sectors] projects that new projects and schemes should not be approved until the completion of the ongoing projects so that grants can be issued to the projects in time,” said the committee chairman. Chief Commissioner and CDA Chief retired Capt Mohammad Usman presented CDA’s point of view. After some amendments, the committee approved the bill.
Speaking to Dawn, the mover of the bill said that the purpose of bringing the amendment is to make it obligatory for the CDA and other executing agencies including the federal government to execute and implement development schemes in a pre-determined time period, to prevent loss to the federal exchequer.
Various amendments to the CDA ordinance including imposition of section 405 of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) for delaying projects without providing any just and plausible reasons were proposed.
Committee members were of the view that imposition of section 405 would be too harsh against government officials, therefore, the committee did not agree with this amendment while all other amendments were approved.
Meanwhile, Islamabad Capital Territory Maternity Benefits (Amendment) Bill, 2022 also presented by Ms Arshad was considered in the committee meeting. The committee members unanimously approved the bill after due deliberations.
Earlier, the committee took a detailed look at the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2022. The proposed bill was sent to the Senate after approval by the National Assembly. The purpose of this bill is to bring the perpetrators of enforced disappearances to justice so as to provide some relief to the families whose loved ones went missing. 
Law ministry officials were of the view that the amendments proposed in the bill are already there in the existing law and there is no need for new legislation in this regard.
The committee chairman deferred discussion on the bill for one month. The Anti-Rape (Investigation and Prosecution) (Amendment) Bill, 2022 moved by Senator Mohsin Aziz was considered. Minister of State for Law, Senator Shahadat Awan, opposed the approval of the bill without consulting provinces. 
However, the committee members approved the bill with a majority vote.

The demonstration was held under the leadership of JI District Naib Emir Raza Shah and ended after a meeting was held with Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco) officials in Chandni Chowk. Participants of the demonstration were carrying placards and banners inscribed with slogans against the federal government and Iesco. 
Addressing the gathering, Mr Shah said that people rejected the increase in electricity bills as new taxes had been added in utility bills on the dictation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other organisations. He said the government would not be allowed to “kill people economically”. 
“If the government did not withdraw the increase in electricity bills, the JI will launch national protest and stage sit-in in front of the Parliament,” he said.
Other speakers said the burden of the luxury of rulers had been put on the poor, adding that the poor and the working class were being put under pressure.
They said that the incompetent government failed to deliver and the people were protesting at every square and intersection, adding that the fuel adjustment should end immediately. The IMF and World Bank are behind anti-poor policies which need to end immediately, they said, adding that the rulers should announce the end of their privileges.
Other JI leaders including Malik Imran and Bilal Zahoor, met Iesco Superintending Engineer Kamran Khan, who assured them that he would convey their message to high officials. He requested the JI to end the protest in the entire circle.

4,PML-N’s Hanif Abbasi demands relief for power consumers of 500 units,Calls for all stakeholders to be included in every policy and decision related to the economy.,"RAWALPINDI: Terming the government’s announcement to give relief to consumers of electricity bills using 200 units “a joke”, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice President Hanif Abbasi on Friday demanded relief for all people using 500 electricity units.
Addressing a press conference, Mr Abbasi said all electricity consumers should be exempted from fuel adjustment charges.
“If all types of taxes including fuel adjustment charges up to 500 units are not removed, traders across the city will come out on the streets,” he said.
President of Markazi Anjuman Tajran Sharjil Mir, Shahid Ghafoor Paracha, Arshad Awan and several local PML-N leaders were also present.
He said that the country’s economy cannot be run through such measures. “For the improvement of the country’s economy, Finance Minister Miftah Ismail should follow the policy of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and give relief to poverty stricken people.
“The formation of a committee to look into the matter is not a solution and the prime minister should immediately abolish all taxes in electricity bills.
“Due to continuous efforts of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, foreign investment of $10 billion will come to Pakistan and it is the responsibility of the finance department to give relief to people,” he said.
“There is no doubt that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is working day and night to stabilise the country’s economy and end people’s problems, while struggling with the natural calamity of floods,” he said, adding due to continuous efforts of the prime minister, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and China have agreed to invest $10 billion in Pakistan and this investment is coming before Sept 10.
He said the monthly bill of the industry was around Rs300,000, but now it is Rs700,000 and those who paid Rs15 million before are now paying Rs40 million. He said for residential consumers, who paid Rs3,500 and Rs5,000, in previous months are now forced to pay Rs14,000 to Rs16,000 for using 200 units.
He said the electricity bill had 11 different types of taxes including income tax, TR charges, fuel adjustment charges and general sales tax. 
He said the business class was ready to contribute to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund for the flood victims, but the government should keep in mind that the business community is the backbone of the country’s economy and the government should not try to break it.
He said that all stakeholders should be included in every policy and decision related to the economy. 
In response to a question, Mr Abbasi said that in a democratic society, dissent and protest is the right of a party worker, but this does not that he will part ways with Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif.
In response to another question, he said that the expected inflow of $10 billion by Sept 10 is only in terms of investment and it was not a loan. 
He said the performance of the Ministry of Finance had been contrary to the expectations.

The stone crushing activities came up during the meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Climate Change when MNA Murtaza Javed Abbasi raised the issue of the plants installed at the Margalla Hills National Park and Khanpur Dam areas.
Inspector General of Forest, Ministry of Climate Change, Ghulam Qadir Shah told the committee that there were 31 stone crushing plants functional as of now in the region and 11 of them were registered and the rest illegal.
“We have closed down several crushing plants and cases of five plants are under trial in the Supreme Court,” he said, adding Afghan mafias were behind the ordeal.
“We raised our voice in the assembly and the locals have also been protesting against the plants for the past two years. Due to the rains, the waste generated from the crushing units is being dumped/carried into the Khanpur Dam,” he added.
The meeting was informed that Afghans were allowed by the provincial government and they belonged to influential mafias.
In his remarks, the chairperson of the committee said people living in the vicinity were getting sick from the crushing activities. “There are complaints that blasting from the quarrying was a major concern also,” he said.
The chairperson summoned the KP chief secretary and directed that the next meeting would be held in the same area and also called the Ministry of Water Resources to participate.
In response to questions about the current flood situation across the the country, Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman said the abnormal monsoon rains had caused the heaviest floods in the country’s history that inundated many parts of the southern regions.
The minister said communication links with Balochistan had been severed. “Our helicopters are reaching the affected areas but returning due to unfavourable weather conditions,” she lamented, adding people were stranded and in urgent need to be rescued.

6,ECP issues final list of capital’s 101 union councils,"Schedule expected anytime after which polls will be held in 60 days, says official.","ISLAMABAD: As a positive development in holding the much-delayed local government elections in Islamabad, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Friday issued the final list of 101 constituencies (union councils). 
The delimitation of constituencies is the main prerequisite before issuing the schedule for the local government elections. Sources said now the ECP could issue the election schedule anytime. Once the schedule is issued, elections are to be held in 60 days. 
“Today, final lists of constituencies have been issued along with a notification. Now, the upcoming local government elections will be held in the 101 union councils instead of the previous 50,” said an official in the ECP headquarters. 
The local government in Islamabad completed its five-year term in February 2021 and elections should have been held within three months after that. 

Schedule expected anytime after which polls will be held in 60 days, says official

The former PTI government failed to hold the elections on time as, apparently, it wanted to get the elections held under a new Local Government Act but could not do so despite constant pressure from the ECP to hold the elections as soon as possible. But after much delay, the ECP earlier this year issued an election schedule fixing July 31 as the elections in the 50 UCs. However, PML-N, PPP and PTI filed a petition in Islamabad High Court, demanding that instead of holding the elections in 50 union councils, the number of UCs should be increased to 101 for better representation in Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI).
The IHC in July ordered for postponement of the elections for a few months when the ECP showed willingness to complete the delimitation of 101 union councils. 
The last elections that were held in 2015 were won by PML-N and subsequently Sheikh Anser Aziz was elected as the first mayor of Islamabad. However, the MCI failed to deliver as it could not get due patronage of then the ruling party, the PML-N.
The budding MCI was not given any funding from the federal government nor could have financial rules for proper disposal of works. Later, PTI came to power but it too did not pay any heeds towards MCI. Resultantly, the first ever local government completed its tenure in February last year even without paying due honorarium to the UC chairmen. On last day in their office, the UC chairmen were seen trying to get honorarium but to no avail.
Throughout five years, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and MCI remained at loggerhead as MCI was an offshoot of the CDA.
PML-N former UC chairman Sardar Mahtab while speaking to Dawn on Friday said his party was ready to participate in the upcoming elections. 
“We will repeat the results of 2015. We are hopeful PML-N will have its mayor and deputy mayors,” he said and added that ECP should issue the election schedule as soon as possible as people of Islamabad had been suffering since February 2021. “We will resolve issues of people at their doorsteps,” he said.
Meanwhile, PTI former UC chairman Raja Sheraz Kiani said his party will win a thumping victory in the local government elections. 
“Though we want holding of general elections to rid the country of the ‘imported government” as soon as possible but if the government wants to hold the local body elections before general elections they are welcome. We will give them a big surprise by clinching majority of seats,” he said.
He added that in general elections 2018, the PTI had won all three seats of MNAs in the capital, who performed brilliantly and now people of Islamabad will elect the mayor and all deputy mayors of PTI.

7,Chief commissioner’s appointment as CDA chairman challenged,ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday admitted for hearing a petition filed against the dual...,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday admitted for hearing a petition filed against the dual appointment of Chief Commissioner Islamabad retired Capt Mohammad Usman as the chairman of Capital Development Authority (CDA).
The petitioner, Riaz Hanif Rahi, who is an advocate by profession, filed the petition claiming it to be a public interest litigation (PIL).
Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb took up the petition and after preliminary hearing issued notices to the respondent authorities, including secretaries interior, cabinet and establishment division, and sought their reply in a fortnight.
The court also fixed for hearing another petition filed against the appointment of officers on key positions in the civic agency through deputation.
Mr Rahi contended that through a judgment passed against ex-mayor Islamabad Sheikh Ansar Aziz for holding the office of the CDA chairman the court had already discouraged dual appointments.
The petition said the federal government in violation of the said judgment issued a notification on August 22, 2022, appointing the chief commission (Mr Usman) as the CDA chairman.
It said Mr Usman a BS-20 officer of Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) was transferred from Punjab on August 16 and appointed as the chief commissioner and just a few days later was also given the lucrative post of the CDA chairman
The petition pointed out that duty hours in both the offices are the same and if Mr Usman would leave the commissioner office for duty in CDA, his absence from the chief commissioner office would warrant disciplinary action under the relevant law. Moreover, the part-time duty concept is not known in law. The duty of the chief commissioner in the CDA would be termed part-time.
It said governance with dual charge was not recognised by any law but otherwise amounted to crime as public offices are trust and part-time duty is its breach and misconduct.
According to the petition, the notification has been issued under section 6 (2) of CDA ordinance 1960 which carries different meanings and the chief commissioner as ex-officio member has not been recognised to be appointed as the chairman of the board.
It may be mentioned that IHC in the case of Sheikh Ansar Aziz had ruled that dual appointments were made in violation of the provisions of the CDA Ordinance and had directed the federal government to initiate the process to select an eligible person to be made a member of the CDA board for a fixed term as specified under section 6(3) of the ordinance, and to complete the selection process and appointment a chairman for a fixed five-year period from amongst the members.
The petition requested the court to set aside the dual charge of the chief commissioner.

9,"Rawalpindi sees upsurge in dengue, Covid-19 cases",DC asks govt departments to work in coordination as dengue cases increase due to more than normal rains.,"RAWALPINDI: While the district administration is bracing itself for an ‘aggressive’ campaign to check the spread of dengue virus in the wake of the prolonged wet spell, Covid-19 cases again started rising and on Friday claimed one more life.
Officials said 10 people tested positive for the deadly coronavirus. Danna Begum, 94, a resident of Sadiqabad, was brought to the Rawalpindi Institute of Urology (RIU) on Aug 26 where she died.
The positivity ratio of Covid-19 in the district was recorded at 0.69pc as 1,443 samples were collected and 1,433 of them were declared negative.
In Rawalpindi district, there are 101 active patients and all of them are home isolated. One patient each arrived from the city and cantonment areas, six from Potohar Town and one each from Gujar Khan and Taxila.

DC asks govt departments to work in coordination as dengue cases increase due to more than normal rains

With the start of the new spell of rains in the garrison city, the number of dengue patients has increased and 27 new patients landed in the three government hospitals taking the tally to 276.
Two patients arrived from cantonment areas, 17 from Potohar Town, one from Dhoke Ali Akbar, two from Kahuta, three from Taxila and two patients arrived from Islamabad.
A senior official of the District Health Authority told Dawn that the number of patients had increased to 276 in the district and it was expected that more patients would arrive in the hospitals in coming days.
He said total 525 houses were checked on Friday and dengue larvae were found in nine houses while the health authority launched an aggressive campaign to eliminate the dengue larvae.
Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Tahir Farooq reviewed the anti-dengue campaign and asked the departments concerned to work in coordination.
Mr Farooq said public cooperation was essential to control dengue.
“Dengue cases have increased due to more than normal rains during the current season,” he said.
He said more cases of dengue were reported from Union Council Chak Jalaldin of Potohar Town, adding dengue surveillance along with fogging and indoor residual surveillance was being carried out.
He said a health unit had been established in Chak Jalaldin where blood test for fever, cold and other symptoms were being carried out. He directed officials concerned to further improve dengue surveillance by conducting field visits on a daily basis and guide dengue workers regarding larvae destruction.
Taxila
In Taxila, the number of dengue patients increased to 16 on Friday, raising alarm bells among health officials and local administration.
According to official data of the local health department, seven of the patients belonged to various localities of Wah Cantonment while four were rural areas of Taxila, one from Taxila Cantonment. There were four suspected cases.
Deputy district officer health Dr Sara Qadeer confirmed that the number of dengue cases in the health facilities was increasing.
She said that the prevailing weather was suitable for the breeding of dengue larvae and advised citizens to adopt precautionary measures and inform the authorities concerned if they found the larvae in their houses and surroundings.
Responding to a question, she said that the present spell of rains had increased the threat of mosquito breeding which needed to be tackled on an emergency basis while the Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast more rains in next week.
Local residents said it seems the health department and the local administration have not learnt any lesson from the previous year’s experiences to identify the hotspots and carry out larvicide sprinkling in the high risk areas.
According to social circles, the authorities just focused on anti-dengue seminars and walks.
Health experts said larvicide sprinkling was carried out to destroy mosquito larvae, particularly ‘Aedes Aegypti’, the subspecies that caused the dengue fever.
Despite mosquito breeding season being at its peak, the authorities have delayed the sprinkling of larvicide by a month. The health department had in previous years identified dozens of breeding sites within the city and carried out fumigation to prevent the outbreak of dengue fever.
Due to collapsed sewage and sanitation systems in Taxila, there are several locations where stagnant water accumulates on roadsides and streets. This makes such areas breeding grounds for mosquitoes.
