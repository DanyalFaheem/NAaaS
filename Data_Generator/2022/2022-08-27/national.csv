0,Search warrant for Imran’s house sought,Satellite phone recovered from Shahbaz Gill’s lodge sent for forensic test.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad police have asked the high command to issue a search warrant for Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan’s Banigala residence in connection with the case against Dr Shahbaz Gill, while a satellite phone and a weapon recovered  from the ap­­artment allotted to Mr Gill at Par­l­iament Lodges have been  sent for forensic examination, Dawn has learnt.
Also, the police have made a list of PTI leaders who were at the house on Aug 8 and the media persons who had contacted the leaders.
The police claimed that Mr Gill appeared on the 4pm news bulletin of ARYNews through a landline at the former prime minister’s residence.

Satellite phone recovered from Gill’s lodge sent for forensic test

The list was prepared through geofencing and call data records of the people present there, senior police officers told Dawn, adding that the purpose was to ‘nominate them in the case as conspirators’.
Mr Khan’s house and a landline installed there were also used in the crime and legal proceedings were being initiated over it, they added.
“A report on the new developments in the case has been sent to senior officers concerned for the nod to initiate further legal proceedings.”
After the approval, search warrants will be issued for the residence and the arrest of alleged conspirators, they added.
In a separate development, a satellite phone and a weapon recovered from the apartment allotted to Mr Gill at Parliament Lodges have been sent for forensic examination, Dawn has learnt.
The police claimed to have recovered a 9mm pistol and a satellite phone during a raid at Mr Gill’s apartment on Aug 22.
When contacted, senior police officers told Dawn that call logs, text messages and other data available on the satellite phone will be retrieved. The pistol was sent for the examination for ballistic matching of bullets to verify if the weapon was used in any crime or not, the officers said.
Separately, Islamabad additional district and sessions judge (ADSJ) on Friday adjourned the hearing on post-arrest bail petition of Mr Gill due to the unavailability of the investigating officer.
The IO was summoned on Thursday to appear in the court with the case record. However, when ADSJ Tahir Abbas Sipra resumed the hearing on Friday, the judge was told that the IO had already left for Karachi to arrest an accused before the notice was delivered.
The judge then directed the police to produce the relevant record within two hours. However, the police expressed their inability to present the record at such short notice.
Subsequently, the matter was adjourned till Saturday (today).

1,LHC moved against ‘deal with Qatar on PIA control’,Court asked to restrain govt from striking “deal” with Qatar allegedly for selling 51pc PIA shares.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has been requested to restrain the federal government from striking a “deal” with Qatar allegedly for selling 51 per cent shares of the Pakistan Internat­ional Airlines (PIA), and handing over the administrative control of the national flag carrier and the Islamabad International Airport to the Gulf state.
Nabeel Ahmad Kahloon, a lawyer with expertise in aviation laws, has made this request through a writ petition, saying during a recent visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Qatar, a massive investment had been pledged by Doha in Pakistan’s aviation sector.
He stated, as per reports, Qatar expressed its interest in making investments in the airport and hotel sectors. He said that under the “deal” the federal government would hand over administrative affairs of the Islamabad International Airport to Qatar, whereas a Qatari company would provide the relevant services of the airport’s terminal and cargo.
The petitioner submitted that the Qatari government would also be given shares of the PIA’s Roosevelt Hotel in New York’s Manhattan in return for the investment. The investment would be received through state-to-state agreements between Pakistan and Qatar, he adds.
He further submitted that the worth of Islamabad airport’s land is around Rs4 trillion, besides the revenue being generated out of it. He argued that the government, while signing such a deal with the gulf country should keep the commercial potential of the land in mind.
The lawyer explained that PPRA rules would apply to all financial transactions since both the PIA and the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority were federal government entities. He argued that the federal government did not get approval of the parliament before making the impugned deals for the Qatar investments, whereas the PIA has been converted into a public limited company through PIA Conversion Act 2016, passed by the parliament.
He said any such impugned deal and sale of the national flag carrier need approval of the parliament through amendment in the relevant law.
The petitioner asked the court to declare the impugned deals by the government regarding sale of the PIA shares and surrendering admi­nistrative control of the Islamabad airport to Qatar as illegal.

2,Pakistani community in US against party politics during floods,"No separate army account for flood relief donations, says ISPR.","WASHINGTON: Pakistan reached out to the Pakistani-American community on Friday, urging them to help the rain and flood victims across the country, while community leaders asked people to “rise above party politics” during this natural calamity. 
“I urge you to step forward to help communities in distress in Pakistan in this difficult hour, to relieve their suffering and meet their needs for shelter, food, healthcare and rehabilitation,” Pakistan’s US Ambassador Masood Khan said in an open letter to the community. 
A statement issued by the ambassador’s office pointed out that to date, 66 districts in south Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan have been declared calamity hit. The rainfall in coming days is likely to wreak havoc in other areas as well. 
Earlier on Friday, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government declared a rain emergency in several districts of the province with immediate effect after the Provincial Disaster Manage­m­ent Authority warned of “high to very high floods” in Swat River. Sindh and Balochistan are witnessing the heaviest rainfall this year since 1961, as the two provinces recorded until Thu­rsday 522 and 469 per cent more than the annual downpour, respectively. 

No separate army account for flood relief donations, says ISPR

“There has been tragic loss of life and livestock as well as serious damage to the infrastructure and properties in Pakistan. Livelihoods have been disrupted; crops destroyed; and entire neighborhoods inundated. The magnitude of the calamity is too big; the losses enormous,” Ambassador Khan wrote. 
He then appealed to the people to “send whatever amount you can afford to the Prime Minister’s Flood Relief Fund 2022 to help your Pakistani brothers and sisters.” 
But community leaders warned that an appeal to donate to the Prime Minister’s Fund may not be very effective as an overwhelming majority in the Pakistani-American community supports Imran Khan. The leaders, however, urged the community to rise above party politics and focus on helping the flood victims. 
Dr Khalid Abdullah, who heads the Washington chapter of an international organisation called Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), suggested focusing on immediate relief and on “increasing our capacity to deal with such disasters”. 
“Monsoons are not new, nor are the floods. Such things have a regular pattern. By now, we should have been ready to absorb excessive water and even use it to our benefit,” he said. 
The organisation he heads specialises in dealing with the effects of climate change and has won two Nobel Peace Prizes for its efforts. 
Dr Talha Siddiqui, who is associated with the largest group of Pakistani physicians called APPNA, advised sending “money, tents and medicines”. He also alerted the authorities in Pakistan to prepare for the post-flood infectious diseases “that often do more damage than the flood itself”. 
“Start fund-raising, send money directly to the NGOs you trust. Trust the embassy and support their efforts,” said Dr Siddiqui when asked how the community could help. 
“No, this is no time for party politics,” said Johnny Bashir, who heads the Washington, Virginia chapter of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). He recalled that during the 2005 earthquake, the community in the greater Washington area sent two containers of goods to Pakistan. “And we are ready to do so again.” 
Mr Bashir said he plans to hold “a meeting of all groups and factions” at Brookfield Plaza, Virginia, to “promote unity”. 
Naveed Akhtar, PML-N’s chief organiser for Virginia, also emphasised the need for unity. “No party politics,” he said. “We should work as Pakistanis, putting aside politics. We should get together to see what is needed there.” 
Mr Akhtar, however, recalled that during the 2005 earthquake, some people donated their old clothes, which had to be discarded. “Please do not use such occasions for getting rid of your old clothes,” he said. 
Mr Akhtar too suggested working directly with NGOs in the field, but he also advised “using your friends’ relatives for directly distributing relief goods”. 
“No, no, no party politics,” said Zia Hassan, a member of the Pakistani American Business Association. “We should get together. Do a fund-raising. All should be invited. It should be a community-based effort.” 
‘No separate army account’
Meanwhile, the ISPR clarified that there is only one federal government account for flood relief donations, already announced by the government. “There is no separate account of Pakistan Army for flood relief donations. There are certain fake accounts being attributed to the army for flood relief donations. All such accounts are fake and public is requested to be aware of such fake appeals,” it added.
