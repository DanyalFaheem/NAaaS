0,PM announces Rs15bn grant to help Sindh cope with post-rain crises,SUKKUR: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said the federal government will provide Rs15 billion grant to the Sindh...,"SUKKUR: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said the federal government will provide Rs15 billion grant to the Sindh government to help it overcome the deepening crisis in the wake of widespread destruction of infrastructure and loss of lives caused by heavy rain and flash floods. 
The prime minister flanked by federal ministers Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Syed Khursheed Shah and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah told reporters at Sukkur barrage on Friday that the situation demanded all should rise above petty politics and help flood victims overcome their misery.  
Mr Sharif, who took an aerial view of inundated areas in Sukkur, Rohri, Khairpur, Faiz Ganj, Kot Diji and Thari Mir Wah after landing in Sukkur, expressed serious concern over loss of lives and infrastructure caused by the heavy rain and floods. 
He said the federal government’s grant would help the Sindh government carry out much-needed relief and rehabilitation operations. The coalition government would make collective efforts to alleviate suffering of the rain victims, he said. 
He said that over 900 people had died in floods over the past few months and it took a heavy toll on crops and livestock. 
He announced disbursement of Rs25,000 per household through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) starting from Friday and onwards and said around Rs28 billion would be given to the rain-affected people within one week. 
The prime minister said that a joint survey was being conducted by the departments of federal and provincial governments to assess the scale of damage. 
He lauded Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, for helping the flood-affected people and said that he had talked to army and naval chiefs who assured him of full support in relief and rescue operations. 
The prime minister said that the flooded grid stations in rain-hit areas would be switched on again after taking necessary measures. The power stations had been turned off to avert incidents of electrocution, he said and directed federal minister for power to remain in Sindh to oversee relief activities. 
He said that it was no time for politics. The federal and governments would not sit comfortably until each rain and flood affected person was rehabilitated, he vowed. 
He said that he had personally met rain-affected people in camps and he was satisfied with the care the Sindh government was showing them. The provincial government had provided people with food and other necessary things along with medical help at camps, he said. 
Though Pakistan was going through an economic crisis, the federal and provincial governments would not shirk their responsibility to help the rain-affected families, he said. 
The district administration of Sukkur and representatives of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority also briefed the prime minister about ongoing work for the relief of the flood-stricken people and the rehabilitation of infrastructure. 
The prime minister was informed that flood-hit areas also faced unavailability of communication services as the calamity had done severe damage to infrastructure in urban and rural areas. He was told that 43 food relief camps had been set up in Sindh where people were being given food and medicines. 
The chief minister urged media to highlight the plight of flood-affected people and show true picture of devastation to international donor agencies. The Sindh government would stand by the rain-affected families in their difficult time, he said. 
He urged international agencies such as UN, European Union and others to come forward to help humanity in this crisis. 
Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said the moment afforded a test for all political parties to help people in their hour of need. 
He thanked the prime minister for his announcement of compensation money for the victims through BISP and said that presently, tents were the most needed commodity.  
He said the current heavy rains had caused huge devastation in Sindh, homes were demolished and crops standing were completely destroyed. 
He advised all politicians to come together and help the calamity-hit families. The entire nation should come forward and help the victims, he said. 
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl Sindh general secretary Rashid Mehmood Soomro stressed joint efforts of the federal and provincial governments in addition to private sector to help the flood victims. 
Earlier, the prime minister accompanied by Mr Bhutto-Zardari and others visited relief camps in Sukkur district. When the prime minister was visiting the relief camp near BA college, rain-affected families from different areas had blocked some roads in protest against the administration’s failure to drain out stagnant rainwater. 
Both the prime minster and Bilawal talked to the rain-affected families and heard their grievances and listened to a briefing by irrigation officials at Sukkur barrage to review the situation and water flows passing through the gates of the barrage. 
Journalists protest 
Journalists staged a protest as they were neither issued cards nor were they allowed to talk to the prime minister. 
They were told that an official of Pakistan Information Department or Sindh Information Department would contact them but none contacted with journalists.  
Later, the prime minister talked to them after their protest. 
Khursheed Shah’s son faces people’s ire 
As the prime minster was in Sukkur, Zeerak Shah, younger son of Federal Minster for Water Resources Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah paid a visit to Bachal Shah area, one of the worst rain-hit areas in Sukkur district. 
On seeing him, enraged residents of the area chanted slogans against local and provincial governments and lashed out at the indifferent attitude of political representatives who had not visited them since the downpour had inundated the area and rendered them homeless. 
They surrounded Shah’s son and reminded him that it was callous of him to visit the rain-hit areas in double cabin vehicles and Landcruisers along with gunmen.

1,Day-long power breakdown hits Sukkur,SUKKUR: The entire city remained without electricity from 5am till late in the evening on Friday while Prime ...,"SUKKUR: The entire city remained without electricity from 5am till late in the evening on Friday while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif along with Pakistan Peoples Party chairman and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah was on a visit to different rain and flooding-hit areas of the district.
Water and gas supplies to citizens in the city were also severely affected while telecommunication and Internet services kept suffering frequent disruption whole the day.
The almost total collapse of utility and communication services rendered the routine life and all business and commercial activities crippled on a day when it did not rain at all in or around the city. 
When local officials of the Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco) were contacted to ascertain the reason for over 16 hours of breakdown, they claimed that a tree had fallen on the high-tension line and caused discontinuation of power supply to the city. They specified the site where, according to them, the incident had taken place but when some people went to the site, they found no such thing there.
The prolonged power breakdown rendered all water pumping stations in the city inoperative and caused suspension of water supply to consumers. People did not have potable water at homes and mosques for ablution even for Jumma prayers.
Torrential rains in the entire region for a couple of weeks have already paralysed the routine life with rainwater having accumulated on almost all roads and streets. Low-lying areas are still submerged with one to two feet high rainwater mixed with sewage. Drains have choked and people are finding it difficult to flush out water from their houses and shops.
Large groups of affected people have been holding demonstrations outside the offices of the Sukkur and Rohri municipalities for many days over their failure to drain out stagnant rainwater from roads, streets and lanes.

2,ATC to hold trial in Jazlan murder case,KARACHI: The administrative judge of the antiterrorism courts (ATCs) has transferred a case pertaining to the murder...,"KARACHI: The administrative judge of the antiterrorism courts (ATCs) has transferred a case pertaining to the murder of teenaged student Jazlan to the ATC-XVI for initiating a trial against five suspects, including three brothers and their father. 
Hasnain Faiz, his father, Muhammad Faiz, and brothers, Irfan Faiz and Ahsan Faiz, and their friend Inshal have been booked for shooting to death Jazlan over a trivial dispute in Bahria Town Karachi on May 25. 
Last week, the investigating officer (IO) had filed the final charge sheet in the case, accusing the three brothers, their father and friend of aiding and abetting the murder of the teenager. 
He also listed nine witnesses. 
In the final charge sheet, IO Inspector Aslam Jutt stated that the investigation, circumstantial evidence and statements of the witnesses suggested that suspect Ahsan shot dead Jazlan on the instigation of his father, Muhammad Faiz, for quarrelling with his brother, Hasnain, over a petty dispute. 
He added that Ahsan shot fires with a pistol, which was licensed in the name of his father, while his friend, Inshal also fired shots with another pistol at Shah Mir, Jazlan’s friend, and wounded him. 
The charge sheet stated that Hasnain, Irfan and Inshal opened fire on the victims – Jazlan and his friend Shah Mir -- with an intent to kill them and caused terror in the locality. Irfan while driving a car intercepted Jazlan’s car and beat them up. 
It also stated that suspect Muhammad Faiz instigated his sons to kill the victim and injure his friend by giving his own licensed pistol for unauthorised use in the offence, adding that later he hid the weapon and got registered a fake report regarding theft of his weapon at the A-Section police station in Ghotki. 
The charge sheet concluded that Ahsan, his brothers Irfan and Hasnain, and their friend, Inshal, had been found guilty of allegedly committing the murder of Jazlan and wounding his friend, Shah Mir, while Mr Faiz was found involved in abetting the offence by hiding the evidence (pistol) to hush up the matter. 
IO Jutt claimed that the suspects had been found guilty of committing offences punishable under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempted murder), 109 (abetment), 114 (abettor present when offence is committed), 216-A (penalty for harbouring robbers or dacoits) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code. He added that Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 was also incorporated in the FIR.

3,"Charity bodies face uphill task of taking aid to flood-hit areas of Sindh, Balochistan",Hundred of trucks carrying relief goods are stuck in traffic jams due to ruined infrastructure.,"• Camps set up across city for collection of donations and relief goods
• Accessibility to devastated areas becomes difficult due to broken, inundated roads
KARACHI: As heavy rains have triggered floods and wreaked havoc across the country, charity organisations and welfare bodies also pumped up their relief activities for hundreds of thousands of flood victims arriving at Karachi to seek shelter, but what emerges as the main challenge for the welfare bodies is to execute and take this huge gigantic operation to the disaster-hit areas after torrential rains have washed away key roads and highway links.  
Hundreds of volunteers from Karachi associated with different organisations have already left for flood-hit areas in Sindh and Balochistan but the people engaged in supervising these activities now find it difficult to transport the truckloads of relief goods to the affected towns and villages due to ruined infrastructure.  
They agree that the current level of crisis is much severe than the one which was witnessed in 2010.  
Sarfaraz Sheikh, who’s heading the disaster management cell of the Al-Khidmat, said his organisation was generating funds from across the country, but they were operating from Karachi for dispatching relief goods, recruiting volunteers and arranging resources for flood-hit districts of Sindh and Balochistan.  
“But the bigger challenge right now is that right from Hyderabad onwards, the whole province is inundated with flood water, whether it’s road, highway or any other alternative route,” he said.  
“So arranging resources is one challenge, but delivering them at the right place is another challenge. In order to meet this challenge we have redesigned our strategy. We have set up a massive kitchen in Sakrand and a second one is being opened in Sukkur tomorrow [Saturday] that will provide cooked food twice a day in all three major affected areas — Sukkur, Shikarpur and Jacobabad. We are coordinating with the local administrations and all other welfare organisations for better and effective operation.” 
He said Al-Khidmat had planned its operation in four areas — shelters, rations, medical camps and cooked and ready-to-eat food.  
Under this strategy, he said, the organisation had set up base camps in Sukkur and Sakrand for relief operation in Sindh.  
In Balochistan, he said, the team was engaged for last three weeks and camps were set up in Bela and Quetta.  
Zafar Abbass of the Jafria Disaster Cell (JDC), which has set up donation camps across the city, believes media moved a little late to highlight the tragedy that had been claiming lives and property for a month.  
But still, he appealed to Karachiites for donations and precisely mentioned a few things which were crucial in relief work.  
“We have been providing food, tents and rations and using dozens of boats to evacuate people marooned in flooded areas,” he said.  
“We have camps at Do Talwar, Numaish, Incholi and Five Star Chowrangi where people are offering donations. Both in Sindh and Balochistan, I have personally seen hundreds of villages turned flat, where homes, crops and every single structure have been wiped out. This tragedy is huge and we expect the same level of response from the people of Karachi.”  
He requested for more government efforts and assistance to all those charity and welfare organisations carrying out relief operations in Sindh and Balochistan.  
Hundred of trucks carrying relief goods are stuck in traffic jams due to ruined infrastructure and this issue must be resolved immediately for timely distribution of relief items to the affected people.  
Fears of epidemic 
Edhi Foundation, fears spread of epidemic diseases among children and women.  
A field hospital, the charity says, is being established in Jacobabad which will cater to thousands of patients.  
“Evacuation operation of our teams in Sindh is almost done and now it’s time to provide them shelters,” said an official of the charity.  
“We are running out of time and it’s very crucial to carry out this operation with all due care and planning. The children, women and elderly people are vulnerable to different viral and infectious diseases due to flooding. After arranging food and shelter, our volunteers are now working with medical teams to address healthcare issue.” 
Saylani Welfare has also set up a ‘logistic centre’ in Hyderabad, which is catering to the affected people in neighbouring areas and another one has been set up in Sukkur which is looking after the people in Khairpur, Kot Diji and Pano Aqil.  
“At least 50,000 people are being fed daily through this logistic centre,” said the charity’s spokesman.  
“Similarly, permanent kitchens have been set up in Matiari, Moosa Khatiyan, Kotri and Tando Jam. The evacuation in Sindh and Balochistan is almost done. Now the bigger challenge is the shelter and food for the homeless people. The people are sitting on main highways and roads under open sky. Their settlement needs gigantic effort.”

A statement issued by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the army chief would also visit troops busy in rescue and relief efforts in Sindh and Balochistan.
It said that an army flood relief centre was established at the Headquarters Army Air Defence Command Rawalpindi to oversee and coordinate the national flood relief efforts across the country in coordination with the directorate of military operations.
The flood relief centres being established in various parts of the country would assist collection, transportation and distribution of flood relief goods to rain-affected people in various provinces. 
The army troops were shifting people to safer places, providing shelter, meals and busy in their medical care.
The statement said that the army relief efforts continued in the flood-hit areas of Sindh.
The forward bases are still functional at Nagarparker, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Mirpurkhas and Dadu districts for providing ration and relief items among flood affectees.
As many as three additional forward bases were established at Tando Allahyar and Matiari. The mobile medical teams were providing medical care in far-flung areas of the province.
In Kot Diji, the army teams carried out dewatering operations and also distributed ration bags, it said, adding that in Khairpur, the evacuation operation was carried out by the troops.

5,Resentment among govt employees over ‘forced’ deduction from salary for flood relief fund,Sindh govt exempts judicial officers and staff from pay deductions.,"KARACHI: The Sindh government’s decision to deduct at source the salaries of the provincial government employees, including college and university teachers as well as judicial staff, has sent a wave of resentment and shocked those low cadre staff who themselves hail from the calamity-hit areas in the province, it emerged on Friday.
The provincial government on Wednesday established the Sindh Flood Relief Fund (SFRF) for the people affected by torrential rains and flash floods across the province and notified that five-day salary of government officers from BPS-17 to BPS-22 and two-day salary of employees from BPS-1 to BPS-16 would be deducted.
On Thursday, almost every government employee received intimation from the finance department about at source deduction from their salary.
“I got a message that Rs25,000 are deducted from my monthly pay...this is sheer injustice with people like us,” said an assistant professor at a government college.
The government employees said that the “forced” deduction of salary would add to their financial woes as they were themselves in dire need of financial assistance to make up the losses caused by torrential rains.
The bodies of college and university teachers had also rejected the forced deduction of salaries and termed it a cruel decision.
However, the provincial government on Friday issued another notification exempting all the cadre officers and staff of the high court and subordinate judiciary from deduction on account of contribution toward the SFRF.
The notification was apparently issued following a letter written to the finance secretary by Assistant Session Judge Karachi West Faique Ali Pathan to the provincial government against deductions from the salaries of the government employees for flood victims.
He wrote that even lands of the government employees are affected from the ongoing floods. 
He claimed that such deductions without the permission of the employees were against the Constitution and demanded that the finance department halt such deductions and return the money to employees.
The judge warned that if the money was not returned then they would also approach the Sindh High Court. “I am being paid salary for services rendered by me and there is no any act of kindness or grace on the part of the government in paying me salary.”
“The civil servant has to pay liabilities and maintain his family from salary, hence such type of forceful deduction of the salary of an employee without his consent is arbitrary and unconstitutional,” he said.
Later in the day, the finance department, without citing any reason, issued a notification stating that the government of Sindh “has been pleased to exempt all the cadre officers and staff of Sindh High Court and its benches and circuit courts, judicial officers and staff of district and civil courts of Sindh” from deductions on account of contribution towards the SFRF.

8,Poor turnout mars ‘peaceful’ NA-245 Karachi by-election: report,Fafen says less than 12pc turnout indicates the failure of political parties in mobilising voters.,"ISLAMABAD: Although the by-election for Karachi’s NA-245 constituency was conducted in a peaceful manner, the low turnout of a mere 11.8 per cent eclipsed the otherwise well-organised polling activity, the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) said in its report.
The poll was held on Aug 21, after the seat fell vacant due to the demise of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain.
Fafen, in its report analysing the polling activity, said that the low turnout indicated the candidates’ and political parties’ failure to mobilise most of the voters (88pc) to cast their votes.
The constituency had 515,003 registered voters, for whom, 263 polling stations were established, the reports said, while quoting the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) data.
Fafen said that it had deployed 11 observers on the polling day who reported smooth conduct of the polling with no untoward incident.
The 11.8pc voter turnout was significantly lower than the 37.6pc turnout in the constituency during the 2018 general election. “This voting rate is reflective of the usual trend of low turnout in by-elections. The recent by-election in National Assembly constituencies NA-240 Korangi Karachi-II in June and NA-33 Hangu in April registered eight per cent and 14pc turnouts, respectively.”
Women’s turnout in the by-election was even lower, with only 8.2pc of female voters casting their votes.
It said during 2018 general election, nine political parties and six independent candidates contested for the NA-245 seat. During the recent by-election, candidates from nine political parties along with eight independent candidates contested for the seat. The report said that out of the 17 candidates only one was a woman.
“This demonstrates a trend of low political participation of women in the constituency,” the report noted, adding that the parties should promote active participation of women, not only as voters but also candidates.
According to Fafen’s observers, polling activity at every polling station started at 8:00am.
In comparison to the 2018 general elections, there was a 16.1pc increase in the number of registered voters in this by-election. Consequently, the ECP established 15pc more polling stations in the constituency to accommodate them.
Polling agents were present at as many as eight (72.7 percent) of the observed polling stations. Empty ballot boxes were shown to all the polling agents present prior to the start of polling, and no polling agent raised any objection to the pre-poll proceedings at the observed polling stations, it said.
Meanwhile, the polling process was well organised with adequate security arrangements. There was only one instance of a verbal altercation between voters at one of the observed polling stations.
The report said that the role of security personnel was critical to maintaining peace and ensuring that all voters got equal access regardless of their gender, disabilities, or status, as required in the election law. As per the observation reports, security personnel were deployed at all the observed polling stations and were observed to be giving priority facilitation to persons with disabilities (PWD), senior citizens, transgender persons, pregnant women, and mothers carrying infants. However, wheelchair ramps were observed to be available at only three (7.1pc) of the observed polling stations, hindering equal accessibility for PWDs and even dissuading them where there was no such facility.
However, pointing out the deficiencies, the reports noted that in clear violation of the code of conduct, party camps were set up within 100 metres of polling stations at 24 locations.
Moreover, candidates also provided transportation facilities to the voters at nine of the observed polling stations, the report said.
The process of counting votes at 10 polling was ‘largely compliant’ with the relevant legal and procedural requirements, as per the observers’ findings.
At all the observed polling stations, the report said, the candidates/polling agents present during the process of counting signed the Form-45.
PTI’s candidate won with 29,475 (48.5pc) votes, MQM-P’s candidate was the runner-up with 13,193 (21.7pc) votes, followed by the TLP candidate who secured 9,836 (16.2pc) votes.
The placement followed a similar pattern from the 2018 general election when PTI obtained 34pc, MQM-P obtained 21.2pc, and TLP obtained 12.4pc of the votes.
Talking about the result, Fafen said that despite ‘increasing political friction between the ruling coalition and PTI,’ no objections were raised to the outcome of the election.

9,Memory on a loop,"KARACHI: The Franco-Czech novelist, Milan Kundera, in one of his books comes up with the...","KARACHI: The Franco-Czech novelist, Milan Kundera, in one of his books comes up with the following insight: “The degree of slowness is directly proportional to the intensity of memory. The degree of speed is directly proportional to the intensity of forgetting.” 
This implies, although it can be interpreted in other ways too, we are bogged down by the burden of memory. The sooner we start to let go of things, the quicker we move. It’s easier said than done, though. A group show titled Reprise that’s concluded on Thursday at the Canvas Art Gallery touched upon the same subject in a pretty impressive way. 
The participating artists were: Mubashar Iqbal, Rehana Mangi, Tahira Noreen and Yasser Vayani. 
They pick, as they should, a variety of media, different to each other’s, to express their creative views on the topic. But what are they aiming for? The gallery comes up with the following note: “Reprise brings together the practices of four artists experimenting with ideas and themes of repetition and memory. Translating the social and cultural issues of their surroundings into unique pieces of work, the show encapsulates each artist’s personal observations and experiences harmonising with the other.” 
The four creative souls examine the repetitive aspect of the above statement, which is to do with the persistence of recollection. They don’t necessarily take it as a negative occurrence. Rather, they look at it as something we can’t do without; and if it’s detrimental to our growth, ways must be found to circumvent it. This is a prosaic explanation of things. The artists do that with poetic grace. 
One uses lines to home in on symmetry, the other also takes the geometric route but with travel experiences and surroundings in mind, another talks about ‘roving eyes’, and the fourth focuses on the issue of conflict and its aftermath... all in relation to memory. 
As a result, the viewer gets to see striking exhibits such as ‘Triangles’ (archival ink on archival paper), ‘Fraction III’ (precision cutter on wasli), ‘The Elephant Queen’ (thumb pins on cloth) and ‘Within the Silence’ (acrylics on canvas).

The SHC noted that it was the provincial assembly which had to make meaningful legislation for betterment and uplift of the provincial metropolis.
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh and comprising Justice Yousuf Ali Sayeed made these observations while dismissing a petition seeking directives for the Sindh government to rebuild roads, sewerage lines and other infrastructure damaged during heavy rains and to release special funds for the uplift of Karachi.
A regular litigant petitioned the SHC stating that cosmetic and so-called development schemes and tenders would be floated on the pretext of rehabilitation of the city to usurp the funds likely to be allocated.
The petitioner submitted that a separate master plan for the city be prepared and carried out through the master plan department of the Karachi Development Authority (KDA).
He said the Sindh Building Control Authority had been receiving a fee for approval of building plans and it should give the fee to the KDA.
He also pleaded that a committee of retired judges of the SHC be formed to ensure fulfilment of the fundamental rights and precise disbursement of funds so allocated by the government to official respondents.
The bench in its order said, “So far as the submission of the petitioner directing the respondent to prepare a separate master plan for the city, allocate special funds for reconstruction of the roads, sewerage lines, etc. it is the exclusive domain of the Provincial Government whereas it is for the Assembly to make meaningful legislation for betterment and uplift of the City.”
It further noted that the Constitution envisaged the trichotomy of powers amongst three organs of the state — legislature, executive and judiciary — and none of such organs can encroach upon the field of others.
About formation of a committee of retired judges, the bench stated that the same did not appeal to reason as the petitioner or voters of the respective areas may raise their voice and get the issues resolved through their elected representatives.
“For the foregoing reasons we do not find any force in the petition, which is accordingly dismissed,” it concluded.

Sources said the facility jointly run by the directorate of women development and the university was established in 2012 under a scheme, which was revisited twice and finally ended on June 30, 2022.
Speaking to Dawn, representatives of Karachi University Teachers’ Society (Kuts) said the centre was closed down a week ago after the women development department conveyed to the university administration that the scheme under which the day care centre was set up had ended and now there was a need for a new memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the administration.
“Under the old agreement, the university was responsible for maintenance and payment of utility bills and the department had provided the staff. Now, the department wants the university to take whole responsibility of running the centre,” explained Prof Shah Ali-ul-Qader heading Kuts.
The university, he said, presently had no qualified staff for child day care, which was a specialised field.
KU Vice Chancellor Prof Khalid Mehmood Iraqi said he recently received a draft of the new agreement seeking complete operation of the facility by the university.
“The female staff on the campus has been facing a lot of problems after the closure of the centre. It’s unfortunate that the women development department instead of facilitating the working women more has taken a unilateral decision for its closure,” he said.
“I will intend to take up this matter with the women development minister next week. Right now, we don’t have specialised staff to run the facility,” the VC said, adding that the space and land belonged to the university and the department used to charge parents for the service.

The lands and villages along the Indus submerged due to the river overtopping its embankments at many places while the areas falling away from the Indus embankments were inundated owing to overflowing canals and other irrigation channels. Diversion of natural waterways amid heavy rains over the last two weeks also contributed to heavy flooding.  
Hundreds of thousands of people have been rendered homeless and a large number of them have been migrating to dry high lands or cities close to their destroyed villages.
Hill torrents and deluges from mountainous Khirthar region and heavy rains in all talukas of Dadu and Jamshoro districts flooded 150 more villages of Faridabad and Charo areas of Mehar taluka and caused a 200-foot-wide breach in a canal at Maro Ja Thulh village. The land communication between Johi town and 400 villages of 15 union councils in Kachho belt has remained cut off since July 7.
Relief goods awaited
THATTA: A large number of rain-hit families, who have taken shelter on dunes and on the roadside along main Thatta-Sujawal road, are waiting for government aid for the past 12 days.
The downpour that has battered the province for over two months has proved the most devastating for Sujawal, Tando Mohammad Khan and Badin, which also face sea intrusion, compelling the population to rush to highlands.
Sources in the district administration said that around 30 villages had submerged in rainwater over the past couple of days in the riverine area of Thatta and Sujawal districts after surge in the Indus River.
A warning has been issued by the deputy commissioners of the two districts asking the inhabitants of villages located near the river’s bank to move to highlands as the water was fast heading to low-lying areas.
Many areas have turned into tent cities where hundreds of flood-affected families have been settled by Pakistan Army and district administration. 
Meanwhile, cases of snakebite have been reported from different parts of Sujawal district. An elderly man died of snakebite in flood-hit Jati amid complaints of unavailability of anti-snake venom in hospitals.
Demos held for relief 
MIRPURKHAS: Several hundred families displaced by rain and flooding in different towns of this district held demonstrations outside DC’s office on Friday against the administration’s failure to provide them relief goods, including shelter and food, for many days.
They deplored that they were staying under open sky on roads but no one came to them to help out.
A similar demonstration was held by rain-hit families near Leghari Pump along the main Mirwah Gorchani road. The protesters placed burning tyres and junk in the middle of the road to block vehicular traffic for some time.
In Sindhri taluka, a 20-foot-wide breach in LBOD caused flooding in more than a dozen villages on Friday.
Meanwhile, a 12-year-old boy, Azan, was killed and four of his family members were injured when the roof of a room in their house, weakened by recent downpour, collapsed near Kingoro Shakh locality of Digri taluka late Thursday night.
