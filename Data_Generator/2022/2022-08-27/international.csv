0,Justice dept sheds light on probe into Trump papers,A heavily redacted affidavit about documents at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate that was released on Friday.,"WASHINGTON: The US Department of Justice unveiled fresh details on Friday about its investigation into government papers that former president Donald Trump removed from the White House, including 184 classified documents, some of which were labelled as “top secret” and contained sensitive information about government informants and intelligence-gathering.
A heavily redacted affidavit about documents at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate that was released on Friday did not itself unveil any major new revelations. But the details in the affidavit could help explain why the Justice Department sought court approval for an Aug 8 search as much of the 32-page affidavit remains under seal.
In a separate filing made public on Friday, the Justice Department said that information must remain confidential to protect a significant number of civilian witnesses, as well as law enforcement and the integrity of the investigation itself. Much of that court filing was also redacted.
An Aug. 8 search by the FBI at the Florida resort marked a significant escalation in one of the many federal and state investigations Trump is facing from his time in office and in private business. The Republican former president has suggested he might run for the White House again. He has described the search as politically motivated.

1,Mirwaiz denied permission to address Friday prayers,NEW DELHI: Hurriyat Confe­rence chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was denied perimission again after hopes were raised...,"NEW DELHI: Hurriyat Confe­rence chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was denied perimission again after hopes were raised that he would address his first Friday congregation since the dismantling of Jammu and Kashmir three years.
On Friday, the Mirwaiz nailed the government’s lie when prepared to visit Srinagar’s Jama Masjid but was police stopped him from leaving his house.
The incident occurred days after J&K lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha said the chief cleric was not under house arrest. Mr Sinha in an interview to BBC last week denied that Mirwaiz was under house arrest. 
“He is neither arrested nor detained. He must decide what he wants to do,” Manoj Sinha had told BBC Hindi.The J&K administration too had claimed that Mirwaiz was a “free man” and the security forces deployed at his residence were “meant for his protection”.
The denying of permission to Mirwaiz to step out of his home comes a day after Anjuman Auqaf Jamia Masjid (AAJM) had announced that all preparations had been made to facilitate Kashmir’s chief cleric to deliver the khutba (sermon) and also lead the congregational prayers after nearly three years. 
The AAJM is the  managing body of the 14th-century Jama Masjid in Srinagar’s Nowhatta locality, How­ever, as soon as Mirwaiz’s vehicle reached the main gate of his residence, two police officers stopped it, telling him not to venture out.
“The LG has announced that I am a free man… I am going to Jamia Masjid to discharge my religious duties as Mirwaiz. Why am I being stopped?” he asked the police officers.One of the officers responded that a security review was going on due to which he would not be allowed to leave. The Mirwaiz said his rights as a citizen were being forfeited despite the LG making a clear statement that there were no curbs placed on his movement.
Stepping out of the car, the Mirwaiz tried to walk out through the main gate but was stopped by police personnel accompanying the two officers, The Wire said.
“Please give me something in writing about why I am being stopped. The home minister has said on the floor of Parliament that no one in Kashmir is under house arrest. The LG has made statements to international media on the same lines but you are here to stop me,” he said.
The Mirwaiz sought to know if the government was not claiming that everything in Kashmir had returned to normal and people were happy. “I want to join my people in their happiness. Why are you stopping me?” he asked before being turned back.

2,"Japan keen to hold Lanka creditors’ meeting, but China remains cautious","TOKYO: Japan is seeking to organise a Sri Lanka creditors’ conference, hoping it could help solve the South Asia...","TOKYO: Japan is seeking to organise a Sri Lanka creditors’ conference, hoping it could help solve the South Asia nation’s debt crisis, but uncertainties cloud the outlook for any talks, three people with knowledge of the planning said.
Tokyo is open to hosting talks among all the creditor nations aimed at lifting Colombo from its worst debt crisis since independence, but it is not clear whether top creditor China would join and a lack of clarity remains about Sri Lanka’s finances, one source said.
Japan would be willing to chair such a meeting with China if that would speed up the process for addressing Sri Lanka’s debt, estimated at $6.2 billion on a bilateral basis at the end of 2020, this source said.
President Ranil Wickremesinghe said last week that Sri Lanka would ask Japan to invite the main creditor nations to talks on restructuring bilateral debts. He said he would discuss the issue with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in Tokyo next month, when he is expected to attend the funeral of assassinated former premier Shinzo Abe.
Tokyo, the number two creditor, has a stake in rescuing Sri Lanka, not just to recoup its $3 billion in loans but also its diplomatic interest in checking China’s growing presence in the region.
S&P Global this month downgraded Sri Lanka’s government bonds to default after it missed interest and principal payments. The island nation of 22 million people off India’s southern tip, with debt at 114 percent of annual economic output, is in social and financial upheaval from the impact of Covid pandemic on top of years of economic mismanagement.
An International Monetary Fund (IMF) team met Wickremesinghe on Wednesday to discuss a bailout, including restructuring $29bn in debt, as Colombo seeks a $3bn IMF aid programme. The president met Japan’s ambassador the same day.
Tokyo believes a new “platform” is needed to pull creditors together, the sources said.
“Sri Lanka is running out of time since it defaulted on its debt. The priority is for creditor nations to agree on an effective scheme,” one source said.
“Japan is keen to move this forward. But it’s not something Japan alone can raise its hand and push through,” said the source, adding that the cooperation of other nations was crucial.
New framework needed 
Concerns include rivalry and territorial tensions between big creditors China and India, while Sri Lanka would have to commit to reforming its finances and disclose more information about its debt, the sources said.
Last month, shortly after Wickremesinghe took office when his predecessor fled the country, Chinese President Xi Jinping wrote to him that he was “ready to provide support and assistance to the best of my ability to President Wickremesinghe and the people of Sri Lanka in their efforts”.
But the sources said getting Beijing’s cooperation on a debt restructuring was complicated by factors such as a large number of lenders and that China was balking at taking a “haircut” on its loans and at reducing Colombo’s debt burden.
A Chinese spokesman said Beijing was  “willing to stand with relevant countries and international financial institutions and continue to play a positive role in helping Sri Lanka respond to its present difficulties, relieve its debt burden and realise sustainable development”.

3,Belarus planes ‘modified’ to carry N-weapons,President says Minsk would react immediately if the West causes it any problems.,"MINSK: Belarusian Presi­dent Alexander Lukashenko said on Friday that his country’s warplanes had been modified to carry nuclear weapons and that Minsk would react immediately if the West caused it any problems.
Lukashenko said he had agreed the move to modernise Belarusian warplanes with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Belta news agency reported.
Belarus, a staunch Russian ally, does not have its own nuclear weapons. Lukashenko did not go into details about how a weapons transfer from Moscow, which is using Belarusian territory to mount its military operation against Ukraine, might take place.
Belta cited Lukashenko as talking about a potential future threat from neighbouring Poland, a Nato member, while saying he was confident that the Polish military, unlike Warsaw’s politicians, understood how Minsk could respond to what he called any escalation.
His overall remarks appeared to be referring to a potential threat from the West in general.
“They (the West) must understand that if they opt for escalation no helicopters or planes will save them,” Lukashenko was quoted as saying.
“Everything was ready,” he said, referring to the work to modify Belarusian warplanes to carry nuclear weapons.
“It’s not a good idea to escalate things with Belarus because that would be an escalation with the Union State (of Russia and Belarus) which has nuclear weapons. If they start to create problems ... the response will be immediate.”

4,White House blasts Republicans as four more states ban abortion,WASHINGTON: The White House on Friday blasted the latest set of “radical” abortion restrictions in four more...,"WASHINGTON: The White House on Friday blasted the latest set of “radical” abortion restrictions in four more states run by Republicans, signalling President Joe Biden’s determination to lean on the issue ahead of tight November congressional elections.
“Today marks the latest attack against the fundamental rights of Americans as new abortion bans go into effect in Idaho, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas,” Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.
“These near-total abortion bans are part of a growing effort by Republican legislators to roll back the freedoms Americans have relied on for nearly half a century. “Today’s radical steps take away women’s reproductive rights and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians instead of women and their doctors,” she said.
There are now full-scale abortion bans in 12 Republican-controlled states, which had prepared so-called trigger laws ready to be activated when the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe versus Wade decision ensuring automatic rights to abortion access nationwide.
The ruling two months ago put jurisdiction over abortion access in the hands of individual state legislatures, immediately turning swaths of the country into areas where getting the procedure has become all but impossible.
Jean-Pierre echoed Biden’s frequent demand for Congress to pass a new law enshrining nationwide abortion rights and urged “people across the country to make their voices heard” ahead of the November mid-term elections, which will decide whether Democrats retain their narrow hold on the legislature.
Republicans have fought for decades to overturn the 1973 Roe versus Wade decision and finally achieved their goal in a Supreme Court that tilted sharply to conservative interpretations of the constitution after Donald Trump filled three vacancies during his one-term presidency.

5,India’s illegal ‘Twin Towers’ to be blown up,A controlled implosion will bring down the 100-metre-high “Twin Towers” on New Delhi’s outskirts; residents being evacuated.,"NOIDA: Two illegally built residential high-rises are slated for demolition near India’s capital this weekend in a rare crackdown on developers who cut corners and swindle unsuspecting home-buyers.
A controlled implosion will bring down the 100-metre-high “Twin Towers” on New Delhi’s outskirts after a court ruling last year found the structures were built unlawfully in collusion with local authorities.
Thousands of anxious residents — along with dozens of stray dogs — are being evacuated from the vicinity, but the crew in charge of the knock-down said safety was assured.
“It’s a beautiful feat of engineering,” said demolition team leader Joe Brinkmann, according to the Times of India newspaper.
“Just pack your bags and enjoy the day.” 
The towers will be fitted with around 3,500 kilos of explosives and are expected to come down in a matter of seconds.
The world’s fastest-growing major economy has seen a construction boom in recent years, but developers often cut corners with impunity.
Eyeing fat profits and capitalising on weak regulation, companies often build extra floors or towers and use sub-standard materials, while officials are bribed to keep quiet.
Middle-class home-buyers fall into the trap of investing their life savings in projects that often never see the light of day, and get drawn into protracted legal battles against powerful builders.

6,US presses India to cap prices of Russian oil,India and China have stepped up oil purchases from Russia after the Ukr­aine invasion at a discount to the market price.,"NEW DELHI: The United States had constructive discussions with Indian officials on a proposal to cap prices of Russian oil, US Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said on Friday, as it seeks global support for a proposal to cut Russian revenue.
India and China have stepped up oil purchases from Russia after the Ukr­aine invasion at a discount to the market price, at a time Western sanctions have pushed global inflation to the highest levels in years and hurt revenues of Eur­opean and American companies linked to Russia’s oil trade.
The Group of Seven aims to have a price-capping mechanism on Russian oil exports in place by Dec 5, when European Union sanctions banning seaborne imports of Russian crude come into force.
“I had a very constructive conversation with my Indian counterparts about the price cap proposal, but also talked extensively with private sector participants in India as well,” Adeyemo told reporters in New Delhi on Friday.
The proposal to cap prices of Russian oil is aimed at curbing the oil revenue that Moscow uses to finance its invasion of Ukraine, while ensuring sufficient global supply at affordable prices, Adeyemo said.

7,Russia accused of burning gas into atmosphere amid cut in supplies to EU,Analysts estimate that amount of gas being burned off into atmosphere is equivalent to about 0.5pc of daily EU needs.,"MOSCOW: Russia is wasting large volumes of natural gas by burning it in a huge orange flare near the Finnish border at a time when it has sharply cut deliveries to the European Union, scientists and analysts said on Friday.
Analysts from Rystad, an energy consultancy based in Norway, described it as an environmental disaster and estimated the amount of gas being burned off into the atmosphere was equivalent to about 0.5 percent of daily EU needs.
The spectacular flare can be seen in satellite images of Portovaya, site of a compressor station for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany.
Russia has cut flows through Nord Stream 1 to just 20 percent of capacity and plans to shut it down entirely for three days next week, citing maintenance issues with turbines. The EU accuses it of using gas as a weapon to fight back against Western sanctions over Ukraine.
Flaring is a common practice in oil and gas production, but the current level is unusually high and the timing is sensitive because of the Russian supply cuts.
Rystad analysts wrote: “Exact flaring volumes levels are hard to quantify but are believed to be at levels of around 4.34 million cubic meters per day. This equates to 1.6 billion cubic meters (bcm) on an annualized basis and is equal to around 0.5 percent of the EU’s gas demand needs.” 
The flaring was first reported in Finland, which borders Russia, earlier this month.
Professor Esa Vakkilainen at the Lut University, Lappeenranta, said Gazprom may have been burning as much as 1,000 euros worth of gas per hour for the past two months, while flaring was damaging the atmosphere.
“So this is also a big environmental problem, especially for the North Pole area where this soot has definitely an effect on global warming,” he said.
President Vladimir Putin has said that Russia, the world’s fourth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, will strive to be carbon neutral no later than 2060, while the EU and other countries have urged Moscow to bring the goal forward by a decade. 
Gazprom cut its natural gas output by more than 13 percent from the start of the year until mid-August to around 275 billion cubic metres. Its gas exports outside the former Soviet Union have declined by over 36 percent to 78.5 bcm amid the standoff with the West over Ukraine.
While most domestic experts have said that Gazprom could simply turn off the taps to regulate production, the company still has to burn off excess gas.
“The flaring is an environmental disaster with around 9,000 tonnes of CO2 being emitted daily,” Rystad said.
Poland, Slovakia open gas link 
Poland and Slovakia on Friday inaugurated a gas pipeline linking their networks that could boost their energy security after the Ukraine invasion sparked a European energy crunch.
Russia has reduced or halted gas supplies to several European Union countries in recent months, with Poland cut off and Slovakia receiving only 40 percent of the agreed volume.
The interconnector will allow Slovakia to receive gas from Norway as well as liquefied natural gas transiting through Poland, said Slovak Prime Minister Eduard Heger at a press conference to inaugurate the facility alongside Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki.

8,"Van driver hits Brussels cafe terrace, sparks alarm",BRUSSELS: A van driver ploughed through a crowded cafe terrace in Brussels city centre shopping and tourism district...,"BRUSSELS: A van driver ploughed through a crowded cafe terrace in Brussels city centre shopping and tourism district on Friday, slightly wounding six people before escaping the scene.
A suspect was later arrested in the northern port city of Antwerp and he is to be questioned, but prosecutors said that it was not yet clear whether the incident was an attack or an accident.
“The investigation is still in progress to clarify the exact circumstances. At this stage various lines of inquiry are still open and the motives of the suspect are not yet known.” Brussels prosecutor’s spokewoman said.
“The evidence does recall attacks that have been committed in the past, but for the moment it is not yet certain that it is an attack, it is possible that it was only an accident,” she told reporters. Belgium’s terrorism tracking unit briefly raised the threat level in the capital from “medium” to “serious” _ from two to three on a scale of four.
But the level was dropped back to medium a few hours later after officials found “reassuring elements in their investigation”, a spokesman said.
Initially, police had said it was too soon to speculate on whether the driver had deliberately targeted the diners. But investigators found the van abandoned near the scene.
“Shortly before 1pm, a van drove into a terrace on Saint Michel street. The driver fled in his vehicle, the emergency services were very quickly on the spot,” a spokeswoman said.
