The data released by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) showed that 236 people were infected by the virus and the positivity rate was 1.55pc. The data further revealed that 15,191 Covid-19 tests were performed across the country while 152 patients were on critical care, but no death was reported.
The data released on Tuesday had shown that only 4,674 tests had been conducted and out of these, 255 had been found positive and the positivity rate was 5.46pc.

With no deaths reported, situation termed under control

Meanwhile, Vice Chancellor of Health Services Academy Dr Shahzad Ali Khan told Dawn that it was being feared that a large number of people would be infected during Eid shopping at animal markets and during travel across the country to celebrate Eidul Azha in their native places.
“As per my observation, there was less rush in markets this year which has resulted in fewer infections, but the incubation period of the virus is around one week so within the next three days we will witness whether Eidul Azha congregations and animal shopping have led to an increase in the Covid-19 infections,” he said.
“I believe that situation is at present under control as just a few deaths have been reported. The situation of Karachi is a little bit tricky, as the virus grows and spreads in humid environment,” Dr Khan said.

1,"‘Powerful quarters’ opposed EVMs to ‘sway’ results, PTI chief claims","Imran claims ""Mr X and Mr Y "" have been ordered to facilitate the PML-N's victory in the Punjab by-polls.","JHANG: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Wednesday lamented that his efforts to introduce electronic voting machines (EVMs) to ensure transparent polls in Pakistan were scuttled by “powerful quarters”, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), and the major political parties who allegedly endorsed rigging.
“When I was in government, I tried really hard for 2.5 years to introduce EVMs for free and fair polls in Pakistan… [which] would have allowed us to organise transparent elections,” Imran Khan said while addressing a political gathering in Jhang in connection with by-polls on July 17.
The two political families — Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz — ruling Pakistan for the past 35 years opposed these reforms to save their “fake votes”, he claimed. Mr Khan alleged that ECP head Sikandar Sultan Raja also joined hands with these parties against the EVMs even though it was the “job of the ECP to ensure fair polls”.
“And those people who have been in power in this country for quite some time… those who influence the results of election whenever they want to, they also opposed these voting machines,” the former prime minister alleged without naming anyone.

Ex-PM says will defeat turncoat-umpire nexus despite all odds

Taking a dig at the CEC, Mr Khan said the election commissioner should have resigned after the “massively rigged local government elections” in Sindh. He alleged the police did not allow his party candidates to contest on at least 15 per cent of the total seats and that the Sindh election commissioner was allegedly on the payroll of the provincial government.
Imran Khan also criticised the CEC for opposing “open voting” in the Senate election despite instructions from the Supreme Court. He claimed that CEC Raja was also “secretly meeting” PML-N leaders Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz ahead of the by-polls.
The PTI chairman regretted that his party was not busy planning to bring out maximum voters on polling day as should be the case in any developed country but instead it was busy planning how to counter rigging on the day of the election. “We are training our polling agents to block rigging at polling stations with a special focus on polling stations reserved for women,” he added.
Mr Khan, again, referred to ‘Mr X’ and ‘Mr Y’ and said they had been “ordered to facilitate the victory” of the PML-N in the by-election. He claimed that the PTI nominees were not only contesting elections against ‘turncoats’ but were also taking on ‘umpires’ who planned to pave way for the victory of the PML-N candidates.
The PTI chairman said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Hamza Shehbaz were trying to save themselves from corruption cases to the tune of Rs16 billion cases.
Addressing a separate gathering in Jhang City, the PTI chairman warned the establishment against creating hurdles in the way of peaceful protests taken out by the supporters of the PTI. He added if attempts were made to stop the protesters then it could push the country towards anarchy.
In an allusion to the PTI’s long march on May 25, Imran Khan said police officials and Rangers personnel fired tear gas shells and rubber bullets on unarmed protesters. Mr Khan warned that Pakistan could experience a Sri Lanka-like political crisis and added the nation would not forgive those who with the alleged help of the US imposed ‘crooks’ on the country.

2,"PML-Q strives to bring Imran, powers that be on ‘same page’","Stakes are high for Pervaiz Elahi, who is a joint candidate of PTI and PML-Q for the slot of Punjab chief minister.","GUJRAT: Some influential figures in the camp of the Chaudhrys of Gujrat have renewed their efforts to bridge the gap between the head of their ally and ex-premier Imran Khan and the powers that be, ahead of the July 17 vote.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid is using its ‘good offices’ to help the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman and major power players patch up their differences, as the PML-Q leadership considers it absolutely vital to win most of the seats in the by-election to form its government in Punjab that would ultimately pave the way for early general election.
Well-placed sources told Dawn some senior PML-Q figures in the Parvez Elahi camp supporting the PTI were making efforts for a patch-up but no breakthrough had been achieved in this regard.
Stakes are high for Mr Elahi, the Punjab Assembly speaker, who is a joint candidate of PTI and PML-Q for the slot of Punjab chief minister against Hamza Shehbaz of the PML-N.
“We are making hectic efforts for the victory of PTI candidates in the by-polls, as some Gujrat-based Q workers are busy in electioneering for the PTI in Lahore and some other parts of Punjab as per the directions of the senior party leadership,” a senior party leader said.
He claimed that some “other channels are also being explored to ensure PTI-Q victory as this is a do or die for us and Khan Sahib”.
A senior politician and former federal minister Ijazul Haq, who also recently held a special meeting with Mr Khan, Mr Elahi, Fawad Chaudhry and Sheikh Rashid, had already admitted that they had been making efforts for a rapprochement between Mr Khan and the power corridors.
“Now fresh efforts have been launched in this regard. Khan has been told to stop making indirect references to the army chief,” the PML-Q leader disclosed.
Mr Elahi, who had earlier ruled the Punjab province as chief minister in the 2002-07 Gen Musharraf government, “always takes pride in supporting the establishment”.

3,Dispute over construction of mosque in Lahore claims two lives,Complainant says suspects were opposed to the construction of an Ahl-i-Hadith mosque in the area.,"LAHORE: Police in Jaranwala have registered a case over the murder of two men, who were killed in what is said to be a dispute over the construction of a mosque in Faisalabad district.
According to the FIR, Rashid Ali of Chak 97 and his uncle Sardar Ali went to offer Eid prayers to an Ahl-i-Hadith mosque in Chak 97 on July 10. The FIR states that four suspects intercepted them in the bazaar after prayers, while they were accompanied by Rashid’s friend Shahid Farooq alias Qari Shahid.
The suspects, identified as Muhammad Asharaf alias Kashi, Asif, Afzaal and Jameel, pulled out their weapons and shot Qari Shahid in the head and chest, while his friend Rashid Ali was shot trying to save Farooq.
The suspects also kicked the injured victims who were lying on the ground and later fled the scene.
Both victims died on the spot. Police shifted the bodies to the morgue for autopsy and registered a case against four suspects on the complaint of Asif Ali, Rashid’s brother, under section 302, 109, 148, 149 of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The complainant told Dawn that Qari Shahid — who was friends with his brother — had constructed a new mosque in Chak 97 and the suspects had differences with them from some time.
He claimed that Qari Shahid belonged to the Ahl-i-Hadith sect while the suspects belonged to the Barelvi sect, known as Ahl-i-Sunnat.
He said the suspects were opposed to the construction of an Ahl-i-Hadith mosque in the area and this was the reason behind the murder.
Asif Ali said the suspects had tried to stop the construction of the mosque in the past as well, but the matter had been addressed through negotiations.
However, he claimed the suspects harboured a grudge over the issue, which led to the murder of his brother and their friend.
Jaranwala SP Investigation Irtza Komail told Dawn that police were investigating the matter and raids were being made to arrest those involved in the double murder.
The official claimed that police were not certain of the exact motive behind the killings, but said the matter would be investigated from all angles.

4,Women in health sector earn 24pc less than men,"Much of the wage gap is unexplained, perhaps due to discrimination against women.","ISLAMABAD: Women in the healthcare sector face a larger gender pay gap than in other fields, earning 24 per cent less than men, according to a joint report prepared by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The report found a raw gender pay gap of 20 percentage points, but it jumped to 24 percentage points after accounting for factors such as age, education and working time.
Much of the wage gap is unexplained, perhaps due to discrimination against women, even though they account for 67pc of health and care workers worldwide.
The study found that wages tend to be lower overall in the health and care sector than other sectors. This is consistent with the finding that wages often are lower in sectors where women are predominant.
The report, titled ‘The gender pay gap in the health and care sector: a global analysis in the time of Covid-19’, finds that even with the Covid-19 pandemic and the crucial role played by health and care workers, there were only marginal improvements in pay equality between 2019 and 2020.
It also finds a wide variation in gender pay gaps in different countries, suggesting that pay gaps in the sector are not inevitable and that more can be done to close these gaps.

5,Three injured in Hyderabad as tensions rise over man’s death in hotel brawl,Hotel owner accused of killing young man during brawl remanded in police custody.,"HYDERABAD/LARKANA: Tensions remained high in Hyderabad and Jamshoro on Wednesday following the killing of a young man during a brawl at a hotel, and at least three people — including a policeman — received bullet wounds when an unidentified man opened fire.
Earlier on Wednesday, a judicial magistrate had remanded the murder suspect into police custody for two days in connection with the killing of the young man.
Hotel owner Shah Sawar Pathan was produced in court by police and the judge granted a police request for a two-day remand.
He was arrested soon after a scuffle at his restaurant located near Nasim Nagar police post in which 35-year-old Bilal Kaka was killed, while four of his friends were injured. However, the co-accused nominated in the FIR have not yet been arrested.

Hotel owner accused of killing young man during brawl remanded in police custody

Kaka was killed in the scuffle after he was brutally beaten with iron rods. He was laid to rest in the graveyard of Fakir Mohammad Kaka village in New Saeedabad on Tuesday evening. Shah Sawar Pathan, who was arrested after the incident, has also received superficial injuries in the fight.
The incident sparked a backlash after a video went viral showing a police mobile and some policemen present outside the hotel while the scuffle was underway and the sound of gunfire was audible. However, in the footage, the police party remained unmoved. This evoked a strong reaction on social media from activists of nationalist parties who condemned the police indifference.
On Wednesday, groups of young men patrolled different areas of Hyderabad and Jamshoro, forcing tea shops and restaurants run by the Pashtun community to close down. Some shops were ransacked as well, while hotels in the Market Tower and Cantonment areas were shut down.
Later on Wednesday night, someone opened fire after a mob attempted to ransack a shop at Petaro bus stop, Jamshoro.
The injured included policeman Abdul Sattar Qambrani, Shahnawaz Brohi and Kashif Rind. Owned by a member of the Brohi community, the shop was run by a Pashtun.
Separately, Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ahmed Shaikh on Tuesday formally constituted an inquiry committee to assess the response of local police.
The body would determine the role of police officials seen in a video that went viral, where they are seen standing outside a hotel at the time of the brawl.
Separately, the Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM) chairman Sanan Qureshi condemned the murder of Bilal Kaka and appealed to Sindhis to adhere to peace. Addressing at hurriedly called press conference at Larkana Press Club on Wednesday, evening he said a murderer was a murderer and condemned the reaction that erupted in the aftermath of the incident.
Flanked by Momin Samo and Athar Soomro, he said that while they did not oppose others residing on Sindh’s soil, the target killings of labourers could not be tolerated. He said Sindh was already in a difficult situation and questioned the conspiracy that was leading the province down such a path.
Sane voices, including women rights activist and Sindh University teacher Amar Sindhu, rights activist Zulfikar Halepoto and others condemned all attempts to foment ethnic strife in Sindh.

6,ACE to grill Sheikh Rashid in govt fee scandal,"NAB summons Farah Khan in income beyond means, money laundering investigation.","LAHORE: The Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) has launched an investigation against Awami Muslim League chief Sheikh Rashid in connection with a government fee scam and summoned him for Friday (tomorrow).
Mr Rashid, who is considered close to ousted premier Imran Khan, is accused of misappropriation of millions of rupees on account of fee in the sale of state land to Life Residencia Islamabad Housing Society.
The ACE has also summoned the administration of the housing society for investigation.
According to a call-up notice, the former interior minister has been directed to appear before investigators at the ACE headquarters in Lahore on July 15 along with relevant record. “And in case of non-appearance, a unilateral action will be taken against him [Mr Rashid] under 172/174 Pakistan Penal Code,” the notice says.

NAB summons Farah Khan in income beyond means, money laundering investigation

PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz recently hinted at a public rally in Punjab that her party’s government would not spare “Imran Khan and his cronies”.
A source in the PML-N said the PTI government had resorted to political victimisation of its opponents, but the Shehbaz Sharif-led administration would not go to that extend; however, it would certainly not let Imran Khan and his close associates go scot-free on ‘corruption’.
A PTI leader told Dawn that Sheikh Rashid had been on the radar of the PML-N for a long time as its supremo Nawaz Sharif had a personal grudge against him for his attacks on the latter. “I cannot comment on the ACE inquiry against Mr Rashid, but one thing is for sure that he is among those the Sharifs are not going to spare as long they are in power,” he said.
Earlier, the PML-N-led coalition government had also instituted a money laundering case against Moonis Elahi of the PML-Q, another ally of Imran Khan. Mr Moonis had declined the Sharifs’ offer to make his father Chaudhry Parvez Elahi the chief minister of Punjab in return for their (Chaudhrys) support for the no-confidence motion filed in the National Assembly against Imran Khan.
Mr Moonis has been on bail in the case which he terms ‘fake’ instituted on political grounds.
NAB summons Farah Khan
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Lahore on Wednesday summoned Farhat Shahzadi, known as Farah Khan, a close friend of PTI chairman Imran Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi, to appear before it on July 20 in connection with an investigation into income beyond means and money laundering.
NAB also summoned her husband Ahsan Jamil and her business associates and others, including Abdul Majeed, Tariq Mahmoodul Hasan, Muzahir Baig, Munir, Asif, Waqar, Muhammad Fawad, Shandana Awan, Muhammad Naeem, Waqas Riffat, Sajjad Hussain, Ahmad Mansoor, Asad Majeed, Hamid Hameed, Shahzad Ahmad, Muhammad Anwar and Nasir Nawaz, between July 14 and 20 at the NAB Lahore headquarters.
Although the PML-N leadership, especially Maryam Nawaz, has been targeting Farah Khan and Bushra Bibi along with Imran Khan during by-poll campaigns in Punjab for their alleged corruption, practically a corruption reference has yet to be filed by NAB in a court of law against Farah Khan and her associates. The NAB investigation against her is at an inquiry stage.
Punjab Home Minister Attaullah Tarar recently announced plans for seeking “red warrants” to bring Farah Khan back to Pakistan from the UAE where she had gone days before the no-confidence motion succeeded against Imran Khan.
A red notice is an international request sent to the International Criminal Police Organisation (Interpol) seeking the arrest and extradition of an individual.
Interestingly, Mr Tarar had also asked Imran Khan to call Farah Khan back to the country if he (Imran) had a firm belief that she was innocent. “I must say here that Imran is not bringing her back here because she and her husband will become approvers within an hour of their arrest,” he had claimed.
Farah, however, has maintained that she is “innocent” and her ‘media trial’ is carried out to malign the former first lady.

8,"Province faces ‘anti-Punjab Imran’ on Sunday, says Maryam Nawaz","Claims PML-N will bury ‘project to loot, plunder’ Punjab in by-polls.","LAHORE: Addressing a large public gathering as part of the election campaign for the PML-N candidate running for the PP-282 by-poll in Layyah, party vice president Maryam Nawaz said that on July 17, the PML-N would be contesting against the inflation, corruption, incompetence and unemployment brought upon by “Fitna Khan” – a reference to former premier Imran Khan.
She added that Punjab would be facing off against an “anti-Punjab” Khan on Sunday.
At the outset of the rally, Maryam thanked the people of Layyah for turning up in droves. She congratulated PTI defector Lala Tahir Randhawa, who was contesting from the city’s PP-282 constituency in Sunday’s by-polls, saying the crowd at the event and the mood was evident of his victory.
Mentioning CPEC, road, transport and energy projects launched by her father and former premier Nawaz Sharif for Pakistan, Ms Nawaz said PTI chief Imran Khan, on the other hand, had introduced only destructive schemes for Punjab. She claimed Mr Khan was the biggest cause of destruction in the province for which his “front persons were Farah Gogi and his wife Bushra”, and he was the mastermind of the plan. “He says he is doing jihad, but he is the first leader who deployed female members of his family to loot Punjab,” she remarked.

Claims PML-N will bury ‘project to loot, plunder’ Punjab in by-polls

Continuing to jibe at Mr Khan, Ms Nawaz said he had left the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where his party had been in power for nine years, helpless in the wake of the devastation caused by flash floods; its hospitals were inundated, rains had wreaked havoc there, but Imran was busy delivering profanities in Punjab. She asked Mr Khan to go serve the people of the province who were his responsibility. “If God forbid Punjab faces a similar situation, Shehbaz Sharif, Hamza Shehbaz, Maryam Nawaz, everyone will have been at the service of the people,” she remarked.
The PML-N leader further said Imran Khan had once said he had not come to power to check the prices of potato, but now he knew the rates of all edibles. The PML-N would bury the project of loot and plunder in Punjab on July 17, Maryam said, adding good news was the Shehbaz government was going to reduce the prices of petrol and diesel.
She further said Imran had lied about providing 10 million jobs and five million houses to the poor, and instead he rendered people unemployed and shelter-less.
Towards the end, Maryam repeatedly urged the public to vote for her party on Sunday for the sake of the country’s development. She promised development of Layyah district besides creation of new tehsils.

9,GB tourism dept takes flak over ‘delay’ in trekking permits,Tour operators say tourists are cancelling plans to visit K-2 base camp due to delays.,"GILGIT: The tourism department of Gilgit-Baltistan is under fire for its alleged failure to issue trekking permits to at least two dozen foreign tourists who arrived in Skardu to visit the base camps of towering cliffs, including the world’s second-highest mountain K-2.
The K-2 base camp trek is the most popular hike for foreign trekkers as they can visit Baltoro Glacier, Gasherbrum-I, Gasherbrum-II, Broad Peak and K-2 base camps from Concordia.
However, travel agents and tourists have complained that they were not issued permits by the department even though they fulfilled all the requirements.
Tour operator Ghulaam Ahmed said the tourism department was “reluctant to issue trekking permits” and added that tourists had been “waiting for more than one month” to receive permission to start trekking towards the base camps. The long delays in the approval of the permits also resulted in many tourists cancelling their plans, he added.

Tour operators say tourists are cancelling plans to visit K-2 base camp due to delays

“Recently, [at least] 10 foreign tourists who had visited Pakistan for the K-2 base camp trek returned after not getting permits; it was also embarrassing for tour operators as as they couldn’t cater to the demand of their clients,” he added.
Mohammad Ali Nagri, head of Adventure Pakistan, told Dawn that the family of deceased Austrian climber Gerfried Goschl, who died in 2012 on Gasherbrum-I, was waiting for the trekking permits in Skardu so that they could visit the base camp of Gasherbrum-I to honour the memory of the deceased mountaineer.
Goschl’s wife and two daughters aged 11 and 13 wanted to visit the base camp to mark 10 years of the death of their father, but they have not been issued the permits so far. The family has to return on July 26 and if they are not issued trekking permits, it would be quite embarrassing for the tour company and the country.
The family of Goschl contributed to welfare projects in Pakistan as well, he said, adding that the tourism department did not give any reason for the delay in giving permits.
Sajid Hussain, deputy director of the GB tourism department, told Dawn that foreign tourists needed to apply for permits online before coming to Pakistan. The online process doesn’t take much time and in some cases the tourism department has issued permits within three days, he added.
He said when foreign tourists apply for trekking or expedition permits after their arrival they need to do that manually and the process could take up to 28 days. The official added that as per the guidelines, such applications needed to go through security clearance before the issuance of the permits.
‘Missing’ mountaineers return
Meanwhile, two mountaineers Imtiaz Sadpara from Skardu and Hassan Shigri from Shigar arrived at the base camp after a successful summit of Nanga Parbat (8,126m). Mr Sadpara and Mr Shigri were part of an eight-member team that attempted to scale the mountain. However, the foreign mountaineers had returned from camp-3 due to bad weather conditions, while Mr Shigri and Mr Sadpara continued their journey towards the top.
Diamer Deputy Commissioner Fayyaz Ahmed confirmed that the two mountaineers had arrived at the base camp and were in stable condition.
