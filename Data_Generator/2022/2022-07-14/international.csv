“The rate of destruction is faster than the rate of discovery,” says botanist Francisco Farronay, of the National Institute of Amazonian Research (INPA), as he cuts into the bark of an enormous tree and smells its insides.
“It is a race against time.” The largest rainforest on Earth, still largely unexplored by science, is assailed by deforestation for farming, mining and illegal timber extraction.
According to a MapBiomas study last year, the Amazon lost some 74.6 million hectares of native vegetation — an area equivalent to the entire territory of Chile — between 1985 and 2020.
The destruction accelerated under the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, accused by environmentalists of actively encouraging deforestation for economic gain.
The rainforest is considered vital to curbing climate change for its absorption of Earth-warming CO2.
Since 2019, when Bolsonaro took power, average annual deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon increased by 75 percent compared to the previous decade, according to official figures.
“Most plant species in the Amazon are to be found in encroached areas,” said Alberto Vicentini, another member of the expedition launched by Greenpeace.
It is estimated that  “we do not know 60 percent of the tree species, and every time an area is deforested, it destroys a part of the biodiversity that we will never know,” said the INPA scientist.
For their research in this remote part of the northern Brazilian state of Amazonas, the team of took a plane from Manaus, flying over hundreds of kilometers of green forest cut by meandering rivers, to Manicore.
From there, a five-hour boat trip by river for a weeks-long expedition to collect plant samples and observe animal behavior, for which they installed cameras and microphones.
The group includes experts in mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish, trees and flowers. But it is a tough time to be a scientist in Brazil, they say.
“We are living in a moment of science denialism, as we saw with the pandemic in Brazil,” with Bolsonaro railing against masks and vaccines, said Vicentini.
“Research institutions in Brazil are under attack by the policies of this government, universities are suffering many cuts,” he added.
A sheet of newspaper used by one of the botanists in the group to press a flower has the headline:  “Increase in wood extraction in Amazonas” with a photo of two trucks leaving the rainforest loaded with logs.
“There are places where no one has ever been, we have no idea what is there,” said INPA biologist Lucia Rapp Py-Daniel.
“Without the resources to investigate, we do not have the necessary information to even explain why we have to conserve” the area, she said.
Resources have been dwindling for a decade — another phenomenon that has sped up under Bolsonaro, according to critics.

1,UK rail workers announce July 27 strike in pay row,Heathrow tells airlines to stop ticket sales as it caps passengers,"LONDON: British rail workers and station staff will strike this month in disputes over pay and conditions, two unions said, announcing the latest in a growing catalogue of industrial unrest as workers demand wage rises to cope with soaring inflation.
The 24-hour walkout by members of the RMT and TSSA will take place on July 27, the unions said on Wednesday, leaving travellers facing further disruption during the school holidays after tens of thousands of striking workers brought Britain’s rail network close to a standstill last month.
The RMT said Network Rail, the owner and infrastructure manager of most of the rail network in Britain, had made an offer of 4pc, followed by a possible 4pc the following year dependent on staff accepting changes to their contracts.
Inflation in Britain is due expected to rise above 10pc later this year but the government has urged businesses to exercise restraint in pay settlements to avoid fuelling what it says would be an inflationary spiral.

Heathrow tells airlines to stop ticket sales as it caps passengers

“The offer from Network Rail represents a real terms pay cut for our members and the paltry sum is conditional on RMT members agreeing to drastic changes in their working lives,” general secretary Mick Lynch said in statement.
“Strike action is the only course open to us to make both the rail industry and government understand that this dispute will continue for as long as it takes.”  Transport Minister Grant Shapps criticised the union for rejecting the pay offer, saying in a statement that RMT was  “hellbent on causing further misery for people across the country”.
The TSSA said its members in station roles at Avanti West Coast — the west coast mainline operator of routes, including London to Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow — would strike on the same day to coincide with the RMT action.
Separately, the TSSA said 700 of its members working for other rail operators had voted in favour industrial action, but dates had not yet been set.
Earlier this week, other groups of British rail and transport workers also voted in favour of strike action. Staff at airlines and airports have also taken action or are planning walk-outs.
Meanwhile, London’s Heathrow Airport asked airlines to stop selling tickets for summer departures on Tuesday, after it capped the number of passengers flying from the hub at 100,000 a day to limit queues, baggage delays and cancellations.
Britain’s busiest airport, like others across Europe, is struggling to cope as demand rebounds after the pandemic. Heathrow had between 110,000 and 125,000 daily passenger departures in July and August 2019. Airlines at Heathrow had already responded to a government appeal to cut capacity, but the airport said it needed them to go further.
“Some airlines have taken significant action, but others have not, and we believe that further action is needed now to ensure passengers have a safe and reliable journey,” CEO John Holland-Kaye said in an open letter on Tuesday.
“We have therefore made the difficult decision to introduce a capacity cap with effect from 12 July to 11 September.”   “We recognise that this will mean some summer journeys will either be moved to another day, another airport or be cancelled and we apologise to those whose travel plans are affected,” he added.
Heathrow said the average number of outbound seats still remaining in the summer schedules was 104,000 a day, 4,000 above its cap. It said on average 1,500 of these 4,000 seats had been sold to passengers.

2,Trump steps up attacks on Musk for his ‘sail into the sunset’ remarks,Twitter lawsuit accuses US billionaire of contract breach as social network’s shares rise after firm takes long position.,"WASHINGTON/SAN FRAN­CISCO: Donald Trump on Tuesday ratcheted up attacks on Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, after Musk said Trump was too old to become the next US president and Trump needed to  “sail into the sunset.” 
The former US president said Musk would have  “begged” him for government subsidies, in a message on his own social media app, Truth Social.
“When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidised projects, whether it’s electric cars that don’t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he’d be worthless and tell me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said,  “drop to your knees and beg,” and he would have done it,” Trump wrote.
In response, Musk tweeted,  “Lmaooo”.  Musk said on Monday,  “I don’t hate the man, but it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.”  Musk, who previously said he was leaning towards supporting Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for president in 2024, said DeSantis would easily defeat President Joe Biden in the election.
Musk’s remarks were in response to comments Trump made at a political rally on Saturday where he called Musk a  “Bull***t artist” for claiming that he had never voted Republican until this June. He told me he voted for me,” Trump said. In another development, Twitter sued Elon Musk for breaching the $44 billion contract he  signed to buy the tech firm, calling his exit strategy  “a model of  hypocrisy,” court documents showed.

Twitter lawsuit accuses US billionaire of contract breach as social network’s shares rise after firm takes long position

The suit filed in the US state  of Delaware urges the court to order the billionaire to complete his  deal to buy Twitter, arguing that no financial penalty could repair the  damage he has caused.
“Musk’s conduct simply confirms that he  wants to escape the binding contract he freely signed, and to damage  Twitter in the process,” the lawsuit contended.  “Twitter has suffered  and will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a result of defendants’  breaches.” The social media company’s shares edged up slightly in  after-market trading when the news broke.
Legal experts and market  analysts see Twitter as having a strong upper hand heading into court,  Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors.
“This will  be a Game of Thrones battle in court with the fake account/bot issue  front and center, but ultimately Twitter’s board is holding Musk’s feet  to the fire to finish the deal at the agreed upon price,” Ives said.
“Overall  this has been a black eye for Musk and horror movie for Twitter (and  its employees) with no winners since the soap opera began in April.”  After weeks of threats, Musk last week pulled the plug on the deal,  accusing Twitter of  “misleading” statements about the number of fake  accounts, according to a letter from his lawyers included in a US  securities filing.
In his first public remarks since the  announcement, Musk took to Twitter over the weekend to troll the company  after it said it would sue to enforce the deal. “They said I couldn’t buy Twitter. Then they wouldn’t disclose bot info.
Now  they want to force me to buy Twitter in court. Now they have to  disclose bot info in court,” he wrote in a tweet, with included pictures  of Musk laughing with glee.
The termination of the takeover  agreement sets the stage for a potentially lengthy court battle with  Twitter, which initially had opposed a transaction with the  unpredictable billionaire entrepreneur. Twitter has defended its  fake account oversight and has vowed to force Musk to complete the deal,  which contained a $1 billion breakup fee.
Meanwhile, short-seller  Hindenburg Research said on Wednesday it had taken a long position in  Twitter Inc shares, sending the stock up about 8pc, a day after the  social media firm sued Elon Musk for backing out of his $44 billion  deal.
Hindenburg  did not elaborate on the threat the lawsuit poses to Musk, but legal  experts have said that from the information that is public Twitter would  appear to have the upper hand.

3,"Pakistan is second worst country for women, says WEF","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is the second-worst country in terms of gender parity, according to a report released by the...","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is the second-worst country in terms of gender parity, according to a report released by the World Economic Forum (WEF) on Wednesday. 
The Global Gender Gap Report placed Pakistan at the 145th spot in a survey of 146 countries. The only worse performer than Pakistan was Afghanistan.
Pakistan, which has 107 million women, closed at 56.4 per cent in the report’s gender gap index.
The Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran and Chad were the three other countries to figure among the five worst performers. The WEF report determined that Iceland was the best country in the world in terms of gender parity, followed by Finland, Norway, New Zealand, and Sweden, in that order.
On Pakistan, the report observed “this is the highest overall level of parity Pakistan has posted” since the launch of the global gender gap report by WEF in 2006. 
The study praised Pakistan for making “significant improvement” across three sub-indexes, with the highest positive variation on economic participation and opportunity for women. Pakistan was among five countries with a gender gap greater than five per cent. The others were Qatar, Azerbaijan, China and India.
While wage equality carries a higher gender gap score than all other economic indicators, advances were also made vis-à-vis estimated earned income, where women’s earnings rose by four per cent over 2021. However, women’s participation in the workforce declined by 1.9 percentage points.
On educational attainment, gender parity scores for literacy, secondary and tertiary education enrolment showed improvement. The number of male and female students in secondary and tertiary education was higher in 2022 than that in 2021. 
Pakistan ranked 145th in terms of economic participation and opportunity; 135th in educational attainment; 143rd in health and survival; and 95th in political empowerment.
Of the 146 countries covered by the 2022 index, the health and survival gender gap closed by 95.8 per cent, the health and survival gender gap closed by 95.8 per cent, educational attainment by 94.4 per cent, economic participation and opportunity by 60.3 per cent, and political empowerment by 22 per cent.
Although no country has yet achieved full gender parity, the top ten economies have closed at least 80 per cent of their gaps, with Iceland (90.8 per cent) leading the way.
Pakistan was ranked as the second-worst country in South Asia, too. According to the report, Bangladesh is the best country in the region for women, followed by Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Bhutan, India. Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Among the eight regions under spotlight in the report, South Asia ranks the lowest, with only 62.3 per cent of the gender gap closed. The lack of progress since the last edition extends the wait in South Asia to close the gender gap to 197 years. South Asia recorded low scores across all measured gender gaps and little progress was made in most countries since the last edition. 
The economic gender gap closed by 1.8 per cent, with increases in the share of women in professional and technical roles, especially in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
On the other hand, the share of women in professional and technical roles fell in Pakistan and the Maldives. 
South Asia ranks second lowest on the educational attainment sub-index, above just sub-Saharan Africa. Literacy rate, one of the core indicators for education, saw no change in five countries. The study found that South Asia has one of the lowest regional gender parity scores for health and survival, at 94.2 per cent. 
In this sub-index, only Sri Lanka closed its gender gap, while Afghanistan, Pakistan and India were the worst-performing countries globally.  Sex ratio at birth remains relatively low in large, populated countries such as India and Pakistan, whereas Bangladesh, Bhutan and Sri Lanka have reached parity.
South Asia has the fourth-highest regional performance on the political empowerment sub-index, having achieved 26.3 per cent of gender parity, 0.7 percentage points lower over the 2021 edition.

4,"Russia, Ukraine put heads together to solve grain crisis",High-stakes meeting held in Istanbul; talks come with threat of food shortages spreading across parts of the world.,"ISTANBUL: Russia and Ukraine met UN and Turkish officials on Wednesday in a bid to break a months-long impasse over grain exports that has seen food prices soar and millions face hunger.
The high-stakes meeting in Istanbul came with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine showing no signs of abating and the sides locked in a furious long-range shooting battle that is destroying towns and leaving people with nothing.
Ukrainian officials said at least five people were killed in Russian shelling on the region surrounding the Black Sea port city of Mykolaiv.
“You can’t run away from war and you never know where it will find you,” 60-year-old agronomist Lyubov Mozhayeva said, while picking up a humanitarian food package in the partially destroyed frontline city of Bakhmut.
The first face-to-face talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations since another meeting in Istanbul on March 29 comes with the threat of food shortages spreading across the poorest parts of the world. Ukraine is a vital exporter of wheat and grains such as barley and maize.
It has also supplied nearly half of all the sunflower oil traded on global markets.
But shipments across the Black Sea have been blocked by Russian warships and mines Kyiv has laid to avert a feared amphibious assault.
‘Two steps from agreement’
The Istanbul negotiations are being complicated by growing suspicions that Russia is trying to export grain it has stolen from Ukrainian farmers in regions under its control. US space agency data released last week showed 22 percent of Ukraine’s farmland falling under Russian control since the February 24 invasion.
The two sides say they have made progress but are sticking to firm demands that could collapse the talks.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dm­­ytro Kuleba said Kyiv was  “two steps from an agreement with Russia”.
“We are in the final stages and everything now depends on Russia,” he told Spain’s El Pais newspaper. Russia said its requirements included the right to  “search the ships to avoid the contraband of weapons” — a demand rejected by Kyiv.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres tried on Tuesday to play down expectations of an imminent breakthrough.
“We are working hard indeed, but there is still a way to go,” the UN chief told reporters.
Grain corridors
Nato member Turkey has been using its good relations with both the Kremlin and Kyiv to try and broker an agreement on a safe way to deliver the grain.
Turkey says it has 20 merchant ships waiting in the region that could be quickly loaded and sent to world markets.
A plan by the UN proposes the ships follow safe  “corridors” that run between the known location of mines. Kyiv has also asked that its vessels be accompanied by warships from a friendly country such as Turkey.
Experts say de-mining the Black Sea is a complex operation that could take months — too long to address the growing global food crisis.
Kuleba said he did not think Moscow actually wanted to reach an agreement because proceeds from grain sales would help support a Western-backed government in Kyiv that the Kremlin brands as  “Nazis”.
“They know that if we start to export, we will get proceeds from world markets, and this will make us stronger,” Kuleba said.
The talks in Istanbul precede a meeting in Tehran next Tuesday between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
The war in Ukraine has contributed to Turkey’s mounting economic problems and further complicated Erdogan’s path to a third decade in power in elections due within the next year.
Erdogan’s ultimate goal is to bring Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky down to Istanbul for talks aimed at pausing the fighting and launching formal peace talks.
But the Ukrainian army warned this week that Russia was preparing to stage its heaviest attack yet on the Donetsk region — the larger of the two areas comprising the Donbas war zone. The Russian army has not conducted any major ground offensives since taking the last points of Ukrainian resistance in the war zone’s smaller Lugansk region at the start of the month.
Analysts believe the Russians are taking an  “operational pause” during which they are rearming and regrouping forces before launching an assault on Sloviansk and Kramatorsk — Ukraine’s administrative centre for the east.
Ukraine is trying to counter the Russians by staging increasingly potent attacks with new US and European rocket systems targeting arms depots. US officials believe the Russians are trying to recoup their losses by negotiating to acquire hundreds of combat drones from Iran.

5,Western Europe wilts under heatwave,Large parts of the Iberian Peninsula have seen temperatures surpassing 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) this week.,"BORDEAUX: France and Britain suffered soaring temperatures on Wednesday, edging closer to the blistering heat already engulfing Spain and Portugal as wildfires destroyed vast stretches of Western European forestland.
Large parts of the Iberian Peninsula have seen temperatures surpassing 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) this week.
In southwestern France a wildfire raging since Tuesday had ripped through 1,000 hectares of pine trees just south of Bordeaux by Wednesday, prompting the evacuation of 150 residents from their homes.
Near the Dune of Pilat — Europe’s tallest sand dune — another fire consumed about 700 hectares of old pine trees, authorities said, with the blaze still not contained.
Regional prefect Fabienne Buccio told reporters that fires were spread out over five kilometres (three miles), fuelled by dried-out vegetation.
About 6,000 campers near the dune were evacuated as firefighters worked through the night on the sandy terrain. Further inland, 500 people were evacuated around the village of Guillos as their homes came under threat from advancing fire.
Some 600 firefighters have been battling the blazes in the region, aided by waterbomber aircraft. Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne warned that the heat, forecast to last 10 days,  “affects people’s health very quickly, especially that of the most vulnerable”.
Some cities, like Toulouse and Lourdes, have made changes to their Bastille Day celebrations programmes on Thursday to limit the risk of accidental fire, while Nimes cancelled the traditional fireworks altogether.
The prefect of the Paris region, meanwhile, cut the speed limit on motorways and expressways to limit air pollution.
“We do expect it to worsen,” World Meteo­rological Organi­sation spokeswoman Clare Nullis said. “Accompanying this heat is drought,” she said. It had also been  “a very bad season for the glaciers”, she said.

He had disclosed the decision in an exclusive interview earlier this month, explaining he wanted to give women more senior and influential positions in the Holy See.
The three women are sister Raffaella Petrini, an Italian who is currently the deputy governor of the Vatican City, French nun Yvonne Reungoat, a former superior general of a religious order, and Italian lay woman Maria Lia Zervino, president of the World Union of Catholic Women’s Organisations, UMOFC.
The three women were among 14 people appointed to the Dicastery for Bishops, which vets candidates and advises the pope on which priests should become bishops.
The other 11 appointed on Wednesday were cardinals, bishops and priests. Terms last for five years. Before Wednesday’s announcement of the 14 names, there were more than 20 members. The total fluctuates as terms expire but usually the committee numbers between about 25-30.
The process starts locally where bishops suggest to archbishops the names of priests they think would make good bishops.
The list then goes to the Vatican nuncio, or ambassador, in a country, who further investigates the person and sends his recommendations to the Vatican. The members of the committee, who come from around the world, meet in Rome about twice a month and send their recommendations to the pope, who makes the final decision.
“This way, things are opening up a bit,” Pope Francis said in the July 2 interview in his residence, when he disclosed his decision to name women to the decision-making part of the bishops department.

More than 90 red alerts, the most severe in a three-rung warning system, were active across China as of 3:30pm. Most were in the Yangtze basin, which spans nearly 2,000 km (1,200 miles).
Shanghai, China’s commercial capital, issued its second red alert in four days, warning of temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Construction and other outdoor activities are required to be reduced or even halted under a red alert, historically very rare for the city of 25 million.
China is gearing up for a summer of extremes this year, from scorching heatwaves to prolonged downpours. Cities south of the Yangtze in particular have been hit by both intense heat and record-breaking precipitation.

8,Former bosses of Fukushima operator ordered to pay $97bn damages,TOKYO: A Tokyo court on Wednesday ordered former executives from the operator of the devastated Fukushima nuclear...,"TOKYO: A Tokyo court on Wednesday ordered former executives from the operator of the devastated Fukushima nuclear plant to pay 13.32 trillion yen ($97 billion) for failing to prevent the disaster, plaintiffs said.
Four ex-bosses from the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) were ordered to pay the damages in a suit brought by shareholders over the nuclear disaster triggered by a massive tsunami in 2011.
Plaintiffs emerged from the Tokyo court holding banners reading  “shareholders win” and  “responsibility recognised”. Lawyers for the plaintiffs hailed the ruling, and said they believed it to be the largest amount of compensation ever awarded in a civil lawsuit in Japan.
“Nuclear power plants can cause irreparable damage to human lives and the environment,” the plaintiffs said in a separate statement after the ruling.
“Executives for firms that operate such nuclear plants bear enormous responsibility, which cannot compare with that of other companies.” The shareholders argued that the disaster could have been prevented if TEPCO bosses had listened to research and carried out preventative measures like placing an emergency power source on higher ground. Defendants said the studies they were not credible and the risks unpredictable.

9,Sri Lanka’s ‘Terminator’ president escapes from protesters baying for blood,"He was considered the architect of ""white van"" abductions under Mahinda.","COLOMBO: Known as  “The Terminator” to family and foes alike for his ruthless crushing of Tamil rebels to end a decades-long civil war, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s rule is drawing to a close with him a fugitive and his island’s economy in ruins.
Rajapaksa, one of a clan of four brothers who have dominated the country’s politics in recent years, was defence secretary under his brother Mahinda’s Rajapaksa’s presidency from 2005-15.
He denied allegations that at least 40,000 minority Tamil civilians were killed by troops under his command during the closing months of the war, but the accusations bolstered his tough-guy image in the eyes of the majority Sinhalese.
He was also considered the architect of  “white van” abductions under Mahinda, when dissidents and journalists were grabbed in unmarked vehicles and disappeared, allegedly the victims of extrajudicial killings. He made no bones about winning the 2019 elections with the overwhelming support of his own majority Sinhala-Buddhist community.
For Sri Lanka’s influential Buddhist clergy he was the reincarnation of Sinhalese warrior king Dutugemunu the Great, who is known for vanquishing a Tamil ruler.
Dutugemunu reigned for 24 years, but Rajapaksa fled less than three years into his rule — and a resignation would make him Sri Lanka’s shortest-lived directly elected president.
The 73-year-old leader flew to the neighbouring Maldives on Wednesday, four days after his presidency crumbled and tens of thousands of protesters overran his official residence.
That came after months of demonstrations demanding his resignation over an economic crisis, triggered by the coronavirus pandemic but exacerbated by mismanagement.
The former soldier marketed his lack of political expertise as a virtue but Tamil legislator Dharmalingam Sithadthan said what Rajapaksa projected as his strength was actually his weakness. “His lack of political knowledge showed in the way he worked,” Sithadthan said.  “He flip-flopped from one crisis to another. He thought by simply issuing orders things would materialise.
“Every time I met with him, he would say he is focused on the economy and law-and-order, but he failed in both.” 
Rajapaksa came to power on a manifesto promising  “Vistas of Prosperity and Splendour”, but according to the UN the country now desperately needs humanitarian aid.
The coronavirus pandemic hammered tourism and overseas remittances — both mainstays of the economy — leaving it facing a foreign exchange crisis.
Lengthy power cuts are in place as the country does not have dollars to import oil for generators, the nation’s 22 million people have been enduring acute shortages of food, fuel and medicines since late last year, and poverty is spreading.

10,Italian farmers suffer worst locust invasion in over 30 years,MILAN: When farmer Rita Tolu saw  “a big black wave storming across the horizon and taking over the fields” in...,"MILAN: When farmer Rita Tolu saw  “a big black wave storming across the horizon and taking over the fields” in April, she knew that little of her dried fodder and alfalfa crops would be left in the following days.
Tolu, 40, and other farmers working the central areas of the Italian island of Sardinia have seen swarms of billions of locusts ravage their land in the worst such invasion for more than three decades.
The invasion is projected to affect an area of around 60,000 hectares this year, double that of 2021 and compared with just 2,000 hectares in 2019.
Tolu said that many of her colleagues  “might have to shut down their businesses” as the plague of locusts adds to the impact of drought and rising fuel costs on farmers.
She and her family run a dairy farm of 200 hectares near the village of Noragugume, where crops and animal fodder such as ryegrass and clovers are also grown and around 1,000 sheep graze.
This year, Tolu was able to collect just 200 stacks of hay against 1,000 in 2021, she said, with some of it harvested early as a precaution and losing some of its nutritional quality.
“Here people farm the land to avoid purchasing fodder and other animal feeds,” said Rita Zaru, the mayor of Noragugume, where over 70pc of the around 280 inhabitants are employed in farming and shepherding.
Zaru said that anyone who had opted to farm grassland this year to boost milk production had lost the whole of their initial investment because of the locusts.
The problem is not new in Sardinia. In 1946, about 1.5 million hectares of land, accounting for two-thirds of the island’s territory, were affected as locusts spread quickly across fields abandoned during World War Two.
Ignazio Floris, who teaches General and Applied Entomology at Sardinia’s Sassari University, said depopulation and uncultivated lands were once again one of the main reasons behind this kind of natural event.
Rising temperatures and lack of rain also play a big role as dry and compacted soil makes it easier for locusts to lay their eggs. Floris noted that this year’s invasion has been affecting an area equal to 2-3pc of the island, a swathe of territory that is much smaller compared to the 1946 catastrophe or 1988-89, when 81,000 hectares were hit.
The outlook is uncertain but Floris does not expect locusts to multiply as rapidly in 2023 in the light of planned remedies such as ploughing more fields and the deployment of a specific type of beetle that feeds on the locust’s eggs.
