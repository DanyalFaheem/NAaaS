1,"NAB defies ban, transfers 13 officials in Punjab","Additional director, who raided Hamza’s house in 2019, among those reshuffled","LAHORE: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Wednesday transferred 13 officers including the one who had raided the house of then opposition leader in Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz on charges of money laundering and income beyond means.  
Besides, the NAB also transferred and posted the senior officers in spite of the Election Commission’s ban on the same in the districts where by-polls are being held.
Additional Director NAB Lahore Muhammad Asghar has been transferred to (NAB) Sukkur. Mr Ashghar in April, 2019 had raided the Model Town residence of the Shehbaz family to arrest Hamza but returned after facing resistance from his security guards and party workers.
Following its failed bid to arrest Hamza, the NAB had filed an application with police to register an FIR against his guards for interference in state’s function and requested the interior ministry to put his name on the no-fly list which it later entertained.

Addl director, who raided Hamza’s house in 2019, among those reshuffled

The NAB is currently headed by its acting chairman following the departure of retired Justice Javed Iqbal on June 3. Mr Iqbal had relinquished the charge after the expiry of a recently promulgated ordinance which had allowed him to stay in office until the appointment of a new chief.
The previous government of PTI had promulgated the ordinance to extend the NAB chief’s tenure for an indefinite period.
The incumbent Shehbaz government has yet to initiate the process of appointing the new NAB chief despite having a ‘friendly’ opposition leader in the National Assembly Raja Riaz. Under the law the NAB chairman is appointed in consultation with the prime minister and the opposition leader.
Sources believe since the nine-party coalition government had got a bill passed in the National Assembly which made the watchdog, as described by PTI leaders, `toothless’, it is in no hurry to rush for the new appointment. 
On Wednesday, the NAB acting chairman transferred and posted 12 additional directors and one deputy director. The additional directors – Mufti Abdul Haq, Aftab Ahmad, Muhammad Asghar, Nadeem Ahmed Shahid, Khawar Ilyas, Shahzadas Imtiaz Ahmad, Haroon Rasheed, Zahir Shah, Faisal Qureshi, Hina Saeed, Omar Khan and Tariq Khan, from Islamabad to Lahore, Lahore to Karachi, Lahore to Sukkur, Lahore to Islamabad, Lahore to Balochistan, Karachi to Islamabad, Karachi to KP, KP to Multan, Balochistan to Rawalpindi, Balochistan to Islamabad, Multan to Rawalpindi, and Sukkur to Lahore, respectively.
Deputy Director Saleem Ahmad Khan has been transferred and posted from Rawalpindi to Balochistan. 
The NAB’s transfers and postings have come at the heels of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP)’s warning. Last week, the ECP had taken notice of the postings and transfers in the NAB and ordered cancellation of the same at once. The ECP had told the NAB that it had banned any transfers and postings in the districts where the by-polls were being held. In Lahore, Multan, Rawalpindi by-polls on the Punjab Assembly seats are taking place and NAB has transferred and posted the officers of these districts in violation of its (ECP) directive.

2,Hamza boasts his desire to be part of canvassing,Says alliance between PML-N and PPP was not for making a government but they had united for the national cause.,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz said on Wednesday had the PML-N allowed him, he would have resigned and joined the campaign for the by-elections.  
He told a press conference after his meeting with South Punjab’s PPP president Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood at Model Town that some Punjab ministers resigned from their offices to join the electioneering for the PML-N candidates for 20 seats.  
Highlighting the importance of the contest, he said he too could have join hands with them by resigning from his office as the election code of conduct barred the public office-holders from running the campaigns of any candidate. But, he said, his party didn’t allow him to resign and join the campaign.  
Referring to the alliance between the PML-N and the PPP, Hamza said it was not for making a government but they had united for the national cause. He hoped that the alliance would win popularity from the people and the ruling coalition would achieve success on all 20 seats.  
He said the ruling alliance would not do vindictive politics the way Imran Niazi did, after the victory and would jointly work to improve the national economy.  
Criticising Usman Buzdar for failing to serve the masses, he said heaps of garbage would be found in the streets of Lahore and other Punjab towns during the past four years but cleanliness remained exemplary across the province on Eid (after he took over on April 16). He said havoc was played with the province in the name of Waseem Akram-plus as Farah Gogi and Ahsan Jameel looted Punjab ruthlessly.  
He said he worked for the welfare of the masses even though his cabinet could not be formed for two months (for certain reasons). He said he chalked out a programme to provide subsidised flour and 100 units of electricity free to the masses for the first time in the history of the country.  
He thanked PPP leaders Asif Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for supporting his government and promised not to leave any stone unturned in making the people prosperous with the help of the allies. 
“No single party can change the destiny of the country and we all have to work together. We will have to do away with hatred in order to take the country forward,” he said.  
Former governor Makhdoom Ahmad Mahmood said both the PPP and the PML-N gave a final shape to the strategy with regard to the July 17 by-elections and said the two parties had unanimity of views. He hoped for good results in the by-polls because of the joint strategy, particularly in South Punjab.  
Endorsing Hamza’s views, he said a great amount of effort would be required to rectify the shortcomings created in the last four years in the country. “We developed a consensus that we have to think for the country by putting politics aside.”
Earlier, CM Hamza Shehbaz held a meeting with the former governor in which matters pertaining to mutual interest, current political situation and a joint by-poll strategy came under discussion.
Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Khwaja Ahmad Hasaan, Khwaja Salman Rafique, Khwaja Imran Nazir, Syed Hassan Murtaza, Makhdoom Usman Ahmad and others were also present.

3,‘FC personnel from KP’ held at PTI corner meeting,LAHORE: The Factory Area police claim to have arrested an armed man during a raid on a corner meeting arranged by ...,"LAHORE: The Factory Area police claim to have arrested an armed man during a raid on a corner meeting arranged by the PTI candidate for PP-168 constituency, who turned out to be a personnel of the Frontier Constabulary (FC) of the Khyber Pakthunkhwa (KP). 
He was later identified as Ahmad Nawaz, a resident of Mansehra. The matter has been referred to the Punjab police and the government high-ups.
In a video statement recorded in police custody, the FC personnel claimed that he was sent to Lahore by the KP government and the FC Commandant to discharge duty as a ‘guard’ of the PTI candidate Nawaz Awan.
He said he was a serving personnel of the KP FC and the PTI candidate for the PP-168 constituency of Lahore was a relative of his ‘boss’.
Lahore Operations DIG retired Capt Sohail Chaudhry told Dawn the police team, including a DSP and the SHO of the Factory Area police, raided the ‘corner meeting’ of the PTI candidate near the Punjab Housing Society, acting on an emergency call about the “presence of some armed men” there.
He said the PTI candidate and other leaders, who were present in the meeting, offered resistance during the raid and misbehaved with the DSP and the SHO when they asked them to hand over the “armed men” to the police.
Despite fierce resistance, the police managed to take one of the armed men in custody, who later introduced himself as a constable of the FC belonging to KP.
However, the DIG said, the man later changed his statement saying he was a “retired” official of the FC.
He said the PTI candidate facilitated the other armed men in fleeing the corner meeting.  
The police have lodged a case, the DIG added.
Later, in a statement, provincial home minister and spokesperson for Punjab government Attaullah Tarar alleged that the KP government was sending armed men to Punjab to sabotage by-elections.
He said the Punjab government would foil the “nefarious designs” of the PTI’s KP government and a case would be lodged against the FC man arrested in Lahore.

APAT secretary-general Naeem Mir along with other trader leaders told a press conference here on Wednesday that they could not forget [ill effects of the] over three-year performance of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government in which the trading community was taken as a foe by the PTI leaders.
Claiming that restoration of the economy and prosperity of traders were associated with the PML-N government, he said they would fully support the N-League’s candidates in the by-polls in Punjab.
He said PML-N like-minded traders were already running election campaigns of the PML-N’s aspirants and others would join now.
He said social media and publicity campaigns of these candidates would also be run, while their corner meetings would also be organised.
Mr Mir said the traders would also perform their duties at the polling day election camps and would also make efforts to bring voters from their homes to polling stations as well as serving as polling agents.
He said they had taken the decision because Punjab could ill-afford another Buzdar term in power.
The trader leader criticised former prime minister Imran Khan for what he said, misleading the nation and wasting its time on the corruption narrative and now attempting to build a narrative of freedom from foreign interference in the internal affairs of the country.
Those present at the presser included Suhail Mahmood Butt, Saifur Rehman, Shahid Nazeer, Mian Khalil Umair, Rizwan Butt, Malik Naeem, Zulfiqar Bhatti, Mian Riaz, Ashfaq Butt and others.

5,Minor domestic help’s torture: Lahore police add new section to FIR to ensure convictions,"Official says law deals with offence, committed by a person taking care of children, relating to the ""cruelty to a child"".","LAHORE: On the recommendation of a high-powered panel comprising Lahore investigation police officers, a recently-amended section — 328-A — of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), titled “cruelty to a child” has been added to a torture case wherein two minor brothers working as domestic help were brutally tortured by their employers, resulting in death of one of the siblings in Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Monday last.
The offence was added to the already registered first information report (FIR) on the pattern of the case against a former additional sessions judge, Raja Khurram Ali Khan and his wife. The couple involved in the ‘Tayyaba case' was booked for torturing a housemaid in Islamabad in 2017. The ex-judge and his wife were accused of burning the hands of their 10-year-old domestic help Tayyaba on stove, besides subjecting her to inhuman torture.
Tayyaba case was highlighted when the images of the bruised minor girl went viral on social media, prompting the Supreme Court of Pakistan to take suo moto action. In this case, the Raja Khurram and his wife were handed down three-year imprisonment and Rs500,00 fine.
The case of brutal torture of two minor brothers in DHA Lahore was reported on the second day of Eid-ul-Azha (Monday). In this incident, one of the siblings Kamran (10) was allegedly tortured to death and his younger brother Rizwan (6) was injured critically by their employers for “stealing food” from their fridge.
Several deep bruises inflicted with “sharp-edged objects” and iron rods were found on the bodies of the minor siblings when their employers shifted them to a private hospital in the DHA.
“Given the scale of the brutality the employers committed in the case, we have added a newly-introduced section -- 328-A -- of the PPC in the FIR lodged against the suspects”, a senior police officer told Dawn. He said the decision in this respect was taken by a panel of senior officers headed by Lahore investigation DIG Kamran Adil.
He said section 328-A was introduced while making amendments to the PPC in 2016 declaring such offence non-bailable. The section deals with an offence (committed by any person taking care of the children) relating to the ‘cruelty to a child’.
The new section did not mention the age of the child concerned, he said, adding that its provisions suggest the sentence should not be less than a year and might be extended to three years if the offender willfully assaults, mistreats, neglects, abandons or carries out an act of omission that has the potential to harm or injure a child by causing physical or psychological injury to the child.
Earlier, the police had been using the PPC section 328 against the offenders in the FIRs dealing with child torture incidents that mentioned up to 12-year age of the victim, the police official said, adding that the amended PPC section covers all individuals below 18-years and any offender, without considering his/her relation to the victim.  
He said the Lahore police applied section 328-A of the PPC to the extent of six-year-old Rizwan, who was injured because of torture by his employers.
“We applied the PPC section 328-A in addition to hurt offences declared in the Medico Legal Certificate (MLC) of the injured domestic worker”, he said.
For this, the Lahore police officers sought help of the provincial prosecution department in order to make a strong case against the suspects, to ensure their conviction by the court, the police official said, adding that the three of the suspects, including head of the family Nasrullah, his son Hassan and a woman Shabana, had already been arrested, while raids are on for the two others.
A team of senior police officers headed by Lahore investigation SSP was dealing with the case in order to ensure exemplary punishment to the offenders from the court of law, he added.

As per initial police investigations, 10-year-old Tayyab was kidnapped at gunpoint by a notorious gang of pickpockets who had been blackmailing the boy.  
According to a police official privy to the investigation, the boy had been working for the gang in the past, but a couple of months back he discontinued his criminal activities.  
However, he said, the gang members were in contact with the boy for the last several months and had been blackmailing Tayyab and forcing him to either start working for them again, or pay them a hefty amount as “compensation”.
The officer says the boy used to steal belongings of other children visiting a video game shop in the street where he lived with his parents.
He said the police extended the scope of investigations into the incident when it transpired that many other children had also been trapped by the same gang.
The officer said the gang kidnapped Tayyab when he refused to revive his nexus with the criminals.  
He claimed that on knowing about police’s vigorous search for the kidnapped boy, the criminals left Tayyab on a road and fled away.
He said the close-up shots of the kidnappers, obtained from the CCTV cameras footage, got matched with the police record, revealing they were habitual criminals.
The boy has been handed over to his parents, the police official said, adding that the kidnappers would be arrested soon.

At a news conference at the Punjab Assembly on Wednesday, he claimed the ECP could decide about disqualifying the turncoats in a matter of couple of days because it was supposed to implement the principles laid down by the Supreme Court.
He said the PML-N decision to give tickets to PTI turncoats had disappointed the Muslim League’s genuine workers and they were showing least interest in the elections, and added the polls had become a one-sided affair for the PTI. For the election campaign, he said, the PML-N leadership had to get resignations from half of the cabinet because it was not satisfied with the campaign by Maryam.
He said the MQM and BAP would say goodbye to the PML-N-led government on July 23 to eventually topple this government by July 30.  
Former governor Omer Sarfraz Cheema chided the civil administration and police for raiding a corner meeting of PTI candidate Malik Nawaz Awan. It’s a clear-cut violation of Hamza’s promise in the Supreme Court, he said. He stressed that the ECP should take notice of violence in by-election constituencies and registration of fake cases by police against the PTI leaders.
The former minister said police were acting at the behest of the PML-N and registered a case against PTI candidate Moazzam Jatoi in Muzaffargarh and harassed Yasir Jatoi besides political workers joining the PTI in Jhang, Layyah and Bhakkar. 
He said the Establishment should beware that Rana Sanaullah and Atta Tarar were doing illegal activities and rigging but eventually shift the blame on state institutions. He also chided Rana Sana over his comment that the CNICs of those persons who would chant “lotay” (turncoats) or “chorr” (thieves) slogans against the PML-N leaders would be blocked.
“Rana Sana would need to block CNICs of all Pakistanis because everyone in the country is chanting these slogans,” he said.
He said the PTI had also filed a petition challenging pre-poll rigging before the ECP. He said Hamza was sticking to the chief minister secretariat just to use government vehicles and petrol.
“It is time that the state institutions and elite let the ‘soft revolution’ come through the votes of the people because any blockade would result in ‘hard revolution’,” he said. 
He said Pakistan did not see Sri Lanka-like situation because Imran Khan played an active role as opposition leader, which was not a case in Sri Lanka. He welcomed PML-N’s decision to lower petrol prices because it would serve as a relief for the public.  
Earlier, Fawad Chaudhry and Omer Cheema called on Punjab Assembly Speaker Parvez Elahi and discussed the situation of the by-elections in 20 constituencies.
Elahi said the PML-N until yesterday was chanting the slogan “Respect the Vote” but now brazenly chanting the slogan “Vote for the Turncoats”. He said the people now knew the reality of imposters like Shehbaz. For the first time in the history, he said, the government had not found a candidate against the opposition.  
Chaudhry said the arrests in the by-election constituencies were a sign of government’s bewilderment.

The security plan was prepared for the 466 polling stations and 1,470 polling booths which will be set up in 189 buildings in four constituencies of the city.
CCPO Bilal Siddique Kamyana said several teams have been formed while issuing directions to provide peaceful atmosphere for the protection of voters, supporters and the candidates.
He said as many as 817 teams of Dolphin Squad, Police Response Unit and 13 others of Elite Force have been formed for patrolling around the polling stations. Moreover, 378 special posts would also be set up to check entry of the vehicles. 
He said more than 750 Anti-Riot Force personnel would also ensure law and order on this occasion.
“The polling stations in the four constituencies have been divided into sensitive and highly sensitive categories,” he said.
Accordingly, at least two upper subordinates and 10 constables each would be deputed at most sensitive polling stations whereas two subordinates and eight constables would be deployed at other sensitive polling stations.
He has directed the police officers to ensure law and order, security and logistical arrangements in view of the sensitivity of the by-elections.
He also directed them to pay frequent visits to the polling station buildings, surrounding areas, returning officers’ camp offices and the duty points in order to complete all necessary arrangements before July 17.
“The installation of CCTV cameras for monitoring in and around polling station buildings, barbed wires for security, metal detectors, walk-through gates, ladies search cabin and other security and logistics arrangements must be finalised well before time,” he added.
He also issued directions to the police officials to remain in constant liaison with all stakeholders including the district returning officer, monitoring and presiding officers, district administration and the candidates during the election campaign and polling process to ensure peace and to avoid any untoward incident.
No delay would be accepted in any case in taking action against the elements who would cause possible chaos, disorder and provocation on the polling day and during election campaign.
In addition to the safe delivery of the relevant material to the polling stations and camp offices of the district returning officers, the deputed police personnel would be on high alert till the vote counting process is completed. He said display of weapons had been prohibited under Section 144 imposed by the home department and police would ensure implementation in letter and spirit.

11,Compensation suit: High court rejects MDA plea,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has observed that a suit for recovery of compensation is maintainable when a property...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has observed that a suit for recovery of compensation is maintainable when a property is acquired unlawfully or possessed without due process of acquisition and payment under the Land Acquisition Act 1894.  
The Multan Development Authority (MDA) filed a civil revision petition before the court challenging two decisions by district courts wherein the authority was ordered to pay compensation to a person for illegally acquiring his property.  
The individual pleaded that the authority had no right to construct a road without acquiring the property and payment of adequate compensation. It was alleged that the property was utilised by the MDA during the construction of a road after demolishing the wall of the house in defiance of a stay order.  
It was argued that the authority without carrying out acquisition proceedings and payment of compensation deprived the owner of his property.  
Dismissing the petition of the MDA, Justice Abid Hussain Chattha observes that the evaluation of the record proves that no acquisition proceedings were carried out by the authority regarding construction of the road. He notes that it was proved by the respondent (owner) that his property measuring seven kanal, two marla and 13 yards was utilised in the construction of the road which had not been acquired.  
The judge says the assertion regarding demolition of the boundary wall of the house also proved. He further says the MDA also could not conclusively establish its right to build a road on land not owned by it or the government without acquisition or compensation in the notified area.  
The judge observes that the respondent had been deprived of due compensation since the initiation of the litigation in 1989. He says the decision to refer the matter to the collector for determination of due compensation would therefore, be unjust, unfair and in violation of the fundamental right of the respondent.
He observes it would tantamount to give a licence to the government or its instrumentalities to forcibly acquire properties without following due process of law.  
The judge rules that where an acquiring agency usurps the right of a person by forcibly occupying his property, the aggrieved person may bring a suit for recovery of compensation in line with the principles of determination of compensation under the Land Acquisition Act since there is no mechanism to trigger the provisions of the Act to seek compensation after a forcible possession and consumption of property.
