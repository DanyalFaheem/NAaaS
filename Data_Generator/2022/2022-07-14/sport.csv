0,Vingegaard seizes Tour de France lead with soaring mountain triumph,Pogacar had the class to fist-bump Vingegaard at the finish line and was also big enough to face the media immediately.,"SERRE CHEVALIER: Jonas Vingegaard climbed into the Tour de France overall lead in a mountain stage win for the ages on Wednesday as defending champion Tadej Pogacar wilted in the sizzling heat and cracked with the soaring heights.
On the day, Dane Vingegaard finished 59sec ahead of Colombian climber Nairo Quintana while Frenchman Romain Bardet was third at 1min 10sec atop the final climb to 2,413m altitude.
An exhausted Pogacar looked broken as he crossed the line seventh, 2min 51sec adrift at the summit of the 9.2 percent, 11.5km ascent of the Col du Granon in the southern Alps.
Pogacar had the class to fist-bump Vingegaard at the finish line and was also big enough to face the media immediately. 
“Suddenly I didn’t feel well. It wasn’t my day, but I’ll keep fighting,” promised the 2020 and 2021 champion Pogacar who lost two teammates to Covid-19 this week.
Pogacar dropped from first to third at 2min 22sec, after looking fine even half way up the final challenge.
Vingegaard now leads Team DSM’s Bardet by 2min 16sec in the overall standings after he also soared on a tough, baking day.
Looking pale himself, Vingegaard expressed surprise at the extent of his triumph. 
“Tadej is an enormous rider, the best in the world, he’s won it twice, so to take the yellow off him like this is unthinkable,” said Vingegaard, who hinted Thursday’s proceedings could provide further drama. 
“It’s looking good for the upcoming stages, the plan was always to pile on the pressure on these two days,” he added.
It was a first ever Tour stage win for Vingegaard, who finished runner-up in 2021.
His teammate Primoz Roglic, a three-time Vuelta a Espana winner, had provided a support in the attacks before he cracked on the last hill.
Another Jumbo-Visma man Wout van Aert began the demolition job by setting a swift early pace alongside Alpecin-Fenix’s Mathieu van der Poel, who was forced to abandon the race. 
“My team were amazing, above all Primoz, he gave everything, what a generous, amazing guy,” Vingegaard said. 
“I can’t get over it,” he added.
The 2018 champion Geraint Thomas and his teammate Adam Yates also overtook Pogacar in the finale.
The Welshman is fourth in the overall standings just four seconds off the Slovenian while Quintana is fifth.
Vingegaard began a series of lacerating attacks on Pogacar on the penultimate mountain Col du Galibier.
But it was not until the final ascent that he suddenly lost ground.
To witness this epic stage there were camper vans galore, flaming barbecues and countless amateur cyclists who had taken on the legendary ascent in the morning.
Often running alongside the riders fans who had been gathering here for days gave the action-packed stage the audience it deserved.
While the Alps and the valleys below provided a stunning panorama for a magnificent stage.
Thursday’s stage on France’s July 14 national holiday may provide a similar shake up and is billed as the Tour’s toughest ending on the Alpe d’Huez climb, known for partying fans and champion performances.

1,Pakistan to go ahead with Test series despite emergency in Sri Lanka,PCB spokesperson says team set to fly to Galle on Thursday.,"KARACHI: Pakistan will go ahead with the two-Test series in Sri Lanka despite a state of emergency having been declared in the island country.
Already in Sri Lanka, Pakistan wrapped up a three-day tour match in Colombo against the Sri Lanka Cricket XI in the backdrop of massive protests in the country due to the escalating economic crisis.
“The series will go ahead as planned,” a PCB spokesperson told Dawn on Wednesday, with the first Test set to be played in Galle from Saturday.
“The team is set to fly to Galle on Thursday and is very happy with the arrangements made by Sri Lanka Cricket.
“We are in touch with SLC and with the Pakistan High Commission in Sri Lanka regarding the situation.”
Last week, Sri Lanka concluded an all-format series against Australia, featuring Twenty20 Internationals, One-day Internationals and Tests.
Following Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fleeing the country amid protests, the island nation declared a state of emergency on Wednesday. Rajapaksa left the country on a military aircraft with his wife and two bodyguards and landed in the Maldives.
Making things complicated, thousands of people stormed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe’s palace as well on Wednesday. It has forced the country’s military to step in and urge people to refrain from doing so. With curfews in entire Colombo, Sri Lanka is in a state of turmoil and despair.
Sri Lanka’s national television network, Rupavahini, briefly suspended broadcast after protesters entered the TV station. The telecast resumed later.
Reports on Wednesday suggested that the Asian Cricket Council has also put Bangladesh on standby as hosts for the Asia Cup, which Sri Lanka was due to hold next month.
SLC chief executive Ashley de Silva said on Wednesday that not being able to host the Asia Cup would result in a loss of US$5-6 Million in revenue.
“Big revenues get generated by hosting teams like India and Pakistan,” de Silva was quoted as saying by the InsideSport website. “That’s why we are still trying to persuade the countries to play in Sri Lanka. For us revenues are critical. At this stage even for our country any incoming dollar is critical. We are all geared up to host the Asia Cup and we all are in a positive mood.”

4,Olympic champion Jacobs to run at world championships,ROME: Italy’s shock Olympic 100 metre champion Marcell Jacobs will bid to add the world crown to his medals ...,"ROME: Italy’s shock Olympic 100 metre champion Marcell Jacobs will bid to add the world crown to his medals cabinet despite an injury-affected campaign, the Italian Athletics Federation (FIDAL) said on Wednesday.
The 27-year-old will be on the start line for the 100m heats which get underway on Friday, the first day of the world championships in Eugene, Oregon.
Jacobs kicked off the season with world 60m indoor gold in Belgrade, but a thigh injury in mid-May has disrupted his outdoor campaign withdrawing at short notice from several meets.
“The double Olympic champion (he also won 4x100 metres relay gold in Tokyo) will take part in the 100m heats scheduled for Friday,” said the federation in a statement.
“The decision was taken after a discussion between the athlete, his coach Paolo Camossi and the technical directors of the Italian team after reassuring news coming out of his training camp at Beaverton, near Portland.” Camossi told Wednesday’s edition of newspaper Corriere della Sera, the injury cloud had been well and truly lifted.
“The physical problem has been resolved, he does not feel any pain at all,” said Camossi.
Jacobs, who has also been affected by intestinal problems this season which forced him to withdraw from the Nairobi meet at the beginning of May, has run just two 100m this term.
He timed 9.99 seconds, aided by a favourable wind, on May 18 and then on June 25 won the Italian title in a time of 10.12sec, far from the European record of 9.80sec he set when winning the Olympic title in Tokyo last year.

5,"Zaheer Abbas shows improvement, remains in hospital",The 74-year-old batter was hospitalised due to deteriorating health in London last month.,"LAHORE: The health of Pakistan batting great Zaheer Abbas is improving but remains in a hospital in London, his wife said on Wednesday.
“Zaheer’s condition by the grace of Allah is improving but he is still in the hospital,” Zaheer’s wife told Dawn from London.
To a question, Zaheer’s wife said the Pakistan Cricket Board was in contact with her, adding PCB chairman Ramiz Raja had talked to her to inquire about Zaheer’s health.
Known as Asian Bradman for his superb batting display, 74-year-old Zaheer was hospitalised due to deteriorating health in London last month.
The 78-Test veteran, who suffered from Covid-19 in 2021, again faced the same situation while travelling from Dubai to London in mid-June. After reaching London, he was taken to hospital in a critical condition and remained in the ICU for several days.
The Sialkot-born Zaheer, who played for Pakistan from 1969 to 1985 and acted as president of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2015-16, suffered from back pain when he was in Karachi before leaving on June 1 for the UAE where he stayed for two weeks before leaving for London.

Omanyala set the African men’s 100 metres record after clocking a time of 9.77 seconds at the Kip Keino Classic meeting in Nairobi in September 2021.
The Kenyan sprinter has been included in the entry list for the 100m event at the World Championships, which begin in Eugene, Oregon on Friday.
“Ferdinand is still waiting for his visa or alternative clearance to depart from Nairobi,” a spokesperson for Omanyala told Reuters.
“It is frustrating but he remains hopeful to make the trip.”
The 26-year-old won the African 100m title last month and was the first Kenyan to qualify for the Olympic 100m semi-finals in Tokyo last year.

7,South Africa prioritise T20 competition ahead of World Cup qualification,SYDNEY: South Africa’s quest to achieve automatic qualification for the 2023 Cricket World Cup became more...,"SYDNEY: South Africa’s quest to achieve automatic qualification for the 2023 Cricket World Cup became more difficult on Wednesday when the country’s board agreed to forfeit a series against Australia.
Cricket South Africa (CSA) withdrew from a scheduled three-match World Cup Super League series in Australia in January in order to have their best players available for a domestic Twenty20 league.
The matches had been scheduled for Jan 12, 14 and 17 in Hobart, Sydney and Perth respectively.
South Africa are languishing in 11th place in the Super League, with the top eight qualifying automatically for the World Cup in India next year.
The loss of the 30 points available for the series means South Africa will almost certainly have to win their remaining series against India and England, plus two postponed matches against the Netherlands, to avoid playing in a qualifying tournament.
“As difficult as this decision has been for CSA, the long-term sustainability of our new T20 League is reliant on having all our domestic players available for this exciting new addition to the CSA calendar,” CSA chief executive Pholetsi Moseki said in a statement.
Cricket Australia announced earlier on Wednesday that it had been unable to accommodate South Africa’s request to change the dates of the series.
A backlog of postponed fixtures from the pandemic meant there was no window available to reschedule before the qualification cut-off in May.
IMMENSE DISAPPOINTMENT
Moseki said the matches had originally been scheduled for 2020 but had been postponed because of the pandemic.
“CSA is always keen on honouring its bilateral commitments,” said Moseki.
“CSA offered four options ... unfortunately, and to our disappointment, none of these were acceptable to Cricket Australia.
“CSA has agreed that the International Cricket Council award Australia the competition points.” 
Cricket Australia chief executive Nick Hockley said it was  “disappointing” and unfortunately, due to the congested international schedule including  the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, there are no alternative dates available, but the three-Test series against South Africa in December and January would go ahead as planned.
The loss of the series means three other Australia fixtures have had venue changes to provide an even spread of matches across the country for fans.
A men’s Twenty20 match against the West Indies on Oct 7 has moved from the Gold Coast to Brisbane and a Twenty20 international against England two days later has switched to Perth, from Brisbane.
A women’s T20 match against Pakistan on Jan 26 moves from Canberra to Hobart.

Williams, who struck seven fours off 39 balls, and Luke Jongwe (29 not out) were key figures as the home team posted 146-8 after being put in to bat by Jersey, a tiny island between England and France.
Jersey scored 123-5 in reply with Harrison Carlyon (45) and Benjamin Ward (35 not out) the chief contributors, leaving Zimbabwe winners by 23 runs.
“It is always nice to win when there is pressure around. It is an amazing thing for us to grow. Coach Dave Houghton brings a wealth of experience,” said Williams.
“We are working well as a unit. It is amazing to have that. It is always nice to contribute. It is also nice to contribute to winning ways.” Captain Craig Ervine said:  “You always want to start well and we definitely did that. Batting on a slightly tougher wicket, the guys knuckled down, especially Sean and Raz (Sikandar Raza).
“And then Luke Jongwe finished it off well to get us to 140 odd runs, which we believed was enough to defend.” Jersey skipper Charles Perchard said:  “I thought we showed great fight with the ball for 20 overs to restrict them to 146, which we backed ourselves to chase down.
“We fought exceptionally hard and the boys are pretty gutted now. The plan was to attack their spinners, but we did not quite manage that and Zimbabwe bowled and fielded well.” 
Seeking a first T20 World Cup appearance, the United States were far too strong for Singapore despite the Asian nation being ranked six places higher.
Put in to bat after losing the toss, the Americans scored 201-6 as Steven Taylor followed up a first round century against Jersey with a 58 that included two sixes and seven fours.
Jaskaran Malhotra also posted a 58, laced with four sixes, and captain Monank Patel hit 39 for a team bolstered by former South Africa fast bowler Rusty Theron.
Singapore flopped for the second successive day when batting, making only 69 with only Anantha Krishna (21 not out) showing resistance.
The US, who top Group A on net run rate, and Zimbabwe have four points each and they meet on Thursday in the final round of group matches to decide who finishes first.
Group B favourites the Netherlands are almost certain to make the semi-finals after a second win in as many days, this time by seven wickets against Hong Kong.
Hong Kong won the toss, batted and were all out for 116, thanks mainly to 60 runs from captain and opener Nizakat Khan.
The Dutch cruised to 117-3 with 40 balls to spare as Max O’Dowd (45) and Bas de Leede (36 not out) led the way for the four-time T20 World Cup qualifiers.
Papua New Guinea recovered from a heavy opening-day defeat by the Netherlands to get back into contention for a last-four place with an eight-wicket triumph over Uganda.
The runs of Simon Ssesazi (78) and Riazat Ali Shah (48) steered the Africans to 160-4, but an unbeaten 93 from captain Assad Vala lifted the Pacific islanders to 161-2 and victory with 20 balls remaining.
Leaders Netherlands have four points and if they beat second-placed Uganda on Thursday, Papua New Guinea will progress to the penultimate stage provided they overcome struggling Hong Kong.

9,St Andrews hosts 150th British Open with McIlroy chasing ‘Holy Grail’,ST ANDREWS: St Andrews hosts the 150th British Open from Thursday with Rory McIlroy starting as the favourite for ...,"ST ANDREWS: St Andrews hosts the 150th British Open from Thursday with Rory McIlroy starting as the favourite for the Claret Jug while a determined Tiger Woods hopes to make an impact at a venue where he has triumphed twice before. 
Record crowds for the week of 290,000 are expected on Scotland’s east coast for this landmark edition of the world’s oldest golf tournament, which comes to the Old Course for the 30th time. 
With fine weather expected to continue for much of the week, it is shaping up to be a fitting way to mark a historic British Open, even if the sport continues to be rocked by the fallout caused by the breakaway LIV Series. 
Players who left to join the Saudi-backed tour were allowed to take part by Open organisers, just as they were at last month’s US Open despite both the PGA Tour and DP World Tour moving to ban the rebels. 
That means four-time major winner Brooks Koepka, Sergio Garcia, Bryson DeChambeau, Dustin Johnson and former Open champion Phil Mickelson will all tee off on Thursday. 
McIlroy, though, is aiming to end an eight-year wait to add to his four major titles and the Northern Irishman is the favourite in the eyes of bookmakers. 
“I think it’s the Holy Grail of our sport. So not a lot of people are going to get that opportunity to achieve that, but that’s what winning an Open at St Andrews is,” McIlroy said on Tuesday. 
The world number two won the 2014 Open at Hoylake but missed the chance to defend his title in St Andrews a year later after injuring an ankle playing football. 
“I can’t go in here thinking that this might be my time. I just have to go out and play a really good tournament,” he added. 
McIlroy will tee off in Thursday’s first round alongside Collin Morikawa, winner of last year’s Open at Royal St George’s, and Xander Schauffele, who triumphed in last weekend’s Scottish Open. 
There is no shortage of contenders, not least among the large contingent of American stars including world number one Scottie Scheffler and 2017 Open winner Jordan Spieth. 
“If you’re not getting amped up to play in this Open, I’m not sure this is the right sport for you,” said Spieth on Tuesday, when stiff breezes blowing across the course served as a reminder of the challenges St Andrews can pose. 
There has been some talk of the Old Course becoming too easy, 149 years on from the first Open here, but it still captivates players. 
They will continue to be challenged in particular by the par-4 17th -- the Road Hole is one of the toughest in golf, where players must send their tee shots over the Old Course Hotel. 
Jack Nicklaus, twice an Open champion here and who was this week made an honorary citizen of the town, called St Andrews “a magical place”. 
Woods, now 46, won here in 2000 and 2005 and was determined to return despite suffering severe leg injuries in a car crash last year. 
“For the most part of my rehab I was just hoping that I could walk again,” admitted Woods, who skipped last month’s US Open to improve his chances of featuring this week. 
“I’m not going to play a full schedule ever again. My body just won’t allow me to do that. I don’t know how many Open Championships I have left here at St Andrews, but I wanted this one,” said Woods, who will play with US Open winner Matt Fitzpatrick in the first two rounds. 
Woods, meanwhile, was outspoken in his criticism of the LIV rebels, who could yet end up being barred from featuring in majors in the future. 
“I disagree with it. I think that what they have done is they have turned their back on what has allowed them to get to this position,” he said. 
While the Saudi-backed LIV Series offers record prize money of $25 million for each of its 54-hole events, British Open prize money totals $14 million. 
McIlroy just hopes the winner’s cheque does not end up in the hands of one of the rebels. 
“Selfishly, for me, yes, I think it would be better for the game,” he said. 
Woods, McIlroy and Paul Lawrie were announced as honorary members of St. Andrews by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club on Wednesday. 
“I warmly congratulate Tiger, Rory and Paul on becoming honorary members of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club,” St. Andrews captain Peter Foster said in a statement. “They have each made huge contributions to golf and played their part in inspiring millions to take up and follow the sport around the world. 
“They are not only great champions but fantastic ambassadors for golf and have brought so much joy to so many young fans in particular. This is entirely fitting recognition for three such distinguished sporting figures, and I have no doubt they will continue to give exemplary service to the sport through their new roles in the club.”

They will also have to wear face masks when not in their rooms or exercising at the July 28 - Aug 8 Games as part of team health protocols.
“Our primary focus is that we can get our athletes to the starting line and they are performance ready”, Thomas told News Corp media on Wednesday.
“We have to put these measures in place to minimise the transmission of Covid and other diseases as well.”  Covid continues to disrupt global sport, with a number of swimmers forced to pull out of the recent swimming world championships in Budapest after testing positive.
Around 5,000 athletes from 72 nations and territories are due to compete at Birmingham.
The Office for National Statistics estimated 3.95% of people in England, or one in 25, were Covid positive during the week ending June 29.
Athletes were subject to strict Covid protocols while in a  “closed loop” at the Beijing Winter Olympics and also at last year’s summer Olympics in Tokyo.
Unlike the Olympics, athletes will not have to leave Birmingham soon after their events finish.
Thomas said Australia’s athletes would be permitted to stay and support team-mates but not at their competition venues.
“There wont be an opportunity to go and watch other events because unfortunately those seats will be in public spectating areas, which presents a very high risk of Covid-19 transmission,” she added.

11,Chelsea complete Sterling signing from Manchester City,"LONDON: England forward Raheem Sterling has joined Chelsea on a five-year contract from Manchester City, the two...","LONDON: England forward Raheem Sterling has joined Chelsea on a five-year contract from Manchester City, the two Premier League clubs announced on Wednesday.
The deal is worth up to 50 million pounds ($59.60 million), according to British media reports.
“I’ve obviously achieved a lot in my career so far, but there is still so much more to achieve and I’m really looking forward to doing that in a Chelsea shirt,” Sterling told the club website.
“London is my home and where it all started for me, and it’s amazing I now have the opportunity to play in front of friends and family week in, week out at Stamford Bridge.”  Sterling becomes Chelsea’s first signing under the new ownership led by Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital, who officially took over from Russian Roman Abramovich at the end of May.
The 27-year-old played 47 games in all competitions for City last season, scoring 17 times and providing nine assists.
After starting his senior career with Liverpool, Sterling moved to City in July 2015 and established himself as a regular in the Manchester club’s frontline, netting 131 times in 339 games for Pep Guardiola’s side.
He went on to win both the league title and League Cup four times as well as one FA Cup.
However, he fell down the pecking order last season, playing only a limited role in City’s run to the league title and the Champions League semi-final, with Guardiola often preferring Phil Foden or Jack Grealish on the left side of attack.
Sterling said farewell to City in a social media post earlier on Wednesday.
“I arrived in Manchester a 20-year-old. Today, I leave as a man. Thank you for your endless support. It’s been an honour to wear the shirt of Manchester City,” he wrote.
Sterling, capped 77 times by England, will add much-needed firepower to Chelsea’s attack following their struggles in front of goal last season and the departure of Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan.

Financial details were not disclosed but Spanish media reported that Barcelona will pay 58 million euros ($58.33 million) in a fee that could go up to 68 million with the agreed add-ons.
“FC Barcelona and Leeds United Football Club have reached an agreement in principle for the transfer of Raphael Dias Belloli, Raphinha, pending the player passing his medical,” Barcelona said in a statement.
Chelsea and Arsenal both tried to make a late push in an effort to sign the player, but the Brazil international chose to join Barcelona, who finished second in La Liga last season.
Barcelona said they were buying:  “a winger who is excellent in one on  ones, taking on defenders being a key part of his game.” Raphinha spent  two seasons at Elland Road, scoring 17 goals and providing 12 assists  after they signed him from Ligue 1 outfit Rennes for 17 million - the  French side are due a cut of the transfer fee. The 25-year-old previously also played for Sporting CP.
Raphinha has taken the front seat to be Brazil’s right winger at this year’s World Cup in Qatar, starting seven of the last nine games of his national team and chipping in with three goals and two assists since being called for the first time by coach Tite in October 2021.
Raphinha becomes manager Xavi Hernandez’s third signing of the transfer window following the arrivals of Franck Kessie and Andreas Christensen on free transfers.
Forward Ousmane Dembele, whose Barcelona contract expired last month, joined the team on Tuesday and is expected to sign a new deal with the Catalan giants. Dembele’s potential contract extension would boost Barcelona’s attacking options as the team also look to sign Poland striker Robert Lewan­dowski from Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich.
Barcelona later announced that they have reached an agreement with Portuguese club Sporting CP for the loan of winger Francisco Trincao until June 2023.
The deal includes the option to purchase the player when the loan period expires.
Trincao joined Barcelona from SC Braga in 2020, featuring 42 times and scoring three goals in all competitions for the Catalan club in the 2020-21 campaign. He then spent the following season on loan at Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers.

13,French senate report criticises security flaws over CL fiasco,PARIS: An enquiry by the French Senate into crowd chaos at this year’s  Champions League final between Liverpool...,"PARIS: An enquiry by the French Senate into crowd chaos at this year’s  Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid in Paris concluded that organisers were to blame,  not supporters, undermining claims by the police and French Interior Minister  Gerald Darmanin, the report also sparked political tensions between Britain and France. 
The May 28 final at Paris’ Stade de France, which Liverpool lost 1-0 to Real Madrid, was delayed after police forcefully held back people trying to enter the ground.
Riot police sprayed tear gas on fans, including women, children  as well as disabled fans in wheelchairs. Liverpool fans, such as Liverpool Mayor Steve Rotheram, also said they were robbed by criminals from the local Paris Seine St Denis suburb.
The investigation concluded that the problems were caused by a  “string  of dysfunctions” including a lack of preparation by French authorities  and poorly executed security arrangements.
Darmanin has consistently said that one of the main problems was large numbers of Liverpool fans turning up without valid tickets, but the Senate report also highlighted other failings.
“Ticketing cannot be considered as the sole or main reason for the incidents,” said Senator and co-chair of the enquiry Laurent Lafon.
“There was a lack of organisation between the different parties concerned,” added Lafon, “The conclusions of the minister on the evening and the day after  were not the right ones,  It was a biased conclusion,  imprecise.” Many Liverpool supporters struggled to travel to the stadium  because of a transport strike, then found themselves in bottlenecks and  crushes at the stadium entry gates. 
Mnister Amelie Oudea-Castera have apologised to supporters caught up in the trouble, but have maintained that many Liverpool supporters arrived with fake tickets - something denied by Liverpool fans.
The spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had also said in May that Johnson was hugely disappointed by how Liverpool fans had been treated in Paris, while Darmanin had said Liverpool posed public order problems.
Liverpool football club is particularly sensitive to the scapegoating of  its fans after they were falsely blamed for the Hillsborough stadium  disaster in Sheffield in 1989. 
“The role of a commission like ours is not to call for the  resignation of someone in the government,” Francois-Noel Buffet, a fellow co-chair of the investigation said when asked why  the commission had not called for Darmanin to resign. 
France is to host the Rugby World Cup next year and the Olympics in 2024. 
Authorities have also been under pressure to explain why security  camera footage from the stadium was not saved, removing a potentially  vital source of information for investigators. 
“The images will always be missing. That’s our biggest regret,” Buffet said. 
Darmanin, a law and order hardliner, issued his first partial  apology at the end of June, telling RTL radio:  “Should things have been  managed better at the Stade de France (stadium)? The answer is yes. Am I  partly responsible? The answer is yes.” The head of the Paris police,  Didier Lallement, admitted during a Senate hearing on June 9 that  security operations had been a  “failure”. 
But he defended the use of teargas to move fans back from the  stadium, saying there was  “no other way.” The Senate report recommended  that the police draw up clearer guidelines for the use of teargas and  adopt other crowd-control methods such as greater use of mounted  officers and water cannons.
