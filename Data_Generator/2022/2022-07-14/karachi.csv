0,"Oil price hike fuels anger, bitterness in Karachi's public vehicles","Sindh govt has not issued notification to increase fares of buses and coaches, say passengers, term additional fares illegal.","KARACHI: Despite the launch of separate green and red bus services by the federal and the provincial governments in Karachi, the people are still compelled to travel in old, ramshackle and untidy buses and Qingqis amid a severe paucity of decent public transport and their miseries are compounded by rising fuel prices.  
The massive increase in diesel and petrol prices by Rs132.39 and Rs98.85 per litre to Rs276.54 and Rs248.74 per litre over the past one month has become the cause of bitter and angry arguments between daily commuters and conductors of public buses as the transport operators have started to charge almost double the fare.  
After public buses, Qingqi rickshaw (pronounced ‘chingchi’ locally) operators have also started demanding Rs10-20 extra from passengers.  
Situation for both passengers and conductors may become more intense as petrol and diesel rates are projected to go up to Rs300 per litre in order to meet one of the main conditions set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the country to secure a loan. 

• Sindh govt has not issued notification to increase fares of buses, coaches • People earning a good living suddenly feel miserable due to jacked up prices 

While already under stress over huge price hikes in food prices, utility charges and jump in almost Rs20 in transport fares, any further rise in the fare for people earning Rs15,000-30,000 per month will make their lives more miserable and challenging.  
After the fuel price hike, a large number of people who used to go to work by their own cars, have abandoned the thought of driving their vehicles and started using public transport to save fuel cost. 
“Stop the bus,” a conductor loudly asked the bus driver and insisted the passenger get off the bus who dared to refuse to pay additional Rs20 while going from Water Pump in Federal B Area to Jama Cloth Market on M.A. Jinnah Road. 
Many passengers fearing humiliation and disrespect at the hands of conductors simply pay the additional fares. 
However many others who initially argue politely over the enhanced fares, find themselves unable to respond to indecent behaviour of bus conductors and pay the extra fare silently. 
These types of ugly scenes between the conductors and passengers were hardly seen a month ago when transport fares were within the reach of a common man. 
Now the anxiety level of both passengers and vehicle operators has crossed the limit and the situation has become highly charged resulting in daily exchange of indecent words between the two sides in public transport buses. 
No official notification on new rates
Many passengers told Dawn that demanding additional fares was illegal in absence of any provincial government’s notification regarding the fare hike. 
In another bus, an old man gave Rs30 to the bus conductor to reach Boulton Market from Karimabad, but the conductor pressurised him to pay an extra Rs10. 
“I have given my fare which is enough and cannot pay more as I need to manage other expenses,” the old man replied, but the conductor, while insulting him, told him that “you have the money in your pocket but you are not deliberately paying it”. 
On the other hand, some passengers also try to avoid paying bus fares after getting onto a bus. They start staring into their mobile phones, become engaged in calls or watch outside from the window giving the impression as they have already paid the fare especially when the conductor arrives to ask for the money. 
Some passengers make grim faces and flatly refuse to pay any extra amount saying “they do not have any money in their pockets”. In such a situation, either a humble or slightly well-off passenger is seen paying the fare to avert any ensuing clash. 
Transporters point of view
President of the Karachi Transport Itehad (KTI), Irshad Hussain Bukhari said: “We have passed on the impact of high diesel cost by raising fare at Rs10-20 in buses, mini buses and coaches in the last over one month.” 
After a new price hike in diesel rates by Rs13.23 per litre, he said “we may not raise the fare and will try to sustain the pressure of high transportation charges as we cannot snatch the fare from the consumers who are already hard pressed.” 
He agreed that the fares had been raised without any green signal or notification from the Sindh government.  
Mr Bukhari said that the provincial government had not increased the fares since 2016 and the transport owners had no option but to take out the impact of rising diesel costs from the pockets of passengers.  
He claimed that not only in Karachi, the transport charges had been increased all over the country.  
Responding to a question about conductors’ misbehaviour with passengers for the last one month, he said “the cost of living has not only soared for the passengers, but bus owners and conductors also do have families and they are also paying high prices of food items and utility bills”. 
Qingqi rickshaws story
Slightly better off passengers usually use these vehicles to travel on seats as compared to jam-packed buses and coaches. 
However, the Qingqi drivers have also adopted a sort of rude attitude after the massive hike in petrol prices. 
“I will take an extra Rs10-20 depending on your destination,” many Qingqi operators warn the passengers before allowing them into their vehicles so that the situation remains calm during the journey. 
Many men and women take the seat without seeking fare details, but later on start arguing with the drivers when they demand additional fare. 
It is also seen that when some passengers argue with the drivers at the time of paying fare, some passengers sitting inside a Qingqi request the passenger to kindly pay the extra fare as they are getting late. 
A rickshaw driver told Dawn that since the fares had been increased, several impatient and angry passengers had grabbed the neck of drivers, used abusive language and paid only the old fares, which was unjust. 
However, a large number of people simply paid the enhanced fare without creating any scene, he admitted. 
He said rickshaw drivers pay Rs1,000 rent to the owners of the vehicles and extra Rs100-200 at Adda (station), a sort of fee collected by a person at different places. Without paying this fee, one cannot run the Qingqi, he added. 
Giving an example, he said he spent Rs1,200-1,300 to fill the petrol tank for two rounds (from Allahwali New Karachi to Teen Hatti) which was earlier Rs600-700 when petrol price was Rs150 per litre. 
“Our business is going normal despite Rs84 per litre hike in petrol as low income groups mostly rely on Qingqi in view of very high rates of ride-hailing services like Careem, Uber and In Driver and bike services of these companies,” a rickshaw owner said. 
A customer said ride hailing services had also raised the fares after petrol price hike.

3,Rain-hit Gujjar Nullah residents get no govt help in Karachi,"A drowned in nullah, a woman died after roof of her house along the nullah caved him over past two days.","KARACHI: As the city braces for another strong monsoon spell, the situation along the Gujjar nullah grows serious where in over the past two days a man drowned and an old woman died when part of her house’s roof caved.
Representatives of the affected communities said the 27-km-long channel dug up on both sides of the Gujjar nullah from Khamiso Goth in New Karachi up to Haji Mureed Goth in Liaquatabad had become a death trap as the water accumulated in this ditch was causing water to overflow into their houses, leading to landslides and had weakened the foundation of nearby houses. 
“Today, a man in his 50s slipped and drowned into the nullah while he was draining out rainwater from his house lane. The residents had to act on a self-help basis as there was no response from the rescue service,” Sunila Anwar, a resident of Kausar Niazi Colony, located in the North Nazimabad area, told Dawn.
The residents were able to recover the man unconscious after more than an hour of search, and took him to nearby Ziauddin Hospital where he was declared dead.
He was identified as Boota Masih, a resident of Kausar Niazi Colony. 
In another incident, a woman in her 60s died when part of her house roof fell. She resided in a settlement along the nullah passing through the F.B Area. 
“We have been living here for decades, but the situation has never been so dangerous. The residents, most of whom the poorest of the poor, have no option, but to pray for their families’ safety,” said Dr Pervaiz Yaqub, a resident of Hasan Colony in Liaquatabad.
Rozina, a resident of the F.B. Area settlement recalled another incident from a few days back where a man suffered injuries when he slipped and hit an iron bar erected in the ditch.
The government had initiated an anti-encroachment operation along Gujjar nullah in 2020 and ever since the communities residing there have been raising serious concerns over the drive, including lack of documentation on the extent of possible damage to houses and long delay in the completion of construction work to build an embankment on both sides of the nullah.
They also complained that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, as well as the chief minister, haven’t fulfilled their promises and provided homes to the people being affected by the operation. Besides, few families have received the monetary support the government had announced.
“Right now, we demand that the government pay Rs1 million to each family in compensation for a case of drowning, electrocution, house flooding or other damage caused by government failure to protect people for the devastating rain,” said Zahid Farooq of Urban Resource Centre.
About the illegal settlements along the Gujjar nullah, he said, no government had ever built a wall or notified “nullah’s jurisdiction”. 
“No encroachment can take place without the cooperation of a local politician, the police and the staff in the commissioner office. It’s unfortunate to blame the poor who have had genuine reasons not to shift to other place despite government’s anti-encroachments drives over the years.”
The residents, he explained, had built social and religious contacts in these neighbourhoods which were located close to their workplace and children’s educational institutions. 
“We are not saying that the government allows encroachments, but it should rather talk to the communities instead of forcing a so-called solution on them. It’s a humanitarian issue and requires humane approach.” 
The government, resident demanded, should collect data on families through a field survey instead of drone survey that only helped collect information about physical infrastructure and not number of families living in one house. 
Affected residents also stated that the government hadn’t spent the Rs2 billion allocated for their rehabilitation.

4,CM Murad eyes victory in Sindh LG polls with ‘best performance’ against rain disaster,"Lambasts opposition for ""undue criticism"" over rain adversities .","KARACHI: Under serious criticism of the opposition parties and civil society, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Wednesday defended the performance of the city administration led by his adviser and spokesman for the provincial government showing full confidence that his Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), “which’s serving Karachiites with heart and soul”, would win the upcoming local bodies’ elections to bring its Karachi mayor. 
Sounded well-prepared and unhappy with the criticism his government was facing after the ‘disaster’ during the rains, he came up with a comparative data in an attempt to prove the better performance of the Karachi administration despite much heavier rainfall this year. 
Describing his government’s critics as “the so-called champions of the city”, the chief minister said that the rainwater was wiped out from the city in the shortest possible time except from the low-lying areas in the metropolis. 
“But some so-called champions of the city are accusing the provincial government of its failure to drain out the accumulated rainwater but the fact is that the city has been cleared, except the low lying areas by the evening of July 11,” he claimed. 

Lambasts opposition for ‘undue criticism’ over rain adversities 

“Our government has served the people of Karachi with heart and soul. And I am sure the PPP will clinch the slot of [Karachi] mayor during the upcoming local bodies’ election.”
Taking questions from journalists, he admitted the presence of some serious flaws in the Karachi’s infrastructural system that had badly damaged the city’s drainage system, but referred to the past “illegal activities” that allowed construction over nullahs even by the government institutions. 
“Various areas such as Saadi Town and areas of cantonments have been constructed on natural waterways which have blocked the natural flow of rainwater,” he said. 
The local government office at Tughlaq House was built on the storm-water drain, he said and referred to some other constructions built on nullahs. 
“I have not built or allowed these encroachments on nullahs. But yes, now I’ll take it up at the cabinet meeting and if it allows, I would bulldoze the local government department office on the nullah first and then request the others to follow the course.” 
He said the city recorded 342.2 millimetres of rains in less than 18 hours of span between July 10 and 11, which brought about major challenges for the city administration, but despite all odds it managed to perform with all available resources. 
He shared a plan of capacity building of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) and also about the launch of some new rainwater disposal projects. 
“By 2010, the KWSB had one fleet of 36 suction and jetting machines,” said Mr Shah. “Frequent sewage overflows are encountered across Karachi due to overloading of the sewerage system. The addition of 20 new suction & jetting machines has improved KWSB’s capacity to clean and de-silt the affected sewerage system of Karachi. Another 56 suction & jetting machines are being added to existing fleet under a World Bank funded project and in this way the total number of machines will be increased to 112 within next six months.” 
Responding to a question, he said that the DHA had a problem in disposal of rainwater. 
Last year, he added, the DHA had constructed a drainage system, but it failed to cater to the requirement of such a heavy rainfall. The Sindh government was in touch with the DHA and Cantonment authorities to help them in this regard, he said. 
Criticises opposition parties
The Sindh CM also criticised the opposition parties — the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) — and accused them of contributing to weakening the city’s infrastructure while they had been enjoying local government in the city mainly under a dictator rules. 
He also questioned the performance of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) which despite winning mandate from Karachi and enjoying government in the Centre “did not give anything to this city”.

5,"Parties question performance of PPP during rains, demand empowered LG system","KARACHI: Sticking to their stand against the “incompetence” of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), political parties ...","KARACHI: Sticking to their stand against the “incompetence” of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), political parties on Wednesday continued to criticise the Sindh government for the recent devastation in Karachi and other parts of the province after rains, and warned that the crisis would not be over as another spell of monsoon rains was fast approaching.
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P), Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), which are poised to contest the local government elections in Karachi and Hyderabad on July 24, in their fresh reaction not only questioned the performance of the PPP government, but also called for immediate measures to empower the upcoming municipal administration in the country’s business capital.
MQM-P leader Khawaja Izharur Hassan, criticising Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah for the “fresh failure” of the Karachi administration, held him responsible for all the rain-related incidents.
“There’s a huge difference between the demand of the MQM-P and the rest of the political parties in Karachi,” he told a press conference at the party’s temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad.
“The others are more interested and making claims to win the elections to bring their mayor in the office. The MQM-P is demanding an empowered system. This local government system is nothing, but eyewash. It’s so unfortunate that the PPP government is not willing to fix this flawed system,” he said.
Haleem shows video of TMOs partying
Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Shiekh came up with a “documented and video proof” of the Sindh municipal officers who, he said, were “enjoying a music party” when the monsoon season was approaching, and the Met office was issuing warning of urban flooding in most parts of the province.
Addressing a press conference, he said that the ruling party was least concerned about the plight of flooded Sindh. He also shared videos clips and “documentary evidence” showing municipal officers attending a party in Nawabshah.
“On one hand, Sindh is drowned into rain and sewage and on the other, local government officers are enjoying pool musical party using their influence, government funds and connections,” he said. “There were 30 officers who were attending pool side musical party instead of planning for predicted monsoon rains.”
JI demands Wahab’s resignation
JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman insisted that the Sindh government had badly failed in keeping its words about resolving the rain-related problems. 
After the passage of two days, he said, the rainwater was drained out from major roads in the city, but no efforts were made to clear internal roads and streets in a large number of neighbourhoods.
Speaking at a press conference at Idara Noor-i-Haq, he said that the Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab and Labour Minister Saeed Ghani had quarantined themselves, but 30 million Karachiites didn’t have the option to do so.
“Karachiites need a solution to the problem they are facing. The attitude shown by the provincial government depicted the level of seriousness among those at the helm of affairs towards Karachi and Karachiites,” he said.
He reiterated his demand to remove the political administrator in Karachi and raised question about the Rs660 million allocated for cleanliness of storm water drains. 
MWM blames ‘incompetent rulers’ 
The Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen said that unwise measures of “incompetent” rulers had ruined the city.
MWM leader Ali Hussain Naqvi said in a statement that provincial budget of year 2021-22 showed revenue of Rs1,400 billion. He said Rs300bn would be allocated for the development of Karachi, but unfortunately this city could receive only Rs38bn and nobody knew where the said amount was used.
He suggested the Sindh government that rainwater should be preserved by constructing water reservoirs on an emergency basis. 
He further said that if the government was sincere with the public, it should pay immediate attention towards the infrastructure of all the districts of the province.

6,Eid films do good business despite heavy rains in city,KARACHI: Three Pakistani films were released on Eidul Azha. They are: Quaid-e-Azam Zindabad directed by Nabeel...,"KARACHI: Three Pakistani films were released on Eidul Azha. They are: Quaid-e-Azam Zindabad directed by Nabeel Qureshi, London Nahi Jaunga helmed by Nadeem Baig and Abdul Khaaliq Khan’s Lafangey. Two days prior to Eid holidays, July 8, the big Hollywood Marvel offering Thor: Love and Thunder was also screened. 
Since it was expected that the movies would fare well at the box office during the holiday season, especially in Karachi, the demographically largest city of the country, it’s suspected that the torrential rains on the second day of Eid may have affected their earnings overall. 
If word of mouth is anything to go by, Quaid-e-Azam Zindabad and London Nahin Jaunga saw footfalls that would not have disappointed their makers. They seem to be doing well. 
It is difficult to ascertain which one had more public acceptance in terms of storyline but it seems that both QZ and LNJ with A-list Pakistani actors — Mahira Khan and Fahad Mustafa as the lead romantic pair in the former and Humayun Saeed and Mehwish Hayat in the latter — heavily rely on light-hearted humour — a trend of sorts for Eid. 
Talking to Dawn about whether the heavy downpour on July 11 caused a considerable damage to the business of the holiday releases or to Thor, producer and film exhibitor Nadeem Mandviwalla said although Atrium cinemas were closed that day, the rains did not make a huge dent in the box office performance of the movies. 
He believed they’re doing fine commercially. 
Quoting an independent source, he added on day two of Eid alone (not combined), London Nahin Jaunga had collected Rs25.5 million and Quaid-e-Azam Zindabad, Rs17m. 
Compared to the Pakistani movies, Thor: Love and Thunder, with Taika Waititi in the director’s chair, up until July 11, had earned Rs49m. 
The cast of the film includes Chris Hemsworth, Christian Bale, Tessa Thompson, Natalie Portman and Russell Crowe. The film has not yet been screened in Islamabad as it not certified by the Central Board of Film Censors (CBFC).

After getting released from police custody, Mr Ghauri left Karachi for the United Arab Emirates. on Wednesday night.
Mr Ghauri was arrested at Karachi airport on June 5 after he returned to the country ending his seven-year self-imposed exile. The next day, police shown him arrested in the 2015 hate speech case and obtained his physical remand from the administrative judge of the antiterrorism courts to interrogate him and complete the investigation into the seven-year-old case.
On Wednesday, the investigating officer produced the MQM leader before the administrative judge upon expiry of his physical remand.
The IO verbally informed the judge that the MQM leader was interrogated in custody and no evidence was found to show his involvement in the alleged offence.
He stated that the record showed that he was out of country when the case was registered against him and other party leaders.
The IO further said that the custody of Ghauri was no more required and recommended to set him free due to lack of evidence.
On the other hand, defence counsel Shabbir Shah also argued that his client was in the United States at the time when he along with around 30 other MQM leaders including Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and Wasim Akhtar were booked in the present FIR.
He also produced travel documents in court and pointed out that majority of the nominated MQM leaders had already been acquitted in the present case.
He asked the court to discharge his client from the case since there was no evidence to prove his presence in the country at the time of occurrence of the alleged incident.
After hearing arguments from both sides, the judge ordered release of the MQM leader.
Later, Advocate Shah confirmed to Dawn that the police had set free Ghauri due to lack of evidence in the case.
However, he is also facing two other cases. Before his return to the country, he had obtained pre-arrest bail from the Sindh High Court in a corruption reference and a money laundering and terror financing case.
The former ports and shipping minister, along with MQM founder and other party leaders, had been booked by the Federal Investigation Agency in 2017 in a money laundering and terror financing case.

10,Wasa ill-prepared for urban flooding as Hyderabad braces for more rain,HYDERABAD: The cash-strapped and resource-constrained Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) is ill-prepared for coping...,"HYDERABAD: The cash-strapped and resource-constrained Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) is ill-prepared for coping with urban flooding as the city braces for the second spell of monsoon rainfall forecast to begin from July 14 according to as per meteorological department. 
Fortunately, the first spell of rain has passed without causing any major damage and putting to test the fragile infrastructure of Wasa, which wholly relies on funds received from Sindh government to carry out its rain emergency operations. 
But this monsoon season, the Sindh government has not so far issued any funds to Wasa to de-silt storm water drains and Nullahs to help drain out rainwater in the event of heavy rain.
The Met department predicts the second spell may continue till July 18. Hyderabad has so far received 135mm rainfall between July 5 and 10 at airport’s observatory and 113mm of rainfall at the city’s observatory. 
The resource-constrained agency always looked towards Sindh government and district administration for meeting its financial needs, especially during rain emergency. 
The agency used to receive subsidy from the federal government but it was discontinued two decades back in the first tenure of PML-N government and has not been restored since though Wasas in other major cities like Lahore and Faisalabad are still getting the subsidy. 
It has hence always looked towards Sindh government for grant-in-aid and has not been able to improve its own recoveries for one or the other reason while Sindh Local Government department that administers Wasa has not come up with any roadmap to improve its performance.  
Sindh secretary of finance Sajid Jamal Abro told Dawn that first and second quarter funds for unforeseen expenditures had already been released to districts. He was perhaps referring to a marginal allocation of unforeseen expenses amounting to Rs500,000 to Rs1m for any district.
The present Wasa management is carrying out de-silting work through contractors and getting pumps and machines on rent. “This is all being done on credit. Once the funds are released the liabilities will be cleared, otherwise they will keep accumulating,” said a Wasa official. 
He said that around Rs30m had been spent on oil and petrol so far. “The amount has increased on account of rise in petroleum prices,” said the official.  
The city’s large part is managed through open drains, which usually get heavily silted and require de-silting for one or the other reason. The cleaning work involves a great deal of efforts by Wasa officials and contractual labourers.
“While Karachi had to bear with a heavy spell of rainfall in just one day, we are spared by nature as we have received 100mm rainfall in four days which remains a blessing,” said a city resident.   
Prolonged electricity breakdown by Hyderabad Electric Company always multiplies problems for Wasa, adding to its expenditures in terms of fuel expenses for standby generators. Since the oil prices keep skyrocketing, the fuel bill increases substantially.
According to another Wasa official, the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board was also assisting Wasa in ongoing rain emergency operations and helping it remove sludge from drains. “The board is providing vehicles for shifting the sludge from the storm water drains,” said an official.

15,‘Peons linked to PPP made presiding officers in Dadu’,DADU: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Sindh leader Liaquat Ali Jatoi has said that officials openly associated with ...,"DADU: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Sindh leader Liaquat Ali Jatoi has said that officials openly associated with Pakistan Peoples Party and several low-ranked government staffers including peons have been made presiding officers and appealed to Chief Election Commissioner to remove them.
Jatoi, who is also a former chief minister of Sindh, said at a press conference at his native village, Beto Jatoi, in Mehar taluka on Wednesday that PPP’s elected representatives had turned Dadu into a den of crimes.
But now, he said, they would not allow them to continue with their crimes. If local PPP leaders left the party they could not win any seat in their constituencies, he said.
He said the corrupt leaders had fattened their bellies after swallowing up ill-gotten public money. 
He alleged that Dadu SSP was unashamedly working for the ruling party as he kept sitting in the party’s camp office and plotting to kidnap opposition candidates. 
He said that the Corporate Social Responsibility funds the oil and gas companies released to Dadu district, and the share in royalty, over the last 15 years came to Rs15 billion but nobody knew where the huge amount had been spent.
Jatoi appealed to chief of army staff to protect people of Pakistan and save their lives by holding free and fair elections. Price of fertiliser, including DAP per bag, had risen to Rs12,000 and urea to Rs4,000 while fuel had already gone out of people’s reach, he said, adding the rise in diesel price had destroyed agriculture sector.
