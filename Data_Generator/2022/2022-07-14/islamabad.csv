Deputy Commissioner Tahir Farooq said most areas that were affected by the rain had blocked drainage points due to encroachments.
“The city areas were cleared in the afternoon and rainwater was drained out. Officials of civic bodies remained on their toes,” he said, adding that the chief minister had issued directions to authorities concerned to assist the cantonment administration in draining out water.
“We are ready to deal with any situation in the next two to three days,” he added.

1,"30-year average rainfall record broken in Sindh, Balochistan: Sherry",Says Sindh received 625pc more rainfall than the 30-year average while Balochistan received 501pc more rainfall.,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman on Wednesday said Sindh and Balochistan had been experiencing severe monsoon pressure for the last 13 days, with both provinces receiving rainfall more than the 30-year average.
In her twitter message on the ongoing monsoon rains, Ms Rehman said: “Sindh has received 625pc more rainfall than the 30-year average and Balochistan received 501pc more rainfall.”

 





 
The percentage was much higher than last week, when she warned at a press conference that Sindh had received 261pc more rainfall than the average while the percentage in Balochistan was 274pc, which was the highest until July 6.
The minister also warned that the Meteorological Department had predicted more torrential rains from Thursday.
“Once again there will be more rains in Sindh and Balochistan,” Ms Rehman tweeted, adding that relevant authorities had been directed to remain alert and take precautionary measures.
She said the above normal monsoon season was triggered by global warming, expressing concern over the incidents of flash floods and glacial lake outburst floods.
She urged people to heed to the weather advisories to minimise loss of lives and damage to properties.
The minister drew attention to the economic losses suffered by Pakistan due global warming, which stood at 9.2pc of the gross domestic product (GDP). 
This was highest in the region, even more than India and Nepal, in terms of percentage of the GDP, she added.

Meanwhile, residents of Tench Bhatta staged a protest against the authorities concerned over their dissatisfaction with them. They were of the view that loss of life and property could have been avoided if Leh Nullah was not blocked with trash as this is the reason that low-lying areas in the city are inundated.
Later, after negotiations with local police, protesters dispersed peacefully hoping that the nullah would be cleaned before more damage is caused.

4,"Buildings, food outlets on Margalla Hills against law: IHC","Holds CDA, other state institutions responsible for encroachments","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday held that the Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) decision allowing construction of buildings and food outlets at the Margalla Hills in violation of the Margalla Hills National Park Management Plan as well as Wild Life Ordinance 1979.
“Regrettably, most illegal encroachments on the Margalla Hills have been made by the state institutions/entities like the Pakistan Navy, Pakistan Air Force, etc., and the CDA was either complacent or seemed to be helpless,” observed Chief Justice IHC Athar Minallah in a detailed judgment he wrote on a petition moved by Prof Zahid Baig Mirza – an expert in the field of biodiversity, habitats and ecosystem. 
The petitioner had invited the attention of the court towards lack of will to protect the natural assets that belonged to the people of the country.
Earlier in Jan 11, 2022, IHC in a short order had ordered CDA to seal off the Monal Restaurant, situated at the picturesque Margalla Hills, and ordered taking control of the Margalla Greens Golf Club built on encroached land also declaring illegal the military’s claim to 8,602 acres of Margalla Hills National Park.

Holds CDA, other state institutions responsible for encroachments

However on March 8, the Supreme Court suspended the Jan 11high court judgment of sealing and taking over possession of the Monal Restaurant.
In its judgement, IHC chief justice also mentioned the Stockholm Declaration on the Human Environment, adopted by the United Nations Conference in 1972, the World Charter for Nature 1982, Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 1992, IUCN Draft Covenant 1995, Global Pact for Environment 2017 and declared that it was the duty of the state and its public functionaries to protect the Margalla Hills, its flora and fauna and to restore the damage caused by removing the illegal encroachments.
It is also the duty of the state to proceed against all those who were responsible for violating the rights of the people, the judgment said, but regretted that the State and its public functionaries had failed in protecting, preserving and managing the notified area of the Margalla Hills for the benefit of the present and future generations.
It was a classic case of undermining the rule of law. 
He added that the enforced laws had not been violated by private citizens, rather, by the institutions and by doing so they have exposed themselves to the consequences.
The CJ, in his judgment, regretted that the proceedings before the court were indeed disturbing because they have established a lack of political will to protect the rights of the citizens by allowing the destruction of Margalla Hills and thus irretrievably harming the native flora and fauna. 
The neglect or wilful disregard of institutions and public functionaries to perform their fundamental duty to implement the enforced laws and prevent their violation and abuse has already caused irretrievable damage to the natural habitats, ecosystem services and the biodiversity and thus has grave consequences in the context of environmental degradation and the challenges faced by humanity on account of the threatening consequences of climate change, the judgment said.
The Wildlife Ordinance 1979 was brazenly violated and disregarded by public functionaries who were under oath to uphold the law and protect the rights of the citizens.
Referring to the Naval Golf Course, which the judgment said was established on lands that falls outside the area allotted for its use and thus willingly undermined the sanctity of the Margalla Hills and violated the enforced laws. 
The court ordered CDA and the Wildlife Board established under the wildlife ordinance 1979 to take over the possession.
About the Monal Restaurant and other food outlets, the high court ordered that the property will be taken over by the wildlife board besides its fate and future use will be subject to exercising the duty of due diligence by the federal government, the wildlife board and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 1979.
Assisted by CDA, the wildlife board will also examine the legal status of other food outlets and take action and proceed in accordance with the law and it will be ensured that all were treated equally.
The judgment held that the Monal restaurant was the first concrete building constructed by the CDA in the protected and preserved notified area of the Margalla Hills followed by other constructions.

He assured the delegation that the issue would be resolved in consultation with the stakeholders to address their concerns over deemed rental income. 
Regular contacts and consultations with the business community will be intensified to get their feedback, an agreement with the IMF will be reached soon, he added.
RCCI President Nadeem Rauf told the minister that the construction sector has been affected by the imposition of tax on deemed rental income in the budget. 
He said industrial zones should be set up in Rawalpindi; special economic zones should be set up in Rawalpindi under CPEC.

10,Army’s engineering branch asked to conduct hydrological survey in Islamabad,CDA told not to issue NOCs to housing societies until its completion.,"ISLAMABAD: While a number of areas of the capital have been hit by floods during monsoon rain, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Wednesday requested the Engineer-in-Chief (E-in-C) branch of the Pakistan Army to conduct a hydrological survey of zones II, III, IV and V to avoid flooding in the future.
Moreover, the civic agency has decided to halt issuance of no-objection certificates (NOCs) to housing societies in zones II, III and V till completion of the survey.
According to a document, available with Dawn, after the loss caused by the flooding of nullahs in E-11 during torrential rains in 2021, the government had directed the CDA to conduct survey of E-11.
“The job of the said study was entrusted to Directorate of Design Consultancy, Engineer-in­ Chief Branch, GHQ and a report has recently been submitted. The recommendations made in the report are required to be implemented by Planning Wing and Engineering Wing, CDA,” the document stated.

CDA told not to issue NOCs to housing societies until its completion

“During the recent heavy downpour, flood-like situations in different water courses/nullahs/streams have been observed in various areas of Islamabad which necessitated a comprehensive study/survey (hydrological) to cope with the situations coming out of flooding or cloudbursts in future. This study is also required since recent climate changes have caused changes and even behaviours of water courses. Based upon the proposed hydrological study, relevant authorities and agencies such as CDA, ICT, NDMA etc, will be able to make mitigation plans for Islamabad,” the document added.
It said the CDA chairman had directed to explore the option of extending the scope of services of E-in-C Branch to carry out a detailed hydrological study across Islamabad in zones II, III, IV and V.
“The report so prepared shall also include recommendations for taking appropriate measures where required. Meanwhile, approvals of LOPs (Layout Plans) and NOCs shall be processed subject to hydrological study,” it said.
According to a senior CDA officer, the survey in different zones of the capital will be conducted to identify flaws so work to fix them could be carried out.
He said instructions have been issued to the planning wing of CDA and registrar cooperatives (ICT) which state that no NOC should be issued to housing societies till completion of the survey in zones II, III and V. He said it may take up to six months to complete the study.
“This is much needed since no survey has ever been done in detail. With this survey, lives and property will be protected,” he said.
It is worth mentioning that the urban area of Islamabad (zone I), is directly under the CDA and is considered to be the most planned area and remains safe during rains.

11,"Pims mother, child hospital remains sealed",ISLAMABAD: The Mother and Child Hospital (MCH) of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) and its pharmacy has...,"ISLAMABAD: The Mother and Child Hospital (MCH) of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) and its pharmacy has been sealed since July 6 due to which over 70 deliveries were being affected on daily basis.
The hospital administration has dedicated two operation theatres (OTs) of the Children Hospital (Pims) for deliveries and around 50 per cent cases are being referred to Polyclinic.
As mother and child hospital of Polyclinic also remains occupied, hospital administration has also dedicated Medical Ward II for the patients who are being referred from Pims MCH.
On July 1, the condition of three pregnant women in the gynae ward of Pims became critical and they had to be shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 
One of the patients died while the other two recovered and were later discharged. On July 5, Federal Minister for National Health Services (NHS) Abdul Qadir Patel announced that he had taken notice of the alleged use of infected syringes and Anaesthesia at Pims, adding criminal proceedings would be initiated against the hospital management if the allegation was proved. 
On July 6, a drug control team visited the store of gynaecology ward in Pims and took six samples of medicines and surgical items for testing and sealed both MCH and store.
On the other hand the hospital management sent a report to the ministry claiming that the woman died due to brain haemorrhage. Moreover, after getting a negative report from its own lab, it sent samples to the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology (AFIC) for a second opinion regarding the quality of anaesthesia and injections. 
A three-member inquiry committee, headed by Associate Professor Dr Mumtaz Ahmed Khan, was constituted to probe the incident. Other members of the committee are Assistant Prof Dr Naseem Akhtar and Dr Zoofeshan Jabeen Fatima.
Director Pims Dr Khalid Masood, while talking to Dawn, said that the MCH and store could not be open unless the Ministry of NHS decided to de-seal them.
“We have dedicated two OTs of Children Hospital for the deliveries and rest of the cases are being referred to the Polyclinic,” he said.
While replying to a question, Dr Masood said that the report from AFIC was yet to be received.
A doctor of Polyclinic, requesting not to be quoted, said that the hospital had dedicated Medical Ward II for the patients referred from Pims as its MCH also remained full all the time.
Meanwhile on Wednesday rumours were triggered that cases, similar to Pims, were reported in three private hospitals of Karachi. 
It was also being claimed that there was only one company which provided anaesthesia across the globe and its some batches sent to Pakistan were infected.
An official of Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap), requesting anonymity, said that after hearing about the cases Drap contacted all three hospitals of Karachi but it incidents could not be confirmed.
“Fact is that there were reports of fits in some cases but as hospitals were aware of Pims incident so staff panicked,” he said.
Chief Executive Officer Drap Dr Asim Rauf told Dawn that samples, collected from Pims MCH, were sent to Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) Karachi and reports were awaited.
“Although we have directed Pims not to dispose of all six medicines, used at MCH, and directed the company to hold the stock of Anaesthesia but there can be many other reasons for the death of patient such as OT, operation tools, environment, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) system, etc. I will be able to comment about it after getting the report from CDL, Karachi,” he said.
