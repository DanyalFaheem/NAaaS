0,Suri’s unilateral ruling did not enjoy parliamentary immunity: SC,"Justice Bandial says text of cypher used by Suri to dismiss the motion not shown to court, contents only partially disclosed.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has issued a detailed judgement explaining the reasons behind its decision to set aside a controversial ruling by the National Assembly speaker on April 3 that dismissed the no-confidence motion against then prime minister Imran Khan.
In the verdict authored by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, the top judge stated that by dismissing the no-confidence motion against Imran Khan, Mr Suri prima facie breached his constitutional duty. Justice Bandial said the April 3 ruling failed to qualify for protection of the internal proceedings of parliament under Article 69(1) as it was “not the outcome of a vote in the national assembly instead, it was a unilateral decision”.
Justice Bandial observed that the controversial action by the deputy speaker triggered a chain of events, the most concerning aspect of which was that it allowed the then PM to claim the constitutionally repugnant outcome of avoiding the no-trust motion without a vote by the assembly.
The court’s foremost priority was the maintenance of constitutional order which could only be achieved if the assembly was restored, Justice Bandial added.

Justice Bandial says text of cypher not shown to court, contents were only ‘partially disclosed’

Cypher not shown to court
Justice Bandial, while referring to the cypher used by Mr Suri to dismiss the motion against Imran Khan, explained that the text of the cypher was not shown to the apex court, though its contents were partially disclosed in the detailed reasons issued in support of the deputy speaker’s ruling.
The detailed reasons in addition to cabinet decision of April 2 acknowledged the need for an inquiry to establish the alleged collusion between the opposition and a foreign state.
“Such an inquiry into facts can, in the first place, be carried out either by a commission constituted by the federal government under the 2017 Act or by a specialised commission constituted under an Act of parliament or an ordinance,” Justice Bandial observed.
The PTI’s plea that the apex court should take suo motu over the defence of national security and allegation of breach of sovereignty was without precedent, the ruling explained.
Moreover, the opposition members who filed the notice were granted leave to move the motion against the then PM on March 28, crystallised the constitutional right and obligation for there to be a vote under Article 95(2) on the motion.
This right/obligation cannot be defeated or curtailed except by a vote on the floor of the assembly, the ruling said, adding: “Since the deputy speaker’s ruling unilaterally refused the right of vote granted by the constitution, no immunity under Article 69(1) attaches to it and the same can be reviewed by the court.”
High treason
Meanwhile, Justice Mazahar Alam Khan Miankhel, who retired on July 13, in his additional note observed that the exercise of authority was a sacred trust which was violated by the president, then PM, the then speaker, the then deputy speaker and the then law minister.
“Whether these acts attract Article 6 of the Constitution (high treason) is also left open to be determined by the parliamentarians to ponder should they leave open the doors for such unconstitutional acts or take suitable measures to stop such like mess in future,” Justice Miankhel suggested.
The elected representatives of the people were prevented from voting on the resolution and for such blatant transgression of the Constitution there must be consequences and the law must take its course, Justice Miankhel added.
‘Doctrine of necessity’
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel, in his additional note, observed that the action of the deputy speaker was biased, on the basis whereof, if permitted to hold fresh elections, would amount to giving licence to an authority to misuse the extraordinary power of the doctrine of necessity.
This country has already experienced misuse of the doctrine of necessity by the hands of unconstitutional forces time and again, which were legitimised by the apex court, but it did not achieve the desired results, he added.
Rather, the democracy suffered a lot because of misuse of the doctrine of necessity, Justice Mandokhel observed. He added the courts must discourage every action, which was contrary to the constitution and democratic norms.

MALE: Escaping Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa faced protests in the Maldives on Wednesday with dozens of compatriots urging the government not to provide him safe haven.
Sri Lankan expatriates carrying flags and placards denounced Rajapaksa, who fled his country early on Wednesday after protesters overran his Colombo residence at the weekend over the worsening economic crisis in the South Asian nation.
“Dear Maldivian friends, please urge your government not to safeguard criminals,” said a black and white banner held by Sri Lankans working in the island’s tiny capital.
Local media carried unverified videos of residents shouting insults at Rajapaksa as he walked out of the Velana International airport following his arrival on a military aircraft. As Sri Lankans protested at an artificial beach area in Male on Wednesday, Special Operations police confiscated placards and dispersed the demonstrators, witnesses said.

Defying tear gas and state of emergency, protesters storm PM’s office in Colombo

Local reports suggested that Rajapaksa was staying at an exclusive resort and would leave for either the United Arab Emirates or Singapore. “He is going into exile in either of the two locations,” a Sri Lankan security source in Colombo said. “Ensuring security would be a challenge because there are Sri Lankan communities in both countries.”
The main opposition Progressive Party of Maldives opposed the granting of free passage to Rajapaksa, who faces several court cases, including allegations of war crimes.
Meanwhile, protesters in Sri Lanka defied tear gas, water cannon and a state of emergency to storm the prime minister’s office on Wednesday after the president fled overseas, with the crowd demanding both men step down in the face of an economic crisis.
In a televised statement, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he had instructed the military and police to do “what is necessary to restore order”. But footage showed armed security personnel standing by in the grounds of his office as protesters, some holding national flags, milled around and took pictures.
Other demonstrators at one point broke into state television studios, as the country’s months-long political and economic crisis appeared to be moving towards a climax.
Tear gas and water cannons fired by police and the declaration of a nationwide state of emergency and a curfew failed to disperse them and the crowd poured into the building.
Wickremesinghe, 73, would automatically become acting president if Rajapaksa steps down, but has himself announced his willingness to resign if consensus is reached on forming a unity government.
“We can’t tear up our constitution,” he said in his statement. “We can’t allow fascists to take over. We must end this fascist threat to democracy,” he said, adding that the official buildings occupied by protesters must be returned to state control.
The protesters’ actions were a repeat of the capture of President Gotabaya Raja­paksa’s home and office on Saturday, when Wickre­mesinghe’s private home was also set ablaze.
Earlier on Wednesday, smiling Sri Lankans again thronged the corridors of the president’s official residence after his departure, with young couples walking around hand in hand in a mood of quiet celebration.

2,China claims it ‘drove away’ US destroyer,"US Navy says destroyer “asserted navigational rights and freedoms"" in South China Sea, ""consistent with international law”.","BEIJING: A US destroyer sailed near the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea on Wednesday, drawing an angry reaction from Beijing, which said its military had “driven away” the ship after it illegally entered territorial waters.
The United States regularly carries out what it calls Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea challenging what it says are ‘restrictions on innocent passage’ imposed by China and other claimants.
Monday marked the sixth anniversary of a ruling by an international tribunal that invalidated China’s sweeping claims to the South China Sea, a conduit for about $3 trillion worth of ship-borne trade each year. China has never accepted the ruling.
The US Navy said the destroyer USS Benfold “asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the South China Sea near the Paracel Islands, consistent with international law”.
China says it does not impede freedom of navigation or overflight, accusing the United States of deliberately provoking tensions.
The People’s Liberation Army’s Southern Theatre Command said the US ship’s actions seriously violated China’s sovereignty and security by illegally entering China’s territorial waters around the Paracels, which are also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan.
“The PLA’s Southern Theatre Command organised sea and air forces to follow, monitor, warn and drive away” the ship, it added, showing pictures of the Benfold taken from the deck of the Chinese frigate the Xianning.
“The facts once again show that the United States is nothing short of a ‘security risk maker in the South China Sea’ and a ‘destroyer of regional peace and stability’.”
The US Navy said the Chinese statement on the mission was “false” and the latest in a long string of Chinese actions to “misrepresent lawful US maritime operations and assert its excessive and illegitimate maritime claims at the expense of its Southeastern Asian neighbours in the South China Sea”.

3,Video shows hesitant police response to Uvalde school shooting in US,Video shows police waiting for over an hour before breaching classroom where a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers.,"

WASHINGTON: A video of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, surfaced on Tuesday showed police waiting for more than an hour before breaching a classroom where a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers.
Steve McCraw, Texas’s public safety chief, has described the police response to the May 24 attack as an “abject failure” and said officers wasted vital time looking for a classroom key that was “never needed”.
Surveillance camera video obtained by the Austin American-Statesman newspaper and local TV station KVUE shows the 18-year-old gunman crashing his truck outside Robb Elementary School and then entering the building at 11:33am armed with a semi-automatic rifle.
As he walks down an empty hallway, a young boy spots him from around a corner and rushes away as the gunman opens fire into a classroom. The camera catches the gunman shooting dozens of rounds from the doorway before going inside. He steps out briefly into the view of the camera, reenters the classroom and is not seen again.
Several police officers armed with handguns are seen arriving in the school hallway within three minutes of the first shots being fired. They go down the hallway where the shooting is taking place but retreat when the gunman opens fire from the classroom.
For the next hour the police are seen huddling at the end of the hallway while reinforcements arrive, including officers armed with semi-automatic weapons and ballistic shields.
At 12:21pm, 45 minutes after the arrival of the first officers on the scene, shots could be heard from where the gunman was holed up. The officers eventually stormed the classroom at 12:50pm and killed the gunman — one hour and 14 minutes after their arrival.
The video does not show any children being shot and the Austin American-Statesman said it had removed audio of their screams. Its public release was met with outrage by some in the community.
Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin, speaking at a town council meeting, called it “one of the most chicken things I’ve seen”. He said that the video was not meant to be released until after victims’ families had a chance to view it, and that it was meant to be edited down. “They didn’t need to see the gunman coming in and hear the gunshots. They don’t need to relive that, they’ve been through enough.”
McCraw, Texas’s public safety chief, told a state senate hearing in June that police had enough officers to stop the shooter three minutes after he entered the school.
On-scene commander Pete Arredondo had “decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children,” McCraw said.
“The officers had weapons, the children had none. The officers had body armour, the children had none. The officers had training, the subject had none,” he testified.
Arredondo had claimed that the classroom door was locked, delaying their move on the shooter, but McCraw told the inquiry that was not believed to be the case.
“He waited for a key that was never needed,” said the official.
McCraw told the inquiry that Arredondo, who has since been suspended, had made “terrible decisions”. He said the response ran counter to lessons learned since the Columbine high school shooting that left 13 people dead in 1999.
The Uvalde shooting, America’s worst school shooting in a decade, came 10 days after an 18-year-old used an AR-15-type assault rifle to kill 10 African Americans at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York.

4,Restoration of power supply from Neelum-Jhelum project ordered,PM Shehbaz expresses annoyance over technical failure of project that suspended electricity supply to national grid.,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday took notice of a technical fault in the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project and directed relevant departments to ensure immediate restoration of power supply from the project.
The prime minister, who chaired a meeting on the matter, expressed annoyance over the technical failure of the project which suspended the supply of environment-friendly electricity to the national grid during the peak summer season.
The meeting was told that power production from the project had been affected owing to the closure of 3km tailrace water tunnel.
The prime minister directed the authorities concerned to hold an inquiry into the incident through a reputable international organisation besides ensuring restoration of the power plant.
He said all resources should be utilised to provide relief to the people without delay.
The prime minister told the meeting that the government was about to introduce an effective mechanism for pre-qualification, third party monitoring and evaluation of companies to ensure transparency and quality of the development projects.
Minister for Energy Khurram Dastgir, Adviser to PM Ahad Cheema, Member of National Assembly Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and relevant senior officers attended the meeting.
Lahore team lauded
Meanwhile, the prime minister expressed satisfaction over the arrangements made by the Punjab government for disposal of offal and waste in Lahore during Eidul Azha holidays and lauded the team of officials and workers for their services.

5,Biden greeted as ‘old friend’ in Israel at start of Middle East tour,"“You do not need to be a Jew to be a Zionist,” he says, voicing support for the ideology behind Israel’s foundation.","TEL AVIV: US President Joe Biden arrived on Wednesday in Israel, which embraced him as an old friend on the first leg of a high-stakes trip dominated by efforts to bring it closer to Saudi Arabia and to persuade Washington’s Gulf allies to pump more oil.
Landing at Ben Gurion Airport, whose tarmac he first trod in 1973 as a senator, Biden bumped fists with Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid and President Isaac Herzog and, in a speech, described the connection between the two nations as “bone-deep”.
“You do not need to be a Jew to be a Zionist,” Biden added, voicing support for the ideology behind Israel’s foundation on lands with ancient Jewish roots, and which is deeply resented by many Palestinians.
Biden also reiterated US desire for negotiations, stalled since 2014, to create a Palestinian state on Israeli-occupied territory, calling this two state solution “the best hope” for both peoples.

US president to meet Palestinian counterpart today before flying to Jeddah for talks with Saudi officials

Biden’s first visit to Israel as president is his tenth of a long political career. Israel has stepped carefully around disputes with Washington over Iranian nuclear diplomacy and long-stalled Palestinian statehood negotiations.
“Your relationship with Israel has always been personal,” Lapid said in a speech, calling Biden “one of the best friends Israel has ever known”.
Biden will spend two days in Jerusalem before meeting Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Friday in the occupied West Bank. He will then fly directly from Israel to Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, for talks with Saudi officials and to attend a summit of Gulf allies.
US officials say the trip could produce more steps toward normalisation between Israel and Saudi Arabia, historic foes but also two of America’s strongest allies in the turbulent region.
That would build on the establishing or upgrading of Israeli relations with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco under a 2020 US initiative, dubbed the Abraham Accords, after the biblical patriarch revered by both Jews and Muslims.
Biden’s trip aims to promote regional stability, deepen Israel’s integration in the region and counter Iranian influence and aggression by Russia and China.
However, Iran said Biden’s trip to the Middle East will not bring about security for Israel, the Islamic republic’s regional arch-enemy. “If the visits of the American officials to the countries of the region are to strengthen the position of the Zionist regime and to normalise the relations of this regime with some countries, their efforts will not create security for the Zionists in any way,” President Ebrahim Raisi said in a statement, referring to Israel.
Biden, under pressure at home to bring down soaring gasoline prices that have damaged his standing in public opinion polls, is expected to press Gulf allies to expand oil production.
A centerpiece of Biden’s visit will be talks in Jeddah with Saudi leaders, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, accused by the US intelligence community of being behind the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

6,Families of Saudi detainees await Biden,Want US president to lobby for release of loved ones jailed in a crackdown on dissent in Saudi Arabia.,"RIYADH: Malik al-Dowaish was arrested this month following years of campaigning for the release of his father, who was himself detained in 2016 after he gave a sermon seen as critical of the Saudi Arabian royal family, two sources familiar with the matter said.
“I really don’t know the secret behind my father’s arrest,” Dowaish said, in a video that he recorded before his arrest and seen by Reuters. “But it is very strange that he has not been tried so that a court could look at any charges that have been brought against him.”
Dowaish’s relatives are among hundreds of Saudis who want US President Joe Biden to lobby for the release of loved ones jailed in a crackdown on dissent when he visits Washington’s most important Arab ally this week.
But some relatives of detained Saudis said they fear human rights will not be on the top of his agenda when he meets Saudi leaders.
In a July 9 Washington Post commentary, Biden wrote that fundamental freedoms are always “on the agenda” when he travels abroad.
Saudi officials say the kingdom does not have political prisoners. They deny human right abuses and say they are only fighting extremism, corruption and safeguarding the kingdom’s national security.
Dowaish’s plight is part of a crackdown on dissent that has been driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman even as he has championed reforms like allowing women to drive and pushed projects to create jobs.
Lina al-Hathloul, sister of Loujain al-Hathloul, a women’s rights activist who served a prison sentence and remains under a travel ban, doubts Saudi leaders will soften their positions in the wake of Biden’s visit. “Loujain is in another prison, she is monitored and she feels isolated because people are scared to be seen with her. It’s a state that cannot be called freedom,” she said.
Bader al-Ibrahim, an epidemiologist and journalist, and Salah al-Haidar, a media commentator whose mother Aziza al-Yousef is a women’s rights campaigner, will be among the Saudi cases closely watched during Biden’s trip. Both are US citizens, who were freed from jail but still banned from travel.
