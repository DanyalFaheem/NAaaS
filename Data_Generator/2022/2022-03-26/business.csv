0,ECC approves increase in premium for diesel imports,"The summary was meant to “facilitate and provide level playing field to oil companies vis-à-vis PSO”, says statement.","ISLAMABAD: For ensuring diesel availability in the harvesting season amid volatile international market, the government on Friday allowed an increase in premium charged to Pakistani importers by spot traders for three months i.e. April-June.
The decision to this effect was taken at a hurriedly called special meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet presided over by Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin. The single-point meeting of the ECC was called at a short notice in the morning to address a challenging market situation.
A senior government official said the ECC directed that there should be no shortage of product even if it was procured at a higher premium as a part of the impact of higher premiums would be adjusted within the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) by the regulator and remaining to be picked up by the government. 
All petroleum prices, including high-speed diesel (HSD), have already been frozen for four months by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
Only three members, out of 14, of the ECC attended the meeting. They included Minister National Food Security & Research Syed Fakhar Imam and Minister for Privatisation Muhammad Mian Soomro.
An official statement said the summary, moved by Petroleum Division, was meant to “facilitate and provide level playing field to oil companies vis-à-vis PSO” and was approved with the direction to revise the premium on a fortnightly basis. “Therefore, its impact would increase or decrease depending on the international energy market,” it added.
Under the decision, the HSD price calculation would not be based on the premium being charged by Pakistan State Oil’s long-term supplier – Kuwait Petroleum Company (KPC) – but on an average of prevailing market-based premium.
The meeting was informed that under the existing pricing mechanism for HSD and petrol, the base price is fixed on the basis of 15 days average FOB (freight on board) prices of the Arab Gulf market (published in the Platts Oilgram). For this base price, PSO’s last available average import premium and Incidental charges (including bank charges for letters of credit, wharfage, port charges, etc) are added to arrive at C&F (cost and freight) prices for finalizing the local consumer prices.
The premium (freight and supplier’s margin) is a lump sum cost of the supplier/exporter, which is either negotiated or offered in a tender process. PSO, being a public sector company, is obligated to procure imports under the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and regulations.
As per existing arrangements, PSO imports its petrol requirements entirely through spot tendering, while the bulk of its HSD imports is made from KPC on the basis of a long-term agreement, which is revised or reviewed biannually. The premium on a long-term basis is lesser than the tendered premium. Presently, KPC premium for PSO’s HSD cargoes for January-June is $2.40 per barrel. In case, KPC is unable to meet PSO’s HSD demand, the additional imports are procured from the spot market. When PSO procures from both sources (KPC & spot market), the weighted average of KPC and spot premium is used as a benchmark to calculate the consumer prices.
However, the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) had pointed to the government that HSD premiums for the industry had been historically higher than PSO, implying that the industry was importing HSD at a relatively higher premium as compared to PSO’s benchmark premium. Due to this, the remaining OMCs are at a disadvantage.
This difference has now risen significantly due to the prevailing geopolitical situation. PSO’s tender for the second fortnight of this month opened at $8.45 per barrel whereas premiums are even higher in the open market. The situation was such that PSO did not receive any offer in their HSD tender for the first fortnight of April.
Since the current HSD price was benchmarked on the basis of substantial imports by PSO from KPC ($2.4 per barrel), any oil marketing company importing at the PSO tendered premium ($8.45 per barrel) would incur a loss of up to Rs6.8 per litre, creating an unsustainable position for importers. “Therefore, the need for urgent review the benchmarking process to save the industry from collapse”, the Petroleum Division pleaded insisting that OMCs would be unable to import HSD leading to a potential shortage across the country.
The ECC approved the summary that KPC premium be excluded from price computation for the period from April to June and premium be benchmarked on PSO’s average tendered premium for the previous fortnight. 
In case, there is no tender by PSO in a particular fortnight, the premium from the previous tender would be used for calculating HSD ex-refinery price.
As this arrangement may lead to some benefits for PSO and local refineries, this would be adjusted by Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority for recovery through the IFEM mechanism. This mechanism would be reviewed on the recommendation of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority on a fortnightly basis.

1,"Cooking oil, ghee prices close to Rs500",Shaukat Tarin announces 10pc tax relief on palm oil imports.,"KARACHI: As Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin on Friday approved a 10 per cent tax cut on the import of edible oil for April and May, the prices of ghee and cooking oil have already reached close to Rs500 per kg/litre ahead of Ramazan due to soaring palm oil rates and rupee devaluation against the dollar.
The prices of branded ghee and cooking oil are in the range of Rs440-490 per kg/litre in the market, Karachi Retail Grocers Group (KRGG) general secretary Farid Qureishi said, adding that people are compromising on the quality owing to a steep rise in prices.
Shaukat Tarin on Friday approved the relief to check the rising trend in ghee and cooking oil prices and deal with the expected shortfall in the holy month.

Tarin announces 10pc tax relief on palm oil imports

The tax relief measure on the import of edible oil is being undertaken for the short-term to ensure a smooth supply of edible oil to consumers as 90pc of the nation’s annual demand for ghee/cooking oil is met through imports.
Commenting on the relief, Senior Vice Chairman Pakistan Vanaspati Manufacturers Association (PVMA) Sheikh Amjad Rasheed said confusion has gripped the edible oil market after the government’s decision of providing a tax relief of 10pc on the edible oil imports.
He said this is the first time in my 40 years of experience that sales of ghee and cooking oil have been showing depressed trend due to high prices and squeezing purchasing power of people.
He said palm oil stocks had also never fallen to 150,000 tonnes at the port from the normal stocks of 250,000 tonnes ahead of Ramazan due to reluctance of industry and traders towards import of palm oil because of persistent rupee fall against the dollar and soaring palm oil rates in the world market.
He elaborated that the cumulative impact of duties and taxes comes to Rs95,000 per tonne on import of palm oil-based on the current palm oil rate of $1,700 per tonne on which customs duty is Rs9,180 per tonne on palm oil followed by 17pc general sales tax, 2pc income tax, 2pc additional customs duty and value-addition tax.
Assuming that the government has provided tax relief of 10pc on cumulative cost of import of palm oil then it would bring down the price by Rs10 per kg/litre on ghee and cooking oil which cannot be termed as a relief, Amjad said, adding that “this is too little, too late.”

2,Private sector borrowings swell to Rs911bn,The increase in terms of percentage is the biggest growth in the last five years.,"KARACHI: The private sector credit off-take jumped by 155 per cent to Rs911 billion during the July-mid March period compared to Rs357bn in the same period of last fiscal year, data shared by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed on Friday.
The increase in borrowings indicates higher economic activities that could lead to achieving the growth target set by the government.
The increase in terms of percentage is the biggest growth in the last five years while it has already crossed the total private sector credit off-take witnessed in FY21 when Rs766bn was borrowed. Initially, growth was announced at 3.9pc but later it was reviewed by National Accounts Committee which found the growth as 5.37pc in FY21. It was unexpected for most analysts and economists and the growth rate was termed as surprising.
The SBP in its last monetary policy predicted that the economic growth rate could be in the mid of 4-5pc for FY22 which is encouraging for the government facing challenges of Covid-19 pandemic, record oil and commodity prices and huge traded deficit.
The higher oil prices and costly imports increased inflation ultimately forcing the SBP to increase interest rate which is currently at 9.75pc. Despite costly borrowings, the private sector kept increasing its economic activities which are reflected from the credit off-take during FY22.
The conventional banks were at the forefront as they extended loans worth Rs567bn to the private sector during this period which was much higher than Rs174bn credit off-take during the same period in FY21.
The Islamic banks also increased their lending to the private sector but the size of the increase was much less than conventional banks. The lending to the private sector by Islamic banks reached Rs127bn during this period compared to Rs71bn in the same period in FY21.
The lending to the private sector by Islamic branches of the conventional banks was double than the previous fiscal year. These branches extended loans worth Rs217bn compared to Rs111bn in the same period in FY21.
The current private sector credit off-take has surpassed the total loans extended in the entire FY21. In the previous fiscal year, the private sector credit off-take was Rs766bn.
Some banking analysts believe that the private sector is getting higher loans due to low intake by the federal government from the banking system while deposits also increased this year. 
This created higher liquidity for the banks, forcing them to lend maximum to the private sector.

5,Jugnu raises $22.5m in Series A round,"The startup has already connected more than 30,000 kiryana stores and SMEs directly with manufacturers through its app.","KARACHI: Systems Ltd said on Friday its associate company Jugnu, a business-to-business e-commerce platform, has raised $22.5 million in Series A, which is the first round of financing undertaken for a new business after seed capital.
The startup, which helps kiryana stores connect directly with large suppliers and manufacturers, raised the funding after entering a strategic alliance with Sary, a Middle East and North Africa–based online commerce marketplace.
“Earlier, Systems Ltd made an equity investment in Retailistan, the parent company of Jugnu, acquiring a 20 per cent stake in the business, joining hands with the now-progressing retail accelerator,” the company said in a stock filing.
The country’s tech sector has seen a flurry of activity in recent years, with startups raising a total of $563.5m in 255 deals from 2015 to date. They raised $350m via 83 deals in 2021 alone, according to the recently released Pakistan Startup Ecosystem Report 2021.
The report said Pakistani startups typically raise between $1m and $11m at the Series A stage, which means the $22.5m financing raised by Jugnu is substantially high given the local e-commerce landscape.
Jugnu has already connected more than 30,000 kiryana stores and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) directly with manufacturers through its app to address digitisation challenges across the e-commerce industry. “With Systems Ltd as a catalyst for growth, Jugnu can upscale the digital retail landscap on all fronts,” it added.
The strategic investment in the Series A round was led by Sary and had participation from Sarmayacar and Systems Ltd. “[It] will enable Jugnu to... strengthen the retail supply chain, lighting up the livelihoods of one million-plus SMEs that constitute a sizable chunk of Pakistan’s economy,” it said.
Pakistan has over 1m kiryana stores that lack access to convenient inventory procurement. Over two-thirds of the retail stores are never serviced directly by any organised distribution channel.
