0,New EU law leaves Big Tech facing major rethink,"The law fights their ability to “lock consumers into their ecosystem” by sheer force of market share, says researcher.","PARIS: From Amazon shoppers to iPhone owners, the world faces a rethink in the way it interacts with Big Tech, thanks to a new law agreed by the European Union on Thursday.
The Digital Markets Act tries to ensure smaller players will be able to enter the market without Silicon Valley behemoths stomping on them before they get off the ground.
It fights their ability to “lock consumers into their ecosystem” by sheer force of market share, says Pierre-Jean Benghozi of French research institute CNRS. That ethos is at the heart of one of the most eye-catching proposals — to ensure “interoperability” between messaging apps.
Essentially, this means WhatsApp users, for example, could ditch the app, but continue conversations with friends later by using iMessenger, Signal or another app.
WhatsApp, in the stable of Facebook owner Meta, has maintained a stranglehold on the market at least partially because so many people already use it.
If it no longer has that appeal, it is not hard to see users moving away to other apps.
‘Landmark law’
Sonia Cisse, a specialist lawyer from the Linklaters firm, highlights provisions in the act that would stop large platforms from promoting their own services ahead of those of their rivals.
“This is an issue for Google,” she says. “If you type ‘travel’ into your search bar, for example, you will no longer come across the trips offered by Google.” Amazon has also long been accused of promoting its own products.
Those practices will be illegal if the DMA passes in its current form.
Apple, too, faces some of its domination being squashed.
It will no longer be able to force customers to buy and sell apps using its in-house payment system, and users will be able to delete the Safari browser that comes as standard on its iPhones.
Maya Noel, of the Digital France group that lobbies for startups, says these kinds of rules could change the landscape entirely for smaller developers.
App stores “will no longer be able to force them to go through their identification system, their payment system, or prevent them from advertising directly”, she explains.
Ursula Pachl of the European Consumer Organisation called it a “landmark law for the EU’s digital transformation”. “But Member States must now also provide the Commission with the necessary enforcement resources to step in the moment there is foul play,” she said.
In the past, big EU legislation has suffered from patchy enforcement. The huge data privacy regulation (GDPR) came into force in 2018 and empowered regulators across the bloc to issue huge fines.
But activists have long lamented the slow pace of action, with cases taking years to grind through the system.
Maya Noel hopes the DMA will be different.
She says an app developer, for example, should be able to get a very quick response to a report of non-compliance.
The complainant will no longer need to prove that the big firm is abusing its dominant position.
Instead, it will be enough to show that one of the mandatory rules of the DMA has been violated.
The industry, of course, is far from happy.
“The DMA borrows remedies from ongoing competition enforcement cases, but applies them inflexibly and on a one-size-fits-all basis to all platform services of companies designated as ‘gatekeepers’,” said the CCIA, an industry lobby group. Lawyer Sonia Cisse also wonders whether the law has gone too far.
“It’s a bit like the GDPR,” she says. “It’s designed for the very big players, but other smaller ones get caught in the net.”

1,UN calls for improving access to reproductive health care,"Says women in Pakistan have an estimated 3.8m unintended 
pregnancies each year","UNITED NATIONS: The first-ever model-based estimates of unintended pregnancy and abortion rates for 150 countries shows major disparities in access to sexual and reproductive health care.
The UN’s Human Reproduction Programme (HRP), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and a WHO partner Guttmacher Institute jointly released the report on Thursday, highlighting the discrepancies. The study analyses rates from 2015 to 2019, with the aim of providing deeper insights into access to sexual and reproductive health services in countries of all income levels across the globe.
The data used for the study shows that the prevalence of unintended pregnancies in Pakistan is between 16-46 per cent. Women in Pakistan have an estimated 3.8 million unintended pregnancies each year, most of which result from unmet need for modern contraception. About 52pc of married women of reproductive age (15–49) who want to avoid a pregnancy are not using a modern contraceptive method.

Says women in Pakistan have an estimated 3.8m unintended pregnancies each year

“If all unmet need for modern contraception were met, there would be 3.1 million fewer unintended pregnancies annually, 2.1 million fewer induced abortions and nearly 1,000 fewer maternal deaths,” says an earlier report by the Guttmacher Institute.
Modern contraceptive services and maternal and newborn health care are essential for protecting the health of Pakistani women, their families and communities.
The report released on Thursday shows that the greatest variations in unintended pregnancies are in Latin America where the rates ranged from 41 to 107 per 1,000 women, and in sub-Saharan Africa, where the range was 49 to 145 women per 1,000.
The report points out that the disparities are not shaped purely by income-level: in Europe, for example, most countries with higher unintended pregnancy rates than the regional average are classified as high-income, while the two countries with the lowest estimates are middle-income. The finding reflects how barriers to accessing and using effective sexual and reproductive healthcare exist in settings with greater as well as fewer resources.
“These variations speak to the need for investment, even in regions with low unintended pregnancy rates,” says Jonathan Bearak, a senior research scientist at Guttmacher Institute and lead author of the article. He also underlines the need to empower women and girls across countries to choose under what circumstances they want to have children.
“The proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion — as great as 68pc, even among countries that completely prohibited abortion—illustrates the strength of the desire of millions of women and adolescents to avoid unplanned childbearing,” the author argues.

2,"Taliban fear educated women, quip schoolgirls","""Afghanistan has turned into a jail for us,"" says 11-year-old girl.","KABUL: Days after the Taliban staged a cruel U-turn on allowing Afghan girls back to school, Adeeba Haidari feels as if she is in prison. 
The 13-year-old was one of thousands of jubilant girls who flocked back to secondary schools reopening across the country on Wednesday, for the first time since the Taliban seized power in August. 
But just hours into classes, the education ministry announced a shock policy reversal that left schoolgirls feeling betrayed and the international community outraged. 
“Not only me but everyone you asked believed that the Taliban had changed,” said Adeeba, who briefly returned to Al Fatah Girls School in the capital, Kabul. 
“When they sent everyone back home from school, we understood that the Taliban were the same Taliban of 25 years ago,” her 11-year-old sister Malahat added.
“We are being treated like criminals just because we are girls. Afghanistan has turned into a jail for us.” 
When the Taliban returned to power, they promised a softer rule compared with their first regime from 1996 to 2001, which became notorious for human rights abuses. 
They claimed to respect women’s rights, in line with their interpretation of Islamic sharia law, and said girls would be allowed to study through to university.
But the Taliban have imposed a slew of restrictions on women, effectively banning them from many government jobs, policing what they wear and preventing them from travelling outside of their cities alone. 
They have also detained several women’s rights activists. 
“We miss our freedom. We miss our classmates and teachers,” said Adeeba. 
‘Dreams shattered’ 
There has been no clear explanation for the last-minute reversal on secondary schools, but reports leaked from a secretive leadership meeting this week suggested motives ranging from problems with uniforms to an outright rejection of the need for education for teenage girls. 
The education ministry still insists schools will restart, but only when new guidelines are issued. 
Across town, Nargis Jafri, from the minority Shia Hazara community, said the Taliban feel threatened by educated women. “They believe that if we study, we will gain knowledge and we will fight against them,” the 14-year-old told AFP, sitting with her books spread out on her study table at home. 
It is agonising for her to watch boys her age walking past her house on their way to school each morning. “It is really hard and painful for me,” she said. 
Like many families, history is repeating itself from one generation to the next.
Nargis’s mother, Hamida, was forced to leave school during the Taliban’s first rule when she was about 10 years old. 
The stories from what she thought a distant past are flooding into her mind again. 
“I used to feel strange when she told us how she wore a burqa or a chador, or how a woman was not allowed to go out without a male relative,” Nargis said.
Hamida now struggles to accept a similar fate for her daughter. 
“My daughter will be held back from going to school,” she said. “The dreams she has in her heart will be shattered.”

3,War drives US-EU energy deal to undercut Russia,Biden offers major expansion of natural gas shipments to European countries,"BRUSSELS: With stunning speed, Russia’s war in Ukraine is driving Western Europe into the outstretched arms of the United States again, especially apparent when President Joe Biden offered a major expansion of natural gas shipments to his European Union counterpart Friday.
Talking to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Biden said the core issue was helping Europe reduce its dependency on Russian gas as quickly as possible. And Europe, which relies on Moscow for 40 per cent of the natural gas used to heat homes, generate electricity and drive industry, needs the help.
An economic miscalculation with massive geopolitical consequences, many European Union nations let themselves become ever more reliant on Russian fossil fuels over the years, vainly hoping trade would overcome Cold War enmity on a continent too often riven by conflict.

Biden offers major expansion of natural gas shipments to European countries

That longstanding practice meant the 27-nation bloc could not simply stop Russian energy imports as part of Western sanctions to punish Moscow for the invasion a month ago.
And changing energy policy is about as cumbersome as turning around a liquefied natural gas carrier on a rough sea. In reality, it will take years.
This is where Biden stepped in Friday. Under the plan, the United States and a few like-minded partners will increase exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, to Europe by 15 billion cubic meters this year. Those exports would triple in the years afterward, a necessary move if the EU can back up its claim to be rid of Russian imports in five years.

The bloodshed is certain to fuel allegations Moscow has committed war crimes by killing civilians, whether deliberately or by indiscriminate fire. For days, the government in the besieged and ruined port city was unable to give a casualty count for the March 16 bombardment of the grand, columned Mariupol Drama Theatre, where hundreds of people were taking cover, the word CHILDREN printed in Russian in huge white letters on the ground outside to ward off aerial attack.

5,Australia declares ‘mass bleaching’ at Great Barrier Reef,SYDNEY: Australia’s spe­c­tacular Great Barrier Reef is suffering “mass blea­ching” as corals lose their...,"SYDNEY: Australia’s spe­c­tacular Great Barrier Reef is suffering “mass blea­ching” as corals lose their colour under the stress of warmer seas, authorities said on Friday, in a blow widely blamed on climate change.
The world’s largest coral reef system, stretching for more than 2,300 kilometres along the northeast coast of Australia, is showing the harmful effects of the heat, said the Reef Authority.
Aerial surveys detected coral bleaching at multiple reefs across a large area of the system, “confirming a mass bleaching event, the fourth since 2016,” it said in a report.
The Great Barrier Reef, home to some 1,500 species of fish and 4,000 types of mollusc, was suffering despite the cooling effect of the La Nina weather phenomenon, which is currently influencing Australia’s climate, the authority said.
The area, which comprises about 2,500 individual reefs and more than 900 islands, suffers from bleaching when corals expel algae living in their tissues, draining them of their vibrant colours.
Though bleached corals are under stress, they can still recover if conditions become more moderate, the Reef Authority said.
“Weather patterns over the next couple of weeks continue to remain critical in determining the overall extent and severity of coral bleaching across the Marine Park,” it said. 
The mass bleaching report emerged four days after the United Nations began a monitoring mission to assess whether the World Heritage site is being protected from climate change.
Unesco’s mission is to assess whether the Austr­alian government is doing enough to address threats to the Great Barrier Reef — including climate change — before the World Heritage Committee considers listing it as “in danger” in June. “The beloved, vibrant colours of the Great Barrier Reef are being replaced by ghostly white coral,” said Greenpeace Australia climate impact activist Martin Zavan.
He pressed the government to show the damaged areas to the UN mission now inspecting the reef rather than the picturesque areas that have been untouched.
“If the government is genuine about letting the UN mission form a comprehensive picture of the state of the Reef, then it must take the mission to the northern and central Reef,” Zavan said.
“Here, corals are being cooked by temperatures up to four degrees above average, which is particularly alarming during a La Nina year when ocean temperatures are cooler.” The World Heritage Committee’s decision to not list the Great Barrier Reef as being in danger last July surprised many, given Unesco had recommended the listing weeks earlier.
When the UN previously threatened to downgrade the reef’s World Heritage listing in 2015, Australia created a “Reef 2050” plan and poured billions of dollars into protection.
Amanda McKenzie, chief executive of Australian climate action body the Climate Council, said the world’s oceans reached record high temperatures last year.
“Unfortunately, as more severe bleaching is reported across our beloved Great Bar­rier Reef, we can see these devastating events are beco­ming more common under the continuing high rate of greenhouse gas emissions,” she said. “To give our Reef a fighting chance, we must deal with the number one problem: climate change. No amount of funding will stop these bleaching events unl­ess we drive down our emissions this decade.”

6,Giant white diamond ‘The Rock’ makes debut in Dubai,DUBAI: A giant diamond nicknamed “The Rock” went on display for the first time in Dubai on Friday ahead of an...,"DUBAI: A giant diamond nicknamed “The Rock” went on display for the first time in Dubai on Friday ahead of an auction where it is expected to fetch over $30 million.
The 228.31-carat pear-shaped gem, which was mined and polished in South Africa more than 20 years ago, is the largest white diamond ever to come to auction, said Christie’s.
After making its debut at the auction house’s Dubai branch, where it will be displayed from March 26-29, The Rock will travel to Taipei, New York and Geneva, where it will be auctioned on May 11.
“The Middle East has always had such a great appreciation for important jewels and gemstones,” Rahul Kadakia, international head of jewellery at Christie’s, told AFP.
“We thought it would be nice for us to launch the diamond in an area where there are so many great collectors for important gems of this nature.” The diamond is the “largest existing D-Z colour pear-shaped diamond ever graded” by the Gemological Institute of America, Christie’s said in a statement, adding it is “G colour, VS1 clarity”.
“It’s the biggest white diamond ever sold at auction, it will probably achieve over 30 million dollars,” said Julian Brunie, Christie’s international head of jewellery private sales.
“We have seen a lot of demand in the region in the last few years... the UAE and the Gulf area has always been a key market for the unique pieces.” The previous auction record for the largest colourless diamond was a 163.41 carat sparkler which sold in November 2017 for $33.7 million, Christie’s said.
Sotheby’s in London last month sold “The Enigma” — the largest cut black diamond ever to come to auction, at 555.55 carats — for $4.3 million.

7,Chinese foreign minister nudges India to look beyond border dispute,Delhi puts disengagement as precondition for normal ties.,"NEW DELHI: China and India offered varying readouts of a meeting between their foreign ministers on Friday, with New Delhi stressing border disengagement as a precondition for normal relations and Beijing underscoring the need to join hands at the time of global turbulence with a view to making Asia’s future invincible.  
After arriving in New Delhi on Thursday evening, the visit wrapped in secrecy due to an unannounced stopover in Kabul en route, Foreign Minister Wang Yi held talks with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and India’s National Security Adviser Ajit Doval on Friday.  
There was speculation whether Mr Wang would invite India to a conference China is to host with neighbours of Afghanistan, but it appears from Mr Jaishankar’s remarks that this was not to be. An important date later this year is a meeting of the BRICS leaders in China, an occasion for Russia to consolidate and explain its position on the ongoing hostilities between Moscow and Nato in and over Ukraine.  

Delhi puts disengagement as precondition for normal ties

According to China’s Global Times, Mr Wang proposed a three-point approach to India - both sides should view bilateral relations with a long-term vision, see each other’s development with a win-win mentality, and take part in the multilateral process with a cooperative posture.   
Mr Wang is the highest-level Chinese official to visit India since the border clashes at Galwan Valley. He told Mr Jaishankar that as mature, rational and major developing countries, China and India should not let the border issue define or affect the overall development of the bilateral relationship. 
“China and India should support each other, not consume or exclude each other. The two sides should manage and control differences, and facilitate the development of bilateral relations,” Global Times quoted Mr Wang as saying. 
Mr Jaishankar, according to the paper, said that since last year, India and China have maintained effective diplomatic and military communication. After several rounds of military commander-level talks and border affairs mechanism meetings, troops of the two sides have achieved disengagement in most areas of the western sector of the border, and the disengagement in the remaining areas should be completed as soon as possible.  
The Indian media offered a different emphasis. “There can be no normality in India-China ties unless the troops amassed at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) are withdrawn,” local reports quoted Mr Jaishankar as telling the visitor. Mr Jaishankar, according to The Hindu, said their meeting had a “broad and substantive agenda” and the talks were “open and candid”. He said he had “conveyed our national sentiment” on the border issue and that “frictions and tensions that arise from China’s deployments since April 2020 cannot be reconciled with a normal relationship between two neighbours”.
“If you ask me, is our relationship normal today, my answer to you is no, it is not, and it cannot be normal if the situation in the border areas is abnormal,” Mr Jaishankar replied to a question from The Hindu, referring to the LAC in eastern Ladakh, where around 100,000 Indian and Chinese soldiers remain deployed in forward areas.   
“Surely, the presence of a large number of troops there, in contravention of agreements, is abnormal,” he said.

8,Man freed by Iran ‘angry’ at UK govt over detention,LONDON: One of the British-Iranian detainees released by Tehran last week said he was “angry” that the UK...,"LONDON: One of the British-Iranian detainees released by Tehran last week said he was “angry” that the UK government did not act sooner, and accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of “opportunism”.
Retired engineer Anoosheh Ashoori, 68, was arrested in August 2017 while visiting his elderly mother in Tehran and jailed for 10 years on charges of spying for Israel.
He and charity worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was detained for six years, arrived home last week after London settled a $520-million debt dating back to the time of the Shah of Iran. Ashoori told Sky News in an interview broadcast on Thursday night that Johnson, who was foreign secretary when he was detained, ignored his wife’s pleas to meet about his case.
“She made many attempts and all of them were unsuccessful,” he said, but added that Johnson had now sent them a letter and was “eager to see us”. “I think that it’s a bit of opportunism,” he said.
Ashoori, from south London, has always denied the charges against him, and revealed that he had sent a voice message to the prime minister while he was detained.
“I was blaming those who had captured us, I was blaming the British government, why don’t you do anything about it?” he told the broadcaster.
“I was really angry and that’s why I decided to send that voice message hoping that it would make a change.” Ashoori said he agreed with Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s comments during a press conference this week in which she said that she should have been released six years ago. “She should have been here years ago if that debt was paid.” In a separate interview with The Guardian newspaper, he said the foreign ministry advised the family for two years not to comment publicly on his detention.

9,North Korea has ‘likely more in store’ after missile test: US,"“We see this as part of a pattern of testing and provocation from North Korea,” says official.","SEOUL: North Korea likely has “more in store” after successfully test-firing its largest-ever intercontinental ballistic missile this week, a top White House official said on Friday.
Thursday’s launch was the first time Pyongyang has fired Kim Jong Un’s most powerful missiles at full range since 2017.
It was conducted under Kim’s “direct guidance”, and ensures his country is ready for “long-standing confrontation” with the US, state media outlet KCNA reported Friday.
“We see this as part of a pattern of testing and provocation from North Korea... we think there is likely more in store,” White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters on board Air Force One.
The missile appears to have travelled higher and further than any previous ICBM tested by the nuclear-armed country — including one designed to strike anywhere on the US mainland.
State media photographs showed Kim, wearing his customary black leather jacket and dark sunglasses, striding across the tarmac in front of a huge missile, with other images of him cheering and celebrating the test launch with uniformed military top brass.
Known as the Hwasong-17, the giant ICBM was first unveiled in October 2020 and dubbed a “monster missile” by analysts.
It had never previously been successfully test-fired, and the launch prompted immediate outrage from Pyongyang’s neighbours and the United States.
“The missile, launched at Pyong­yang International Airport, travelled up to a maximum altitude of 6,248.5 km and flew a distance of 1,090 km for 4,052s before accurately hitting the pre-set area in open waters” in the Sea of Japan, KCNA said.
South Korea’s military had estimated the range of the Thursday launch as 6,200 kilometres — far longer than the last ICBM, the Hwasong-15, which North Korea tested in November 2017.
The missile landed in Japan’s exclusive economic zone, prompting anger from Tokyo, but KCNA said the test had been carried out “in a vertical launch mode” to ease neighbours’ security concerns.
Following Thursday’s test, Washington imposed new sanctions on entities and people in Russia and North Korea who are accused of “transferring sensitive items to North Korea’s missile program”.
The North is already under biting international sanctions for its weapons programs, and the UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting over the launch on Friday.
The European Union added to the chorus of condemnation on Friday.
“This is a violation of multiple United Nations Security Council Resolutions and a serious threat to international and regional peace and security,” the bloc said in a statement, calling on Pyongyang to “refrain from any further action that could increase international or regional tensions”.
‘Important progress’
The test is a clear sign North Korea has made “important qualitative progress” on its banned weapons programmes, said US-based analyst Ankit Panda.
“What’s important about this ICBM is not how far it can go, but what it can potentially carry, which is multiple warheads,” something North Korea has long coveted, he told AFP.
“The North Koreans are on the cusp of significantly increasing the threat to the United States beyond the ICBM capability demonstrated in 2017.” Multiple warheads would help a North Korean missile evade US missile defence systems.
The North had carried out three ICBM tests prior to Thursday, the last being the Hwasong-15 in 2017.
Long-range and nuclear tests were paused when Kim and then US president Donald Trump engaged in a bout of diplomacy which collapsed in 2019. Talks have since stalled.
Thursday’s launch, one of nearly a dozen North Korean weapons tests this year, marked a dramatic return to long-range testing.
It came just days after one last week, likely also of the Hwasong-17, failed, exploding after launch.
“This test also appears to ‘compensate’ for last week’s failed projectile launch — handsomely so,” Soo Kim, RAND Corporation Policy Analyst and former CIA analyst, told AFP.
“The regime appears quite pleased with the outcome of the test,” she added. The country’s new ICBM launch comes at a delicate time for the region, with South Korea going through a presidential transition until May, and the US distracted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried a photograph of a haggard-looking Kim signing papers at his desk, with an image of a handwritten “I approve the test launch” scrawled over a report.
“Kim Jong Un wants to ultimately establish himself as a leader who has successfully developed both nuclear weapons and ICBMs,” Ahn Chan-il, a North Korean studies scholar, told AFP.
“He is almost desperate as without such military achievements, he really hasn’t done much,” he added, pointing to the isolated country’s Covid- and sanctions-battered economy.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has helped drive gas prices higher in Europe, making it more expensive for truckers to fuel up.
Also Friday, scores of farmers on tractors drove slowly along a main road near the Spanish capital of Madrid to protest the brutal increase in fuel prices and low prices they are still getting for farm produce. The Madrid region farmers also complained that the price of fertilizer, much of which in the past they say has come from Ukraine, has climbed around 300 per cent.
After 12 hours of negotiations with truckers that ended after midnight, Spain’s Socialist-led government announced it is discounting 0.20 euros per liter of gas (the equivalent of $.83 per gallon) for trucks as part of a package of measures worth more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). A liter of gas for truckers currently costs around 1.80 euros (the equivalent of $7.50 a gallon).
