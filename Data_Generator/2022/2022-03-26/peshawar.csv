0,"PTI, opposition eye big crowds from KP in Islamabad",Fazl to take vehicular procession from Dera; PTI marchers to be led by chief minister.,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is likely to play a major role in the success of power shows planned by the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement in Islamabad as both are striving to take most of their workers and supporters from the province to the federal capital.
On Friday, both PTI and PDM said they were working on strategies and making preparations to bring out most of their workers and supporters for their marches on the federal capital, where the battle for rule in Pakistan looms large.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a stronghold for both PTI and its arch rival Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl.
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who is also the president of the PDM, will lead a vehicular procession from his home district, Dera Ismail Khan, to Islamabad via the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor route. Small and big processions from southern districts will join the main procession.
In a statement issued on Friday, JUI-F provincial spokesman Abdul Jalil Jan said the party’s workers would leave Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for Islamabad on Saturday morning.
“In accordance with the decision of our central leadership, participants of the Mehangai March will stay in Islamabad for three days, including Saturday, Sunday and Monday,” he said.

Fazl to take vehicular procession from Dera; PTI marchers to be led by chief minister

Mr Jan said participants of the march from northern, southern and central regions of the province would reach the Hakla interchange at around 5pm on Saturday, where they would join the main procession, while workers from southern belt, including tribal districts, would reach Islamabad via CPEC.
He added that marchers from central districts, Malakand and Hazara regions would use the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway.
Volunteers of the Ansarul Islam, a security-cum-relief wing of the JUI-F, will escort vehicular processions from Dera Ismail Khan and Peshawar to Islamabad.
The statement said Mr Fazl’s younger brother, Maulana Attaur Rehman, and other JUI-F leaders would lead rallies from Peshawar and that the party had issued directions to its councillors to mobilise workers for the march on Islamabad.
On the other hand, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan has decided to lead the main procession of PTI from KP to Islamabad.
“Certainly, I will lead the procession from KP,” Mr Mahmood told Dawn on Friday.
He said the venue for starting the main procession had yet to be decided.
Sources said that the PTI’s core groups were meeting in Peshawar on Friday night to finalise the rally schedule.
They said the PTI rallies from different districts of the province would join the main procession at the Hekla Interchange from where the marchers would leave for Islamabad on Sunday.
The PTI parliamentary party, in a meeting on last Tuesday, had directed all ruling party MPAs, ministers and councillors to take the maximum possible number of workers from their respective areas to Islamabad.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz will take out the main procession in connection with the long march from Peshawar.
Spokesman for the PML-N and MPA Ikhtiar Wali said the party’s workers would reach the federal capital on March 28.
He said PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam would lead the main rally from Peshawar, while MNA Murtaza Javid Abbasi would lead a procession from Hazara region, which was the party’s stronghold in the province.
Also, the opposition Awami National Party and Qaumi Watan Party have chalked out own plans regarding participation in the Mehangai March.
However, the Pakistan Peoples Party’s KP chapter has yet to announce its plan regarding participation in Islamabad’s protest. A source said the PPP’s central command had yet to issue guidelines for that march.
The PPP recently organised an anti-government march from Karachi to Islamabad.

5,High court stays recruitment of KMC professor,Seeks MTI board’s response to plea for promotion of assistant professor,"PESHAWAR: Issuing a stay order, the Peshawar High Court on Friday stopped the process for the recruitment of a professor of gastroenterology at the Khyber Medical College by the Khyber Teaching Hospital, a medical teaching institute.
A bench consisting of Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Shakeel Ahmad issued the order over a petition of KMC Assistant Professor Sheema Khan seeking her promotion against the said post.
The bench also issued notices to the respondents including the MTI KTH’s Board of Governors through its chairman, asking them to respond to the plea of the petitioner on next date.
The petitioner’s counsel, Mian Muhibullah Kakakhel, argued that his client had been working as a permanent assistant professor of gastroenterology for the last 11 years without promotion.
He said the respondents, including KTH, had advertised the post of professor of gastroenterology, Khyber Medical College, Peshawar, which came under the KTH, on contractual basis, whereas the post of the professor was a permanent one.

Seeks MTI board’s response to plea for promotion of assistant professor

The lawyer contended that the petitioner had currently been working as the head of the department and the MTI, instead of promoting her, a regular employee fulfilling the professor’s criteria, was opting to bring a professor on contractual or temporary basis.
He said under the law, the petitioner was to be promoted within eight years by the department.
The counsel added that after the lapse of eight years, the promotion became mandatory and did not require assent of the department and dean.
He argued that the petitioner had earlier filed a petition, which she had withdrawn after she was promised last year that she would be considered for promotion.
The lawyer said after the withdrawal of the earlier petition, instead of promoting her as professor of Gastroenterology, Khyber Medical College, Peshawar, the post was advertised and a professor was required on temporary basis.
He said the act of the respondents was unreasonable and a temporary post of professor, who also acts as Head of the department, did not find mention in the law.
The bench, after hearing arguments of the counsel, ordered the maintaining of status quo on the advertisement and thus, stopping the recruitment process until final decision on the petition.

9,Archaeologists discover secondary gate of Bazira city,Experts also find unique artefacts during fresh excavation.,"SWAT: Archaeologists claimed to have discovered the secondary gate of Bazira city and some unique artefacts during fresh excavation in Barikot, Swat.
Led by Dr Elisa Lori, deputy director Italian archaeological mission in Pakistan, the team said that Bazira was one of the most important archaeological sites in Pakistan where excavation work had been under way since 1984.
According to archaeologists, the city was captured by Alexander in 327 BCE during his Indian campaign. Bazira is located in Barikot tehsil about 20-kilometre away from Mingora.
The experts said that they made important discoveries during the recent excavation, undertaken with the help of provincial archaeology department.

Experts also find unique artefacts during fresh excavation

“We discovered the secondary gate in the south-western stretch of the city wall that gave the ancient visitor access to the main street of the south-western neighbourhood of the city. This evidence enriches our knowledge on the history of the urban layout of the city of Barikot from the Indo-Greek to the Kushano-Sasanian period,” Dr Elisa Iori told this scribe.
She said that a large quantity of materials of different kinds were found that included coins, Kharosthi inscriptions on pottery, beads for bangles and necklaces, terracotta figurines and several relief’s fragments, representing the life of Buddha.
She said that one of the most peculiar recoveries was that of a large-sized right-spiraling ritual conch shell (about 15-centimetre long). It was found during the excavation of the Buddhist temple.
“From ancient texts and sculptures, we know that in Buddhism, as well as in ‘Hinduism’, conch shells were important ritual objects traditionally blown as trumpets during ceremonies. The recovery of such a ritual object coming from long-distance travel is quite unique in archaeological context,” she said.
Archaeology directorate representative Nasir Khattak, who was part of the team, told this scribe that the new discovery was important both in respect of architecture and chronology.
“During the previous excavations, the oldest apsidal Buddhist temple was discovered. This campaign is meant to expand it during which we have made some new discoveries but could not open the complete complex,” he said.
He said that archaeologists would try to completely open the complex in the next excavation season after Ramazan.
Last year, Italian and Pakistani archaeologists discovered the apsidal temple, which was constructed during Ashoka’s reign in the Mauryan period, around 250 BC.
