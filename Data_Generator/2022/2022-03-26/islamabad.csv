Court acquits two others for want of evidence      
Observes that victims had made resiling statements either under pressure, fear or coercion or by getting monetary benefits from accused     

ISLAMABAD: The trial court on Friday sentenced the principal accused, Usman Mirza, and his four accomplices to life imprisonment and acquitted two others for want of evidence.
The sexual harassment case had surfaced in July 2021 after a video went viral in which the accused a seen maltreating a couple.
Prime Minister Imran Khan had taken notice of the incident and promised strict action against the suspects.
Initially, an FIR was registered under section 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 354A (assault or use of criminal force against woman and stripping her of her clothes), 506 (ii) (punishment for criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
Later, sections pertaining to rape, sexual abuse, extortion and wrongful confinement were also added to the FIR.
In September, charges were framed against Usman Mirza and co-accused Hafiz Attaur Rehman, Adaras Qayyum Butt, Rehan Hussain Mughal, Umar Bilal Marwat, Mohib Bangash and Farhan Shaheen.
After completing the trial proceeding, Additional District and Sessions Judge Ata Rabbani convicted Usman, Shaheen, Attaur Rehman, Butt and Mohib Khan and sentenced them to life imprisonment with a fine of Rs200,000 each.
The court, however, found no evidence against Mughal and Marwat and set them free.
The accused were brought to the courtroom handcuffed.
The victim couple during the cross-examination retracted from their statement recorded before the magistrate under section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) in which they had accused Usman and his accomplices of sexually abusing, filming and extorting money from them.
As per the 44-page verdict, the police, who were the complainant in the case, took the suspects into custody and after registration of the FIR the victims identified the suspects and recorded their statements before the magistrate against them.
Condoning the delay in registration of the FIR, the court stated that this was due to fear and stress and “this reason logically appeals to the common prudence because normally people do hesitate to provide the information promptly to police in such cases where honour and prestige is involved.”
During the trial proceeding, the victims appeared in the witness box in a dramatic manner and resiled from their statements and the court declared them ‘hostile witnesses’.
However, as per the court verdict, in a subsequent cross-examination by the prosecution and defence counsel, they brought certain information on the court record that was sufficient to connect the accused persons with the crime.
“It can safely be said that they have made their resiling statements either under pressure, under fear or coercion or by getting monetary benefits from the accused,” the verdict observed, adding that, “they failed to stand firm on their version despite the media and civil society provided moral support to them”.
“It is the duty of the court to consider all the facts in juxtaposition to reach a just decision and not to take into consideration the technicalities. The court cannot sit as mere spectator because the court is the guardian of the whole society. It is a crime against society as well and not against individuals only,” said the verdict.
It noted that the case of prosecution was based on modern devices and modern technology to substantiate the evidence.
Hence the verdict concluded, “the nutshell of above said discussion is that the prosecution has succeeded to prove its case against the accused beyond doubt.”
The verdict added, “The accused Rehan Hussain Mughal and Bilal Khan Marwat are hereby acquitted of the charges leveled against them.”

1,JUI-F issued notice for planning to set up stage on Srinagar Highway,"A contingent of 3,000 officials of Punjab police, 2,000 personnel of FC and 2,000 Rangers are arriving in the capital.","ISLAMABAD: The capital administration on Friday issued a show-cause notice to Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) for planning to set up stage on Srinagar Highway by blocking the road in violation of the terms and conditions of the no-objection certificate (NOC) issued to it. 
The notice was issued by Deputy Commissioner (DC) Hamza Shafqaat to JUI-F Islamabad emir Maulana Abdul Majeed Hazarvi, asking him to reply within 48 hours otherwise the NOC would be cancelled. 
It said according to the terms and conditions of the NOC, the rally planned by the JUI shall not disturb or disrupt fundamental rights of the citizens. 
The plan to block Srinagar Highway needs preemptive actions by the district administration to maintain law and order and to protect public rights, it said, adding that hence the organisers were being served show-cause notice, asking why the NOC issued for the public gathering may not be cancelled. 
“In consequence of non-compliance of the show-cause notice, the capital administration shall withdraw the NOC of the rally and you shall be responsible for any untoward incident,” the notice said. 
Meanwhile, PML-N Islamabad chapter president Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry approached the capital administration for issuance of an NOC for the party’s public gathering.
In a letter addressed to the DC, he shared details of the long march plan of the PML-N and the public gathering of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) in Islamabad. 
The PML-N’s long march will start on Saturday (today) from Lahore via G.T. Road and Islamabad Expressway and will reach Peshawar Mor, Srinagar Highway, in the evening.
The public gathering will be held at Peshawar Mor on March 28 and will be addressed jointly by the leadership of all PDM component parties. 
When contacted, Dr Chaudhry said a meeting was held with the officers of the police and capital administration. 
Asked why the PML-N also applied for the NOC as it had already been issued to the JUI-F, he said the NOC was not obtained in the name of the PDM. 
Meanwhile, the capital police have suggested to the administration to assign separate routes to the participants of the PTI and the PDM to reach the Parade Ground and H-9, sources in the police said.  
They said the suggestion was given after reports collected by the police showed that chances of physical confrontation between the PTI and opposition parties’ workers cannot be ruled out. 
Besides, a buffer zone should also be created between the two venues to ensure that there will be no standoff between them. 
In this regard, arrangements will be made at Zero Point, Islamabad Expressway from Zero Point to Faizabad, Ninth Avenue from Peshawar Mor to I.J. Principal Road and from Double Road to Faizabad on I.J. Principal Road to set up the buffer zone, the sources said.  
Peshawar Mor Underpass and Education Chowk at H-8 have been declared prohibited areas for the general public from March 26. 
A contingent of 3,000 officials of Punjab police, 2,000 personnel of FC, 2,000 Rangers, 200 policemen from Azad Kashmir and 400 personnel from Frontier Reserve Police are arriving in the capital. About 3,000 personnel will be deployed from Motorway Chowk to G-9. 
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed chaired a meeting to review arrangements for the public gatherings. Adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan, the interior secretary and officers of the police and administration of Islamabad and Rawalpindi attended the meeting. 
A control room has been established in the interior ministry, Mr Ahmed told the meeting, adding routine life should not be affected due to the public gatherings.

2,PTI hires DJ Butt once again,MNA says event will break all record of public meetings held anywhere in Pakistan.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has again hired DJ Butt to provide the sound system and play music during what the ruling party said the biggest ever public gathering in Islamabad on Sunday.
The famous Disc Jockey (DJ), who was briefly arrested during the 2014 sit-in of the PTI in the capital, later developed serious differences with the party as it delayed payments to him. Now the issues have been resolved.
“DJ Butt will be in action in our historic public gathering on Sunday,” said PTI regional president MNA Ali Nawaz Awan.
He said arrangements had almost been finalised for the public gathering which will be a referendum in favour of Prime Minister Imran Khan and his independent foreign policy.
Mr Awan, who is also the special assistant to the prime minister, said filling the massive area of Parade Ground spreading from I-8 to near Faizabad was not an easy task.
PTI Secretary General and Planning Minister Asad Umar, MNA Amer Mehmood Kiani, PTI leader Zahid Kazmi and others visited the Parade Ground.
Speaking to Dawn, PTI MNA Raja Khurram Nawaz said the event will break all record of public meetings held anywhere in Pakistan.
“We have mobilised people at the grassroots level and the response is amazing. People think that Imran Khan is being targeted by corrupt opposition members for his bold stance against Islamophobia, holding two meetings of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and his independent foreign policy and steps for improving life standards of the poor people of the country,” he said.
The call for the public gathering was given by the prime minister, who is facing a no-confidence motion moved by the joint opposition parties. The prime minister has stated that one million people will turn up in the meeting.
The PTI Islamabad chapter has already set up camps in various areas to mobilise the public for the public meeting. Banners have also been displayed in various areas of the city, particularly on Islamabad Expressway in favour of the prime minister.

9,First portion of Margalla Road likely to be completed by July,ISLAMABAD: Work on the first portion of Margalla Road from Sangjani to D-12 is in full swing as the civic agency is...,"ISLAMABAD: Work on the first portion of Margalla Road from Sangjani to D-12 is in full swing as the civic agency is expected to get it completed by July this year.
Officials of the engineering wing of the CDA said that out of total 10.5km-long-road, work on around 6km-long-road has been completed.
“Work is in progress with good pace and we are hopeful, that this project will be completed by July this year,” said an official of the CDA. 
The official said work on a railway bridge falling on the road was also in progress.
Originally the road starts from G.T. Road at Sangjani, but CDA, in a bid to avoid traffic, started work half kilometer short of G.T. Road and this small portion will now be constructed at the end of the project.
With regard to the Shah Allah Ditta graveyard, which falls in the alignment of the road, CDA is weighing three options, the official said, adding the civic agency will either go for flyover, a tunnel or divert portion of the road in this specific area.
An official of the CDA said the options were being discussed with special focus on flyover and tunnel.
It is expected that after completion of this road, the traffic load will be reduced from Srinagar Highway, as traffic coming from motorway, G.T. Road and residents of housing societies located along the G.T. Road will use this road.
Officials in CDA said construction of interchanges on Khayaban-i-Iqbal, which will be linked with road near D-12, are imperative to handle traffic coming from G.T. Road.
Therefore, they said, the engineering wing is planning to start construction of a couple of interchanges and a linking service road.
The Margalla Road from G.T. Road to Murree Road near Bhara Kahu is part of Islamabad’s master plan.
However, it remained neglected for decades and last year, on the direction of Prime Minister Imran Khan, CDA started this project. However, instead of construction of entire around 35km-long-road, the CDA is constructing it in pieces as under current plan, the civic agency will construct its two phases only.
Work on first phase from G.T. Road to D-12 is in progress while work on second phase, which is being called Bhara Kahu bypass, will likely start in May this year as its alignment and designing have already been finalised.
However, the third phase, which is main patch from D-12 to Quaid-i-Azam University, is not likely to begin in near future.
Sources said alignment and designing of Bhara Kahu bypass has been finalised and the work will likely be started by the end of April or in May, as PC-I of the project is yet be approved from CDA’s Development Working Party (DWP).
The 7.8km bypass road will start near Malpur area and after crossing through QAU and lower Shahdhra area it will be linked with Murree Road near Satra Meel area bypassing the Bhara Kahu bazaar.  
However, this project has been facing delay, though Prime Minister Imran Khan had laid foundation of this project in April last year.
