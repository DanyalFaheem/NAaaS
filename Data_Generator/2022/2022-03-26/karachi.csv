0,PTI begins journey to Islamabad on PM Imran’s call,"Party leaders vow to stay peaceful, respond to “every conspiracy against PM and Pakistan through their unity and support”.","KARACHI: A day after the caravan of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) left for Islamabad to attend the opposition’s March 28 rally, a large number of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) activists started their journey to the federal capital on Friday on the call given by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
They are scheduled to take part in a power show to be held on March 27 to support PM Khan ahead of the voting on the no-confidence move filed against him by the opposition.
PTI activists, including women, gathered before noon at Sohrab Goth, where party leaders made brief speeches to build a momentum for the long journey ahead. They called for unity in their ranks before the “final showdown” on March 27 in Islamabad.
A number of buses, cars and vans carrying PTI workers parked along the main Superhighway caused a little disruption in the movement of vehicular traffic for a while.
Those who led different groups of the caravan included Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh, PTI’s parliamentary party leader Khurram Sher Zaman, MNA Aftab Siddiqui, and MPAs Saeed Afridi and Shahnawaz Jadoon.
A little before 1pm, the caravan finally started moving towards its destination.
In their addresses to the workers joining in from all over Karachi, the PTI leaders vowed to stay peaceful and respond to “every conspiracy against the PM and Pakistan through their unity and support”.
The opposition leader said: “Thousands of people are now heading towards Islamabad on the call of PM Imran Khan and the whole world will see that Pakistan as a nation is standing by the side of the truth and right.”
“Heinous characters of politics have been exposed and the nation is united against such elements,” he said, adding that whatever had happened in Sindh House, Islamabad was a matter of shame and embarrassment to the province.” 
“We have started our journey as an advance party of the PTI’s Sindh caravan and we will welcome those following us to Islamabad,” he said.

The PPP lawmaker, who is in Dubai, through his attorney moved the SHC seeking remedy to appear before the trial court.
His lawyer expressed the apprehension that the MNA might be arrested upon his return and sought protection.
Without touching the merits of the case, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro granted protective bail against a solvent surety of Rs100,000 to the MNA directing him to surrender before the trial before or till April 3.
Young Nazim Jokhio was found murdered at the Malir farmhouse of PPP MPA Jam Awais in November last year. The MPA along with his MNA brother Jam Karim and others has been booked for allegedly torturing Nazim to death as he had tried to prevent his foreign guests from hunting houbara bustard.
Police have named the detained MPA and four others as accused in a charge sheet and shown the MNA as an absconding suspect in the case.
The protective bail will help the MNA to return to the country and take part in the voting on a no-confidence motion tabled by the joint opposition in the National Assembly against the prime minister.

2,Fate of over 800 medical students hangs in balance after SHC verdict,Sindh govt may seek one-year relief from PMC on MDCAT’s passing marks.,"KARACHI: The fate of over 800 students hangs in the balance after the Sindh High Court declared void the provincial government’s decision to reduce passing marks of the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test (MDCAT) conducted last year from 65 per cent to 50pc.
Sources told Dawn on Friday that the government was in a fix over the matter and might opt for filing an appeal against the decision before the apex court, or seeking a “relief” from the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) for a year on the minimum pass percentage set by the commission for MDCAT.
“If both options don’t work, affected students may go to court as now they can’t even switch to allied fields like pharmacy and physiotherapy, which are the first choice of students who fail to get admission to MBBS and BDS [programmes],” said a senior professor associated with the admission process.
He added that admission to pharmacy and physiotherapy had been closed two months back.

Sindh govt may seek one-year relief from PMC on MDCAT’s passing marks

The sources said 200 students got admission to MBBS whereas 650 to BDS in colleges in the province on the basis of less than 65pc marks that they obtained in the MDCAT. 
Most of the affected students were in private institutions. 
The tests had attracted protests and criticism from students and professional bodies across the country. 
The tussle between the provincial and federal governments over MDCAT was described as sad and disappointing.
‘Students interests ignored’
Reacting to the SHC decision, senior doctors said the matter should have been sorted out amicably, protecting the interests of students. 
“I am daily getting calls from concerned students and their parents, asking me what would happen now, and I don’t have any answer,” said Dr Syed Razi Muhammad, president of Pakistan Association of Private Medical and Dental Institutions-Sindh chapter.
“This episode reflected official indifference towards the country’s youth. This would never happen in a civilised country. Nobody thought about the future of these children,” he said.
Dr Qaiser Sajjad of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) said the issues raised by the association had remained unattended even after the court’s decision.
“Our concerns pertain to the lack of consultation on the establishment of PMC and the flawed mechanism adopted for carrying out medical and dental tests. Students’ had genuine reservations, which should have been timely addressed. One of them was the different syllabus taught in different provinces on the basis of which the test was prepared,” he said.
In India, Dr Sajjad pointed out, the government took four years of paperwork and consultation to shift from the Indian Dental and Medical Council to Indian Medical Commission. “There was no confrontation and no students’ loss because matters were sorted out with consultation. Unfortunately, this was not the case in Pakistan. The Sindh government had a genuine demand that they should have been consulted in the formation of the PMC.”
Sharing concerns of affected students, he said the PMC should have given a one-year relief and implemented the rule of 65pc minimum marks in MDCAT next year. 
“Also, students who had appeared in the MDCAT should have been provided with a carbon copy of their answer sheets for the purpose of transparency,” he said.
Weak legal ground
On SHC’s decision, sources said the judges’ remarks during the proceedings highlighted the weak legal ground adopted for the case by the provincial government The court in its detailed verdict ruled: “Quite strangely the Sindh government has only objected to fixing of benchmark (65%) to attain in the test to become eligible to admission and has otherwise expressly no issue to the whole mechanism employed for conducting the test, selecting procedure and syllabus for framing the questions, etc.
“This we find rather paradoxical and unsustainable, as on the one hand it has questioned legitimacy of the law as a whole on the ground of having residuary jurisdiction over the matter, and on the other hand has invoked the same law for selecting students for admission by reducing pass marks to 50%,” it added.
The PMC had challenged the Dec 2 decision of the Sindh cabinet of lowering the passing marks for MDCAT-2021 from 65pc to 50pc.
It also challenged four notifications, the decision of the admission committee and advertisements issued by the Jinnah Sindh Medical University (JSMU) and Shaheed Motarma Benazir Bhutto Medical University, Larkana, as well as other actions and steps taken in pursuant of the cabinet decision of lowering passing marks of MDCAT.
Prior to the decision, the tussle between the Sindh government and PMC over MDCAT had continued for months and both warned educational institutions to follow their policies or face consequences.

3,Arshad Pappu’s son held for killing ex-SHO,Investigators cite revenge as motive behind double murder,"KARACHI: A son of slain Lyari gangster Arshad Pappu was arrested for his alleged involvement in the March 22 targeted killing of a dismissed policeman and his friend to avenge his father’s murder. 
At a joint press conference at the Rangers headquarters, SSP-South Rai Ijaz Ahmed and Rangers Colonel Nasar Minullah said that the held suspect, Alam Baloch, was identified with the help of CCTV footage of the targeted attack on former SHO Chand Khan Niazi and Abdul Rehman.  
During initial probe, the Rangers official said, the suspect revealed that he had killed the duo to avenge the kidnapping and murder of his father Arshad Pappu.
He said that former SHO Niazi was allegedly involved in the kidnapping of Pappu and he was facing trial in the same murder case. He was targeted while returning from court on Raja Ghazanfar Ali Road in Saddar.

Investigators cite revenge as motive behind double murder

To various questions, SSP Ahmed said that the held suspect cited “revenge” as the basic motive for the targeted killing. “But we would be in a better position [to comment] after a proper investigation,” he added.
When asked about the December 2021 murder of another dismissed policeman, ex-SHO Javed Baloch, who was also facing trial in the Arshad Pappu murder case, the SSP said that suspect Baloch did not confess to his involvement in this case.
“A final opinion about this case may be given after the arrests of other suspects and their proper investigation,” he said.
He said the held suspect Baloch had no past criminal record. He was riding the motorbike and his pillion-rider fired shots.
Col Nasar said that the Rangers director general had established a  special team to look into the broad daylight killing of the dismissed  policeman and his friend.
He said that they had “no information that the gang warfare elements have become active again in Lyari”.
“Gang warfare suspects are not active in Lyari,” he said, adding that even the held suspect had cited ‘enmity’ as his motive for the double murder. 
The SSP said the police had provided ‘reasonable’ security at the antiterrorism courts and to accused on bail in the Arshad Pappu murder case.
About the cross-matching of the empty shell casings recovered from the crime scene, the SSP said that so far the investigators had not received the report of a forensic analysis.

The exhibition is a collection of photographs of Ms Mirza’s meanderings within Pakistan. Calling it a “labour of faith”, she has dedicated it to her grandchildren as well as all the children of Pakistan in the hope that they will always cherish and appreciate their beautiful motherland. 
The photographs were painstakingly put together into a collection by Ms Mirza’s daughters Tanya and Mishall. But the real stars of the show were her two grandchildren, 12-year-old Dahlia Ashraf and 10-year-old Emre Ashraf. Young Dahlia was the one who selected all the old photographs of her grandmother’s travels of over 30 years from her old albums. 
“The idea of holding this exhibition was to draw attention to Pakistan and for the children to value its diversity and beauty and to instil in them pride for Pakistan. I want them to gain inspiration from my travels. I want them to make pictures, I want to encourage research and learning about Pakistan,” she told Dawn. 
And to warming her heart right there were schoolchildren and other young visitors coming to see her photographs and appreciating them. Some children even sat down to draw and sketch the scenes from some photographs with the crayons and colour pencils provided to them along with drawing paper by the museum staff. 
“I’m thankful to Dr Asma Ibrahim, the director of the SBP Museum, for facilitating me. She has herself set up this museum with great devotion, dedication and passion,” said Ms Mirza. 
The young visitors were taken around the exhibition by Ms Mirza, who filled them in about each photograph that interested them or which they would point to. There was a story or anecdote associated with each photograph. She had something to tell them about the tandoor walla of Abbottabad, the camel walla of Sukkur, the pakora seller of Manora, etc. The photographs of her at different religious places or at the forts had more stories and qissas accompanying them, not to forget the historical significance of all these places.

7,SHC upholds life term for policeman who killed two young men,Court rules offence did not fall within ATA purview,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has upheld life imprisonment handed down to a policeman by an antiterrorism court in a case pertaining to the murder of two youngsters.
However, the two-judge antiterrorism appellate bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha observed that the case did not fall within the ambit of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, since the intent of policeman was to stop the youths for checking, but they tried to ride away.
An ATC had convicted Constable Madad Khan for life in prison in February 2019 for killing motorcyclists Mohammad Ali and Mohammad Danish on Tipu Sultan Road in Bahadurabad in May 2015, as they allegedly attempted to speed away when a police party signalled them to stop.
The trial court had acquitted four other members of the police party for lack of evidence.

Court rules offence did not fall within ATA purview 

The convict, through his lawyer, filed an appeal against his conviction before the SHC, which after hearing both sides and examining record and proceedings of the case upheld the conviction handed under Section 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code, but removed the offences of ATA.
However, the bench in its order noted that the state and complainant party neither filed an appeal against the acquittal of the co-accused, who were alleged to be with the convict at the time of the incident, nor submitted any application for enhancement of the appellant’s sentence.
It further said that after considering the judicial confession of the appellant and the evidence on record, the bench found that the confession was made voluntarily and all the procedural safeguards were carried out by the magistrate while recording confessional statement, and the statements of prosecution witnesses corroborated the case of prosecution.
The ballistic report of the official sub-machine gun (SMG) issued to the appellant was also positive as he fired four bullets and the medical report also supported the prosecution story since one victim sustained two bullet wounds and other received one bullet injury, it added.
The verdict stated that the prosecution proved its case against the appellant while the case of co-accused was on a different footing as they did not make any confession, and all the rounds of their SMGs were also returned, and in his confession the appellant said they were only present with him and did not fire.
The bench said that the case did not fall within the purview of the ATA as decided by a larger bench of the Supreme Court in the case of Ghulam Hussain verses state as for an act of terrorism there had to be an intent, object and design to create terror on account of that act.
“Based on the particular facts and circumstances of this case it appears that the intent of the appellant was to stop the deceased who refused to obey his signal to stop their motorbike for checking and instead rode on and as such he became furious and fired upon them with intention to kill for disobeying his order to stop but not with design, intent or purpose to create terror as such all offences under the ATA are dismissed especially as it was a night time incident when no member of the public was even around to be terrorized,” it added.
According to the prosecution, Ali and Danish along with other friends were going to Dhoraji for tea and at around 2.15am. A police party of the Bahadurabad police station signalled them to stop at the traffic signal on Tipu Sultan Road, but they allegedly sped away and the police opened fire on them suspecting them as criminals who were fleeing after looting people.

8,Annual conference on development gets under way at IBA,KARACHI: The 2nd annual international conference — ‘Development: Discourses and Critiques’ — organised by ...,"KARACHI: The 2nd annual international conference — ‘Development: Discourses and Critiques’ — organised by the School of Economics and Social Sciences (SESS) in collaboration with the Centre for Business and Economic Research (CBER) began at the main campus of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) on Friday. 
The three-day event would conclude on Sunday (tomorrow). 
This year’s theme invites works from a wide range of disciplines to critique, question and reconsider the experiences of transnational, national and sub-national actors with the development process. 
What does ‘development’ mean for different actors, and how has this narrative shifted over time? How does development define and redefine power relations, what implications does this have for numerous groups? How have colonial experiences shaped futures and how does one deconstruct the idea rooted in these experiences? 
To encourage innovation and diversity within modes of thinking, the conference hosted presenters and participants from diverse backgrounds, including Skardu, Sukkur, Gilgit, Quetta, and Islamabad, and multiple professors from universities of the United States. 
The conference aims to centre critical perspectives that help gain a subtle understanding of social change and development. 
Dr Mushfiq Mobarak, a professor at Yale University, spoke on ‘seasonal poverty and seasonal migration’. He recognised the forms of poverty that emerged during seasonal changes and highlighted its implications, specifically in the form of seasonal hunger. 
The first panel discussion of Day 1 was titled ‘Institutions, Governance and Inequalities’. The session highlighted various statistics on the economic and social inequalities in Pakistan, and also included the indigenous communities within the policy-making process and judicial independence in Pakistan. 
In the session titled ‘Agrarian Crisis and South Asian Political Economy’, Dr Barbara Harriss-White, Emeritus Professor of Development Studies and a fellow of Wolfson College, University of Oxford, shared her close insights and research on the South Asian political economy, particularly on food, energy, and aspects of deprivation.

11,Court orders Zardari-Bhand land dispute case transferred,Five Bhands and a policeman were gunned down in Qazi Ahmed on Feb 12,"HYDERABAD: A division bench of Sindh High Court’s Hyderabad circuit has ordered transfer of investigation relating to a land dispute between the Bhand community and Zardari clansmen of Shaheed Benazirabad district to a competent officer. 
An armed attack allegedly carried out by Zardari clansmen on Feb 12 had left five members of the Bhand community and a policeman dead. The Bhand community immediately held a sit-in and ended it on a fourth day, when many political and nationalist leaders brokered a temporary settlement between the two sides. 
The bench comprising Justice Salahuddin Panhwar and Justice Zulfiqar Ahmed Khan passed the case transfer order on Thursday on multiple petitions, filed in 2013 and 2021 on the same issue. The petitioners were represented by Mir Ahmed Mangrio, Ahsan Gul Dahri, Khalid Saeed Soomro and Sundar Das advocates. 
The bench noted in its order that due to the dispute, police officials had registered false cases against the petitioners as private respondents were influential and backed by government; hence in the interest of justice investigation of the cases should be transferred to some competent officer. 

Five Bhands and a policeman were gunned down in Qazi Ahmed on Feb 12

Additional Advocate General Mohammad Ismail Bhutto raised no objection on transfer of the investigation. The court directed the Sindh police chief to transfer the investigations of FIR No. 28/13 registered at the B-section police station of Shaheed Benazirabad and FIR Nos. 2/13, 3/22 and 4/22 registered at the Mirzapur police station to DSP Siraj Lashari. 
The bench directed the DSP to conduct an impartial inquiry preferably within one month and submit a report in the competent court as well as this court. It asked the SSP concerned to provide all logistic support to the IO.  
With regard to arrest of absconding accused in the FIR Nos. 3 and 4 of 2022 registered at the Mirzapur police station, the SSP was told to ensure their arrest within the spirit of the reported “Nasrullah case” and adopt coercive measures, including blockage of their computerised national identity cards (CNICs), bank accounts, attachment of properties and other modes. In case of failure, he would face legal ramifications, the bench said. 
Besides, the court directed the Hyderabad DIG to provide protection to the complainant party in above-mentioned FIRs by deputing a team comprising competent officers, who must personally visit the site/houses of complainant party and ensure that no bodily harm was caused to them in any manner. 
The AAG contended that these petitions had been pending since 2013 and 2021 whereas petitioners were seeking an inquiry of the FIRs registered in 2022. The court deferred his objection, observing that since the dispute was between the same parties and the earlier FIRs were lodged by rival parties, hence subsequent events could be considered by court.  
The court fixed the matter for hearing after one month. 
The latest petition was filed last year by Mohammad Zaman, Mehdi Hassan, Ali Hassan, Bahadur Khan, Abdul Razzaq and Qurban -- all Bhands. They stated in their petition that they had been living in the Ismail Bhand village of taluka Qazi Ahmed since their forefathers and had pieces of land on lease since 1973. They said some villagers were granted 10-year lease of the land. 
They said that some private persons having connections with the ruling party in Sindh were bent upon throwing petitioners out of their own lands and usurp the same under directives from the Zardari House, Nawabshah, for political vendetta. They said that the respondent officials were following the directives and no one could raise voice against their illegal acts. 
They said the influential personalities were keeping an evil eye over petitioners’ lands and at their instance private persons in collusion with local police were not allowing petitioners to visit or cultivate their lands or harvest standing crops. They said police had set up pickets on their (petitioners) lands and not allowing them to cultivate their own lands.  
“No authority is ready to hear us … we were running from pillar to post,” the petitioners said. 
They said that prior to this, political personalities through “the same Qabza mafia” were not allowing petitioners and their relatives to approach their lands and cultivate them. So, they said, some villagers had filed CP 352/2013 and some other villagers filed another CP 482/2013 against private persons and police. 
They said court had ordered an inquiry through its April 11, 2013 order to be conducted by Inspector Sirajuddin Lashari, and he had filed a report on his findings. 
They prayed the court to direct the respondents to remove police force/pickets from the petitioners’ lands so that they could cultivate them. They sought appointment of a judicial officer to visit these lands. They also urged recovery of two detained persons, Sumair and Mir Mohammad.

The youth, Bhag Chand, 27, was found dead in the lock up and as soon as the police informed his family about his death, his relatives and many villagers held a protest sit-in outside accusing the SHO and some of his subordinates of having killed him. They claimed that Bhag Chand was arrested many days ago in a theft case at the behest of the PPP district women wing leader, Samtra Manjani. She, however, rejected the allegation. 
While the protest was in progress, Judicial Magistrate Nisar Ahmed visited the police station and heard the aggrieved side. He also spoke to the SHO, Mohammad Soomar Mangrio, and his personnel to ascertain facts. Finally, he asked the police to record the bereaved family’s statement and register an FIR if cognizable offence was made out. 
The complaint was lodged by Bhag Chand’s uncle, Jay Ram Meghwar. 
The heirs alleged that police had been subjecting Bhag Chand to torture ever since his detention. They said he was detained many days ago but the police showed his arrest only on Thursday, when his condition deteriorated due to intense torture. 
The victim’s body was taken to the Mithi Civil Hospital but a post-mortem examination was yet to be performed. Some people who examined the body claimed there were marks of torture visible on different parts of the body. 
Special Assistant to the CM on Human Rights Surendar Valasai in a press statement strongly condemned the incident and sought a detailed report from the police officials concerned. In her statement, Samtra Manjiani refuted the allegation that Bhag Chand was arrested or tortured at her behest. 
Other PPP leaders, including Engineer Gianchand Tharani, Sushil Malani, Nandlal Malhi and others visited the police station and assured the protesters of their full cooperation in ensuring a fair investigation into the incident and justice to the bereaved family.  
Bhag Chand’s relatives said they would continue their protest until arrest of all nominated suspects, including the SHO and Ms Manjiani.
The sit-in, which started in morning, was continuing till late in the evening.

14,‘Tharis are forced to consume toxic water’,Miseries caused by mining activity at Thar Coal project highlighted at webinar,"KARACHI: Woes of Thari people continue even today as they are forced to consume subsoil water contaminated with toxic waste being discharged from coal mines, pointed out speakers at a webinar held on Friday.
Titled ‘Coal-induced water woes of Tharis’ was organised by the Alliance for Climate Justice & Clean Energy (ACJCE), a coalition of think tanks and civil society organisations working on energy transition in the country. 
Giving an insight into the problems being created by coal mining companies in Thar, Azhar Lashari from the Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development said mining activity in Thar was poisoning the precarious groundwater resources of the region and making lives of locals miserable. 
“Percolation of toxic water from Gorano and Dukar Chaou reservoirs, lowering of water table around mining sites and dumping of wastewater in farmlands have been posing a serious threat to the ecosystem and public health,” he shared, adding that while water level of the dug up wells was depleting in some villages, sweet water of these wells surrounding the wastewater reservoirs was getting toxic. 
“Cases of malarial fever and livestock casualties have significantly increased in the area” he noted.

Miseries caused by mining activity at Thar Coal project highlighted at webinar

Muhammad Abdul Rafay from the Alternative Law Collective said testimonies of Tharis revealed serious violations of environmental laws being committed by coal mining and power generation companies. 
“The release of contaminated water into agricultural and grazing lands by these companies and its reinjection into underground aquifers violate the Sindh Environment Protection Act, the National Water Policy 2018 and their generation licences issued by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority,” he explained. 
Mr Rafay added the judiciary had repeatedly held such practices a violation of the constitutional right to life and a breach of public trust. 
Two representatives of the Thar community also highlighted water-related difficulties they had been facing in the region. Rani Bheel, a resident of Bitra village, Block-II, complained that coal companies were releasing poisonous water openly with no regard to human life. 
“This is also harming our livestock. More than 50 buffaloes and cows, 70 plus camels and over 500 goats and sheep have died after drinking the poisonous water,” she said. 
Ms Bheel further said that clean water wells were becoming saline and toxic, aggravating troubles of local women who now had to fetch potable water from far-flung areas. 
Sharing the harmful impact of dams built by companies in the area, Ameer Hassan, an office-bearer of the Thar Samaji Tehreek, said 20 dug-wells had become saline after Gorano dam was developed. 
The local community representatives shared that more than 50 children living in the villages located close to the dam had died over the last few years, adding that mosquito-borne diseases “had spread in the area due to toxic water”.
A short documentary was also screened at the webinar, highlighting the magnitude of water-related issues in Thar.

Sindh Commission on Status of Women chairperson Nuzhat Shireen told the audience that ground realities should be considered first in the matter. 
In many cases, she said, probe committees were changed even during the course of investigations into various cases. She said laws were enacted in haste and when they were not implemented.
Others who also spoke on the occasion were Rozan’s district coordinator Rubina Chandio, Prof Ismail Kumbhar and Zubeda Thahim, in-charge of Darul Aman.
