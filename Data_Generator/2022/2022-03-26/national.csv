0,CJP reminds bar of his prerogative to form benches,Chief Justice Bandial cautions against pointing finger at judges,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial on Friday said the composition of benches and fixing cases before them was his prerogative. 
Referring to the concerns expressed by Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) vice chairman Hafeezur Rehman Chaudhry and Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Mohammad Ahsan Bhoon during a full court reference to bid farewell to the outgoing judge, Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed, CJP Bandial wondered which practice or judicial precedence they were talking about. 
During the full court reference, Ahsan Bhoon had referred to a letter written by Justice Qazi Faez Isa, in which it was highlighted that the practice of consulting senior-most judges on important cases had been discarded when there was a discernable criterion in the constitution of benches. 

Chief Justice Bandial cautions against pointing finger at judges 

“This is most troubling and gives rise to unnecessary and avoidable misgivings; all the more in cases in which the eyes of the entire nation are set,” the letter regretted. 
In response, the chief justice asked the two bar leaders to show how the benches had been formed during the last 15 to 20 years and said it was a clear prerogative of the CJP.  
“Don’t make sweeping statements by saying that the judges were paid servants,” Chief Justice Bandial said, adding that with utmost respect and civility in his command, such comments in speeches were unfair and inappropriate.  
While cautioning against pointing finger at judges, the CJP observed that not only the Supreme Court but the high courts comprised committed and high calibre judges.  
He also cited a recent editorial written in Dawn, which discussed the traits of the judges like competence in the field of law, capacity to work endlessly, sweetness in the temperament by listening with patience to all and independence from the fear of any force or temptation or any kind of attraction.  
“Please raise your hand if you do not agree with it,” the CJP said, emphasising: “We do not have any choice amongst any lawyer and have to decide the cases in accordance with the law and Constitution as well as the truth and record before us. We are responsible to Allah Almighty since a very important duty has been caste upon us.”  
The chief justice said it would not matter whether the attorney general for Pakistan was standing “before us or Ahsan Bhoon”.  
Justice Bandial also had a word of advice for the bar, saying that they should come prepared for their cases, summarise their arguments and cite proper law and record. 
The bar is now cooperating since no adjournments were being given and disposal of cases was taking place and it was evident from the fact that the court decided 4,000 cases in the last two months.  
The chief justice said one should realise for how long judges sat in their chambers and did their judicial work.  
“Despite important cases like the presidential reference, regular stream of cases is not being disrupted,” he added. 
He also defended the Supreme Court registrar, Jawwad Paul, and said he was among the best with 20 years of experience and required qualification.  
“The registrar knows how to carry out administrative work and that he was the choice of the CJP, he said.  
“Do you expect the CJP to also do his job,” Justice Bandial asked, adding that it was his domain to decide which case should be fixed before which bench. 
The bars are trustees as they are representatives of the lawyers, Justice Bandial said, adding that the bar diminished its stature by hurling allegations on speculations and hearsay. “I am just an ‘Ameen’ for a few days and will be gone one day,” the chief justice said, adding that it was hurtful when such allegations are made.

1,"Imran’s ‘trump card’ claim a hollow threat, says Maryam","Castigates the premier for ""threats"" to his own party members.","LAHORE: Rejecting Imran Khan’s claim of having a ‘trump card’ to defeat the opposition’s move to oust him from office, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz  offered a word of advice to the prime minister on Firday, asking him to show some ‘self-respect’ and resign instead of seeking time to stay in government.   
Addressing party workers at the PML-N’s secretariat in Model Town, she said: “Today, Imran Khan is crying for help not from the public but someone else pleading to come forward and help save his government. But let me tell him… no one will come to his rescue now. He is seeking NRO from everyone…going to his party men and allies whom he never bothered to talk to.”  
Asking the PM to stop bluffing people on holding a trump card, she said: “Imran is left with no cards, rather his government’s days are numbered and this is writing on the wall.” 
She also castigated Mr Khan for ‘threats’ to his own party members. “Imran is in power, yet over two dozen MNAs have left him. On the other hand, Nawaz Sharif is in opposition but not a single lawmaker parted ways with him despite worst political victimisation by the PTI regime during the past three-and-a-half years,” she claimed.  
The PML-N leader said people would not come out in favour of the “selected” premier but would take to the streets against him under the banner of the opposition. She asked the party workers to get ready for the long march towards Islamabad to be kicked off on Saturday (today) from Model Town.
In her speech, Ms Nawaz hurled serious allegations against certain figures close to the prime minister. However, she did not offer anything to substantiate those allegations.
Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Hamza Shehbaz also advised Imran Khan to resign if any grace was left in him.

2,PTI expedites efforts to win back allies,Qureshi claims MQM assured govt of support; Bilawal meets BAP leaders.,"ISLAMABAD: While on one hand Prime Minister Imran Khan continued meeting Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) MNAs to seek their renewed support for the opposition’s no-trust resolution against him, his party on the other hand intensified its efforts to woo its allies in the government.
Those who called on the prime minister at the PM House on Friday were federal Minister for National  Food Security Fakhar Imam, PM’s special assistant Ghulam Arbab Rahim and MNA Ghazala Saifi. 
“The PTI leaders expressed confidence in the leadership of Imran Khan and recalled his achievements such as social welfare projects, upward economic trends, a sagacious foreign policy, the holding of Organisation of Islamic Cooperation foreign ministers’ conference and raising the issue of Islamophobia on the international level,” an official press release stated. 
The food security minister apprised the premier of the expected bumper crop of wheat. 

Qureshi claims MQM assured govt of support; Bilawal meets BAP leaders

On the other hand, the ruling PTI intensified its efforts to woo its allies to seek their support for the no-confidence motion in the National Assembly.
Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi got in touch with the leadership of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q). After his meeting with the MQM, Mr Qureshi countered the claims of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) that an understanding had been reached between the opposition party and the MQM.
He claimed that a PTI delegation had met MQM leaders wherein the allies denied they had reached any agreement with the PPP. He further claimed that the meeting remained successful as the MQM assured the government of its support in the lower house. 
The foreign minister also telephoned PML-Q senior leader and Punjab Assembly Speaker Parvez Elahi, and informed him that a ruling party delegation would meet the Q-League leaders in Lahore on Saturday (today).
Meanwhile, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry claimed that the opposition was upset after seeing a “huge” public meeting addressed by the PM in Mansehra on Friday. 
He said arrangements for the “historic” PTI gathering in the federal capital on Sunday were in their final stage. As the government stepped up its efforts to placate its coalition partners, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also met PTI-allied Balochistan Awami Party leaders in Parliament Lodges.

3,CERN team reviewing Pakistan’s associate membership,ISLAMABAD: A task force of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is reviewing to extend the ...,"ISLAMABAD: A task force of the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is reviewing to extend the associate membership of Pakistan for another five years, a press release of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) said on Friday. 
The task force comprising five experts is holding meetings with different entities in Pakistan to review the associate membership.
Pakistan’s five-year associate membership completed in July 2020. The CERN council designated a task force and decided to carry out a virtual review of the country’s membership from March 7 to 18 this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. 
However, one of the meetings was postponed due to the extraordinary call session of the CERN council on Russian-Ukraine conflict, the PAEC said. The postponed session will now be held on April 19. 
Virtual meetings of CERN task force members with Pakistani delegates were held at length at PAEC headquarters. PAEC Chairman Muhammad Naeem welcomed all CERN task force members for virtual meetings with different entities in Pakistan and elaborated millstones of the collaboration.
Pakistan became a CERN associate member on July 31, 2015 and is contributing to its projects, including detector technology, heavy mechanical parts fabrication and providing technical support. 
The PAEC is the lead agency for the Pak-CERN collaboration. Other institutes participating from Pakistan include NCP, COMSATS, PINSTECH and other universities.
CERN, one of the world’s largest and most respected centres for scientific research, was established by 20 European countries in Geneva on the principle of “science for peace”. 
It has now evolved as the world’s largest particle physics laboratory with 23 members, 10 associate members and six observers. 
CERN’s aim is to unravel the frontiers of knowledge and the secrets after the Big Bang, develop new technologies for accelerators and detectors, train scientists and engineers for future, and and unite people from different countries and cultures.
On March 18, CERN task force members also had a virtual meeting with Minister for Science and Technology Syed Shibli Faraz.
Mr Faraz appreciated the long-standing collaboration of Pakistan with CERN and particularly the increased cooperation after Pakistan attained the status of an associate member.
Pakistan has attained numerous benefits from the membership, such as increased number of engineering contracts to support CERN programmes, which are beneficial for the country’s industrial sector, human resources development and sharing of techniques and technology in key areas, besides numerous intellectual benefits.

4,FO rejects India’s remarks on outcome of OIC session,"Spokesperson says Indian MEA statement ""reflects the frustration of a country that stands exposed and isolated"".","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday rejected as ‘totally untenable’ and ‘irresponsible’ statement by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on the outcome of unanimously adopted resolutions at the recently held session of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation’s Council of Foreign Ministers (OIC-CFM). 
The OIC-CFM in its Islamabad session supported Pakistan’s call for a joint probe to establish the facts surrounding the recent firing of a missile into Pakistan’s territory from India. The OIC in a resolution also urged India to “work constructively with Pakistan for enhancing regional security and stability through the settlement of outstanding disputes and positively responding to Pakistan’s proposal for a Strategic Restraint Regime, including measures for arms control, restraint and confidence building”. 
The FO spokesman, in a statement, noted the OIC was a collective voice of the Muslim Ummah and the second largest international organisation after the United Nations, with 57 members and six observer states. “The OIC has a longstanding principled position in support of the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for their right to self-determination granted to them by the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council. While refusing to implement the UNSC resolutions, India has for decades tried to suppress the voice of the Kashmiris through brutal and indiscriminate use of force and gross and systematic violations of human rights in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK),” the statement added. 
Besides, the FO pointed out, the ascendant BJP-RSS-inspired “Hindutva” ideology restricted the space for religious minorities in India, especially Muslims whose persecution under state patronage has become a norm in today’s India. “The OIC has accordingly condemned massive human rights abuses in IIOJK, and has once again firmly rejected India’s illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019 and subsequent steps aimed at altering the demographic composition of the occupied territory,” the FO spokesman explained. 
He said the OIC had denounced the blatant and widespread discrimination, intolerance and violence against Muslims in India, and called upon India to ensure their rights, including religious freedom. 
However, reacting to the OIC resolutions and statements, the Indian MEA said the references made to India were based on ‘falsehoods and misrepresentation’. “The statements and resolutions adopted at the meeting demonstrate both the irrelevance of the OIC as a body and role of Pakistan as its manipulator,” MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said. 
According to The Times of India on Thursday, he also warned all the nations and governments that associated themselves with such exercises to realise the impact it had on their “reputation”. 
Commenting on the India’s reaction, the FO spokesman said: “Devoid of any logic or substance, the MEA statement reflects the frustration of a country that stands exposed and isolated. Instead of denying the historical facts and realities, attempting to mislead the international community through fictional claims over the disputed territory, and dismissing valid concerns as reflected in the OIC resolutions, India would be well-advised to pay heed, review its current behaviour, and act responsibly to urgently address those concerns.”

5,"EAA, ADB plan to educate 960,000 poor children in Pakistan",ISLAMABAD: Global education foundation Education Above All (EAA) has partnered with the Asian Development Bank to...,"ISLAMABAD: Global education foundation Education Above All (EAA) has partnered with the Asian Development Bank to enroll 960,000 out-of-school children in the country into primary education over the next four years. 
The EAA project, with financial contributions from Qatar Fund for Development and implementation by the ADB, is testament to the foundation’s commitment to educate every child through strategic partnerships. 
The EAA’s track record shows that the most effective way to eliminate barriers to education is to work cooperatively across sectors, the foundation said in a press release issued on Friday. 
The EAA is a global foundation established in 2012 by Sheikha Moza bint Nasser of Qatar. 
The new partnership is part of a concerted effort to bring the country’s most marginalised children into primary level education and comes off the back of EAA’s already remarkable track record of enrolling over 10.7 million children into education across the world. 
Pakistan is facing serious education challenges, with one-third of five- to 16-year-olds (or 22.8 million children) out of school. Gender inequality, mountainous geography and poverty are counted as the country’s most significant barriers to education. 
The EAA-ADB project will work within Pakistan’s existing integrated social protection programme, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), which seeks to strengthen and expand the Pakistan social protection system by facilitating access to health services, nutrition, and social protection. 
Through BISP, the joint EAA-ADB project targets the “hardest to reach” children in the country’s most marginalised families. It facilitates Pakistan’s ability to provide conditional financial support to marginalised mothers of out-of-school children who enroll their children in primary education.
The project also aims to bolster school attendance for girls through additional cash incentives for their enrolment.

The temple — located in the Kund Malir area of Lasbela — is considered one of the largest pilgrimage sites in Hindu civilisation. The celebrations of the festival could not be held during the past two years due to Covid-19.
The Balochistan government has deployed hundreds of police, Levies and Frontier Corps personnel to provide security to the pilgrims.
More than 800 security personnel were providing security in and around the temple. Security personnel have also been deployed on the route linking the temple.
The festival has great importance for the Hindu community. Former Indian finance minister Jaswant Singh and many other Indian leaders attended the festival in the past.
Senator Danesh Kumar said in a message that it was a great occasion for the Hindu community of not only Pakistan but also of other countries, including India.
Every year, thousands of Hindu pilgrims come to Hinglaj to attend this festival, he said.
Mr Kumar said that the government had made arrangements for providing better facilities to the pilgrims.

A defence lawyer told the court that Mr Sharif was busy in Islamabad due to the National Assembly session on a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan. He also filed a written application for a one-time exemption from personal appearance on behalf of his client.  
FIA prosecutor Sikandar Zulqarnain opposed the application, saying the suspects did not respect the courts. He asked whether proceedings of the court were important or those of the assembly. He said the suspects had been trying to delay the indictment on one pretext or the other.  
The defence counsel said it was a known fact that the NA session had been summoned to take up the no-trust motion against the prime minister. He said Shehbaz Sharif, being the leader of the opposition, was constitutionally bound to attend the session. 
Presiding Judge Ijaz Hassan Awan allowed the application and extended until April 4 the pre-arrest bail of Mr Sharif and his son Hamza, who was present in the court. 
The judge directed the counsel of a co-suspect, Mohammad Usman, to conclude his arguments on the point of the court’s jurisdiction by the next hearing. 
In this case, the judge had turned down a written request by the FIA to hold the trial proceedings on a daily basis.

8,South Punjab bill may be on  NA’s agenda for Monday,"Under the draft bill, the south Punjab province would have 56 seats in the National Assembly.","ISLAMABAD: A government-sponsored bill seeking the creation of the south Punjab province is set to be listed on the National Assembly’s agenda for Monday, when the house meets next to take up the crucial no-trust motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan.
Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi submitted a constitutional amendment bill to National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Friday, seeking to split Punjab into two provinces — with Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan divisions constituting the new south.
At Mr Qureshi’s request, the speaker issued orders to put the bill on Monday’s agenda. Deputy Speaker Qasim Soori was present on the occasion.
The move comes as the PTI struggles to win back support of dissidents within the party, many of whom happen to be from south Punjab.
Under the draft bill, the south Punjab province would have 56 seats in the National Assembly, including 46 general seats, and 119 in its provincial assembly.
Creating south Punjab as the country’s fifth province was one of PTI’s election manifestos.
“Today, we have fulfilled another promise made to the people of south Punjab,” Mr Qureshi later told reporters outside Parliament House, adding that he had moved the bill on the prime minister’s directive. He urged opposition parties, including the PPP and PML-N, to support the constitutional amendment bill.
The minister said this was a longstanding demand of the people of south Punjab and the passage of the bill would further strengthen the federation.
He stressed that the PTI was the first government that had made serious efforts for creating the south Punjab province. It was the first time in the country’s history that a separate annual development package was rolled out for southern Punjab areas, he added.
Mr Qureshi said Prime Minister Imran Khan earlier announced at a public meeting in Mailsi that the constitutional amendment bill would be tabled in the parliament.
About the no-confidence motion against the premier, Mr Qureshi said the opposition was set for a defeat. “We will face their motion in a democratic, constitutional and political way,” he said.
A bill seeking the creation of south Punjab province landed in the Senate in January. The private member bill was introduced in the house by Rana Mehmoodul Hasan of the PML-N and was supported by both PTI and PPP.
“It is a wail of our deprivations,” Mr Hassan said at the time while presenting the case for south Punjab province before the upper house of parliament.
He said people living in southern parts of Punjab had been facing multiple hardships and had to travel long distances only to fetch drinking water. He also reminded the PTI of its promise to make south Punjab a separate province within 100 days in power.
Leader of the Opposition in Senate and former premier Yousaf Raza Gilani said the issue was so important that the PPP during its rule had already managed to get a bill for the creation of Bahawalpur province passed from the Senate.
However, he reminded other parties that PPP was demanding a separate province and not just a secretariat for the people of south Punjab. “We are demanding a province, not a secretariat. It is not a colonial system where limited democracy will work,” the PPP senator asserted.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan on the occasion had said PM Imran Khan was in principle in favour of the new province but there were ‘certain problems’ that needed to be discussed and resolved.
He then requested the chair to refer the bill to the committee concerned for further deliberations and to achieve political consensus.

A China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 with 132 people on board crashed in mountains in southern China on Monday after a sudden plunge from cruising altitude at about the time when it would normally start to descend ahead of its landing.
Flight MU5735 was en route from the southwestern city of Kunming, capital of Yunnan province, to Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong, bordering Hong Kong, when it crashed.
After the incident, PIA CEO Arshad Malik wrote a letter to the Chinese airline chairman to express his sympathies for the victims.
In response to the letter, the chairman of China Eastern Airlines said: “All of us are in deepest shock and sadness for what has happened. China Eastern Airlines has activated the first-level emergency mechanism, sent a working group to the scene, and opened a special line for emergency assistance for family members of those onboard the flight.”
He said that they would properly handle the aftermath, provide comfort and services for the families of the victims, release information in a timely and accurate manner, seriously identify the cause of the accident with parties concerned and ensure the safety of air travel.
