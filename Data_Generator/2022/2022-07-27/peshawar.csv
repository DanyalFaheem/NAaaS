Winding up discussion on an adjournment motion regarding abuse and murder of three minor girls in Peshawar during the last couple of weeks, labour minister Shaukat Yousafzai told the house that a comprehensive law was in place to deal with violence against children but it needed immediate yet strict implementation.
He said awareness among parents was also required to guide children about sexual abuse.
“The government should direct the police not to allow children to venture outside their homes during late hours. The government should ban the movement of children outside homes without their parents after 8pm,” he said.

During PA session, minister says minors should be ‘banned’ from stepping out alone after 8pm

The minister said work on the Peshawar Safe City Project was in progress with the pilot project already launched in Hayatabad Township.
He said the project would be extended to the entire city as funds for it were available.
He said investigation into the murder of a Peshawar girl after rape was in progress and the police would arrest culprits ‘soon’.
The opposition members expressed dismay over the incidents of sexual abuse and murder of children and demanded rigorous punishment for culprits.
PPP member Nighat Yasmin Orakzai, who moved the motion, insisted that the government should complete the Peshawar Safe City Project as soon as possible.
She said unfortunately, the province didn’t have a forensic lab, so the cases were referred to a Lahore lab for investigation.
She demanded the formulation of a committee comprising treasury and opposition on the matter.
JUI-F member Hafiz Hisammuddin said late marriage and drug use among youth were major causes of violence against children.
He said under Sharia, the people should marry off their children soon after they attained puberty.
Dr Sumaira Shams of the PTI said the bill to protect children rights was passed with proposed amendments and it was duty of the bureaucracy to take steps for its implementation.
She said the committees of the Women Commission should be constituted for the implementation of laws relating to the protection of women and children’s rights.
Inayatullah Khan of the MMA suggested that steps be taken to control violence among youth due to online games.
He also said ‘obscenity had increased in society due to the misuse of mobile phones’.

Ikhtiar Wali of the PML-N demanded public hanging of those involved in the rape and murder of children. He asked the government to empower the police to deal with miscreants.
The assembly approved the KP Safe Blood Transfusion Project (Phase-II) Employees (Regularisation of Services) Bill, 2022, and KP Apprenticeship Bill, 2022, and deferred one bill due to the absence of the education minister.
During question hour, the house was informed that Wapda had to pay Khyber Pakhtunkhwa a total of Rs918 billion on account of net hydel profit and the province did not get the amount during the last five years.
A written reply to a question of MPA Inayatullah said that the provincial government took up the matter in the meetings of Council of Common Interest (CCI) and a committee was formed on Dec 23, 2019, to determine the amount of dues.
The committee held three meetings and would submit its report to the CCI after finalising it in light of recommendations of its members.
Earlier, MPA Inayatullah wondered what measures the PTI government had taken to claim electricity arrears.
Responding to the supplementary questions, law minister Fazl Shakoor said under the AGN Qazi formula, profit was being paid at the rate of Rs8.9 per unit.
He said a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2016 between the centre and the province for the payment of net hydel profit at the rate of Rs1.1 per unit rate, while Rs20 billion had been paid annually since then.
Responding to a calling attention notice, minister for higher education Kamran Bangash told the assembly that the department of anti-corruption and the provincial inspection team were looking into a delay in the issuance of degrees by the University of Engineering and Technology to PhD and MPhil students He said the students deposited fee in the bank but the amount was not shown in the university account causing the issue.
“The bank officials received the amount and issued receipts but didn’t credit the amount in the university’s account,” he said.

Addressing a press conference at the Bacha Khan Markaz here following the party’s general council meeting, he said decisions by a three-member bench of the apex court on important constitutional matters were creating a wrong impression. “Weren’t there any other judges of the apex court except these three judges to decide important cases,” he said.
He said in one party’s case, the court had considered its head as a source of power, while in the case of the other the same role was accorded to the parliamentary leader.
He said it was regrettable that the Punjab government and 10 political parties had boycotted the hearing on the ruling of the Punjab Assembly’s deputy speaker.
“The Supreme Court becoming controversial would be unfortunate for Pakistan,” he said.
Mr Hoti said political issues reaching before the courts were a failure of the political forces,” he said.
He feared that in the case of elections before the electoral reforms, two-third majority would be given to a party for making controversial constitutional amendments.
“We are seeing attempts to roll back the 18th Constitutional Amendment,” he said.
He said without electoral reforms, all future elections would be controversial.

3,Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmaker takes centre to court over halt to ex-Fata healthcare funding,Mohammad Shafiq Afridi has also challenged non-provision of share in NFC Award to tribal districts.,"PESHAWAR: A member of the provincial assembly (MPA) of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has challenged the federal government’s act of stopping funding for free medical treatment of the residents of tribal districts under the Sehat Card Plus (SCP) programme and non-provision of three per cent share in the National Finance Commission’s divisible pool for the region previously called Fata.
In the petition, Mohammad Shafiq Afridi requested the Peshawar High Court to declare that the people of tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are entitled to their due share under the NFC Award, which is three per cent of the NFC divisible pool.
He prayed the court to declare that the act of the federal government to stop funding for the SCP in respect of the people of tribal districts is illegal and rooted in malice.
The petitioner, who belongs to Khyber tribal district, requested the court to order the federal government for the release of funding for the SCP for the people of tribal districts.

He also challenges non-provision of share in NFC Award to tribal districts

He requested the court to direct the federal government to immediately release the share in the NFC of tribal districts for their development.
The respondents in the petition filed through Ali Gohar Durrani advocate included the federal government through the secretary of the Cabinet Division, Finance Division through its secretary, national health services ministry through its secretary, planning and development ministry through its secretary,Council of Common Interest and National economic Council through their respective secretaries, KP chief secretary, and provincial health and finance secretaries.
The petitioner said the provincial government had initiated its flagship ‘Sehat Card Universal Health Care Card’ programme for its citizens.
He said under the programme, more than 7.2 million families of KP were getting free in-patient health services.
The petitioner said initially, the facility was launched in some parts of the province but later, it was extended to the entire province, where people were able to get healthcare free of charge at private and public sector hospitals.
He said the previous government at the centre had initiated a scheme like the Sehat Card for the people of tribal districts, but the two programs were run without harmony.
The petitioner said to harmonise the two health schemes which were at variance, the KP finance minister had written a letter to the federal finance minister on Oct 10, 2021, seeking the transfer of funding to the province for the population of tribal districts in respect of the Sehat Card programme.
He said as a consequence, the national health services ministry moved a summary to the then prime minister for harmonising the Sehat Card packages.
The petitioner said the proposal was approved by the then prime minister on Feb 21, 2022, and the same was communicated to the chief executive officer of the Social Health Protection Initiative of the health department through a letter on Feb 23, 2022.
Referring to several written communications among the KP government, NHS ministry and finance division, he said no action was taken by the federal government to ensure continuity of services to residents of tribal districts.
As an interim arrangement, he said the provincial government had agreed to ensure continuity of the Sehat Card facility to the people of tribal districts.
He added that the director of the Social Health Protection Initiative wrote a letter on July 5 to the State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan whereby decision of the Provincial Cabinet in respect of shifting the Sehat Card beneficiaries of tribal districts to the SCP was communicated but it was made clear that it was an interim arrangement.
The petitioner said the share of tribal districts as per the NFC Award, which came to three per cent and had to be contributed by the three provinces (other than Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and the federation had not yet materialised.
He added that the provincial assembly had adopted a resolution asking the federal government to grant three per cent of the NFC’s divisible pool for the development of tribal districts.

5,PHC seeks govt reply in church construction case,PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday directed the provincial government to respond to a petition against the...,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Tuesday directed the provincial government to respond to a petition against the release of funds by Mardan’s district administration for a church’s construction on private land.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Shahid Khan issued the order on a petition filed by priest Murad Mushtaq challenging construction of the church by a member of his Christian community, Amanat Masih, on a private plot for which Rs5 million was released by the administration of Mardan district on the recommendations of minority MPA Ravi Kumar.
The petitioner claimed that the MPA was not authorised by the law to make such recommendations.
The bench fixed Aug 9 for next hearing into the case. 
The court has already stayed the church’s construction.
Lawyer Shaukat Ghulam appeared for the petitioner and said the administration could not allocate funds for the construction of a private place of worship.
He added that under the rules, a person setting up a church on private land had to declare the property a trust and prepare ‘entitlement documents’ to prove that the property would not be owned by an individual and would belong to Christian community.
He said MPA Ravi Kumar had ordered the release of funds Rs5 million for construction of that church claiming that these were his discretionary funds.
He added that the said MPA could not order release of any such funds as he was neither a minister nor aide to the chief minister.
Advocate Rohit Kumar appeared for Amanat Masih and said the land in question was owned of his client, who had already declared it a trust property for the church’s construction.
He said the church was being built in an area populated by Christians.
Advocate general Shumail Ahmad Butt and additional advocate general Babar Shehzad Imran said the matter was related to the Christian community, which should resolve it by dialogue.
The bench directed them to file comments about the petition on behalf of the government and explain if the funds for the church’s construction were released by the government or not.

7,Concern about low admissions in KP govt hospitals under Sehat Card scheme,Officials blame it on lack of incentives for staff members.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has voiced concern about low admissions in government hospitals under the Sehat Card Plus programme and directed the relevant officials to ensure the entry of more and more patients to those hospitals for free treatment for better revenue.
Private hospitals earn more than 85pc of the money generated by the programme.
The Lady Reading Hospital, a medical teaching institution, will carry out all admissions under the SCP scheme from Aug 1, according to its spokesman, Mohammad Asim.
Chairman of the LRH Board of Governors Prof Nausherwan Barki told Dawn that he was unhappy to see that only 50pc of the admissions were done under SCP and therefore, he had directed the management to double the percentage.
“Patients should bring their computerised national identity cards and Form B along to get free treatment. The LRH hasn’t admitted a large number of patients under the SCP for being without CNICs, which is mandatory under rules to avail free treatment under the PTI government’s flagship initiative,” he said.

Officials blame it on lack of incentives for staff members

Prof Barki, who is also the chairman of the MTI Policy Board in the province, said since the SCP scheme was universally applicable to all families in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, there should not be any problem for patients to claim free treatment.
“All MTIs should fully facilities patients under the programme,” he said.
Officials said health minister Taimur Khan Jhagra, health secretary Amir Sultan Tareen and SCP CEO Dr Mohammad Riaz Tanoli had been trying to facilitate the government-owned facilities and semi-autonomous MTIs to enhance admissions under the cashless programme and increase revenue to upgrade services and benefit employees.
They, however, said with a few exceptions, public sector hospitals had yet to take financial benefit from the initiative up to the desired level.
The figures show that 1.288 million patients have been admitted under the programme since 2016. Of them, 883,488 went to private hospitals, 208,213 to public hospitals and 196,802 to MTIs. The government has spent Rs31.7 billion on the provision of free health services to patients. These facilities have earned Rs22 billion, Rs5 billion and Rs4.5 billion revenue respectively with the private ones receiving far more money than what was generated by MTIs and public hospitals together.
Health officials said the main reason behind the failure of public sector hospitals was a lack of incentives to the employees from the income of the SCP patients.
They said two years ago, the health department had asked state-owned facilities to enforce ‘Fund Retention and Utilisation/Distribution Formula’ for the amount received through the programme, which hadn’t been fully implemented by most hospitals.
The officials said the private hospitals had already treated patients on payment and thus, generating more revenue from the SCP than the public sector ones.
They said under the formula, the hospitals had to spend 25pc funds from the SCP programme to improve patient care, do repairs and maintenance besides giving 30pc to doctors and 20pc for consumables and 15pc to nursing and paramedical staff and 10pc for administrative cost.
The officials said a few hospitals had followed the formula due to which their revenue had increased, whereas most failed to do so.
They said under the formula, the committees had been formed in hospitals under the respective medical superintendents but the situation didn’t improve.
The officials said the hospitals, where the formula had been enforced, continued to record more admissions and revenue as staff members got share in the money generated that way.
They said the health department had been asking public sector hospitals to adopt the models of MTI Hayatabad Medical Complex and Peshawar Institute of Cardiology to be able to enhance their admissions under the programme.
