A two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro observed that the possibility of both brothers’ disappearance on their own could not be ruled out as according to police they were dismissed from police service due to involvement in criminal activities and their cell phones were also working.
Ghulam Mustafa petitioned the SHC stating that his two brothers — Ghulam Murtaza Bullo and Mohammad Ashraf Bullo — were picked up by the law enforcement agencies on June 14 from a Malir locality.
Expressing the apprehension about their lives, he stated that their whereabouts were still unknown and pleaded for their recovery.
The Malir SSP, who is cited as one of the respondents in the petition, filed comments stating that both the alleged detainees were former police constables and had been dismissed from service on misconduct and involvement in criminal activities.
He said that they had a criminal record since 1996 and were nominated in several FIRs registered at different police stations of the city.
The SSP submitted that their cellular data record showed that their mobile phones were being constantly used.

1,"KU teachers hold protest, call for selection boards to fill vacant posts","KARACHI: Ignoring intermittent rain, several teachers gathered at Karachi University on Tuesday to hold a protest...","KARACHI: Ignoring intermittent rain, several teachers gathered at Karachi University on Tuesday to hold a protest demonstration at the administration block, demanding a schedule for the selection boards advertised in 2019.
The protest, a second in two weeks, was held against the backdrop of a selection board, scheduled for July 25, which was postponed due to bad weather.
The speakers at the protest demonstration including Dr Moiz Khan, Dr Naila Siddiqua, Dr Faizan Naqvi and Dr Irfan Aziz resolved that their demonstration would continue till a permanent schedule for the selection boards was announced.
According to officials, the selection boards advertised in 2019 pertain to the entire university with 42 departments, including institutes and centres.
There are 136 vacant posts for lecturer, 45 for assistant professors, 37 for associate professors and 110 vacant posts for professors.
There are said to be 350 internal candidates while the total number of external candidates stands around 6,000.
Highlighting their grievances, the protesting teachers said the selection boards were belatedly advertised in 2019 and then being delayed on one or the other reasons due to which many teachers, who had been waiting for their promotions for a long time, had either retired or about to hit their retirement age.
“While selection boards for other departments haven’t been announced at all in four years, this is the third time that the selection board for the posts for associate professor at the Institute of Environmental Studies (IES) was postponed yesterday. This is highly unfair and frustrating for senior teachers,” said Dr Farhat Hussain, part of the newly formed KU Selection Board Action Committee.
Dr Hussain has been an assistant professor at KU’s department of library and information science for 27 years and will retire in the coming months.
Sharing his views, senior teacher Dr Riaz Ahmed said both provincial government and the university administration were part of the problem.
“The government wants to control the universities, which is why it introduced a new clause in the amended act of 2018 and made the universities and boards secretary a member of the varsity’s selection board. This happened for the first time and the objective has been to interfere in the teachers’ hiring process,” he contended.
The government, he said, already had representation in different statutory bodies and there was no need to introduce a new member.
He cited the Jan 31 selection board proceedings, which were being organised on the Sindh High Court orders but were declared null and void by the universities and boards secretary in the same meeting on grounds that the vice chancellor needed to take prior permission for the process from the government.
“The secretary has no authority under the act to make such a decision. There is no clause in the act which says that the university is required to take permission from the chief minister to hold a selection board,” Dr Ahmed said, adding that the university under an acting vice chancellor needed to assert its administrative authority.
“The solution is that the university administration announces schedule for the selection boards without a further delay and remove the condition for foreign referees in the hiring process. The KU is the only university in the whole country which sends dossiers of candidates to foreign referees for approval. There is no such clause in the act or the 2019 advertisement.”
Pointing to lack of transparency in appointments, Dr Ahmed said that last month the chief minister had appointed the director of the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Chair at KU without any selection board.
Upon contact, Karachi University Teachers’ Society (Kuts) president Prof Shah Ali ul Qader, however, distanced the society from the protesting body.
“Their demand is genuine and we support it. But, we believe that the university administration has all intentions to hold the selection boards soon. The major problem has been to meet the quorum required to hold a selection board,” he said.
KU Registrar Prof Maqsood Ali Ansari said the administration had received permission from the chief minister to hold IES’ selection board and scheduled it thrice. “In the first case, they were declared null and void by the secretary universities and boards. Later, it was scheduled in June but adjourned due to lack of quorum. Yesterday, the reason for postponement was bad weather. Now, we intend to hold it next week.”
For the rest of selection boards, he said he had recently written a letter to the chief minister seeking permission for the hiring process.
“Right now, the major problem is to complete the four-member quorum required to hold a selection board. Since the dean science is also holding the acting charge of the vice chancellor, she can’t be part of the selection board. One nominee of the syndicate has just completed her term and can’t be part of the board. More recently, a new chairman of Sindh Public Service Commission has been appointed and now we have to wait for a new commission nominee,” he explained.

3,"Rain-hit residents berate DHA, CBC for flooded roads, big puddles",Say they get nothing in return despite paying heavy taxes; army called in to drain out rainwater...,"KARACHI: “We don’t get water through the lines, we get it through the gutters during monsoons. And that gutter water covers up for the lack of water from the lines for the entire year,” screamed a resident of DHA Phase 6 upon being asked the water level situation in his area on Tuesday.  
“There is the Defence Housing Authority and the Cantonment Board Clifton here, which are there only to provide jobs to retired military men. None of them are here to take responsibility for anything. The plots they get in this so-called posh area, they sell off to make a quick buck. If the DHA was inhabited by military personnel I’m sure the situation would have been very different here.  
“But no one cares about us civilians. We get no facilities in return for the heavy taxes we pay for owning property in Defence. There is not even a government hospital in DHA or Clifton to cater to the needs of residents here,” vented another DHA Phase 4 resident, whose lawn and parking area was in a four-foot-deep water and he had no electricity since it started raining again three days ago.  
The worst hit streets in Phase 4 were Golf Course roads 1 to 5, 9th Commercial Street and Commercial Avenue, which has a storm-water drain running right in the centre that fills up as soon as it starts raining because it is mostly blocked.  

Say they get nothing in return despite paying heavy taxes; army called in to drain out rainwater

Camran Khan, another resident of Phase 6 informed that his street, Street No 5 off Khayaban-i-Seher, was flooded with sewage even before the current spell of rains. “Our street has been flooded with sewage since July 9. And nothing is being done about it despite constant complaints to CBC,” he said.  
Burglaries in vacant homes 
Several residents, whose homes are surrounded with sewage and they are without electricity, said that they could have moved in with relatives living in areas where the situation was better, but didn’t because they were also hearing about burglaries in vacant homes. 
“There are suspicious people roaming about. We have seen them ourselves. They seem to be doing research on which home they can enter. The knee-deep water doesn’t seem to bother them. There is nothing to stop them from entering to steal from our homes. So we are also trying to stay put at our residences despite the misery,” said an elderly lady on 17th Street in Phase 1. 
There are many water pumps put in place by the CBC and they are working in all the inundated areas, but things are not improving because they are not as fast as the accumulation of rainwater and sewage water in these places.  
“Either the drains where they are trying to pump the water out from are choked or it is high tide,” explained a resident of Phase 7.  
Khayaban-i-Bukhari’s secondary market, known as Chota Bukhari, paints a similar picture as the entire area, along with the housing blocks around it, remained inundated.  
Like at the time of the previous rains two years ago, many shops and offices in the basements of the market have once again been destroyed, and most of the shops remain closed as the area is not accessible to residents. 
Residents help each other 
The DHA and CBC have arranged tankers to suck the dirty water. There are around 16 such tankers placed at Bara (big) Bukhari and eight of the same at Chota Bukhari in Phase 5 and 6 along with five more in Phase 4.  
“Had it not been for the kind-hearted residents of DHA who are in a somewhat better position, we would have seen huge tragedies happening here. They are rescuing people in 4x4s and SUVs. They have organised themselves in a club called the Offroad Club. They are distributing food, medicine and groceries. Even the NGOs rescuing people in inflated dinghies are doing a good job. And looking at the residents helping each other, the NGO volunteers at work, the CBC is also showing some activity, however little,” said another disgruntled resident of Phase 6.  
“How about CBC compensating all the residents for the losses they have suffered again with the money they take from us in the name of taxes as we don’t get any facilities in return?” Asked another resident of Chota Bukhari in Phase 6.  
The situation compelled residents to remain indoors and the authorities to block vehicular traffic on several roads.  
Residents say that gravity of the situation is such that in a huge block, with Khayaban-i-Saba and 26th Street on two ends, and Khayban-i-Seher and Khayaban-i-Muslim on the other two, every single street is flooded.  
Many parts of Khayaban-i-Shujaat in Phase 6 are equally affected.  
A portion of the 26th Street, which is the main artery in the area, between Seher and Muhafiz intersections, has been blocked for vehicular traffic by authorities because of extremely high water level.  
Some staff of the CBC has been making efforts for the last two days to drain out the water, but without much relief to the residents.  
Some parts of Khayaban-i-Muhafiz said to be the worst-hit areas where on Tuesday army troops were seen involved in pumping out water.  
Residents said though the authorities were making serious efforts, a limited number of suction pumps were making their job extremely difficult.  
Many residents, while expressing their helplessness, had only the DHA and CBC to blame. They were unanimous on one point that both these organisations have learnt absolutely no lesson from the catastrophe of 2020 when torrential rains had it looked like part of the Arabian Sea.

5,Builder granted bail in building collapse case,KARACHI: A court on Tuesday granted bail to the builder of an illegally built residential-cum-commercial building...,"KARACHI: A court on Tuesday granted bail to the builder of an illegally built residential-cum-commercial building that had collapsed during rains in Moosa Colony.
Police booked Amir alias Baba, said to be a police employee, over allegedly using substandard material and negligence and illegal construction of a six-storey building that collapsed on July 18.
On Tuesday, the investigating officer produced the suspect before Judicial Magistrate (Central) Ghulam Sarwar Solangi to seek his remand in police custody for interrogation.
The IO submitted that a deputy director of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation had lodged an FIR against the owner of the building and officials of the Sindh Building Control Authority for their alleged negligence that led to the caving in of the building.
He requested for 14-day physical remand of the held suspect in police custody for interrogation and completion of the investigation and other legal formalities.
On the other hand, the suspect, through his counsel, moved an application seeking grant of post-arrest bail. The counsel argued that the sections under which the FIR had been lodged were bailable, hence he pleaded to admit the applicant to a bail.
The magistrate granted post-arrest bail to the suspect subject to furnishing a surety in sum of Rs10,000 with direction to cooperate with the police during investigation.
A case was registered under Sections 286 (negligent conduct with explosive substance), 288 (negligent conduct with building), 290 (public nuisance), 119 (public servant concealing design), 427 (mischief), 109 (abetment), 114 (abettor present when offence committed) and 34 (common intention) of Pakistan Penal Code at the Gulberg police station.

7,Magistrate orders IO to produce Dua today amid security,Says purpose of production within 24 hours was to safeguard the rights of the minor/child.,"KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Tuesday directed the investigating officer to produce teenage Dua Zehra in court on Wednesday (today) amid full security.
Judicial Magistrate (East) Aftab Ahmed Bughio passed this order on an application filed by her purported husband, Zaheer Ahmed, under Section 17(2) of the Sindh Child Protection Authority (Amendment) Act, 2021 read with Section 3 of the Juvenile Justice System Act, 2018.
His counsel Amir Riyaz argued that it was a legal requirement that whenever the custody of any child was received by the child protection officer it was incumbent upon the officer to produce the child before the nearest magistrate within a period of 24 hours.
He added that the purpose of production within 24 hours was to safeguard the rights of the minor/child.

Order was passed on her purported husband Zaheer’s plea

A judicial magistrate in Lahore, while permitting the custody of the minor, had also passed the same order for her production before the Karachi’s trial court under safe custody, he added.
Complainant’s counsel Zaheer Hussain opposed the application.
The judge observed there was a legal question whether Dua — who has been shifted from Darul Aman, Lahore to the Child Protection Authority in compliance with the orders of the courts of competent jurisdiction — was to be produced before the trial court within the specified period or might be produced when the matter was already fixed for hearing.
He recalled that the incumbent court through its order dated July 22 on an application filed by the mother of Dua under Rules 9 and 10 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Rules, 2016 had passed an order for production of the minor on the date already fixed for the submission of the investigation report.
However, he added, that the minor admittedly is shifted from Darul Aman in Lahore to the Child Protection Authority in Karachi on July 24.
The magistrate opined that immediate production of the minor was necessary as provided under Section 17(2) (Amendment) to Child Protection Act, 2021 and Rule 10 of the Child Marriage Restraint Rules, 2016.
Allowing the application, the magistrate directed the IO to produce the custody of Dua Zehra on July 27 at 09:30am.
He further ordered that the IO shall produce the minor through a Child Protection Officer and no person from either side should get a chance to meet with her.
The court also ordered that no other person, except the advocates of the case, would be present in the courtroom at the time of production of the minor.

8,Lawmaker’s relatives beat up owner of pharmacy,HYDERABAD: Brother and nephew of a Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) member of Sindh Assembly beat up a...,"HYDERABAD: Brother and nephew of a Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) member of Sindh Assembly beat up a pharmacy shop owner in Latifabad Unit-6 on Sunday night after verbal clash over parking of vehicle outside the shop. The pharmacist has lodged a report with B-Section police for legal action against his tormentors.
The complainant Abdul Khaliq Rajput said that Umer Siddiqui, brother of MPA Nadeem Siddiqui, had parked his car in front of the shop in Latifabad Unit-6 and walked to a nearby outlet to buy rotis while his family members sat in the vehicle.
After some time, he claimed, his employee requested Umer to leave some space for the customers who came to buy drugs at the shop from a nearby hospital. “It angered Umer and he traded hot words with the employee. Then I intervened and told Umer he had unnecessarily overreacted to the employee’s request,” Khaliq said.
Shortly afterwards, he said, Umer came back with a few men, grabbed him by the collar and slapped him repeatedly. Footage from a close circuit television camera in the shop that went viral afterwards showed that both Umer and MPA’s brother Nabeel Siddiqui had grabbed the shopkeeper and slapped him repeatedly before some customers intervened and saved Khaliq.
Khaliq said in an application submitted to the SSP complaint cell that when his employee spoke to Umer, he issued threats and left but after 10 minutes the man came back armed with a pistol, forced into the shop and beaten him up. He sought registration of an FIR against them.
But MPA Nadeem Siddiqui disputed the pharmacist’s version and said that Umer was waiting in the car after placing order for rotis at the shop adjacent to the pharmacy. He also shared a video of his nephew as he parked his car outside the shop. “In fact, Abdul Khaliq first hurled abuses at Umer which infuriated him and it led to the incident,” he said.

9,Darawat Dam overflows for first time since 2014 inception,HYDERABAD: Water being stored in Darawat Dam spilled over its banks on Monday night for the first time since 2014...,"HYDERABAD: Water being stored in Darawat Dam spilled over its banks on Monday night for the first time since 2014 amid torrential rains continuing in the region for over a week. Such flows were received through hill torrents of Nai Baran, a natural waterway in the area.
Chief Engineer Small Dams Project of Sindh government Shafqat Wadhu confirmed on Tuesday that water flows started spilling at 2:30am Tuesday. “Water flows are still spilling over and flowing to take route of Nai Baran, where the dam has been built. The dam has attained its maximum storage level of 112.55 metres,” he said.
“Water storage can go up to 118 metre and spillways will keep working as well,” he added. He noted that the dam’s catchment area was continuously receiving water from torrents, forcing people to move to safer places. “The dam’s lake area, where water is stored, is quite huge,” he said.
Darawat Dam was built in Jamshoro but the area planned to be irrigated by its water falls in Thatta district. It is rain-fed area. The dam was inaugurated in March 2013 by then president Asif Ali Zardari. Its construction was started in 2010 by Wapda during PPP government. 
The dam was completed at a cost of Rs11.67bn. Since its construction, it could not attain its maximum storage level of 112.55 metres. It is currently under Sindh government’s small dams department’s administration and perhaps it is the first dam of such a big size which is being managed by the irrigation department. After completion, Wapda had handed it over to Sindh government.
Bane for local population?
According to reports from the area, the communities living in the dam’s upstream reservoir/lake area is facing serious issues relating to inundation as torrent and rainwater had entered their homes in several villages. An exact number of affected people could not be ascertained. An estimate of damage to the area is also unavailable. Some residents of the area said that they were facing serious problem due to heavy flows of torrents in Nai Baran which feeds this rain-dependent area. People are refusing to leave their abodes, said an official. 
Jamshoro Deputy Commissioner Farid Mustafa told Dawn that the district administration along with army personnel had on Monday evacuated some families upstream the dam. He said that the people who had climbed mountains in the area were provided food, water and other relief goods by the administration through the route of Jangri. Camels were used for transporting the relief goods, he added. These people, he said, had refused to leave their area.
It was learnt that some communities had also settled downstream the dam considering the fact that the dam never attained its maximum storage level nor did it spill water over the last eight years. They were now asked to move to safe places because gushing flows from the dam could hit them.
Even during the period of water storage in the area, supplies were not made to attain any level in the dam for irrigation purpose because Sindh government had not been able to complete development work of its command area. Land acquisition issues also remained unresolved downstream the dam.
Locals resist land survey
These issues were to be addressed by the Thatta district administration and revenue department after verification of land record. When revenue officials from Thatta district visited the area, some community fellows raised objection over the intended survey for land-related issues. Such survey has still remained pending. “The command area can’t be developed unless the survey is done,” said an official. He said similar issues were pending upstream dam in the reservoir area.
The Nai Baran flows, primarily stored in Darawat Dam, would keep taking their route up to the sea in Thatta. “Water from the dam can be released even if it has a storage of 104 metres but it is not recommended as this will cause siltation problem in the dam’s structure. However, flows can be released when it is a little above 105 metres or 106 metres,” said a former Wapda official, who had been associated with the dam’s operation until it was not handed over to Sindh government.

The rainfall raised water level in Manchhar Lake to 115 feet RL (reduced level) on Tuesday from 113 feet RL a day before and caused shortage of medicines, clean drinking water and food in the marooned villages.
The intermittent heavy rain in Khirthar Range of mountains over the past eight days has rapidly filled the lake though natural rain drains (nullahs) of Jhangara, Bajara Naing, Nai Taki, Nai Sol, Nai Nali and Nai Angai.
Mahesh Kumar, engineer of irrigation department posted at the lake, said that if the lake level rose to 116 feet RL it would begin putting pressure on its embankments and might prove dangerous. The department had advised district administrations of Jamshoro and Dadu to urge people living along the lake embankments to shift to safe places as the continuous rain in Khirthar range might spell danger for them, he said.
He said that 500 cusecs of water was drained out of the lake into the river on Monday and 700 cusecs on Tuesday through Aral head canal near Sehwan to keep the lake level within safe limits.
Superintending engineer Mohammad Alam Rahpoto said that flood-fighting material had been brought to FP dyke and lake embankments and he was constantly monitoring Nai Gaj water flows into the lake from his camp to keep the situation under control.  
Dadu deputy commissioner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah told reporters the situation was not that bad in Kachho and army personnel had been kept on the standby in case their services were needed.
Despite possible danger to the lake’s embankments from the rising lake level in the wake of continuous rain, local fishermen are overjoyed to see the fresh rainwater filling up the lake.
Moula Bux Mallah, chairman of Manchhar Bachayo Ittehad, said that the rainwater would decrease pollution level in the lake water and help production of fish. 
Aslam Mallah, a fisherman, demanded the irrigation department should not drain out the lake water into the river and let the lake fill up with freshwater.

12,Poet Sarmad Chandio’s ‘extraordinary work’ for promotion of Sindhi literature hailed,"LARKANA: Speakers at a condolence reference paid tribute to writer, researcher and poet Sarmad Chandio, who passed...","LARKANA: Speakers at a condolence reference paid tribute to writer, researcher and poet Sarmad Chandio, who passed away last week, for his extraordinary contribution to Sindhi literature and flawless art of versification.
The reference was held to commemorate late Chandio at Arts Council Larkana under the aegis of its literature department on Monday evening. 
Prof Mukhtiar Samo, writer and founder of Knowledge Centre Larkana who presided over the gathering, said that Chandio was a dedicated and indefatigable writer and researcher, who had written 75 books on poetry and prose equal to 75 years of his age. Many of the books were yet to be published, he said. 
Chandio was considered an authority on illm-e-Urooz and shandveidya, the prosody of versification, and two different structural techniques of composing different genres of poetry in Sindhi and other languages. 
His work on great Sufi poet Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai was unique of its kind in which he tested couplets (bait) of Bhitai on the basis of that technique and found them highly perfect. 
His novel on Bhitai was yet to be published which he had written in his lifetime. Chandio had produced many students in poetry who had now earned big name and fame through their poetic works, he said.
Faqeer Paryal Dayo, secretary general [central] of one faction of Sindhi Adabi Sangat, said that Chandio had a special flair of composing geet and wai, two peculiar and original genres of Sindhi poetry. 
Aziz Qasimani, son of Chandio who was a poet in his own right, said that his father was among pioneers of meter of Sindhi poetry. His poetry was great depth of thought and was an example of flawless art of versification, he said.
Dr Ahsan Danish said that Chandio’s poetry was a conglomeration of classic and modern traditions of Sindhi poetry. 
Adil Abbasi said that Chandio was very loud in his thinking, which was manifested in his poetry and other literary works. He was a good speaker as well who spoke smoothly and convincingly on any topic of literature, he said. 
Prof Jam Jamali, former secretary of Arts Council, said that Chandio’s contribution to richness of Sindhi literature would always be remembered. 
Dr Riaz Buriro said that Chandio was very active in progressive politics in his past but when he came to literature he did not look back and did a huge literary work. 
Dr Preh Sakina Gaad said that they had learnt a great deal from Chandio in many literary gatherings. His speeches were full of information and inspired everyone in the audience, she said.
Malhar Sindhi, chairman of literature department of Arts Council, said that it was obligatory upon them to pay homage to the writers, who worked selflessly for the promotion of literature, while they were alive. 
Among others who spoke on the occasion were; Prof Ghulam Hussain Katpar, Sattar Hullio, Panjal Sangi, Ustad Gul Dayo, Hubdar Totani, Madhosh Bhutto, Koral Kurbdar, Saleem Raza Kumhar, Saleh Abbasi, Ashfaque Chandio, Punhal Jagirani, Deedar Shaikh and Sughar Dado Dittal Abro.

They said that the work would be completed on Wednesday (today) but water supply to the city from the canal might not be restored until Friday.
Karachi Water and Sewerage Board vice chairman Najmi Alam told Dawn that the protected wall had been erected to plug the breach and the work on it would continue during the night hours so that the water supply to the city would be restored as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, Local Government Secretary Engineer Syed Najam Ahmad Shah visited the canal on Hub River Road and reviewed the alternative arrangements for water supply to the city from Hub Dam.
The LG secretary said that no interruption in the repairing works would be tolerated and all the required machinery, equipments and manpower should be utilised to solve the issue as soon as possible and uninterrupted supply of water should be made possible to the residents of the city.
He hoped that in the next 48 hours, the rehabilitation process of water shortage affected areas would start and the things will become better gradually.
Meanwhile, the K-Ele­ctric said that an eme­r­gency had been imposed as the rainfall in Hub had caused an extraordinary amount of water spill out from the dam.
A KE spokesman said that the power supply to the area was affected early Tuesday morning due to a damage sustained by a 132kV transmission tower.

In another incident, a young man drowned in the Malir river in Salih Mohammed Goth near Malok hotel. Edhi divers recovered the body. He was identified as Shahzeb, 25.
Rain affects traffic flow
Meanwhile, the traffic police said that continued rains led to flooding of several roads that disturbed the smooth flow of traffic on Tuesday.
A spokesperson for the Karachi traffic police said that because of accumulation of rainwater on Superhighway, traffic flow from New Sabzi Mandi towards Toll Plaza was adversely affected. 
Heavy rains also damaged roads and a big crater was created on National Highway near Manzil Pump. A trailer fell in the ditch forcing the traffic police to divert vehicular traffic to alternative routes. 
A pothole has also been developed at a bridge on the Malir river due to accumulation of rainwater. 
The spokesperson said that there were at least 35 spots in different parts of the metropolis where accumulated rainwater hindered smooth flow of traffic. 
Korangi, Saddar receive highest rainfall
The city witnessed light to moderate rains in different parts of the city in the first half of the day. 
By 5pm the Met office recorded 19.5 millimetre rains in Korangi followed by Saddar that received 12mm.
“Monsoon rains likely to continue during the week and weaken in Sindh from July 28,” said a brief statement by the Met office.
It added that by July 27 Karachi and other parts of Sindh, including Tharparkar, Umarkot, Mirpurkhas, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Tando Mohammad Khan, Tando Allayar, Hyderabad, Matiari, Sanghar, Nawabshah, Khairpur, Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Dadu, Jamshoro, Shikarpur, Qambar Shahdadkot, Ghotki and Kashmore districts are likely to receive widespread rain-wind/thunderstorms with scattered heavy/very heavy falls.
Although there was no major rain on Tuesday, the city was still reeling from the damages of ‘very heavy’ Sunday rains and several areas of the city did not get normal even after 72 hours.
The main reason is accumulated rainwater in streets and overflowing sewage in most city districts.
The city administration was trying to clear major roads but fell short of paying attention to residential areas of Karachi.
In South district, Kharadar, Saddar, Ramswami and many other areas have become unliveable due to sewage on roads and solid waste.
The situation remained same in Korangi, East, West, and Central districts.
Moreover, the already frail infrastructures of the city destroyed by the heavy rains were in process of repairing, adding miseries to life of citizens.
The residents of Korangi, Korangi Industrial Area and Landhi were left with no option but to travel on the vulnerable Jam Sadiq Bridge to go to main city areas after Korangi Causeway was damaged in rains. The causeway is yet to be made commutable.
