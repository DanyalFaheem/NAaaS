0,Senator Raza Rabbani warns ‘intervention’ to affect parliament,"Writes letter to Senate chairman, NA; says systematic feeding of parliament on bacteria and fungi have caused the rot to start.","ISLAMABAD: Former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani has warned that any “soft intervention” by the military would directly affect the parliament.
In separate but identical letters to the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker, Mr Rabbani urged them to play their role in saving the parliament, insisting that the federal and parliamentary character and system in Pakistan had been under persistent attack from the ruling elite. 
The PPP senator said that during Pakistan’s 75-year history, the elite had experimented with several governing systems, including military dictatorships, One Unit, presidential and quasi-presidential forms, party-less elections, unelected majlis-i-shoora (parliament), and chief executive and controlled parliamentary systems.
“These systems were against the grain of the founding father’s vision for Pakistan,” he wrote. “They were unable to appreciate the political, economic and cultural diversity of the federation.” 

Deplores Pakistan’s ‘Ayubian’ elite, likens it to Bonapartists

He said parliament was deliberately crippled and thus failed to synthesise this heterogeneity and fell into disarray. 
Mr Rabbani said that similar to Bonapartists, supporters of the political movement in France that aimed to restore the French empire under the house of Bonaparte, a part of the ruling elite in Pakistan was Ayubian and had always sought to restore the constitution of 1962 and its economic and cultural dispensation. 
In order to achieve such ends with mala fide intent, the inclusiveness of parliament was being replaced by the marginalisation of provinces and their diverse people, Mr Rabbani said. 
“The systematic feeding of parliament on bacteria and fungi have caused the rot to start and the process of decomposing parliament has started,” he said. 
“As a result of which, the trichotomy of power envisaged in the Constitution is being trampled, the unbridled right of parliament to legislate within the limits defined by the Constitution is being questioned, presiding officers are being summoned, and Article 69 of the Constitution has all but ceased to exist.” 
He asked the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker to act collectively to preserve and protect the parliament as envisaged in the Constitution. 
Mr Rabbani also floated the idea that a meeting of surviving presiding officers of both houses be called to assess the situation and suggest a way forward to ""save parliament"".

2,Software to conduct first-ever digital census enters pilot phase,"Nadra chairman says 59,569 structures, 58,882 households, and 74,536 people enumerated during ongoing phase.","ISLAMABAD: The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) has initiated the pilot test of the digital solution which will be used to conduct first-ever digital census in the country. 
The pilot test — which is underway in 429 census blocks of 83 tehsils across the four provinces, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir — was preceded by an initial testing. 
The development came to light in a meeting of the Census Monitoring Committee presided by Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday. 
The meeting was attended by the representatives of Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), finance ministry, Nadra, Council of Common Interests (CCI), National Telecom Corporation and all provinces including AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan. 
Nadra chairman Tariq Malik told the meeting that the digital solution was developed using modern agile methodology in just three weeks. 
He added that during the ongoing pilot phase, 59,569 structures, 58,882 households and 74,536 people have been enumerated. 
Mr Malik briefed the committee that the solution included deployment of android-based house listings and enumeration application synchronised with global positioning system (GPS) and geographical information system (GIS), data centre and call centre services and establishment of technical support centres at tehsil level, along with an online web portal for the public. 
The system will ensure accuracy, accountability and transparency throughout the process, the Nadra chairman added. 
The android-based digital applications have online and offline support with seamless data synchronisation feature. The system will support the PBS in all three stages of the census i.e., pre census stage, census stage and post census stage. 
Nadra was extending data centre services for a centralised repository of census data, along with digital imageries at the PBS. 
Furthermore, a user-friendly web portal has been developed to enable people register the cases of their non-availability at the time of census exercise. 
Earlier in January, the CCI approved the conduct of Seventh Population and Housing Census and the establishment of the census monitoring committee. Subsequently, the PBS signed an agreement with Nadra in June to develop a comprehensive digital solution to carry out the census.

Meanwhile, the PTI has blasted the government for further burdening the inflation-ridden masses by a massive increase in the power tariff.
PTI leaders said that the miseries of the people had been compounded manifold due to cabal of crooks’ callous attitude towards them, as they were more interested in protecting their power than easing people’s woes.
PTI Punjab Secretary General Hammad Azhar, in a post on social media, lashed out at the government for further increase in the price of electricity. He said the government had raised the power tariff by Rs3.50 per unit which had been rejected by the PTI. 

 





 
Meanwhile, PTI’s senior leader Imran Ismail said that the ‘imported government’ had increased the power tariff amid the constitutional and political crisis in the country.
In a statement issued here, he said the incompetent government had unleashed a wave of unprecedented inflation and the increase in power tariff would multiply the woes of people. He said the government had quietly increased the price of electricity at a time when the rain had play­­ed havoc across the country.
