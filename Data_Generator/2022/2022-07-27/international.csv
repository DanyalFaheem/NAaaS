0,US says China’s ‘provocations’ threaten major incident,The comments come ahead of an anticipated call between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping this week.,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Tuesday accused China of increased  “provocations” against rival claimants in the South China Sea and said its  “aggressive and irresponsible behavior’ meant it was only a matter of time before a major incident or accident.
Jung Pak, deputy assistant secretary for East Asia at the State Department, told a US think tank there was  “a clear and upward trend of PRC provocations against South China Sea claimants and other states lawfully operating in the region"", referring to the People’s Republic of China.
She told the Centre for Strategic and International Studies Chinese aircraft had increasingly engaged in unsafe intercepts of Australian aircraft in international airspace above the South China Sea and in three separate incidents in the last few months had challenged marine research and energy exploration activities within the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines.
Speaking later at the same event, Ely Ratner, assistant secretary of defence for Indo-Pacific Security Affairs, said there had been  “dozens” of incidents in the first half of the year involving the Chinese military in the South China Sea, a sharp increase over the past five years. “Beijing is systematically testing the limits of our collective resolve,” he said.
“In my view, this aggressive and irresponsible behavior represents one of the most significant threats to peace and stability in the region today, including in the South China Sea. And if the PLA continues this pattern of behavior, it is only a matter of time before there is a major incident or accident in the region,” he said, referring to China’s armed forces.
The comments came ahead of an anticipated call between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, which is expected to focus on ways to prevent the growing US-China strategic rivalry veering into conflict, particularly over the self-ruled Chinese-claimed island of Taiwan.

1,Russia plans to quit International Space Station ‘after 2024’,"Of course, we will fulfil all our obligations to our partners, chief of Moscow's space agency says.","MOSCOW: Russia has decided to quit the International Space Station  “after 2024”, the newly appointed chief of Moscow’s space agency told President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.
The announcement comes as tensions rage between the Kremlin and the West over Moscow’s military intervention in Ukraine and several rounds of unprecedented sanctions against Russia. Russia and the United States have worked side by side on the ISS, which has been in orbit since 1998.
“Of course, we will fulfil all our obligations to our partners, but the decision to leave this station after 2024 has been made,” Yury Borisov, who was appointed Roscosmos chief in mid-July, told Putin.
“I think that by this time we will start putting together a Russian orbital station,” Borisov added, calling it the space programme’s main  “priority”.
“Good,” Putin replied in comments released by the Kremlin.
Until now space exploration was one of the few areas where cooperation between Russia and the United States and its allies had not been wrecked by tensions over Ukraine and elsewhere. Borisov said the space industry was in a  “difficult situation”.
He said he would seek  “to raise the bar, and first of all, to provide the Russian economy with the necessary space services”, pointing to navigation, communication, and data transmission, among other things.
Sending the first man into space in 1961 and launching the first satellite four years earlier are among key accomplishments of the Soviet space programme and remain a major source of national pride in Russia.
But experts say the Russian space agency remains a shadow of its former self and has in recent years suffered a series of setbacks including corruption scandals and the loss of a number of satellites and other spacecraft.
Borisov, a former deputy prime minister with a military background, has replaced Dmitry Rogozin, a firebrand nationalist politician known for his bombastic statements and eccentric behaviour.

2,Thousands of cows buried at landfill after deadly heatwave in US,Kansas is forecast to see more high temperatures that can stress and potentially kill cattle this summer.,"CHICAGO: Top US cattle feeding companies sent 1,000-pound carcasses to a Kansas landfill, where they were flattened by loader machines and mixed with trash, after a June heatwave killed thousands of cows, documents show. Other cattle were buried in unlined graves, a feeding company said.
Neither is a typical method for disposing of bodies. But so many cows died in the unusual heat and humidity that facilities that normally convert carcasses into pet food and fertilizer products were overwhelmed, prompting the state government and cattle feeders to take emergency measures.
The mass deaths and subsequent scramble to deal with decaying bodies sparked a push for changes in the meat industry in Kansas, the third-largest US cattle state.
Kansas is forecast to see more high temperatures that can stress and potentially kill cattle this summer, adding to the myriad problems caused by increasingly extreme weather linked to climate change.
Although state officials authorised companies to dispose of carcasses at the Seward County Landfill in Liberal, Kansas, they are now considering alternatives to decrease the risks for foul smells and other problems if more deaths occur, the landfill’s director said.
The disposal methods and identities of companies that lost cattle have not previously been reported. They were contained in documents obtained from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and confirmed by some companies involved.
At least 2,117 cattle died after humidity levels spiked, winds disappeared and temperatures topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38C) in southwestern Kansas during the weekend of June 11, state records show. It was early in the year for such heat and before some cattle had fully shed their winter coats. Seward County Landfill Director Brock Theiner estimated the dump alone took in roughly 1,850 to 2,000 dead cattle. 
Landfill workers used loading equipment with steel wheels to flatten the cattle to about eight inches and mixed the bodies with garbage, a process that took nearly three weeks, Theiner said.
“After you run them over they’ll go flat, but they’re gonna sponge back up,” Theiner said.  “You get a mass of ‘em and you get on it, and it’s like running a piece of equipment on top of a water bed. It moves.”  Kansas temporarily suspended requirements that carcasses be covered by at least six inches (15.24 cm) of dirt or trash each day due to the unexpected deaths, Theiner said. The carcasses had a putrid smell up close, he added.
“Once you got in it, whew!” he said.  “I have a couple operators that have iron guts.”  Landfills are the last resort for carcasses because of complications with smells, animals digging in trash, and difficulties covering the bodies immediately, Theiner said. Kansas officials are exploring whether more cattle could be composted at feedlots instead, he said. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment did not respond to questions.

Unconfirmed reports of more than $75,000 collected at the dump at Las Parejas, in central Argentina, in recent days have piqued such frenetic interest that authorities have had to close the facility.  “A friend got out of his truck and saw a crisp $100 bill (note) on the ground. It struck us because it was in impeccable condition,” said Federico Baez, one of the greenback beneficiaries. 
“We each started to grab a share. It was like a game, to see who could grab the most bills. We got about $10,000 between the six of us,” Baez said. 
“Then another kid came along and found $25,000, he was luckier. I think there must be much more buried,” he added. 
It is not known whether the finders will be allowed to keep their loot.

4,Faster growth may help bacteria remove lake plastic waste,Microplastics have been found in virtually every corner of the globe.,"PARIS: Chemicals leaking from plastic waste make bacteria grow faster in European lakes, according to research published on Tuesday that authors said could provide a natural way to remove plastic pollution from freshwater ecosystems.
Microplastics have been found in virtually every corner of the globe — from the highest glaciers to the bottom of the deepest sea trench — but the impact of plastic pollution in lakes is less well researched than in oceans.
When plastic materials such as carrier bags break down in water, they release simple carbon compounds slightly different to those produced when organic matter such as twigs and leaves disintegrate.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge wanted to see what effect these compounds had on bacteria populations in 29 lakes across Scandinavia.
They cut up plastic bags from four major British shopping chains and mixed them with water until the carbon compounds were released.
They then filled glass bottles with water from each lake, mixing a small amount of the plastic water into half of these samples.

5,"US and Taliban make progress on Afghan reserves, but big gaps remain",KABUL: US and Taliban officials have exchanged proposals for the release of billions of dollars from Afghan central...,"KABUL: US and Taliban officials have exchanged proposals for the release of billions of dollars from Afghan central bank reserves held abroad into a trust fund, three sources familiar with the talks said, offering a hint of progress in efforts to ease Afghanistan’s economic crisis.
Significant differences between the sides remain, however, according to two of the sources, including the Taliban’s refusal to replace the bank’s top political appointees, one of whom is under US sanctions as are several of the movement’s leaders.
Some experts said such a move would help restore confidence in the institution by insulating it from interference by the Islamist militant group that seized power a year ago but which foreign governments do not recognise.
Freeing up cash may not solve all of Afghanistan’s financial troubles, but it would provide relief for a country hit by a slump in foreign aid, persistent drought and an earthquake in June that killed 1,000 people. Millions of Afghans are facing a second winter without enough to eat.
While the Taliban do not reject the concept of a trust fund, they oppose a US proposal for third-party control of the fund that would hold and disburse returned reserves, said a Taliban government source.
The United States has been in talks with Switzerland and other parties on the creation of a mechanism that would include the trust fund, disbursements from which would be decided with the help of an international board, according to a US source who also declined to be named in order to discuss the matter.
A possible model could be the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund, a World Bank-administered fund created to get donations of foreign development assistance to Kabul, the US source added.
“No agreement has been reached yet,” said Shah Mehrabi, an Afghan-American economics professor who is on the Afghan central bank’s supreme council.
The US State Department and Switzerland’s Federal Department of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. The Afghan central bank did not respond to requests for comment.
US Special Representative for Afghanistan Thomas West, speaking at an Afghanistan-focused conference in Uzbekistan on Tuesday, welcomed the dialogue.
“We have made it clear that a future recapitalisation of the (Afghanistan) central bank and the Afghan financial system is possible provided that reasonable and serious steps are taken to professionalise the central bank, to enhance its AML/CFT (anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing) architecture and its independence,” he said.
Some $9 billion in reserves have been held outside Afghanistan, including $7 billion in the United States, since the Taliban overran Kabul last August as US-led forces withdrew after 20 years of fighting the militants.
Foreign governments and rights groups have accused the Taliban of abuses including extrajudicial killings during and after the insurgency, and the movement has curtailed women’s freedoms since regaining power.
The international community wants the group to improve its record on women’s and other rights before officially recognising it.At talks in Doha last month, the Taliban submitted to US officials their response to the US proposal for a mechanism to free up Afghan assets, said Mehrabi, the Taliban official and a senior diplomat.
Experts cautioned that releasing funds would bring only temporary relief and new revenue streams were needed to replace direct foreign aid that financed 70 percent of the government budget before it was halted after the Taliban takeover.

6,"Israel unveils rare 1,900 year-old Roman-era coin","The coin features the zodiac sign Cancer below Luna and the era’s Roman emperor, Antoninus Pius, on the other side.","JERUSALEM: Israeli archaeologists on Tuesday displayed a rare and  “remarkably well preserved” Roman-era coin dating back nearly 1,900 years, depicting the moon goddess Luna, the first such find in Israeli waters.
The coin minted in Alexandria in present-day Egypt featuring the zodiac sign Cancer below Luna and the era’s Roman emperor, Antoninus Pius, on the other side, was discovered by archaeologists with the Israel Antiquities Authority during explorations off Haifa in northern Israel.
It is dated  “year eight”, referring to the eighth year of Antoninus Pius’s rule, which ran from 138 to 161, part of an era known as Pax Romana, when there was relative peace throughout the Roman Empire.
The coin is part of a series of 13 — specimens of which have been discovered elsewhere in the world — depicting the 12 signs of the zodiac and another the complete zodiac wheel, the IAA said.
“This is the first time such a coin has been discovered off Israel’s coast,” Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA’s marine archaeology unit, said in a statement.
“These finds, which were lost at sea and disappeared from sight for hundreds and thousands of years, have been remarkably well preserved; some are extremely rare and their discovery completes parts of the historical puzzle of the country’s past,” he added.
Sharvit said that the Luna piece was found among a  “small hoard” of other coins and the circumstances of the find indicated there had been a shipwreck nearby.

7,Israeli army razes homes of suspects in settler’s killing,"Says during the demolitions, ""hundreds of Palestinians instigated a number of violent riots"".","QARAWAT HASAN: Israeli forces on Tuesday demolished the homes of two Palestinians in the occupied West Bank accused of shooting dead a Jewish settler in April, an army statement said.
The army said it had destroyed the homes in Qarawat Bani Hasan, in the northern West Bank, belonging to Yusef Aasi and Yehya Miri, accused of perpetrating  “a deadly shooting attack at the entrance to the city of Ariel, murdering the Israeli security guard Vyacheslav Golev”.
Aasi and Miri were arrested a day after the April 29 attack and are being held by Israel.
They have not yet faced trial in Israeli military court, which exercises jurisdiction over offences committed by Palestinians in parts of the West Bank, a territory occupied by the Jewish state since 1967.
“The demolition took place after the petition from the terrorists’ families was rejected by the Supreme Court,” the army statement said.
The army added that during the demolitions,  “hundreds of Palestinians instigated a number of violent riots. The rioters hurled rocks, Molotov cocktails and burning tyres at the soldiers. The forces responded with riot dispersal means.” Golev was killed during a period of surging tensions in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including regular clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces at Jerusalem’s flashpoint Al Aqsa mosque compound at the end of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.
Human rights activists say Israel’s policy of demolishing the homes of suspected attackers amounts to collective punishment, as it can render non-combatants, including children, homeless. But Israel says the practice is effective in deterring some Palestinians from carrying out attacks.
Roughly 475,000 Jewish settlers now live in the West Bank in communities widely regarded as illegal under international law. Ariel, where Golev was killed, is one of the largest settler communities.

8,"Morocco, Israel sign judicial accord to expand cooperation",RABAT: Morocco and Israel added legal links to a growing list of cooperation accords since they normalised relations...,"RABAT: Morocco and Israel added legal links to a growing list of cooperation accords since they normalised relations in 2020, during a visit Tuesday by Israeli Justice Minister Gideon Saar.
He signed a judicial accord in Rabat with his Moroccan counterpart Abdellatif Ouahbi.
A joint statement said the two countries would share expertise and modernise their judicial systems through digitalisation, while cooperating in the fight against organised crime, terrorism and human trafficking.
Also on Tuesday, Israel’s Regional Cooperation Minister Issawi Frej, an Israeli Arab whose family originated in Morocco, held talks in Rabat on a cultural exchange programme for youths from both countries.
Morocco cut relations with Israel in 2000 following the outbreak of the second Palestinian intifada, but re-established ties two decades later in a deal that saw Washington recognise Rabat’s sovereignty over the disputed Western Sahara.
Since then, a steady stream of Moroccan and Israeli officials have visited each others’ countries and signed deals ranging from defence and security to the economy, culture and sports.
Israeli army chief Aviv Kohavi visited Morocco last week, consolidating the strategic and military alliance between the Jewish state and the North African country.

9,EU agrees to curb gas use as Russia squeezes supply,"Hungary is the only country that opposed the deal, say EU officials...","BRUSSELS: European Union countries approved a weakened emergency plan to curb their gas demand, after striking compromise deals to limit the cuts for some countries, as they brace for further Russian reductions in supply.
Europe faces an increased gas squeeze from Wedne­sday, when Russian’s Gazp­rom has said it would cut flows through the Nord Stre­­am 1 pipeline to Germany to a fifth of capacity.
With a dozen EU countries already facing reduced Russian supplies, Brussels is urging member states to save gas and store it for winter for fear Russia will completely cut off flows in retaliation for Western sanctions over its war with Ukraine.
Energy ministers approved a proposal for all EU countries to voluntarily cut gas use by 15 per cent.

Hungary is the only country that opposed the deal, say EU officials

The cuts could be made binding in a supply emergency, but countries agreed to exempt numerous countries and industries, after some governments had resisted the EU’s original proposal to impose a binding 15pc cut on every country.
German Economy Minis­ter Robert Habeck said the agreement would show Russian President Vlad­imir Putin that Europe remained united in the face of Moscow’s latest gas cuts.
“You will not split us,” Habeck said.
Hungary was the only country that opposed the deal, two EU officials said.
Russia’s Gazprom has blamed its latest reduction on needing to halt the operation of a turbine — a reason dismissed by EU energy chief Kadri Simson, who called the move “politically motivated”.
Russia, which supplied 40pc of EU gas before it invaded Ukraine, has said it is a reliable energy supplier.

10,"Slain Palestinian journalist’s family in US, seeks probe",Press US for an independent probe and accountability from Israel on a visit to Washington.,"WASHINGTON: The family of slain Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh on Tuesday pressed the United States for an independent probe and accountability from Israel on a visit to Washington at the invitation of Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
The family, which is also meeting lawmakers, said it was calling for the United States to launch its own  “thorough, credible independent and transparent investigation” into Abu Akleh’s murder.
“For far too long, the United States has enabled Israel to kill with impunity by providing weapons, immunity, and diplomatic cover,” Shireen’s brother Tony Abu Akleh and her niece and nephew said in a statement.
“Impunity leads to repetition. We are here to do our part to ensure that this cycle ends,” they said.
“If we allow Shireen’s killing to be swept under the rug, we send a message that the lives of US citizens abroad don’t matter, that the lives of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation don’t matter, and that the most courageous journalists in the world, those who cover the human impact of armed conflict and violence, are expendable.” Shireen Abu Akleh, an Al Jazeera journalist and a prominent Palestinian reporter, was killed on May 11 as she covered an Israeli operation in the West Bank.
The United States on July 4 released a statement saying she was likely shot by Israeli fire but that there was no evidence her killing was intentional and that the bullet was too damaged for a conclusive finding.
The statement outraged Abu Akleh’s family and Palestinian leaders who say that the United States is not seeking accountability from Israel over the death of the journalist, who also held US citizenship. Israel says it is still probing her death and rejects suggestions it targeted a journalist.
Abu Akleh’s family unsuccessfully sought to meet President Joe Biden when he visited Israel and the West Bank earlier this month.
Blinken, however, invited the family to visit Wash­ington, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said during the trip.
Blinken had spoken earlier to her family by phone and publicly criticised Israel for using force at her funeral, when police grabbedPalestinian flags and pallbearers struggled not to drop her casket.
