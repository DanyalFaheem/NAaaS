0,Pressure on rupee to ‘vanish’ soon: Miftah,"Says inflows of dollars into Pakistan will soon be higher than the outflow, resulting in a stable exchange rate.","KARACHI: Finance Minister Miftah Ismail said on Tuesday the pressure on the rupee will “vanish” in a couple of weeks.
In a one-on-one conversation with Mosharraf Zaidi, CEO of advisory services firm Tabadlab, Mr Ismail said the inflows of dollars into Pakistan will soon be higher than the outflow, resulting in a stable exchange rate.
“Nobody is happy with surgery, but sometimes it’s necessary,” he said while defending his policy of import curtailment to reduce the dollar outflow — a measure that may slow down economic growth and reduce tax collection at the import stage.



 
He repeatedly insisted that the fears of a sovereign default were overblown and that the policymakers knew “all the balls that (they) have in the air” i.e. expected inflows of the foreign currency in the next quarter or so.
“This is what I’m trying to do: moderate our purchases (imports) and not slow down our exports. For two to three months, I’m going to do that. (With every passing) week, I have a greater handle on the foreign currency,” he said.
The country burned $80 billion last year to buy foreign goods and services while earning only $31bn against its exports. The resulting gap in dollar liquidity has put pressure on the rupee’s value, which has been depreciating against the greenback.
The rupee lost 1.31 per cent value against the dollar on Tuesday to close at 232.93 in the interbank market. By the end of last week, the local currency had lost 22.7pc since Jan 1 and 10.3pc since July 1.
Mr Ismail said a policy plan will soon be in place. Imports will go down gradually and exports will be up “organically” within three months, he said.
“It’s no fun going to the world, to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to the Chinese, to the Saudis, asking for money,” he said.
He said IMF inflows will materialise within weeks as there’s no chance of the Washington-based lender reopening the loan negotiations. “There’s no prior action that’s left really. The only thing is that they have a vacation for the (IMF) directors from Aug 1 to Aug 15. That’s why the meeting is a little later than I would’ve liked.”
Mr Ismail defended the idea of raising dollars by letting a “friendly country” acquire 10-15pc shareholding in state-owned companies with tradeable shares on the stock exchange. He blamed “irresponsible politicians” for scandalising a simple repurchase or repo arrangement that’ll bring in the much-needed dollars in the immediate term to fight the balance-of-payments crisis.
The government first requested the unnamed friendly country for dollar-denominated deposits to shore up foreign exchange reserves. But it turned down Islamabad’s request, saying the latter never returned the deposits, the finance minister said.
Subsequently, the friendly country showed willingness to buy shares in listed government-owned entities under a buyback agreement, which will give Islamabad the option — but not the obligation — to repurchase the same shareholding after a certain period of time at a 5pc higher rate.
“There’s not even (a question of) price discovery,” he said, noting that the friendly country “wants to helps us” and is giving Pakistan “a good deal”.

1,Parts shortage forces Suzuki to cut production days in August,"""We are trying to deliver all vehicles that were booked till June,"" company's public relations head says.","KARACHI: Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL) has decided to cut the number of production days in August due to shortage of parts following restrictions on their import imposed by the State Bank of Pakistan. 
When contacted, PSMCL public relations head Shafiq Ahmed Shaikh said the company had already stopped booking of vehicles from July 1 due to an expected reduction in the number of production days in August. 
Without giving any specific dates of non-production days (NPDs) next month, he said currently commercial banks were not opening letters of credit for completely knocked down (CKD) kits. Unavailability of CKD kits and related raw materials may result in plant shutdown next month, he added. 
Mr Shaikh said there would be big problems in August if the same situation persisted and resuming the booking of vehicles would depend on normalisation of LCs opening. He said the State Bank’s restrictions on opening LCs had affected clearance of import consignments from the port. 
He said Pak Suzuki had continued production in July this year by adjusting production plans. “We are trying to deliver all vehicles that were booked till June.” 

Company has already stopped booking of vehicles this month

Pak Suzuki had sold 150,279 units during the outgoing fiscal year (FY22) compared to 88,032 units in FY21, showing a jump of 71pc. Sales in June hit 16,009 units compared to 12,212 units in May. 
Parts maker/exporter and director of Mehran Commercial Mashood Ali Khan urged the auto assemblers to announce NPDs simultaneously so that parts manufacturers could also make plans accordingly. He said parts makers were facing problems in meeting their overheads and expenses due to the gap in announcement of NPDs by the car assemblers. 
Mr Mashood said the government should focus on resolving the economic crisis caused by the uncertain exchange rate rather than handling political issues, adding that it should form a team of economic experts that could plan strategies to solve the problems being faced by the country’s trade and industry. 
Indus Motor Company also kept its production shut for two weeks in July and planned NPDs for the first two weeks of next month. 
The makers of Kia vehicles also opted for three to four days of NPDs in July, besides closing down the plant on Saturdays. 
Despite tightening of auto financing by the State Bank from the third quarter of 2021 and further curbs in the last few months, auto financing increased to Rs368 billion in June this year, depicting a jump of 19.4pc year-on-year and 0.32pc month-on-month due to the orders made a few months back.

2,IMF cuts global growth outlook,"""The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession,"" says IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas.","WASHINGTON: Surging inflation and severe slowdowns in the United States and China prompted the IMF on Tuesday to downgrade its outlook for the global economy this year and next, while warning that the situation could get much worse. 
“The outlook has darkened significantly since April,” said IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas. “The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one. The world’s three largest economies, the United States, China and the euro area are stalling with important consequences for the global outlook,” he said at a briefing. 
In its latest World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund cut the 2022 global GDP estimate to 3.2 per cent, four-tenths of a point lower than the April forecast, and about half the rate seen last year. 
Last year’s “tentative recovery” from the pandemic downturn “has been followed by increasingly gloomy developments in 2022 as risks began to materialise,” the report said. 
“Several shocks have hit a world economy already weakened by the pandemic,” including the war in Ukraine which has driven up global prices for food and energy, prompting central banks to raise interest rates sharply, the IMF said. Ongoing Covid-19 lockdowns and a worsening real estate crisis have hindered economic activity in China, while the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes are slowing US growth sharply. 
But the IMF offered a stark caveat to the forecasts, cautioning that “risks to the outlook are overwhelmingly tilted to the downside,” and if they materialise could push the global economy into one of the worst slumps in the past half-century. 
Key among the concerns is the fallout from the war in Ukraine including the potential for Russia to cut off natural gas supplies to Europe, as well as a further spike in prices and a food shortage due to the chokehold the war has on grain supplies that could trigger famine. 
In an ominous warning, the WEO said “such shocks could, if sufficiently severe, cause a combination of recession accompanied by high and rising inflation (‘stagflation’)”. That would slam the brakes on growth, slowing it to 2.0pc in 2023. 
While the global economy did a bit better than expected in the first three months of the year, it appears to have “shrunk in the second quarter — the first contraction since 2020”, the IMF said. 
The IMF downgraded growth forecasts for most countries, including big revisions for the United States and China, cutting more than a point off the prior forecasts.

3,Banking spread for housing scheme revised,Banking spread on housing finance for Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar scheme revised from 400 basis points to 250 basis points.,"KARACHI: The government has revised the banking spread on housing finance for the Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar (MPMG) scheme from 400 basis points to 250 basis points over and above the prevailing Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (Kibor).
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issued a circular on Tuesday that said the government is reviewing the housing scheme, which offers subsidies on financing. The main reason for the move appears to be that the interest rate has gone up to 15 per cent while the spread was 4pc for banks.
The SBP said the government has decided to allow banks/development financial institutions/microfinance banks to disburse financing as per the existing terms of MPMG in respect of cases approved and meeting any of the following conditions on or before June 30.
Approved cases (purchase and construction) pending for disbursement due to any legal formality. All pre-disbursement formalities have been done and the bank has communicated the same (being in adv­ance stages, these customers have completed almost all pre-disbursement formalities, paid token money and incurred all incidental exp­e­n­ses). This refers to Benchmark 1 aga­inst which the SBP solicited data from banks on July 7.
Further, approved cases where customers have entered into agreements, paid token money and obtained property documents from sellers or in case of construction loans have already been issued. These cases are just short of “approved cases pending for disbursement” (Benchmark 1), as in such cases, a few internal procedures of banks may still be required to be completed but the borrowers have incurred all major costs or expenses based on approvals from banks). This refers to Benchmark 2 against which the SBP solicited data from banks on July 7.
The banks/development financial institutions/microfinance banks were advised by the SBP to ensure that markup subsidy claims in respect of disbursements against above allowed customers are invariably accompanied by certificates of their respective internal audit departments verifying meticulous compliance with above conditions and other features of the MPMG. The SBP will also conduct inspection of these cases during regular/special inspection of the banks/development financial institutions/microfinance banks.
“The government has decided that (the) spread of banks and development financial institutions on the disbursements against cases mentioned above and falling under Tiers 2 and 3 of the MPMG will be a maximum of 250 basis points over and above Kibor (instead of the maximum allowed spread of 400 basis points currently allowed),” said the SBP.
The government has been in the process of withdrawing all kinds of subsidies to get loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF was critical of the subsidies on the prices of petroleum products and electricity.
The previous government offered a number of subsidies to the housing sector, which pushed up economic activities. However, the IMF believes it was not sustainable.

4,Govt urged to fix textile exporters’ liquidity crunch,"Pakistan Textile Exporters Association delegation meets finance minister, informs him about issues the industry is facing.","ISLAMABAD: Textile exporters met Finance Minister Miftah Ismail on Tuesday and informed him about the challenges they are facing related to income tax, sales tax refunds, deferred payment claims and exchange rates, and asked the government to address these issues, a leading industrialist told Dawn. 
They complained that the tax machinery had withheld exporters’ refunds to show a rise in the overall revenue collection and there were delays in the availability of subsidised loans on already approved projects. 
A delegation of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association (PTEA), led by its chairman Shaiq Jawed, met Mr Ismail. The association’s patron-in-chief, Khurram Mukhtar, told Dawn after the meeting the delegation apprised the finance minister about three major issues: uninterrupted supply of energy to the textile sector round the year, release of refunds and a road map for clearing provincial sales tax refunds.
He said the minister was requested to set up a separate desk to process different refund claims with a deadline. The textile sector’s pending refunds stood at Rs35 billion on account of sales tax and Rs30bn in income tax. The tax credit amount of the textile sector is around Rs20bn.

PTEA delegation meets finance minister, informs him about issues facing the industry

Punjab and Sindh also owe Rs15bn as provincial sales tax refunds to exporters. The provincial refunds have been pending since 2013.
The minister was informed that loans under Temporary Economic Refinance Facility (TERF) and Long-Term Financing Facility (LTTF) schemes had already been approved by commercial banks but were not being granted at the moment. “This is putting all new investment at risk,” the minister was informed. 
Mr Mukhtar said the State Bank governor had assured to look into the demands and would honour the past commitments.
The pending Duty Drawback of Taxes (DDT) refunds stood at Rs30bn, while another refund of Rs5bn under the head of technology upgradation fund (TUF) and another Rs0.5bn under the social contribution are also pending. “We have requested the finance minister for early release of these funds to address the liquidity crunch faced by the industry,” he said.
An official announcement of the finance ministry said Mr Ismail presided over the meeting with the PTEA delegation at the finance division.
The minister stressed that the present government was providing a conducive and friendly environment to the business community and assured the delegation that concrete steps were being taken to build up their confidence. 
He directed the relevant authorities to take the required steps for resolving the industry’s concerns.

5,Rupee unable to resist high tide of dollar demand,KARACHI: The rupee again lost its value against the US dollar on Tuesday in the interbank market leaving no chance ...,"KARACHI: The rupee again lost its value against the US dollar on Tuesday in the interbank market leaving no chance to survive against the high tide of dollar demand.
The State Bank reported the closing price of dollar at Rs232.93 in the interbank market as the greenback gained Rs3.05 on Tuesday. Since the inception of new government in Islamabad in the beginning of second week of April, the dollar appreciated by 28 per cent or Rs51 per dollar.
The importers are unable to arrange dollars for imports while State Bank is unable to improve its foreign exchange reserves still below double digit.
Currency dealers said that currently the political uncertainty is more critical than economic performance. The uncertainty in the currency market is a reflection of political situation of the country.
So far the government could not arrange dollars to continue foreign paym­e­nts like debt servicing and strengthen exchange rate. The deal with IMF is still not clear for the market.
The finance minister used to claim every second day that the deal with the IMF is about to be signed.

All-Sindh Saraf and Jewellers Association (ASSJA) President  Haji Haroon Rasheed Chand said the world bullion rate had plunged by $12 per ounce to $1,718 but the plunging rupee against the dollar continued to put pressure on fixing local rates at higher levels.
He claimed that gold in Pakistan is cheaper by Rs2,500 per tola than Dubai. On investment in gold and dollars, he said that investors are more interested in dollars while their second option is gold as both have been showing robust growth in their value.
