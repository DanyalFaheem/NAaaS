5,Another Punjab IGP in for ‘unceremonious exit’,Reshuffle will be made in light of SC verdict on Punjab chief minister elections.,"LAHORE: Following the Supreme Court decision about Hamza Shahbaz’s election as the Punjab chief minister, newly-appointed IGP Faisal Shahkar will be the immediate ‘victim’ as the apex court, in its 11-page verdict, has declared all appointments made by PML-N leader Hamza “null and void”.  
Mr Shahkar will be an ‘unlucky police officer’ who has served as IGP for the shortest period of 24 hours only as he had assumed charge of his new office on July 25.  
Some senior police officers say it is the worst time for the largest police force of the country, saying uncertainty has gripped the police officers since the political instability hit Punjab due to litigations. 
The regional and district police officers are feeling themselves insecure due to the political crisis and many of them have stopped taking interest due to uncertainty, they say.  

Reshuffle will be made in light of SC verdict

“An elite power struggle and a battle between two leading political parties to grab the chief minister slot has seriously affected the provincial police affairs,” a senior police official commented. 
He said that from amongst over 40 departments, it were the police who bear the brunt of regime change.
Following Tuesday’s verdict of the three-member bench of the Supreme Court, he said, the next government of the PTI in Punjab would immediately bring the police officers of its choice. “And appointment of new IGP would be its first step,” the police official said.  
Faisal Shahkar was appointed by the PML-N as new IGP on July 24 when Rao Sardar Ali Khan refused to serve as provincial police chief “due to the derogatory remarks passed by some PTI leaders against him”.  
The new Punjab chief minister would make appointment of new provincial police chief, RPOs and DPOs of the province, he said, adding that another massive reshuffle in the largest police force of the country would surely deepen the crisis in the police department.

The PPSC e-payment system has been developed in collaboration with the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB).
Previously, the PPSC fee payment was restricted to the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) only and the candidates used to face difficulty while submitting the fees manually for which they had to be in long queues outside the bank.
To save the candidates from hassle, the PPSC is going to introduce a one-click payment system. To avail the facility the candidates will have to fill the online form by inserting their personal information, generating a 17-digit PSID code. They will use the PSID code to pay fees through ATMs, internet banking and mobile phone banking or over the counter (by visiting One-Link banks).
Applicants will also be able to deposit the fees using Jazz Cash, Easy Paisa, U-paisa etc. 
On payment of the amount, they will receive a confirmatory SMS and an email from the PPSC.
After getting the SMS candidate will again visit the webpage and will further be directed to the next step of the application process.  
Without the fees payment, a candidate will not be able to process his/her application.  
After the launch of the e-payment system, PPSC will not accept 32-A fee challan forms.
The e-payment will also help in automatic receipt verification, eliminating fake candidates.
It will be a 24/7 facility introduced to facilitate candidates in hassle-free fee submission.

In a statement issued here on Tuesday, he said this kind of politics had existed forever, but its secrets had been exposed to the public for the first time and suggested that someone should write a doctorate thesis on the political ups and downs of the last few months.
Qadri said the political happenings of the last four months were not seen or heard in any other country before, and added that with a little effort, some of the events could become part of the Guinness Book of World Records.
In societies where the weak, the oppressed and the innocent are subjected to the stick of injustice, sometimes even the powerful groan with the pain of not getting justice, he said while referring to the incumbent rulers’ worries.
He said that in the past only the one who was hit by the stick would feel the pain, but this time it was being felt by all for the first time.
“We alone had felt the pain of the Model Town tragedy as none had shared our feelings during the last eight years.”
Referring to the demand by the ruling coalition for the formation of a larger bench in the Punjab chief minister’s election case, he said that two or three judges are enough for justice in the biggest case and recalled that a larger bench of the Lahore High Court has been hearing for two years the case regarding stay orders of the JIT set up to investigate the Model Town tragedy, while the victims have been desperately seeking justice.
Dr Qadri requested the chief justice of Pakistan to feel the pain of the martyrs of Model Town and open the way for justice for them.

Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, he termed the grand dialogue the only option left to bring Pakistan out of prevailing crises and the JI was ready to host the negotiations if the political parties were willing. 
The ruling parties, Mr Haq said, had already converted the parliament into a rubber-stamp body while one of them was criticising the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). 
It was for the first time in history that political leaders and workers were openly attacking the judges of the supreme court, he said and the situation had reached the point where every institution was made controversial. 
“Don’t drag the judiciary into political conflicts,” he suggested to the politicians, asking them to show maturity and come to the table to settle their disputes. In case of politicians’ failure, he warned, the country could face an irreparable loss. 
The JI leader also criticised three ruling parties for seeking the establishment’s support time and again to remain in power, saying the latter also came under severe criticism for not keeping its neutrality intact defined in the Constitution of Pakistan. 
The role of the establishment, he said, was being questioned frequently, particularly after the 2018 election. The PTI, he added, had failed to deliver in three-and-a-half years and now the alliance government of the PDM and the PPP was also following the past policies, ignoring the masses who were under constant burden of inflation and facing hours long loadshedding. Hundreds died and thousands of houses washed away in rains and floods in parts of the country but the rulers had abandoned the poor. 
To a question, Sirajul Haq said elections without reforms would prove a futile exercise in the prevailing situation.  
“No one would be ready to accept the polls’ results if held without agreement of political players on election process.”  
He said the JI wanted polls under the principle of proportional representation and it was the only way to get rid of the politics of electable. 
He said the institutions and politicians should surrender before the Constitution.  
JI Deputy Secretary General Muhammad Asghar and Information Secretary Qaisar Sharif were also present.

As per the estimate of district administration, 56 mauzas in the district have so far been affected by the flood and 120,457 acres of land has been inundated by the flood water while a total 11,884 acres of cultivated land was destroyed.  
Talking to Dawn, Rajanpur Deputy Commissioner Jameel Ahmed said negligence of the irrigation department played the main role in the devastation caused by the breaches as protection dykes were weak and unattended during the continuous heavy rains. He said the Qutab drain was constructed under a project and linked with water channels having weak unattended embankments.   
He added that the flood situation was not alarming yet as per record of the irrigation department mountain drains. Alarmed at 19 breaches in the protection dykes, including eight breaches within distance of 10km, the DC said officially had been written to the authorities concerned to declare Rajanpur a calamity-hit area and hold a probe into the charges against the irrigation department officials. He said that despite continuous official requests to the irrigation department, neither dykes were strengthened nor did the flood department play its proper role in plugging breaches. 

DG Khan schools turned into relief camps, wheat stocks damaged

Mr Ahmed said the district administration plugged the breaches with the help of the locals. He said even the irrigation department had no appropriate machinery and plans to cope with floods coming from the mountain drains. He said it was strange that the canals were still flowing instead during flood and continuous rains and the irrigation department had not closed them. 
Meanwhile, the Dera Ghazi Khan district administration announced converting all the schools in flood-hit areas into relief camps.  
The education, revenue and other departments issued orders to complete arrangements on an emergency basis. The flood victims have been instructed to move to the relief camp. 
A cut was made in Manka Canal near Basti Malinga and Basti Gul Muhammad Chandia under the supervision of Dera Ghazi Khan DC Muhammad Anwar Briar to save the population.  
In a video message to the flood victims, the DC said relief camps had been established in the affected areas of mountain drain Vidoor and Suri Lind. The damages of the flood victims would be remedied after a survey, he announced.  
On the other hand, a heavy stock of wheat of the food department in the Shadan Lound has been badly damaged by the flood after a breach in the Shadan Lound protection dyke. The DC said a report on the damage to the wheat stock had been sent to the authorities.

Journalist Malik Sajid Sipra, a resident of Qasba Gujrat, said he contacted the officials concerned to draw their attention towards the issue but he had yet to get any response. He said if the drain water would not be released, it could be potentially a medium level flood which would damage houses and crops.
