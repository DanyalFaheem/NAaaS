He said: “Pak-US cooperation during Covid-19 pandemic clearly demonstrated that a robust Pak-US partnership in the health sector could prove a bulwark against pandemic and diseases thus saving millions of precious human lives.”
“Disease knows no boundaries. A pandemic will not only be a challenge for a particular country but the region and beyond,” Mr Patel said.
Highlighting Pakistan’s efforts towards polio eradication, he stressed that a holistic approach comprising immunisation, and mother and child nutrition was critical to the success of polio eradication efforts.

2,Petition challenging ad hoc judge’s appointment in AJK SC dismissed,MUZAFFARABAD: A writ petition challenging the appointment of an ad hoc judge in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK)...,"MUZAFFARABAD: A writ petition challenging the appointment of an ad hoc judge in the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Supreme Court was dismissed by the territory’s high court in limine while holding that it was the prerogative of the AJK chief justice to determine the necessity of ad hoc judge for which he was not answerable before any authority. 
Barrister Sardar Adnan Nawaz had on Friday challenged the appointment of Younas Tahir as ad hoc judge of apex court made in Nov 2021 “till the pleasure of the CJ” for being “in violation of the mandatory provisions of the Constitution”.
Barrister Nawaz had contended that an ad hoc judge could be appointed for a specific period and for specific cases but the impugned notification did not provide any information, whatsoever, about the specific cases which the permanent judges could not decide owing to any legal infirmity.
According to him, the service of a judge could not be contingent with the “pleasure of the CJ” as it risked the independence of judiciary and raised questions about the impartiality of the ad-hoc judge concerned.
Dismissing his contentions, the HC bench comprising Chief Justice Sadaqat Hussain Raja, Justice Mian Arif Hussain and Justice Sardar Liaqat Hussain maintained that after the 13th amendment the ad hoc judge had been included in the definition of a judge with the same powers and jurisdiction as that of a permanent judge.
Regarding the specific duration of an ad hoc judge, the bench held that it was specifically employed in the Constitution that the ad hoc judge shall continue keeping in view the necessity of the position.
Of word “pleasure” used in the impugned notification, the bench maintained that it had to be read in light of furtherance of the word “necessity” appearing in the Constitution.
“In our view, the ‘pleasure’ of the CJ is a power to decide the necessity of an ad hoc judge on individualised evaluation guided by the Constitution, law and rules.”
It declared the petition “meritless” and dismissed it in limine.

5,CDA simplifies property transfer procedure,ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Wednesday said it had eased property transfer and other...,"ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Wednesday said it had eased property transfer and other procedures to facilitate citizens.
“Unnecessary requirements have been abolished so that property-related matters could be disposed swiftly,” said the civic agency in a press release.
It said initially the printing of transfer letters of sectors dealt by Estate Management-I had been centralised. From August 1, the assistant director admitting One-Window Operation Directorate, after admitting the case, shall take print of the transfer letter, sign, stamp and emboss it and hand it over to the transferee the same day.
The press release said instructions had been issued to the Directorate of Information Technology to ensure all arrangements by August 1. The CDA said initially the process of issuing transfer letters in all sectors being dealt by Estate Management-I has been centralised after which the process of issuing transfer letters of properties in sectors dealt by the Estate Affectees Section will be centralised.
Similarly, the condition of obtaining NOC from the Building Control Section for the process of transfer of properties to legal heirs under the inheritance law has been replaced with an undertaking.
The legal heirs will now submit an undertaking to the CDA that they will be bound to remove any illegal structure after completion of the legal heirship process. In this regard, the prescribed processing fee of the Building Control Section has to be deposited as per practice.
Under this process, Estate Management-I, State Management-II and Estate Affectees Section on receipt of application/legal documentation for legal heirship will forward the case for obtaining reports from Building Control Directorate to ascertain the violation of Building Control Regulations. In case of violation of Building Control Regulations, the legal heirs shall submit an affidavit to the CDA that they will remove the violation within six months. But the property transferred to the legal heirs could not be transferred further until the violation of the Building Control Regulations 2020 is eliminated.
If a property falls under the category of non-conferring use, the non-conferring use must be terminated before it is transferred to the legal heirs.
Similarly, the period for issuance of No-Demand Certificate (NDC) by Estate Management-I and Estate Management-II has also been reduced to four days.  In this regard, instructions have been issued to complete the process within four days after submission of application.
In case of any legal complication, the allottee or the applicant will be informed on time as to why the NDC was not being issued on their request.
These initiatives were approved by the CDA board a couple of months ago and, in accordance with the decision, the civic agency is all set to introduce them from August 1.

After approval of the MCI administrator, Irfan Nawaz Memon, who is also the deputy commissioner, the DMA on Tuesday notified the three-member committee which will be headed by Director Administration Ghulam Shabbir.
The committee has been tasked with looking into five audit paras, which were pointed out during special audit in 2019-21.
“The committee is requested to probe the matter within three weeks enabling this office for submission of reply to the audit paras of special audit to the director audit CDA,” read the notification.
The committee will probe para 2, 3,5,6 and 10 of the special audit report. According to the audit report, para 2 was related to non-maintenance of record for parking fee of the parking lot adjacent to Centaurus Mall, Shakarparian and Daman-i-Koh.

Non-maintenance of record of parking fee for space adjacent to Centaurus, in Shakarparian, Daman-i-Koh among alleged irregularities

Para 3 is related to irregular/doubtful expenditure on account of salaries of the fee collection staff and other miscellaneous charges in the parking sites.
Similarly, para 5 had pointed out irregular expenditure of Rs28.949 million incurred at the site of Diplomatic Shuttle Service while para 6 is about less recovery (Rs77.635 million) on account of fee from the shuttle service. Para 10 is related to non-recovery of rent of 19 kiosks at the G-9 bus stand and two kiosks at Centaurus Mall parking.
During the special audit, the audit teams had pointed out irregularities and alleged corruption, including less recovery from Diplomatic Shuttle Service and G-9 bus stand, and made 12 audit paras. However, an inquiry was ordered against six paras.
When contacted, the DMA director said action was being taken against all 12 paras and an inquiry was ordered against those six paras against which there was no serious reply.
The audit was conducted by a special team of the CDA headed by audit officer Rao Shahid Pervez. The team was tasked with carrying out the special audit of the last two years of car parking in Shakarparian and Daman-i-Koh, at a space adjacent to Centaurus and Diplomatic Bus Shuttle Service.
The CDA had ordered the special audit of these projects over reports of alleged corruption after the relevant officials, instead of auctioning them, opted for the self-collection system.
At Centaurus, Shakarparian and Daman-i-Koh car parking and the G-9 bus terminal, the municipal officers did self-collection and resorted to alleged corruption.
The special audit team after pointing out wrongdoings in March this year had recommended the initiation of inquiries to fix responsibility against the officials.
The audit report available with Dawn showed that parking ticket books were gotten printed from a local market and were not taken on stock nor numbers mentioned on it.
The auditors said due to the market-printed books, it was difficult for them to check the daily collection of parking fee and its remittance to the CDA and the MCI. They said the books were gotten printed without the approval of the competent authority.
“The maintenance of a stock register of ticket books is the basic requirement to check the parking fee receipt without which the exact collection could not be ascertained. In view of the above, the DMA administration may justify this serious financial irregularity which required investigation at an appropriate level,” the audit report said.
“Details of receipts and expenditure are not available/maintained. No record regarding payment of salaries and other expenditure was maintained and all expenditure incurred without approval of the competent authority. The payment of parking sites expenditure direct from the parking receipts is irregular and doubtful. This is a serious financial irregularity which shows loose financial discipline in DMA which requires proper justification,” the report said.
It said a previous contractor of Centaurus car parking had to pay Rs30 million but not a single notice was issued to him by the DMA for the recovery of the amount. After the DMA took over possession of parking sites and the bus terminal, the recovery of parking fee decreased abnormally compared to the bid of the contractor.
