Babar single-handedly took the tourists to just four runs short of Sri Lanka’s 222 as he put on a 70-run tenth-wicket stand with Naseem Shah, who made five not out from 52 balls, in Galle.
Sri Lanka were 36 for one at stumps after skipper Dimuth Karunaratne fell lbw to left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz, for 16.
Oshada Fernando, on 17, and nightwatchman Kasun Rajitha, on three, were batting when bad light stopped play for the day with the hosts leading by 40 runs in their second innings.
Jayasuriya was Sri Lanka’s go-to spinner as he claimed his third successive haul of five wickets or more to rattle the opposition batting, which slumped to 85-7 before lunch and then 148-9 in the second session.
But Babar kept up the fight and reached his seventh Test century with a four and single off mystery spinner Maheesh Theekshana as he jumped to celebrate. 
“I have not seen an innings like that for a long time,” batting coach Mohammad Yousuf said of Babar’s knock. 
“To be under so much pressure and the ball turning a lot, he played with a lot of patience and took the tailenders along. 
“A knock with so much patience, on a difficult track and especially the way he handled Jayasuriya. I am speechless.” 
Theekshana, who took two wickets, finally got the star batter trapped lbw to end the Pakistan innings on 218 in the final session.
Babar got help from the lower-order batsmen including Yasir Shah (18), Hasan Ali (17) and Naseem, as Pakistan managed 133 runs from the final three wickets.
Babar, who began the day on one, shielded number 11 Naseem by facing most of the balls in a defiant show of batting.
He hit fast bowler Rajitha for three straight boundaries and later a six and four off Theekshana and Jayasuriya.
For Sri Lanka it was a taste of their own medicine after they had fought back from 133-8 on day one, when Pakistan left-arm quick Shaheen Shah Afridi took four wickets.
Sri Lanka coach Chris Silverwood said the game was “evenly poised”. 
“Both teams have showed good signs and I am sure both at certain points would be frustrated,” he said. 
“Every run tomorrow is gold dust really,” he added. 
“This wicket going to start turning more and more as the game goes on, so every run that will get us in front is very important. It’s about smart and sensible cricket.” 
Pakistan resumed the day on 24 for two when play started 30 minutes late because of rain and Azhar Ali could only survive three balls before he was trapped lbw by Jayasuriya.
Debutant Salman Ali Agha’s stay lasted just 15 balls before he was out leg before to another sliding delivery from Jayasuriya having scored five.
Jayasuriya, 30, then struck on successive deliveries to remove Nawaz and Shaheen before Yasir survived the hat-trick ball.
Jayasuriya, who took 12 wickets on debut in a series-levelling Test win over Australia last week at the same venue, six in each innings, became the first Sri Lankan bowler and eighth overall to claim three five-wicket hauls in his first two Tests.

1,Second Test shifted from Colombo,GALLE: Sri Lanka on Sunday moved the second Test against Pakistan from Colombo to Galle due to political unrest in...,"GALLE: Sri Lanka on Sunday moved the second Test against Pakistan from Colombo to Galle due to political unrest in the island nation that forced its president to resign.
The Galle International Stadium will host its fourth straight Test in the past few weeks after the two Australia matches and the ongoing Pakistan opener. 
“SLC arrived at this decision in order to ease out the logistical challenges faced by our stakeholders in carrying out tour related operations, due to the prevailing situation in the country,” Sri Lanka Cricket said in a statement.
The capital has been engulfed by protests over Sri Lanka’s worst-ever economic crisis, which has forced its 22 million people to endure shortages of food, fuel and medicines since late last year.
Former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa fled his palace shortly before demonstrators invaded it last weekend and on Thursday resigned from the presidency.
The second and final Test begins July 24.

2,Australian Cameron Smith sees off McIlroy to win British Open,He is the first Australian in almost three decades to win the British Open since 1993.,"

ST ANDREWS: Australia’s Cameron Smith putts on the ninth green during the final round on the fourth day of the British Open on The Old Course on Sunday.—AFP

 
ST ANDREWS: Australia’s Cameron Smith claimed his first major title on Sunday after a stunning final round of 64 saw him win the 150th British Open at St Andrews by a one-stroke margin.
Smith began the day four shots off the lead but his eight-under-par final round lifted him to 20-under for the championship and allowed him to finish a shot clear of Cameron Young of the United States, with a frustrated Rory McIlroy another shot back in third.
At the age of 28, Smith is the first Australian in almost three decades to win the British Open since Greg Norman claimed his second Claret Jug at Royal St George’s in 1993.
McIlroy, the favourite coming into the week, had started the day in a share of the lead on 16 under par, alongside Norway’s Viktor Hovland, but the Northern Irishman was left to rue a series of missed birdie putts in his final two-under-par round of 70 as he ended at 18-under.
With Hovland fading badly with a 74, that left the door open for one of the chasing pack and Smith took full advantage thanks to an incredible performance on the back nine.
After reaching the turn at two-under for his round, the world number six embarked on a run of five consecutive birdies from the 10th hole and then rolled in another at the last.
Just before that he showed nerves of steel to save par at the 17th, the legendary Road Hole, but he needed that birdie at the final hole as his playing partner Young produced an eagle to finish with a 65 and end on 19-under.
A play-off was avoided, and the Brisbane native with the trademark mullet has his first major.
It comes after he finished tied third at this year’s Masters, a tournament in which he also came second in 2020.
McIlroy’s wait to win a fifth major title, eight years after his last, goes on and he can only wonder what might have been had he been more ruthless on the greens around St Andrews.
He had been hoping to win his second British Open following his 2014 triumph at Hoylake.
England’s Tommy Fleetwood finished in a tie for fourth alongside Hovland on 14 under par.

“Consider me retired from T20 internationals from today,” Tamim wrote on his verified Facebook page after he led Bangladesh to a 3-0 sweep over West Indies in a One-day International series in Guyana.
Tamim has been Bangladesh’s most prolific batsman, accumulating 14,726 international runs across all formats.
He has not played a Twenty20 international since March 2020 but continued to play other formats, leading the country’s 50-over side for the last two years.
The only Bangladeshi batsman to score a hundred in all three formats, Tamim’s scored 1,758 runs at an average of 24.08 in 78 Twenty20 international.
His only century came against Oman in the preliminary round of the 2016 T20 World Cup at Dharamshala, India.
Bangladesh face Zimbabwe in a three-match Twenty20 series beginning later this month to build towards this year’s T20 World Cup in Australia.

5,Philipsen wins Tour de France stage 15 as Vingegaard hits the deck,Alpecin-Deceuninck rider Philipsen timed his effort to perfection to beat compatriot Wout van Aert and Dane Mads Pedersen.,"CARCASSONNE: Belgian Jasper Philipsen claimed his maiden victory on the Tour de France when he won a bunch sprint in the 15th stage as overall leader Jonas Vingegaard suffered a bad day on Sunday.
Alpecin-Deceuninck rider Philipsen timed his effort to perfection to beat compatriot Wout van Aert and Dane Mads Pedersen, who were second and third respectively.
Vingegaard retained the yellow jersey but hit the deck and lost two of his Jumbo-Visma team-mates as Steven Kruijswijk crashed out and Primoz Roglic did not take the start of the 202.5-km ride from Rodez after failing to recover from injuries.
With temperature above 40 degrees Celsius, organisers sprayed parts of the road with water to cool down the melting tar before the riders passed.
Nils Politt and Mikkel Honore built up an advantage of about 2:30 over the peloton while Michael Morkov was dropped early on and suffered an ordeal alone at the back.
The breakaway was reined in with 50km left, shortly after Vingegaard crashed along with team-mate Tiesj Benoot.
Vingegaard made it back into the peloton and still leads defending champion Tadej Pogacar by two minutes and 22 seconds.
Two Frenchmen, Alexis Gougeard and Benjamin Thomas, attacked with 48 kilometres remaining.
Thomas, a track pursuit specialist, went solo in the finale but was caught 500 metres from the line, leaving the French riders still waiting for their first stage win in this edition.
Monday is a rest day on the Tour de France.

6,Ton-up Pant sees India to ODI series win over England,"Pant made 125 not out, winning the game with a reverse-swept four off Joe Root as India finished on 261-5.","MANCHESTER: Rishabh Pant’s maiden One-day International century guided India to a five-wicket win over England at Old Trafford on Sunday to give the tourists a 2-1 series success against the 50-over world champions.
Pant made 125 not out, winning the game with a reverse-swept four off Joe Root as India finished on 261-5 after chasing down a target of 260 with 7.5 overs to spare.
The 24-year-old wicket-keeper received excellent support in a partnership of 133 in 19 overs with all-rounder Hardik Pandya after India had been faltering at 72-4.
Hardik made 71 after taking career-best figures of 4-24 in England’s 259 all out built on captain Jos Buttler’s 60 on his Lancashire home ground.
But Both batters, however, benefitted from England errors early in their respective innings.
Pant was reprieved on 18 when wicket-keeper Buttler missed a routine stumping chance off spinner Moeen Ali.
And Hardik had made just six when he pulled Brydon Carse over the head of Overton at fine leg after the fielder had carelessly walked in from the boundary edge.
Earlier, Reece Topley carried on from where he left off in England’s series-levelling 100-run win at Lord’s, where he took an England ODI best 6-24.
The 28-year-old left-arm quick removed the India top three of Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in a superb opening spell of 3-15 in five overs.
Kohli’s exit, caught behind for 17, meant the star batter had now gone 78 innings across all formats without an international hundred.
Hardik, though greeted Topley’s first ball back with a resounding straight drive for four.
Hardik completed a 43-ball fifty with before left-hander Pant reached the landmark by flaying Test captain Ben Stokes through long-off for a fifth four in 71 balls faced.
Hardik fell when well caught at midwicket off paceman Brydon Carse but Pant went into the 90s by going down on one knee to hoist David Willey for six.
The dynamic batter then completed a 106-ball century — remarkably his first in 27 matches at this level — including 10 fours and two sixes before winning the game to the delight of the massed ranks of India fans in a packed crowd.
Buttler’s 60 was his highest score since he succeeded the now retired Eoin Morgan as England’s white-ball skipper.
He shared stands of 75 and 49 with Moeen Ali and Liam Livingstone respectively, but just when it seemed England were about to cut loose, India pegged them back.
England started brightly after losing the toss, with Jason Roy hitting three overs in the first over of the match, from Mohammed Shami.
But Mohammed Siraj, recalled in place of the injured Jasprit Bumrah, out with back spasms in the only change by either side made following the second ODI, delivered a double-wicket maiden in the second over, dismissing both Jonny Bairstow and Root for three-ball ducks.
Roy and Stokes, England’s red-ball captain, shared an attractive stand of 54 in eight overs before they were each dismissed by Hardik.
Roy, having made 41, got into a tangle against a short ball and skyed a simple catch to Pant.
Stokes had advanced down the pitch several times during his 27 but Hardik out-thought him with a bouncer that cramped the left-handed batsman for room and led to a simple return catch.
Hardik struck twice in an over to remove the big-hitting Liam Livingstone and Buttler with the aid of excellent catches in the deep by Ravindra Jadeja to leave England struggling at 199-7.
England begin a three-match ODI series at home to South Africa on Tuesday, with India travelling to the Caribbean for an ODI series against the West Indies commencing in Trinidad on Friday.

7,Kerley wins world 100m gold in US clean sweep,EUGENE: American Fred Kerley led a US clean sweep as he stormed to victory in the men’s 100m at the World...,"EUGENE: American Fred Kerley led a US clean sweep as he stormed to victory in the men’s 100m at the World Championships in Oregon on Saturday.
Kerley, in lane four, trailed Marvin Bracy for 95 metres of the tight race, but managed to outdip his teammate for victory in 9.86 seconds at Eugene’s Hayward Field.
Bracy took silver in 9.88sec, Trayvon Bromell claiming bronze in the same time for a third-ever 100m world championship clean sweep for the United States after 1983 and 1991.
The fourth of the strong US quartet, Christian Coleman, the reigning world champion from Doha in 2019 who was banned from the Tokyo Olympics for missing three doping tests, finished sixth (10.01) despite an electric start. 
“We said we were going to do it and we did! USA, baby!” Olympic silver medallist Kerley said to roars of approval and applause from a partisan home crowd. 
“I didn’t know until I looked up and saw the clock with my name ‘Fred Kerley’ on it,” added Kerley, whose path to gold was made easier by the withdrawal of Italy’s Olympic champion Marcell Jacobs earlier Saturday. 
“It means a lot and I’ve done something not many 400m runners have done,” Kerley said, adding: “I know today opened up many doors for me. The future is bright for me.” 
The last US cleansweep featured Carl Lewis, Leroy Burrell and Dennis Mitchell, something not lost on the modest Kerley or silver medallist Bracy. 
“It’s amazing to be among the great, they did it in 1991, we did in 2022,” Bracy said. 
“This is history, to be part of something that has only happened three times ever just means the world to me.” 
Bracy meanwhile paid tribute to Kerley’s remarkable versatility. The 27-year-old started his career as a 400m specialist before switching down to the shorter 100m. 
“The guy’s special, he’s a rare talent to be able to do all three events, his range is limitless. He might do 800m next year, we don’t know!  
“He’s a special cat, amongst an elite group of people like the (Usain) Bolts the Wayde van Niekerks.” Kerley has now set his sights on the 200m starting Monday, and is also not ruling out runs in the 4x100m and 4x400m relays. 
“If the coach allows me!” Kerley told reporters.
It was far from plain sailing for the in-form Kerley, who set out his stall with a heat-winning 9.79sec on Friday, as all the sprinters got off to a good start.
Bracy and Coleman looked like they might deprive Kerley of a gold many had predicted he would win.
But they hadn’t counted on his savage finishing skills, the former 400m runner showing all his strength at the line. Bromell also left it late to sneak onto the podium from lane eight.
As the crowd realised it was a US cleansweep, chants of “U-S-A” rang out and flags brandished.
Jamaica’s Oblique Seville finished fourth in 9.97sec, just ahead of South African Akani Simbine, who was clocked at 10.01 like Coleman in sixth.
Japan’s Abdul Hakim Sani Brown and Canada’s Aaron Brown were seventh and eighth, in 10.06 and 10.07sec respectively.
Failing to advance from the semi-finals to the final were Canada’s Olympic 200m champion Andre de Grasse, also a two-time 100m bronze medallist, and 2011 world champion Yohan Blake of Jamaica.
The build-up to the final was rocked by the decision of Olympic champion Jacobs to withdraw just hours before the semi-finals with tightness in his right thigh.
Italian team doctor Andrea Billi said that evaluation of the contraction had found a “clinical picture that can put muscle integrity at risk and lead to injury”.
Jacobs, who pulled off one of the shocks of the Tokyo Olympics last year when he stormed to victory in the 100m in 9.80sec, was crowned world indoor 60m champion in Belgrade in March but has struggled with injury since. 
“I am a fighter and this is why I decided to be in Eugene,” he tweeted, saying it had been a “painful choice, I am forced to stop”.

8,Taijul takes five as Bangladesh sweep past West Indies,PROVIDENCE: Taijul Islam made a triumphant return to One-day International cricket with his first five-wicket haul ...,"PROVIDENCE: Taijul Islam made a triumphant return to One-day International cricket with his first five-wicket haul as Bangladesh completed another series sweep of the West Indies, winning the third and final fixture by four wickets at the Guyana National Stadium on Saturday.
Playing his first ODI for more than two years, Taijul had a dream start with a wicket off his first delivery to set the stage for an outstanding effort.
He finished with impressive figures of 5-28 as the home side were dismissed for 178 off 48.4 overs batting first.
Bangladesh stumbled along the way in pursuit of the modest target with Gudakesh Motie claiming career-best figures of  4-23.
However, the left-arm spinner could not prevent the tourists reaching the target with nine balls to spare.
Liton Das set the Bangladeshis on the way to an 11th consecutive ODI win over the West Indies with an even 50 while captain Tamim Iqbal played his part with 34.
They seemed determined to trip themselves up with some careless shots though before an unbeaten 32 from wicketkeeper-batsman Nurul Hasan in partnership with Mehidy Hasan saw them home.
“I was very fortunate to finally get an opportunity on this tour because I was practising and working very hard and I’m glad I made full use of it,” said Taijul via an interpreter on receiving the man of the match award.
His victims included top-scorer Nicholas Pooran, the West Indies captain ending a run of low scores in one-dayers with an innings of 73 off 109 balls with two sixes and four fours embellishing his innings.
Only three other players got into double figures in what was yet another sub-par overall batting effort by the Caribbean team.
“I felt I still left some runs out there but I am happy to finally get a decent score in ODIs even though it’s obviously disappointing to lose once again,” said Pooran.
“We have to lift our heads from here and try to learn from this experience because we have two more tough opponents ahead before we get a break.” West Indies start another three-match ODI series against India on Friday in Trinidad, followed by five T20 Internationals.
They then take on New Zealand in three ODIs and three T20Is.
“I am really proud of this group to have completed back-to-back ODI series wins away from home,” said Tamim in noting that this triumph follows similar success in South Africa in the preceding campaign.
“We are missing three players in our top five so great credit has to be given to these players here who have stepped up to the challenge and delivered.” With 116 runs from the three matches at an average of 58, the Bangladesh skipper earned the additional accolade of man of the series.

9,United agree 67-million-euro deal to sign Ajax defender Martinez,MANCHESTER: Manchester United have agreed a deal with Ajax Amsterdam to sign defender Lisandro Martinez for an...,"MANCHESTER: Manchester United have agreed a deal with Ajax Amsterdam to sign defender Lisandro Martinez for an initial fee of 57.37 million euros ($57.87 million), with 10 million euros of potential add-ons included, both clubs confirmed on Sunday.
The deal is subject to a medical examination and a visa being granted, with completion expected in the coming days.
The length of the contract was not announced, but a source with knowledge of the agreement told Reuters that Martinez would sign a five-year deal with the Premier League club, with an option for a further 12 months included.
The 24-year-old, who can also play in midfield, will be manager Erik ten Hag’s third signing following the arrivals of Dutch left back Tyrell Malacia and Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen.
Ten Hag coached Martinez for three seasons at Ajax after the player moved to the Netherlands from Argentine side Defensa y Justicia in May 2019. Martinez made 118 appearances for the Dutch club.
A new defender was seen as priority for United after their struggles at the back last season. They conceded 57 goals last term, the most among the Premier League’s top six and 31 more than champions Manchester City.
The deal comes too late for Martinez to join up with his United team-mates on their pre-season tour in Australia. They open the new league campaign at home to Brighton & Hove Albion on Aug 7.
