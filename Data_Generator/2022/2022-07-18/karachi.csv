0,7 die as fresh spell of rain plays havoc with Karachi,A woman and her infant son drown in open drain; four die from electrocution.,"KARACHI: Seven people were killed in the metropolis on Sunday as the second spell of torrential rain under the current monsoon season wreaked havoc on the ill-maintained municipal and civic infrastructure inundating roads that led to crippling traffic jams on key arteries.
By 8pm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed received highest amount of rainfall i.e. 59 millimetres, followed by Quaidabad (34mm), Orangi Town (32.8mm), 31mm each at Jinnah Terminal and Saadi Town, 29.5mm at Airport old area, 23.5mm at Korangi, 23mm at Sharae Faisal, 18mm at Masroor Base, 12.5mm at University Road, 20mm at Nazimabad, 18mm at North Karachi, 15mm at DHA, 16mm at Keamari and 10 mm at Gadap town.
Woman, son drown
A woman and her infant son drowned and her husband was rescued when their bike fell in an open drain in Shadman Town on Sunday evening. 
Central SSP Maroof Usman said that the man was immediately rescued, but the body of woman, identified as Saman Danish, was recovered later near Anda Mor.

He said search for the minor child was going on.
Four die from electrocution 
A young man was electrocuted in Orangi Town on Sunday night. An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said that Farhan Khalid, 28, died when he suffered an electric shock on a street known as Phool Wali Gali in Orangi-10. The body was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH).
Another man died in Buffer Zone on Sunday night. Taimuria SHO Abdul Rasheed said that Akbar Khan, 50, suffered an electric shock inside his home near Ali Building and died. The body was shifted to ASH. 
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said two more persons — Younus, 35, and Kaleem, 80 — died of electric shock in Liaquatabad and Orangi Town, respectively.
Meanwhile, a man died of lightning on the outskirts of the city on Sunday evening.
The Memon Goth police said that Raju Hashim died at Shaikh Mohalla in Jam Mehar Goth. The body was shifted to a hospital. 
More rain expected
The fresh spell of the strong monsoon system developing in the Arabian Sea for the last three days brought rains in almost all city districts that tested the patience of Karachiites and mainly those living in low-lying areas and resulting in accumulation of rainwater on main thoroughfares.
The Met office said that under the influence of a depression (Intense Low-Pressure Area) over Northeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Gulf of Kutch, different areas of Karachi received moderate to heavy showers and more showers including some heavy falls are expected on Monday (today) as well.
“The low pressure area, which converted into a depression, moved in west-northwest direction with a speed of 10-km per hour during the last 12 hours and now lies at a distance of about 160km south of Karachi and 140km from Thatta,” said Sardar Sarfaraz of the Met office.
“The maximum sustained surface wind is 50-55 km per hour around the system centre. The system is likely to move westward (towards Oman coast). Under the influence of this weather system, rain-wind-thunderstorms with a few heavy/very falls are likely in Karachi, Hyderabad, Thatta and almost across Sindh.
He maintained that sea conditions would remain very rough during the next two to three days advising fishermen to avoid venturing into the sea “at least till Monday night”. 
Minutes after the rainfall, which triggered in the second half of the day, the city infrastructure started failing to cope up with the emerging situation. 
The city roads one after another turned packed with queues of vehicles amid blockade of thoroughfares due to accumulation of rainwater. 
Additional deployment of traffic officials and machinery to pump out water by the city administration eased the situation to some extent on some roads but large number of interactions continued to face the same situation even after rain stopped at around little over 9pm in most parts of the city.
A Traffic police spokesperson said barring few place, rains in the metropolis did not cause traffic problems anywhere. 
Because of accumulation of rainwater at the Madam Bridge in Malir on National Highway, the traffic has been diverted from Jinnah JTC towards the Star Gate.
He said because of rainwater in underpass at Submarine Chowrangi, the road from Boat Basin towards Punjab Colony had been closed for motorbike riders while other track was opened for traffic from Punjab Chowrangi towards the Boat Basin.
The K-Electric, however claimed that the supply to most areas of the city continued during the rain spell, saying power is being supplied to the city through 1,750 feeders out of 1,900 feeders.

1,Another Indian plane lands at Karachi after fault in mid-air,"KARACHI: In a short span of less than two weeks, another Indian passenger plane developed a technical fault in...","KARACHI: In a short span of less than two weeks, another Indian passenger plane developed a technical fault in mid-air and made an unexpected landing at Karachi airport in the small hours of Sunday morning.
A spokesperson for the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) said that the flight of IndiGo, a low-cost airline of India, took off from Sharjah to (Indian) Hyderabad, but was diverted to Karachi when the pilot reported some fault and sought permission to land at Jinnah International Airport.
Pakistani authorities allowed the Indian airliner to land on humanitarian grounds. All 192 passengers and crew were also allowed to disembark from the aircraft and stay at a transit lounge, the spokesperson added.
In the meanwhile, IndiGo decided to send a team of engineers in a replacement aircraft to Karachi from Ahmadabad so that it could bring back the passengers.
The spokesperson said that the replacement aircraft landed in Karachi a little before 1am, and the engineers managed to rectify the fault and ready the plane good to fly. Both the planes, along with passengers, left the airport at around 1608 and 1630 hours, respectively, he added.
Earlier, in a statement shared by the PCAA with the media, the Indian airline said: “IndiGo flight 6E-1406, operating from Sharjah to Hyderabad was diverted to Karachi. The pilot observed a technical defect. Necessary procedures were followed, and as a precaution, the aircraft was diverted to Karachi. An additional flight is being sent to Karachi to fly the passengers to Hyderabad. The aircraft is currently being examined at the Karachi airport. IndiGo is planning to send another flight to Karachi to fly the stranded passengers.”
This is the second incident in less than two weeks, as on July 5, a Dubai-bound Indian aircraft, Boeing 737, of SpiceJet that carried 132 passengers and 12 crew members had made an unexpected landing at Jinnah International Airport after reporting some fault. 
Pakistani authorities allowed Indian passengers and crew to disembark from plane and stayed at the transit lounge purely on humanitarian grounds. Later, SpiceJet sent a replacement aircraft from Mumbai to bring back stranded passengers.
Meanwhile, the stranded passengers and the airliner staff praised, appreciated and thanked the airport management, said the PCAA spokesperson. 
He said an IndiGo flight technician, in his remarks, wrote that the airport staff treated them as VIPs. “Very good gesture. I really appreciate. Thank you, Pakistan,” he said.
Shijin, one of the passengers, stated: “I am so much happy to be in here for a very short time. It was my pleasure to be with these lovely people. They have done a wonderful job. Hats off to each and every one who works there. All the best and I pray for them, too.”

2,Rainwater causes Hub Dam to overflow; spillways open after water reaches 339 feet,Reservoir provides 100 MGD to Karachi.,"KARACHI: The Hub dam, located 56 kilometers from Karachi, on Sunday reached capacity and finally overflowed due to the ongoing spell of monsoon rains in Balochistan.
The water level of the dam, that provides 100 million gallons of water per day to the city, was recorded at 339.5 feet in the morning and by the evening it rose to nearly 340 leading to opening of spillway of the reservoir.
An official of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board told Dawn that the dam’s level was 322 feet before the start of monsoon rains in Balochistan and its level had already rose close to its maximum capacity of 340 feet. 
“Now the reservoir has got enough water and Karachi will be supplied with 100 million gallons of water per day for the next three years,” he added.

Reservoir provides 100 MGD to Karachi

Improve water supply
The KW&SB official said that the increase in water level of the Hub dam would improve the water supply in parts of Orangi Town, Baldia and other adjoining areas of district West.
He said that the spillway of the Hub Dam was opened after the water level in the reservoir.
The KW&SB official said that the water level in Hub Dam had risen to 338 feet last week. 
“The spillway of the reservoir is opened after the water level in the reservoir reaches 339 feet,” he added.
Earlier, the dam’s water level had risen to its maximum capacity of 340 feet after almost 13 years in 2020.
With a total capacity of 339 feet, the dam is extended to 24,300 acres with a gross storage capacity of 8,57,000 acre-feet water.
Sources said that Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) had already issued an alert to the residents of nearby areas warning them to take extra precautions.
They said that water was being discharged from the spillway of the waterworks to the Hub River, the natural boundary between Sindh and Balochistan, while general public was not being allowed to visit the dam and the river.
Reports also suggested that a number of stuck people had been evacuated in the catchment area of the Hub River which was spread thousands of kilometers in Sindh and Balochistan.

3,"Week past Eid, sacrificial animals in Karachi are gone, remains are not",City stinks as rainwater mixes with offal.,"KARACHI: Heaps of filthy garbage, stinking offal and animal remains littering the city since Eidul Azha have exposed the performance of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board and its garbage disposal contracting firms, as the stench from garbage dumps has enveloped almost every part of the metropolis that is bound to spread diseases.
The city of Quaid, by and large, has worn an extremely filthy look with stinking environment since Eidul Azha, and the situation aggravated with a new spell of monsoon rains on Sunday when offal and animal remains were seen either floating in ponds and puddles or lying soaked in different localities as the SSWMB and its contractors failed to remove garbage and filth from the city to designated landfill sites.
The SSWMB, however, on Saturday, had claimed that it had removed a total of 92,535 tonnes of garbage, offal and animal remains, and transported them to the landfill sites during the first four days of the Eidul Azha. It said that 18,520 tonne garbage was removed from district East, 13,349 tonne from South, 8,303 tonne from Malir, 10,177 tonne from West, 11,163 tonne from Keamari, 13,304 tonne from Korangi and 17,717 tonne from district Central.
The SSWMB said that 36,602 tonne of garbage was transported to Jam Chakru, 28,403 tonne to Gond Pass and 20,585 tonne to Shrafi Goth in landfill sites.

City stinks as rainwater mixes with offal

Despite the official claims, loads of garbage and filth littered several areas in the downtown and old town in district South such as Kharadar, Mithadar, Ranchore Line and Burns Road leading to a great deal of inconvenience to people, especially elderly and women who had to toddle over the makeshift passages of blocks and stones in stagnant and stinking water.
An elderly woman, resident of Bohra Pir locality near Ranchore Line, said that the stagnant rainwater had become so filthy and stinking that she had to keep windows of her flat closed most of the time.
Another resident of Burns Road said that the lanes and streets in the locality had become very filthy as offal and animal remains were still lying in ponds and puddles. 
“The stagnant rainwater and oozing sewage in front of the Sobraj Maternity Hospital has been there since the first drop of monsoon rain, but no authorities are there to clear the way to the hospital,” he deplored.
Sources in the municipal bodies said that the SSWMB’s contracting firm failed to remove offal and garbage from 70 per cent areas of districts East and South as they did not put in gear their entire machinery for disposal of garbage. 
They said that the contracting firm had dumped half of the machinery and vehicles in Mehmoodabad Workshop in Mehmoodabad and KMC Workshop in district South.
An official of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, who did not wish to be named, said that effective garbage disposal could not be carried out due to lack of machinery and staff. “The entire city has been stinking due to garbage,” he added.
A resident of district Central said that garbage bins were filled to capacity and piles of garbage had littered the whole district. 
“Piles of garbage can be seen along the streets and unauthorised garbage dens in the district,” said a resident of North Karachi, adding that only nominal door-to-door rickshaws were being used to fill the garbage bins with more and more garbage which was not being removed timely.
In many areas, choked sewerage lines added to the miseries of people, while open manholes posed threats to them.

4,"Deserving students receive free beautician, styling training",All the trainees belong to different ethnic groups having big dreams,"KARACHI: The place is nice and well lit. It smells quite nice, too. There are big mirrors fixed on either side of the walls with young ladies busy as bees as they sort out the products and stuff in the wheeled trolleys besides them.  
A group on one side is working on different hairstyles. Some are plugging in the hair dryer, some the hair straightening iron as they look at an assortment of mousse and gel to select what they’ll be needing. Each girl has a hairbrush, round or wire brush or a comb of some kind in hand as they go about their work.  
Meanwhile, there is another group on the other side giving facials or busy doing make-up.  
It is all happening under the watchful eye of trainers Saniya Khurram, Nissa Shayan and Saif Zulfiqar with the CEO of Munaiza’s Bakht Academy Munaiza Zulfiqar watching over both the trainers and the trainees. It’s a beauticians’ class obviously but this is no ordinary class. Instead of paying to take the course, the students here are all being taught by some of the best in the business for free.  

All the trainees belong to different ethnic groups having big dreams

And the training that they are receiving is not normal or regular training, it is international training. “The girls are showing so much potential and we are very proud of them,” one of the trainers, Saniya Khurram told Dawn.  
Asked about the difference between normal and international training, she explained that “international training helps you meet international standards.” 
About the training and the trainees, the CEO of Munaiza’s Bakht Academy, Munaiza Zulfiqar said that they were offering international standard training, with certification, free of cost to some eight to nine girls in Karachi and 13 in Hyderabad. She said they thought of this during the Covid-19 lockdowns when many people were finding it hard to make ends meet or were getting tired of just sitting at home doing nothing.  
“When Covid hit, we used to see families with so many issues. People were losing jobs. Many beauty salons were also closing and going out of business as they never reopened. That’s when the socially conscious came out to do their bit. There were ration collection and distribution drives. That’s when we also thought about providing skills to girls,” she said.  
The CEO was glad to report that their hard work was also paying off. “We have a batch here in Karachi that we are training and another in Hyderabad. The 13 girls in Hyderabad have all found employment with big salons there and the ones in Karachi will also easily get good jobs after being equipped with world-class training,” she said, adding that they were affiliated with several international companies.  
“The training we are offering is second to none. Our other regular students pay around Rs200,000 for this course. But these girls are not asked to pay us anything. Not even the product kits that they need for practicing. We provide them with everything, even food, during our five-hour sessions,” she said, adding that they even suspended normal salon work for these classes.  
“International affiliation gives our students international certifications, followed by diploma courses and the master class,” she said. “Otherwise, if they go abroad where a girl is earning $20 an hour, our girls only get paid one-fourth of that amount. International training brings them at par with the other girls doing the same work,” she said.  
It was a feel-good moment to speak to the students. Some had come from Lyari, Gulshan-i-Hadeed, Garden East, Saddar, etc. They all belonged to different ethnic groups and they all had big dreams for themselves. Some wanted to specialise in hair, some skin, some shared their dreams of opening their own salon someday.  
“It is a big change that I see in them from the girls who first came to us. I am loving their confidence,” said Munaiza Zulfiqar when reminded that some of the girls might even open up a salon right across theirs and give them some tough completion.

6,"This week 50 years ago: Damaged Liaquatabad, Frere markets and Urdu council","THE riots in Karachi sparked by the language bill passed by the Sindh Assembly on July 7, 1972 had caused...","THE riots in Karachi sparked by the language bill passed by the Sindh Assembly on July 7, 1972 had caused considerable damage to the people and infrastructure in the city. The hardest hit neighbourhood was Liaquatabad whose famous KMC Market building had collapsed with a big explosion. 
On July 18, this newspaper ran a story according to which the Liaquatabad KMC Market would be rebuilt. Proposals were under study to make better land use in order to provide space for a larger number of shops on the site. Although it was early to give a detailed outline of the new shopping centre, M M Usmani, administrator of the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC), indicated on July 17 that the new market might be a multi-storey structure providing space for office accommodations as well.
The next day, on July 19, President Tehreek-i-Istiqlal Air Marshal Asghar Khan assured the residents of Liaquatabad that his party would support them wholeheartedly. Mr Khan during his visit to the area was welcomed by the residents. Addressing them, he said he was shocked to see Karachi affected by the riots. “You are the builders of Pakistan. We are with you and continue to raise the voice of truth at all costs,” he remarked. He also strongly criticised the government and urged upon the citizens to live peacefully with their Sindhi brethren. 
Among the structures which were set on fire in the riots was a night club on Frere Road (as mentioned in the previous week’s column). On July 21, it was reported that the Karachi Municipal Corporation (KMC) might not renew the lease of the night club in its Frere Market building which was set ablaze by an angry mob. The matter was being considered on the reports presented by the engineers about the weakened foundation and other structural defects developed by the double-storey piece of construction due to the fire. Unlike the Liaquatabad Market which had been partially blown up and was now proposed to be dismantled and reconstructed on a priority basis, the engineers had expressed the view that Frere Market could still be used for some more years with essential repairs.
In the meantime, on July 18, a representative citizens’ meeting in Karachi formed the Urdu National Council with Mahmudul Haq Usmani as its convener to protect, project and promote the socioeconomic and cultural rights of the Urdu speaking people in Sindh. 
A 24-member ad hoc committee was appointed on the occasion. The meeting, presided over by President Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Karachi, Maulana Asfandyar and attended by Mohajirs, Pakhtuns, Punjabis and Gujaratis, said in a resolution that the struggle to achieve a self-respecting and deserving position in Sindh would continue peacefully and within constitutional and democratic norms.
On July 21, disturbance on a smaller scale took place in Karachi for an entirely different reason. A new foreign film caused a near-riot like situation because of which the police had to resort to baton charge to disperse an unruly crowed which had earlier pelted stones at, and damaged property of, a local cinema hall. The movie with a provocative title (name not given in the news item) was due for release that day. 
People had started queuing up to get the tickets six hours before show time — that is, from 9am. By show-time, the entire compound of the cinema hall was full of people. Since most of the eager crowd could not get the tickets, they became unruly. The crowd went away after the police’s arrival.

In a letter written to the FIA director general on July 15, the provincial police chief stated that on July 11, a young man, Bilal Kaka, was killed during a fight at a restaurant near Hyderabad bypass after a “dispute over a food bill” at an eatery.
“Some miscreant groups on social media started spreading rancorousness which triggered ethnic tensions between Sindhis and Pakhtuns in major cities of Sindh, creating serious law and order situation,” the letter said.
The IGP requested the FIA to issue necessary instructions to the director of the cyber crime wing of its Sindh Zone to “strictly monitor such illegal activities and take stern legal action to discourage conspiracy on linguistic grounds to avoid any untoward situation”.
Meanwhile, a police spokesperson in a statement said that the Sindh police and the FIA would jointly initiate legal action against elements involved in spreading propaganda and creating fear and panic among the people.
“Monitoring of social media accounts and social media users who were spreading false information, propagating ethnic prejudice and other illegal activities has been started,” declared Mr Memon.
The IGP vowed that no leniency would be shown to the elements that were creating panic and fear among the people and triggering law and order situation.
He urged the people not to give any heed to rumours being spread about closure of roads, markets or related to ethnic hatred.
He asked the people to cooperate with the police for maintenance of law and order and promotion of harmony among the people.
Separately, the IG Sindh has set up an investigation team led by SP Headquarters to probe the incident in Hyderabad. He said the investigation of the incident should be impartial and transparent.
The AIG-Operations in his report to the IGP stated that total 15 untoward incidents had been reported from the province in wake of the Hyderabad incident. As many as 12 FIRs had been registered and total 90 people have been arrested in the province.
“The police have launched a province-wide crackdown on the elements involved in criminal activities,” said Mr Memon.

10,"Eight years on, rain-fed Darawat Dam fails to prove its utility","HYDERABAD: Even after passage of eight years to its inauguration, rain-fed Darawat Dam has not been able to harvest...","HYDERABAD: Even after passage of eight years to its inauguration, rain-fed Darawat Dam has not been able to harvest enough rainwater to be utilised for irrigating land in its command area, nor the little water available in the reservoir can be released for a host of technical issues. 
The dam — a brainchild of PPP government when Asif Ali Zardari was president in 2008 — was built at a cost of Rs11.67bn and completed in 2014 but its utility remains to be proved. It is purely a rainwater harvesting dam but strangely, the rainfall has not yet filled the dam till this day to its optimum level of 112.5 metres. 
Then president Zardari had inaugurated the reservoir in March 2013 and remarked optimistically at the ceremony: “When I will visit this place next time I will see cotton cultivated here.” Unfortunately, his words have still not seen the light of the day. 
According to Chief Engineer of Small Dams, Shafqat Wadhu, the dam’s current level is 108 metres — four metres short of the optimum level when its spillways will have to be opened. “The dam can, however, feed agricultural land at the current level but still water can’t be released due to a number of land related issues,” Wadhu said, adding that the level of 106 metres was said to be sufficient for releasing water for irrigating land in the command area.
Even back to back rains have failed to fill the dam to its capacity. The dam was to store flows of Nai Baran, one of the old natural waterways in the area, which were otherwise used by locals to irrigate their land during rainy season.
The dam is to irrigate around 25,000 acres of land through a canal originating from the dam and its distributaries. At the time of the commencement of the project the PPP government had decided to grant land to landless peasants and a few farmers did get land for cultivation, according to a report.
The dam falls within jurisdiction of two districts, Thatta and Jamshoro. Its structure falls within Jamshoro district which is spread over 10,500 acres with a storage capacity of 121,600 acre feet and the command area is to be developed in Thatta district. 
The command area’s development means creation of watercourses for irrigating land of the farmers who are supposed to get land under the government’s scheme. “Around 25 farmers are given land in the area but we need to conduct a survey of land in the area,” said Thatta deputy commissioner Ghazanfar Qadri.
Compensation for dam’s land not yet paid
Khalid Detho claimed that his land was used for building the reservoir and he had not yet received compensation. “There are pieces of surveyed lands that have been used in the dam upstream and the land owners are still waiting for compensation,” said Detho.
The dam’s control had remained with Wapda that had built it for a long time. It was only in 2020 when the dam’s operations were taken over by Sindh government’s irrigation department. 
“The irrigation water is to be supplied to farmers who have legal land documents. We had sent some documents for verification to revenue department as per procedure but have not received them back,” said Wadhu.
Initially, it was also claimed by government functionaries that a high efficiency irrigation system would be provided to land allottees and agriculture department was to handle it but since the command area’s development itself has been put on the backburner the high efficiency irrigation system too takes a back seat. 
The dam had a test run in 2018 for a few minutes. It has a major canal on the right side, two distributaries and one minor that will irrigate land in future.
As a federal funded project, the dam — located 135km north east of Karachi and 70km west of Hyderabad — was completed on Aug 31, 2014 by a Chinese firm, which started work on it in January 2010 in Jhangri village, Jamshoro district. 
The dam proves a bane for locals
The dam’s site is suitable for a spate-irrigation in which seasonal flows are received in a torrent or stream. Nai Baran carries such hill torrents emanating from lower Khirthar mountain range in Balochistan’s Bella district during rains.
The communities dependent on Nai Baran were said to have been affected and they claimed the dam’s storage structure had submerged their cultivable land and deprived the population living downstream of seasonal flows of the hill torrent which they had been using for agricultural purposes before the construction of the dam.
Sindh Chamber of Agriculture leader Nabi Bux Sathio, who had visited the dam in 2019  said: “I think the dam is not irrigating even 25 acres out of 25,000 acres in the command area. We fear the dam’s structure will fall into disuse,” he claimed. 
He feared the dam’s project would prove to be a repeat of the Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) and Chotiyari reservoir in Sanghar. “The tube-wells installed under the SCARP that were supposed to control salinity in waterlogged area have been gathering rust for years and the same is the case with Chotiyari reservoir which has destroyed more land due to seepage than benefit it through its water,” he argued. 
Darawat, he said, could become an attractive tourist spot like Rawal dam. “I think we are not ready to look at these aspects,” he deplored.

The decision to this effect was made at a meeting chaired by Sindh Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh and attended among others by the representatives of mine owners and miners’ associations.
The energy minister also allowed mining in Lakhra coal mines in district Jamshoro on the demand of the mine owners.
While talking to Dawn, he said that the ban on mining in Jhimpir would continue due to the monsoon season.
He warned that in case of an accident, action would be taken against the entire ownership of the mine under the law in case of any incident in the mines.
He said that the accident in a Jhimpir mine was very unfortunate in which nine precious lives of labourers were lost.
He said that the FIR of the Jhimpir incident had been registered on the complaint of the chief inspector of mines. 
“The manager and the contractor named in the FIR have been arrested,” he said, adding that police were conducting raids to arrest the owner of the mine and soon he would also be arrested.
Mr Shaikh said the owner and contractor of the ill-fated mine continued mining during heavy rains that led to unfortunate tragedy.
He said that the provincial government was deliberating upon a permanent law to be made to prevent such incidents in the future.
“The provincial government will take all measures to protect the lives of mine workers,” he added.
The energy minister said that safety audit was being done for all the mines in Thatta and Jamshoro under the existing laws for the safety of the miners. “If there is a deficiency in any mine, the permit of the mine owner will be cancelled and action will also be taken under the mining laws,” he warned.
He said that two rescue centres would be established in Lakhra for the convenience of miners and ambulances, doctors and paramedical staff would be appointed for them.
