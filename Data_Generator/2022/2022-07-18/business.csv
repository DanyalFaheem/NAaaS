0,Cash is cash for businesses,Businesses continue to use traditional methods of payment in the absence of appropriate options.,"


 
For all its shortcomings, the e-banking ecosystem in Pakistan has taken major leaps over the last couple of years in part thanks to Covid-19. Since March 31, 2020, internet and mobile banking users have increased from 3.81 million and 8.19m to reach 7.83m and 11.98m respectively as of the third quarter of 2021-22 (Q3FY22). In terms of transactions, the growth curve has been even steeper.
The value of internet and mobile banking transactions surged from Rs748.1 billion and Rs467.5bn at the end of Mar 31, 2020, to Rs2.91 trillion and Rs3.09tr respectively as of the previous quarter. Similarly, their volumes grew from 14.1m and 21.2m to 38.3m and 101.5m respectively over the same period.
However, all this digitisation has been largely concentrated in consumer banking. On the corporate and business side, the processes are still very much traditional and cash (or cheques) is cash. This is despite the segment being much bigger thanks to the higher turnover and bulk payments.
While exact numbers on their scale aren’t available, paper-based and real-time online banking (RTOB) transactions can serve as a good proxy for the segment’s flow of money. The former recorded a value of Rs46.4tr and volume of 96.m in Q3FY22 — meaning the average transaction was worth almost Rs481,000. Meanwhile, the latter saw a throughput of Rs26.8tr with volume at 52.3m and an average of around Rs512,000.

While e-banking has grown leaps and bounds to trillions of rupees, businesses continue to use traditional methods of payment in the absence of appropriate options

Yet, for all this massive scale, the segment is severely under-served in terms of online offerings. Only two banks — Alfalah and Allied Bank Limited — currently have a mobile app for businesses though many others offer internet banking. But the experience is far from digital. For example, if you happen to have a company account with one of the leading banks, the web portal’s dashboard is literally a blank page. It doesn’t even show the existing balance and in order to check that, you will have to generate a statement for a specific period. And that can sometimes take hours, according to a source who uses the product.
“The web portal only runs on Internet Explorer (IE), which is not supported by Windows 11 so in order to access it, I have to first open Edge and then turn on the IE mode. From a user interface/user experience point of view, it’s a travesty with no consistency between button placements, for example, and it takes hours to just figure out how to check the balance,” he adds.
Sufian Asif of Dustiyaab Tech, an early-stage startup, shared a similar experience with another prominent bank. “Although their customer service is commendable, the online banking features for private limited company accounts are limited to just one thing: view the balance,” he said.
Principally, it should be the bankers asking this question but what do businesses, especially smaller ones, even want from their banks? Not a lot, honestly. “For starters, there should be easier access for e-banking, be it via mobile app or web version,” says Hammad Khan, CEO of Alpha Venture, a digital agency based out of Karachi.
“The payroll management system should also be smarter as it’s very time-consuming right now. Similarly, the approval mechanism is super basic currently and needs more layers. Like I might want to give read-only access to my accountant without making him part of the approval system. This could be done via leveraging WhatsApp possibly where a lot of business decisions actually take place in the end, especially in smaller companies,” he adds.
“There is a lot of room for improvement in the transaction management system as well, like better labelling and faceted search,” Mr Khan continues. He also highlights the need for integrations with other third-party software, which are widely used especially in the technology sector. “Let’s say you could sync the banking transactions with Quickbooks or your customer relationship management tool. That record-keeping can make your life 100x easier.”
The issue is not only with just online banking products but even card-based ones. For example, only Bank Alfalah and Standard Chartered currently offer corporate credit cards, meaning no player has entered this line in years. And even the existing options are basically makeshift arrangements, according to people who used them.
One founder two years back shared with Dawn how their company’s corporate credit card was linked to his personal online banking account while getting it issued took three months, multiple forms, a guarantee on stamp paper, and a lien.
For cards, bankers attribute the lack of products to a minuscule market but the same doesn’t apply to digital products. The growth in consumer mobile and internet banking has already given a good glimpse of online’s potential, and the only thing holding back a similar trajectory for business segments is banks’ own laziness.

1,A hero uniting us or just another player?,Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s heritage may help him build an anti-war camp of emerging nations or he may turn out to,"Pakistan blames the Russia-Ukraine war for aggravating the county’s economic woes. The record high energy and food inflation in particular is attributed to the post-war price hike in global oil and commodity markets. The clarity of understanding of the war and its fallout did not translate into visible actions by Pakistan, thus far.
The economic diplomats can better elaborate on the possibilities but some concerned watchers and businessmen feel that the goodwill that the current foreign minister enjoys offers a unique opportunity. They thought familiarity with the world of Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s mother Benazir and grandfather ZA Bhutto can help him build an anti-war camp of emerging nations.
“He can charm world leaders and mobilise the youth globally to relaunch a peace movement. He can rally round other affected countries (Sri Lanka, Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, etc) pushed to the brink to pile pressure on warmongers to stop dragging the world backwards and force them diplomatically to stop the war immediately. It will not be hard to show how the war is threatening the foundations of the global order, inflicting pain and suffering all over the developing world,” an articulate observer said.
Read: Zardari says he wishes to see Bilawal as prime minister in his lifetime
No one can challenge that this armed conflict had a massive snowball effect driving up energy and grain prices, forcing central banks to raise policy rates, increasing the cost of living and business, suppressing economic activity, labour cuts and higher jobless levels. Social and political unrest can turn chaotic and violent in many places around the world.

Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s heritage may help him build an anti-war camp of emerging nations or he may turn out to be just another ineffectual politician

Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in a media talk recently hammered Pakistan’s neutral position in the conflict, underlining the highlighted threat to food and energy security in wake of the ongoing war. He claimed to be trying for the war to end through ‘diplomacy and dialogue’. He, however, did not share any further or mention any special initiatives on the details of the strategy adopted to this end.
Relevant sources in Islamabad, senior leaders including Hina Rabbani, Sherry Rehman and cabinet members of economic ministries were approached to get some sense of the progress on this diplomatic agenda with direct bearings on the wellbeing of people and businesses. A PML-N leader said he was too occupied with by-elections in Punjab to spare a thought or offer a quotable quote. Others did not respond till the filing of this report. A senior economic diplomat was travelling and said he had private discussions on the subject in the US but needs time to articulate his thoughts to share publicly.
A senior government source sidelining the issue of the Ukraine war insisted that the worst is over for the country and its people and that the ride ahead will not be as rough. “The government can’t afford to falter or be complacent so it must tread cautiously, desist from the temptation of populism and conduct economic diplomacy skillfully to revive business confidence and put the economy back on track,” he said.
“Expected disbursement of the International Monetary Fund tranche will allay fears of sovereign default and lend stability to the market. Yes, much will depend on the direction of energy and commodity price movement in the global market. Pakistan has taken an independent principled stand on the Ukraine war but it is too big a game for a small nation to influence,” he added.
A businessman upset with Prime Minister Shehbaz’s government’s policies blasted all political leaders. “This nation is hard of luck as far as political leaders go. They are all short-sighted. I am not in the business of issuing a certificate of patriotism but they are responsible for stifling the economy by abrupt changes in policies. How can anyone expect them to negotiate better in the global forums when they can’t deliver back home. They are often so self-obsessed that they ignore the consequences of their actions on the domestic economy, consumers and investors,” he lamented.
The sharp drop in growth in China confirmed the worst economic fears. Clouds of a global recession are hovering as nations continue to grapple with supply chain disruptions after the pandemic and Ukraine war. Record high inflation is driving up interest rates, piling hardships on people and businesses.
“It will be silly to rule out chances of further turmoil when people and businesses perceive painful economic adjustments a punishment for a crime they didn’t commit,” warned a watcher hinting at the charged political environment.

2,Riding the winds of change,"Through meaningful engagement and experiential learning, young adults can evolve into more informed and generous members of...","


 
The power of youth as a potential resource and agent of change for a country’s development can never be underestimated. Young people, once their potential is tapped and steered in the right direction, are often dynamic, innovative and passionate about contributing to a good cause.
The term ‘youth’ is recognised largely as the period from adolescence to early adulthood when an individual moves from dependence to independence, evolving into an active, responsible and productive member of society. Pakistan has the largest young population in the world with an estimated 64 per cent below the age of 30 years, of which about 29pc are aged between 15 and 29 years. While this poses challenges due to a dearth of employment opportunities and social services, its potential can, however, be effectively harnessed for sustainable development activities.
The absence of a formal national youth policy has meant a disjointed focus on areas of youth development. Pakistan’s Youth Development Index (YDI) value has improved sluggishly, 0.61 out of a potential maximum of 1. The fact that an estimated 27 million Pakistani youth are not engaged in any productive activity or are unemployed implies that they are both vulnerable and alienated from national issues.
A change in mindsets and social practices is clearly required. Pakistan National Human Development Report 2017 observes how mere education and employment are insufficient to empower young people unless they feel their ideas can influence policy making. They develop a sense of identity only when engaged in meaningful ways, their opinions heard and valued and their contributions acknowledged.

Through meaningful engagement and experiential learning, young adults can evolve into more informed and generous members of society, leading to a paradigm shift whereby Pakistani youths become philanthropists

One approach is to involve them in organised philanthropy and community participation. Youth philanthropy is the donation by youth of time, energy, talent, or resources — money, goods or services— for meaningful purposes and the common social good. These may vary from personal giving and volunteering time for social causes to fundraising activities and organised grantmaking.
Despite limited impact studies on youth philanthropy initiatives in the Pakistani context, the few that exist suggest that involving young people in philanthropic activities helps them acquire a better understanding of social and environmental issues; develop useful communication, decision-making, and leadership skills; and develop a sense of community ownership.
A common misconception about philanthropy is that it is the exclusive preserve of privileged adults. However, young people too are part of the culture of giving — whether contributing pocket money for a social cause, donating clothes to orphans or volunteering to read to the elderly. They must, therefore, be educated early about philanthropy and volunteerism, the importance of community service and the non-profit sector’s essential role. Here educational institutions can play a crucial role by inculcating values of compassion, empathy and civic responsibility.
Pakistan’s prevalent education system offers limited opportunities for young people to cultivate skills that render them responsible and productive community members. As a first step, policymakers may lobby for the support of federal and provincial ministries of education and textbook boards to formally integrate philanthropy into the school/college/university curricula. This would impart knowledge about the purpose, history and values of philanthropy, volunteerism, fundraising, civic education, and human rights.
Educational materials may reflect diversity in the case studies, and models of philanthropic initiatives they present, representing various communities. In fact, the Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy (PCP) has taken the initiative to pilot an academic course with wide-ranging themes on philanthropy in two universities in the private and public sectors, namely Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology (Szabist) and Fatima Jinnah Women University (FJWU).
Secondly, policymakers may link theory with practice by combining academic learning with community engagement, thereby expanding the network of community service learning and experiential philanthropy in school education programmes. The curricula may incorporate a mandatory community service-learning component, requiring students to conduct fieldwork in community organisations including orphanages, old homes, hospitals etc.
Partnerships and synergies between educational institutions and community organisations, teachers and youth organisations can effectively transmit philanthropic knowledge to youth to address community needs.
Thirdly, capacity-building programmes may train educators on ways of integrating philanthropy into lesson plans, thereby making it part of the required coursework rather than teaching it on an ad hoc basis.
Finally, practitioners including community foundations, youth organisations, government agencies and non-profits, may structure youth philanthropy programmes to ensure the authentic inclusion of young people, particularly from marginalised and minority groups. This may go beyond mere cosmetic participation or “decorating” a project with young people to meaningfully involving them in planning and decision-making roles.
Youth-adult collaborative platforms may allow young people the opportunity to voice their opinions and engage in critical dialogue with adults on social justice issues. Adults in youth projects can equip young people with the tools to take the lead in different project activities, whether identifying community issues, determining the best ways to address them, sharing ideas on generating sustainable funding sources for philanthropy or evaluating socio-economic impacts.
In all, nurturing an early interest in “giving back to society” may be the initial push towards systemising youth philanthropy and fostering a culture of positive youth development and civic engagement. Through meaningful engagement, skill-building, and experiential learning, Pakistani youth can evolve into more informed, proactive, empathetic, and generous members of society. This may lead to a paradigm shift whereby Pakistani youth is perceived as a valuable resource and asset rather than a liability for meeting the challenges of the changing world.

3,Continuing fertiliser troubles,The heatwave and canal water shortages that continued till the first week of July aggravated the fertiliser availability problem.,"


 
Punjab is the breadbasket of Pakistan and also the largest consumer of fertilisers. At least 70 per cent of all the compost marketed in the country is sold and consumed in the province and thus it is also the worst victim in case of any pricing or availability crisis.
The total national demand for urea for both Kharif and Rabi crops is 6.1 million tonnes, while the production capacity is 6.5mt. Despite this more-than-demand production, the country, and of course Punjab, is continuing to face fertiliser shortages owing to various factors.
Provincial agriculture high-ups say they had conveyed to the federal authorities about the urea shortage in November last year before the peak offtake for the wheat crop. But the compost either remained in short supply or was sold at higher rates throughout the Rabi season. The federal government was again informed well in time about the province’s urea requirements of 2.330mt for Kharif 2022.
The month-wise breakup of the projected demand was 300,000mt for April, 400,000mt for May, 470,000mt for June, 440,000mt for July, 410,000mt for August, and 310,000mt for September, respectively. However, for May, the urea supplies were 269,695mt against the demand of 400,000mt, 32.58pc less than the requirement. The gap between demand and supply was squeezed for June as 455,546mt urea was received against the requirement of 470,000mt.

Despite the heatwave and canal water shortages that continued till the first week of July, acreage of major crops is on the rise and thus the high demand for urea and nitrogen compost

Justifying the growing demand for the soil nutrient, Director-General Agriculture (Extension) Dr Anjum Ali says that despite water shortages acreage of major crops is on the rise and thus the high demand for urea and nitrogen compost.
Cotton has been sown on 3.696 million acres against the target of 4m acres. Last year, 3.168m acres had come under the white lint. Likewise, paddy plantation is set to be over 6.34m acres against the target of 5.0m acres, autumn corn sowing will claim 1.2m acres and sugarcane (both spring and autumn) 2m acres.
The heatwave and canal water shortages that continued till the first week of July aggravated the fertiliser availability problem and increased the urea consumption over and above the projected demand. Urea availability becomes critical at peak stages of both Rabi (December-February) and Kharif (midMay-July) crops as most of the urea-producing plants are located outside the province beyond its monitoring control.
Calcium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN) is being produced at a rate of 70,000 tonnes per month with the cotton crop as its major beneficiary and thus is supplementing nitrogen supplies in addition to urea in Punjab.
However, the hoarding and smuggling of whatever quantity of available compost is compounding the problem to the disadvantage of the farmers. Dr Anjum Ali claims that during the last six months an on-spot fine of Rs 20.497 million has been imposed and 290 FIRs (First Information Report)registered in the drive against hoarding and overcharging.
The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) has recently approved a further increase of Rs400 per bag of urea putting an additional burden of Rs48 billion on farmers in an abortive bid to bridge the whooping over Rs7,000 per bag price difference between the local and international markets and thus check fertiliser smuggling.
An as anti-smuggling measure and to ensure a smooth supply of urea in the local market, the Ministry of Industries & Production has suggested a framework to the provincial governments after consultations with industry representatives. These include the distribution of urea fertilisers by dealers on presentation of relevant documents by farmers to ensure equitable distribution, issuance of receipts to buyers and the establishment of dedicated help-lines to monitor complaints related to overcharging by dealers.
The notified urea fertiliser retail price is at Rs1,850 per 50kg (the raise approved by the ECC is yet to be passed by the cabinet). The measures were necessitated because the market price of urea is hovering between Rs2,200 and Rs2,700 primarily due to the smuggling of the heavily subsidised compost despite the reduction in the rates by the manufacturers. The Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council said last Friday that the maximum retail price of urea has been fixed at Rs2,200 per bag.
The government and fertiliser executives agreed that a coupon-based mechanism would be introduced in which prices of urea would be increased in line with the gas cost. The small farmers would though be protected through a direct subsidy via coupons to ensure that the grant for domestic farmers remains within the country.
However, the farmers already availing subsidy worth Rs1,000 per bag of DAP (Di-ammonium Phosphate) through the coupon system are apprehensive of the mechanism. Mian Umair, a leader of a faction of the Kissan Ittehad Pakistan, points out certain flaws and delaying tactics in the system that force the farmers to sell their coupons to agents for a paltry sum.
The higher amount of subsidy will further attract vested interests to finding new ways to manipulate the system for robbing deserving farmers of their rights.
The urea supply-side turbulence does not end here. There is an ongoing dispute between the government and the industry over a lack of measures to settle payments for outstanding subsidies, which also includes the sales tax disparity issue that is destabilising the market. A meeting between the industry’s representatives and Finance Minister Miftah Ismail failed to reach any conclusion on settling the dispute.
The government owes the industry about Rs80bn in paybacks. This includes subsidy receivables amounting to Rs19.2bn for the 2016-18 period, while general sales tax refund worth Rs60bn also remains unpaid and the volume is growing, causing a cash flow challenge for the industry, which is paying between 5 to 17pc input sales tax against 2pc output sales tax.
Another issue that is facing the industry and causing concern among consumers is an inconsistent gas supply to the urea manufacturing plants. The problem may be solved by bringing the price of feed gas for urea manufacturers at par with the general industrial gas tariff but this will lead to a further increase in fertiliser prices and the government may ill-afford its political cost.
There are four major producers of fertilisers — Fauji Fertiliser, Engro Fertiliser, Dawood Hercules, and Fatima Fertilisers. Engro Fertilisers claims they are receiving gas under the Petroleum Policy 2012 at the highest rate of over Rs1,100 per metric million British thermal unit (mmBTU), whereas RLNG-based players are paying Rs830 per mmBTU, impacting their profitability significantly.

4,Cruel food inflation,"Food inflation in Pakistan remains higher than in other Asian countries that too face impact of global fuel, commodity prices.","When media reports about rising food inflation, the numbers don’t tell how difficult the lives of financially poor people become with prices of food items increasing day by day.
But that doesn’t mean poor Pakistanis, in particular, and others, in general, have found a magic wand to fight food inflation. In fact, mere survival continues to become more and more challenging for tens of millions — month after month and year after year. But who cares?
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reports inflation measured through the Sensitive Price Index (SPI) — or price changes in 51 essential items — cumulatively and also separately for five “expenditure groups”. In the first group are people who spend up to Rs17,732 per month and in the last group fall those who spend more than Rs44,175.
Read: In times of high inflation, what should you invest in? 
The vast majority of Pakistani families can be categorised in the first four groups whose monthly spending remains somewhere between Rs17,732 and Rs44,175. The latest PBS figures show that during the week ending on July 6, yearly SPI inflation or inflation in prices of essential items for these four groups ranged between 27.3 per cent and 32.2pc. Can we imagine how difficult it would have become for these people to survive with a decline of 27.3-32.2pc in their real income within a year?

Food inflation in Pakistan remains much higher than in other Asian countries that too face the impact of international fuel and food commodity prices; in June average food inflation in China, India and Bangladesh stood at 2.9pc, 7.75pc and 8.3pc respectively

And, here the question of replacing some items or giving up some others doesn’t arise because the list of 51 essential items includes only those items that are most essential like petrol and CNG (in the fuel group) and wheat flour, rice, cooking oil, pulses and potatoes (in food group). The SPI inflation is very high and its impact on the lives of millions is outright life-threatening or at least life-crippling.
If we look at overall food inflation (as a component of the consumer price inflation) the picture is no different. In June, the yearly food inflation stood at 24pc in urban areas and 27pc in rural areas. Now, what does this mean for people falling anywhere between “expenditure groups” of Rs17,732 and Rs44,175 per month? It doesn’t take a poet’s heart to understand the miseries of such financially poor people who have to purchase food items at prices 24pc higher in urban areas and 27pc higher in rural Pakistan.
The whole story becomes further disappointing given the fact that the majority of such people don’t get any relief from the government. The federal government announced in June a monthly subsidy of Rs2,000 for all those who earn less than Rs40,000 per month to help them absorb inflationary pressures that erupted after a sharp rise in domestic fuel oil prices. Since providing even this meagre relief would cost the government an estimated Rs28 billion a month, federal ministers defend this low level of financial support that would help around 14 million “deserving families.”
First of all, not all people falling between expenditure groups of Rs17,735 and Rs44,175 would be eligible for this ‘generous’ relief. And, secondly, even for deserving families that qualify for it, it would hardly make an impact on their day-to-day life.

A three-litre pack of a leading brand of cooking oil was being sold for Rs1,800 against the printed price of Rs1,485

If you substitute the words “expenditure groups” with “income groups” which actually is the case for many among those who fall in the so-called “expenditure groups”, what does an additional monthly inflow of Rs2000 do? Those with a monthly income of Rs40,000 would have Rs42,000 to spend. That’s it. But this Rs42,000 would have purchasing power (in terms of food items) of Rs31,900 in urban Pakistan in terms of the real value of the money a year ago. In the rural areas, it would have an even lower value — Rs30,660. (These calculations have been made in view of the officially announced yearly food inflation of 24pc in urban areas and of 27pc in rural areas).
Food inflation in Pakistan has been on the rise as elsewhere in the world. There are no two opinions about that. But the problem is that our policymakers don’t acknowledge the fact that structural deficiencies in our agriculture sector, lack of effective coordination between federal and provincial governments, absence of effective district governments, very weak implementation of the laws against unfair market practices like smuggling, cartel making, hoarding and overcharging, price inelasticity of most essential food items, broken supply chains and the existence of a large grey economy also continue to fuel food inflation, in particular, and overall inflation in general.
Most of them find it convenient to blame international fuel and food commodity prices — and in our case the rupee’s depreciation — for rising food inflation.
Little wonder then that food inflation in Pakistan remains much higher than in other Asian countries that too face the impact of international fuel and food commodity prices. In June average food inflation in China, India and Bangladesh stood at 2.9pc, 7.75pc and 8.3pc respectively, according to Bloomberg.
Repeated wheat flour and sugar crises, and consequent spiralling up of their retail prices, seen during all governments and most recently during the PTI government are still fresh in the collective memory of Pakistanis. And the ongoing edible oil crisis and unjustifiable price hikes are still far from over.
During Eidul Azha, most retailers in Karachi were charging Rs100 per litre over and above the printed prices of edible oil and ghee. A three-litre pack of a leading brand of cooking oil was being sold for Rs1800 against the printed price of Rs1485. This betrays the claims of the local administration about effective checks on unfair business practices.

7,The optics of politics and restaurants,"""Closing one industry will not save costs when malls, ATMs, street lights and billboards are brightly lit.""","


 
A man rushes into the dessert place Hot Spot in Clifton, Karachi. “Panda off kar,” he shouts urgently to his colleague behind the ice cream counter. Outside, the shrill sound of police cars can be heard as next-door restaurant Damascus’s waiters urge customers to pay their bills and leave.
It’s day one of the energy-saving ban that was implemented in mid-June, requiring markets to close at 9pm and restaurants at 11pm. While in Clifton, there was a pandemic-like pall as the police urged lights to be switched off, at the Tipu Sultan food street there were traffic jams at half past midnight. Cars honked with the impatience all Pakistanis seem to be born with as friends, families and children trooped out of some lit, some dark, eateries. Clearly, not all restaurants intended to follow the rules.
A few days later, a waiter at the decades-old Village restaurant shrugs off the ban. “We close by 12am anyways, closing down an hour early has not impacted us much,” he says expressing much deeper concern over the lack of consistent deliveries amidst the startling high fuel prices.
Interview: ‘The narrative around hydro in Pakistan remains superficial’
Amongst ineffectual measures that die without a whimper, shutting down restaurants early for a month is among the top and seems to have been implemented for a reason as flimsy as the need to be appearing to do something in the face of a Sri Lanka-like crisis. Since then, the ban has been lifted over Eidul Azha and has not been implemented since.

The early closing of eateries, randomly implemented and soon forgotten, was little more than a flimsy political device of appearing to be doing something in the face of a crisis

“Now, home deliveries and takeaway are open 24 hours. We can work till midnight and there are no time restrictions on Saturdays. Thankfully, the energy-saving limitations were revised in a week,” says Saleem Aleem of All Pakistan Restaurant Associations. “Closing one industry will not save costs when malls, ATMs, street lights and billboards are brightly lit,” he adds.
The hordes of boys that play cards deep into the night while drinking copious amounts of tea and guzzling junk food are not the scion of society that will pay taxes. Nor are the little Pathan boys who serve them part of formal labour. They belong to the shadow economy and hence there is no formal record of the number of dhabbas and roadside cafes in Pakistan.
However, guesstimates put the size of the restaurant sector at about Rs134 billion annually with roughly 75,000 eateries. With many small players fighting to eke out survival on one of the end spectrum, and elite restaurants where a small group of people regularly run up bills in tens of thousands of rupees on the other end, there is not enough clout to sway government policy.
Deemed a luxury and part of everyday life, the restaurant sector was the first and arguable amongst the biggest causalities of the pandemic as much as it appears to be of the recession and the energy crisis.
However, restaurateurs and lovers of food and company are resolute. Driving through Karachi while the ban was in place showed its futility as the posher localities were eerily quiet but family and boy groups traipsed around merrily in the lower-income localities. In some locations, youngsters sat in dim light, continuing their nightly ritual.
Some may think the ban could have helped give a boost to the food delivery business, similar to the lockdown days of the pandemic. However, since the ban extended to deliveries, Foodpanda, while fully supporting effective measures of the government, found the situation ‘quite alarming’.
“Generally, online deliveries reduce energy and ancillary costs significantly since orders are delivered efficiently and stacked across customers,” it said in a written statement, acknowledging that the ban was reversed swiftly. As it is, the worsening economic climate has impacted consumer behaviour who now opt for combined orders as opposed to multiple independent orders to cut down on costs when using the delivery app.
Overall, the impact of restrictions that was borne for a few days had as little a consequence for businesses as for the government’s energy-saving measures.
In an interview with Dawn a few weeks back, National Investment Trust Limited Managing Director Adnan Afridi pointed out the flaws in the government’s decision-making process. “Governments, in general, tend to make the right decisions but too late. The current one is no different and is contributing to the current economic crisis.
“Take the commercial closure at 9pm for example. It is a half-baked measure. The initial proposal that was discussed by the power division was that all commercial feeders be switched off at 7pm which would have been a lot more effective.”
Undoubtedly, the horrifyingly tough economic times require proportionate measures to prevent a default of the economy. However, if measures are to be implemented, they need to do so across the board to have a level playing field for all stakeholders. Policies that are mere optics are little more than nuisances that add to uncertainty and erode away the nearly non-existent confidence that the government (any government of Pakistan) enjoys.

8,Political economy of common good,The road to economic progress and prosperity of the nation’s people lies in a democratic common interest state.,"


 
Both economic growth and state capacities are major issues facing public policies being pursued worldwide. Pakistan is no exception.
After two fiscal years of close to six per cent economic growth, the State Bank of Pakistan sees the economy slowing down to 3-4pc in 2022-23.
Initial market reports show that the textile and technology sectors are shedding labour owing to the economic slowdown. “Some Pakistani exporters have reported cancellation of export orders by foreign buyers in the backdrop of global recession fears,” Fahad Rauf, Head of Research at the Ismail Iqbal Securities was quoted by an analyst on July 13.
“It is going to be a tough 2022 — and possibly an even tougher 2023, with increased risk of recession,” wrote Kristalina Georgieva, the Managing Director of the crisis lender International Monetary Fund (IMF) in a blog published last week ahead of the meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Bali.

Once elected in fair elections, peoples’ representatives must honour the electorate mandate and for this, they have to be accountable to the voters and not someone else

She warned that the global economic outlook has darkened significantly and could deteriorate further, threatening widespread hunger and poverty.
The crude oil (West Texas Intermediate) price fell to $95 per barrel on July 12 compared to around $120 about a month ago. The Shahbaz Sharif government lowered the price of petrol by Rs18.50 and diesel by Rs40.54 last week, mainly because of lower international oil prices.
An opinion piece describes the situation in Pakistan as follows: ”We are faced with a perfect storm. Inadequate investment in education and poor economic growth have generated enormous resentment and anger among a youth cohort that sees few prospects for advancement among contracting employment opportunities.”
In his presentation on ‘State Capacities for Delivering Higher Economic Growth’ at the State Bank in December 2016, distinguished scholar Timothy John Besley said: shore up faltering state capacities (legal, fiscal and collective) for higher growth to reach the final destination of the common interest state.
He further elaborated: What matters is how groups are treated even if they do not have direct access to political power. This requires cohesive political institutions that can promote common interests, guaranteeing the provision of public goods, while a more representative government can increase state capacity.

Street demonstrations or street power is no substitute for empowering the voiceless in taking their own decisions to fend for their livelihood

The common use of the state reduces conflict over resources, leads to more investment in a collective and legal capacity and increases incentives to build fiscal capacity, Mr Besley explained.
In Pakistan, the multiple party Pakistan Democratic Movement supported PML-N’s government and has been described by some as a sort of national unity government. Yet the two major partners, PML-N and PPP, have been unable or unwilling to honour their commitments made to smaller parties.
Neither the governor of Sindh has been appointed by the federal government nor local bodies have been empowered in the provinces as promised. Similarly, the Baloch coalition partners have expressed their disappointment over unmet expected demands.
The Council of Common Interests and the National Finance Commission have not met regularly. In fact, this has been happening for more than a decade despite the roadmap charted out by the 1973 Constitution to build a participatory federal democratic and egalitarian system. Those subscribing to an overcentralised system or monopolisation of power and resource did not allow the Constitution to function smoothly and made governance more cumbersome.
The issue of the common good acquires much more significance because none of the three mainstream parties is a truly federal party. A majority party rule is a thing of the past and coalition governments led by the largest party have become virtually unavoidable both at the federal and sub-federation levels.
With faltering democracy, the issuess of distributive justice and directing national production to meet the needs of the people areare put on the back burner. Much of the time, public policy is focused on export-led growth based on imported inputs financed by unsustainable foreign debt and more frequently repeated IMF bailouts.
The IMF announced on July 14 that a staff-level agreement has been reached with Pakistan which would qualify Islamabad for a tranche of $1.17 billion. It is time now for the Shahbaz government to evolve long-term policies in coordination with the provinces that work for the common good.
The course of persisting structural transformation lies in the organic growth of democracy that works for many and not for few. Once elected in fair elections, peoples’ representatives must honour the electorate mandate and for this, they have to be accountable to the voters and not someone else.
Under citizen-based democracy, the voiceless should have an institutional voice at relevant levels where both the leaders and the masses play an active role in shaping a better future.
In a democracy, as PPP founder chairman Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Bhutto said the people lead and the people are led. What is badly needed is a serious effort to adopt a bottom-up approach to make participatory democracy work for the common good and help push up the economic growth rate. Street demonstrations or street power is no substitute for empowering the voiceless in taking their own decisions to fend for their livelihood.
If critics are to be believed, many of the dominant ideas governing Pakistan have lost their vigour and vitality and yet are being pursued with the same zeal by policymakers as in the past. Successive governments have been either unwilling or unable to overcome the resistance to long overdue structural transformation. The incumbent is not pursuing any different path.
The road to economic progress and prosperity of the nation’s people lies in a democratic common interest state.

Pakistan’s current account, and hence the feeble strength of the rupee, hangs on by a thread that is remittances. Historically, migrant workers from Pakistan head toward Gulf countries. But in 2017 and 2018, the adoption of Gulfisation policies (which aimed at lowering dependence on migrant workers in the labour market) after lowering of oil prices by GCC countries led to a steep drop in emigration. Ironically, in 2019, the year of the first Covid-19 patient, the opening of job opportunities for Pakistani workers in Saudi Arabia led to a spike just before the world shut down and numbers dropped again. Despite fewer emigrants, remittances have had an upward trend in recent years, even during the pandemic when movement was highly restricted. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has to be largely credited since it pushed Pakistan towards anti-money laundering laws that helped move remittances towards official channels instead of hundi and hawala operators. Given the historic levels of the current account deficit and the free fall of the rupee, if the FATF had not pushed the country into formalising remittances, the economy would have been in worst shambles than it currently is.

Poorer than the parents
Americans born between 1981 and 1996, the most educated and most diverse generation in US history, were once considered harbingers of economic progress and promise. But now, even well into their careers, most of them lag behind the financial and familial strides of previous generations. Now, as most millennials have reached their 30s, a point when many of their parents were able to own homes, they have been squeezed between the worst inflation rates of their lifetimes, eye-watering housing prices and the precarious fallout of the pandemic. The Times spoke to more than 30 millennials from around the US about their finances. Their anxieties were palpable and painfully familiar — many of them felt behind, indebted, and unable to live up to the expectations placed upon them. Even those who were doing well were vigilant.

How to lead better virtual meetings
Leading productive meetings is an essential skill for first-time managers. But this can be especially challenging when your team is remote or hybrid. If you find yourself adapting to this situation, here are some strategies: 1) Before the meeting, prepare a detailed agenda and send it to your team to give them time to prepare. 2) During the meeting, check in on everyone. Give people a couple of minutes to catch up or use the time to introduce new team members. As you move through the agenda, make sure that your talking points are clear and actionable. And finally, end the meeting with a concise summary of the next steps. 3) After the meeting, if someone took notes during the meeting, ask that person to email them out to the group. Take some time to privately reflect upon how things went, what you can do to improve in the future, or ask for feedback from your team.

Europe’s winter of discontent
As Vladimir Putin strangles supplies of Russian gas to Europe, the warning signs are flashing red. Gas is a market in which Russia holds the whip hand. Its economy would collapse without oil exports that on average have been worth 10pc of its GDP over the past five years — which is why Russia has gone to extraordinary and largely successful lengths to break the Western crude embargo. But Russia can live without gas exports, which are only 2pc of its GDP. Until a few weeks ago it seemed as if Europe might escape the worst, helped by more LNG cargoes from America and elsewhere. But the big problem now is the flow of gas to Europe from Gazprom, Russia’s gas monopoly. It was already running at about half the normal level and has dropped even further. Because traders think Mr Putin is deliberately squeezing supply, prices for delivery in two winters’ time, in 2023-24, are four times the normal level.

NFT or champagne?
A bottle of champagne with digital tokens attached has sold to a pair of investors for $2.5m, likely breaking the record for the most expensive wine in history.⁠ Entrepreneurs and brothers Giovanni and Piero Buono bought the bottle, a magnum with a 2017 vintage sold by Champagne Avenue Foch, in a private sale. The value of the bottle is less about the bubbly inside and more about the sum of its parts, including the five NFTs (non-fungible tokens) whose images were printed on the outside and the purchase includes a transfer of digital ownership. The images are of cartoon creatures, including a monkey, a bat and a vampire. One is from Bored Ape Yacht Club, a well-known collection of tokens.⁠ “I don’t plan to drink it, I think it will be a good investment,” Mr Giovanni said. “Wealthy people will look for places to store their wealth for a while — and that could be a champagne with an NFT attached to it.”

11,IMF-Funded imported accountability,"It would be no small service to Pakistan if civil servants, cabinet members and parliamentarians are subjected to accountability.","


 
The International Monetary Fund lifeline is finally in sight after months of jittery negotiations. Most of the key conditions have been met, although a few are half complete. The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet has approved a phased increase in electricity rates — one of the crucial outstanding issues — but its ratification was withheld by the Cabinet before formal notification because of Punjab bye-elections.
This week would perhaps clear the policy backlog in the power sector. Gas tariff increase had also been cleared by the ECC last week subject to minor adjustments for the export sector. That too has to pass through the cabinet ratification after elections are over. In both cases, the meter reading and billing cycle can cover up a few days of delayed notification.
Such outstanding issues are precisely the reason for an IMF board meeting tentatively scheduled in the second half of August, almost a month after the Staff Level Agreement (SLA) is announced. Otherwise, 15 days are considered normal for the circulation of relevant papers among the IMF executive board members.
The key Fund programme objectives, nevertheless, remain unchanged. These generally include macroeconomic stabilisation with social protection for the most vulnerable, governance and structural reforms and adequate bilateral and multilateral financing to support the policy effort. The fund would now disburse about $1.18 billion before the close of August to take total disbursements to $4.2bn. The fund programme would extend by nine months to the end of June next year instead of the end of September 2022 and expand in size by $1bn to a total of $7bn.

It would be no small service to Pakistan if senior civil servants, cabinet members and parliamentarians are subjected to transparency and accountability even if it is imposed from abroad

The traditional one-step-forward-two-step back Pakistan approach to Fund programmes has, however, added to the severity of the painful adjustment. For example, former finance minister Shaukat Tarin had committed in January this year a Rs4 per litre increase in petroleum levy on monthly basis to Rs30. Under the revised programme, the levy has to increase by Rs5 per litre every month to a maximum of Rs50. The power tariff increase for last fiscal year was committed at less than Rs5 per unit which has now gone close to Rs8 per litre because of delayed tariff rebasing, on top of monthly fuel pass through, adding burden to the common consumers.

The lagged impact of price adjustments would be no less than a bombshell for the middle class already braving over 20pc rate of inflation — the highest in almost one and half a decade. Nonetheless, the IMF seal of approval along with cash injections would help Pakistan avert, at least for the time being, a default threat and sail through the super cycle of global inflation exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war amid limited foreign exchange reserves enough for less than six weeks of imports. This will facilitate the resumption of loan programmes from multilateral and bilateral lenders alike as all look towards the IMF’s clean chit.
An impression in the meanwhile is being given by certain quarters as if IMF’s demand for the anti-corruption effort was something fresh in the new staff-level agreement and was somehow peculiar to the current political set-up. For a reminder, strengthening of governance and anti-corruption institutions and anti-money laundering push for Financial Action Task Force compliance was very much part of the original agreement finalised by Pakistan and IMF on May 10, 2019, under the 39-month Extended Fund Facility that remained most of the time in limbo since then.
It was promised by then finance minister Dr Hafeez Shaikh that “a task force will review the institutional framework of the anti-corruption institutions to enhance their independence and effectiveness in investigating and prosecuting corruption cases. A study will be conducted on establishing a dedicated anti-money laundering unit in the Federal Investigation Agency” and an assets recovery unit in the prime minister’s office was presented as a key to identifying assets abroad by Pakistani residents.
It was also committed in May 2019 that asset declarations of high-level public officials will be comprehensive in scope (ie, assets with beneficial owners or located abroad), filed with a central federal agency, electronically searchable, and appropriately verified.
Not implemented, the same objectives were tied to an end of June 2020 deadline. Despite the Covid-19 excuse for not honouring the promise, these objectives were made as a structural benchmark of the fund programme in April 2021 (till Dr Shaikh was in office) for the end of June 2021 deadline. With the change of leadership to Shaukat Tarin, the deadline for the structural benchmark was subsequently revised end of January 2022 with stricter conditions including the coverage extending to National Accountability Bureau as well.
Mr Tarin undertook that “to further advance transparency, accountability, and integrity in the public sector, we will issue regulations to establish an electronic asset declaration system (end of June 2021, reset to end of January 2022) that is comprehensive (ie, covering assets beneficially owned or located abroad), centrally-held with the Federal Board of Revenue, covering federal civil servants of Base Pay Scale 17 to 22, accessible to entities authorised by law (including banks for the limited purposes of conducting customer due diligence as required for the provision of banking services), and effectively verified. It will also institutionalise public access for annual declarations for all members (elected and unelected) of the federal government cabinet of Pakistan.”
While the IMF certificate will facilitate about $28bn in total international inflows during the current fiscal year to help meet about $41bn in international financial obligations, it would be no mean service to the Pakistani nation if senior civil servants, cabinet members and parliamentarians are subjected to transparency and accountability even if it is imposed from abroad. Such a development may, otherwise, remain a pipedream for Pakistanis to achieve by themselves for decades.

12,Recession would make tough oil sanctions on Russia more likely,"So far, sanctions on Russia’s petroleum exports have driven up prices for consuming countries, while boosting its earnings.","RECESSION in the major economies is the only surefire way to reduce Russia’s petroleum revenues, an uncomfortable truth Western policymakers have tried to obfuscate from voters at home.
US and EU policymakers will not deliberately plunge their economies into a recession simply to intensify the economic pressure on Russia; privation is not an attractive option in electoral politics.
But if their economies go into recession anyway, which currently appears possible or even probable, the likelihood of tough sanctions on Russia’s oil exports will increase significantly later this year and in 2023.
Russia was the world’s second-largest oil producer in 2021, with an output of 536 million tonnes, behind the United States with an output of 711m tonnes, but just ahead of Saudi Arabia on 515m tonnes.

So far, sanctions on Russia’s petroleum exports have driven up prices for consuming countries, while boosting its earnings because prices have risen faster than volumes

On a mass basis, Russia accounted for nearly 13 per cent of worldwide production, behind the United States (17pc) but marginally ahead of Saudi Arabia (12pc), according to BP (Statistical review of world energy, July 2022).
Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf monarchies and US shale firms appear to be producing close to their current limits, with few options to raise output in the short term. None of these producers seems both able and willing to make up for any loss of crude and refined fuel exports from Russia, in any significant volume, despite the recent surge in prices.
In the absence of a recession, the marginal barrel in the oil market is therefore from Russia, and the terms on which it is made available to international buyers in the Middle East and Asia set the global price. So far, sanctions on Russia’s petroleum exports have driven up prices for consuming countries, while boosting Russia’s earnings because prices have risen faster than volumes have fallen.
But recession or a prolonged business cycle downturn in the major oil-consuming economies of the United States, the European Union and China would change the situation by creating spare capacity in the oil market.
The marginal price-setting barrel would no longer be exclusively from Russia; Saudi Arabia, the rest of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and US shale producers would all be competing to supply stagnating or shrinking consumption.
Self-sanctioning
Until now, sanctions have hurt consumers more than they have punished Russia, with the European Union and the United States headed towards a business cycle downturn in large part because of high energy and other commodity prices.
The European Union, in particular, appears to have sanctioned itself close to a recession as soaring prices for oil, gas and electricity, as well as food products and manufactured items, squeeze household and business spending.
This should not have come as a surprise to policymakers with a sense of history. Four centuries of experience shows that energy embargoes increase prices paid by consumers significantly in the short and medium term unless there are alternative supplies readily available to make up the deficit.
Energy boycotts are an attractive policy instrument if and only if there is excess production capacity (actual or potential) that allows energy from sanctioned sources to be replaced by non-sanctioned ones. Sanctions on Russia’s oil have boomeranged on consumers the same way they did when the English parliament banned coal shipments into London from royalist coal-producing areas in 1642-43 during the civil war.
The same problem was evident when international oil companies embargoed fuel shipments from Iran between 1951 and 1954 following the nationalisation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, causing fuel shortages in Asia.
Recession calculus
A recession or a business cycle downturn would change the circumstances and make it possible, at least in principle, to replace Russia’s petroleum exports with more barrels from other suppliers.
The recession and the emergence of more spare capacity would also lead to lower prices for all producers, including Russia.
In a recession, Russia’s revenues would be hit doubly hard by the combination of lower prices and lower volumes as its barrels were replaced by barrels from other producers.
Understandably, senior US and EU policymakers are not keen to engineer a deliberate recession to make sanctions more effective.
Complicated proposals for a price cap on Russia’s oil sales are an attempt to evade this dilemma, or at least hide the policy trade-offs.
But if an unintended recession occurs in the next few months, it could create more space to toughen sanctions policies later in 2022 and 2023.
Re-emergence of spare capacity would make the replacement of Russian oil practical while lower prices would mask the cost of sanctions for consumers and make them more politically acceptable to voters. With all producers hit by the simultaneous downturn in sales volumes and prices, there might be more interest in displacing Russian barrels from rivals, potentially weakening solidarity within the OPEC+ group.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Western sanctions on Russia’s oil exports and the outlook for the global economic cycle have become inextricably linked.
