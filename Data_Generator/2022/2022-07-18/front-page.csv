0,"US terms Imran’s claim disturbing, looks ahead to strong ties",State Department official describes US-Pakis­tan relations as “a partnership we cannot do without”.,"WASHINGTON: Former prime minister Imran Khan’s conspiracy claims are ‘very disturbing,’ says a US State Department official while underlining Wash­ington’s desire to rebuild a strong partnership with Pakistan.
Addressing a convention of Pakistani physicians in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Director Pakistan Desk Neil W. Hop described US-Pakis­tan relations as “a partnership we cannot do without”.
“We have to work with Pakistan in tackling global affairs. It is a partnership that is essential for us,” he said.
Mr Hop said that a Paki­stani delegation would visit Washington on July 25 for the largest ever health talks between the two countries.
Pakistan’s Ambassador Masood Khan said that the US-Pakistan relations had already stabilised and were “poised to become even better” in the near future. 
A former Pakistani ambassador to the US, Jalil Abbas Jilani, however, acknowledged that relations were passing through a difficult phase and suggested “the revival of structured high-level dialogue” to keep the partnership on track.
Ambassador Khan suggested strong commercial ties between the two countries, reminding American investors that “Pakistan has a large and vibrant Middle class and offers great opportunities for investment.”
Responding to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s claim of alleged US interference in Pakistan’s domestic politics, Hop said: “It’s very disturbing. There’s absolutely no truth in those allegations. We support a strong, democratic setup in Pakistan. We have no interests in its domestic politics.”
Jilani said the entire episode was very tragic, adding that he has had personal relations with the US official, Donald Lu, implicated in this alleged conspiracy. “He has positive feelings for Pakistan and has rejected involvement in any conspiracy,” he said.
Hop too called Lu a thorough “professional who cannot make such statements.”
Jilani suggested tackling this and other similar issues “in a discreet and dispassionate fashion”.

1,Railways paying Rs35bn pension to unverified employees,"Report says PR incurring losses for 35 years due to competition from road transport, inability to adopt customer-centric bus.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) — a state-owned think tank working under the Planning Commission — has found that 115,000 unverified retired employees of Pakistan Railways are being paid Rs35 billion in annual pension. 
In a statement issued on Sunday, PIDE said its study showed that Railways losses amounted to a prodigious Rs144bn during the five years from 2015 to 2020.
The PIDE report recommended radical institutional reforms in Pakistan Railways, as it currently ranked among the top ten loss-making state-owned enterprises in Pakistan.
The losses included a Rs44bn deficit reported in 2020, including Rs36bn pension liability on Railways for 120,000 employees. To overcome the deficit and pension liability, a Rs45bn subsidy was provided by the government during that year, the report said.

Report says PR incurring losses for 35 years due to stiff competition from road transport, inability to adopt customer-centric business

“The stiff competition from road transport and the inability of PR to adopt a customer-centric business plan because of complex bureaucratic structure has led to an inefficient, underfinanced and overstaffed public agency running in losses for the last three and a half decades,” it said.
“Additionally, there are 115,000 unverified retirees of PR, who are paid Rs35bn annually,” the report said.
To verify these individuals, a biometric verification system for the pensioners has been proposed. The pension deficit has been fielded by the government for Pakistan Railways. A pay and pension commission has been formed, which will have to think about not only railways but other public enterprises as well.
Furthermore, the Pakistan Railways owns 178,000 acres, of which 145,000 are being used for operational purposes and the remaining 33,000 are the “right of way” entitled to the Pakistan Railways.
This land is both underpriced and underpaid as the rents are concerned. Two options can be exercised to put this ancillary land in use.
Around Rs5-10bn can be generated annually by rewriting the concession agreements and getting rid of the encroaches or by transforming railway stations in big cities like Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad into commercial hubs along the lines of Delhi Metro with decent shopping plazas, cafes and restaurants.
Placed in the “retain and restructure” category after the state-owned firms’ triage exercise in March 2021, the 19th-century infrastructure of Pakistan Railways still grapples with the challenges of the 21st century after several repeated rounds of half-hearted reforms.
The report said half of the ticketing was now electronic, but Pakistan Railways still lacked an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system which integrates all the processes. “Even the flow of financial information within the enterprise reports a delay of 60 days,” it said.
It also recommended that customer relationship management (CRM) systems should be created for the customer relationship, including tracking arrangements, call centres, SMS alerts, etc.
It added that the Railways Automated Booking and Travel Assistance (Rabta) had been advertised and automation was expected to address the leakages which had been the major reason behind the decline in the volume of PR freight in 2020-21.
The report also stressed the need to understand how individuals think and decide to make human resources more productive.
This would require going beyond the “rationality” assumption and expanding the set of tools and strategies Pakistan Railways can think of via behavioural economics.
The losses incurred by Railways could be reframed, so they were more obvious to all levels of employees, such as in terms of the declined health and education facilities for workers’ families, it said. Besides, the cost of subsidies provided by the government can be highlighted in terms of the number of children outside school or poverty relief that the government provides.

2,PTI stuns PML-N with thumping win,"• Imran calls for general election under ‘credible ECP’
• Maryam accepts her party’s defeat
• 15 seats ...","• Imran calls for general election under ‘credible ECP’
• Maryam accepts her party’s defeat
• 15 seats go to PTI, four to PML-N
LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf on Sunday routed the PML-N by winning at least 15 seats in the crucial by-elections on 20 seats that got vacated after the disqualification of PTI members who had voted for Hamza Shehbaz for Punjab chief minister’s office.
As per unofficial results, PTI won five seats in central Punjab, five in north and as many in south Punjab. Imran Khan’s party lost one seat in Lahore, three in south Punjab and one in north in the by-elections held in 14 districts of the province.
Meanwhile, the ruling PML-N could win only four seats, as it had fielded turncoats in all the constituencies, except one of Lahore, where PTI renegade Aleem Khan had decided against contesting the by-election.
PTI chairman Imran Khan in a tweet thanked party workers and voters of Punjab for defeating, what he called, not just PML-N candidates, but the entire state machinery, especially harassment by police and a “totally biased” Election Commission of Pakistan.
He also thanked the PTI allies — PML-Q, Majlis-i-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) and Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC).
“The only way forward from here is to hold fair and free elections under a credible ECP. Any other path will only lead to greater political uncertainty and further economic chaos,” Mr Khan said.

 





 
As the electoral scoreboard got clearer, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz tweeted that her party should accept the results with an open heart and bow before people’s decision, adding that winning and losing is part of politics. She also advised her party to identify its weaknesses and work hard to remove the same.

 





 
PTI leaders, including former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry, welcomed Maryam’s comment and asserted that Hamza Shehbaz should immediately resign as he had lost the mandate.
Fawad said Imran Khan was the only decisive factor between the rival parties as he ran a whirlwind election campaign and hammered home his narrative by asking voters to wage “jihad” by defeating turncoats and attain “real independence”. He also tweeted an Urdu couplet ‘ye waqt kis ki raoonat pe khak daal gya / ye kon bol rha tha khuda ke lehjey mein’.

 





 
The by-polls were largely held in a peaceful manner, except for sporadic brawls, harsh sloganeering, allegations and counter-allegations at some polling stations.
As the polling concluded at the scheduled time of 5pm, both the PTI and PML-N leaders declared the polling process remained peacefully in the province. PML-N’s home minister Attaullah Tarar also said no serious law and order situation was reported.
Fawad said people had come out of their homes in droves to ensure Pakistan got “real independence from the rule of foreign masters”.
Stating that the polling held in a peaceful manner, Mr Khan after the polling pointed to a clash in Lahore, arrest of Shahbaz Gill in Muzaffargarh and police’s attempt to arrest PTI’s former ministers Shibli Faraz and Zulfi Bukhari.
Explainer: Why the by-polls in Punjab are so important
The PTI’s winning candidates and their constituencies include Hassan Malik (PP-83, Khushab-II); Irfan Ullah Khan Niazi (PP-90, Bhakkar-II); Ali Afzal Sahi (PP-97, Faisalabad-I); Mian Muhammad Azam (PP-125, Jhang-II); Mehr Muhammad Nawaz (PP-127, Jhang-IV); Khurram Shehzad Virk (PP-140, Sheikhupura-VI); Mian Muhammad Akram Usman (PP-158, Lahore-XV); Shabbir Ahmad Gujjar (PP-167, Lahore-XXIV); Malik Zaheer Abbas Khokhar (PP-170, Lahore-XXVI); Muhammad Ghulam Sarwar (PP-202, Sahiwal-VII); Makhdoom Zain Hussain Qureshi (PP-217, Multan-VII); Muhammad Aamir Iqbal Shah (PP-224, Lodhran-I) and Muhammad Moazzam Ali Khan (PP-272, Muzaffargarh-V).
The winning PML-N candidates are Raja Saghir Ahmed (PP-07, Rawalpindi-II); Malik Asad Ali Khokhar (PP-168, Lahore-XXV); Fida Hussain (PP-237, Bahawalnagar-I) and Muhammad Sibtain Raza (PP-273, Muzaffargarh-VI).
Only independent candidate Syed Muhammad Rafiuddin Bukhari won from PP-228 (Lodhran-V) constituency.
The PTI leaders are of the view that the people in Punjab had vented their anger at the “imported government” accepting the party chairman Imran Khan’s narrative that the turncoats sold their conscience for money and they must be defeated.
The PTI’s victory and resignations by some party dissidents has not only posed a serious threat to the Hamza Shehbaz government in Punjab, but also a potential challenge to the Shehbaz Sharif’s government in the Centre.
Commenting on PTI’s landslide victory, former PML-Q federal minister Moonis Elahi tweeted that PML-N’s defeat was actually Pakistan’s victory. He stated Punjab had come out of Sharif family’s slavery by breaking all shackles.
“The real process of change will begin now and Punjab as well as Pakistan will progress leaps and bounds under the leadership of Imran Khan,” he asserted.

3,A bitter taste of unpopular decisions,Those keenly watching the political situation say the rising inflation graph cost the PML-N more than Imran’s narrative.,"LAHORE: The ‘unexpected’ sweeping victory of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in the all-important Punjab by-polls is set to influence the political as well as economic future of the country. 
The result establishes that the voters didn’t like the unpopular decisions of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz both on economic and political fronts: allowing the inflationary trend to continue to ward off economic meltdown and giving its tickets to PTI ‘turncoats’. 
The outcome of the by-elections to 20 seats of the Punjab Assembly held in a largely peaceful manner on Sunday has not just sealed the fate of Hamza Shehbaz’s government in Punjab but also sent alarm bells ringing for Shehbaz Sharif’s federal government. The PTI-PML-Q alliance has improved its tally from 173 before the by-election and crossed the magical number of 186 to form its government in the province.  
All the seats the PTI claimed on July 17 either directly belonged to the party or were won by the independents who later joined it during the government formation process. Imran Khan led a vigorous campaign against those who had ditched the party during the first poll for chief minister on April 16 and voted for Hamza. He has also been targeting the Establishment for not siding with him in foiling the ‘conspiracy’ the PML-N, PPP and other parties had hatched “with the help of the United States” to dethrone him. 
However, those keenly watching the political situation say the rising inflation graph cost the PML-N more than Khan’s narrative. Inflation, which had been a drawback of the PTI government and had been repeatedly targeted by then opposition PML-N, came to haunt the latter when it took the reins of the country in April. 
“People had hoped that the PML-N government would provide them relief from the ‘wrong’ economic decisions taken by the PTI government. But, instead, the Shehbaz government aggravated their economic affliction by blindly following the IMF,” says Dr Amjad Magsi of the South Asia Study Centre of the Punjab University. 
“The present rulers popularised Imran Khan’s narrative by taking the anti-masses, unpopular decisions and that too after weeks of confusion and reluctance that accelerated the economic meltdown. Politically, it was more suited for them to go for new elections soon after Khan’s ouster from power rather than owning the unpopular decisions of the last PTI government,” he explains. 
Senior columnist Imtiaz Alam says the deteriorating economic conditions have played a role in setting the mood of the voters but it is mainly a verdict against the turncoats whom the PML-N embraced. 
Dr Magsi says unlike the PTI which was clear in its target, there was a confusion and division in the PML-N ranks about the backing of the former PTI MPAs given party tickets for the by-polls. 
Sensing this division and mobilising its cadre, the PML-N high command had warned that the district and divisional leaderships would be shown the door in case of defeat in their respective areas. 
The victory for the PTI in what is traditionally known as the PML-N citadel -- Lahore -- and other central Punjab urban centres is shocking for many. 
Prof Rashid Ahmed Khan says the impact of the by-polls result will not remain confined to Punjab only but it will spill over and adversely affect the Shehbaz government in Islamabad. “With three provinces out of control of Islamabad and the fourth, Sindh, in the grip of ally PPP, the central government will have very limited space to work. It may not sustain pressure for long from three anti-centre provincial governments and will have to bow out of the power corridors. Particularly if the three provincial assemblies are dissolved, the general election will become inevitable,” he says. 
Observers had been expecting that Punjab Assembly Speaker Parvez Elahi, who is a joint candidate of the PTI and PML-Q for the re-poll for CM’s office, would be reluctant to dissolve the assembly and try to convince Imran Khan to prolong their stay in power in the province to further deal a blow to the PML-N through state resources. But, he told a private TV channel late in the night that he (after becoming the CM) would dissolve the assembly minutes after a direction from Imran Khan. 
A senior PML-N leader, who requested not to be named, says the local political instability will create trouble on the foreign front as even friendly countries will be reluctant to come forward and extend their assistance to an ‘unstable government’ facing financial crunch. 
To prevent further chaos in the country, Mr Alam suggests that Hamza should accept defeat and immediately resign as chief minister, while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif convene an all-party conference and a session of parliament to decide the schedule for general election. 
“Let a caretaker government be formed to preside over the power transition,” he says.

4,PTI jubilant as PML-N calls for introspection,"Asad Umar asks PM Shehbaz to call snap elections, says Imran has called a meeting today to decide future strategy.","ISLAMABAD: The Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) appeared confident of a landslide victory in the by-elections on 20 Punjab Asse­mbly seats in  light of initial results on Sunday, as its senior leader Asad Umar congratulated party supporters who “rejected the decisions made behind closed doors” through their ballots. 
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice President Maryam Nawaz,  on the other hand, called for introspection following the defeat of the ruling PML-N in its political heartland. 
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the PTI secretary  general urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to call snap elections.  After the defeat in the Punjab by-elections and imminent ouster of Hamza  Shehbaz as the Punjab CM on July 22, Mr Sharif would be reduced to the  “prime minister of Islamabad”, he added.  
On July 22, PML-Q leader Parvez Elahi will become the chief  minister of Punjab, Mr Umar said, calling the election a mere formality.   
Mr Umar claimed that as per the initial results, the PTI was  likely to win 16 or 17 seats out of the 20 provincial assembly seats up  for grabs in the by-election. The likely victory of the PTI proved that  the people of Pakistan had rejected the “decisions taken behind closed  doors”, he added.   
Mr Umar said the PTI chairman had called a meeting of the core  committee on Monday (today) where decisions will be taken regarding the  future strategy. 
‘Time for introspection’ 
As unofficial results started pouring in showing the PTI in  the lead, the PML-N vice president took to Twitter and said that the  “defeat should be accepted with an open heart”. “The PML-N should take  the results of the by-polls with an open heart and accept the  decision of the masses,” Maryam Nawaz tweeted. She added that winning  and losing was part of politics; therefore, the party should now focus  on its weaknesses, identify them, and then overcome them. 
“God willing, everything will be fine,” she assured her supporters. 

 





 
Similarly, PML-N senior leader Malik Mohammad Ahmed Khan also  accepted that PTI had clinched a “landslide victory” in the  hotly-contested by-polls. “I accept that PTI has won and the party  wholeheartedly accepts the verdict of the public,” he said. He further  added that everybody can get into the debate of how and what happened,  but “apparently current circumstances show that PTI has won the  elections therefore, we congratulate them and accept our defeat.” 
Imran lauds supporters 
Earlier in the day, PTI Chairman Imran Khan lauded his supporters for coming out to cast their vote in large numbers despite alleged harassment by the “state apparatus at the  behest of the PML-N”. 
“I am pleased to see our voters coming out to cast their votes in  large numbers and resisting all pressures and harassment,” Mr Khan said  as he posted a series of tweets about the by-polls throughout the day.   “I want all those, especially our women, who have to still come out to  cast their vote to do so as this is an election for Pakistan’s  sovereignty and Haqeeqi Azadi (real independence),” the PTI chairman added. 

 





 
In another tweet, the former prime minister, who was ousted  through a no-confidence motion in April, alleged that the Punjab  government was using state  machinery to rig elections and harass the PTI voters. 
“Today Punjab govt has brazenly violated SC orders and election  rules by openly using all govt/State machinery to rig Punjab elections  through illegal ballot stamping and harassing voters while arresting PTI  leaders,” Mr Khan said, alleging the Election Commission of Pakistan  (ECP) had turned a blind eye to these irregularities. He urged courts to and act against the alleged rigging. 

 





 
“Courts must open now and act,” his tweet read. 
The PTI chief was referring to the arrest of his aide Shahbaz Gill, who was arrested in Muzaffargarh for allegedly carrying and  displaying weapons on his visit to polling stations PP-272 and PP-73  during the by-elections. According to Mr Khan, his aide was arrested to  instill fear. He vowed that these tactics would not work and  urged “handlers of the imported government” to realise the damage they  were doing to the nation.
