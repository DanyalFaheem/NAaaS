0,Sudan forces fire tear gas at protesters; tribal clashes escalate,Khartoum has been scene of near-weekly protests since army chief al-Burhan launched power grab in October last year.,"KHARTOUM: Police fired tear gas in Sudan’s capital Khartoum on Sunday against hundreds of anti-coup protesters who also called attention to increasingly deadly tribal clashes in the country’s south.
The capital has been the scene of near-weekly protests since army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan launched a power grab in October last year that derailed a transition to civilian rule.
The coup saw key donors pull the plug on funding, exacerbating a long-running economic crisis and feeding into inter-communal unrest in remote parts of the country.
Blue Nile state, bordering Ethiopia, is the latest crucible of tribal clashes — and on Sunday, authorities there raised the death toll to 60, from 33 the previous day, in fighting that began nearly a week ago.
“Al-Damazin is bleeding,” read a sign held up by a Khartoum protester, referring to the provincial capital of Blue Nile.
Other demonstrators in the capital chanted:  “Sudan is one nation” and  “No to racism, no to tribalism.” In the city of Wad Madani, some 200 kilometres (around 125 miles) south of Khartoum, protesters diverted their demonstration to the local hospital to  “donate blood to our brothers wounded in tribal clashes in Blue Nile”, protest organiser Ammar Mohammed said.
The clashes in Blue Nile state, between the Berti and Hawsa tribes, first erupted last Monday. The violence came after the Berti tribe rejected a Hawsa request to create a  “civil authority to supervise access to land”, a prominent Hawsa said.
But a senior member of the Bertis had said the tribe was responding to a  “violation” of its lands by the Hawsas.
Dozens of Hawsas blocked the western entrance to the western city of Kassala with burning tyres and stones  “in solidarity with our people in the (Blue) Nile, to stop their murder and displacement”, said protester Mohammed Abkar.
The revised death toll of 60 was provided by Blue Nile health minister Jamal Nasser, who also said that 163 people have been wounded.
“Violence is never a solution,” Unicef tweeted Sunday, in a country where the UN estimates half the population will be pushed into extreme hunger by September.
The Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North, the main armed faction in Blue Nile, denied Sunday any involvement in the clashes.
Pro-democracy demonstrators accuse Sudan’s military leadership and ex-rebel leaders who signed a 2020 peace deal of exacerbating ethnic tensions in Blue Nile for personal gain.
Security forces had erec­ted road blocks on bridges crossing the Nile linking Khartoum to its suburbs, reporters said, to deter protesters who vowed to take to the streets in large numbers to protest against Burhan.
Sudan’s latest coup sparked regular protests and an ongoing crackdown by security forces that has killed at least 114, according to pro-democracy medics.
Nine were killed on June 30, the medics said, when tens of thousands gathered against the military. Early this month, Burhan vowed in a surprise move to make way for a civilian government. But the country’s main civilian umbrella group rejected his move as a  “ruse” and protesters have continued to press the army chief to resign.
The rallies on Sunday follow a period of relative calm in Khartoum in recent days.
Experts say last year’s coup created a security vacuum that has fostered a resurgence in tribal violence, in a country where deadly clashes regularly erupt over land, livestock, access to water and grazing.
Guerrillas in Blue Nile battled former strongman president Omar al-Bashir during Sudan’s 1983-2005 civil war, picking up weapons again in 2011.
Prompted by enormous protests against his rule, the army ousted Bashir in 2019.
The following year, a civilian-military power-sharing government reached a peace deal with key rebel groups, including from Blue Nile as well as the war-ravaged western Darfur region.
Both areas remain underdeveloped and awash with weapons and there has also been an increase in violence in Darfur in recent months.

1,Forest fires rage in scorching south-west Europe,"Heatwave shows no sign of abating, with Britain poised to set new temperature records this coming week.","MADRID: Firefighters struggled to contain wildfires sweeping across southwest Europe on Sunday as a heatwave showed no sign of abating, with Britain poised to set new temperature records this coming week.
Blazes raging in France, Greece, Portugal and Spain have destroyed thousands of hectares of land, forced thousands of residents and holidaymakers to flee and killed several emergency personnel since last week.
It is the second heatwave to engulf parts of southwest Europe in weeks.
Scientists blame climate change and predict more frequent and intense episodes of extreme weather such as heatwaves and drought.
Firefighters in France’s southwestern Gironde region were fighting to control two forest blazes that have devoured nearly 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres) since Tuesday.
The wildfires have forced more than 14,000 people — residents and tourists combined — to decamp. Seven emergency shelters have been set up to take in evacuees.
Meteo France forecast temperatures of up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of southern France on Sunday, with new heat records expected on Monday.
“The heat is intensifying. The heatwave is spreading across the country,” the weather office said.
France placed 15 departments, mainly down its western seaboard, on red alert — the highest on the scale — on Sunday while 51 were on orange high alert.
The neighbouring chapel of a historic hospital in the southeastern city of Lyon, Grand Hotel Dieu, offered refuge to tourists on Sunday including Jean-Marc, 51, who was visiting from Alsace.
“We came back to admire the place but we can’t leave, it’s too hot outside. We say a prayer before the fire!” he quipped.
Authorities in the French Alps urged climbers bound for Mont Blanc, Europe’s highest mountain, to postpone their trip due to repeated rock falls caused by  “exceptional climatic conditions” and  “drought”.
The call comes after a section of Italy’s biggest Alpine glacier gave way at the start of the month, killing 11 people — a disaster officials blamed on climate change.
Spanish authorities reported around 20 wildfires still raging out of control in different parts of the country from the south to Galicia in the far northwest, where blazes have destroyed around 4,500 hectares of land.
Another fire burning in the Mijas mountain range inland from the southern coastal city of Malaga has so far destroyed about 2,000 hectares of land, local officials said.
The fire forced the evacuation of just over 3,000 people but around 2,000 people have since been allowed to return to their homes.
Firefighters, backed by 18 water-dropping planes, said the steep terrain of the area combined with strong winds and low humidity levels were complicating their battle against the blaze.
“We didn’t stop working all night,” regional agriculture minister Carmen Crespo told Spanish public television of efforts to quench the flames.
Spain’s national weather office, AEMET, forecast  “significantly high” temperatures for most of mainland Spain and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean on Sunday.
The eastern town of Don Benito recorded Spain’s highest temperature on Sunday, with the mercury hitting 43.4C.
A 60-year-old street cleaner in Madrid died on Saturday after suffering heat stroke while working the previous day, local officials said.
The fight against the flames has also claimed the lives of a number of emergency personnel, including a pilot killed when his plane crashed in northern Portugal and two who died in Greece when their helicopter fell into the sea.
In Portugal, almost the entire country remained on high alert for wildfires despite a slight drop in temperatures, after hitting 47C — a record for the month of July — on Thursday. Only one major fire was burning on Sunday in the north.
The fires have killed two, injured around 60 and destroyed between 12,000 and 15,000 hectares of land in Portugal.
In Greece, the civil defence service had brought a wildfire raging on the Mediterranean island of Crete since Friday under control. In the United Kingdom, the weather office issued a first-ever  “red” warning for extreme heat, cautioning there was a  “risk to life”.
The Met Office said temperatures in southern England could exceed 40C on Monday or Tuesday for the first time, leading some schools to say they would stay closed next week.
London Mayor Sadiq Khan advised people in the capital to use public transport only if  “absolutely necessary”. National train operators also warned passengers to avoid travel.
Organisers of a four-day march in the Netherlands cancelled the first day of the mass event due to start on Tuesday because of extreme heat.
The mercury is set to reach 38C in parts of the Netherlands on Tuesday.

2,Several arrested in Iran after protests over drying lake,"Lake Urmia began shrinking in 1995 due to prolonged drought, extraction of water for farming and dams, says UN.","TEHRAN: Iranian  police have arrested several people for disturbing security after they  protested the drying up of a lake once regarded as the Middle East’s  largest, official media said on Sunday.
Lake Urmia, in the mountains  of northwest Iran, began shrinking in 1995 due to a combination of  prolonged drought, and the extraction of water for farming and dams,  according to the UN Environment Programme.
Urmia, one of the  largest  “hypersaline” — or super salty — lakes in the world, is  located between the cities of Tabriz and Urmia, with more than six  million people dependent on agriculture around its shores.
On Sunday, Rahim Jahanbakhsh, the police chief of Iran’s West Azerbaijan province, reported the arrests.
He  described the suspects as  “many evil and hostile elements, who had no  other objective than to destroy public property and disturb the security  of the population,” according to state news agency IRNA.
On  Saturday, the Fars news agency reported that  “dozens of people in the  cities of Naghadeh and Urmia had protested against the authorities’ lack  of attention to the drying up of Lake Urmia”.
Fars said protesters had shouted slogans in the provincial capital of Urmia warning the lake was shrinking.
“Lake  Urmia is dying, parliament orders its killing”, some shouted, Fars  reported, with others calling out that  “Lake Urmia is thirsty”.
Largely  arid Iran, like other nearby countries, has suffered chronic dry spells  and heat waves for years, which are expected to worsen with the impacts  of climate change.
In the last few months, thousands of people  have demonstrated against the drying up of rivers, particularly in  central and southwestern Iran.
Lake Urmia is an important  ecosystems, a key stopping point for migratory birds, and home to an  endemic shrimp as well as other underwater species.
2,200 convicts pardoned
Iran’s supreme leader has pardoned or commuted the sentences of more than 2,200 prisoners, including some on death row, to mark two important Muslim feasts, official sources said on Sunday.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  “granted pardons or commuted the sentences of 2,272 convicts” for the Eidul Azha and Ghadir religious holidays, which both fall this month, a statement on his website said.
The supreme leader routinely grants collective pardons on major religious occasions, in coordination with the head of the judiciary.
The judiciary’s website, Mizan Online, said 43 of the prisoners had been sentenced to death.

3,Macron marks 80th anniversary of  Jews’ round-up,Calls for redoubled vigilance against the growing anti-Semitism in the country.,"PITHIVIERS: French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday marked the 80th anniversary of the wartime round-up of Jews in France by calling for redoubled vigilance against the growing anti-Semitism in the country.
Macron delivered his speech at the former railway station in Pithiviers, 100 kilometres south of Paris, where 8,100 French Jews, including 4,400 children, were deported to Auschwitz.
Also attending the ceremony were some of the few survivors of those deported on the convoys sent to the Nazi camp.
“Eight decades ago, Vichy France betrayed these children by delivering thousands of them to their executioners,” said Macron, referring to the French wartime regime that collaborated with the Nazi occupiers.
“It is the duty of France, to be true to itself, to recognise this and to concede nothing to this contemporary fight against anti-Semitism.” On July 16 and 17, French police rounded up 13,000 Jews in Paris and its suburbs on the orders of the Nazis.
The incident has become known as the Vel d’Hiv round-ups because many of those arrested, including the elderly and sick, were initially held at the Velodrome d’Hiver, a cycle racing track in Paris’s 15th arrondissement.
From there, they were taken to camps at Pithiviers and other locations then onto the Nazi concentration camps. Only a few dozen ever returned.
“We are not done with antisemitism, and we must make a lucid assessment of it,” said Macron.
“This anti-Semitism is even more burning, rampant, than it was in 1995, in our country, in Europe, and in so many places in the world,” he stressed.
Macron was referring back to the words of one of his predecessors Jacques Chirac, who in 1995 acknowledged France’s responsibility for the Vel d’Hiv round ups.
“These dark hours stain our history forever,” said Chirac in a landmark speech.  “On that day, France accomplished the irreparable”.
After Chirac, Francois Hollande went further during his presidency, speaking in a 2012 speech of a crime  “committed in France, by France”.
Then in 2017 Macron, newly elected as president, reaffirmed France’s responsibility for the round-up in a speech marking its 75th anniversary and in the presence of then Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu.
But Macron was himself criticised for saying in 2018 that France’s Philippe Petain, who headed the Vichy regime, had been a  “great soldier” during World War I, even if he had subsequently made  “fatal choices”.

4,"Over 1,000 mayors plead with Italy’s PM to stay","Sign petition urging PM to rethink his resignation and steer the country throug choppy waters of inflation, EU reforms and war.","ROME: More than 1,000 Italian mayors signed a petition on Sunday urging Prime Minister Mario Draghi to rethink his resignation and steer the country through the choppy waters of rampant inflation, EU reforms and war.
“The government must continue”, said the petition, which was signed by mayors from Florence to Rome and Venice.
Draghi offered his resignation to Italy’s president on Thursday — but was asked to take time to sound out whether it was possible to carry on with the current government until the general election early next year.
He is expected to address parliament on Wednesday, either to lay out his plan for keeping the government alive or to repeat his belief that his only option is to resign at the helm of the eurozone’s third largest economy.
The mayors’ petition slammed the  “irresponsible behaviour” of Five Star Movement, a member of the ruling coalition that sat out a confidence vote last week, a move Draghi had warned would bring down the government.
Ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi and far-right leader Matteo Salvini, both of whom have parties in Draghi’s coalition, said Sunday they could no longer govern with Five Star, due to its  “incompetence and unreliability”.
Berlusconi and Salvini are both  “ready” to go to the polls  “even very shortly”, if necessary, their joint statement said.
The mayors said they were watching events unfold  “with disbelief and concern”.
“Our cities... cannot afford a crisis today that means immobilism and division, where action, credibility, seriousness are now needed,” the petition said.
The post-pandemic recovery and social emergency mean  “now, more than ever, we need stability, certainty and consistency in order to continue the transformation of our cities.
“Because without the rebirth of these, Italy will not be reborn either,” it said.

5,Congolese intelligence agents detain US journalist Stavros Nicolas Niarchos,"Action taken after journalist allegedly approached armed groups in the country’s southeast, says official.","KINSHASA: The Democratic Republic of Congo’s intelligence service has detained US journalist Stavros Nicolas Niarchos after he allegedly approached armed groups in the country’s southeast, a senior government official said on Sunday.
Local civil-society groups such as RECN quoted in local media said that Niarchos and a Congolese journalist were arrested in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi on Wednesday and taken to the capital Kinshasa.
A senior government official confirmed on Sunday that the Congolese intelligence agency ANR is holding Niarchos in Kinshasa.
The 33-year-old journalist, who writes for US magazines The Nation and The New Yorker, had made contact with armed groups including the Bakata Katanga militia, the official said.
“He made movements that were never previously reported to the authorities,” the official explained, noting that the government  “must be vigilant” after the murder of two United Nations experts in 2017.
The UN had hired experts American Michael Sharp and Swedish-Chilean Zaida Catalan to probe violence in the Kasai region of central DRC, where they were kidnapped and killed.
“The Congolese authorities have no interest in keeping an American journalist,” the senior government official said, adding that he may be released on Tuesday.
Niarchos travelled to the DRC to report on nature conservation, the economy and culture for The Nation magazine, according to the journalist’s official accreditation.

6,Iraq’s date palms: rescuing a national icon,"KARBALA: Thousands of young date palms, Iraq’s national symbol, form lines that extend from the edge of the desert...","KARBALA: Thousands of young date palms, Iraq’s national symbol, form lines that extend from the edge of the desert near the central city of Karbala and into the horizon.
Iraq’s prized trees are central to a push aimed to preserve a long-threatened ancestral culture, whose fruit historically presented prosperity across the Arab world.
“The date palm is the symbol and pride of Iraq,” says Mohamed Abul-Maali, commercial director at the Fadak date plantation.
Once known as the  “country of 30 million palm trees”, and home to 600 varieties of the fruit, Iraq’s date production has been blighted by decades of conflict and environmental challenges, including drought, desertification and salinisation.
The Fadak plantation, taking its name from a date-filled oasis central to Islam’s origins, is a 500-hectare (1,235 acres) farm operated by the Imam Hussein Shrine in the nearby holy city of Karbala.
Abul-Maali hopes the project, launched in 2016, will  “restore this culture to what it used to be”.
The grove is a repository for  “more than 90 date varieties, Iraqi but also Arab species”, from the Gulf and North Africa, he adds.
The Iraqi varieties are among  “the rarest and best” and were collected from across the country.
Of the 30,000 trees planted at Fadak, more than 6,000 are already producing fruit, according to Abul-Maali.
He expects this year’s harvest to reach 60 tonnes, a threefold increase on 2021.
The rows of new trees at the Fadak farm stand in stark contrast to the state of plantations in other parts of the country.
‘Like a cemetery’
The scene at Fadak with well-watered trees is far removed from the Basra region, once a centre of date production in southern Iraq.
Here the landscape is scarred with the slender trunks of decapitated palm trees.
In the Shatt al-Arab area, where the Euphrates and Tigris rivers meet, Baghdad razed entire tracts during its 1980-88 war with Iran.
Often the trunks of felled date palms were used to fill and bury irrigation canals that had dried up and become unused.
“It looks like a cemetery,” says agricultural engineer Alaa al-Badran.
According to him, the number of palm trees in the area has fallen from six million, before the Iraq-Iran war, to less than three million today.
Now  “the salinisation of the waters of the Shatt al-Arab and of the land” poses an even greater challenge, Badran says.
“The solution would be drip irrigation and desalination systems. But that can be expensive,” says Ahmed al-Awad, whose family once owned 200 date palms in the area but only have 50 trees remaining.
Iraq’s agriculture ministry claims some progress in addressing declining date palm production.
“In the last 10 years we have gone from 11 million palm trees to 17 million,” says Hadi al-Yasseri, a spokesman for the minister.
A government programme to rescue the date palms was launched in 2010, but eight years later it was shelved due to a lack of funds, says Yasseri.
But he expects it to be relaunched, as new funds are due to be included in the next government budget.
Upstream diversions
According to official figures, Iraq exported almost 600,000 tonnes of dates in 2021.
The fruit is the country’s second largest export commodity after oil, according to the World Bank.
“As global demand is increasing, the ongoing initiatives in Iraq on improving quality should be continued,” a recent World Bank report stated.
While exports earn the national economy $120 million annually, the organisation laments that much of Iraq’s crop is sold to the United Arab Emirates, where dates are repackaged and re-exported for higher prices.
In the town of Badra, on Iraq’s eastern border with Iran, grievances are commonplace.
The scars of war are evident among groves of decapitated palm trees.
For more than a decade, officials have complained of scarce water supplies, and have accused 
Iran of upstream diversions of the Mirzabad River, known locally as Al-Kalal.
“The date of Badra is incomparable,” says Mussa Mohsen who owns around 800 date palm trees. “Before, we had water from Al-Kalal which came from Iran,” he recalls.
“Badra was like a sea but now to irrigate we rely on wells.”

7,8 killed as Ukraine’s cargo plane crashes in Greece,Cargo plane was carrying munitions from Serbia to Bangladesh.,"ATHENS: A Ukrainian cargo plane carrying munitions from Serbia to Bangladesh crashed near the city of Kavala in northern Greece late on Saturday, killing the crew members on board, Serbian authorities and Meridian airline said on Sunday.
Drone images from the scene showed smouldering debris from the Antonov An-12 aircraft strewn in fields. Greek authorities said there were eight crew members on board and a Ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said they were all Ukrainian citizens.
Ukrainian-based airline Meridian, which operated the aircraft, said all the crew members were killed in the crash.
Serbia’s defence minister said the plane was carrying 11.5 tonnes of products, including mortar and training shells, made by its defence industry. The buyer of the cargo was the defence ministry of Bangladesh, he said.
Denys Bogdanovych, Meridian’s general director, confirmed Serbia’s account of events. “This is not related to Ukraine or Russia,” Bogdanovych told Reuters by telephone.
Witnesses said the aircraft came down in a ball of flames before exploding on impact in corn fields around midnight local time. Earlier the pilot had reported engine trouble and had requested an emergency landing.
Greek authorities could not provide information on the aircraft’s cargo or the crew. The special disaster response unit and army experts were dispatched to the scene, while local authorities issued a ban on people moving in the area.
Serbias defence minister Nebojsa Stefanovic said the cargo included illuminating mortar shells and training shells. It had taken off at 1840 GMT Saturday from Nis in Serbia.
“The plane carried 11.5 tonnes of products made by our defence industry. The buyer was the Bangladesh defence ministry,” Stefanovic said.
He said the plane’s cargo was owned by Serbian company Valir, a company registered to perform foreign trade activities of armament military equipment and other defence products.
Greek state TV ERT said the aircraft’s signal was lost soon after the pilot requested an emergency landing from Greek aviation authorities due to an engine problem.
Amateur video footage uploaded on ertnews.gr showed the aircraft in flames descending fast before hitting the ground in what appeared to be an explosion.
“I wonder how it didn’t fall on our houses,” one witness, Aimilia Tsaptanova, told reporters. “It was full of smoke, it had a noise I can’t describe and went over the mountain. It passed the mountain and turned and crashed into the fields.” A senior source at Jordan’s civil aviation regulatory commission denied initial reports that the plane was headed to Jordan. The source said that its flight itinerary included a stopover in Jordans Queen Alia international airport at 9:30 pm, to refuel, state news agency Petra reported on Sunday.
It was also due to stop in Riyadh and Ahmedabad in India before heading to Dhaka, Serbia’s defence minister said.

8,Car bomb kills five at Somalia hotel,Attack has been claimed by militants aligned with Al Qaeda.,"MOGADISHU: A powerful car bomb killed at least five people on Sunday outside a popular hotel in central Somalia, police and witnesses said, in an attack claimed by militants aligned with Al Qaeda.
The blast injured 14 others and destroyed not just the hotel but adjacent buildings in Jowhar about 90 kilometres (56 miles) north of Somalia’s capital Mogadishu.
Police said the attackers rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into the outer wall of the Nur-doob hotel, popular with state lawmakers and other local officials.
“They have killed five civilians, among them women working in the hotel and security guards,” said Mohamed Ali, a police officer in Jowhar, said.
“Fourteen other people were wounded, some of them inside buildings not even close to the hotel.” Al Shabaab, a Somalia-based group tied to Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on a pro-militant website.
Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre, who was endorsed by Somalia’s parliament in June after a recent change of government, sent condolences to the victims and offered to assist those injured.
Ali, the police officer, said the blast  “was the biggest ever seen in Jowhar” and caused significant damage to buildings in the city.
Mahad Ibrahim, a Jowhar resident, said the explosion sent shrapnel flying and clouds of smoke and dust into the air. The force of the shockwave ripped the roof of his house, he added.
“I have never seen such devastation. I saw some dead bodies recovered from under the debris of the part of the hotel that collapsed.” Ano­ther witness, Abdirahman Shabelow, said bystanders were wounded by blast debris.
“I saw two civilians struck by shrapnel some distance from the hotel... the blast sent a powerful shockwave felt in every house across town.” Al Shabaab have been waging a deadly insurgency in Somalia for over a decade and remain capable of executing major attacks despite a long-running African Union operation to degrade the militants.

“Next Sunday, God willing, I will leave for Canada,” he said at the end of the Angelus prayer, in an apparent reference to a knee problem which caused him to postpone a trip last month to Africa. The pontiff is expected to use his July 24-30 visit to Edmonton, Quebec and Iqaluit to repeat an apology he delivered to Canadian delegations who visited the Vatican in April.
He had  “expressed my sorrow and solidarity for the harm they have suffered”, Pope Francis told the crowds gathered in Saint Peter’s square on Sunday.
“And now I am about to make a penitential pilgrimage, which I hope, with God’s grace, will contribute to the journey of healing and reconciliation already undertaken,” he said.
The trip to Canada is an important step in the 85-year old’s efforts to address the global scandal of clerical sexual abuse of children and decades of cover-up.

10,Macau extends Covid shutdown after surge in infections,"HONG KONG: Macau is set to begin another working week of partial lockdown, after the city extended the closure of ...","HONG KONG: Macau is set to begin another working week of partial lockdown, after the city extended the closure of its casinos and non-essential businesses to try and eradicate its worst coronavirus outbreak yet.
Authorities had announced a week of  “static management” starting June 11 after recording more than 1,500 infections in the previous three weeks despite multiple rounds of compulsory mass testing of the city’s population.
The restrictions had been due to lift on Monday, but cases have continued to climb, with the Macau government saying there had been 1,733 cases recorded since the start of the outbreak. Daily case numbers are comparatively small by global standards, but authorities have moved quickly to stamp out transmission as they adhere to mainland China’s strict zero-Covid policy.
On Saturday the government announced that the  “static management” period would be extended through Friday.
All residents have to stay home except to go shopping for daily necessities and to get tested for the virus, with rule-breakers facing up to two years in jail.
Some public services and businesses such as supermarkets and pharmacies are allowed to stay open, but casinos — which in normal times account for around 80 percent of government revenue — need to keep their doors closed.
Macau hosts a casino industry bigger than that of Las Vegas, generating more than half the city’s gross domestic product and employing nearly one-fifth of the population.
The only city in China where casino gambling is permitted, Macau has seen its vital tourism revenues wiped out by some of the world’s harshest measures to tackle the virus — including tough border controls, weeks-long quarantines and targeted lockdowns.
Chinese President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign has also seen increased scrutiny of big-spending gamblers and corrupt officials who might travel to Macau to launder money.
Macau residents may face further economic woes after city officials declared that employers are not obligated to pay workers during the Covid-related shutdown.
China reports 691 new cases
Mainland  China reported 691 new Covid-19 cases, of which 154 were  symptomatic and 537 were asymptomatic, the National Health Commission  said on Sunday.
That compares with 547 new cases a day earlier — 129 symptomatic and 418 asymptomatic infections, which China counts separately. Among the new cases, 580 were locally transmitted, the highest since May 23. Most were discovered in Guangxi and Gansu.
Lanzhou,  the capital city of Gansu, announced on Sunday that its main city  districts would extend a temporary lockdown by another seven days to  July 24.
The southwestern city of Chengdu, which reported 7 local  cases on Sunday as of 4pm (0800 GMT), closed some of the  entertainment businesses such as bars and karaoke sites and rolled out  capacity limits at restaurants, cinemas and gyms.
A negative Covid  test result within the 48 hours will also be required for people to  leave the city from 6pm on Monday, the local government said. China’s capital, Beijing, reported another day of no new infections.
The  financial hub of Shanghai reported 26 new local cases for Saturday,  with one case found outside of quarantined areas, according to the local  government.
As of Saturday, mainland China had confirmed 227,426 cases. China reported no new Covid deaths, leaving the death toll to 5,226.

11,"Pacific bloc seeks action from China, US on climate change",Leaders at Pacific Islands Forum summit bristle at Chinese attempt to split some nations off into a trade and security agreement.,"SUVA: Pacific island nations, courted by China and the United States, put the superpowers on notice, telling the world’s two biggest carbon emitters to take more action on climate change while pledging unity in the face of a growing geopolitical contest.
Leaders at a four-day summit of the Pacific Islands Forum, meeting in Fiji’s capital Suva, bristled at a Chinese attempt to split some of the nations off into a trade and security agreement, while Washington pledged more financial and diplomatic engagement.
The exclusive economic zones of the 17 forum members span 30 million square km (10 million square miles) of ocean — providing half the world’s tuna, the most-eaten fish. The nations are also feeling some of the severest effects of climate change as rising seas inundate lower-lying areas.
At the summit that ended on Thursday, leaders adopted language several members have used in declaring a climate emergency, saying this was supported not only by science but by people’s daily lives in the Pacific.
A communique, yet to be released, shows the nations focussed on the next United Nations climate conference, COP27. They will push for a doubling of climate finance to flow from big emitters to developing nations within two years, money they say is needed to adapt to rising sea levels and worsening storms.
The communique also calls for meaningful progress at COP27 on financing for the  “loss and damage” to vulnerable societies that cannot adapt and will need to relocate communities — a battle lost at last year’s global climate talks.
“What matters most to us is we secure bold commitments from all countries at COP27 to phase out coal and other fossil fuels and step up finance to the most vulnerable nations and advance causes like ‘loss and damage’ that matter dearly to the most at-risk island communities,” Fiji’s President Frank Bainimarama told reporters.
“We simply cannot settle for any less than the survival of every Pacific island country,” said Bainimarama, the forum’s chairman.
Tuvalu’s Foreign Minister Simon Kofe, who literally made waves at the last global climate conference by standing knee-deep in seawater to show what his country faces, said:  “There is technology available to protect the islands and raise the islands and that is what we are seeking. It is very costly.”  As the Pacific summit was ending, Australian coal-mining stocks soared on expectations China could resume imports after a two-year political dispute halted coal shipments to the world’s biggest coal burner from its second-biggest exporter.
In contrast to the market’s bullishness, leaders in the forum’s thatched-roof headquarters discussed how to deal with the statehood of people whose nation has sunk in rising seas, or rights to fishing grounds defined by their distance from a landmass that may disappear.
The communique cites an urgent need for assistance on debt vulnerability and the rising cost of food amid the pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
In a video address to the forum, US Vice President Kamala Harris pledged to triple funding to Pacific islands over a decade under a fisheries treaty, and open more embassies.
Pacific leaders at times showed irritation at the global focus on the contest between the Washington and Beijing over their region.
Australia, in tune, said less about security and pledged greater support for the climate change agenda of its neighbours, although maritime surveillance announcements to protect sustainable fishing hinted at its core anxiety.

12,"Putin health rumours are ‘wishful thinking’, says UK military chief","Britain’s next leader should be aware that Russia poses “the biggest threat” to the UK, he says","LONDON: The head of Britain’s armed forces has dismissed as  “wishful thinking” speculation that Russian President Vladimir Putin is suffering from ill-health or could be assassinated.
As the Conservative party chooses a successor to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Admiral Tony Radakin also said Britain’s next leader should be aware that Russia poses  “the biggest threat” to the UK and that its challenge would endure for decades.
“I think some of the comments that he’s not well or that actually surely somebody’s going to assassinate him or take him out, I think they’re wishful thinking,” the chief of the defence staff said of Putin, in a BBC television interview broadcast on Sunday.
“As military professionals we see a relatively stable regime in Russia.
President Putin has been able to quash any opposition, we see a hierarchy that is invested in President Putin and so nobody at the top has got the motivation to challenge President Putin,” Radakin added.
“And that is bleak.” Russia’s land forces may pose less of a threat now, after suffering setbacks in the war in Ukraine, the military chief said.
The invasion has killed or wounded 50,000 Russian soldiers and destroyed nearly 1,700 Russian tanks, as well as some 4,000 armoured fighting vehicles, he estimated.
“But Russia continues to be a nuclear power. It’s got cyber capabilities, it’s got space capabilities and it’s got particular programmes under water so it can threaten the underwater cables that allow the world’s information to transit around the whole globe.” Ukraine will dominate military briefings for Johnson’s successor when he or she takes office on Sept 6, Radakin said.
