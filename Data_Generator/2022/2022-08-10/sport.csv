0,Australia smash India to win hockey gold on final day of Commonwealths,"Six-time defending champions show their opponents no mercy, beat them 7-0.","BIRMINGHAM: Australia dem­o­li­shed India 7-0 in the men’s hockey final on Monday to maintain their perfect record at the Commonwealth Games and end their gold medal hunt in style.
The six-time defending champions showed their opponents no mercy in sweltering conditions on the final day of sporting action in Birmingham.
Australia have won every gold medal in men’s hockey since the sport joined the Commonwealth Games programme in 1998.
The dominant Australians were 2-0 up after the first quarter and two goals from Jacob Anderson helped put them 5-0 up after 30 minutes.

Nathan Ephraums scored his second to make it 6-0 and Flynn Ogilvie completed the rout early in the final quarter.
Australia’s Blake Govers said the team had saved their best performance until last.
That’s what we pride ourselves on,” he said.“It’s awesome to do it without too much of a heart problem. We had to play with confidence and play forward and take the game on from the start, and that’s what we did. That’s the difference between the two games [final and semi-final against England].” Host nation England beat South Africa 6-3 to take bronze.

Australia have topped the medals table with 67 golds — 10 ahead of England. Canada are third with 26 golds and India have 22.
The closing ceremony takes place at Alexander Stadium later on Monday, bringing to an end 11 days of sporting action at the 22nd Commonwealth Games.
Elsewhere on Monday, Scot­land’s James Heatly and Grace Reid won the mixed synchronised 3m springboard final, with England pair Noah Williams and Andrea Spendolini-Sirieix taking gold in the 10m event.

India celebrated a golden double in badminton.
World number seven PV Sin­d­hu won the women’s singles, overcoming Canada’s Michelle Li while Lakshya Sen beat Malaysia’s Ng Tze Yong to win the men’s gold.
India’s Sharath Kamal Acha­nta beat England’s Liam Pitchford 4-1 in the men’s singles table tennis gold-medal match.
The best two weeks of my 40 years of life,” said the winner, who won three golds and a silver in Birmingham.“It can’t get better.”
Birmingham 2022 CEO Ian Reid said the Games had been a huge boost for the city and the surrounding area.
He said more than 1.5 million tickets had been sold, with most venues above 90 percent capacity.

One of the goals at the outset was to put the city on the world map and instil that huge pride across everyone that lives in the region and I think we’ve achieved that,” he told a briefing on Monday. I think that can lead to much bigger and greater things.”
On Sunday, Australia won the first women’s cricket gold medal in Commonwealth Games history as Scotland’s Laura Muir captured the 1500m title on the final night of athletics.
Elsewhere, England’s women won hockey gold and Australia beat Jamaica in the netball final.
Hot favourites Australia held their nerve to beat India by nine runs in a Twenty20 thriller in front of a big Edgbaston crowd and partied on the pitch as the lights went out around the stadium.
It’s absolutely huge,” said left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen. We are blessed enough to be part of some winning World Cup teams but to win the first gold medal for women’s cricket in the Common­wealth Games, you’re only ever going to do that once.”
Victory underlined the dominance of Australia’s women, who are also world champions in the 20-over and 50-over formats.
Muir ended her Common­wealth Games campaign with a flourish by winning gold in the 1500m at the Alexander Stadium.

The 29-year-old’s team-mate, 10,000m champion Eilish McColgan, just failed in her bid for memorable double, finishing second behind Kenya’s impressive world silver medallist Beatrice Chebet in the women’s 5,000m.
Muir, who won bronze in the 800m on Saturday, kicked for glory before the bell and ran a fairly moderate field — lacking two-time Olympic champion Faith Kipyegon — ragged, timing 4min 02.75sec.
Wyclife Kinyamal defended his men’s 800m crown in a time of 1:47.52. It was an impressive turnaround for the 25-year-old, who finished last in the final of the world championships in July.
New Zealand cyclist Aaron Gate won the men’s road race to collect his fourth gold medal of the Commonwealth Games. In the women’s race, Australia’s Georgia Baker won her third gold of the games.
England won hockey gold for the first time after holding off a fightback from Australia to win 2-1.
Second-quarter goals from Holly Hunt and Tess Howard ultimately provided decisive 24 hours after the men’s team had suffered semi-final despair at the hands of Australia.
There was more joy for Australia in the netball competition, with a 55-51 over Jamaica in the final.
Australia also shone at the Sandwell Aquatics Centre. Cassiel Rousseau took the men’s 10m platform title and Maddison Keeney won her second gold of the games in the women’s 3m springboard.
England’s Delicious Orie won super heavyweight gold on a busy night of boxing, beating India’s Sagar Ahlawat.
India won three other golds in boxing but Northern Ireland took five, including a special double for Aidan Walsh and his sister Michaela.

1,"Hours after reaching Konya, Shajar Abbas exits in 100m heat",Clocked 10.25 seconds against his previous best of 10.37 but remains fourth in Islamic Solidarity Games contest.,"LAHORE: Emerging Pakistan runner Shajar Abbas, despite earning his career-best timing, exited the 100-metre heat in the Islamic Solidarity Games, which started in Konya, Turkey on Monday.
According to the information received here from Konya, the 22-year-old Shajar clocked 10.25 seconds against his previous best of 10.37 in the heat and remained fourth, so exited from the further contest of 100m race.
It is learnt that Shajar reached Konya at 5:00am on Monday morning — just hours before he was scheduled to feature in the Islamic Solidarity Games — after competing in the Commonwealth Games where he demonstrated impressive performance by qualifying for the 200-metre final where he finished last.
Soon after his hotel check-in at Konya, the runner rushed to compete in the 100-metre race. Had Shajar whose participation in the Commonwealth Games ended on Saturday night, left for Turkey the same day, he could have been in a better shape to compete in Konya.
The opening ceremony of the Islamic Solidarity Games is scheduled for Tuesday.

2,"Kohli, Rahul in Asia Cup squad; Bumrah out injured",NEW DELHI: India batsmen Virat Kohli and KL Rahul have been recalled to the Twenty20 squad for the Asia Cup but...,"NEW DELHI: India batsmen Virat Kohli and KL Rahul have been recalled to the Twenty20 squad for the Asia Cup but seamer Jasprit Bumrah has been ruled out due to injury, the country’s cricket governing body BCCI said on Monday.
Former captain Kohli and Bumrah were left out of the T20 squad for the five-match series against West Indies, which India went on to win 4-1 on Sunday.
Kohli has endured a lean run of form across all formats and the 33-year-old is without a century in international cricket since November 2019.
Rahul returns to the squad after a lengthy period on the sidelines following a groin injury and Covid-19 diagnosis. He will be Rohit Sharma’s deputy.
Harshal Patel is also not available for selection due to injury, while Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel and Deepak Chahar have been named as standbys.
India are defending champions at the Asia Cup, which will be played from Aug 27-Sept 11 in the UAE. They will open their campaign against arch-rivals and neighbours Pakistan in a blockbuster Sunday clash.
The tournament, which serves as preparation for the Asian sides in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup later this year, was shifted to the UAE last month due to the political and economic crisis in Sri Lanka, who retain the hosts’ honour.
Squad: Rohit Sharma (captain), KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, Suryakumar Yadav, Deepak Hooda, Rishabh Pant, Dinesh Karthik, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Yuzvendra Chahal, Ravi Bishnoi, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Arshdeep Singh, Avesh Khan.

3,Canada’s Hamilton prepared to throw CWG 100th anniversary party,"BIRMINGHAM: The Commonwealth Games are ready to return in 2030 to Hamilton, the Canadian city that launched the...","BIRMINGHAM: The Commonwealth Games are ready to return in 2030 to Hamilton, the Canadian city that launched the multi-sport event 100 years ago, with Niagara Falls providing the backdrop for beach volleyball and a push to add men’s cricket to the programme.
With the federal and provincial governments expressing support and no other cities having formally thrown their hats in the ring, Hamilton bid leader Louis Frapporti told Reuters the ‘Steel City’ is the favourite when the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) makes a decision sometime next year.
“Without jinxing it we are clearly the punitive favourite if only because we have invested so much time and energy in actually creating a proposal,” said Frapporti.  “The only country we are hearing any rumblings about is New Zealand.
“What we understand is we are so far ahead of them in terms of preparation of a bid that they are more likely to be interested in 2034 than 2030.”
If chosen it would mark the fifth time Canada has hosted the quadrennial event but the first since 1994 when they were held in Victoria, British Colombia.
Hamilton staged the first competition in 1930 when it was known as the British Empire Games and had just six sports; athletics, boxing, lawn bowls, rowing, swimming, and wrestling.
Women competed only in aquatic events.
At the Birmingham Games, which came to close on Monday, nearly 5,000 athletes from 72 nations and territories competed in 19 sports.
For the first time at a major multi-sport event there were more medal events for women (136) than men (134) and a record eight integrated para-sports with podium finishes counting in the overall medal standings.
While the 100th anniversary provides an obvious hook on which to hang a pitch, the Hamilton100 Commonwealth Games Bid Corporation will not be playing the sentiment card but instead focus on the elements that made the Birmingham Games a success.
“We are very light on the centenary celebration elements,” said Frapporti.  “Some people, like our [Hamilton] mayor, are very keen on that but from the perspective of us who have actually crafted the proposal we see that as the least compelling part of this.
“We want to get away from the concept of the Games as an event in time.
“Rather we are looking to take the CGF’s value proposition which includes inclusivity, diversity, sustainability and make it about a movement.”
Diversity, inclusion and private funding are buzz words that perk up government ears, particularly when it comes to spending taxpayer money.
Originally the Hamilton100 bid proposed an operating budget of around $1.5 billion (CDN).
But that has been trimmed to around $1 billion, about the same cost of the Birmingham Games with, according to Frapporti, the private sector kicking in between $250 to $500 million.
“What differentiates the Games framework at this point is a very significant amount of private sector investment around the delivery of infrastructure assets,” said Frapporti.
The biggest infrastructure project in the Hamilton bid would be the construction of an athletes village, which under current plans would be privately delivered.
The private sector would also be responsible for renovating the FirstOntario Centre in downtown Hamilton and contribute to the building of a state-of-the-art cricket facility.
Otherwise, the bid leans heavily on existing facilities across what is known as the ‘Golden Horseshoe’ such as the velodrome in nearby Milton built for the 2015 Pan Am Games.
The bid will also make use of one of the world’s natural wonders with Niagara Falls providing the backdrop for beach volleyball.
“To the extent the Commonwealth Games aspires to be the ‘Olympics light’ there is no path to success doing that,” said Frapporti.  “What we sought to do is embrace those values and opportunities which actually truly differentiate the sport so very much around inclusivity.”

4,Kyrgios clinches first ATP title in three years,WASHINGTON: Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios won his seventh ATP title and first in three years by defeating...,"WASHINGTON: Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios won his seventh ATP title and first in three years by defeating Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka in Sunday’s men’s final at the ATP and WTA Washington Open.
The 27-year-old Australian downed 96th-ranked left-hander Nishioka 6-4, 6-3 for his first ATP title since capturing the 2019 Washington crown.
“It’s emotional for me to be back here again and claim another title,” Kyrgios said.
Kyrgios, who lost to Novak Djokovic last mon­th in his first Grand Slam final, made back-to-back tour-level finals for the first time in his career and didn’t allow a service break all week.
“It’s just very emotional for me to see where I was at last year to now. It’s just an incredible transformation,” Kyrgios said.  
World number 63 Ky­r­gios fired 12 aces and 32 winners against four double faults and 20 unforced errors while taking 22 of 25 first-serve points to defeat Nishioka in 81 minutes.
Kyrgios improved to 4-0 against Nishioka.
In the women’s final, Liudmila Samsonova won her second career WTA title by beating Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. Her first title came at last year’s German Open on Berlin grass.
Kyrgios became the first man to sweep singles and doubles titles in the event’s 53-year history — a feat he called  “super special” — by joining American Jack Sock to beat Croatian Ivan Dodig and American Austin Krajicek 7-5, 6-4 in the final.
Nishioka netted a backhand to surrender a break in the opening game and Kyrgios denied the Asian southpaw’s lone break chance with a backhand winner in the sixth game, holding out to claim the first set with his seventh ace.
Kyrgios broke in the first game of the second set when Nishioka sent a forehand long and again in the final game when Nishioka netted a backhand on the Aussie’s third match point.

Talking to Dawn, Hamad said the PCB members were informed during their visit to the GIK Institute cricket ground that the venue was registered with the PCB and that the Institute wanted to further modernise it.
According to Hamad, deve­­lo­pment of women’s cricket also came under discussion.
“Promotion of women’s cricket and establishment of a biomechanics lab at the GIK Institute were also discussed [during the meeting],” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, Yasir proposed clay from Gujranwala be brought  for the ground and lauded the modern faci­lities provided to students at the GIK Institute.
Prof Khalid acknowledged Yasir’s continued efforts for promoting cricket in Swabi and his important role in helping Pakistan win international matches.

Lewandowski, who had failed to score in any of Barca’s friendlies on their US tour, opened the scoring in the third minute of the Joan Gamper Trophy match after he converted Pedri’s pass with a brilliant finish from a tight angle.
Barca’s new signing then returned the favour as he set up the 19-year-old midfielder to score two minutes later.
Lewandowski handed Pedri another assist for the Spain International to make it 4-0 in the 19th minute after forward Ousmane Dembele scored their third of the night.
Striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and midfielder Frenkie de Jong got on the scoresheet in the second half.
“I am happy to (have) played the first game at Camp Nou and ... to win the trophy,” Lewandowski said in a video on Barca’s social media account, holding his Man of the Match award.

After a troubled summer during which Jorge Sampaoli walked out over his unhappiness at the club’s transfer approach, it was a welcome win for Tudor following a turbulent pre-season.
“I’m clearly very happy, it’s a clear and deserved victory,” said Tudor.
The former Croatia Internati­onal was jeered by home fans ahead of kick-off, but an own goal by Wout Faes and debut goals for Nuno Tavares and Luis Suarez lifted spirits at the Velodrome.
Folarin Balogun, like Tavares an Arsenal loanee, replied late on for Reims before Suarez grabbed his second of the evening.
“The whistles towards me? I was inside, I didn’t hear them,” said Tudor.
“The supporters are always right. We play for them and they do what they want.
Football doesn’t exist without them.” Tudor dropped captain Dimitri Payet to the bench, handing debuts to five players including Tavares and Jonathan Clauss, who earned a France call-up with Lens last season.
Clauss was soon involved as Reims defender Faes turned the right-back’s cross into his own net under pressure from Arkadiusz Milik on 13 minutes.
Marseille were unlucky not to add to their lead with Cengiz Under and Valentin Rongier hitting the woodwork, but Tavares made it 2-0 with a fine low strike just before half-time.
Colombian forward Suarez, signed from Granada in July, needed just 13 minutes to open his Ligue 1 account, steering home after the ball bounced around the Reims penalty area.
England Under-21 International Balogun headed in to cut the deficit, but Suarez ensured it was Marseille’s night by tapping home Cedric Bakambu’s pass deep into stoppage time.
Aaron Ramsey scored a minute into his Nice debut after coming on as a second-half substitute to rescue a 1-1 draw away to promoted Toulouse.
The Wales International curled in an equaliser on 78 minutes to cancel out a first-half goal by new Toulouse signing Thijs Dallinga, the top scorer last season in the Dutch second division.Jonathan David scored twice as Portuguese coach Paulo Fonseca began his reign at Lille with a 4-1 home victory over Auxerre, who are back in the top flight for the first time in a decade.
Benjamin Andre put Lille ahead inside the opening minute before Canada star David doubled the lead with just three minutes played.
David added a third before half-time and Akim Zedadka made it 4-0 just past the hour. Gaetan Charbonnier grabbed a consolation for Auxerre.
Belgium defender Arthur The­ate had a debut to forget for Rennes, putting an own goal past fellow newcomer Steve Mandanda in a 1-0 home defeat by Lorient.
Theate, signed from Bologna in July, shanked a cross past Mand­anda, the 37-year-old World Cup winner who left Marseille last month after making a record 613 appearances for the club.
Wales centre-back Joe Rodon also made his Rennes debut alongside Theate after signing on a season-long loan from Totte­nham Hotspur. Florian Sotoca bagged a hat-trick despite missing a penalty to earn Lens a 3-2 win against Brest, while Montpellier beat Troyes by the same scoreline.
Last season’s French Cup winners Nantes, who were thrashed by Paris St-Germain in the Champions Trophy in Israel a week ago, drew 0-0 at Angers.

Despite 68 per cent possession and chalking up 27 shots to Stuttgart’s 11, Leipzig were unable to convert their dominance into an opening day win.
Leipzig got on the board in the eighth minute through Nkunku, who threaded a shot past the outstretched hands of Stuttgart keeper Florian Mueller and into the bottom left corner.
Fresh off being named Germany’s footballer of the year for his contributions in the 2021-22 season, Nkunku was dangerous throughout, often dropping back well into his own half to retrieve the ball and kickstart an attack.
Leipzig dominated the early stages, before the home side got a goal back against the run of play through former Juventus midfielder Naouirou Ahamada.
Ahamada curled the ball into the bottom corner of the net in the 31st minute, celebrating even before the ball went in.
Leipzig coach Domenico Tedesco made several attacking changes in the dying stages of the match as the visitors went in search of a winner, bringing on striker Alexander Soerloth and Emil Forsberg in the 85th minute.
After the match, Tedesco lauded the performance of opposing keeper Mueller.
“We didn’t score goals. That was somewhat down to us, but also to the opposing goalkeeper,” Tedesco told broadcaster DAZN.
“We have to live with it.” Stuttgart’s American coach Pellegrino Matarazzo said his side, who narrowly escaped relegation on the final matchday last season, had picked up a  “slightly lucky but not undeserved point”.
In Sunday’s late game, Cologne overcame the news that star striker Anthony Modeste had signed with Borussia Dortmund moments before kick-off to defeat 10-man Schalke 3-1 at home.
Schalke midfielder Dominick Drexler was red-carded in the 35th minute for sinking his studs into the calf of Cologne’s Jonas Hector.
The newly promoted Royal Blues managed to hold on until half-time, before conceding three times in the second half.
Borussia Dortmund junior Luca Kilian latched onto a Hector cross to score Cologne’s first in the 49th minute, before Florian Kainz took advantage of a fumble from Schalke goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow to score the home side’s second in the 62nd minute.
Schalke pulled one back when Marius Buelter superbly headed in a cross in the 76th minute, but Cologne extinguished the visitors’ hopes just four minutes later when Dejan Ljubicic headed in his side’s third.
Speaking after the match, Kilian said he felt  “pure pleasure” in scoring against Schalke, the bitter rivals of his former club Dortmund.
“To score against Schalke feels especially good, for someone who was born in Dortmund. Nothing has ever tasted so good.” Cologne reportedly pocketed a five million euro ($5.1 million) transfer fee for Modeste, who scored 20 goals last season to propel Cologne to seventh place and a maiden Europa Conference League appearance.

10,Deadly Haaland strikes twice to give City victory  at West Ham,LONDON: New Manchester City signing Erling Haaland marked a fine Premier League debut by scoring in each half as the...,"LONDON: New Manchester City signing Erling Haaland marked a fine Premier League debut by scoring in each half as the champions began their title defence by strolling to a 2-0 victory over West Ham United at the London Stadium on Sunday.
Haaland converted a penalty after 36 minutes and wrapped up the points with a composed finish in the second period to cap an impressive display, with his father and former City player Alfie celebrating in the stands.
“It’s nice that he saw both goals as it is a big moment for me as a debutant in this competition,” the 22-year-old Haaland said.  “Also now it is almost 30 minutes since I scored the last goal so I have to keep going.”  Haaland charged past the West Ham defence to latch onto a through ball and take it around Alphonse Areola before being fouled by the substitute goalkeeper, who had replaced the injured Lukasz Fabianski after 29 minutes.
West Ham were forced into the early change when Fabianski picked up a knock clearing a cross from Kevin De Bruyne as he clattered into team-mate Aaron Cresswell and Haaland.
The Norwegian striker stepped up to convert the resultant spot kick, his cool finish sending Areola the wrong way to give City a deserved lead after an utterly dominant first half in which West Ham were rarely able to venture from their own box.
City, who had a first-half goal disallowed after Ilkay Gundogan was offside in the build-up, made a slightly disjointed start to the match but gradually strengthened their grip on the contest and doubled their lead after the hour mark.
Midfielder Kevin De Bruyne had defended a series of crosses before slipping through a delightful pin-point pass to Haaland, who timed his run to perfection and slotted home with a fine left-foot finish in the 65th minute.
West Ham forward Michail Antonio had headed wide in the opening stages and De Bruyne easily cleared Jarrod Bowen’s free-kick just before halftime, but the hosts struggled to make their mark on the game in a largely toothless attacking display.
Manager David Moyes brought on Said Benrahma and new signing Gianluca Scamacca just before the hour mark in an attempt to change West Ham’s fortunes but Haaland doubled City’s lead minutes after and the visitors comfortably saw out the win.
City have a new look to them this season after the departure of four first team players but there has been no disruption to Guardiola’s passing machine, with the club aiming to win a third straight league title.
Guardiola’s side controlled 80 per cent of possession in the first half and 76 per cent overall but did not have to exert themselves against a passive West Ham side, who faded after a bright first few minutes.
City also scored with their only two shots on target in a clinical performance that presented an ominous prospect for their rivals, showing that they will once again be the team to beat in the title race.
They host Bournemouth next weekend while West Ham travel to Nottingham Forest.

11,Moeen fears losing  50-over cricket due to unsustainable schedule,Other England players such as Jos Buttler and Joe Root have also voiced their concerns about scheduling.,"LONDON: England all-rounder Moeen Ali has warned that other players could follow team-mate Ben Stokes in quitting One-day Internationals and that the format could become completely obsolete if nothing is done to fix the game’s hectic calendar.
Stokes, England’s Test captain, announced his shock retirement from 50-over cricket at the age 31 last month, citing an “unsustainable” schedule that has come under strain because of the emergence of franchise-based Twenty20 leagues.
The International Cricket Council’s (ICC) insistence on staging one global event every year has further added to that workload.
“At the moment it’s not sustainable, in my opinion,” Moeen said on the sidelines of The Hundred, where he is leading Birmingham Phoenix.  “Something has to be done because I fear losing the 50-over format in a couple of years because it’s almost like the long, boring one... the 50 overs is just in the middle — there’s no importance given to it at the moment.”  
Other England players such as Jos Buttler and Joe Root have also voiced their concerns about scheduling while India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has questioned the relevance of the format.
“International cricket in all three formats is by far the best cricket to play,” added Moeen, who quit Test cricket last year.  
“But I do worry there are so many tournaments out there that players are retiring more now — and you’ll see more retiring soon — because of overlapping schedules.”  
The ICC this week said it hoped to retain the sport’s all-format players despite mounting criticism, with chief executive Geoff Allardice stressing that most players still had ambitions to play in World Cups and ICC events.

12,"Ten Hag loses first game as United manager to Brighton, Brentford hold Leicester",The former Ajax boss left Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench after he only returned to pre-season training last week.,"MANCHESTER: Erik ten Hag’s reign as Manchester United manager got off to a nightmare start as Brighton registered their first ever victory at Old Trafford with a 2-1 win on the opening weekend of the Premier League season while Brentford came from two goals down to draw 2-2 with  Leicester City.
Any hope of a fresh start for United after a miserable 2021/22 season was wiped away within 45 minutes as Pascal Gross struck twice to put Brighton in command.
Alexis Mac Allister’s own goal gave United a foothold in the game, but they rarely looked like getting back on level terms, showing the scale of the task lying ahead for Ten Hag.
The former Ajax boss left Cristiano Ronaldo on the bench after he only returned to pre-season training last week.
But without the five time Ballon d’Or winner, United had no focal point to their attack as Christian Eriksen started in an unfamiliar role as a false nine.
The outcome could have been very different had Bruno Fernandes not blazed over a glorious chance on six minutes.
The nadir of a nightmare campaign for United last season as they finished sixth in the Premier League came in a 4-0 defeat to Brighton in May, and the Seagulls quickly settled into their passing rhythm.
Brighton exposed the same flaws in United’s wide open midfield to pick apart Ten Hag’s men with ease.
Danny Welbeck was a constant threat in behind the vulnerable defensive pairing of Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez.
Welbeck created the opener as he ran off Maguire and laid the ball across goal for Gross to slot into an unguarded net at the back post.
Boos rang out around Old Trafford at the half-time whistle, with the home fans not only restless about the state of their side on the pitch.
Rashford looked reborn during pre-season, but failed to make his mark when it counted as Robert Sanchez produced a stunning save to block the England International’s effort from Ronaldo’s pinpoint cross.
Sanchez undid that good work to give United a lifeline 22 minutes from time.
The Spanish International flapped at a corner under pressure from Diogo Dalot and then slapped the ball into his own net off the unfortunate Mac Allister.
But an expected siege on the Brighton goal never materialised as the visitors comfortably saw out the closing stages for a famous win.
Meanwhile, Substitute Josh Dasilva scored a superb equaliser with four minutes remaining as Brentford clinched a draw at the King Power Stadium.
Dasilva went on a mazy run on the edge of the box before curling a shot  into the far corner, a goal of real quality to give Brentford a point  they deserved for their second-half display. 
Timothy Castagne and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall had scored in either  half to put Leicester into a dominant position early in the second  period, but Ivan Toney netted to halve the deficit and swing the  momentum in Brentford’s favour.
It was the first time since 2003 that Leicester had failed to win a Premier League home game having been two goals ahead.
CHELSEA DOWN EVERTON
On Saturday, Chelsea put a troubled pre-season behind them to start their Premier League campaign with a 1-0 win at Everton as Chelsea ended a run of four consecutive defeats at Goodison Park thanks to Jorginho’s penalty.
It was redemption for Italy midfielder Jorginho, who saw his  penalty saved by Everton and England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford during  the Euro 2020 final last July.
Chelsea peppered the home goal with 13  corners in the first half but looked set to be frustrated as the  interval approached, only for Jorginho to convert from the spot after  Ben Chilwell has been fouled to give the visitors the lead. 
A brilliant save from Edouard Mendy early in the second half to deny Abdoulaye Doucoure preserved Chelsea’s  advantage, and that was as good as it got for a disappointing Everton,  who only survived relegation by the skin of their teeth last term.

13,Bagnaia ready to book a taxi after British GP win,"Ducati’s Francesco Bagnaia has now won four times this season, balancing four non-finishes.","SILVERSTONE: Ducati’s Francesco Bagnaia picked up where he left off before MotoGP’s summer break by winning the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Sunday for his second victory in a row.
Spaniard Maverick Vinales had to settle for second for Aprilia, 0.426 seconds behind after a thrilling battle over the closing laps, while Australian Jack Miller was third on the other factory Ducati.
“I think this is the best win I ever had,” said Bagnaia, who went into the break celebrating a win in the Dutch TT in Assen. He has now won four times this season, balancing four non-finishes.
Bagnaia drove his car into a ditch in Ibiza after celebrating the previous win, the Italian subsequently found to be over the legal alcohol limit, and he will not be doing that again.
“Tonight I will take a taxi,” he assured reporters when reminded of that incident.
Yamaha’s reigning world champion Fabio Quartararo finished only eighth, after serving a long lap penalty, but increased his championship lead over Aprilia’s Aleix Espargaro, who was ninth, to 22 points after 12 of 20 rounds.
Quartararo now has 180 points, Espargaro 158 and Bagnaia, last year’s overall runner-up, is closing the gap but still well adrift on 131.
“I recovered a lot of points in the last two races but I still don’t want to think about the championship,” said the Italian.
“Today it was important to take advantage of Fabio’s long lap penalty.”  Espargaro crashed heavily on Saturday, when he was carried off on a stretcher, and raced with considerable pain in his legs after being cleared following the morning warm-up.
Quartararo went from fourth on the grid to second into the first corner but then dropped to fifth and just ahead of Vinales when he took the penalty on lap four.
Fellow Frenchman Johann Zarco had started on pole for the non-factory Pramac Ducati team but his record of most poles without a win continued after he slid out at Vale while leading with 16 laps to go.
Miller took over briefly at the front, going side by side with Suzuki’s Alex Rins down the Wellington Straight, but Bagnaia was coming through from fifth on the grid.
The Italian slotted into second with 14 laps remaining and hit the front five laps later with Rins struggling for grip on his tyres.
What looked like turning into a Ducati one-two, with Miller in second place, was then shaken up by Vinales surging into the runner-up slot three laps from the end. The Spaniard seized the lead with two to go but could not make the move stick, running wide at Copse corner and then Stowe.
“I tried. I felt very strong in the last part of the race,” said the Aprilia rider, who has now had two successive podium finishes.
“I pushed a lot the tyres, maybe too much. Today he (Bagnaia) was stronger.”

14,Raza stars in great run chase as Zimbabwe win BD ODI series,HARARE: Sikandar Raza scored an unbeaten 117 as Zimbabwe staged a great run chase for the second time in three days...,"HARARE: Sikandar Raza scored an unbeaten 117 as Zimbabwe staged a great run chase for the second time in three days to beat Bangladesh by five wickets on Sunday and take a winning 2-0 lead in a three-match one-day international series.
The Pakistan-born batsman hit four sixes and eight fours off 127 deliveries and his 201-run fifth-wicket partnership with captain Regis Chakabva turned the tide after Bangladesh posted 290-9 in Harare.
Chakabva played a wonderful supporting role to Raza, who has been consistently outstanding for his adopted country, smashing 102 runs off 75 balls, including two sixes and 10 fours.
Zimbabwe reached 291-5 with 15 balls to spare after the early loss of wickets and a slow scoring rate suggested they had little chance of success at Harare Sports Club.
Zimbabwe also won the first ODI match on Friday by five wickets against opponents ranked eight places higher and continued a remarkable transformation under new coach Dave Houghton.
The former national team batting star took over in June with Zimbabwe in the doldrums after 3-0 ODI and Twenty20 whitewashes by visiting Afghanistan.
Houghton told his squad to express themselves, not be afraid of making mistakes and not to be intimidated by opponents, however strong they appeared on paper.
The triumph on Sunday was the ninth in 10 ODI and T20 matches under Houghton as Zimbabwe prepare for the T20 World Cup in Australia from October.
Zimbabwe won the toss and opted to field, and once again the Bangladesh batsmen did well, led by an unbeaten 80 from Mahmudullah Riyad and a 50 from captain Tamim Iqbal.
Mahmudullah hit three sixes and three fours in a 126-minute stand while Iqbal needed just 45 balls to claim his half century, which included a six and 10 fours.
Afif Hossain (41) and Najmul Hossain (38) also made significant contributions against a Zimbabwe attack in which the spin of Raza proved most effective as he captured three wickets.
In reply, Zimbabwe lost their first wicket with just one run on the board and when they found themselves at 49-4, even supreme optimist Houghton could hardly have visualised what was about to occur.
Raza and Chakabva — standing in as series skipper for injured Craig Ervine — took the fight to the Bangladeshi attack and slowly but surely lifted the total and raised hopes of an unlikely victory.
With 40 overs gone, Zimbabwe were 220-4 and needed 71 runs from 60 balls to win both the match and the series.
The loss of Chakabva, caught by Tamim at midwicket after miscuing a Mehidy Hasan delivery, did not stop the run surge and an unbeaten 30 from ODI debutant Tony Munyonga took Zimbabwe over the line.

15,Thompson-Herah seals CWG double as Australia pull clear in medals race,BIRMINGHAM: Olympic champion Elaine Thomp­son-Herah rocketed to a sprint double at the Commonwealth Games on...,"BIRMINGHAM: Olympic champion Elaine Thomp­son-Herah rocketed to a sprint double at the Commonwealth Games on Saturday as Australia pulled clear of England at the top of the medals table.
The Jamaican sprint star, 30, was the headline act on the penultimate night of track and field competition in Birmingham and did not disappoint the capacity crowd, destroying the field to win the women’s 200m in a Games record of 22.02sec.
“I was going for a Games record in the 100 and it didn’t work so I said, ‘I must get it in the 200’,” said Thompson-Herah.
“I’m grateful to claim that gold today, the day we celebrate Independence Day in Jamaica.” Thompson-Herah topped the podium at last year’s Tokyo Olympics in both the 100m and 200m, retaining the titles she had won in Rio four years earlier.
But she only took bronze in the 100m behind compatriots Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson at last month’s world championships and finished seventh in the 200m final.
“I knew I had more races to come. I’m not a quitter,” said Thompson-Herah of her disappointing world championships results.
“It’s a motivation for me to continue to learn and just keep going.” Thompson-Herah, who won the 100m earlier in the Games, faced a tough task on paper in the 200m final despite the absence of her Jamaican rivals.
But she finished nearly half a second ahead of Nigeria’s Favour Ofili, with Namibia’s Olympic silver medallist Christine Mboma taking bronze.
Trinidad and Tobago’s Jereem Richards won the men’s 200m in a Games record time of 19.80sec.


BIRMINGHAM: New Zealand opener Sophie Devine hits the winning runs during the women’s Twenty20 bronze medal match of the Commonwealth Games against England at Edgbaston on Sunday. Devine smashed six fours and a six in her knock of 51 off 40 balls to lead her team to the paltry 111 target set by the home team. Hayley Jensen was New Zealand’s pick of the bowlers with figures of 3-24 while Fran Jonas and Devine took two wickets each.—AFP

 
World bronze medallist Mary Moraa produced an astonishing late burst to come out on top in a high-class women’s 800m field, timing 1min 57.07sec.
The Kenyan faded after a quick start but found a second wind to pip England’s Olympic silver medallist Keely Hodgkinson to gold. Scotland’s Laura Muir won bronze — her first Commonwealth medal.
“I tried to run 57 or 58 seconds for the first 400 but I think I was 56-something (56.8),” said Moraa.  “When I reached the 500m, I think everybody went past me.
“But with 200 to go, I closed the gap and then I knew I had to push myself right until the end.” 
Uganda’s Jacob Kiplimo outbattled Kenyan pair Nicholas Kipkorir Kimeli and Jacob Krop down the home straight to win the 5,000m in a season’s best time of 13min 8.08sec, completing a distance double in Birmingham after his earlier 10,000m win.
“It was a wonderful performance for me (at the Games),” he said.  “I have two (gold medals) and I’m so happy about it.” Alastair Chalmers won Guernsey’s first ever track and field medal when he took bronze in the men’s 400m hurdles.
In the morning session, Australia’s Oliver Hoare shocked world champion Jake Wightman and Kenya’s Timothy Cheruiyot to win 1500m gold.
The 25-year-old produced a storming late finish to cross the line in 3:30.12, breaking a 48-year-old Games record.
Australia’s Jemima Montag took gold in the women’s 10,000m race walk but the country’s recently crowned high jump world champion Eleanor Patterson was pushed into second place by Jamaica’s Lamara Distin.
Australia won two golds on the last night of action in the diving pool, in the women’s synchronised 3m springboard and the synchronised 10m platform.
England swept the podium in the men’s 3m springboard but Jack Laugher missed out on a third gold in Birmingham after a disappointing penultimate dive, being forced to settle for bronze.
Hot favourites Australia beat New Zealand by five wickets in their women’s Twenty20 semi-final cricket clash at Edgbaston to set up a gold medal match against India, who edged England by four runs in a thriller.
England were also beaten in the netball semi-finals by Australia, who will meet Jamaica in the final.
India beat South Africa 3-2 in the men’s hockey semi-finals and will play Australia in Monday’s gold medal match after the six-time defending champions beat England by the same scoreline.
The bowls competition wrapped up on Saturday, with Australia taking two of the final three golds on offer, in the women’s pairs and the men’s singles.
With just two days of competition to go, Australia top the overall medals table in Birmingham with 59 golds, nine ahead of hosts England.

16,Dortmund edge Leverkusen as  Union claim bragging rights in Berlin,BERLIN: A first-half goal from captain Marco Reus was enough to see Borussia Dortmund past Bayer Leverkusen while...,"BERLIN: A first-half goal from captain Marco Reus was enough to see Borussia Dortmund past Bayer Leverkusen while Union Berlin defeated city rivals Hertha to claim derby bragging rights.
In a fixture known more for attack than defence in recent years - three of the past five games between Dortmund and Leverkusen have featured seven goals — it was highlighted by defence, particularly that of Dortmund newcomer Nico Schlotterbeck.
After a nervy opening, the home side took the lead in the ninth minute when Reus finished off a slick team move kick-started by aggressive pressing from Dortmund’s 19-year-old England International Jude Bellingham.
Bellingham toe-poked the ball out of Leverkusen’s possession and into the path of Dortmund’s 17-year-old striker Youssoufa Moukoko, who glided a pass across the face of goal to Bundesliga debutant Karim Adeyemi.
Hradecky half-saved Adeyemi’s shot, before Reus slammed it into the back of the net as it trickled its way over the line in the 10th minute.
But the winning start for Dortmund was overshadowed by an injury to Adeyemi who was eventually forced out in the 23rd minute.
It was also a victorious return for Dortmund coach Edin Terzic, back on  the bench after 15 months following his first stint as an interim coach  in 2021. 
“We did not start really well, lost possession a few times but  recovered well. They were better after the break but we defend our lead  well,” said Terzic, who coached for the first time in the Bundesliga in  front of fans. 
“Sometimes it’s not possible to score more than one and you have to protect that clean sheet instead.”
In stoppage time, Hradecky was red-carded for handling the ball outside the area.
UNION KINGS OF BERLIN
American striker Jordan Siebatcheu scored on his Bundesliga debut as Union Berlin cantered to a 3-1 home victory over Hertha.
Brought in over the summer to replace Nottingham Forest-bound Taiwo Awoniyi, Siebatcheu glanced a Sheraldo Becker cross past Oliver Christensen to put Union ahead in the 32nd minute.
Becker added the second goal in the 50th minute, before Robin Knoche headed in a Christopher Trimmel corner four minutes later to put the result beyond doubt.
Hertha winger Dodi Lukebakio scored a late consolation goal.
Union have now won four in a row against their big brothers from the city’s west and have only lost twice from seven Bundesliga clashes since being promoted to the top division in 2019.Werder Bremen celebrated their return to the Bundesliga after a year in the second division by snatching a point in a 2-2 draw at Wolfsburg.
In their first Bundesliga match under former Bayern Munich and Monaco coach Niko Kovac, Wolfsburg took the lead early, with Lukas Nmecha dinking a perfect chip over keeper Jiri Pavlenka to put the home side in the lead.
Bremen, clad in a salmon pink away strip, hit back with two quick goals through Niclas Fuellkrug in 21st minute then two minutes later Leonardo Bittencourt found the net to take a lead into half-time.
Kovac brought on Max Kruse in the 76th minute with his final change.
Kruse, who scored 35 goals in 94 games with Werder, quickly created an equaliser, gliding a cross into the penalty box for Josuha Guilavogui to hammer it home.
Borussia Moenchengladbach got off to a winning start under new manager Daniel Farke, beating 10-man Hoffenheim 3-1 at home.
Hoffenheim took the lead in the 25th minute through Robert Skov just after defender Stefan Posch received his second yellow for a studs-up tackle on Ramy Bensebaini, but were unable to hold on.
Bensebaini equalised the score in the 41st minute while birthday boy Marcus Thuram gave host’s the lead in the 71st minute before Nico Elvedi seals the victory seven minutes later.
Beaten German Cup finalists in 2021-22, SC Freiburg continued their strong form under long-time manager Christian Streich, scoring four second-half goals to win 4-0 at Augsburg.
Michael Gregoritsch scored just seconds after half-time, before dead-ball specialist Vincenzo Grifo added another to put Freiburg 2-0 up in the 47th minute.
Summer arrival Matthias Ginter added a third in the 61th minute, before fellow new recruit and Japanese international Ritsu Doan added a fourth in the 78th.
Mainz defeated Bochum 2-1 through two goals from Austrian striker Karim Onisiwo.

LAUDERHILL: India advanced their preparation for the next Twenty20 World Cup with a series-clinching 59-run victory over the West Indies in the fourth fixture of a five-match series at the Broward County Stadium in Florida on Saturday.
Defending a formidable total of 191 for five in front of fiercely partisan Indian supporters at the United States venue, Rohit Sharma’s side dismissed their opponents for 132 off 19.1 overs.
India take an unbeatable 3-1 lead in the series ahead of the final match at the same venue on Sunday.
Arshdeep Singh led the bowling effort for India, the left-arm medium-pacer continuing to impress with his clever combination of swing and seam to take three for 12, finishing off the match with the wicket of Obed McCoy.
For McCoy, who established a new West Indies bowling record in T20Is with figures of six for 17 in the second match in St Kitts last Monday, this was an especially forgettable experience.
Despite taking two wickets, the left-armer was belted for 66 runs across his four overs, the most expensive spell ever by a West Indies bowler in this format.
India continued with their policy of all-out attack after being put in to bat with Rishabh Pant leading the effort for the top order with 44 off 31 balls.
Each of the top five got starts and while none was able to carry on for a really commanding innings, their pace of scoring ensured the final total was always going to be challenging on a surface where free-flowing strokeplay became increasingly difficult.
“We knew it was not going to be easy because of the conditions,” said Sharma after the match.
“I thought we had a good score on the board but just could not take things for granted. Our bowlers did extremely well to keep making crucial breakthroughs.” For West Indies captain Nicholas Pooran, the margin of the defeat was just another reminder of the amount of work required by the two-time former champions ahead of the qualifying phase for the T20 World Cup in Australia in October.
His dismissal for 24, run out after carting left-arm spinner Axar Patel for a succession of boundaries, typified West Indian frustration.
“The series may be over as a contest but the final match gives other players a chance to put their hands up ahead of the World T20,” said Pooran in hinting at a number of changes for Sunday’s finale.
“They had gotten off to a flying start batting first but I was really happy at least with the way the bowlers stuck to the task.”

Neymar was also in outstanding form for a PSG side who did not miss the injured Kylian Mbappe, with the Brazilian opening the scoring in Clermont before setting up Achraf Hakimi and Marquinhos for further goals before half-time.
Messi then exchanged passes with Neymar before sidefooting in the visitors’ fourth goal with 10 minutes left.
Yet Messi saved the best for last, darting into the box four minutes from the end to control a Leandro Paredes pass on his chest with his back to goal, before converting with an acrobatic overhead kick.
That goal had the crowd at Clermont singing the name of the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner, who endured a difficult first season in Paris.
PSG’s victory in new coach Christophe Galtier’s first league game in charge was achieved despite Mbappe missing the trip due to an adductor injury.
Mbappe also missed last week’s 4-0 defeat of Nantes in the season-opening Champions Trophy due to suspension.
Messi had opened the scoring in that game, while Neymar netted a brace.
The duo therefore already have six goals between them this season, with PSG looking in ominous form.
“There is no denying we have lots of talent but what I retain is the collective desire to win the ball back very early, to play with intensity, to never let up,” Galtier, who replaced the sacked Mauricio Pochettino, told broadcaster Canal Plus.
“The squad have been very receptive since I arrived. They like to work hard together, have fun together. But the season is long. This was just the first game.”
Galtier said he would have no trouble finding a place in the line-up for Mbappe, who is expected to return next weekend and play his first competitive game since turning down a move to Real Madrid to sign a new three-year deal in Paris.Neymar fired in the opener in the ninth minute after Messi was unable to control Pablo Sarabia’s cutback, and it was Neymar who set up Hakimi to blast in the second in the 26th minute.
The world’s most expensive player was also the provider for the third goal in the 38th minute when his free-kick from the left was headed in by Marquinhos.
Messi then took over at the end, and it is likely to be a long season for Clermont given four teams will be relegated at the end of the campaign, when Ligue 1 will be reduced from 20 clubs to 18.
Earlier, Monaco benefited from a favourable late VAR call to claim a 2-1 win at Strasbourg.
The principality side were 2-0 up and cruising when Sofiane Diop struck early in the second half to add to Krepin Diatta’s magnificent opener.
However, Habib Diallo pulled one back for Strasbourg and then appeared to have salvaged a draw when he nodded home in the second minute of added time, only for the referee to disallow the goal for a marginal offside after consulting with the VAR.
Monaco now travel to the Netherlands to face PSV Eindhoven in their Champions League third qualifying round, second leg in midweek. The first leg ended 1-1.

19,Sevilla agree deal to sign Isco on free transfer,"SEVILLE: Sevilla have reached an agreement in principle to sign free agent Isco on a two-year deal, the La Liga club...","SEVILLE: Sevilla have reached an agreement in principle to sign free agent Isco on a two-year deal, the La Liga club said on Sunday.
The former Real Madrid midfielder would undergo a medical on Monday before finalising his transfer, Sevilla added.
Spanish playmaker Isco will become the Andalusian club’s third summer signing after they brought in defender Alex Telles on a season-long loan from Manchester United on Thursday and centre-back Marcao from Galatasaray last month.
Isco confirmed his departure from Real Madrid in May after nine successful years in the Spanish capital, winning 19 trophies including three league titles, five Champions League trophies and four Club World Cups.
The 30-year-old, who spent two seasons at Malaga and also played for Valencia, made more than 350 appearances and scored 53 goals for Real.
However, he was sparingly used by manager Carlo Ancelotti last season, playing only 17 times in all competitions as Real won the league title and the Champions League.
Isco, capped 38 times by Spain, has worked with Sevilla boss Julen Lopetegui twice before — with the national team in the build-up to the 2018 World Cup and later that year during the Spanish manager’s brief spell in charge at Real.
The Andalusian club, who finished fourth in the league last season, begin the new campaign with a trip to Osasuna on Friday.

20,Nishioka stuns Rublev to book Washington final with Kyrgios,WASHINGTON: Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka shocked eighth-ranked Andrey Rublev on Saturday to join Wimbledon runner-up...,"WASHINGTON: Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka shocked eighth-ranked Andrey Rublev on Saturday to join Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios in reaching Sunday’s ATP and WTA Washington Open men’s final with straight-set triumphs.
Nishioka, a 96th-ranked lefthander, stunned top seed Rublev 6-3, 6-4 in 80 minutes to book his first ATP final since 2020 at Delray Beach.
“Just enjoy the day tomorrow,” Nishioka said.  “Just play my best. (I’m) excited.” 
Australia’s 63rd-ranked Kyrgios ousted Sweden’s 115th-ranked Mikael Ymer 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 and reached back-to-back tour-level finals for the first time in his career.
The 27-year-old Aussie, who lost to Novak Djokovic last month in his first Grand Slam final, won the most recent of his six ATP titles at Washington in 2019.
“It was a tough-fought semi-final and I’m just happy to be in the final once again,” Kyrgios said.  “I didn’t play anywhere near my best tennis.” Nishioka, who won his only ATP title in 2018 at Shenzhen, hadn’t won a tour-level match since March when the week began but has taken five this week and will rise to at least 54th in Monday’s world rankings.
He fired only 12 winners but took full advantage of Rublev’s 33 unforced errors and converted on 4-of-5 break points.
“I tried to be a little bit aggressive, because I knew Andrey was going to play aggressive,” Nishioka said.  “I needed to play a little bit aggressive to him.” Kyrgios is 3-0 against Nishioka, most recently winning in the third round of his 2019 Washington title run.
“We’ve played many times, but he beat me every time since 16 years old,” Nishioka said.  “It’s really tough to play against him. He doesn’t have any pace. He just hits the ball so hard every time. Very tough to break his service games.
“The most important thing is I have to focus on my service games.” 
Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi, trying to end a nine-year WTA title drought at age 37, and 60th-ranked Liudmila Samsonova will meet in the women’s final at the US Open tuneup.
World number 37 Kanepi eliminated Australia’s Daria Saville 6-3, 6-1 while Samsonova routed China’s Wang Xiyu 6-1, 6-1.
Rublev, thwarted in his bid for a 12th career title and fourth of the year, fell to 1-2 against Nishioka.
Nishioka, 26, broke for a 3-1 lead, Rublev slamming his racquet to the court in frustration, and held through to claim the first set on his second ace.
After two exchanges of beaks in the second set, Nishioka broke to lead 5-4 and held to win when Rublev smashed a forehand long.
Kyrgios won the last three points in his first-set tiebreaker and took the only break of the match on a passing forehand winner in the penultimate game, firing his 10th ace to win in 94 minutes.
Kyrgios, who jumps to at least 42nd in Monday’s rankings, fired 28 winners with only 15 unforced errors and hit 71% of his first serves.
“I served pretty solid,” Kyrgios said.  “But from the back of the court I didn’t play well at all.” 
KANEPI PLAYS SMOOTH
Kanepi seeks her fifth career WTA title but her first since the 2013 Brussels Open. She won her only WTA hardcourt title at Brisbane in 2012.
“I played my best match,” Kanepi said.  “Everything was very smooth for me. I hit a lot of lines.” 
Samsonova, 23, won her only meeting with Kanepi in last year’s first round at Wimbledon. Samsonova is into her first WTA hardcourt final, having won her only prior final at last year’s German Open.
