“No other candidate within the party is strong enough to take on PPP candidate Ali Musa Gilani,” he told the media here on Monday. 
Replying to criticism from within the party that Qureshi was promoting dynastic politics, he said he would not have fielded Mehr Bano Qureshi if the party had a strong candidate against Musa Gilani. 
Qureshi said he would visit youth leaders of the party to discuss the decision with them.  
“The decision was taken to support Chairman Imran Khan’s narrative and it was a difficult decision since we are a conventional family,” he said.  
He said girls could also play their role for the betterment of the country during difficult times.  
“Women comprise more than half the population of the country and they should have equal rights. Mehr Bano will highlight social injustice against women. As she is an educated lady with a journalistic background, she can better present women’s issues,” he said. 
He said he, his son and supporters would launch a joint campaign to support his daughter while Mehr Bano would herself reach women voters. 
Mr Qureshi said the party chairman would hold a rally on Aug 13 and he would announce his action plan against the “fascist government”. 
He said they would challenge the ECP decision of accepting selective resignations in the court.  
“Mr Khan will contest election on all these nine seats if the decision was not reversed,” he said.

2,Ex-MPA Nazir Chohan gets bail in workers clash case,"His bail has been accepted against surety bonds worth Rs50,000.","LAHORE: A local court on Monday granted bail to PML-N leader Nazir Chohan in the case of an armed clash between PTI and PML-N workers during the by-election (PP-167).
His bail was accepted against surety bonds worth Rs50,000.
The ex-MPA, his son and six others were arrested in the case of an armed clash between the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and PML-N workers during the by-election (PP-167).
The ex-MPA, his son Saad Chohan, Abid Ali, Qamar Abbas, Rafaqat Ali, Qasim Ali, Hafiz Rizwan and Faisal Maqbool were booked under sections 324, 353, 186, 506-B, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code and 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 at the Chuhng police station on Aug 1 for attacking a raiding team.
An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Thursday granted bail to PML-N leader Chohan, his son and six others involved in attacking a police party during his arrest subject to submission of surety bonds of Rs100,000 each.
Meanwhile, PTI newly-elected MPA Shabir Gujjar and Nazir Chohan set aside their differences and hugged each other on the premises of the Model Town court.  
MPA Gujjar recorded his statement in the court that he had no objection to granting bail to Chohan.  
Talking to the media, he said he wanted to work for the welfare of the people of his constituency and did not want any personal rift.
He further said that they wanted to end political fights.  
The Lahore police presented Nazir Chohan in the Model Town court after completion of his four-day physical remand in the case pertaining to attempted murder registered by Johar Town police. Deputy magistrate Asif Mustafa heard the case.
Ex-MPA Chohan through his counsel Sardar Akbar Dogar requested the court to approve his post-arrest bail application.
The applicant said the court had previously turned down a request for physical remand submitted by the police.
Mr Chohan said the Chuhng police had registered a false case against him to punish him for his political allegiance.
The court granted Mr Chohan bail against surety bonds worth Rs50,000.
Chohan was among the 25 PTI ‘dissident’ lawmakers who had voted for Hamza in the Punjab chief minister’s election held in April.  
The Election Commission of Pakistan, however, de-seated him on May 23 over defection and not obeying party instructions.
On July 17, Chohan contested elections on the ticket of PML-N for the seat he had previously won for the PTI in 2018. This time, he lost.

3,Yousuf Raza Gilani questions PTI participation in by-poll,"Since PTI MNAs are not participating in NA sessions after submitting resignations, they have no right to contest by-poll, he says.","LAHORE: PPP  vice chairman and former prime minister Senator Yousuf Raza Gilani has questioned PTI participation in the National Assembly by-election.  
“Since PTI MNAs are not  participating in the assembly session after submitting their  resignations, they have no right to contest the by-election,” he told media after visiting a number of mourning processions in Multan on Monday. 
Criticizing  Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Mr Gilani said Mr Qureshi was not attending the  assembly session and how his daughter (Mehr Bano Qureshi) would take  oath as an MNA if she won the by-poll in NA-157. He said people would  vote for a candidate having the ability to represent them in the  National Assembly instead of a candidate whose party was boycotting the  assembly after submitting resignations. 
Answering a question about the acceptance of PTI MNAs’ resignations, the former premier said their members had not been presented before Speaker Raja Parvez  Ashraf for verification of their resignations and when they were called,  they refused to come. 
About inflation, he said the previous government’s agreement with the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) on tough terms and conditions was the main reason behind inflation  in the country. He said the incumbent government was bound  to honour the international agreements which were not made with a political party but with the country. Mr Gilani maintained there  should be supremacy of law and constitution to  strengthen the country. Saying that the judiciary and Election Commission of Pakistan were independent, he asserted that the PPP always  honoured the court verdicts even when he was disqualified from  prime ministership despite the fact that he was an elected prime  minister. 
He said all senior leaders of different political  parties, including Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari,  remained in jail during the PTI government. 
The PPP leader  alleged that the commissioner Multan had submitted an application for  leave due to intense pressure on him before the NA-157 by-election and  demanded that the ECP take notice of it. 
Mr Gilani urged the masses to maintain peace during ongoing Muharram.

5,Safari’s aviary no more an attraction to visitors,Sources say aviary has lost its charm because of fewer birds.,"LAHORE: The bird aviary at the Lahore Zoo Safari, which was once full of birds, has now hardly 200 or so birds.  
Sources told Dawn that the aviary, which once was one of the most attractive parts of the Lahore Zoo Safari, had lost its charm because of fewer birds. The two pairs of macaws the aviary had died two and a half years ago and the facility did not bring the new macaws.  
The iron net sprawling over the aviary is in a state of disrepair as it was last installed in 2005.  
The aviary spread over two and-a -half acre has love birds, grey parrots, peafowl, pheasants, cranes, ducks, swans, partridges and other such birds. 
Tanveer Janjua, Safari in-charge, said the head office had been informed about the condition of the facility. He said aviary had developed cracks for being old. “We are doing repairs of the net to improve it,’’ said Janjua. He said that in future there are plans that the Safari would remain open till 10pm. And people could visit lion safari at night, he added.  
There’s plan to open a food street at the facility to attract more visitors, he added. 
Deputy Director Wildlife Headquarters Mudassar Hassan said having exotic birds in the aviary was possible with the availability of funds. 
“However, we have brought many new birds in the aviary and we are trying our best to have more beautiful birds.” As the new iron net over the aviary would cost a lot of money, the department had done necessary repairs and it was safe now, he said.  
He said landscaping of the aviary was also being done and birds such as pheasants, ducks and peacocks had been inducted in the aviary.

6,The logic behind ancient monuments of Lahore,"By understanding the reason monuments were created for, we might strongly feel the reasons they should be conserved and restored.","There is always logic as to why a building or a monument is located at any particular place or built in a certain time period. Sometimes the reason can be merely a display of power, though mostly it is a utilitarian reason. 
The architecture of a building or monument exposes its geographic and period influence. The old Lahore has a lot of historic buildings and the ones spared so far by our trader classes need to be understood. By understanding the reason they were created for, we might strongly feel the reasons they should be conserved and restored. 
Just a few things need to be made clear before we set off describing our subject monument in this piece. Religious monuments like temples, mosques, gurdwaras and churches abound in Lahore. Their time period matters while population mix matters the most as survival of a religious monument depends on the toleration levels of the ruling classes. 
But until 1947, the Walled City of Lahore, and Lahore outside the walls too, was not a Muslim majority area. Western Punjab certainly was. That’s why the mix promoted tolerance, which was once the hallmark of the city. Mind you, over the ages Lahore has been a Jain city, for 700 years a Buddhist city, a Hindu city and then, finally, a Muslim city as it is now. 
The oldest surviving mosque of Lahore is the ‘Neeven Masjid,’ followed by the first mosque that served the Mughal rulers, the Mori Masjid, built in 1630. That was followed by the mosque built by Emperor Akbar’s beautiful wife Mariam Zamani, located to the south-east of the Lahore Fort, but far away from the then Walled City. 
At this point, we need to understand that even the beautiful Mariam Zamani Mosque did not have a courtyard to accommodate even 250 persons. This merely meant that on Fridays, a royal entourage would leave Akbari Gate of the fort (The Alamgiri Gate did not exist then) and head for this small mosque. It was this compelling reason that there was a need for a large mosque with enough space in its courtyard to accommodate the Muslims of old Lahore. 
Thus we have the Subedar of Lahore, the Governor, Hakeem Ilumuddin Ansari, known better today as Wazir Khan who decided that he would build the largest mosque of Lahore in an open space in the new expanded eastern portion of the Walled City. The reason was that as Muslim numbers expanded, more space for collective worship was needed. 
Here we must make it clear that the Muslims were buried outside the ancient walled city then as we can see from the example of Ayaz, the handsome Georgian slave of the Turko-Afghan invader Mahmud of Ghazni. Today, his grave is in Rang Mahal and a part of the expanded old city. Same was the case with other Muslims. 
In the earlier Tughlaq period, we have the saint-seer Syed Ishaq Garezuni, better known as Miran Shah, also buried beyond where Ayaz was buried. Near this grave was that of Syed Suf, a follower of Miran Shah. They both played a huge part in explaining Islam to the people of Lahore. Nearby were other graves of the Muslims but far away from the original ancient walled city. We all know that Ali Hajveri was also buried a distance away from the south of the ancient city. 
Come the expansion and there was a huge open space – a garden – that was provided to the Subedar Wazir Khan by the emperor Shah Jahan, whom he had served since his childhood. In 1620, Wazir Khan was made a ‘Panj Hazari’ – a 5,000 horsemen cavalry leader. Once Shah Jahan came to power, Wazir Khan looked after the residential quarters inside the Lahore Fort. 
Ultimately, he was made the Subedar of Lahore and played a major role in bringing the emperor’s wife Mumtaz Mahal’s body from Burhanpur to Agra where ultimately he played a major role in the building the Taj Mahal. His role in the building of a few monuments like Naulakha in the Fort showed his taste and skill of putting together large monuments. 
Now he set about building a large mosque in the space provided as well as a Hamman inside Delhi Gateway to refresh and cleanse royalty as they entered Lahore after a long dusty journey. The building of the mosque posed a major problem for the once outside Muslim graveyard had two important graves there, those of Miran Shah and Syed Suf. Added to this were the Kakayzai inhabitants of the bazaar behind the planned mosque who held the two saints in high esteem. They immediately issued a ‘fatwa’ and work could not start. So a series of meetings among the Muslims of the area as well as Hindus, who held the saints in high esteem, set about. Ultimately, a solution was arrived at and the two saints were promised a marble tomb within the courtyard. 
As the outer surface had since risen, a two-tier grave monument was made but within the courtyard in such a way that it did not hinder the total design. Amazingly, the outer tomb was rebuilt in the British days over the lower courtyard from where a staircase leads to the original graves. 
Just a digression. If you notice that the foundations of the Shahi Hamman are a good 12 feet below the current upper road surface, we have the ‘Neeven Masjid’ existing 25 feet below the outer road surface as it is today. This reflects Lahore’s constant surface rise because of the environment being very dusty. This dust can be clearly seen by those flying into the city on aircraft. 
We will leave the architectural details for another time but what we know is that the Wazir Khan Mosque provided the people of Lahore with its first open courtyard for prayers. Small mosques had also come up but not for large collective worship. Here we see the last major Mughal emperor Aurangzeb come into play. His contribution was the Badshahi Mosque opposite the Lahore Fort as well as the massive Alamgiri Gateway of the fort. It was a contribution that today stands out. Experts point out that both monuments of Aurangzeb are more a display of power than of any other consideration. 
The ancient Walled City has so many such graves and temples that need immediate attention. They remind of an era where Lahore emerged as one of the great cities of the world. If only we can depend on archaeological and historic research to solve our past mysteries. There is just so much to learn.

10,The business of giving a makeover to resting place,"Labourer says for last 15 years, he has been regularly camping at Mai Shah's graveyard during Muharram and repairing graves.","SAHIWAL: Ali Ahmed with his wife Hafeezain Bibi and their three children arrives from village 79/4-R to Mai Shah graveyard for the repair of graves in the first 10 days of Muharram. 
The people visiting the graves of their near and dear ones hire the couple to give a makeover to the resting places with a fresh layer of clay mixed with straws. 
Ali is not alone to offer his services at the cemetery. More than 100 labourers from surrounding villages camp at the site during Ashura on Jamia Rasheedia Road for mud paste of graves. 
They say that each family earns Rs3,000 to Rs4,000 daily. 
There is a tradition among families to visit graveyards and throw flowers on the graves of their family members during Muharram and Eid days. This is the occasion when they get graves repaired, which are damaged due to rains.  
Mai Shah’s graveyard is a house to both Shia and Sunni people’s graves. 
Chaudhry Latif said most of the families visit the graves of their dear ones during Muharram and on Eid days and get them repaired annually. 
Saima Ahmed along with her nine-year-old daughter Ramsha arrived from Farid Town at the grave of her parents, aunt and uncle to pay them respect on Muharram 9.  
She said she bought flowers to place on graves. Later, many labourers surrounded her, offering their services for mud pasting of graves. 
Labourer Ali told Dawn that for the last 15 years, he has regularly been camping at the graveyard during Muharram and repairing graves.  
His wife Hafeezain Bibi said it was difficult to stay at makeshift places on the road in humid weather but they would earn more than Rs20,000 in these 10 days. 
Their day starts with a humble breakfast of tea and biscuits. Later on, they feed the family on the charity food which is dished out by visitors. 
Ali said he and his wife actually are road labourers and are employed in Mirpurkhas and Muzaffarabad with different road contractors. 
He charges Rs300 to Rs500 for one grave’s paste. They have a plastic bag, a plastic cane and a bag of dry straw. Once the deal is struck, Ali fetches water while Hafeezan prepares clay. The couple pastes the clay on graves while their children watch them work.

12,Drugs are just a phone call away in Sialkot,Issue highlighted after video clip showing minor girl taking drugs under Shahabpura overhead bridge goes viral on social media.,"NAROWAL: Drug peddlers are operating in different areas of Sialkot city without any check by the police concerned, causing concern among the citizens, especially the parents of youngsters who are becoming addicts due to easy availability of drugs.  
The issue was highlighted recently after a video clip showing a minor girl taking drugs under the Shahabpura overhead bridge in the middle of Sialkot city went viral on social media. 
According to locals, the drug dealers are openly selling ice, heroine, marijuana, besides local and imported liquor, to the youth in the city, while the police were just looking other way or in some cases patronising such elements.  
They say that a group of influential dealers has hired youngsters, who are called ‘shooters’, for delivering drugs to their customers at their doorstep on a phone call.  
They deplored that instead of taking action against these drug dealers, some police officials were conniving with such elements to keep the illegal trade running.  
They say that on being pressurised by senior police officers for action against big dealers, the officials at police station level only book addicts in drug cases, showing recovery of small quantities of narcotics to show their performance.     
They say following such fake recoveries, local police issue press releases to satisfy their high-ups, but the actual peddlers keep operating freely.  
They regretted that because of home delivery of drugs, a large number of youngsters are becoming addicts in Sialkot, adding that the girl’s video clip that went viral just showed the tip of the iceberg, while the ground reality was far more grave.    
An other resident, Mujahid Ali, says the drug dealers enjoy police patronage and some police officials have also become investors in the narcotics business.  
He says the boundaries of two police stations -- Agoki and Hajipura -- converge at Shahabpura overhead bridge, where dozens of addicts take drugs openly but no action is taken.  
Sialkot District Police Officer Syed Zeeshan Raza said the police were taking strict action against the drug dealers, adding that he had sought a report on the girl’s drug taking video clip.
The citizens demanded Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi should take immediate notice of the situation and order the police to act against the drug peddlers.

16,Lahore bridge expansion may complete by September-end,Project will ease traffic flow from Kalma Chowk to Gajjumata.,"LAHORE: The construction of the Lahore bridge (Qainchi intersection, Ferozpur Road) expansion project is likely to be completed by end of next month, as around 75 per cent of work has been done.  
The project lingered on owing to delay in issuance of NOC from Pakistan Railways, shifting of utility services and other technical issues, it is learnt.  
“I don’t think the project will complete by end of the ongoing month. However, I can say that we will complete and open this to traffic by September-end subject to having an impediment-free environment,” Project Director Mobeen Asghar said while talking to Dawn on Monday.  
The Lahore bridge expansion is a part of the Rs1.711 billion Gulab Devi underpass project. The underpass was opened to traffic a couple of months ago while work on the bridge expansion couldn’t pick momentum due to delay in NOC from the Pakistan Railways that was supposed to allow the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) to carry out piling, girder launching while crossing over the railway lines at the intersection.  

Project will ease traffic flow from Kalma Chowk to Gajjumata

The need for Lahore bridge emerged after the LDA in a survey, prior to launch of the project, came to know that the traffic heading towards Gajjumata and Kasur from Kalma Chowk stuck at the existing Lahore bridge due to low width of the road (two lanes). However, there is no issue with traffic proceeding towards Kalma chowk from Gajjumata and Kasur while passing this spot as this side of the bridge has a three-lane road stretch.
“Keeping in view this, we decided to expand the bridge (the two-lane side heading towards Gajjumata, Kasur) by construction another two-lane flyover along with the existing one with a space of one meter. And finally we launched the construction work side by side the work on the Gulab Devi underpass,” Mr Asghar explained.  
He said work related to the addition of a two-lane overhead bridge along with the existing one remained slow because of the NOC issue. Meanwhile, the project team was also not allowed to get the construction carried out on a regular basis due to non-observance of power shutdown in a bid to avert possibility of electrocution-related incidents, shifting of poles, wires, cables due to various reasons - Ramazan, Eid, Muharram and hot weather.  
“The Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) is yet to shift a heavy tower of 132kV transmission line. Moreover, the shifting of Sui gas-related services are also to be done,” he said, adding that the curing of pilings, girders also takes time.
“Hopefully, we will be able to complete this portion of the project by end of next month, as there is no hurdle at the moment,” he said.  
Asghar said with the addition of two more lanes, the issues related to traffic congestion at this point would come to an end.  
LDA’s newly-appointed DG Aamir Ahmad Khan also inspected the project a couple of days back. During the visit, he was briefed by LDA Chief Engineer (II) Mazhar Hussain Khan about the pace of work, delay, future strategy for completion of the project.  
The DG directed the chief engineer, project director and others concerned to accelerate construction work and complete the project at the earliest.  
It merits mentioning that the LDA also faced issues related to shifting of electricity, gas services, non-observance of shutdowns, land acquisition while implementing the Shahkam Chowk flyover that was finally opened to traffic on July 8.  
The Rs4.233bn Shahkam Chowk flyover project had been launched on-time in July last year. However, the land acquisition (64 kanal) was delayed for some time due to procedural issues.  
According to official sources, the Rs4.3bn Saggian Road Rehabilitation Project would also be completed soon as the work is under way these days.  
In May, the newly-constructed Rs5bn Sheranwala Gate flyover project had also been opened to traffic, easing mobility of the people crossing the area to reach Ravi Road. However, some at-grade works including the allied ones - construction of a road with protected U-turns, slip roads, concrete pavement, shifting of utility services were completed later.

17,Distance-based fares sought for Orange Line train,Transport operators in May raised fares by 20pc on all intercity and intracity routes across Punjab.,"LAHORE: The Punjab Masstransit Authority (PMA) has urged the government to allow it to introduce a distance-based fare for travelling by the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train keeping in view massive surge in the administrative and operational expenses.  
The authority also plans to revive a summary it had already tabled before the cabinet of last Punjab government led by Hamza Shehbaz Sharif, Dawn has learnt. 
“In fact, the authority had first taken up this matter with the Buzdar-led PTI government, explaining that the orange line train fares immediately need to be rationalised by abolishing the flat fare system. The authority had also proposed introduction of a distance-based fare from Rs20 to 40 (Rs20 stop to stop and increase gradually with distance) on over 27km-long route of the orange line starting from Dera Gujjaran to Ali Town via GT Road, Lakshami, GPO, Anarkali, Chauburji, Multan Road and Raiwind Road,” a senior official told Dawn on Sunday. 
The official said the Buzdar government had agreed to increase it to take out the PMA from increasing financial burden. But it couldn’t do so after a change in the government. After formation of the new government led by Hamza Shehbaz, the authority took up this issue with it. And finally this government asked the PMA to table a summary to the provincial cabinet through the transport department.  
“We prepared a summary seeking introduction of a stop-to-stop fare of Rs20 and sent it to the transport department for onward submission to the cabinet. The department after going through it tabled it before the then cabinet,” the official maintained, adding that the cabinet couldn’t take any decision.  
He said the PMA had now decided to brief the new transport minister on its roles and responsibilities besides requesting him to get this summary approved by the new cabinet.  
The PMA, according to the provincial government, is a statutory body established with the purpose of planning, construction, operation and maintenance of mass transit systems in the major cities of the province for providing safe, efficient and comfortable urban transportation system.  
Since the authority is supposed to focus on planning, contracting of services and oversight of contracts/operations, it, under the existing operational model, has outsourced all of its operation and maintenance services to tap the private sector efficiency.  
“Increase or rationalising or introduction of a distance-based fare has been initially proposed for the orange line alone under phase-1. The same fare model may also be applied to the Lahore, Rawalpindi-Islamabad and Multan Metro Bus systems and the Speedo bus service in Lahore and Multan under phase-2,” the official hinted.  
The transport operators in May raised fares by 20 per cent on all intercity and intracity routes across the province after first increase in the POL prices was made by Shehbaz-led government. Pakistan Railways (PR), later, also increased fares on all passenger and freight trains by 10 to 20 per cent with effect from June 1. The PMA also worked out a proposal seeking rationalisation of fare of the orange line keeping in view the increasing electricity cost but it is yet to be approved by the government.

More than 10,000 police officers will perform security duties on Muharram nine and 10 and the Punjab government also imposed a ban on pillion riding during Ashura.
Furthermore, mobile phone service will be suspended on the routes of the main processions on Ashur day at specific times and the program organizers have been directed to ensure adherence to the code of conduct, route and timings
Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Ghulam Mehmood said more than 10,000 policemen, including 14 SPs, 40 DSPs, 99 inspectors, 810 upper subordinates along with 370 female police personnel and anti-riot force would perform duty on Youm-i-Ashur to provide foolproof security to the mourners of majalis and processions as well as citizens.
More than 125 mourning processions and 600 Majalis would be held on Muharram nine and 10. As many as 3,868 Majalis and 460 mourning processions would be held during Ashura, whereas there are 5,235 majalis and 650 mourning processions in the complete month of Muharram.

23,Roadside vendors bear the brunt of traffic load management drive,"LAHORE: “I’ve suffered huge losses multiple times because the metropolitan corporation teams suddenly appear,...","LAHORE: “I’ve suffered huge losses multiple times because the metropolitan corporation teams suddenly appear, remove my counter from outside the shop, destroy it and don’t even compensate for it. I’ve to first pay a fine to get its remains back from the corporation and then get it fixed, all of which takes days during which my business remains closed and costs me around Rs12,000. I don’t even make this much money a month,” lamented Amjad, a roadside fast food vendor in the Chah Miran area.
Amjad is one of many such vendors and pushcart owners who have had their infrastructure removed during the joint ‘traffic load management’ drive of the Metropolitan Corporation Lahore (MCL) along with traffic police, Lahore Development Authority and other departments under way over the past few months on 24 major roads of the city.
While the authorities claim their only objective is to ensure smooth flow of traffic and they would remove anything that hampers vehicular movement, most of the affectees are small vendors who don’t own proper shops and only rely on their makeshift counters, kiosks, stalls and carts to eke out a living. Once these are snatched from them, they do everything in their limited means to resume business.
Amjad says the anti-encroachment teams never warn or issue prior notices.
“My counter was just a few inches over the footpath, still they picked it up and smashed it. I have no other source of income so I had to pay the fine, get its pieces back and have it repaired,” he says.
A lemon soda seller in the Thokar Niaz Baig area has a similar tale to tell.
“All of us in the area got our counters back after paying fines between Rs2,000 and Rs5,000 and resumed our business at the same spot,” says Zeeshan, also speaking for the halwa puri, gol gappay and other vendors around him.
When asked if they have any objection to moving away from the roadsides to dedicated spots, he says it’s not about alternate locations.
“They bother us everywhere. These officials only want money no matter where we set up our stalls. When they run out of money, they look for setups to raid on. They even take monthly bribe from us on the pretext of sparing us the raids, yet remove our counters. Even traffic isn’t an issue. We have wide roads in Lahore; it’s all about money,” the vendor tries to make a case for him.
Roadside vendors and pushcart owners in Mughalpura, The Mall and Lakshmi Chowk all resumed their activities at their original locations after paying a few thousands in fine just a couple of days after their setups were removed by the administration. These ordeals raise multiple questions – the efficacy of such drives; absence of dedicated spaces for these low-income traders where they don’t create ‘traffic nuisance’, as the authorities claim; need to create awareness among them; lack of urban planning and an encroachment policy, and standardised times for roadside businesses among others.
While the local administration says it doesn’t want to disturb the roadside business in a country where social welfare is booming and would rather adjust them appropriately, development experts say city management and not master planning is urgently required.
Ali Abbas Bukhari, the chief metropolitan officer, tells Dawn no poor person has been targeted but only illegal parking and bus stands, stalls and construction material shops. As for roadside vendors, only those that create repeated traffic nuisance are removed.
“First we surveyed illegal parking stands on each road, and then removed them, registered cases against shopkeepers, and also sealed many shops. Since it’s a traffic load management drive, anything that hampers smooth flow will be removed, and we have somewhat succeeded in our target on the 24 roads we selected but it’s a continuous process.”
When asked if roadside vendors could be allocated a particular space where they can smoothly operate from without hindering traffic flow, he says fancy model pushcarts for Rs50,000 each have been designed with the help of philanthropists.
“Footpaths should be cleared either way and timings could be assigned to them to begin their activities in the evening, as our regulations say. We have set up 50 so far at five spots and will gradually replace the remaining also as is the practice around the world. We have tried to model some markets on this pattern, including Moon Market in Iqbal Town and Gulshan-i-Ravi, and plan to replicate this in other markets. This is just the beginning because there must be around 3,000-4,000 such vendors around Lahore,” he explained.
An MCL official, who didn’t want to be named, admits that besides fines, the vendors pay monthly bribe to the corporation officials and, in many cases, the shopkeepers and residences outside which these counters are set up are also involved as well as area unions.
“Besides, if all traffic wardens deputed in an area perform their duties, half the problems will be solved,” he remarked.
Noted economist and vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, Dr Nadeemul Haque, is of the idea that master planning of cities is nonsense and it’s just a way for consultants to make money. In the absence of many facilities like spaces for walking and cycling to cut down on pollution, what’s needed is city management.
“Master planners decide how you and I are going to live; nobody can decide that because if cities can be planned, so can the countries. There’s a shortage of all kinds of facilities but loads of space for cars and then we say kiosks and counters or tables and chairs outside a small hotel are encroachments. What we need is city management. They need to manage their own services and the way they work, and not manage people,” he asserts.
Mr Haque tells Dawn the administrators need to “let our cities grow upwards, let people have flats” because, he believes, Lahore will be unlivable in six months because of pollution.
“They have made it a ‘car city’ because of which we can’t have roadside vendors. We need sidewalks, walking tracks, cycle friendly roads, kiosks etc.”

24,Punjab notes: Baba Farid’s legacy: distortion and subversion,Baba Farid (1188-1280 AD) is the first major poet of contemporary Punjabi language who is undisputedly accepted as a...,"Baba Farid (1188-1280 AD) is the first major poet of contemporary Punjabi language who is undisputedly accepted as a trailblazer.
He composed ‘Shlokas’/couplets) which have proved to be inexhaustible source of inspiration for all poets to come. ‘Shloka’ is an ancient poetic genre first introduced by sage Valmiki, the immortal author of Ramayana. It’s reported that when Valmiki had heard and learnt the oral story of the Lord Rama, he went to a river for a dip. He saw a pair of mating cranes in an ecstasy singing and dancing. A Nishada hunter killed the male crane with his deadly arrow. The female finding her partner bloodied writhing on the ground incessantly cried. Valmiki overwhelmed by compassion thought that killing a singing bird in the act of mating was not dharma. Moved by the cries of female crane, he spontaneously cursed the hunter: “Nishada, you would never be able to find peace because you shot down the male of the pair who had a surge of desire.” Suddenly Valmiki felt that he had spoken in verse and in a meter that he called Shloka. It was called Shloka because he uttered it in sorrow (shoka). The happening inspired him to compose his Ramayana. The word ‘Shoka/ shok’ in in the meaning of sorrow and grief is found in Zend / Avista and Persian languages as ‘Sog’.  
In Punjabi, we also use ‘Sog’ for mourning, sorrow and grief. It implies that genre of Shloka is meant for serious and thoughtful and thought-provoking poetry. Baba Farid’s Shlokas are austere but carry multiple layers of rich meanings which provoke and challenge the readers. Simplicity is simply deceptive. Had another great sage not collected his verses, they perhaps would have been lost.  
It was Baba Guru Nanak who collected and collated the poetry of great poets and saints including that of Baba Farid which later became an integral part of holy Sikh scripture ‘Guru Granth Sahib’ and got preserved for all times to come.
Spiritual vision coupled with concrete and mundane experiences permeate his poetic world as expressed in his verses. He emphatically stresses the virtues of simple life i.e. demanding and accepting as much as is genuinely needed for human life. Less is as detrimental to human growth as is more. Less leads to human impoverishment and more to waste of human and natural resources. While living a very austere life, he never forgets to emphasise the role of economic needs in human society and the importance of sharing. So much so that he declares that Islamic faith has six tenets, not five. The sixth one is roti which means food, provisions signifying the fulfillment of economic needs of an individual. And it is declared by a man who survives on the bare minimum out of his choice. His unequivocal stance on class oppression is loud and clear. See how his symbolism juxtaposes the deprivation of the masses with the life of indulgence of the elite: “Farida, roti maeri kaath di, laavan maeri bhukh / Jinhaan khaadi chopri, ghaney sahin gay dukh (O Farid, wood is my bread, hunger for curry I’ve got / Those who ‘ve eaten it rich, dense pains their lot (Trans: Muzzaffar Ghaffaar).”  
He unambiguously stands against exploitation and firmly sides with the oppressed. He debunks and denounces the oppressors who make life miserable for the people. It’s people who work hard, produce and create. He exposes the parasitic landlords and plunderers. “O Farid, these stalks being cooked though sugar-coated are poison / Some dropped dead toiling, some laid waste the crops” he says.  
Farmer traditionally has been the target of landlords, plunderers and invaders in our part of the world as he was the major producer of the surplus in pre-industrial age. The bulk of economy comprised agricultural products and livestock. The dichotomy was that who produced most was the most deprived as each powerful segment of society wanted its pound of flesh from the peasant.  
Another couplet says: “O Farid, some have measureless flour, some not even salt / Going ahead they’ll sense, who will bear the assault (Trans: Muzzaffar Ghaffaar).” 
He was as bold as a priest in medieval Europe who addressing a gathering of aristocrats said: “Gentlemen, you are not thieves but what you eat is fruit of theft.” One of Baba Farid’s disciples who had gone to eastern part of India after his studies, wrote him a letter with the request that he be guided as to how to conduct his affairs. The master replied that his (disciple’s) studies would provide the guidance. However, he wrote, he knew one thing: “A scholar’s knowledge drops dead when he knocks at a rich man’s door.” Now his descendants and custodians of his shrines stand for the values and practice a way of life which contradict what the sage upheld and practiced. One wonders how with the passage of time the legacy of a poet and sage who aligned himself with the people’s position has turned into its opposite? This sadly has happened with all others who had similar kind of worldview. The shrine is now a sanctuary that breeds superstition like other innumerable shrines that dot the country’s landscape. People, rich and poor, in search of a magical solution of their problems, visit the shrine of a man who exhorted: “You shriek O Farid, shriek like the keeper of the maize /Until the harvest ripens, shriek till then raise.” He points to the critical role consciousness and self-awareness play in the human growth. But now non-existent mysterious forces are touted as an arbiter of human destiny. The reasons for the decay are not unfathomable. Sage’s grave became a sacred shrine revered by common people he identified with all his life. For the custodians and descendants, it became an undying source of unearned income; people would make offerings in shape of money. The elite in order to be seen pious offered - still offers - lands and expensive gifts making the caretakers and their families rich and a part of the ruling segment. So the class concern of rich and powerful has blunted the revolutionary edge of Baba Farid’s vision; it’s subversion of the sublime and the mundane found in his creative expression. Consequently, the stress is on the rituals performed at the shrine, not on his poetry which is undoubtedly a beacon of hope for the wretched of the earth. — soofi01@hotmail.com

“Lack of democracy within political parties is turning them into family-owned enterprises and is failing to provide training platforms to the workers for a democratic setup at national level,” observes former National Assembly speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussain at a sitting of the National Public Forum, a political think-tank, here on Sunday.
He stressed that there should be internal democracy in the parties for establishing a model democracy in the country.
He urged that the armed forces should neither be discussed unnecessarily nor these should be dragged into political affairs.
Participants of the forum, in a joint declaration, demanded that all parliamentary forces should immediately initiate a dialogue to steer the country out of the worst economic and political crises it is facing.
The meeting also strongly condemned the negative social media campaign going on in the wake of the Lasbela helicopter incident.
Lt-Gen (retired) Ghulam Mustafa said that CPEC projects would have to be made 100 percent functional for retiring national debt. 
Forum Chairman Mian Manzoor Ahmed Wattoo said it was painful to see that political, democratic leaders were not ready even to shake hands with each other. “Who would run the country if the situation sustained,” he asked.
He said the Turks laid down under the tanks to protect democracy only because the political leadership of Turkiye enjoyed their trust.
Columnist Hafeezullah Niazi said the root cause of each issue was political instability.
Senior journalist Suhail Warraich said he along with Mujeebur Rehman Shami had met with Imran Khan before the recent political change in Punjab and that he found the PTI chairman positive about talks with political rivals.

More than 500 mourners, including women and children, staged a sit-in in the Main Bazaar of the village and demanded cleaning of the route by the district administration. They condemned the apathy of the local administration as they had submitted written complaints over the issue to both the district council as well as the district administration.  
Zeeshan Bukahri, the organiser of the procession, protested against the nonprofessional approach of the district council chief for not dispatching teams to clear the route.  
Speaking at the occasion, he said the junior staff failed to implement the orders of the district administration. He informed Dawn that one month back, he had submitted different applications to Commissioner Salwat Saeed and the district administration for cleaning the route but no action was taken. He said he called on District Police Officer Sadiq Baloch also and asked for his favour.

31,Ahsan Iqbal predicts improved economy as rupee recovers,Says govt to complete term as polls impossible before next August.,"NAROWAL: Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal says the value of rupee is recovering fast against US dollar and the economy will improve in the next few months. 
“The government’s first priority is to stabilise the country’s economy and all institutions are working on one platform to strengthen it,” he declared while talking to the media in tehsil Shakargarh on Sunday. 
Mr Iqbal said the government would complete its term to fulfill the constitutional requirements.  
“If we go for elections immediately, there will be uncertainty in the country for the next four months. Three months will be spent in the election and one month in the formation of the government.” 
The federal minister said the process of new census had started and it would be completed by February 2023. He said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) needed four months to make new constituencies under the new census and the entire process would be completed by August 2023. He said all the political parties, especially of the Sindh province, were of the opinion that the upcoming elections should be held according to the new census. He declared that the federal government would complete its term to fulfill constitutional requirements.  

Says govt to complete term as polls impossible before next August

Ahsan Iqbal claimed that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government had left the country on the brink of destruction. Just 10 days before the start of the coalition government, he said, the former ministry of finance had announced that the country did not have enough money for installments of development budgets, which meant that the country’s treasury was empty and there were fears that Pakistan would default like Sri Lanka within days or weeks.  
“Today no one is saying that Pakistan is going to become Sri Lanka. The rupee which Imran Khan’s government had left on the slope in its last days is going to strengthen. In a few days, the rupee has restored its value against the dollar.” 
Mr Iqbal said that during the next few months, Pakistan’s economy would become stronger with further improvement.  
He said that all institutions, including the administrative machinery, the parliament, federal cabinet and the army, were playing their role equally in the country. He expressed hope that all would get Pakistan out of trouble and put the country back on the path of development with joint efforts.  
Ahsan Iqbal asked whether the man who committed corruption of billions of rupees, betrayed the people’s trust, took funding from the enemies of the country, made deals on the China Pakistan Economic Corridor and Kashmir with external funding and spread chaos in the country was worthy of following. He said the MNAs and MPAs of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had taken oaths of allegiance to the Constitution of Pakistan but not of personal loyalty to Imran Khan.  
Referring to Imran Khan, the minister declared that the man who disobeyed the Constitution and law of the country was not worthy to be supported.
