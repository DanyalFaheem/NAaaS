1,Victim families await justice as 2009 Ashura blast case file gathers dust,"13 years on, no progress made to arrest absconders; three ‘Jundullah militant’ reportedly killed.","KARACHI: Senior journalist and Karachi bureau chief of Geo News Faheem Siddiqui is busy in planning for the coverage of the religious events of Ashura in the city. However, the activity every year reminds him of the painful events of 2009 Muharram he would never want to repeat in his life as a father, but has to go through as a newsman. 
“Obviously, it causes pain. I lost my first child on this day. I lost my niece too,” says Mr Siddiqui referring to the Ashura bomb blast in which more than 45 people were killed on M.A. Jinnah Road on December 28, 2009. Mr Siddiqui’s six-year-old son, Bazil Ahmed Siddiqui, and 13-year-old niece, Anzalna Hanif, were among those killed in the attack. 
“We remained issueless for five years after the martyrdom of our son,” the 49-year-old tells Dawn in a gagged voice. Then, Allah, the Almighty, blessed us with three kids, all of them are boys,” he says. “But, the pain for losing our firstborn still haunts us. If Bazil were alive, he would have been 19 today,” adds the father, helplessly. 
Mr Siddiqui is among dozens of families of the victims of the tragic incident that shook the nation in general. And they are all awaiting justice for the past 13 years, as the country’s security establishment fails to re-arrest the three Jundullah militants allegedly involved in the bombing, who had escaped from the custody of the police days after their arrest. 

13 years on, no progress made to arrest absconders; three ‘Jundullah militant’ reportedly killed

The high-profile Ashura bombing case files are gathering dust in the storeroom of an antiterrorism court (ATC) as Rangers and police are yet to re-arrest the suspects, who had escaped from City Courts. 
Four Jundullah men — Murtaza alias Shakil, Mohammad Saqib Farooqui, Wazir Mohammad and Murad Shah — were arrested in January 2010 and booked in four cases pertaining to a series of attacks on Muharram processions in Karachi in 2009.
“The four cases pertaining to the targeted attacks on the mourning processions, including the one on the main Ashura procession, remain shelved in the court’s custody since October 2010 for want of accused,” judicial staffers told Dawn. 
Witnesses had reportedly identified four detained suspects during an identification parade held before a judicial magistrate at a pre-trial stage in the cases, according to prosecution officials. 
The Jundullah militants, who were arrested after a shoot-out at Hawkesbay in 2010 and had allegedly confessed to the attacks, had escaped from the City Court the same year. 
All the suspects were reportedly got freed from police custody by their accomplices after a gun attack on the premises of the crowded City Courts judicial complex on M. A. Jinnah Road, where the police had produced them in another case registered against them by the Anti-Car Lifting Cell on June 20, 2010. 
Case still on dormant file
One of the four suspects, Murad Shah, was killed while fleeing, but his alleged accomplices were never caught again. 
“After the suspects managed to flee, the investigating officer (IO) informed the ATC-III about it,” said an official. 
“Subsequently, the court kept the cases ‘dormant’ because the police and other law enforcement agencies have yet to show any progress regarding the arrest of the suspects, who remain at large after a decade,” added the official. 
“The case is still ‘dormant’, as there is no progress till the day,” a judicial official at the trial court told Dawn. “It means the accused are still absconding and have not been brought to the court,” the official added. 
The trial court had issued life warrants for the arrest of the three suspects on Oct 7, 2010 directing the police to produce them in court “as soon as possible”. 
The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of police had at the time of their arrest claimed that the suspects were ‘high-profile’ criminals associated with the proscribed outfit. However, they were not tried in a court inside the central prison and jail authorities sent them to the city courts without making proper security arrangements. 
It was the responsibility of the IOs to ask or recommend to the home department through a letter to notify the jail trial of hardened criminals in high-profile cases or if the jail authorities had insufficient security arrangement to take them to courts. 
Delay favours accused
Legal experts believed that the prolonged suspension of the proceedings in such high-profile cases always benefited the accused party as prosecution witnesses might change their residences or go underground. 
Also, it is hard for a witness to remember the exact evidence for years while it is also a difficult task for the IOs to maintain the case property, police files and stay in touch with their witnesses, they added. 
The SIU arrested the suspected militants following a shoot-out on Hawkesbay Road on Jan 23, 2010 and claimed that they had allegedly confessed to have carried out the attacks on the Muharram processions. 
Subsequently, they were charge-sheeted under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 and their cases were sent to the ATC-III for trial. However, they escaped before their indictment. 
Murtaza and Saqib were booked for killing over 45 people and wounding about 100 others in the bomb attack on the main Ashura procession on Dec 28, 2009. 
Police filed a charge sheet against the duo in the Paposh Nagar blast that took place on Dec 26, 2009 when an 8th Muharram procession was passing by and it left 13 people wounded. 
They also filed a charge sheet against deceased Murad Shah in a case pertaining to a low-intensity blast that targeted a 9th Muharram procession in Qasba Colony on Dec 27, 2009. 
Besides, the four suspects were also booked in a case registered under Sections 4/5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908 read with Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the ATA at the Sir Syed police station, as the police claimed to have recovered explosive material on a lead provided by them. 
Prosecutor general says absconders killed Sindh Prosecutor General Dr Faiz Shah had last year made a disclosure about the three fleeing suspects by saying that “they were also killed in a shootout with law-enforcers”. 
Without elaborating further, Mr Shah had said that according to the IO of the case the absconding suspects had been killed in an encounter. 
Talking to Dawn, Dr Shah said that the “situation is the same” and the case was still dormant as there was no progress.
After the lapse of 13 years, Mr Shah’s claim gives the case yet another interesting twist as to whether the law-enforcers have failed to re-arrest the fleeing suspects or they have been killed in an encounter. 
In both conditions, the relatives of the victims as well as the survivors of the main Ashura attack still await justice. 
Back in his office, journalist Siddiqui is not only preparing himself for the coverage of this year’s Ashura procession, but also bracing himself to go through the same pain yet again.

2,Guard arrested for beating pregnant woman in Karachi's Jauhar area,"“Police have taken action on a viral video on social media wherein a guard is seen torturing a woman,” says East-SSP.","KARACHI: A private security guard was arrested on charges of beating a pregnant woman after CCTV footage of the incident went viral on social media, prompting Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to order his arrest. 
“Police have taken action on a viral video on social media wherein a guard is seen torturing a woman,” said East-SSP Syed Abdul Rahim Sherazi.
He said that the guard, identified as Daud, was arrested in Noman Grand City, an apartment complex in Gulistan-i-Jauhar.
An FIR (745/2002) was lodged against him under Sections 337 (Shajjah), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of victim Sana Akram, he added.
The complainant stated in the FIR that she worked as domestic help at a flat in the apartment complex. 
On the night of Aug 5, she said, her son, Sohail, had come at the reception of the complex to give her food but Abdul Nasir, Adil Khan, Mehmood Khalil and others of the flat union did not allow him to go to the flat. Upon which, she came downstairs and asked as to why they were not allowing her son. This enraged Adil, who started using swear words against her and then asked security guard Daud to beat her. The guard slapped her and then kicked her when she fell.
“I am five to six months pregnant...I felt pain and became unconscious,” she stated in the FIR.
The video of the incident went viral on social media and CM Shah took notice of it and directed the city police chief to arrest the person who dared attacking an innocent woman.

3,MQM-P asks PM to ensure fairness in delimitation,Wonders as to why and how PPP-led govt carried out delimitation when it is actually ECP's job.,"KARACHI: Expressing concern over the delimitation process carried out by the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan on Monday asked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to play his role for justified delimitation of constituencies in urban parts of Sindh.
It wondered as to why and how the PPP-led government carried out delimitation in Sindh when it was actually the job of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
These concerns were expressed by the coordination committee of the MQM-P, which met here at its temporary headquarters in Bahadurabad.
“It’s high time that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif should play his role for the justified process mainly in urban Sindh and other parts of the province,” said an MQM-P statement. “On the directives of the Supreme Court, it’s the job of the ECP to carry out delimitation but it was the Sindh government of PPP which undertook this exercise.”
The meeting, it said, also expressed concern on the delay in implementation of the terms of the “Charter of Rights” signed between the MQM-P and PPP and MQM-P and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in March 2022.

4,"Urban flooding alert issued for Karachi, other Sindh cities",Met office says heaviest rain spell expected on Thursday; fishermen advised to take extra care till Aug 13.,"KARACHI: The Met office released on Monday an urban flooding alert for Karachi and other cities as monsoon currents penetrating in Sindh are likely to become more intense from Tuesday (today) onwards.
Speaking to Dawn, chief meteorologist Dr Sardar Sarfaraz explained that the prevailing weather system was expected to turn intense gradually, first taking over southeast parts of Sindh on Tuesday afternoon or in the evening and then northeast areas including Karachi late at night with scattered heavy falls.
He said the heaviest spell is expected from Aug 11 onwards when the low pressure area building up in eastern India would enter Pakistan and gain strength from the conditions prevailing over the Arabian Sea.
“Then, it is likely to affect the whole of Sindh. But, before that, there would be scattered moderate to heavy falls on and off in several parts of the province,” he said, adding that the prevailing weather system had blocked sea breeze, causing warm, humid conditions in Karachi.

Met office says heaviest rain spell expected on Thursday; fishermen advised to take extra care till 13th

Sea conditions are likely to become rough/very rough during August 10-13 and fishermen are advised to take extra care, the Met department alert stated.

5,Study highlights severe inequities in water access in Karachi,94pc samples tested in city's Lyari area were found contaminated.,"KARACHI: Lyari’s water problem, and those of similar settlements across Karachi, cannot be resolved by only augmenting water supply as often stated in public discourse and water utility plans. Rather, institutional structures and policies are needed to ensure equitable access to existing water supply system, says a study recently published in an international journal.
It demonstrates how poor performance of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) has led to severe inequities in water access in Lyari, forcing the poorest to spend the most for the least volume of water and compromise on the quality of life in pursuit of water.
Titled Beyond water scarcity: Water (in) security and social justice in Karachi, the research is published in the Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies.  
It is authored by Dr Hassaan F. Khan, Assistant Professor of environmental sciences at Habib University (HU) and Director of the Karachi Water Project, and Syed Ali Arshad, a Habib alumnus, while the field work was done by university’s undergraduate researchers.

94pc samples tested in Lyari found contaminated

The study quantifies how limited access to the water network contributes to household water insecurity beyond just a “shortage” of water which tends to hijack almost all discourse on water in Karachi.
In the first phase, 465 household surveys across Lyari’s 11 union councils were conducted and analysed, followed by interviews and participant observations.
According to the study, only about 28 per cent of dwellings in Karachi (where nearly half the population lives in informal settlements) have reliable access to municipal piped water.
Public discourse, it says, understands Karachi’s burgeoning water crisis through reasons like dwindling reserves and a growing demand-supply. This dominant narrative of water scarcity has swayed attention away from how poorer populations have to involve in alliances/conflicts for access to water on a daily basis.
“Weak urban water governance in Lyari contributes in pushing vulnerable sections of the population further to the margins. The intermittent piped water supply in Lyari is inadequate, unsafe, unreliable and inconvenient,” it said, and added: “This forces many households to resort to additional costlier and inconvenient sources of water and leads to severe inequities in water access. Lower-income populations are especially affected and pay disproportionately higher amounts for a much lower water consumption.”
According to the study, Lyari with an approximate population of 660,000, grew as a largely informal settlement, which was regularised only after the 1970s, where the new government provided 90-year leases to households, and allowed Lyari to be considered in the city’s water infrastructure plans.
The water quality tests for bacterial contamination from 79 selected households in sample population reinforce these findings: an alarming 92.4pc of households’ drinking water tested positive for presence of Total Coliform; 77.2pc of these households drinking water samples showed presence of E-coli, which is a primary cause for several waterborne diseases.
Despite this, a sustained culture of lax governance by state institutions allowed the region to become a “gray zone of state power” categorised by rule of criminal syndicates, practices of political patronage, and a dramatic growth of illegal high-rise apartments. 
“Consequently, amenities like water supply were influenced by these actors and developments, causing marginalisation and displacement of certain communities: whilst the groups with better social/political capital were able to settle in areas with better water access, the poorest communities, such as the native Sindhi Mahigeer community and the rural-urban migrant Zikri community continued living in regions in the southwestern wing with poor access to piped water,” the study says.
For all surveyed households with piped water connection, the median for total water supply per week is only 3.5hours.
“Several hours spent daily in collection and transportation of limited quantities of water can cause bodily and emotional distress, especially among women compromise personal hygiene, and prevent pursuit of opportunities that can result in improved outcomes, such as economic activities and education,” the study says.
As many as 95pc of all the households that have to travel for water, complained about physical exhaustion caused by activities, including carrying large quantities of water in hand, on back or over their heads on a daily basis, as well as having to stand in lines, especially during scorching weathers during summer season. 
Finally, when residents are unable to access enough water through either piped supply or other free sources, they have to resort to using the readily available, albeit considerably more expensive sources like tanker service, Mushki, and other vendors.
For lower-income households, buying this water involves major cuts on other household expenses, especially during summer when prices increased significantly owing to increased consumption.
The study points out that KWSB is not able to generate sufficient revenue for any improved services. Survey results show that as many as 80pc of all households with pipeline connections, two-thirds of whom get regular supply of water, do not receive a water bill. 
In situations where households have maintained “illegal connections” or live in non-leased houses, officials claim that the KWSB is unable to send water bills.
However, even for households that do maintain a lease and have been provided authorised water pipeline connections, the majority continue to utilise water supply without receiving any bill. According to the water utility’s executive engineer for the region, such households have not “registered themselves with the service”. 
“In other words, in order to get billed, the onus is actually on the consumers themselves to visit KWSB’s revenue offices and document their connection to the system,” the study says.

6,The car workshop owner and Niaz-i-Husain at Lucky Star,"KARACHI: Every year as Muharram begins and Ashura approaches, the people of Karachi remember hundreds of the...","KARACHI: Every year as Muharram begins and Ashura approaches, the people of Karachi remember hundreds of the cauldrons of haleem that would be lined up for distribution of Niaz-i-Husain along Dr Daudpota Road, better known as the Lucky Star area. 
The haleem would be cooked and distributed for free among devotees and passers-by under the supervision of the owner of a vehicle’s axle and suspension repair workshop, Shah Jee Axle Walay. 
Several years have passed and you don’t see Shah Jee, a tall, well-built figure with a big bushy moustache and dark brown sunglasses, there anymore. Off and on there have been nostalgic mentions of the Ashura day dish on social media. There has been lots of speculation, too, about what happened to Shah Jee. 
Some say that he passed on while his sons took their shares in the business to go their separate ways. Some say that the business empire of Shah Jee is not what it used to be and thus he can no longer afford to organise the mass niaz. Still, no one really knows for sure what happened to Shah Jee. 
Dawn set out to get the real story. The place to begin our search was right there under our very noses where it all used to happen — Lucky Star.
At the biggest adjoining Shah Jee Axle Walay workshops in Saddar, we run into another tall gentleman with bushy moustache and shoulder-length hair supervising the work. He resembles the picture of Shah Jee on the shop’s banner. It turns out that he is Nazim Shah, his son. 
The first question we have for Nazim Shah is about Shah Jee’s whereabouts while bracing ourselves to be informed about the worst. But to our relief, we are informed that Shah Jee is still very much around though in Islamabad. “He had a paralysis attack some years ago which has left him not as active as he used to be,” the son informs. 
“My sister is married to the son of my uncle [Shah Jee’s elder brother]. They live in Islamabad. After my elder uncle’s passing, my sister and her husband were insisting that our father come to live with them because they were lonely. Then after he suffered a stroke, he also decided to move to Islamabad. In his eighties now, he is getting old also, and his health is not what it used to be anyway,” he says. 
Another partner in the vehicle repair workshop business, Riazuddin, recalls that the last big Muharram niaz organised by Shah Jee comprised 400 cauldrons of haleem for which they had sacrificed some 60 bulls and cows. 
“He wouldn’t even sit down for a breather,” he smiles. “Seeing his enthusiasm and goodwill, despite being Sunni, some cattle breeders sold their huge Australian cows worth Rs2,500,000 each to Shah Jee for Rs700,000 each. It was for a good cause.” 
The partner also explains that Shah Jee’s popularity and his famous workshop earned them plenty of enemies, too. “So many workshops sprang up all over the city claiming to be our branches. We had to go into litigation to shut them down. Now there are only three big genuine Shah Jee workshops — one here, one in Gulshan-i-Iqbal Block 7 near Disco Bakery and one at Safoora Chowrangi on University Road — run by his sons Nazim Shah, Azam Shah and Tahir Shah. The litigation process also moved away our attention from philanthropy,” he says. 
“Besides being a huge philanthropist and social worker, Shah Jee also had political leaning with the PML-N. In his prime, back in 1997, he had even brought a lion to this place. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, too, visited Lucky Star twice. Shah Jee also used to organise football matches, martial arts demonstrations, kick-boxing and bodybuilding competitions here. He had set up several sports clubs, too. Besides, he would organise a 14th-August rally that began from Lucky Star; he would set up relief camps during natural calamities and celebrate Eid Miladun Nabi in a big way here. But after his health started deteriorating some 20 years ago, things slowed down,” he shares. 
Shah Jee’s sons and business partners still do organise the famous Niaz-i-Husain at Lucky Star but, obviously, it is not done on as big a scale as their father used to do.

7,Appellants told to file rejoinder in plea against Karachi's Malir Expressway,The tribunal has adjourned the proceedings till Aug 17.,"KARACHI: The Sindh Environmental Tribunal has asked the counsel for the residents and environmentalists to make rebuttal to the reply filed by a private firm constructing the controversial Malir Expressway project.
The tribunal, headed by retired Justice Nisar Ahmed Shaikh, asked advocates Kazim Hussain Mahesar and Muhammad Imran Kalmati to file the rebuttal on the next date and adjourned the hearing on appeals challenging the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) approval of the project.
The tribunal has adjourned the proceedings till Aug 17.
The location of the project, as per the EIA approval, is starting from right before the Jam Sadiq bridge on Korangi Road and run along the right bank of the Malir river through the Korangi and Malir districts, terminating on M-9 near DHA City outside Karachi.
On a previous hearing, Advocate Ravi Pinjani, who represented M/s Malir Expressway Limited, had filed a copy of the ‘fresh’ EIA report dated June 10 and signed by Sepa director general Muhammad Naeem Mughal, removing the appellants’ objection that the earlier EIA report was signed by a deputy director who got no legal authority to issue such an approval under the law.
Regarding the merits of the appeals, the counsel had argued that the appellants never raised any environmental concerns with regard to the environment of the metropolis.
He had objected that since the tribunal’s domain was environmental concerns therefore the appeals should be dismissed for lacking merit since the appellants did not highlight any environmental adversity in the proposed project.
The lawyer also challenged the appellants` locus standi, arguing that they were not directly aggrieved by the proposed project, while they did not highlight any adversity by the proposed cutting of trees or air pollution, etc, in their appeals.
He maintained that with the construction of the Malir Expressway “we will have primary advantage that western portion of the metropolis is connected through bypasses, but there is no such bypasses connectivity in the eastern corridor. Therefore, this project will connect the city with far-flung parts, including Korangi Industrial Area, the Defence Housing Authority and other areas on the outskirts”.
Advocate Pinjani argued that at present the average daily commuting time in the eastern corridor was 90 minutes, adding that with the construction of Malir Expressway this commuting time would be reduced to 30 minutes on an average day. “The overall impact is positive for the metropolis, since this is not any commercial or residential project, but a highway,” he claimed.
The company’s lawyer had also maintained that around 1,800 trees coming in the way of the expressway were to be cut down, but Sepa had advised to grow 19,000 trees with three rows of trees cover on either side of the expressway to maintain environmental balance in the area.
Lastly, the counsel had submitted that the project currently costing Rs27 billion, out of which 72 per cent is publically funded since its a consortium of banks and the Sindh government.
Opposing the appellants’ requests for granting an interim stay order against any construction activity at the site, Advocate Pinjani had cautioned that if due to any technical reasons the project was stayed the costs would spiral up given the growing rate of inflation. 
He pleaded to dismiss the appeals for being devoid of merits.

They have kept the distinction intact for decades.
The community is concentrated in Hazara Colony in Hussainabad, which witnesses multiple activities during Muharram ranging from serving of ‘langar’ (free food) to staging of old mourning processions. 
Mallah and Solangi communities were the oldest ones living in the area followed by those whose elders migrated from India and Hazaras. Several houses of their community are located in Hazara Colony mainly close to the protective bund.
Hazaras, usually, pass a low profile life even though they are serving in government departments. However, when it comes to Ashura, the Hazara men including young and elderly lead the central Ashura’s procession on 10th of Muharram here. They would keep the tradition intact even tis day, they resolved.
Hazara Imambargah is located a few paces from the protective bund. Members of the community profess Asna Ashari sect among Fiqah-i-Jafria and have been living in the area for close to seven decades. Because of distinct facial features this ethnic community is easily distinguishable.
Ashura (today’s) central procession emanates from Qadamgah Maula Ali off Station Road. Hazaras’ dasta (circle) remains in the forefront of a procession staged under the aegis of Anjuman-i-Hyderi (AH), registered in 1948. 
“Our dasta is the first among all Anjumans without any fear while other Anjumans get their numbers after balloting,” says a bearded Hamid Hussain, administrator of Hussainabad’s Hazara Imambargah. 
“We never felt frightened or threatened even when Hazara community members were being massacred in various parts of the country, particularly in Balochistan. We had led Ashura’s procession even in those days without having any fear,” said a confident looking Hamid Hazara.
Hyder Ali, his young fellow who works in a private school, is incumbent general secretary of the community’s Anjuman after the death of his father. 
The 7th Muharram mehndi of Shahzada Qasim was one of the important events of the community in Hussainabad. It is held inside an Imambargah. “Like any other event of Shahzada Qasim’s mehndi, women from other ethnic backgrounds turn up in our Imambargah to have their ‘mannat’ for different reasons including social, domestic, personal and family oriented,” informs Hamid.
District police provide security to mourners who are part of central procession. Besides other mourners, Hazaras were taken to Qadamgah under security for leading the central mourning procession. They beat their chests and flagellate en route to Karbala Dadan Shah from where they were brought to their Imambargah under security.
“Many of our elders had settled here in Hyderabad and Nawabshah soon after partition. Gen Musa also owned land in Bulri Shah Karim, Tando Mohammad Khan district,” Hamid Hazara recalled. Some community fellows also live in Latifabad Unit-3 and in 60-Mile area in Shaheed Banazirabad district.
“Our members are associated with government jobs and also own shops in Qadamgah area and deal in used clothes business in loonda bazaar,” he says. They are active in different political parties, chiefly Pakistan Peoples Party. “Sindh Assembly member Jabbar Khan considers our colony as his strong vote bank,” Hamid says.
Their Muharram observance of rituals was largely confined to their locality and mainly at the Imambargah. Ritual of our 7th Muharram mehndi is also performed within the Imambargah,” interjects an elderly Nadir Ali Hazara in Persian while speaking to Hamid. 
He also agreed with Hamid that his community fellows here never scared away from terror incidents targeting their community members. Many including children had lost their lives in the terror waves of religious extremism, sweeping the country.
Hazara community stages Imam Hussain chehlum’s procession in Hussainabad instead of participating in the central procession of the city which was brought out by Anjuman-i-Imamia Sindh (AIS). After taking a round of the street the mourners again converge on the Imambargah, and Hamid explains why.
“Our community’s ‘dasta’ used to be at the forefront at number one in chehlum procession as well like Ashura’s. But then Anjuman-i-Imamia Sindh (AIS) changed our number to which our community members objected and parted company with them,” says Hamid. AIS stages chehlum’s or “Arba’een” central procession in the city. It emanates from Qadam Gah and culminates at Dadan Shah.
AH general secretary Syed Raza Rizvi points out that Hazaras participate as one community or tribe under the command of their elder. “We always want that procession is led by those who are organised more than anyone else. And that’s why we keep our own Anjuman at the tail of the procession to make sure that the procession reaches its destination on time,” he says.
Hazaras, he says, don’t participate in any balloting for getting number of ‘dasta’ as they are somewhat exempted from this process. But other Anjumans have to participate in the process. So, he says, that’s why Hazaras lead AH’s central procession every year.

11,Emergency assistance ordered after death of 17 ailing children in Sindh's Dadu district,DHOs asked to set up medical camps in wake of deaths caused by gastroenteritis.,"DADU: Sindh chief secretary has directed district health officers of Dadu and Jamshoro to establish medical camps in flood-hit areas of Kachho and Manchhar Lake to provide help to ailing children on an emergency basis in the wake of reports of 17 children’s death from gastroenteritis. 
The chief secretary Dr Sohail Ahmed Rajput took serious notice of the children’s deaths, which started coming out of the rain-hit areas from July 7 to date during and after heavy rains, and asked Dadu DHO Dr Ahmed Ali Samejo and Jamshoro DHO Dr Vinod Kumar to bring aid to the ailing children at their doorsteps.
He directed the health officers to diagnose real cause of the children’s deaths. He would not brook any negligence by health officials in this regard and take stern action against them if the camps were not set up immediately, he warned.
He said that directives had also been issued to secretary of health, DG health Sindh, Hyderabad commissioner and Dadu deputy commissioner to monitor the operation of the medical camps and government healthcare facilities in Kachho and Manchhar Lake areas.

DHOs asked to set up medical camps

Dadu DC Syed Murtaza Ali Shah said that he had written letters to DHO Dr Ahmed Ali Samejo on Aug 2 and 5 and asked him to organise the camps and report about deaths of children and others from gastroenteritis and other diseases.
Palijo’s appeal
Ayaz Latif Palijo, president of Qaumi Awami Party, has demanded Sindh and federal governments immediately provide medical facilities, ration and other essential needs of life to rain-hit people of Kachho.

Palijo said the government had not yet taken serious efforts to provide food and medical facilities to people of Kachho and ensure measures to protect human lives.

They would always be in the forefront to spill their blood for Sindh if things ever came to such a pass, he said. 
It were the Afghan nationals who wreaked havoc on Sindh’s soil and Syed Jalal Shah, Dr Qadir Magsi, Ayaz Latif Palijo, Sanan Khan Qureshi, Riaz Ahmed Chandio and other leaders and old nationalist families fully appreciated this fact, they would never incite people to hatred for all Pathans in Sindh, remarked Durrani.
Talking to media persons after offering condolences to Amanullah Pathan over his mother’s death in Jacobabad, Durrani said that current monsoon rain had ruined standing crops and inundated cities and villages in Balochistan and Sindh.
He said in answer to a question on bills that it was Sindh government’s duty to enforce laws made by Sindh Assembly but implementation of federal government’s laws could be problematic in the province when the centre did not support or cooperate in their enforcement.
Commenting on foreign funding case against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, he said that it was an old case and the Election Commission of Pakistan should have impartially and thoroughly checked the evidence of the case.

With these few vehicles, the Larkana Municipal Corporation (LMC) could perform its duty of firefighting in an efficient manner, it said, pointing out that the city had expanded in all directions and its population had also increased to 800,000 souls. 
The LCCI has urged the authorities concerned to establish more fire stations at different locations.
LCCI president Bashir M. Paryal Shaikh has written a letter to the department concerned in this regard.
Speaking to Dawn on Monday, he said it looked unjustified that the city with a population of 800,000 people had only one fire station. He said that the station was located in the thickly populated area, Jiles Bazaar, which appeared to be hub of business and trade. Vehicular traffic in the area could hardly move in peak hours, often at a snail’s pace. In an emergency situation, the fire brigade vehicles struggle hard to move amid a mess of traffic. This causes delay in rushing to a place where fire has to be extinguished. Ultimately the fire inflicts more damage. He said the four firefighting vehicles available to the station were procured in 1990s and since then the LMC seemed to have paid no attention to their maintenance. 
The station was in a shabby condition and very recently the plaster of its ceiling had partially fallen down, he said, adding that the life its personnel were also at risk while sitting in the office and the parking area. 
“It is very sad to see that the district is left at the mercy of nature; an emergency can hit this city anytime and the fire brigade would not be able to cope up it, he apprehended. 
He suggested that at least four fire stations be established on the outskirts of the city and also new vehicles be made available to them to save people from suffering heavy losses in the event of emergencies.

16,Khuhro condemns social media campaign over chopper crash,‘Imran Khan cannot escape disqualification after ECP’s foreign funding case decision’,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Sindh president Senator Nisar Ahmed Khuhro on Monday visited Sujawal Tunio village near Bakrani town to offer his condolences to the family of Maj Saeed Ahmed Tunio, the pilot of the army helicopter that had crashed in Winder, Balochistan, on August 1. Six army officers had embraced martyrdom in the incident.  
Other PPP leaders including Abdul Fatah Bhutto, Shakeel Memon and Amin Shaikh were accompanying Mr Khuhro. 
Later, speaking to the media the Senator condemned the regretful campaign on social media in the wake of the chopper crash. He fully supported the calls for immediate legal action against all those involved in the propaganda against the state and its institutions. He regretted that the propaganda was resorted to while the entire nation was in deep distress over the tragedy. He acknowledged that the institution of army had always been on the forefront and played its due role in difficult times. 
Mr Khuhro also commented on former prime minister Imran Khan’s politics and criticised him for “instigating youth to adopt a wrong path”. This would give birth to disturbance, he apprehended, and advised Mr Khan to “stop poisoning youths’ minds and exploiting them for his personal gains”.  

‘Imran Khan cannot escape disqualification after ECP’s foreign funding case decision’

The PPP leader claimed that fissures had emerged within PTI over its leadership. “There are many candidates in PTI for the slot of prime minister and one of them is [former foreign minister] Shah Mehmood Qureshi,” he further claimed.  
A day earlier, the PPP leader held a press conference here to explain his party’s views with regard to the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision against PTI in foreign funding case. Mr Khuhro said Imran Khan was facing disqualification after the ECP decision and now seeking “NRO from political leadership of the ruling coalition [at the centre]. 
“Imran Khan is sending messages to the political leadership and seeking to spare himself from action,” alleged Mr Khuhro. 
“How could he be granted NRO now when foreign funding against him has been proved?” he argued, and expressed his confidence that Mr Khan would not escape disqualification. 
When leaders like Khwaja Nazimuddin, Ayoub Khuhro, Qazi Fazlullah, Pir Illahi Bakhsh, Hussain Shaheed Suharwardi and others could be disqualified than why not Imran Khan, he further argued. 
The PPP Senator noted that some PTI lawmakers were tendering their resignations while some others were sending their leave applications.  
Mr Khuhro alleged that millions of rupees had been deposited in the accounts of President Dr Arif Alvi, former Sindh governor Imran Ismail and other PTI leaders. President Alvi should step down and face the investigation, he said. 
He also pointed out that President Alvi and Imran Khan gave contradictory statements about alleged “directions” leading to the successful no-trust move against PTI government. “It proves that Mr Khan’s claim of US conspiracy was a lie,” he added.

On Aug 8, 1972 Kassim Haji Abbas Patel, Provincial Minister for Industries and Mineral Development said that those who were raising the slogan of ‘Sindhu Desh’ and demanding Karachi as a separate province were the enemies of the country. The people who were living in Sindh — Mohajirs, Punjabis, Pakhtuns, Sindhis and Balochis — were all Sindhis. He appealed to them that “all of us should live like brothers as Sindh is our hearth and home.” 
In a similar vein, on Aug 11, a joint meeting of MNAs and MPAs from Karachi representing various political parties reviewed the operational activities carried out in the province to maintain law and order in the region. The meeting, held at Qasr-i-Naz, was convened by Central Education and Provincial Coordination Minister Abdul Hafeez Pirzada. He told journalists that the meeting noted with satisfaction that the people of Karachi had displayed the highest sense of responsibility as was expected from them and that there had been no provocative speeches. He felt it was a healthy sign.
And on the eve of Independence Day, the first administrator of Karachi when it used to be the federal capital, Syed Hashim Raza called upon the people in general and the youth of the country in particular to rededicate themselves for building Pakistan into a progressive and modern nation. 
He was speaking at an event organised by the Pakistan-Iran Cultural Association at a local hotel. He said Pakistan was the Quaid-i-Azam’s ‘amanat’ which should be defended with our blood. Referring to the tragic happenings in East Pakistan and its secession, Mr Raza asked them to create conditions for a united and collective fight against the enemies of the country so that the remaining part of Pakistan could be safeguarded. 
Something noteworthy happened in the realm of the media, too, which was relaying all these reports of attempts made to lift the spirits of the countrymen. On Aug 9, the Karachi Union of Journalist (KUJ) decided to establish a ‘struggle fund’. It directed all the unit chiefs of the union to collect Rs5 per month from every member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) in addition to their monthly subscription. The KUJ also directed them to step up their campaign in their respective units for the restoration of the legitimate rights of newsmen and other workers of the press industry.
Weather conditions often play a part in setting Karachi’s socio-cultural and political moods. Tides are usually high in the summer, especially in the months of July and August. On Aug 13, unfortunately, Klaus Saler, a German national and a senior executive of a hotel in the city, drowned in Hawkes Bay. He had joined the hotel a few months ago and was living alone. Thought to be a good swimmer, he had gone to the sea with a picnic party. After getting swept away by the strong currents, he was rescued by fellow swimmers and rushed to the nearest hospital in Mauripur, but did not survive.

In reply to a question about former prime minister Imran Khan’s demand for early general elections, he said the country could not be run on any individual’s demand or wish. He argued that the incumbent dispensation at the centre was constitutionally elected by the parliament. “The federal government is an elected dispensation and not a selected one,” he insisted.  
He said only the masses had the powers to decide about general elections. If they wanted early elections, then their call must be accepted. In the other case, he added, the incumbent federal government would complete its constitutional term.  
He remarked that the federal government was trying to manage the mess left by the previous government.

Mr Shah, who visited Karoonjhar Hills on Sunday, was speaking to the media about his plans to promote tourism in the desert region. 
“We have already established a beautiful tourist attraction, Rooplo Kolhi Resort, here whereas more such projects are in the pipeline to develop the area as a unique tourist site. These project would help promote seasonal tourism in Tharparkar,” he said, and added that board and lodging facilities for families in other rest houses here would also be made available. 
Mr Shah said that a 30-room comprehensive English-medium school with all essential facilities and science equipment would be established for local boys and girls in Nagarparkar. Besides, he said, a centre for archaeological research and another resort with modern facilities were being established this town. 
Regarding illegal extraction of granite from Karoonjhar hills, the minister said that he was trying his best to check the illegal activity that was damaging the hills. “The PPP leadership believed in protecting all such sites and encouraging healthy activities so that people could get maximum benefits from them and Sindh’s culture could be promoted in a very effective manner,” he said. 
He pointed out that a museum and certain other structures were built and named after eminent freedom fighter Roolpo Kolhi and Thari philanthropist Miskeen Jahan Khan Khoso. 
Mr Shah said that the higher authorities would again approach the command of the border security forces on a plan to install a chairlift at Karoonjhar. 
He said he was delighted by seeing a large number of tourists thronging Nagar­parkar and other parts of the Thar region to enjoy natural beauty amid heavy rains over the last few weeks that had turned this desert region lush green.
Speaking about the acute water shortage experienced by Sindh in the first half of the year, Syed Sardar Shah said that the provincial government had undertaken certain mega projects of small dams to store rainwater which brought about an agricultural revolution in this region. “More projects to promote culture and heritage were being undertaken with a view to ensure people’s easy access to historical sites, especially the ancient Jain temples,” he said.
MPA Qasim Siraj Soomro told the media that the ongoing rainfall had already turned the entire desert region lush green and thousands of people were visiting it these days to enjoy natural beauty.

24,"All agricultural taxes, loans in rain-hit areas be waived: SAB",‘Initial estimate of losses to crops may be close to Rs50bn’...,"HYDERABAD: The Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) has urged the Sindh government to waive off all taxes and agricultural loans, recoverable from farmers, in the rain-hit areas of Sindh.
The call was made at a meeting of SAB office-bearers held here on Sunday under the chairmanship of Mahmood Nawaz Shah to discuss various issues, mainly impact of rains on crops, livestock and the plight of growers, farmers and tillers in the affected areas.
It said that heavy rains had hit all districts of the province and caused huge losses to growers. The date-growing areas had also suffered losses as around 150,000 out of 220,000 tonnes of the produce was badly affected.
The mature fruit on trees had been destroyed as well, it added.
The meeting noted that cotton growers had first suffered due to water shortage from March to June and then heavy rains affected the crop in many districts in July. These districts included Mirpurkhas and Sanghar where the crop was completely destroyed or heavily damaged.

‘Initial estimate of losses to crops may be close to Rs50bn’

In addition to it, over 70pc onion crop was destroyed in Tando Allahyar, Matiari, Mirpurkhas and other districts. Other crops such as chilies and cauliflower were severely affected, it said. 
The SAB leaders said that initial estimates would put the overall losses close to Rs50bn and they could go even higher if incessant rains continued.
With doubling of the production cost and fertiliser being unavailable at company-declared rates, the agricultural economy remained under stress, they noted, and apprehended that the situation could have an adverse impact on the national economy as well in coming months. 
The board emphasised the need for short- and medium-term measures to rehabilitate the agricultural economy.
It proposed provision of interest-free loans to farmers in the areas where crops were destroyed. These areas could be identified through the technology that is indigenously available. 
The SAB meeting demanded that all taxes and levies as well as agricultural loans be waived off in the rain-hit areas.
It said that subsidised fertilizer availability should be ensured during Rabi season.
It regretted that the Kisan Card was being worked on for two years but could not be distributed as yet. 
It said that disaster management bodies should be made more proactive and they should liaison with growers’ organisations with a view to devise strategies and respond more effectively.
The SAB leaders said that rehabilitation of natural waterways like Dhoro Puran, Dhoro Naro and others should be ensured to drain out excessive water. 
The Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) should be rehabilitated or remodeled so that it could work perfectly. The Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD) was lying incomplete for over 18 years which should also be completed at the earliest, they said.
The meeting said that crop Insurance schemes at least for small- and medium-sized growers should be ensured. 
It also demanded establishment of a ‘climate emergencies fund’ keeping in view that such emergencies had become more frequent.
The meeting was attended by Syed Nadeem Shah, Azam Rind, Aslam Marri, Imran Bozdar, Arbab Ahsan, Mustafa Nawaz Shah, Taha Abbasi, Mehtab Loond and others.

He took notice of reports about illegal appointment of BPS-19 to 21 as teaching faculty published in local dailies and voices raised against blatant violation of the recruitment policy of the university and ordered secretary of universities and boards to launch a thorough inquiry into the charges levelled in this regard by Dr Mohammad Aslam Korai, a college lecturer who had applied for the post of assistant professor in organic chemistry department.
Mr Korai said that appointment of teaching faculty especially ‘assistant professor’ in four branches of the department was not made according to the requirement policy as laid down in the advertisement published in March for the post of BPS-19.
The advertisement said the candidates who applied for the post of assistant professor must have a PhD degree with two years teaching and research experience at a recognised university or professional experience in the relevant field in a national or international organisation but the candidates who were cleared for selection did not meet the criteria, said the complainant.
He said the university administration conducted interviews on July 2-4 but neither any notification was circulated nor any candidates applying for the post of assistant professor were called for interview.
Furthermore, as per Higher Education Commission, members of the selection committee should have PhD degree holders in relevant field but they were not experts in the relevant fields and lacked exposure to chemistry branch, yet they conducted interviews and recommended short list of ‘favourites’ for appointment as assistant professors in the chemistry departments.
At the time of papers’ scrutiny, eligibility criteria were completely neglected and only favourite candidates’ papers were approved, he claimed.
Three other candidates Atta Hussain Rind, Khalid Hussain Bhutto and Aijaz Hussain Memon were declared eligible though they did not meet the criteria for the post, he said, adding that Jamshed, brother of director of the Institute of Islamic Studies, was also declared eligible.
He accused media coordinator of the Faculty of Social Sciences dean Prof Dr Taj Mohammad Lashari of getting two of his daughters appointed as lecturers at zoology and education departments with the support of the university registrar.
The complainant proved his charges leveled against selection committee and managing board with the help of ample evidence.
Two college lecturers, who had also applied for the post of assistant professor in zoology department, said that they were not even called for the interviews.
Asked whether they would submit complaints against the selection board, one of them said he was currently doing PhD at the university and could not even think of going against the management while the other said it was wastage of time to talk against corrupt mafia in the syndicate and the selection committee.
A source at the university said that apart from unfair selection of ‘favorites’ through sham interviews, the practice of large-scale embezzlement and misappropriation of funds was rife at the university.
He said that no efforts were made to improve standard of education at the university and create bright opportunities for students. The syndicate members and powerful individuals were interested only in exerting influence and using unfair means to have their sons and daughters selected for the teaching faculty posts in several different departments at the university, he said.
Asked what would happen if the complainants decided to move the court, he said that the policies formed by the syndicate could not be challenged in any court. 
The university’s spokespersons and information cell were unavailable for comments.

27,"Without alternative, ban on plastic bags in Sindh bound to backfire",Industry source says 10bn shoppers used in Karachi annually and it is not known what other product would replace them.,"KARACHI: In the absence of an alternative, the city administration with the support of provincial authorities and law enforcement agencies is set to undertake a gigantic task by fully enforcing an eight-year-old ban on all plastic bags in Karachi after Ashura, it emerged on Sunday. 
The authorities believe that widespread use of plastic bags — a more than a billion pieces of such products are used each year in the country — after becoming an environmental hazard has now started taking a heavy toll on the city’s infrastructure, sewerage system and municipal services. 
Last week the Sindh government had announced initiating a stringent action against manufacture, sale and use of all plastic bags across the province. 
As the government is ready to initiate the action, the question arises about the effectiveness of the new move as the ban was already in place since 2014 hardly affecting the production, sale and use of the plastic bags. 

Industry source says 10bn shoppers used in Karachi annually and it is not known what other product would replace them

“It is true that the ban has been there since 2014,” said Karachi Administrator and Sindh government spokesman Barrister Murtaza Wahab. 
“But the problem is that the city or district administration cannot enforce that curb with certain resources. This time the move is different because we have taken everyone onboard, including the provincial government, the police and other relevant authorities. So after Ashura, we hope that a notification will be issued that will lead to enforcement of the ban,” he said. 
However, a question remains about the outcome of the fresh move which would deprive Karachiites of plastic bag which has become an essential daily use item. 
Intrinsic to city lifestyle 
The widespread use of plastic bags, mainly in urban setting, is also supporting certain industries to grow. 
“The industry estimates and even government institutions suggest that 55 billion shopping [plastic] bags are used annually in Pakistan,” said an industry source citing the data compiled by the Pakistan Plastic Manufacturers Association (PPMA). 
“Being the largest city in terms of area and population, Karachi tops among others where 9-10 billion plastic bags are used every year. This is a huge number. I am not sure what other product would replace them in such a large quantity. These are not just bags, they have become our lifestyle,” he added. 
Despite that argument, which mostly relies on huge numbers of plastic bags production and widespread use in the society, experts discourage the use of plastic and suggest more technological and innovative ways to gradually come out of this “environmental hazard” in a more productive way. 
Recycling of plastic 
Dr Saud Hashmi, who’s the chairman of the department of polymer and petrochemical at the NED University of Engineering Technology, has recently launched an initiative at the varsity campus to make it plastic free. 
“We have initiated this project in collaboration with a multinational [fast-moving consumer goods],” he said. “The objective is to set an example through an innovative way on the basis of technology to convert or recycle them.”
He said: “The same recycling process at least allows us to melt this polythene material into household commodities. So I believe before banning anything completely, make its use a little difficult or expensive. So the people may switch to healthier trends to avoid financial burden.” 
He was in agreement with the thought that using only thicker plastic bags, weighing a minimum of 60 microns, would continue to add to the problem which the city was currently facing. 
He suggested that the only environment-friendly, workable and cheap replacement of plastic bag was the use of cloth shopping bag. 
From the platform of his university, Dr Hashmi also cited various initiatives and research projects which were going on that helped convert the plastic product into useful items. 
Plastic chocking drains 
The city administration on the other hand sounds more determined against the use of plastic bags after the relief efforts following the recent rains led to the fact that the drainage system of Karachi was mostly choked due to thousands of tonnes of plastic bags found in nullahs. 
“One can’t imagine how challenging it has become to restore our drainage system,” said Karachi administrator Wahab. “Despite spending huge money, deploying enhanced workforce and using every available machine, these bags fail every effort.”
“So it’s no more about thicker or some modified kind of plastic bag. We are going for a complete ban on this product. This is in the interest of everyone,” he said.

31,Parties condemn KE over agonising power outages in Karachi,"PTI, Muttahida, PSP and JI voice concern over utility’s indifferent attitude towards Karachiites.","KARACHI: Severe loadshedding being carried out by the K-Electric for the past more than one week despite low demand due to prevailing cool and cloudy weather in the metropolis forced key political parties to condemn the power utility’s “inhuman business strategy” and questioned its performance.
The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, one of the important partners in the coalition government at the Centre, expressed serious concerns over the KE for keeping its vested interests at the cost of other people.
“It seems the KE has only put its business interests supreme regardless of people’s sufferings,” said the MQM-P in a recent statement.
“Karachi was known for its lights and life andit is fast descending into darkness and disaster. The hours-long loadshedding in the city has made people’s lives miserable, and put them under severe mental and physical stress,” it added.

PTI, Muttahida, PSP and JI voice concern over utility’s indifferent attitude towards Karachiites

The party demanded that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif take notice of the excessive loadshedding and rein in the KE. 
Also on Sunday, senior MQM-P leader Wasim Akhtar warned that his party would free to set its future course of action if coalition parties — Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan Peoples Party — would not fulfil the written agreements that signed with the MQM-P.
Speaking at a press conference, he said that his party would never support those who ridicule the country’s judiciary and armed forces.
PTI slams federal govt, KE
The opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, which got the largest electoral mandate from Karachi in the 2018 general elections, said that a “blame game” was being played between the government and the utility company with a tacit understanding.
PTI’s parliamentary party leader in the Sindh Assembly Khurram Sher Zaman said in a statement that the federal government blamed the K-Electric and the company counter-blamed Islamabad for power shortages, loadshedding, losses, etc.
“Both are deliberately making people fool as in reality they protect each others’ interests. The government on one hand claims that it has not received dues from KE for the past one year. Then why did it not cancel the licence of the company? It won’t...because they both are operating in connivance with each others.”
He said that Finance Minister Miftah Ismail did not hold a single meeting with KE over the issue of prolonged loadshedding, while “Karachiites are forced to live in hell for the last one week”.
JI demands forensic audit
City chief of Jamaat-i-Islami Hafiz Naeemur Rehman called his party’s struggle against the KE and said that it had turned into a massive public movement amid its fast deteriorating performance and recent stories of corruption by its former head Arif Naqvi of Abraaj Group.
He demanded that the government order a forensic audit of the financial accounts of the power utility.
“You would find every single political party condemning the KE under public pressure,” he said and added: “But you won’t find a single leader questioning Arif Naqvi and his Abraaj Group because all political parties and their leaders are beneficiaries of his dirty game in Pakistan.”
“I wonder how the ruling parties are celebrating the verdict of the Election Commission of Pakistan against a certain party, but they aren’t ready to move against the biggest mafia founded by Arif Naqvi. But enough is enough. The people of Karachi have now learnt to raise their voice under the leadership of the Jamaat-i-Islami,” he said.
He condemned the KE for increasing loadshedding in the metropolis.
PSP demands more licences 
The Pak Sarzameen Party also condemned the KE for carrying out unannounced and “announced” loadshedding in the metropolis.
PSP chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal said that the monopoly of the KE over generating and distributing electricity in Karachi must be ended.
He demanded that the government give more licences to power companies to end the monopoly of the KE.

32,A dying tradition kept alive by children,Sabeels are set up with the advent of Muharram.,"KARACHI: The eyes of young occupants of a small tent in Saddar lit up all at once on seeing this scribe approach them. The tent is a sabeel (or refreshment stall) offering water and cool summer beverages for free in pretty colourful plastic glasses to passers-by.  
While little Shahzeb Ali, Abdul Wahid, Mohammed Zeeshan and Hamza Ali look on, Haji Ahsan Ali, the eldest among the boys, nags for monetary donations after offering cool beverages.  
“Oh come on,” he argues when met with the shaking of the head. “How do you expect us to run this sabeel without your valuable donation?” 
Shahzeb Ali and Abdul Wahid are also looking up hopefully at the prospect of getting some much-needed donations.  

Sabeels are set up with the advent of Muharram

“We get a variety of excuses whenever we ask for donations,” says Shahzeb. “Some say that they will surely give us some money after they get their salary, some say they don’t have small change on them,” he adds. 
“Others tell us that they will pay a visit to their bank before giving us some money. Yet others make an excuse of going to the nearest ATM. But we don’t get to see them again,” says Abdul Wahid.
Mohammed Zeeshan and Hamza Ali inform that they are all cousins. Before them, their older brothers or other cousins were responsible for the same stall being set up here by their maternal uncle.
“Our uncle pays for the basic tent and decorations, along with the plastic glasses. We set up the stall on the first of Muharram and start offering cool glasses of water from the second of Muharram,” says Zeeshan.  
“From Muharram 8, we will offer cool sherbet, too, which we will be doing throughout Ashura,” says Hamza Ali.
The uncle, Syed Sultan Shah Naqvi, then approaches the stall. “I set up a sabeel here, at this very spot, every year. Earlier, it was my other nephews who helped me decorate it and run it. Now when they are busy elsewhere, I have their younger brothers. The children are here every day in this heat offering cool water to passers-by. In return, if they ask for donations, please don’t frown at them,” the uncle smiles.  
“My older nephews will also be seen in action on Ashura day when they will be supervising the cooking of 20 cauldrons of haleem and as many cauldrons of biryani,”the uncle announces with pride. “And the money for all that food, to be distributed for free, will also come from the money collected by the young ones,” he adds.
The sabeel in Saddar was one of the first ones to be set up in Muharram. Though sabeels are a dying tradition now, some can still be seen in neighbourhoods like Liaquatabad, Malir, PECHS, etc. They are all usually set up by children who go around asking their elders and neighbours for donations. If they happen to live in a densely populated area, or in apartment buildings, all the better, as then they can collect more funds from more donors without doing much legwork.  
Many times, it has also been seen that the children, despite being annoying and a nuisance, are also helped in kind. For instance, someone’s Baji would freeze ice cubes for them, another Apa would wash their water coolers before refilling them with different kinds of sherbet or squashes or grind dried fruits to be added to the milk.
There is also no specific community involved in all this work. The kids hail from Sunni homes as well as Shia homes. Some are not even Muslim as Christian, Sikh and Hindu children are also invited by the Muslim children to come and join them. The more the merrier. And more kids also mean more volunteers to ask for more donations.

33,Urdu marsia has great potential to guide human thoughts,KARACHI: Marsia is the most powerful and significant genre of Urdu poetry that still owns a great potential to guide...,"KARACHI: Marsia is the most powerful and significant genre of Urdu poetry that still owns a great potential to guide human thoughts because it glorifies the battle of Karbala as a metaphor of disobedience to injustice, tyranny and oppression. 
Technically, marsia means a poem of grief over a great tragedy or lamentation for a departed soul. But now this genre is used precisely to commemorate the martyrdom of Ahle Bayt, especially the sacrifices of Imam Husain and his companions in the battle of Karbala. 
After getting the great technical and poetic strength from the two geniuses of Urdu poetry, Mir Babbar Ali Anis (1803-1874) and Mirza Salamat Ali Dabeer (1803-1875), the classical marsia started a new journey in the 20th century when the British Empire was striving to make its illegal regime stronger in the subcontinent by suppressing people in their own land.
It was the time when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which is also called the massacre of Amritsar, took place in 1919. The Indian freedom movement was at its peak and some enlightened poets and intellectuals like Molvi Muhammad Hussain Azad, Altaf Hussain Hali, Shibli Nomani, Ismail Merathi, Akbar Allahabadi, Molana Zafar Ali Khan, Allama Iqbal, Chakbast Lucknowi, Hasrat Mohani and many others were writing to make people aware against the designs of the colonial power and its conspiracies. 
During that time, the famous revolutionary poet Josh Malihabadi started writing marsia with a new poetic elegance, radical spirit, and grandiloquence. 
The second marsia of Josh Malihabadi entitled ‘Husain and Inqalab’, helped him get fame as the poet of revolution in the subcontinent. After the preamble of revolutionary style in Urdu marsia, the Urdu literature witnessed an emergence of strong metaphors inspired by the battle of Karbala. The battle of Karbala became the treasure of metaphors while the writers and poets belonging to the Indian Progressive Movement largely used such metaphors in their writings. 
In this connection, Molana Muhammad Ali Johar’s two poetic lines represent the great meaning of Karbala: 
Qatl-i- Husain asl mein marge Yazid hai 
Islam zinda hota hai har Karbala k baad 
Answering a query about the prominence of marsia in Urdu poetry, famous poet and intellectual Prof Saher Ansari told Dawn that literature was all about language. 
Marsia owned a vital place in Urdu literature as it had all prime linguistic characteristics, he said, adding that without marsia, Urdu poetry might be deprived of the highest values of ethics.
By the characters of Karbala, marsia communicated the great values of life to humanity, he said, and added that Josh Malihabadi transformed the genre by adding up revolutionary sentiments and values, which showed the vigorous spirit of marsia to guide human thoughts. 
Prominent scholar and writer Dr Muhammad Raza Kazmi highlighted the importance of the message of Karbala, saying that the message of Karbala was universal because sacrifice was a universal value. 
He said: “Edward Gibbon did not name Hur, but he wrote ‘A chieftain from the opposing side crossed over to claim the partnership of inevitable death’.” 
Not only Hur, but Umar bin Khalid and Yazid bin Ziyad crossed over from the safety of the army of Yazid to the side of Husain where there were pitifully few; where there was hunger; where there was thirst and certain death, Dr Kazmi said.
Simon Oakley has mentioned the scene when Qays bin Ashath asked Husain why he did not bow to the will of his cousins. Husain replied in front of the whole army: “I will not give my hand in his hand in humiliation neither shall I flee like a slave.” 
Dr Hilal Naqvi, a famous critic and marsia writer, said that marsia was an inevitable part of Urdu literature as it had provided the great treasure of words to the Urdu dictionary.
He pointed out: “Marsia, whether it is new or classical, is the only kind of Urdu poetry that voices against the malice, brutality and imperialism.” 
Quoting Anis as saying: 
Lanat khuda ki mazhab-i-Ibn-i-Ziad per, Dr Naqvi said that poetic line had great meaning condemning the oppressors and tyrants of all time. 
Marsia drew the attention of people towards the voice of Imam Husain against the satanic powers of the time, he observed. 
Eminent scholar, intellectual and poet Firasat Rizvi said that the previous century had witnessed the flood of revolutionary movements, fatalities of the first and second world wars, colonialism, and darkness of fascisms, deprivation, and global depression. During that time marsia was describing the sacrifices of Imam Husain and his companions to encourage the people of the subcontinent to live their life with full energy. 
He pointed out that the first marsia of Josh Malihabadi entitled, ‘Awaza-i- Haq’ had pointed toward the emergence of political awareness in the genre of Urdu marsia. Talking about the spirit of marsia, he said: “Marsia teaches people to raise voice against tyrants, support disadvantaged people, condemn Yazidi ideas and encourages to opt for the path of Husainiyat.”

Infant boy beaten to death
An infant boy was beaten to death allegedly by his young father in Surjani Town on Sunday, police and rescue services said.
