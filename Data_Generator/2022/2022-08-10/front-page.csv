FAISALABAD: Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah talks to reporters on Monday.—Dawn

 
• Sana says those found guilty in funding, online hate campaign probes to be arrested
• PTI warned against violence in drive for snap polls
• Khattak says establishment not upset with PTI
LAHORE: The ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is confident Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan is going to be disqualified in the Toshakhana reference as he has not declared in his assets the amount he received from the sale of state gifts.
“Imran Khan is certain to be disqualified in the Toshakhana reference as he did not declare in his assets the millions of rupees he rece­ived from the sale of state gifts. This is a two-plus-two case. He has done an illegal and immoral act and will be disqualified,” Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah said while talking to journalists in Faisalabad on Monday.
Citing the case of his party supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, the minister said: “A standard has been set by disqualifying Nawaz Sharif for not receiving salary from his son’s company. If he can be disqualified over it then Imran Khan is certain to face the same fate for not declaring millions of rupees in his assets that he got after selling the Toshakhana gifts,” he stressed.
Last week, the PML-N-led coalition government filed a reference with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) seeking disqualification of ousted premier Khan from holding public office for allegedly acquiring gifts from the Toshakhana state repository.
The reference demanded the ECP disqualify Imran under sections 2 and 3 of Article 63 of the Constitu­tion, read with Article 62(1)(f). Article 62(1)(f) is the same provision under which former prime minister Nawaz was disqualified in 2017.
A group of MNAs associated with the ruling Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) had filed another reference with the ECP seeking Mr Khan’s disqualification from holding public office for receiving prohibited funds from a number of foreign donors.
On the other hand, PTI senior leader and former minister Pervaiz Khattak said the so-called plans to oust Imran Khan from politics would not succeed. “Only the public can oust Khan from politics and no one else,” he said and declared there was nothing “concrete” against the PTI chairman in the prohibited funding and Toshakhana cases.
Interior Minister Sanaullah further said when a watch gifted to Imran by the ruler of a country was taken to a Dubai market the latter was contacted and asked whether it was stolen. “This was not only an illegal and immoral act, but it also affected Pakistan’s relations with that country,” he claimed.
Arrests in funding, chopper probes
Mr Sanaullah further asserted that the government would make arrests in the Federal Investigation Agency probes into the PTI’s prohibited funding and the malicious social media campaign against the army helicopter crash.
“The government has formed two committees of the FIA -- one probing into the social media smear campaign in the wake of the army’s chopper crash in Lasbela, and the other into PTI’s prohibited funds. Those found guilty in the investigations will be arrested,” Sana announced.
Former federal minister Fawad Chaudhry reminded Sanaullah to go after those (Shehbaz Sharif and Hamza Shehbaz) who were alleged to have laundered billions of rupees instead of forming several committees to probe into Rs20 million charges.
“The coalition government made Hamza Shehbaz, a Rs24 billion money laundering accused, flee to London, but formed five FIA teams to investigate Rs20m charges (against the PTI). Do Shehbaz and company consider the public fool? After Muharram, accountability of the suspects of May 25 will begin and the nation should start preparations for the final round of struggle for real independence,” Chaudhry announced.
PTI warned against violence
The interior minister warned that stricter action than that of May 25 (during the PTI’s long march on Islamabad) would be taken against Imran Khan and the PTI if they resorted to violence in the name of protests to press the government to call early polls.
“The PTI is allowed to hold peaceful protests as it is the constitutional right of the people, but if it resorts to violence or blackmail, the government will take stronger action than that of May 25,” he said, while referring to the PTI’s one-month ultimatum to the government for fresh elections.
Sana’s warning comes a day after former premier Khan said he would announce a strategy to “counter the fascism” of the coalition parties and not budge from his stance of fresh polls being the only solution to steer the country out of the economic crisis.
Sana also taunted Khan for pressing the government to announce a date for elections and at the same time demanding removal of the chief election commissioner (CEC). “You (Imran) should first remove the CEC before demanding fresh elections. You should stick to one stance. Also, you should dissolve the assemblies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab and then ask us for dissolution of the National Assembly,” he commented.
He also blamed Imran Khan for the hateful online campaign against martyrs of the army helicopter crash. He said Afghanistan had not yet blamed Pakistan for a drone attack on its soil in connection with the killing of Al Qaeda leader Zawahiri, but Imran was doing so.
‘Military not angry with PTI’
Meanwhile, former defence minister Pervaiz Khattak of the PTI claimed on Monday that he had been in touch with the military establishment and there was no animosity between the PTI and the army.
Talking to reporters in KP, Mr Khattak claimed: “I am in contact with the army and it is not angry with the PTI.”
He further said the government should first dissolve the Sindh and Balochistan assemblies after which the PTI would follow suit in Punjab and KP. He also asked Nawaz Sharif to return to Pakistan and face Imran Khan one-on-one.

1,"Army unwilling to allow rally at Islamabad's Parade Ground, alleges PTI","Reached conclusion that permission was conditional to 111 Brigade's nod that is not willing to allow rally, says PTI's Ali Awan.","ISLAMABAD: After failing to get permission for its public meeting scheduled for the eve of Independence Day despite proposing three venues in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has decided to shift the event to Lahore.
“We have been told that the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) has already applied for its public meeting at Parade Ground on Aug 13. However, we have reached the conclusion that the permission was conditional to the nod of the 111 Brigade that is not willing to allow us. Otherwise, we would have been allowed one of our proposed venues,” PTI Islamabad president Ali Awan said while talking to Dawn.
On Aug 6, the PTI’s political committee had announced plans to hold a power show in the federal capital on Aug 13, the eve of Independence Day. The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by PTI chairman Imran Khan and attended by its senior leadership, including Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry, Shireen Mazari, Omar Ayub, Saifullah Niazi and others. Mr Khan had also stated that he would announce his party’s future strategy during the event, and that is why directions were issued to party leaders to ensure an “impressive” show of power.
Mr Awan said the PTI had sought permission from the district administration to hold its public meeting at the Parade Ground, but it was informed that the TLP had already applied for the venue.

Aug 13 power show moved to Lahore

“Then we requested [the administration] to shift the public meeting to Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, but the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) objected to it and we were told that their curators were working there as a security team is expected to visit before the English team’s visit to the country,” he maintained.
“Then we started considering holding the public meeting at Liaquat Bagh, but were told that recently, plantation has been undertaken at the park and there will be very little space for the public meeting,” he added.
The PTI leader further said he reached the conclusion that it was not possible to get permission in the twin cities, as the nod of the army’s 111 Brigade was also required.
“Although we have been told that confirmation has not been given to the TLP yet, it is strange that the TLP can hold a public meeting at the Parade Ground, but not the PTI. So now we have decided to hold the public meeting at Hockey Ground, Lahore,” he announced.
He further said that former premier Imran Khan will address the Lahore gathering, which will be telecast across the country.
“The party chairman will announce a future strategy and we will hold a fireworks display and a flag-hoisting ceremony at midnight,” Mr Awan said.

The closing ceremony was held at the Alexander Stadium with performances from artists including Apache Indian, Beverley Knight, Dexys Midnight Runners, Goldie, Jacob Banks, Jaykae and Jorja Smith.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Games had been a “shining example” of the power of sport in “strengthening the ties between our unique partnership of Commonwealth nations”.
He praised Birmingham for being “fantastic first-time hosts” and “cementing the UK’s well-deserved reputation for hosting major sporting events on the global stage”.
He also thanked the volunteers, the crowds and the athletes for making the Games “the best yet”.
Johnson added that the success of Birmingham 2022 “will be measured not only in medals won or records broken but also by the number of people inspired to take up sport as a result and who will be able to, thanks to this government’s massive investment in grassroots sport in recent years”.”
The closing ceremony also included a formal handover to Australia’s state of Victoria, which is hosting the 2026 Commonwealth Games.

3,SC says police personnel must be upright,Observation made by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on appeal against Punjab Services Tribunal's rejection of plea to reinstate ASI.,"ISLAMABAD: The Sup­reme Court has held that police personnel should be upright and have an unimpea­chable cha­r­acter, as well as clean antecedents, since the job demands accountability at every step and places a tremendous responsibility on them.
The observation came in a judgement authored by Jus­tice Muhammad Ali Maz­har on an appeal against a decision by the Punjab Services Tribunal which rejected a plea by an assistant sub-inspector of police on Sept 22, 2020.
The Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar.
Faraz Naveed was appo­inted as assistant sub-inspe­ctor through the Punjab Public Service Commission.
He was charged with murdering Tufail Haider Naqvi at a police station in Gujrat in Nov 2014 after keeping him in illegal confinement.
He was indicted under Section 302 PPC and the Anti-Terrorist Act (ATA), read with Article 155-C of the Police Order, 2002.
On Nov 5, 2014, the petitioner along with other police officials Thereafter, the petitioner murdered him with a hatchet in a room within the premises of the police station.
An anti-terrorist court (ATC) awarded Faraz Naveed the death sentence under Section 302 PPC and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorist Act. He was also sentenced to three years in jail under Article 16 (d) of the Police Order 2002. The ASI then took his appeal to the Punjab Services Tribunal (PST), but it found the petitioner guilty and recommended departmental action against him.
Faraz Naveed was later dismissed from service.
He challenged his conviction in the Lahore High Court, which acquitted the petitioner by giving him the benefit of doubt.
While he was in jail, he was served a show cause notice on Nov 8, 2014, and dismissed from service on Jan 10, 2015, after departmental inquiry.
But after he was acquitted, the petitioner filed a departmental appeal, but it was rejected. He then filed an appeal with the Punjab Service Tribunal, but it too dismissed the plea on Sept 22, 2020.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar of the Supreme Court observed in the judgement that despite acquittal, it was the prerogative of Faraz Naveed’s employer, the Punjab Police, to reinstate or disregard his request for reinstatement.
It is for the department to examine equitably whether the petitioner has been completely exonerated or not and to satisfy itself that his reinduction would not become a threat to discipline in the police force.
A person having criminal antecedents would not be fit to be reinstated to his previous position, the judgement observed.
It further said the apex court did not find any illegality or perversity in the dismissal order. Therefore, the present petition is refused, the verdict explained.
The benefit of doubt, as of right, should be given to an accused when there is an equal possibility of the accused being guilty or not guilty, the Supreme Court said.
Two interpretations
The benefit of doubt, according to the judgement, can be extended to an accused only if the facts and circumstances of the prosecution case were susceptible and amenable to two interpretations, one in favour of the prosecution and the other in support of the accused,
But an employer, while considering the issue of reinstatement as aftermath of acquittal of an already dismissed employee, will have the unbridled right and authority to dwell on and appraise the antecedent and fitness of the employee, the judgement said.
In the absence of any provision in the service rules for reinstatement, if an employee is honourably acquitted by a court, no right is conferred on the employee to claim any benefit, including that of reinstatement.
The reason is that the standard of proof required for holding a person guilty by a criminal court and the inquiry conducted by way of disciplinary proceeding is entirely different.
The rationale of initiating disciplinary proceedings by the employer is to see whether the charges of misconduct levelled against the delinquent are proved or not and in case his guilt is proved, what action should be taken against him, the judgement explained.
It is a settled exposition of law that the prosecution, in criminal cases as well as in a departmental inquiry on the same allegation, can be conducted and continued concurrently at both venues without having any overriding or overlapping effect.
The object of a criminal trial is to award punishment of the offences committed by the accused while the departmental inquiry is initiated to investigate allegations of misconduct, the judgement said.
In the departmental inquiry, the standard of proof is that of “balance of probabilities or preponderance of evidence”, but not “proof beyond reasonable doubt” – a strict proof required in a criminal trial because the potential penalties are severe, the verdict explained.

4,"Commanders of Peshawar, Bahawalpur reshuffled","With his latest posting, it appears Gen Faiz has been taken off from the overall Afghan and TTP-related matters.","ISLAMABAD: Three lieutenant generals were transferred and posted on Monday, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) announced.
Corps Commander Peshawar Lt Gen Faiz Hameed was appointed Bahawalpur corps commander, replacing Lt Gen Khalid Zia, who has been appointed the military secretary GHQ. Military Secretary Lt Gen Sardar Hassan Azhar Hayat has been appointed as the Peshawar corps commander.
Gen Faiz Hameed’s transfer is a bit surprising as he had served less than a year as Peshawar corps commander. Earlier, he had served as the director general of Inter-Services Intelligence, where he unnecessarily got embroiled in a controversy over the then prime minister Imran Khan’s refusal to post him out from ISI.
Gen Hameed had remained involved in striking a deal with the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, as well as in Afghan affairs, both as head of the ISI and as Peshawar corps commander.
With his latest posting, it appears he has been taken off from the overall Afghan and TTP-related matters.

5,Khorasani among three TTP men killed in Afghan blast,Hardline ‘commander’ was part of Taliban team holding talks with govt,"

Omar Khalid Khorasani

 
NORTH WAZIRISTAN: The Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­is­tan lost one of its most hardliner ‘commanders’, Abdul Wali alias Omar Khalid Khorasani, in a bomb blast in the Afghan province of Paktika, the proscribed group and security sources across the border in Afghanistan confirmed on Monday.
Two other ‘commanders’ of the outfit were killed in the bomb attack that occu­rred in Saraki village of Birmal tehsil of Afghanis­tan, near the Pakistan border, on Sunday.
While confirming the incident, TTP spokesman Mohammed Khorasani said Omar Khalid Khorasani, Mufti Hassan and Hafiz Dawlat were killed in the bombing.
According to TTP sources, an improvised explosive device (IED) hit the vehicle carrying Khorasani and the other ‘commanders’. Funeral prayers were held in Afghanistan on Monday. Khorasani’s death occur­red at a time when the outfit has been enga­ged in extensive peace talks with the government of Pakistan in the Afghan capital, in order to end the two decades long militancy in the region.

Hardline ‘commander’ was part of Taliban team holding talks with govt

The Taliban interim government has been facilitating talks between the two sides. Islamabad has sent several delegations, comprising religious scholars and tribal elders, to convince the TTP leadership to give up armed struggle.
Khorasani, who belonged to Mohmand tribal district, was also a member of TTP’s powerful Guidance Council. Sources said he was part of the TTP delegation that is holding peace talks with the Pakistani government. Khorasani has seen as more extreme than the hardliners within the TTP.
The talks between the two sides remained inconclusive so far.
“He (Khorasani) had taken a hawkish position in peace talks in Kabul and the TTP leadership was made aware of this fact,” said one source. TTP has lost several of its key commanders, including its chief Maulvi Fazlullah, in mysterious blasts or drone attacks in Afghanistan.
Khorasani became member of TTP in 2004-05. He claimed responsibility for various attacks on security forces, schools and suicide bombings in Mohmand district in which scores of people were killed and wounded.
Initially, he was head of Tehreek-i-Taliban Mohmand (TTM). Later, the group joined TTP. In 2014, he formed his own group Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA) and was ousted by the Mullah Fazlullah-led group. The same year JuA swore allegiance to the militant Islamic State group. However, a year later he rejoined TTP.
It may be mentioned that Khorasani was one of the founding members of TTP. He had strong links to Al Qaeda and Ayman al Zawahiri.
Sources said Hafiz Daulat, who belonged to Orakzai tribal district, had also affiliation with IS’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter while Hassan hailed from Malakand Division.
Pakistani officials said Omar Khalid Khorasani’s death could deal a blow to nascent peace talks with TTP, according to Reuters.
JuA was designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations and United States, which had offered $3 million for information leading to Khorasani’s capture or death.

6,Probe team on online drive now a JIT with intel officials,"Six-member team comprises four FIA officers, one each from ISI and IB; PTI’s Asad Umar warns against targeting party.","• Six-member team comprises four FIA officers, one each from ISI and IB
• PTI’s Asad Umar warns against targeting party
ISLAMABAD / KARACHI: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) team — formed to trace and arrest those running a negative social media campaign on the tragic army helicopter crash in Balochistan — has been reconstituted and converted into a joint investigation team (JIT) with representation from the premier intelligence bodies, besides the four FIA officials announced on Sunday.
According to a notification issued by the Interior Ministry on Monday, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the six-member JIT includes Lt Col Saad from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and Intelli­gence Bureau (IB) Deputy Director Waqar Nisar Chaudhry.
The four FIA members on the team were Additional Director General (Cybercrime Wing) Muhammad Jaffar, Director (Cybercrime, North) Waqar­uddin Syed, Islamabad Addi­tional Director (Cybercrime Wing) Ayaz Khan and Assistant Director Imran Haider.
The JIT has been tasked with identifying and taking legal action against those involved in running a negative social media campaign on the helicopter crash. After the accident, some social media activists and political zealots launched the deplorable hate campaign online to advance their personal and political malice, which drew a strong reaction from the general public, political leadership and the state institutions.
While the FIA is said to have started putting in place a monitoring system to gather all relevant data, the PTI has warned that any attempts to malign the party under the cover of this malicious campaign would elicit a strong response.
The agency has apparently mobilised all its cybercrime centres in its north zone and deployed its experts, who in the first phase had started acquiring relevant data from social media platforms.
“The teams are using all necessary tools and software for result-oriented efforts,” said an FIA source. “There are known social media platforms, which were used for this negative campaign, and are being monitored. Even the negative posts that were later deleted after public outcry are being retrieved to get an idea of the origin of this content and the people behind their generation.”
PTI vows to prove lies
On the other hand, the PTI vowed that if it was attacked in the name of the FIA probe, it had all the due “capability, skills and human resources” of social media to prove the lies and bring forth the truth.
“We have all the skills and resources to carry out the forensic analysis of any social media campaign,” PTI Secretary General Asad Umar told Dawn. “It’s ridiculous to blame and target the PTI for this campaign. We have a very strong social media team, which has always worked for awareness and respect of the institutions. We have the capability to determine and trace who’s behind all this negative campaign.”
The former minister welcomed the move to penalise those who were running the negative campaign against the institutions, but demanded that any move should be in line with the defined rules and not intended for political vendetta.
He then referred to a youth, who was identified as one of those behind the smear campaign against the army and had later apologised in a video statement for the “objectionable” posts on his accounts.
“That particular boy didn’t have many followers nor was a known person,” he said. “But to make a case, his unnoticed tweets were used by some influencers and media professionals with hundreds of thousands of followers. This proves that it’s more to settle scores than showing respect for any institution.”
The PTI’s response comes in the wake of the ruling coalition in the Centre blaming the social media team of the party for launching the hate campaign at the behest of PTI Chairman Imran Khan. The PTI leadership was also accused of not attending the funeral of Lt Gen Sarfaraz Ali and other martyrs of the chopper crash. However, they attempted to negate the impression, as President Arif Alvi telephoned the families of the martyrs, while Mr Khan visited the residence of Lt Gen Ali.
President Alvi also came under sharp criticism for not attending the martyrs’ funeral being the supreme commander of the armed forces.
Some social media users had alleged the helicopter crash was ‘orchestrated through a conspiracy by the establishment’, however the Pakistan Army spokesperson condemned the negative online propaganda.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general had on Friday condemned the “highly unacceptable and regretful social media campaign” after the unfortunate incident. “The online campaign caused deep anguish and distress among the families of martyrs and rank and file of the armed forces,” the ISPR in a statement.
“While the whole nation stood with the institution in this difficult time, certain insensitive quarters resorted to hurtful & derogatory comments on social media,” it said.

7,FIA team to trace culprits behind online campaign over Balochistan copter crash,"PM Shehbaz terms social media campaign ""ridiculing the sacrifices"" of martyrs ""horrifying"", calls for ""deep reflection"".","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Sunday sprang into action and constituted a team to trace and arrest those running a negative social media campaign on the tragic incident of army helicopter crash amid flood relief operation in Balochistan, after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said belittling and ridiculing the sacrifices of martyrs was horrifying.
“The social media campaign belittling & ridiculing the sacrifices of our martyrs was horrifying. This is what self-righteous political narratives do: they poison the minds of the youth & weaponise hate speech. 
“Which way are we headed? The moment calls for a deep reflection,” PM Sharif wrote on his Twitter handle. 

 





 
Also, the head of ruling coalition partner Chaudhry Shujaat came up with an appeal to politicians to put aside their political affairs and expediencies and foil the propaganda campaign against the armed forces, a day after a joint resolution was adopted by the Balochistan Assembly “saluting the brave senior officers of Pak-Army who sacrificed their lives to protect the lives of flood-stricken people of Lasbela”.

PM calls for reflection amid ‘horrific’ drive against martyrs

Earlier, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), condemning the “highly unacceptable and regretful social media campaign”, stated it “caused deep anguish and distress among the families of martyrs and rank and file of the armed forces”. 
On Sunday, the FIA constituted a four-member team and tasked it with pointing out, arresting and taking legal action against those involved in running a negative social media campaign on the tragic incident of helicopter crash.  
The FIA team, to be headed by additional director general of cyber crime wing Mohammad Jaffar, will include director (cyber crime, north) Waqaruddin Saeed and additional director Imran Haider as its members, according to Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb.
After the chopper crash, a section of social media activists and certain political zealots launched an abhorrent and unacceptable online campaign to advance their personal and political malice, which drew a strong reaction from the people belonging to all walks of life, political leadership and the state institutions.
The ruling coalition at the Centre has been blaming the social media team of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf for launching the smear campaign on the behest of PTI chairman Imran Khan. The PTI leadership was also accused of not attending the funeral of Lt-Gen Sarfaraz Ali and other martyrs. However, the PTI leadership attempted to negate the impression as President Arif Alvi phoned the families of the martyrs while Mr Khan visited the residence of martyr, Lt-Gen Ali.
Meanwhile, the Balochistan Assembly in a joint condolence resolution moved by treasury and opposition members and adopted a day ago paid tribute to the six army officers who embraced martyrdom in helicopter crash in the Winder area of Lasbela district while supervising rescue and relief operations in the flood-stricken areas.
The joint resolution stated, “We salute these brave senior officers of Pak-Army who sacrificed their lives to protect the lives of flood stricken people of Lasbela.” It said their sacrifice would always be remembered as they did not bother about their lives while performing their duty and the entire nation was in shock on their shahadat. 
“Whenever we need the help of the people, our brave army personnel and officers rush to provide help and comfort to the needy people,” the resolution said and expressed deepest grief and pain over the tragic incident that deprived the nation of the senior army officers.
The resolution was moved by Adviser to the Chief Minister on Home and Tribal Affairs Mir Ziaullah Langove on behalf of Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo, Mohammad Khan Lehri, Mir Nasibullah Marri, Mohammad Khan Toor, Mobin Khilji, Nawabzada Gohram Bugti and Maulana Noorullah. 
Provincial ministers Noor Mohammad Dummar and Syed Ehsan Shah, opposition leader Sikander Khan, Abdul Khaliq Hazara, lawmakers Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi, Khalil George Bhutto and other members paid tribute to the martyrs.
They recalled that Lt-Gen Ali, as IG Frontier Corps (South) and XII Corps Commander, played an important role in maintaining law and order in the province and guided the youths of Balochistan towards the right direction. His role in the progress and development of Balochistan was unforgettable, as he personally visited far-flung areas of the province to get himself aware about the issues being faced by the people, they added.
While strongly condemning the negative propaganda from some political circles and quarters, they said they were “agents of the enemies” of Pakistan. “If we have such elements, who are making baseless and negative propaganda, we do not need foreign enemies,” they pointed out.
They said the entire nation condemned this propaganda and standing with the families of martyrs.
Appeal to foil campaign
Meanwhile, PML-Q president and ex-premier Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain on Sunday urged politicians to fully support the armed forces, putting aside their political affairs and expediencies. “Politicians should keep [their] political issues and expediencies aside and foil the propaganda campaign against the armed forces fully supporting defenders of the country,” he said.
Everything could be tolerated except propaganda campaign against the armed forces, he said, adding that the whole nation shared the sorrow and grief of the families of the martyrs.
He said Pakistan Army helped and served the nation in every calamity, trouble and difficult times. “The armed forces have played an important role and laid down their lives in restoring peace and order and ending terrorism in the country and thus deserved respect and support.”

8,Notices by probe body to party leaders baffle PTI,• Party claims FIA issued notices to leaders who were not office-bearers at time of funding  • Minister says implementation of...,"• Party claims FIA issued notices to leaders who were not office-bearers at time of funding
• Minister says implementation of ECP ruling in progress
ISLAMABAD: As investigations into prohibited funds received by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) inch forward, PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry on Sunday questioned the issuance of notices to four PTI leaders, including former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser.
At a press conference, the former information minister said he could not comprehend why notices were issued to the party leaders even though they did not hold any office in 2011-12 when the party received these funds.
The Federal Investigation Age­ncy (FIA) has summoned former Sindh governor Imran Ismail and MPA Dr Seema Zia in Karachi; Mah­moodur Rasheed, Punjab’s local government minister, in Lahore; and Asad Qaiser in Peshawar.
“I do not understand in what capacity FIA is issuing notices to our leaders. These people were not public office-holders in 2011-12. However, we are cooperating with the FIA,” he added. 
Mr Chaudhry said PTI had provided details of its accounts to the Election Commission of Pakistan.
He said the party would approach the courts for the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) audit to be finalised within 15 days. He claimed that PML-N had received Rs10 million but had not declared the funds.
Accusing the PML-N of money laundering, he alleged that the party had spent Rs1.3 billion on media campaigns but had not mentioned any source.
He further claimed that ex-president and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Asif Ali Zardari headed one part of the party while Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari headed another. According to the PTI leader, the explanation given by the PPP leaders was that one party funded another; however, under the ECP rules, no political party could fund another party. He asked why the ECP was “protecting the PPP and the PML-N”.
Fawad also claimed that certain “journalists and Baloch insurgents” were harping on about PTI chief Imran Khan’s disqualification. 
“Who has the courage to disqualify Imran? You are not announcing elections because you fear he will win a two-thirds majority,” he said, adding that a campaign was underway against Imran Khan.
“The government is holding by-election on nine seats because it is fed up with its allies. They want to gather seats gradually to secure a majority. This is their political move,” he went to allege.
Probe into May 25 cases
During the press conference, the former minister said that PTI — which rules Punjab along with PML-Q — would also launch an investigation into the cases registered against its workers and leaders in the province following the long march on May 25. He said that investigation team could summon Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and Ataullah Tarar, who had served as home minister in Hamza Shehbaz’s cabinet before its dismissal as a result of a Supreme Court verdict, and expected that they will cooperate during the investigation just like the PTI has decided to cooperate with the FIA in the funding case.
It may be noted here that the PML-N government in Punjab had stopped the May 25 march of the PTI with iron hand and had taken into custody scores of PTI leaders in a late-night crackdown. The provincial government then led by Hamza Shehbaz had also registered cases against the PTI leaders.
ECP verdict
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb said implementation on the prohibited funding case ruling was in progress, reported APP. “The decision in the funding case has been given [by the ECP] which is being implemented as per law,” she said in a statement while reacting to Fawad Chaudhry’s comments on social media. She said the PTI had been declared a “foreign aided” party under the Political Parties Order 2002. Imran Khan had submitted a false affidavit with ECP five times as per the decision, she added.
The PTI sought 51 adjournments, changed nine lawyers, and filed 11 petitions in courts, the minister observed. “The lies, fraud and drama of a foreign agent and foreign aided party must end,” she added.

The PSO has already moved the competition appellate tribunal against the Competition Commission of Pakistan’s (CCP) direction to tender the existing fuel farm, Eastern Joint Hydrant Depot, at Karachi airport and notices had been issued to the CAA and other respondents on the matter, the country’s largest fuel supplier reminded the federal government.
In a communication to the petroleum secretary, PSO Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Syed Mohammad Taha said the company maintained jet fuel refuelling facilities at 10 airports across Pakistan as per international standards and had been investing millions of rupees every year to upgrade and maintain these facilities for increasing productivity and efficiency.
However, the state-owned supplier warned, “PSO be­ing a public sector entity cannot agree to operate at loss-making airports only, while we are being removed from a major airport on the pretext of promoting competition.”  
It recalled that when CAA had issued a tender for establishment of jet fuel refuelling facility at Skardu airport, PSO explained that flights for Skardu got two-way fuel from Islamabad airport and due to the high road transportation cost, fuel price at Skardu airport would be very high, discouraging airlines to refuel from Skardu. Yet in the national interest, PSO participated in the tender and agreed to establish a mobile facility for a temporary period to support the government vision to promote tourism, it explained.
The CEO also reminded the federal government that a few years back, a private troubled entity, Hascol Pet­ro­leum, had approached the CCP complaining that the CAA had not been allowing them to establish fuel farm at Karachi airport for jet fuel business. Subsequently, the CCP directed the CAA to tender the existing Fuel Farm i.e. Eastern Joint Hydrant Depot (EJHD), a joint venture of PSO, Shell Pakistan and Total Pakistan for past six decades.
PSO later challenged the CCP direction before the appellate tribunal, which is pending adjudication. 
Regardless of PSO’s continuous engagement with the CAA and explaining that fuel farm can be leased through “direct allotment” as per CAA Policy 2019, but the CAA in violation of its own policy issued a letter of interest (LOIs) for operation and management of EJHD, Karachi airport, according to the PSO. Strangely eno­ugh, it noted, the CAA also claimed the ownership of Hydrant Refuelling System, which was purchased by PSO and its partners in the joint venture through 1994 agreement of sales.
Three other airports 
The PSO chief pointed out that the CAA was also planning to offer loss-making Sukkur, Nawabshah and old Gwadar airports for takeover and establishment of jet fuel facilities under ‘direct contracting’, without considering the option of tender.  He complained that the CAA’s current approach was not public-sector friendly, as it was asking PSO to operate at all loss-making airports and “at the same time evicting PSO from Karachi airport which is to some extent a viable business option”.
PSO officials said the government had been approached to not only look into the matter but also ask the CAA to adopt a uniform policy for all airports whether it seeks to lease out jet fuel refuelling facilities at all airports through tender or through direct allotment to PSO. 
“It is unfair to expect PSO to feed smaller airports at a loss while major airports are offered for competition which should be on overall basis instead of pushing for selective competition,” an official said.
When the CAA was approached by Dawn for comment, the officials said they could not respond to questions before Wednesday (due to two-day public holiday for Ashura on August 8 and 9). 
SOS calls 
PSO has been raising SOS calls to avoid international default as delay in payments by different entities had exhausted its liquidity. As a result, the company has not been able to deposit Rs81bn to the federal government’s local currency account for onward transmission to Kuwait Petroleum Cooperation (KPC) under a contractual obligation. The government had to order special arrangements for payment of Rs32bn to meet the obligation.
Just last week, the federal government was informed that PSO’s receivables had touched Rs608 billion as of July 28, including Rs340bn from Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL). A major contributing factor was the LNG supply that added a cash shortfall of Rs213bn since July 1, 2021. SNGPL, on its part, had been constrained by delayed payments by Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) whose receivables jumped to Rs113bn from Rs43bn since January 1, 2022. CPPA had another Rs182bn direct payables to PSO on account of fuel supplies, including Rs16bn accumulated since July 1, 2022.
Moreover, PSO had not been able to deposit Rs16bn to the federal government against an integrated-term finance certificate (ITFC) facility, which has been deferred to avoid PSO’s international contractual obligations. There has been a decline of sales of high-speed diesel (HSD) and petrol for PSO by 28pc and 32pc respectively, having an impact of Rs69bn on collections, while about 17.8pc devaluation of rupee against dollar in July alone had resulted in increased cost of procurement of these products by PSO by Rs63bn. It was reported that PSO had foreign exchange loss of about Rs85bn over the years of which Rs28bn was settled in the last quarter of 2020 while Rs55bn was still outstanding.
Despite these challenges, the petroleum secretary had warned the ECC, PSO had met its contractual international payments in July 2022, but “this will not be possible in August”, resulting in disruption of the national oil and gas supply chain in LNG and petroleum products. While PSO’s collections during the first fortnight of August are expected at Rs157bn, it is supposed to make an international payment of Rs267bn in the same period, indicating a net deficit of Rs100bn.

10,FO rejects New Delhi’s ‘ludicrous comments’ on OIC stance,"In statement distributed at UN headquarters, OIC reiterated calls for implementing UNSC resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir.","ISLAMABAD: The Fore­ign Office on Sunday categorically rejected the ludicrous comments and fallacious claims made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) regarding a statement of the Organi­sation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). 
In a statement distributed in the UN headquarters on Friday, the OIC reiterated its earlier calls for implementing UNSC resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir, which recognise the right of the Kashmiri people to decide their own future. The OIC General Secretariat reminded India that its Aug 5, 2019, illegal action could not alter the disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir. 

 





 
The Foreign Office spokesperson said in a press release on Sunday that India’s hubris in this regard was deplorable. The spokesperson said the OIC is the largest multilateral forum of Muslim countries representing more than 1.7 billion Muslims and has always been vocal in support of the legitimate rights of the Kashmiri people, who had suffered unspeakably from India’s seven-decades-long illegal occupation and unabated oppression. 
While perpetuating its tyranny and injustice, the spokesperson said India would not succeed in misleading the international community by claiming socio-economic growth and development in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. 
“No amount of repetition would turn a falsehood into truth. In the interest of justice as well as durable peace and security in South Asia, India must honour its commitment to the Kashmiris and to the world community by faithfully implementing the UNSC resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” FO the spokesperson maintained.

11,Arshad Nadeem tears record books to win javelin gold at CWG,"Without his coach and with his elbow heavily taped due to injury, Arshad wins the final with a monster 90.18-metre throw.","BIRMINGHAM: The gold delivered in record-smashing style, a 56-year medal drought in track and field for Pakistan at the Commonwealth Games ended, Arshad Nadeem sank to his knees and prostrated. 
This meant a lot. This was incredible. Against all the odds, without his coach and with his throwing elbow heavily taped due to injury, Arshad won the javelin throw final at the Alexander Stadium with a monster 90.18-metre throw on Sunday evening. 
Achieving that distance in his fifth throw, he came on top in a field that included world champion Anderson Peters, former Olympic champion Keshorn Walcott and former Commonwealth and world champion Julius Yego. 

 





 
That brought Pakistan’s first athletics medal at the Games since 1966 and a first javelin gold for the country, bettering Mohammad Nawaz’s silver at the inaugural edition of the quadrennial multi-sport spectacle in 1954 and Jalal Khan’s second-placed finish in 1958.
It was Pakistan’s second gold in Birmingham and the first was also won with a Games record when Nooh Dasagir Butt triumphed in the +105kg weightlifting competition. 
Like Nooh, Arshad was also one of Pakistan’s leading hopes for a medal going into the Games and he delivered a statement of his intent with just his first throw. 
On an evening when he improved on his personal best thrice, Arshad’s first effort was 86.61 metres. 
He was setting the distance to beat for the rest of the field and it was a question of whether it would be enough for gold. 
A foul on his second attempt didn’t matter as Arshad imp­ro­ved his personal best again with a throw of exactly 88 metres. 
Each effort, however, ended with Arshad grimacing in pain, the 25-year-old immediately reaching out to feel his right elbow, which he’s been nursing after last year’s Tokyo Olympics where he finished fifth. He finished at the same place at last month’s world championships. But in the lead halfway through the final, he could still afford a smile. 
Arshad’s fourth throw landed just beyond the 85-metre mark but with two rounds remaining, he was still in the lead. 
It was in the penultimate round, when Arshad finally trailed — Peters launching the javelin to 88.64 metres. Peters celebrated as if it was enough for gold but his joy was short-lived. This was Arshad’s gold to win and he immediately threw over the sport’s ‘holy grail’ mark of 90m. Doing so he became only the second Asian to cross that mark after Taiwan’s Chao-Tsun Cheng (91.36m). He also broke the Games record of 88.75m by South African Marius Corbett that stood since 1998.  
Peters, who threw over 90 metres to win at the worlds in Oregon, tried with his final throw to overhaul Arshad but it wasn’t to be. He ended with silver with Kenya’s Yego picking up bronze with a best throw of 85.70m. 
10 Sri Lankans missing 
Meanwhile, 10 members of crisis-hit Sri Lanka’s Commonwealth Games contingent in Birmingham disappeared in a suspected attempt to remain in Britain, a top sports official said on Sunday. 
The nine athletes and a manager vanished after completing their events, the Sri Lankan official said, requesting anonymity. 
Three of them — judoka Chamila Dilani, her manager Asela de Silva, and wrestler Shanith Chathuranga — had disappeared last week. 
That prompted a police complaint by the Sri Lankan officials. 
“Since then, another seven have vanished,” the official said, without identifying them. 
“We suspect they want to remain in the UK, possibly to get employment.” 
The 160-strong Sri Lankan contingent’s management possessed the passports of all members to ensure they returned home. 
That failed to deter some from leaving. 
British police located the first three that disappeared, but as they had not violated local laws and held visas valid for six months, no action was taken, the Sri Lankan official said. 
“In fact, the police got us to return the passports that we were holding as a deterrent against defections,” the official said. 
“The police have not told us about their whereabouts.” 
Britain’s West Midlands police force, which covers Birmingham, said it was looking into reports of six Sri Lankans going missing from the Games, and said “inquiries continue to ensure they are safe and well”. 
The force declined to comment further, including on the claim of there being 10 missing people in total, and the UK interior ministry also refused to comment. 
Sri Lanka had won one silver and three bronze medals at the Games as of Sunday evening.
