0,4 murders in a row panic Muslims in New Mexico,Albuquerque Police Department says they are investigating a possible serial killer.,"WASHINGTON: Naeem Hussain was among thousands of mourners who gathered at the Islamic Center of New Mexico on Friday afternoon for the funerals of two Muslims who were ambushed and shot to death in the city of Albuquerque this week. Hours later, he too was killed.
Naeem was killed on Friday night in the parking lot of the Lutheran Family Services, which provides social support to refugees settled in the state of New Mexico. He was an Afghan refugee who lived with his family in Peshawar and Islamabad before migrating to the US.
Muhammad Afzal Hussein, 27, was killed on Monday less than a block from his apartment near the University of New Mexico and Aftab Hussain, 41, was killed on July 26 in the city’s international district.
The first victim of this senseless violence was 62-year-old Mohammad Ahmadi, who was killed in November behind the halal market he and his brother owned.

Latest victim killed on Friday after attending Afzal Hussein’s funeral

Tahir Gauba, director public relations at the Islamic Center of New Mexico (ICNM), told Dawn that the Albuquerque Police Department and the FBI briefed them on Thursday, “telling us that they believe all three deaths were connected.” This was before Naeem Hussain’s body was discovered. 
Afzal, whose family migrated from Rawalpindi, was an architect, graduate of the University of New Mexico (UNM), and headed a group of UNM alumni.
“Afzal’s death really shook the community and also alarmed the local police,” Mr Gauba said.
“He was prominent in the community and was Director Planning at the nearby city of Española.”
It was Afzal who initiated the community’s liaison with the police, about six months ago and was helping the local congresswoman in her re-election campaign as well.
Aftab, who was killed on July 26, was also an Afghan refugee from Peshawar.
Albuquerque, a city of about half a million people, has only 3,000 Muslims “but apparently that irks someone and that’s why they are targeting us,” Mr Gauba said.
The Albuquerque Police Department said they were investigating a possible serial killer, because the last three murders happened within five miles of each other in the last nine months.  “While we won’t go into why we think there’s a connection, there’s one strong commonality in all of our victims — their race and religion,” Deputy Commander Kyle Hartsock said.
“They also told us that there’s a strong possibility of a serial killer being involved in these murders,” Mr. Gauba said. “We have reached out to our senator, Martin Heinrich, to get more resources from the federal government.”
On the ICNM Facebook page, where the local mosque posted the video of the funeral prayer and dua, a local Muslim Nadina Barnes asked: “What safety plans are in place at ICNM?”
Imam Mahmoud Eldenawi urged the community not to panic.  “All of us, not only Muslim, are shocked and saddened at the murders of three innocent people,” he said. 
“The evil guy who committed this crime, doesn’t have any faith, sympathy, passion, mercy at all.”
Meanwhile, America’s largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation, based in Washington, D.C., announced a $5,000 reward for information that leads to an arrest and conviction in the case.  
Local media reports cited FBI statistics, showing religion-based hate crimes reached an historically high level in 2020 — the most recent year for which statistics are available. It said Muslims were the group that experienced the second-highest number of hate crimes across the country.  
“It is abhorrent that anyone would be attacked simply because of who they are, and we express our deep concern and support to the Muslim community of New Mexico,” said Anti-Defamation League’s regional director Scott Levin.

1,Fuel price hike triggers protests in Bangladesh,Demonstrators say the increases will disproportionately hit the country’s tens of millions of poor people.,"DHAKA: Thousands of Bangla­deshis besieged fuel stations across the country after the government raised prices by as much as 52 per cent, the largest jump on record, on the back of higher oil prices. 
Russia’s invasion of Ukr­aine has seen global energy prices soar, though oil has fallen back in recent weeks as recession fears mount. 
Dhaka announced on Fri­day that the price of petrol was going up by 51.7pc and diesel by 42.5pc from midnight. Motorcycle riders rac­ed to fuel stations nationwide to try and fill up before the price rise went into effect. Some stations paused sales, and sporadic protests broke out. 
Demonstrators said the increases would disproportionately hit the country’s tens of millions of poor people, who use diesel to power transport and farming irrigation pumps. In Sylhet, retailers tried to impose the higher prices immediately after the hike was announced, Police Com­m­issioner Nisharul Arif said.

2,Eight more killed as Kabul rocked by another blast,Militant group IS claims responsibility.,"KABUL: A bomb blast in a busy shopping street in Afghanistan’s capital Kabul on Saturday killed at least eight people and injured 22, hospital officials and witnesses said.
Islamic State, a militant group, claimed responsibility for the attack, the group said on its Telegram channel.
A senior medical officer at a private hospital said at least eight people died and 22 were wounded in the attack. 
The bomb exploded in a western district of the city where members of the minority Shia community regularly meet. 

Militant group IS claims responsibility again

An interior ministry spokesman said an investigation team was at the blast site to help the wounded and assess casualties. Footage posted online showed ambulances rushing to the scene, which is also near bus stations.
The attack came ahead of Ashura, a commemoration of the martyrdom of Imam Hussain, grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
Earlier on Friday, at least eight people were killed and 18 injured in a blast in a west Kabul neighbourhood that is mainly inhabited by members of the ethnic Hazara community. The blast was claimed by the militant Islamic State group.
Islamic State does not control any territory in Afghanistan but it has sleeper cells that have been attacking religious minorities in the country as well as patrols by the ruling Taliban. 
The Taliban authorities, who took over Afghanistan in August last year after a two-decade insurgency, said they would provide more protection for mosques where Shia offer prayers and other facilities.
Sayed Kazum Hojat, a religious scholar in Kabul, said the Taliban government had ramped up security ahead of Ashura but should improve vigilance. 
On Friday, a bomb attached to a handcart exploded in Kabul, officials said, killing eight civilians in an area largely inhabited by Afghanistan’s minority Shia Muslim community. The blast also injured 18 people, police spokesman Khalid Zadran said in a statement. 
The number of violent public attacks across the country has fallen since the Taliban returned to power in August last year, but IS has continued to target Shia population.
No up-to-date census data exists, but estimates put the size of the Shia community between 10 and 20 per cent of the population of 39 million including Persian-speaking Tajiks and Pashtuns as well as Hazaras.

3,Musk challenges Twitter CEO to public debate on bots,Elon Musk on Saturday challenged Twitter Inc Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal to a public debate about the...,"Elon Musk on Saturday challenged Twitter Inc Chief Executive Officer Parag Agrawal to a public debate about the percentage of bots on the social media platform.
“Let him prove to the public that Twitter has 5% fake or spam daily users!,” Musk said in a tweet.
He also started a poll asking users whether less than 5% of Twitter daily users are fake/spam.
Twitter on Thursday dismissed a claim by Musk that he was hoodwinked into signing a $44 billion agreement to buy the company.
Musk filed a countersuit against Twitter on July 29, escalating his legal fight against the company over his bid to walk away from the purchase agreement.
Earlier on Saturday, Musk said that if Twitter could provide its method of sampling 100 accounts and how it confirmed that the accounts are real, his deal to buy the company should proceed on its original terms.

4,N-plant parts damaged in strikes: Ukraine,EU slams Russia’s military activities around Zaporizhzhia.,"KYIV: Parts of Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant were “seriously damaged” by military strikes that forced one of its reactors to shut down, the plant’s operator said on Saturday.
The Friday strikes on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in south Ukraine — Europe’s largest atomic power complex — “seriously damaged” a station containing nitrogen and oxygen and an “auxiliary building,” Energoatom said on the Telegram messaging service.
Kyiv and Moscow blamed each other for the attacks.
The strikes had damaged a power cable, forced one of the reactors to stop working and “there are still risks of leaking hydrogen and radioactive substances, and the risk of fire is also high,” Energoatom said. The shelling “has caused a serious risk for the safe operation of the plant”. 
Russian troops have occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant since the early days of their invasion and Kyiv has accused them of storing heavy weapons there. But Moscow, in turn, has accused Ukrainian forces of targeting the plant.

EU slams Russia’s military activities around Zaporizhzhia

IAEA be given access to plant: EU
The European Union hit out at Russia on Saturday over the shelling. “The EU condemns Russia’s military activities around #Zaporiz­hzhia nuclear power plant,” the bloc’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, wrote on Twitter.
“This is a serious and irresponsible breach of nuclear safety rules and another example of Russia’s disregard for international norms.” Borrell insisted that the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the Interna­tional Atomic Energy Agency, be given access to the plant.
The IAEA has been trying for weeks to send a team to inspect the plant.
Ukraine has so far rejected the efforts, which it says would legitimise Russia’s occupation of the site in the eyes of the international community. It said employees of Russian nuclear operator Rosatom had left the plant shortly before the attacks but that Ukrainian personnel had stayed on and the plant was still generating electricity.
Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier on Friday said, “Any bombing of this site is a shameless crime, an act of terror.” And the Ukrainian foreign ministry said, “The possible consequences of hitting a working reactor are equivalent to using an atomic bomb”.
Earlier in the week, the IAEA said the situation at the nuclear power plant was “volatile.” “Every principle of safety has been violated one way or the other,” IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said.

5,The CIA spy tasked with finding Bin Laden and Zawahiri,Gary Schroen blamed George W. Bush’s incursion into Iraq for US ‘losing momentum’ in Afghan theatre.,"• Langley’s former Pakistan ‘station chief’, who orchestrated the search for Al Qaeda’s top leaders, lived just long enough to see Zawahiri taken out
• Gary Schroen blamed George W. Bush’s incursion into Iraq for US ‘losing momentum’ in Afghan theatre
HOURS after two Al Qaeda-hijacked planes slam­med into New York City’s twin towers on Septe­mber 11, 2001, CIA officer Gary Schroen stepped into his boss’s office, where he received a set of orders: “Capture Bin Laden, kill him, and bring his head back in a box on dry ice”.
The former CIA ‘station chief’ in Afghanistan and Pakistan, who was tasked with hunting down the head of Al Qaeda and his deputies — including Ayman al Zawahiri — at the beginning of the millennium, lived just long enough to see his life’s work come to fruition.
According to a BBC News obituary, the 80-year-old Schroen died of a stroke on August 1, a day after Zaw­ahiri was tracked down and assassinated by a US drone at his Kabul safe house.
During his stint as the CIA’s top man in the so-called ‘Af-Pak’ region in the 1980s and 1990s, Schroen had amassed a wealth of contacts and experience in the Afghan theatre, including ties with the Northern Alliance that would prove key to his work in tracking Al Qaeda’s leaders more than two decades on.
In various interviews, he had alluded to the lack of Washington’s interest in Afghanistan during the first half of the 1990s.
“The Taliban were there. Everyone knew that they were committing human rights violations and were just a miserable government, treating their people terribly,” he said. “But really, no one back in Washi­ngton really cared that much.”
By 1996, however, the “equation had changed” after US intelligence began to focus on the activities of Osama Bin Laden, a then-relatively unknown militant and veteran of the US-funded guerrilla war against the Soviets in the 1980s.
Schroen formed part of a small group within the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center that warned of the threat from the Saudi national. Schroen soon began re-establishing contact with Afghan commanders whom he had known from his time in the region.
For the next three years, at Schroen’s direction, the CIA repeatedly tried to kill or capture Bin Laden, with plans ranging from ambushes on his convoy and raids on his farm in southern Afghanistan to cruise missiles and bombing raids.
Ultimately, Bin Laden went on to orchestrate the bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and survived a large-scale cruise missile attack on Al-Qaeda bases in Afghan­istan’s Khost Province in August of that year.
Three years later, 19 Al-Qaeda hijackers launched the 9/11 attacks.
The 2001 mission to Afghanistan — officially known as Operation Jawbreaker — would see Schroen and seven other Americans link up with the Northern Alliance, a coalition of groups fighting the Taliban government that had ruled Afghanistan since 1996. When he got his orders, Schroen, then 59, was already 11 days into the CIA’s transition programme for employees going into retirement.
“I never expected I would get the call to go in,” he said years later. “I think it was the right choice, given my long relationship with those guys in the Northern Alliance.”
As a military operation, the invasion of Afghanistan was remarkably successful and drove the Taliban from power by December 2001. But Schroen’s main targets such as Bin Laden, Zawahiri and other senior Al-Qaeda figures escaped, while the Taliban regrouped and fought a long guerrilla war that culminated in the chaotic US withdrawal from Kabul last year.
In interviews later in his life, Schroen said the failure of the US to secure Afghanistan and capture its main enemies there was, in large part, due to a drain on both CIA and military resources caused by the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Despite initial claims from the US administration of George W Bush that the Iraqi government was somehow connected to the 9/11 attacks, Schroen said he never believed in any linkage.
“The number of guys, CIA personnel, out in these little remote camps and bases were reduced in number…because of demand to staff up the Iraq effort,” he told NPR in 2005. “It really did cost us, I think, a lot in momentum.”
