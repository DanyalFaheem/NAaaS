0,PTI leaders summoned as FIA launches funds probe,Ex-Sindh governor Imran Ismail issued notice in Karachi; former NA speaker Asad Qaiser in Peshawar.,"KARACHI / SWABI: Just a day after the Federal Inv­es­tigation Agency (FIA) con­stituted a panel to supervise teams in its respective zones investigation into the matter pertaining to the Election Commission of Pak­­istan (ECP) order in Pak­istan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) prohibited funding case, the agency’s provincial chapters summoned senior leaders of the party for next week to join the inquiry.
The FIA had on Friday constituted a five-member team to supervise inquiry teams of the agency’s respe­ctive zones probing into the prohibited funding case. Hea­ded by its Director Muh­a­m­mad Athar Waheed, the monitoring team would be responsible for coordination with and guiding the respective inquiry teams in each zone, according to a notification issued by the agency’s economic crimes wing director. Its members would be FIA’s Additional Director Khalid Anees, Deputy Director Khawaja Hammad, Chaudhry Ijaz Ahmed and Assistant Director Ijaz Ahmed Sheikh.
The team was notified just a few days after a three-member ECP bench in a unanimous verdict ruled that the PTI received prohibited funding from 351 foreign companies and 34 foreign nationals. As per the notification, the probe is being conducted under Section 6 of the Political Parties Order 2002.
In Karachi, the agency summoned former Sindh governor Imran Ismail and MPA Dr Seema Zia. Sources said the FIA has also sought details from two private banks where the party was operating four accounts, which came under the radar after the ECP verdict. All four accounts, they said, were opened and operated in Karachi.

“Imran Ismail has been asked to appear [before the FIA] on Aug 15 and record his statement,” said the source privy to the development. “Before him, Dr Zia will appear to record her statement on Aug 12. In the meantime, two banks have been asked to furnish details of the four accounts they were operating for the PTI — three in Habib Bank Limited and one in BankIslami Pakistan Limited,” the source added.
Following directives from the top, FIA Karachi Director Abdullah Sheikh constituted a five-member team led by its Deputy Director Rabia Qureshi and comprising Assistant Director Abdul Rauf Sheikh, inspectors Aftab Wattoo and Sabin Ghori and Sub-Inspector Rahat Ali Khan.
When asked about the total number of accounts the party was operating in Karachi, the source said details of only four had emerged during the initial probe.
“The FIA team in Karachi is only coordinating with the headquarters in Islamabad, which is actually supervising the probe into this case,” said an FIA official explaining the agency’s Karachi chapter role.
Meanwhile, the FIA Lahore chapter has summoned the PTI’s Punjab Minister Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed for Aug 11 in his party’s prohibited funding case.
“A call-up notice has been issued to senior PTI leader Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed for Aug 11 to join the FIA’s investigation into the party’s prohibited funding case at its Lahore office,” according to an official. Mr Rashid was on Saturday sworn in as the provincial local government and community development minister.
Moreover, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser also received the FIA Peshawar chapter’s call-up notice at his native Swabi residence on Saturday evening, summoning him for Aug 11 at the KP office of the agency.
The notice, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated the inquiry was being conducted by the FIA Peshawar in light of the ECP order into the alleged illegalities committed in the opening/operating of two bank accounts — Bank Islami (KASB) and Habib Bank Limited, Peshawar. Mr Qaiser has been asked to appear in person and answer questions pertaining to the mentioned accounts “along with any additional supplementary question put to you with [truthfulness] and honesty”.
Earlier, the former speaker told the media that the election commission was a constitutional body whose reputation had been tarnished by its incumbent chairman. “The chairman’s controversial and partisan role is under a tight watch of the PTI.”
He stressed he would not be intimidated by such high-handed tactics and vowed to continue to work for the people with complete determination. He called the PTI the only political party that ran its affairs according to the laws of the land, adding those who had looted public money and stashed it abroad were making the country bankrupt.
Qaiser questioned why the ECP failed to take action against other political parties, saying the action should be across the board.

1,PML-N counting on parliament to pave way for Nawaz’s return,Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah says party supremo will spearhead election campaign.,"LAHORE:  The Pakistan Mus­lim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government is considering relevant legislation to ease the return of its supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, who is in a self-imposed exile in London on medical grounds, to Pakistan.
PML-N leader and interior minister Rana Sanaullah has already said the coalition government might make certain amendments that would help repeal the ban imposed on Mr Sharif by a Supreme Court judgement in the Panama Papers case against him.
“The parliament can undo the lifetime ban on politicians and it may not be struck down by the court,” an insider told Dawn. 
“Nawaz Sharif will be the ultimate beneficiary if this legislation is brought to parliament and subsequently adopted,” the insider said, adding that the introduction of this legislation would be linked to the outcome of the Supreme Court Bar Association’s petition in the apex court challenging lifetime ban on politicians.
Earlier, PML-N Vice-President Maryam Nawaz had hinted that her father wanted to come back but there were ‘certain problems’ hindering his return. She was referring to legal problems as Nawaz Sharif will have to go to jail on his return in the Al Azizia corruption reference. Besides, she had also referred to not getting a ‘green light’ from the powerful circles for his return. 

Sanaullah says party supremo will spearhead election campaign

After Shehbaz Sharif managed to become the premier in April last, some PML-N leaders were excited hoping that their supreme leader would now be among them soon. 
But legal hiccups are said to be the main hurdles in his return plans. 
Nawaz vs Imran
Nawaz Sharif will likely make his return to Pakistan ahead of the general elections as PML-N leaders think his presence in the field is necessary to stop Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) juggernaut.
In the face of the rising popularity of the PTI chairman who was ousted as the prime minister in April this year, the entire PML-N leadership is unanimous that the party needs Nawaz to be in Pakistan ahead of the polls if it wants to score a victory.
“Embarrassing defeat in the last month’s by-polls in Punjab has consolidated this view within the party that second-tier leadership like Maryam Nawaz and [PM] Shehbaz Sharif cannot compete with Mr Khan’s charisma,” an insider told Dawn.
Despite an aggressive campaign by Ms Nawaz, the PML-N faced a crushing defeat in the by-polls held on July 22 that cost Punjab to the Sharifs. “Only Nawaz can handle Imran Khan in the political field as per the PML-N senior leadership,” the insider added.                                   
Meanwhile, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah dismissed rumours about the immediate return of the elder Sharif. He, however, confirmed that Mr Sharif return ahead of the next general elections to spearhead the party’s campaign.
“There has been a talk in the party about the return of Nawaz Sharif. He is likely to return to Pakistan ahead of the next elections whenever they take place to spearhead the PML-N’s campaign,” Sanaullah said on a private TV channel.
Mr Sanaullah was referring to the claims made by PML-N leader Javid Latif who had claimed that Nawaz Sharif was thinking of coming back to Pakistan in mid-September. 
Mr Latif has been passionately appealing to his party chief to come back before it is too late to counter Imran Khan.
Nawaz in London
An ‘ailing’ Nawaz Sharif has been living in London since November 2019 for medical treatment after the high court allowed him a four-week reprieve. He was serving seven-year imprisonment in the Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore in the Al-Azizia corruption case before his departure to London on medical grounds.
Prior to his exit, his younger brother Shehbaz had submitted an undertaking to the Lahore High Court ensuring his elder brother would return “within four weeks or on certification by doctors that he has regained his health and is fit to return back to Pakistan”. However, the return is repeatedly delayed due to health concerns.
Nawaz Sharif’s passport expired in February 2021. However, the junior Sharif’s government issued a fresh passport to the elder Sharif in April this year.
It may be mentioned here that in August last year, Nawaz Sharif filed an appeal with the British Immigration Tribunal after the Home Department refused to extend his stay in the country on “medical grounds” any further. Mr Sharif can legally remain in the UK till the tribunal issues its decision on his plea for his stay in the country.

2,Rs5bn grant okayed for flood-hit people,"PM Shehbaz announces setting up of relief fund, urges well-off citizens to support flood affectees with generous donations.","ISLAMABAD: The Eco­no­mic Coordination Comm­ittee (ECC) of the cabinet at a special meeting on Sat­urday approved technical supplementary grant of Rs5 billion to be used for rescue and relief activities and as compensation for deaths and injuries caused by floods during the year.
Separately, Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif, who visited flood-hit areas over the past week, announced setting up ‘Prime Minister’s Relief Fund’ and appealed to the philanthropists and well-off segments of society to support flood affectees with generous donations.
According to the ECC decision, the amount will be allocated from contingency provision of Finance Divi­sion as block provision to the National Disaster Manage­ment Fund (NDMF). 
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail, who chaired the mee­ting, ordered immediate transfer of funds for timely help of flood affectees. The directive came after the Nat­ional Disaster Management Authority presented a summary for allocation of funds on the PM’s instructions.
The NDMA chairman requested the ECC that block allocation of Rs5bn may be made to NDMF.
Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Dr Aisha Ghous Pasha, Coordi­na­tor to the PM on Comm­erce and Industry Rana Ihsan Afzal, Coordinator to the PM on Economy Bilal Azhar Kayani, federal secretaries and other senior officers attended the meeting.
Relief Fund
The prime minister while presiding over a separate meeting said the countrymen had already set a precedent in the world by making generous donations during the 2005 earthquake and 2010 floods to support the affected populace.
The donations can be deposited in Account No: G-12164 of the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund 2022.
Mr Sharif observed that the historic rainfall had triggered huge catastrophe which had badly affected Balochistan, leaving a trail of unmatched destruction.
Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab were also badly hit, he said, adding that despite the difficult financial situation, the government had released Rs5bn for the affected families.
The prime minister urged the wealthy people to support the government’s efforts in the rehabilitation work. The affected brothers, sisters and children required support with the rekindling of the Ansar-i-Madina-like passion, he said.
The federal government has already declared an emergency situation in the flood-affected areas. The provincial governments had also been urged to declare them as calamity-hit areas so that relief and rehabilitation efforts could be expedited.
Meanwhile, the Federal Flood Commission has said that River Indus is flowing in medium flood at Guddu (downstream Taunsa) and in low flood at Sukkur.
According to the daily FFC report for Saturday, all other main rivers of the Indus River System — Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej  rivers, including the Indus at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma and Kotri — have normal flow conditions at present.

3,Israeli strikes destroy homes in Gaza amid calls for restraint,"Tel Aviv warns deadly operations could last a week; FO, Shehbaz and Imran strongly condemn air strikes...","GAZA CITY: Israel struck in Gaza and Palestinians fired rockets at Israeli cities on Saturday, as cross-border fire reverberated for a second day in the worst escalation since last year’s war.
Health authorities in Gaza, controlled by militant group Hamas, said a five-year-old girl was among 13 people killed by the Israeli bombardment, adding that more than 110 others have been wounded.
Israel on Friday killed a senior commander of the Islamic Jihad militant group in a surprise daytime air strike on a high-rise building in Gaza City, which drew rocket salvos in response.
On Saturday, Israel said it struck the group’s militants preparing to launch rockets and militant posts. Additional bombings targeted five houses, witnesses said, sending huge clouds of smoke and debris into the air as explosions rocked Gaza City.

Tel Aviv warns deadly operations could last a week; FO, Shehbaz and Imran strongly condemn air strikes

Israel’s military has warned deadly aerial operations in Gaza could last a week. The Jewish state claimed it was forced to launch a “pre-emptive” operation against Islamic Jihad, insisting the militant group was planning an imminent attack following days of tensions along the border with Gaza, a Palestinian enclave.
Sources within Islamic Jihad ruled out a ceasefire soon, with one saying: “for the moment the focus is on the battlefield”.
Israel and Islamic Jihad confirmed the killing of Taysir al-Jabari, a  key leader of the militant group, in a Friday strike on a building in  the west of Gaza city.
Daily life in the enclave has come to a standstill, with streets largely deserted and most shops closed. Its sole power station ground to a halt due to a lack of fuel after Israel closed its border crossings days earlier, according to the electricity distributor.
Civilians on the Israeli side meanwhile repeatedly fled to air shelters, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.
‘Declaration of war’
Islamic Jihad is aligned with Hamas, but often acts independently. It declared that the initial Israeli bombardment amounted to a “declaration of war”.
In a nationally televised address on Friday, Israel’s Prime Minister Yair Lapid had warned the country “isn’t interested in a wider conflict in Gaza but will not shy away from one either”.
Jamal al-Fadi, a political science professor at Gaza’s Al-Azhar University, said he expected the violence to end “within days”.
“Islamic Jihad is reacting in a limited manner and by doing so is preventing the occupation (Israeli military) from intensifying its airstrikes,” he said.
Mohammed Abu Salameh, the director of Shifa, Gaza City’s main hospital, said medics are facing “acute shortages of medical supplies”.
On Friday, the health ministry reported “a five-year-old girl, targeted by the Israeli occupation” was among those killed.
The girl, Alaa Kaddum, had a pink bow in her hair and a wound on her forehead, as her body was carried by her father at her funeral.
Pakistan denounces killing of Palestinians
Pakistan strongly condemned the Israeli airstrikes in Gaza. “Martyrdom of 10 Palestinians, including a five-year-old girl, in Gaza is the latest act of Israeli terrorism,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif tweeted on Saturday. “If impunity and barbarism had a face, it would have been that of Israel, which has targeted Palestinians without any care for consequences.”
The Foreign Office spokesperson said the latest spate of aggression was typical of the Israeli atrocities, illegal actions and indiscriminate use of force against innocent Palestinians over the decades in complete defiance of international human rights and humanitarian laws.
“Pakistan calls upon the international community to urge Israel to put an immediate end to the blatant use of force and flagrant violations of human rights of the Palestinian people,” he said in a statement.
“It is imperative to immediately stop the aggression. We renew our call for a viable, independent and contiguous Palestinian State, with pre-1967 borders, and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital being the only just, comprehensive and lasting solution of the Palestinian question, in accordance with the relevant United Nations and OIC resolutions,” he added.
PTI chairman Imran Khan said Israeli forces launched air strikes against Palestinians in sheer violation of all international laws. “Israel is trying to use its massive military power to subjugate the Palestinian people and eliminate those who stand up for their rights and for end to Israeli occupation,” he tweeted.
“We stand with the brave Palestinian people and ask world powers to break their silence and act against Israeli atrocities committed on the Palestinian people,” he said in another Twitter post and reiterated that peace could only come through a viable two-state solution.
Global reaction
Britain called for a “swift end to the violence” in the Gaza Strip, while the United States urged calm from both sides. Washington, however, stuck to its old line that Israel had the right to defend itself. 
“We certainly urge all sides to avoid further escalation... We absolutely fully support Israel’s right to defend itself against terrorist groups that are taking the lives of innocent civilians in Israel,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.
Russia, whose ties with Israel have been tested by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, appeared to pin initial blame on the Jewish state.
Foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Moscow was calling “on all the parties involved to show maximum restraint”.
“The new escalation was caused by Israeli army firing into the Gaza Strip on Aug 5, to which Palestinian groups responded by carrying out massive and indiscriminate bombardments on Israeli territory,” she said.
The European Union called for maximum restraint. The EU “follows with great concern the latest developments in and around Gaza”, a spokesman for the EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.
United Nations Middle East peace envoy Tor Wennesland said he was “deeply concerned”, warning that the escalation was “very dangerous”.
Egypt, historically a broker between Israel and armed groups in Gaza, has reportedly been seeking to mediate and may host a delegation from Islamic Jihad over the weekend.
The Arab League “condemned in the strongest possible terms the ferocious Israeli aggression against Gaza”, whereas Jordan’s foreign ministry has “stressed the importance of halting the Israeli aggression”.
Iran, a supporter of Gaza militants, said the territory was “not alone” in its fight. “We are with you on this path until the end, and let Palestine and the Palestinians know that they are not alone,” Revolutionary Guards chief Maj Gen Hossein Salami told Islamic Jihad leader Ziad al-Nakhala during a meeting in Tehran.

5,4 killed in gun attack on PTI MPA in Lower Dir,Rescuers say Malik Liaqat Khan was returning home after attending a funeral in Gal Maidan when his vehicle came under attack.,"LOWER DIR: A gun attack targeting the vehicle of a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) MPA Malik Liaqat Khan in Lower Dir claimed at least four lives, including a police constable and Levies sepoy, on Saturday and left the PTI lawmaker wounded.
Rescue officials said the nephew and brother of the MPA also lost their lives in the firing incident, which took place in the jurisdiction of the Zaimdara police station. The MPA was returning home after attending a funeral in Gal Maidan when his vehicle came under attack on Saturday night, rescuers said.

6,"More medals for Pakistan as Sharif gets silver, Asad bronze",Mohammad Sharif Tahir loses 9-0 to India's Naveen Kumar in the 74kg final.,"BIRMINGHAM: Pakistan’s wrestlers continued picking up medals at the Commonwealth Games but a gold proved elusive yet again on Saturday.
Mohammad Sharif Tahir, in his maiden international event, went closest at the Coventry Arena. But just like compatriot Inam Butt on Friday, he couldn’t get a final victory against an opponent from arch-rivals India.
Sharif lost 9-0 to Naveen Kumar in the 74kg final, his defeat coming moments after his team-mate Ali Asad had picked up bronze by swatting New Zealand’s Suraj Singh 11-0 in the 57kg competition.
Ali had earlier lost to cross-border rival Ravi Kumar and India domination of Pakistan in the ring was extended later in the evening when Tayyab Raza lost his 97kg bronze medal match 2-10 to Deepak Nehra.
The Pakistan trio had all advanced to the semi-finals in their respective categories but only Sharif was able to go through to the final.
After Pakistan’s top wrestler Inam had lost to Deepak Punia in the 86kg final, Sharif had a chance to get revenge for his country. But Naveen was dominant in the first period and did not let Sharif take any points. The Indian grappler took a 2-0 lead in the first period by pinning his opponent.
In the final three minutes, Naveen managed to hold his ground before pinning and rolling Sharif in the ring to walk away with a gold medal.
Sharif began his campaign with an 11-0 victory over Tonga’s John Vake in the round of 16 before overcoming Canadian Jasmit Singh Phulka 5-1 to reach the semis, where he overwhelmed Cole Hawkins 11-0 for a win by technical superiority.
Ali, meanwhile, had 10-0 wins in both his last-16 and quarter-final clashes against Harvey Ridings of England and Namibian Romio Ricardo Goliath, respectively. But he couldn’t advance to the final after falling 4-14 to Ravi.
Tayyab made a similar journey to the 97kg semis, blanking Rashji Mackey and Cameron Nicol 10-0 in his opening two rounds, but Nishan Randhawa proved too strong — the Canadian winning 7-0 on points.
With the wrestling programme concluding on Saturday, Tayyab became the only member from the Pakistan squad to return empty-handed after Inam and Zaman Anwar had earned silver medals and Inayatullah bronze on Friday. Pakistan’s only gold medal at the Games so far has been won by weightlifter Nooh Dastagir Butt. 
Elsewhere, Pakistan’s wait for a first track and field medal at the Games since 1966 continued after Shajar Abbas finished last in the men’s 200m final at the Alexander Stadium on Saturday night.
Trinidad and Tobago’s Jereem Richards defended his title in a Games record time of 19.80 seconds. Shajar’s time was 21.16 seconds.
