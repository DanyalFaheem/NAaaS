RI President Jennifer Jones on Saturday said Rotary was constantly trying to improve people’s lifestyle and economic situation through welfare projects.
“Rotary has rendered valuable services in Pakistan; now it is time to start new welfare projects with new commitment from the platform of Rotary in Pakistan.” she said at a press briefing at a local hotel.
“Rotary’s PolioPlus investment in Pakistan for polio eradication is $353.8 million and overall its global contribution has been around $2.5 billion. Rotary is committed to keep contributing until the world becomes polio free,” Ms Jones said.
Appreciating the performance of Rotary in Pakistan during natural disasters, she said be it earthquake situation or flood disaster, Rotary had always played a role in providing immediate relief to the victims and their rehabilitation.
Earlier, Ms Jones visited the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) and met the leadership of the Pakistan Polio Eradication Initiative.
The visit has come at a crucial time as Pakistan’s polio programme strengthens operations and adopts new strategies to contain the virus.
“At the start of my presidency, I’m proud to highlight and prioritise Rotary’s top goal of polio eradication by touring Pakistan - one of two remaining endemic countries - and spotlighting the women health workers who play a critical role in protecting children from this vaccine-preventable disease,” she said in a meeting at the NEOC.
Representatives of the government, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Unicef, WHO and CDC were also present.
Ms Jones is Rotary’s first woman president since the organisation was founded in 1905.
“Rotary’s spirit of service above self is an inspiration to people all over the world. Some of us sitting here may not have been able to walk today if Rotarians had not envisioned a polio-free world,” NEOC coordinator Shahzad Baig said.
Polio Director for WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Region Dr Hamid Jafari said: “Polio programmes around the world have benefited greatly from the contributions of women at the forefront. It is heartening to see President Jones motivating women vaccinators, who make up 65pc of the polio workforce in Pakistan.”

2,No progress on establishment of Gandhara Heritage Centre,"Last year, CDA board decided to set up centre in F-9 Citizen Club; proposal approved by govt.","ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has failed to set up the Gandhara Heritage and Culture and Convention Centre at the F-9 Citizen Club in the light of its board decision, as the building is still being used as a mass vaccination centre.
Officials told Dawn that last year the CDA board had decided to establish the centre in Citizen Club and sent a proposal to the federal cabinet which was approved. However, the civic agency is yet to take steps for establishing the centre.
The officials said that the Covid-19 vaccination centre was set up in the building last year and a couple of months ago it was given a six months’ extension. Therefore, until the vaccination centre is operational there, the CDA cannot start work on the establishment of the heritage centre.

Last year, CDA board decided to set up centre in F-9 Citizen Club; proposal approved by govt

“Now, we are waiting for the conclusion of the extended period of the vaccination centre. Once the club building is vacated, we will start work on the setting up of the heritage centre,” said an official of the CDA.
Last year, the then prime minister Imran Khan visited the Citizen Club building, which had been lying underutilised for years. He had formed a committee, comprising CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed and architect Nayyar Ali Dada, to propose a viable utility plan for the building. This committee proposed setting up of the Gandhara Heritage Centre.
Spread over 22 acres with a 265,000 square feet covered area, the building has facilities such as restaurants, an indoor pool, gym, lobby, aerobic area and a fitness centre. The project was started by the CDA in 2008 but when the structure was completed, the Supreme Court in 2010 took up the matter and ruled that the building cannot be used as a club.
The CDA officials said the civic agency’s board had approved rules for the centre and decided that a board of governors will manage it. It was also decided that the citizens would have access to the facilities in the club and there will be no mandatory membership.
It had also decided that the centre may be used for holding conventions, exhibitions and provision of sports facilities, including a gym.
The officials said the civic agency wanted to shift the mass Covid-19 vaccination centre to the adjacent building of the CDA environment wing in F-9 Park. However, the plan could not be executed and in the meanwhile the vaccination centre got a six months’ extension.

The petitioner, Fida Hussain Hashmi, a local lawyer, contended that following withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan in August last year, about 400 Afghan people along with their families came to Islamabad without any legal documentation and encroached upon the greenbelts of F-6. 
They were seeking asylum in the US.
The petitioner contended that the illegal immigrants claimed that they were promised safe exit from Afghanistan to the US, adding that they had occupied the greenbelts and the surrounding of the National Press Club and intermittently staged protests against the US embassy.
As per the petition, after the withdrawal of the US forces, situation in Pakistan had drastically changed and in the present situation when Pakistan was already facing turmoil and threat of terrorism, the country could not afford such protests in the federal capital.
The petition pointed out that these illegal immigrants could not be treated as Pakistani citizens and their demonstration to claim any right was not protected under the Constitution.
The petition cited secretaries of foreign affairs, interior, inspector general of police, Islamabad and Capital Development Authority (CDA) chairman as respondents.
The petition requested the court to issue directions to the ministries of interior and foreign affairs to clarify the legal status of the Afghan refugees and ask the CDA and police to shift these undocumented immigrants from the greenbelts to the refugee camp.

6,Rights body ready to help end animal testing in medical schools,PETA says outdated and cruel testing in Pakistan must be replaced by non-animal methods.,"ISLAMABAD: People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a US-based animal rights non-profit organisation, has offered to help Pakistan implement humane practices in veterinary and medical schools and end animal testing in Pakistan through a series of reforms.
The offer was made during a zoom meeting between the prime minister’s strategic reforms adviser, Salman Sufi, and PETA President Ingrid Newkirk, Chief of the Science Advancement and Outreach Division Dr Katherine Roe and Vice President of International Laboratory Methods Shalin Gala on July 22, 2022.
PETA had approached Mr Sufi, after a viral video footage revealed veterinary students in at least three institutions in Pakistan were involved in inhumane practices on animals, such as operating on animals without anaesthetics and denying them post-operative care despite excruciating pain.
On June 30, Salman Sufi announced an initial set of historic strategic reforms that included barring animals from being used for live testing in any veterinary college or industrial complex in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).
 







PETA says outdated and cruel testing in Pakistan must be replaced by non-animal methods

“This is a great start and we fully support this measure, and we agreed that more can and should be done since many of the veterinary schools are geographically outside of ICT and are not obligated to follow this new reform policy,” said PETA in a response.
It underscored Pakistan should issue a circular or a regulatory reform that explicitly embraced humane simulation training models for veterinary education and ban training methods that were not medically necessary and did not directly benefit animals involved at the federal level or through the Pakistan Veterinary Medical Council.
PETA cited numerous simulation models for both basic and advanced veterinary and zoology training, such as SynDaver Surgical Canine model, the Critical Care Jerry and Critical Care Fluffy models, the Virtual Animal Anatomy, and Biosphera softwares, to avoid harming animals during the training.
“As such, we are proposing a new collaboration with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Salman Sufi to help provide advanced simulation models so that universities in Pakistan can transition to harm-free and humane veterinary education. We are currently working with Salman Sufi to gather information and do an assessment of the universities’ needs with respect to acquiring simulation models so we can best plan how to assist them,” Mr Gala said.
In response to questions on areas of collaboration with Pakistan, PETA shared more topics that it was addressing with Mr Sufi, such as modernising medical training.
Shalin Gala said before the current Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) came into being, PETA was in communication with the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) to advise them on various reforms for their undergraduate medical (or MBBS) curriculum to replace the use of animals nationwide with non-animal methods.
According to Mr Gala, PETA had advised them to adopt its proposed curriculum reform language stating, “no animals or animal parts shall be used for any aspect of the MBBS curriculum including but not limited to practical labs, learning objectives, contents, teaching/learning strategy, teaching aids and assessments. Only non-animal teaching, learning, demonstration and assessment methods shall be used such as didactic methods, interactive computer-aided learning (CAL), human patient simulators (HPS), human cadavers, supervised clinical practice or other non-animal models”.
This reform, if enacted, would mirror similar reforms adopted internationally as well, he added.
“We would like for Pakistan’s MBBS curriculum to have the same non-animal training standard and use modern simulation technology. We hope to work with Salman Sufi to move this strategic reform forward, which will put Pakistan’s medical education system in sync with the US, Canada, India and others that no longer use animals for undergraduate medical training,” Mr Gala said.
In 2014, following discussions with PETA India, the University Grants Commission in India issued a notification ending dissection and experimentation, for training purposes, in university and college zoology and life sciences undergraduate and postgraduate courses, sparing 19 million animals in that country alone from being killed and cut apart for dissection every year.
PETA asserted its scientists were eager to work with Mr Sufi on setting up a national database in Pakistan for approved non-animal biomedical research and training methods, and drafting regulatory language that the use of animals for such purposes must be replaced by approved non-animal methods that appear in the database.
It also intended to assist conduct scientific reviews of the efficacy of animal use to identify additional areas in which such use had failed to advance human health, or in which non-animal methods were now available, and could be ended quickly.
While technical skills were important, it was also of the utmost importance to instill a culture of care in veterinary training. Creating a dichotomy between the animals used for training and the animal companions seen in an examination room did not benefit the veterinary profession, according to PETA.
“We are currently exploring ways to create materials relevant to Pakistani society and potentially incorporating this compassion-building programme into current school curricula,” the animal rights organisation said.
In response to a question on trafficking of animals, PETA said Mr Sufi mentioned his proposed reform to seize wildlife held in unsuitable living conditions and repatriate them to relevant countries for rehabilitation.

Talking to Dawn, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Tahir Farooq said  over 500 armymen and 300 Rangers had been deployed in the garrison city for Muharram 7 and Ashura processions. He said the control room was set up at the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation from where the city would be monitored through 300 close circuit TV (CCTV) cameras.
He said before the Muharram 7 procession, the district administration completed arrangements of lighting and repaired roads on its route while the health authority set up camps along the route.
The district administration also banned the entry of 39 clerics of different schools of thought and issued gagging orders for 16 others.
As many as 12 clerics whose entry was banned belonged to the Deobandi and one each to Barelvi, Shia and Ahle Hadith schools of thought. Moreover, 39 others were stopped from delivering speeches.
Mr Farooq issued directives to ban the entry of 39 clerics in the district for two months.
He also issued gagging orders for 16 clerics. “I am satisfied on the basis of City Police Officer report to prevent these persons from delivering speeches/sermons at public places and religious gatherings in the revenue limits of Rawalpindi district for 60 days with immediate effect,” the order stated.

8,Cost of sewage treatment plant project rises by Rs2 billion,CDA prepares revised PC-I for submission to Planning Commission...,"ISLAMABAD: The estimated cost of the proposed sewage treatment plants (STPs) project for Rawal Dam’s catchment area has seen an increase of around two billion rupees.
Earlier, the estimated cost of the project was around Rs4 billion which in a revised PC-I has been estimated at Rs6 billion.  A few days ago, the CDA prepared the revised PC-I, which is going to be submitted to the Ministry of Interior for onward submission to Planning Commission.
The cost was increased due to the high inflation and increase in the value of the dollar against the rupee. Officials said the old PC-I had been prepared when the value of the rupee was Rs138 per dollar.  Similarly, they said construction material prices also saw a significant increase during the last one year.
Under the project, the CDA is supposed to install three STPs in the dam’s catchment area to stop the flow of contaminated water into the reservoir.

CDA prepares revised PC-I for submission to Planning Commission

Plants are to be built in lower Shahdara, Bari Imam and near Banigala. In the absence of these plants, untreated sewage from unplanned localities in the catchment area flowed into Rawal Dam.
Last year, the CDA called bids, which were opened in July the same year, but the contract could not be awarded within the stipulated time. As a result, the bid’s validity time expired and now the civic agency is going to get approval of the revised PC-I from the Planning Commission before calling bids.
According to CDA officials, the PC-I was prepared on the direction of the Planning Commission as an engineering procurement and construction (EPC) mode project which meant that its design and engineering would be handled by an EPC contractor.
They said after awarding the tender last year, the civic body was supposed to get the revised PC-I’s approval from the Planning Commission. However, an objection was raised by the Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) that the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project had not been carried out. In the meantime, the bid’s validity period expired.
In its letter earlier this year, the CDA had informed the Planning Commission that if the project was carried out through the EPC mode, the EIA would not be conducted. It said under the EPC mode, the contractor was supposed to prepare the project’s design and the EIA could not be carried out without it.
Sources said in the revised PC-I, the CDA clearly mentioned that since the project was of the EPC mode, after a competitive process whoever wins the contract, within three months they would get the EIA done as they will first complete the detailed designing of the project.
“The contractor will do detailed designing and based on design he will go for EIA,” said an official of CDA, adding that soon after getting the revised PC-I the CDA will call tenders for awarding the contract. It is, in fact, an environment mitigation project. After being started, the project would have to be completed in 14 months for treating 9.6 million gallons of untreated water daily.
