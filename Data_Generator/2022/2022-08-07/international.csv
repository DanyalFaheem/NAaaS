“They were pilgrims heading for Medjugorje,” a Catholic sanctuary in neighbouring Bosnia that draws hundreds of thousands of visitors every year, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki tweeted.
The death toll rose from 11 after one of the injured died in hospital, Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic told a press conference in the northern city of Varadzin.
Eighteen of the 30 hurt, who were all taken to hospitals in the area, were in a serious condition, said Maja Grba Bujevic, head of Croatia’s emergency services. Sixteen emergency medical teams had been dispatched to the crash site.
“All the victims (are) Polish citizens,” said Lukasz Jasina, a spokesperson for Poland’s foreign ministry. The bus was registered in Poland, the spokesperson told the TVN24 channel in Warsaw.
Polish Health Minister Adam Niedzielski and Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz were expected to arrive in Croatia later in the day.
“A serious accident took place around 5:40am. The bus deviated and fell into a ditch off the highway,” police spokesman Marko Muric said. The crash occurred about 60 kilometres (40 miles) from Zagreb.
Croatia is one of Europe’s top tourist destinations, with millions flocking this summer to it stunning Adriatic coast. About 580,000 Polish tourists visited Croatia between January and July this year.
In July, 2021, ten tourists from Kosovo died in a bus crash on a highway in eastern Croatia.

1,White House calls Indiana abortion ban ‘devastating’,"WASHINGTON: The White House on Saturday assailed Indiana lawmakers for passing sweeping curbs on abortion access,...","WASHINGTON: The White House on Saturday assailed Indiana lawmakers for passing sweeping curbs on abortion access, calling it  “devastating” step for the Midwestern state.
Indiana on Friday became the first state to pass such a law since the Supreme Court in June struck down the constitutional right to an abortion, originally affirmed in the landmark Roe v. Wade case.
“The Indiana legislature took a devastating step as a result of the Supreme Court’s extreme decision to overturn Roe v. Wade 
and eliminate women’s constitutionally-protected right to abortion,” said a statement from White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre.
“It’s another radical step by Republican legislators to take away women’s reproductive rights and freedom, and put personal health care decisions in the hands of politicians rather than women and their doctors.” 
Both houses of the Republican-dominated Indiana legislature passed the abortion measure on Friday after weeks of bitter debate, and Governor Eric Holcomb, a Republican, quickly signed it.
When the measure takes effect Sept 15, it will allow abortions only in cases of rape, incest, lethal fetal abnormality or when a pregnant woman faces the risk of death or severe health problems.
Alexis McGill Johnson, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which advocates for abortion rights, called the law  “cruel” and  “devastating.” Jean-Pierre, in her statement, said Congress should  “act immediately to pass a law restoring the protections of Roe — the only way to secure a woman’s right to choose nationally.” 
Until then, she said,  “President Biden is committed to taking action to protect women’s reproductive rights and freedom.” While some conservative states earlier this year had preemptively passed  “trigger” laws to immediately prohibit abortion once the Supreme Court acted, Indiana lacked such a law.
Abortion there had been legal up to 22 weeks. It was to state capital Indianapolis that a 10-year-old girl, victim of rape, had traveled for an abortion when unable to obtain one in neighboring Ohio.
That story drew intense media attention, further fueling passions around the issue.
Abortion has long been deeply divisive in the US, and the Supreme Court’s decision ensured its centrality in the political debate ahead of midterm elections.
Democrats, who say the Supreme Court is seriously out of touch with the national mood, have seized on the result of a vote on Tuesday in heavily conservative Kansas, which chose overwhelmingly to preserve that state’s constitutional protection of abortion rights.

2,Taiwan official leading missile production found dead,Ou Yang Li-hsing was found dead in a hotel room in southern Taiwan.,"TAIPEI: The  deputy head of Taiwan defence ministry’s research and development unit  was found dead on Saturday morning in a hotel room, according to the  official Central News Agency.
Ou Yang Li-hsing, deputy head of the  military-owned National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology,  was found dead in a hotel room in southern Taiwan on Saturday morning,  CNA reported. It said authorities were looking into the cause of death.
Ou Yang was on a business trip to the southern county of Pingtung, CNA  said, adding that he had assumed the post early this year to supervise  various missile production projects.
The military-owned body is  working to more than double its yearly missile production capacity to  close to 500 this year, as the island boosts its combat power amid what  it sees as China’s growing military threat.
Taiwan blockade
Beijing’s largest-ever exercises around Taiwan have offered key clues into its plans for a gruelling blockade in the event of a war to take the self-ruled island, and revealed an increasingly emboldened Chinese military, experts said.Mobilising fighter planes, helicopters and even warships, the drills aim to simulate a blockade of Taiwan and include practising an  “attack on targets at sea”, according to state news agency Xinhua.
It is the first time Chinese exercises have taken place so close to Taiwan, with some of the drills happening less than 20 kilometres from the island’s coast.
Also unprecedented are Beijing’s drills on Taiwan’s eastern flank, a strategically vital area for supplies to the island’s military forces — as well as any potential American reinforcements. China sees Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to one day take it, by force if necessary.
A  “blockade scenario” was long speculated to be one of China’s preferred strategies were it to try and conquer the island, and this week’s drills have revealed how that might go down.
Such a besiegement would aim to prevent any entry or exit of commercial or military ships and aircraft. But it would also deny American forces stationed in the region access to the island.
The Chinese military  “obviously has all the capabilities to impose such a blockade”, Song Zhongping, an independent Chinese military commentator, said.
“We already see during the current exercises that Taiwanese fighter jets and ships absolutely cannot take off or leave their ports.”
The Chinese military fired a dozen ballistic missiles on Thursday that hit various areas around Taiwan -- with some flying over the island, Beijing’s state broadcaster CCTV said on Friday.
According to Xinhua, Beijing has mobilised more than 100 planes and more than 10 frigates and destroyers — including the J-20 stealth fighter and a Type 055 destroyer, the crown jewels of China’s air and naval forces.
But beyond the big guns, these exercises make it possible to test and sharpen the level of coordination between the various army corps mobilised: land, sea, air and rocket forces, as well as strategic support, tasked with cyber warfare.
It is also a crucial test for the recently inaugurated Eastern Theatre of Operations of the Chinese army, created in 2016 and which oversees the country’s entire eastern maritime space — and therefore Taiwan.

3,Sri Lanka seeks Chinese ship delay after Indian pressure,Yuan Wang 5 is en route from the Chinese port of Jiangyin and due in the Chinese-run Sri Lankan port of Hambantota on Thursday.,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka has asked China to indefinitely delay a visit by a ship reported by Indian media to be a spy vessel, following intense pressure by the island’s northern neighbour, official sources said on Saturday.
The Yuan Wang 5 is en route from the Chinese port of Jiangyin and due in the Chinese-run Sri Lankan port of Hambantota on Thursday, according to analytics website MarineTraffic.
It is described as a research and survey vessel, but according to Indian broadcaster CNN-News18 is a dual-use spy ship, employed for space and satellite tracking and with specific usage in intercontinental ballistic missile launches.
Indian media reports said that New Delhi was worried the vessel would be used to spy on its activities and that it had lodged a complaint with Colombo. India remains suspicious of China’s growing influence in its southern neighbour Sri Lanka.
New Delhi’s foreign ministry last week said that it will closely monitor  “any bearing on India’s security and economic interests and takes all necessary measures to safeguard them”.

4,UK boy dies after life support stopped at end of long legal battle,The case is the latest in a series that have pitted parents against Britain’s legal and healthcare systems.,"LONDON: A London hospital on Saturday withdrew life support for 12-year-old British boy Archie Battersbee after his parents lost a long, emotive and divisive legal battle.
Archie’s mother, Hollie Dance, said her son passed away just over two hours after the artificial ventilation was stopped.
“Such a beautiful little boy. He fought right until the very end,” she told reporters, sobbing, outside the Royal London Hospital.
“I’m the proudest mum in the world,” Dance said, after spending the night at his bedside with other relatives.
One of these, Ella Carter, denounced Archie’s final moments as  “barbaric”, however. She said that after his ventilation was switched off,  “he went completely blue”.
“There is absolutely nothing dignified about watching a family member or a child suffocate,” she said.
Dance found Archie unconscious at home in April with signs he had placed a cord around his neck, possibly after taking part in an online asphyxiation challenge.
The hospital trust’s chief medical officer, Alistair Chesser, said in a statement that  “Archie died after treatment was withdrawn in line with court rulings about his best interests”.
Chesser thanked the medical staff who cared for Archie, saying they  “provided high quality care with extraordinary compassion over several months in often trying and distressing circumstances”.
At the entrance to the hospital in east London, well-wishers left flowers and cards, and lit candles in the shape of the letter  “A”.
“My boy is 12, the same age as Archie, and this just puts things in perspective,” Shelley Elias, 43, said after leaving her own offerings at the site earlier on Saturday.
“I did not know what to write because there are no words that will take the pain away,” she said. A judge in June agreed with doctors that Archie was  “brain-stem dead”, allowing life support to be discontinued, but the family fought through the courts to overturn that.
Arguing that Archie could benefit from treatment in Italy or Japan, they took their case all the way to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which this week declined to intervene.
The parents also lost a last-ditch legal bid to have Archie transferred to a hospice for his final hours.
“All legal routes have been exhausted,” a spokesman for the campaign group Christian Concern, which has been supporting the family, said.
‘Charlie’s Law’
The case is the latest in a series that have pitted parents against Britain’s legal and healthcare systems.
The involvement of groups such as Christian Concern in support of desperate parents has drawn criticism for prolonging the pain of all concerned.
Such groups are often working to their own agendas, according to Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford.
“They may have different political or other views, (and) have reason to wish to tell the parents things that may not be accurate,” he said on Sky. After a highly charged battle between the hospital and his parents, 23-month-old Alfie Evans died in April 2018 when doctors in Liverpool, in northwestern England, withdrew life support.

5,"Rare flooding traps 1,000 people in Death Valley",No injuries reported but around 60 cars bogged down under several feet of debris.,"LOS ANGELES: Major flooding in California’s Death Valley on Friday stranded approximately 1,000 people, buried cars and shut down all roads into and out of the famously parched national park.
No injuries were reported, according to the National Park Service, but around 60 cars were bogged down under several feet of debris.
“Unprecedented amounts of rainfall caused substantial flooding,” the National Park Service said in a statement, adding that  “there are approximately 500 visitors and 500 staff currently unable to exit the park,” which is in Eastern California’s Mojave Desert.
The floodwaters tore up sections of paved roads and pushed dumpster containers into parked cars, causing the vehicles to collide. The rain also flooded offices and hotels, the park said. The park service added that all roads serving the park will remain off-limits until officials can determine the extent of the damage.
A total of 1.46 inches of rain fell in the park’s Furnace Creek area, almost tying the previous daily record of 1.47 inches. The average annual rainfall is less than two inches a year. Higher temperatures caused by climate change mean the atmosphere holds more moisture, unleashing more rain.
According to UN climate experts, even if the world manages to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, some regions will experience an increase in frequency, intensity and quantity of heavy rainfall. The risk of heavy precipitation episodes increases with temperature rise.

6,‘Enough!’: Exhausted Gazans under fire again,"With empty streets and drawn curtains, Gaza feels like a ghost town,","GAZA: With empty streets and drawn curtains, Gaza feels like a ghost town. Its residents — tested by repeated wars — feel like they are living the same scenes again and again.
Before Israel launched its  “pre-emptive” strikes on militants in the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian territory was enjoying a summer unlike any other in recent years.
Gaza’s beaches, long deemed too polluted with waste water for swimmers, had been declared mostly usable again, allowing Palestinians swimmers and surfers to rediscover the joys of the sea.
All that came to an abrupt halt on Friday when Israel again bombarded the territory, citing threats from Islamic Jihad militants. “We were living in peace and suddenly the bombardment began,” said 40-year-old Mohammed Hamami.
“Enough! Enough!” he exclaimed.  “Each month or each year there is a war.” There have been four conflicts since 2007 between Israel and armed groups from Gaza.
The beach promenade, one of the impoverished and overcrowded territory’s rare leisure spots, crowded less than 24 hours earlier, was desolate on Saturday.
Street vendors stayed home and cafes were closed.
Fifteen months after the last conflict between Israel and armed groups in the territory brought devastation to countless Gazans, Hamami said he was  “surprised” that Israel had attacked again. Twice in July Israeli jets had struck Gaza after what the military said was rocket and rifle fire from the territory. But this time the military said it was preparing for a week-long operation.
The Jewish state has blockaded Gaza since 2007, the year Hamas took power in the territory.
Israel’s army said its latest campaign was targeting militant sites and fighters, estimating that 15 combatants had been killed. Palestinian militants retaliated with rocket fire.
The Hamas-run health ministry has reported 13 deaths from Israeli fire including a five-year-old girl, Alaa Kaddum. Her father carried her at her funeral, with a wound on her forehead and a pink bow in her hair. More than 110 other people have been wounded, the ministry said.
For Gazans, the long night and second day of Israeli strikes stirred familiar and unwelcome emotions.
“This latest escalation brings back images of fear, anxiety, and the feeling that we are all alone,” said Dounia Ismail, a Gaza City resident. The incessant explosions and air strikes had kept her up all night, she said.
“It has become a habit for Palestinians in Gaza to prepare a survival bag, which contains a few important things, like photos, documents and some money and medicine,” in case they have to flee their homes, said Ismail.
“I hope this escalation won’t turn into a bigger conflict and I hope the Egyptian mediation will restore calm.” In Jabalia, in Gaza’s north, Fouad Farajallah inspected what remained of his home, hit by an Israeli strike on Friday. The living room had turned into a mass of sheet metal and rubble, the fan dangling from the ceiling.
“I was sitting here on the sofa, with my wife and children, and suddenly it all fell on us,” he said.
“My wife broke her hand and my son was wounded by shrapnel.” Even when silence appears to return between bombardments, something else fills the air: the buzzing of Israeli drones.

7,Armed groups clash in Libyan capital,"TRIPOLI: Clashes between armed groups erupted overnight in Tripoli, according to local media reports, the latest...","TRIPOLI: Clashes between armed groups erupted overnight in Tripoli, according to local media reports, the latest violence to hit the Libyan capital.
A journalist heard gunfire and explosions around 1am on Saturday in the city.
The fighting, with light and heavy weapons, occurred in the El Jebs district in the city’s south, media reports said.
Tensions have been rising for months in Libya as two prime ministers vie for power, raising fears of renewed conflict two years after a landmark truce ended a ruinous attempt by eastern military chief Khalifa Haftar to seize Tripoli by force.
Saturday’s clashes were between armed groups loyal to Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, head of the unity government based in Tripoli, and others following his rival Fathi Bashagha, named in February as prime minister by a parliament based in Libya’s east after he made a pact with Haftar.
The fighting ended when another group called the 444 Brigade intervened to mediate, according to Libyan media. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Bashagha has failed in his attempts to oust Dbeibah, who has repeatedly asserted he will only hand over power to an elected government. Tensions between armed groups loyal to the rival leaders have increased in recent months in Tripoli. On July 22, fighting in the heart of the city left 16 dead and about 50 wounded.
Dbeibah’s Government of National Unity was appointed as part of a United Nations-backed peace process to end more than a decade of violence in the North African country. The transitional government had a mandate to lead the country to elections last December, but they never took place due to divisions over the rules and the presence of controversial candidates.

8,Spain battles northwest wildfires,MADRID: Spanish firefighters on Saturday struggled to contain wildfires that have ravaged large tracts in the...,"MADRID: Spanish firefighters on Saturday struggled to contain wildfires that have ravaged large tracts in the northwest, as a third summer heatwave grips the country.
Firefighters were battling six blazes in Galicia that have scorched nearly 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres).
Some 700 people have been evacuated from the area around Boiro, where a blaze broke out on Thursday, according to regional officials. But no casualties have been reported so far.
“The situation remains complicated. Helicopters are not enough to control all of the homes,” the mayor of neighbouring A Pobra do Caraminal, Xose Lois Pinero, wrote on Facebook. Near the town of Verin, by the border with Portugal, authorities were managing to contain a fire that started Wednesday and is suspected to have been arson, Galicia government said.
Temperatures hit a 40.9 degrees Celsius (105.62 Fahrenheit) high on Thursday, according to the national weather agency. 
They have eased since, but were expected to remain around 35C across much of the country on Saturday. Scientists say human-induced climate change is making extreme weather events including heatwaves and droughts more frequent and more intense. They in turn increase the risk of fires, which emit climate heating greenhouse gases.
Spain has faced 366 wildfires since the start of the year, fuelled by scorching temperatures and drought conditions.

9,Iran urges ‘realistic’ US response to revive nuclear deal,DUBAI: Iran’s foreign minister called on Saturday for a  “realistic response” from the United States to ...,"DUBAI: Iran’s foreign minister called on Saturday for a  “realistic response” from the United States to Iranian proposals at indirect talks in Vienna aimed at reviving Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, state media reported.
The comments came as talks continued for a third day on Saturday with few expecting a breakthrough compromise while Tehran’s disputed uranium enrichment programme surges forward.
“Hossein Amirabdollahian... stressed the need for a realistic US response to Iran’s constructive proposals on various issues to make the deal work,” state media reported, without providing details on the proposals.
Little remains of the 2015 pact between Iran and the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, which lifted sanctions against Tehran in exchange for curbs on Iranian enrichment activity the West fears could yield atomic bombs.
In 2018, then-US President Donald Trump ditched the deal and reimposed harsh sanctions. In response, Tehran — which says its nuclear programme is for power generation and other peaceful purposes — breached the agreement in several ways including rebuilding stocks of enriched uranium.
Iranian media suggested a sticking point in the talks to revive the pact may be over Iran’s refusal to address alleged unexplained uranium traces as demanded by the UN nuclear watchdog (IAEA), with Tehran insisting that the nuclear deal had cleared its nuclear programme of alleged possible military dimensions.
In June, the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Board of Governors passed a resolution criticising Iran for failing to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. But a senior Iranian presidential aide said Tehran demanded the issue be closed before it would agree to resume compliance with the pact.
“In all of (President Ebrahim) Raisi’s telephone calls with the presidents of France, Russia and China, his firm position has been that a final agreement could be reached only when safeguards claims were resolved and closed,” state media on Saturday quoted the deputy head of Raisi’s office as saying.
The European parties to the deal on Friday urged Iran  “not to make unrealistic demands outside the scope of the JCPoA (nuclear deal), including on IAEA safeguards.
“The text is on the table. There will be no re-opening of negotiations. Iran must now decide to conclude the deal while this is still possible,” a European statement said.
Indirect talks between Tehran and Washington restarted in Vienna on Thursday with a meeting between the Islamic Republic’s chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani and European Union coordinator Enrique Mora.
Reuters, citing one Iranian and one European official, reported in June that Tehran had dropped a major stumbling block — its demand for the removal of its Revolutionary Guards from a US sanctions list.
A senior Iranian official suggested that the issue might not be a sticking point anymore, telling Reuters on Thursday:  “We have our own suggestions that will be discussed in the Vienna talks, such as lifting sanctions on the Guards gradually.”

Militiamen entered the village of Damas in the Mabendi area of Ituri’s Djugu territory at around 11 pm on Friday night and killed 22 people, according to Congolese army spokesman Lieutenant Jules Ngongo.
“We condemn this attack,” he said, adding that soldiers are currently pursuing the militants.
The Zaire militia describes itself as a self-defence group whose mission is to protect members of the Hema community against attacks from the CODECO militia representing the rival Lendu community.
The Lendu and Hema communities have a long-standing feud that led to thousands of deaths between 1999 and 2003 before intervention by a European peacekeeping force. Violence resumed in gold-rich Ituri in 2017, which has been blamed on the emergence of the CODECO.

The Democratic president,  “in an abundance of caution,” will remain in isolation until he tests negative on a second test, Dr Kevin O’Connor said in a memo released by the White House.
Biden, 79, emerged from isolation at the White House on July 27 after testing positive for Covid-19 for the first time on July 21. He tested positive again on July 30 in what O’Connor described as a  “rebound” case seen in a small percentage of people who take the antiviral drug Paxlovid.
The illness has kept Biden from traveling and doing public events, though he has appeared at meetings virtually.
