Additional Sessions Judge-II (East) Ghulam Mustafa Leghari passed the order on an application filed by family of the former lawmaker — Dua-e-Aamir and Ahmed Aamir — who had challenged the June 18 order of a judicial magistrate that allowed a citizen’s application to exhume their father’s body to ascertain the ‘actual cause of his death’.
The magistrate had observed that the cause of his death was still uncertain, which itself had raised question about either it was natural or unnatural and could only be ascertained after exhumation of the body and its examination.
Advocate Zia Awan for the applicants claimed that the citizen, Ahad, on account of his previous political rivalry with the late MNA had filed the application for exhuming the body for an autopsy.
He expressed apprehension that his clients would suffer an irreparable loss if the stay order was not granted.
The judge, without touching the merits of the magistrate’s order, suspended its operation till the next date of hearing set for Aug 11. 
He also issued notices to respondents to file their comments on the next date.
Earlier, the MNA’s family had challenged the magistrate’s decision in the Sindh High Court that had granted an interim stay against exhumation of the victim’s body.

1,People fail to see logic behind severe loadshedding in Karachi amid cool weather,Night-long outages torment children and the elderly; Muharram majalis severely affected by blackouts.,"• Nightlong outages torment children and the elderly
• Muharram majalis severely affected by blackouts
KARACHI: Residents of the metropolis spent sleepless nights and faced hardship during days because of multiple spells of loadshedding being carried out by the K-Electric for the past more than one week despite a low demand of electricity due to prevailing cool and cloudy weather. 
Sources in the power utility said that the KE was carrying out loadshedding to bridge the demand and supply gap that had been created ‘artificially’ since it was not producing electricity in accordance with its own capacity. 
They said that the company was relying on the cheap power it got from the national grid and the electricity it produced by using indigenous gas. 
Information posted by the KE on its website with regard to feeder-wise loadshedding suggest that the power utility was carrying out hours-long loadhsedding on a daily basis — both during day and night — in almost every area of the metropolis. 
However, upscale localities of the city were experiencing less loadshedding — minimum four hours — compared to those parts which had been experiencing loadshedding throughout the year. 
The sources said that this time around the KE had been carrying out loadshedding after sunset during the first 10 days of Muharram when thousands of majalis took place every day and prolonged loadshedding in the evening increased security concerns. 
“There are no areas exempted from loadshedding based on billing. The KE is carrying out up to six hours of loadshedding daily in the areas it previously claimed to be part of the exempted ones where the billing was more than 90 per cent. Nowadays, it exempts an area keeping in view the influence and power of its residents,” said a KE source, asking not to be named. 
The source added that the primary purpose behind the loadshedding was to save cost on generation to increase profitability. 
A twitter user, San’a Mir, tweeted that her area in DHA Phase I was experiencing four spells of loadshedding for total five hours in 24 hours that included two spells of one hour each after midnight. On Saturday, she tweeted: “Karachi is suffering en masse. People have to work, kids have school. And NO ONE is sleeping.”
The reply from the twitter handle of KE to Ms Mir states: “The shortfall in KE territory has increased from an average of 250 MW – 350 MW to almost 450 MW – 500 MW. Moreover, the shortfall persists round the clock making the nighttime load shed unavoidable.”

 





 
Another complained on Twitter about “unannounced loadshedding” at DHA Phase VII to which KE replied that her area was under “rationalised” loadshedding. 
When the KE twitter handle reminded a consumer that no unannounced loadshedding was being carried out in the city, journalist Naimat Khan took it to task, stating: “So scheduling load shedding justifies it? It is not a matter of days or even weeks so that people should bear with you. This is a prolonged issue of months, and aimed at pushing fed govt to force SSGC to give you cheap gas without payment of dues by KE. Simple is that.”

 





 
Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader MPA Khurram Sher Zaman tweeted: “Some areas of Karachi suffering from 12-16 hours per day power outages & load-shedding. Where is NEPRA to hold K-Electric accountable? Sadly, nowhere!”
A resident of Federal B Area Block 15 complained that his previously exempted area had been facing four spells of loadshedding including two at very odd times ie from 1am to 2am and 3am to 4am. 
A spokesman for the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen told Dawn that it was for the first time in the last over three decades that the power utility carried out loadshedding during Muharram. 
“We held several meetings before and after first Muharram with KE officials but they said due to limited power supply, increasing demand and financial issues they are not able to end loadshedding even till Ashura,” he said, adding: “Later, in some areas they have changed loadshedding time and now conducting loadshedding during day for same hours instead of night...but this is only in some sensitive areas, not all.”
The KE tweeted a generic response to almost everyone complaining about the loadshedding in their locality. It said: “Due to the ongoing power supply constraints, the shortfall persists round the clock making the nighttime load shed unavoidable. The current LS regime is the same as implement from 1st July 2022.”

2,Young man dies in ANF custody under ‘controversial circumstances’,The ANF claims the 21-year-old suspect committed suicide by hanging himself in the washroom of the lock-up.,"KARACHI: A young man held on charges of possessing drugs died in the custody of the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) in its lock-up under controversial circumstances on Saturday, officials said.
The ANF, however, claimed that the 21-year-old suspect committed suicide by hanging himself in the washroom of the lock-up in its Gulshan-i-Iqbal police station.
The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where doctors sent it to a morgue until formation of a medical board under the supervision of a judicial magistrate for a proper examination and post-mortem to ascertain the exact cause of his death.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the body of Ali Akbar was brought to the JPMC by the ANF at 9:30am. The ANF officials said he died of ‘hanging in custody’.
The body was kept at the morgue until a judicial magistrate issued directives of a custodial death board.
According to ANF officials, Ali Akbar was arrested on Aug 4 with 9.6 kilograms of hashish and a case (FIR 25/2022) was registered against him. 
On Aug 5, the ANF produced the suspect before a judicial magistrate (Malir), who remanded him in ANF custody for one day. He was taken to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for a Covid- test and other medical check-up and subsequently he was brought to the ANF police station in Gulshan-i-Iqbal.
They said that the suspect with the help of his drawstring and bedspread hanged himself in the washroom of the lock-up. A sentry found him dead at about 7:30am. He was immediately taken to a nearby private hospital on main University Road near Safari Park, but doctors referred him to the JPMC. Doctors at the health facility pronounced him dead on arrival.
The body was shifted to the mortuary of the Chhipa charity on Sharea Faisal until an inquiry was initiated under Section 176 of the criminal procedure code (inquiry by magistrate into cause of death).

3,Tragedy averted after fishermen dive into sea to salvage capsized boat,"Vessel overturned due to strong winds, high waves...","KARACHI: Some 11 fishermen, all hailing from a fishing village in Ibrahim Hyderi, saved their own lives after a boat accident by reaching the seashore at Seaview in the early hours of Saturday.  
The fishermen were on their boat named Al-Mustafa, with the registration number 17205B, at high seas when the strong winds and high waves resulted in the capsizing of the vessel.  
According to Kamal Shah of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF), realising what was happening some fishermen dived into the sea to save themselves while others who were caught unawares got trapped under the boat. “The ones who dived into the water then swam up to the overturned boat to help their friends out from under it,” said Shah.  
“Fishermen are very able and strong swimmers. They have no difficulty swimming against the tides even,” said Shah.  

Vessel overturned due to strong winds, high waves

“At first they all climbed on top of their overturned boat for a breather. Then they dived into the sea again to try and turn their boat over again. After several tries, they succeeded in righting their boat. The boat is fine but it has lost its outboard motor or engine,” he informed.  
“Thank God there was no loss of life. There is no alternative for a life,” said Shah. “But still the boat engine, which fell into the sea, sank due to its heavy weight, and lost. A new engine costs around Rs400,000 to Rs500,000 so his is a big blow to the fishermen,” he said.  
“The incident took place at around 5am and the boat was towed out to the shore with the help of another rescue boat with ropes during high tide at around 10am. It was later pulled to the beach by around 20 to 25 fishermen who reached there to help upon hearing of the incident,” Shah added.  
The PFF also aired their grievances about how lightly the safety of fishermen is taken in the country. “The fishermen saved their lives themselves. There was no one to help them or come to their rescue in the high seas, which concerns us. Even the boat which pulled Al-Mustafa near the shore was brought by our own fisherfolk so we only have our own people to thank for the safety of our own,” a PFF spokesperson added.  
“Fishing is business. Fishing helps earn revenue and foreign exchange for this country. It has been the PFF’s objective from day one to gain support for fishermen from the government, but sadly the government and government organisations associated with fishing and the fisheries have always remained unsuccessful in helping fisherfolk or help them feel more secure. They are forced to lookout for themselves or look to NGOs for support instead,” he added.  
Meanwhile, the Fishermen Cooperative Society (FCS) released the names of some eight of the fishermen involved in the incident.  
They are Rashid Suleman, Shiraz, Murtaza, Karo, Salman, Ali Akbar, Mohsin and Rafiq. According to the FCS, the captain of Al-Mustafa swan ashore to get in touch with his relatives who then arrived with more help.  
Nasir Bunairi of FCS said that the fishermen’s boat Al-Mustafa was later moved to the jetty in Ibrahim Hyderi.

5,"Thanks to vaccination, Karachi sees significant drop in Covid cases","While 13 deaths reported in city in one week, August positivity rate stands at 1.36pc.","KARACHI: At least 13 Covid-19 patients have succumbed to the infection at different hospitals in a week in the city, which has seen a significant reduction in the number of coronavirus cases over the past two months, it emerged on Saturday.
Sources said the case positivity ratio in the city had dropped from 20-25 per cent in July to 1.36pc in August.
They said nine of the 13 deaths were reported on Aug 2 — the highest single day Covid-related death toll in two months — in the city, which had earlier reported as many deaths on July 15. Four mortalities were reported on Aug 3.
“We have had eight deaths in August. All patients were above 60 years and had co-morbidities including diabetes and high blood pressure. Two patients were suffering from renal failure,” said Dr Abdul Wahid Rajput, medical superintendent of the Sindh Infectious Disease Hospital and Research Centre at Nipa.

While 13 deaths reported in city in one week, August positivity rate stands at 1.36pc

The patients, six of them residents of Karachi, had been critically ill for several days and were on ventilator, he told Dawn.
Asked about the current status of Covid-19 patients at the facility, Dr Rajput said 16 Covid-19 patients were under treatment, two of them children including a two-month-old baby.
“The other one is a five-year-old. Both children are stable. The baby seemed to have caught the infection during a hospital visit or from an infected relative as both parents have no recent history of the infection,” he explained.  
Recalling last month’s experience when the infection hit its peak in the city, Dr Rajput said the staff had no problem at all in patient management.
“The maximum number of admitted patients we had on a single day was 30. Their treatment and care wasn’t a big deal at all given our experience with the disease and patients over the past two years. Now, we are getting one to two patients on a daily basis,” he said.
The 150-bedded hospital can accommodate 48 patients in three intensive care units and 100 patients in its high dependency units.
Presently, 16 Covid patients, six in critical condition, are being treated at the facility.
Vaccination did help
On the current status of Covid cases in Karachi, Dr Saeed Khan, a professor of molecular pathology heading the Sindh Public Health Lab at the Dow University of Health Sciences, said the situation had improved across the city, though the cases were on the rise in Punjab and northern areas.
“However, the positive thing is less patient hospitalisation and reduced number of deaths, which has been achieved through vaccination,” he said.
About the new variant/s, he said there were minor changes within the Omicron sub-variant but there were no reports of any new virus or sub-variant so far.
When contacted, a health department official admitted that there were 13 deaths this month. No reply, however, was received when asked where these deaths were reported.
Karachi was the most affected part of the province since the start of the sixth Covid wave in June with 340 positive cases in a week, raising the positivity rate to 10.69pc.
Experts held a new sub-variant of Omicron (BA.5), which had already been reported in other countries and Pakistan, responsible for the fast spread of the disease.
A vast majority of Covid patients, they said, didn’t report at health facilities at all and safely recovered at home.

“We have released the lizards in their habitat in the Kirthar National Park on Saturday morning. They were being sold near a Dawakhana that apparently was used to make illicit drugs from reptiles,” Inspector Aijaz Noodani told Dawn.
A man, identified as Abdul Ghaffar, had been arrested while investigation into the case was being carried out, he said. “The snakes, two cobras and as many sand boas, would be released into their habitat soon.”
According to wildlife experts, both Sindh and Balochistan have remained hotspots for reptiles in the country. Balochistan has remained safe from illegal trapping and poaching and boasts a large number of reptile species, some of which are endemic.


Spiny tailed lizards in the custody of the wildlife department.

 
In Sindh, Nagarparkar, Mithi and Umerkot are hotspots for snakes, besides Sanghar, Shikarpur and Nawabshah.
Experts said that the unchecked operation of jogis, particularly in the interior of Sindh was one of the major reasons behind the declining strength of many snake species in the province, besides the loss of habitat and smuggling.
The lizards are hunted for their skins and oil, made from visceral fat. The ‘hakims’ are also held responsible for the falling reptilian population as they recommend different reptilian species and their parts as a cure for several ailments.
“For some two years now, we have been taking strict action against traders involved in illicit reptile trade and the population of spiny tailed lizards is now getting stabilised in their habits across the province,” said Sindh Wildlife Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar.
These lizards, he pointed out, performed an extremely important role that no fertilizer could play in soil fertility.
“Unlike other carnivore lizards, they are herbivorous. They build a deep network of burrows which allow oxygen to pass through the soil, enhancing soil fertility,” he explained.

7,PTI sees plot behind marking causeway land for dumping garbage,KARACHI: Former federal minister and Sindh president of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Ali Zaidi on ...,"KARACHI: Former federal minister and Sindh president of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Ali Zaidi on Saturday accused “influential individuals” of hatching a plan in connivance with the Sindh government to encroach land over Korangi causeway.
Speaking at a press conference here, he said the Korangi causeway was badly damaged in the recent rains but instead of its repair and rehabilitation, the Sindh government had marked it as a dumping point of all garbage being collected from different parts of the city.
“Area people have told us that this garbage is being used for land filling and then in the second step it’s highly suspected that this site would be encroached upon for commercial purpose,” he said. 
“Korangi causeway was never used as a dumping point but you would see heaps of garbage. This is not just incompetence of the PPP government but also their insensitive approach as it never owns Karachi and feels the pain for the people of this city,” he said.
He warned that the people of Karachi would not see any improvement in the civic infrastructure during the upcoming spell of monsoon rains and the city was feared to undergo another phase of flooding and damage to life and property.
“After back-to-back spells of heavy rains in Karachi and other Sindh cities, the provincial government has badly failed in keeping its words about resolving the rain-related problems. After the passage of several days, the sewerage system damage by the downpour has not been fixed in majority of the Karachi areas,” said Mr Zaidi.

Special Gender Based Violence Court (East) Judge Ilyas noted that Judicial Magistrate-XXVI (East) Aftab Ahmed Bughio on Aug 1 while exercising his administrative powers had dismissed the investigating officer’s application seeking permission to shift the 15-year-old girl from the shelter home to thae hospital for her medical examination to ascertain whether or not she was subjected to any sexual assault during the period she spent with her purported husband following her alleged illegal marriage.
He observed that the applicant’s counsel claimed that the medical examination of the victim was the basic requirement in accordance with Section 164-A and provisions of the Prevention of Trafficking in Person Rules, 2020.
The judge observed that it came on record that the investigation of the said case was still in progress and it was admitted position that the charge sheet had not been submitted by the IO.
He said the opinion of the police had got no binding effect upon courts, adding that the judicial magistrate had ample powers to take cognizance at the time of submission of the charge sheet under Section 190 of the criminal procedure code.
He noted that the judicial magistrate had dismissed the IO’s plea in the interest of the victim, as there was an apprehension that by conducting her medical examination, it would achieve nothing but embarrassment from the society.
He further said any order passed by the judicial magistrate during the course of enquiry would be termed as administrative, executive or ministerial order, adding that the Aug 1 order was not passed by the magistrate during criminal proceedings, hence the same be termed as administrative.
IO allowed one-week to submit challan
In the meanwhile, JM Bughio allowed one-week time to the IO, DSP Saeed Rind, to conclude the investigation into the case pertaining to alleged abduction of the underage girl from Karachi and her illegal marriage in Punjab.
The magistrate also told the IO to submit the final charge sheet on the next date and adjourned the hearing.
Contrary to its previous claim that the case pertaining to the teenager’s kidnapping and child marriage was false, police had admitted before a sessions’ court on July 16 that the victim was not only kidnapped from Karachi but also shifted to Lahore.

9,"Friends, admirers remember journalist Akhtar Balouch",KARACHI: A considerable number of speakers from the fields of journalism and social work on Friday evening went down...,"KARACHI: A considerable number of speakers from the fields of journalism and social work on Friday evening went down memory lane at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) to share their memories of journalist, rights activist and researcher Akhtar Balouch, who passed away on July 31.
Moderating the event, Dr Tauseef Ahmed Khan said Balouch adhered to his narrative of secularism and democracy until he breathed his last. His death is untimely.
Journalist Saeed Jan Baloch recalled the last few days of the late journalist’s life from the time when he had accompanied him to the Arts Council on July 28 where an event in honour of a visiting poet was held. Hours later, Balouch started to feel unwell — he had a fever. Later he called up Saeed Jan who took him to a clinic. After running some tests it turned out that his blood pressure was on the lower side. On the night of July 30, Balouch’s son phoned Saeed Jan to tell him that his father was no more.
Secretary General of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) Harris Khalique said his association with Balouch had spanned over 35 years. He first met him in Hyderabad where his uncle lived and where he had come from Mirpurkhas. They used to meet on a daily basis. They also had similar political and ideological views. 
“He was a lively and witty person. Usually those who work for political or human rights become bitter, which is to do with the ‘two steps forward and one step back’ movement of society. That wasn’t the case with Balouch, which is rare. He used to constantly smile and crack jokes. The younger generation could learn that from him — if your hope and dreams are big, then it can save you from getting into the clutches of bitterness.”
Labour Minister Saeed Ghani said although he couldn’t claim that he knew Balouch very well, ever since he joined politics he had an association with the KPC and its journalists — Balouch was one of them. “Since I do my politics in Karachi, there were many things related to the city for which I used to seek guidance from Balouch. I never saw despondency on his face. When I heard the news of his death, I couldn’t believe it. I think it’s a great loss to journalism.”
Photographer Akhtar Soomro said he had known Balouch for four decades. When the late journalist shifted to Karachi and started coming to the press club with regularity, their relationship progressed. Their common interests were Karachi and its old colonial buildings. Then Balouch began writing a blog for Dawn.com. “We used to explore the things in the city which the citizens didn’t know about. In that pursuit we moved around Karachi on a motorbike.” 
In that context, Soomro narrated a story about how Balouch tried to discover where the actual Gurumandir was. He also told the audience — which had filled the KPC hall in no time and extra chairs had to be brought for the guests — how confusion was caused when initially Balouch came to the KPC because both Soomro and Balouch used to have the same surname, Husain.
Journalist Saeed Sarbazi talked about the role KPC played in Balouch’s life. He said it was because of the club that he was able to undertake the kind of research that he became known for.
Former HRCP chairperson Zohra Yusuf said before being recognised as a journalist, Balouch was known all over Sindh as a rights activist. She also mentioned the fact that during annual general meetings of the commission, Balouch and Rashid Rahman used to entertain the attendees.
Naimatullah Bukhari, Arbab Chandio, Mahesh Kumar, Imtiaz Faran, Fazil Jamili and Karan Singh, among others, also spoke.

10,Ajmerion ka tazia completes 145 years today,HYDERABAD: Family of elderly Ghous Mohammad Arain carries forward tradition for 144 years by staging Ajmerion ka...,"


 
HYDERABAD: Family of elderly Ghous Mohammad Arain carries forward tradition for 144 years by staging Ajmerion ka tazia on 8th of Muharram (tonight) every year in Hyderabad. It will be 145th year of this custom ever-since his family members migrated to this part of subcontinent after its Partition in 1947.
“Our elders used to bring it in pre-partition city of Ajmer and its permit was issued in the name of Lal Bux, son of Pir Bux. The very permit is issued by the Hyderabad police to date since the Partition,” says Ghous Mohammad Arain. Arain is grandson of Lal Bux.
Ajmerion ka tazia is one of oldest events held to mark the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain and his companions. This tazia is brought out every year without fail barring the year 1947 when Pakistan was born, according to Ghous. “Our elders are associated with it for generations and they still bring it out in Ajmer, too”, adds bespectacled Ghous.
“We didn’t have licence at that time as it remained in India and our elder went to India to obtain and submitted it to the authorities here [in Hyderabad],” adds 68-year-old Ghous. He is as energetic as ever.  Lal Bux had gone to India to get the licence from his uncle, Maula Bux.
The 13ft wooden tazia has been placed at Market Tower. People have started visiting it to pay their respect. Its procession is to be taken out on the night intervening 8th and 9th of Muharram. 
“Those associated with this procession use traditional drums [dhol] and taashay [small versions of drum],” says Aijaz, a nephew of Ghous who now builds the tazia. Naubat is the typical instrument used in procession by his family members, adds Ghous, It is made of buffalo’s skin tightly fixed over a bowl shaped iron structure,” he said. “We take it to the Phulelli canal to drop its parts at the end of the procession,”, he said. 
“Ajmeriyon ka tazia is indeed the oldest one in Hyderabad attracting a large crowd on the 8th of Muharram. People dressed in Arabic attire used to bring a camel cart which depicts scene of the Karbala tragedy,” recalls Saeed Akhtar, a retired schoolteacher who himself is associated with tazia making for 47 years.

11,Peoples Bus Service set to be launched in Larkana district,LARKANA: All is set to launch the Peoples Bus Service in Larkana district with a fleet of 16 buses that arrived here...,"LARKANA: All is set to launch the Peoples Bus Service in Larkana district with a fleet of 16 buses that arrived here on Saturday. 
Larkana Commissioner Ghanwar Ali Leghari in a communication with the provincial transport and mass transit secretary had a cursory eye on the transport facilities in the district and proposed three routes for the service, sources said. 
These routes would effectively connect all talukas of the district. The routes are -- Larkana to Ratodero via Dhamrah and Banguldero; Larkana to Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto via Dodai, Chuharpur, Mahotta, Kehar and Naudero; and Larkana to Mohenjo Daro via Otha Chowk, Bakrani, Arija and Airport.
It is learnt that the commissioner had on August 5 forwarded a concept note and proposal to the transport secretary for approval. 
Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who holds the portfolio of foreign minister, had initially intended to inaugurate the bus service as he had made such promise to the people of his constituency on June 21. However, due to his preoccupations including local government elections and foreign visits, he could not make himself available for the proposed ceremony. 
On Friday (August 5), PPP chairman’s political secretary Jamil Soomro, along with the deputy commissioner and notables representing different strata of society, took a round by the bus for a trial ride within the city.
The objective for launching this project is to provide a comfortable, cost-effective and prompt transport service to around 1.56 million people of Larkana district. The city of Larkana is the fourth most populous in Sindh. Around 10,000 to 12,000 people from different towns and villages commute between different places within the district every day but they do not have any such systemic transport facility available to them. 
The existing transport system even in Larkana city is poor while the city continues to expand in all directions. 
The three routes of the new bus service not only cover many cities and towns, but also offer a comfortable and prompt transport facility to local as well as foreign tourists intending to visit the world heritage site of Mohenjo Daro. 
The service would prove to be the best road communication connectivity for its beneficiaries. 
According to the sources, this service is very likely to be started soon after the Ashura.

The participants discussed  the prevailing conditions with reference to agriculture sector and proposed fixing rate of DAP (Di-ammonium phosphate) fertiliser at Rs8,000 per bag, along with ensuring importing 50 million bags for at least one year. At least 130 million bags of urea fertilisers should be prepared in the country, and its rate per bag should be fixed at Rs2100, they said. 
The chamber demanded increasing gas supplies to the fertilizer factories with three times increase in its tariff. It also called for tightening import policy for pesticides and import tax should be deducted in Karachi at the time of import.
The chamber of was confident that by taking the proposed measures the country would not only double the agriculture produce, but also turn self-sufficient.
