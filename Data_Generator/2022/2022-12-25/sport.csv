0,Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup likely to be two-horse battle at KRC,The contest on Sunday has two favourites — bay horse Royal Ransom and filly Queen of Spades.,"KARACHI: The Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup, which is the showpiece event of the Karachi Race Club (KRC), appears to be a two-horse race between bay horse Royal Ransom and filly Queen of Spades when it takes place in the winter Gymkhana race meeting here at the Karachi Racecourse on Sunday.
The meeting marks the culmination of the racing calendar.
A full house of equine lovers is expected to turn up and cheer their favourite horses to commemorate the birth anniversary of Father of the Nation.
A healthy 10-race card has been drawn for the day which includes five cup races. Unlike past practice, no horse from the Lahore Race Club (LRC) will be seen in action in the blue-ribbon event this year. Similarly, top riders, owners and trainers have also not arrived for the event.
It is pertinent to mention that a horse Raksh had come to the metropolis last month to compete in the Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup but returned after featuring in the Shah Mardan Shah Pir Pagara Memorial Cup where the colt finished third.
A fierce battle is expected between 2020 Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup winner Royal Ransom — who was placed third last year — and Queen of Spades in the prized race being run over 10 furlongs.
Endurance and tactful handling of the horses by riders matters most in the handicap race for three-year-old and above thorough-bred and half-bred contestants.
Royal Ransom had only one run during the entire year in the Shah Mardan Shah Pir Pagara Memorial Cup where he finished off the frame while Queen of Spades is on course to make it three on the trot.
Chestnut horse Thunder Star has the ability to bring an element of surprise by overcoming five other aspirants.
The winner of the prestigious cup will fetch Rs770,000 out of a total stake of approximately Rs3.3 million that has been allocated for the meeting.
With a hat-trick already under her belt, filly Queens Pride looks poised to clinch the 2000 Guineas of Pakistan while overcoming the challenge in a small field of four horses in the competition contested over a mile.
Colt Sand Man looks fancied to annex the Nursery Cup being run over six furlongs. He is pitted alongside seven acceptors.
The X-MAS Cup is likely to end in a blaze of glory for bay horse Churchill. The race that will go over six furlongs has a field of seven horses.
Mare Heer seems to be the best bet in the M. Rasheed Jung Memorial Cup being run over five furlongs. She is expected to thwart the challenge from chestnut mare Sweet Golden to emerge as Champion Horse of the Year. Both the horses are tied with six wins apiece.
Dark bay horse Safeer Love, bay horse Raging Comet, colt Al Sabah, bay horse Cracks Man and filly Angel Love are expected to dominate the other five races of the card.
The first race starts at 11:30am.

5,Boxing chiefs blast ‘persecution’ in Olympics future row,PARIS: Boxing chiefs claimed on Friday they are victims of  “persecution” and  “extortion” as their sport...,"PARIS: Boxing chiefs claimed on Friday they are victims of  “persecution” and  “extortion” as their sport faces being axed from the Olympic programme.
Olympic bosses upheld a ban on the International Boxing Association (IBA) earlier this month, insisting that the  “drastic change of culture” requested in order to lift a suspension had not been implemented.
The IBA was suspended by the International Olympic Committee in 2019 for multiple corruption scandals, meaning boxing risks disappearing as an Olympic sport from the Paris Games in 2024.
Boxing only went ahead in the Covid-delayed Tokyo Olympics after the IOC stepped in to ensure the qualification criteria.
However, the IBA, whose president is Umar Kremlev of Russia, blasted their critics on Friday.
“The Olympic Games are a global sporting asset that cannot be a tool of extortion of the International Sports Federations for purely political reasons,” the IBA said in a statement.
The IBA has also come under fire for its governance, financial transparency and sustainability. Their major backer has been Russian energy giant Gazprom in a deal worth a reported $50 million.
“It is clear that the persecution of IBA athletes will continue until ultimate control of boxing and its leadership has been achieved,” added the IBA statement.
“The discrimination against you [the athletes] and IBA’s leadership and partners based on citizenship, directly contradicts the Olympic Charter, and only highlights the issue of athletes and sport being manipulated for geopolitical purposes.”
It added:  “With that said, with the threat of boxing being removed from the Paris 2024 programme, the IBA will continue to reach out to the senior leadership of the IOC to work towards a de-escalation of this current development and with a view to LA 2028.”

8,Afridi to head Pakistan’s interim selection committee,LAHORE: Former captain Shahid Afridi has been appointed as the interim chair of men’s national team selection...,"LAHORE: Former captain Shahid Afridi has been appointed as the interim chair of men’s national team selection committee, which will have former internationals Abdul Razzaq and Rao Iftikhar Anjum as members, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Saturday. 
The PCB underwent a major shake-up on Thursday when a 14-member management committee took over after Ramiz Raja was sacked as chairman. 
Najam Sethi, the chairman of the management committee appointed by the government to form a new governing board within four months, dissolved the previous committee that was headed by chief selector Mohammad Wasim before appointing Afridi. 
Former Test player Haroon Rasheed, one of 14 members in the new interim management committee, was named as convenor of the selection committee. 
Wasim, a former Pakistan middle-order batter, was appointed in 2020 and was expected to stay until next year’s 50-over World Cup in India. He was sacked, following a year in which Pakistan were beaten in the finals of the Twenty20 World Cup and the Asia Cup, before their 3-0 whitewash to England in a home Test series. 
Afridi’s appointment comes with Pakistan currently involved in a two-match Test series against New Zealand with the first match in Karachi starting from Monday. 
Sethi welcomed Afridi as head of the selection panel and hoped the committee “will make brave and bold decisions that will help us produce a strong and competitive side in the series against New Zealand.” 
In a career remembered for his hard-hitting batting, Afridi retired from international cricket in 2017 after playing more than 500 international games across all formats after his 1996 debut. 
The flamboyant all-rounder scored 11,196 runs and took 541 wickets with his leg-spin bowling in his 27 Tests, 398 ODIs and 99 Twenty20s. He also captained the team in 83 international games. He was a member of the team which won the 2009 T20 World Cup in England. 
“I feel honoured to have been assigned this responsibility,” Afridi said in a statement. “We need to get back to our winning ways and I have no doubts that through meritocratic and strategic selection decisions, we will help the national side to perform strongly in the series against New Zealand and reclaim the confidence of our fans.” 
TRIO ADDED TO TEST SQUAD 
Pakistan had already announced a 16-strong squad for the New Zealand series but on Saturday evening, Afridi took the first decision in his new role by adding three players to the team including pacers Mir Hamza and Shahnawaz Dahani and off-spinner Sajid Khan. 
Hamza’s only previous Test appearance came in 2018 against Australia while Dahani is uncapped at this level. Sajid played his seventh and last Test against Australia earlier this year. 
The PCB said that Afridi had chaired a meeting of the selection committee which saw captain Babar Azam join via a video link. 
“We had a good discussion on the squad and agreed we needed to strengthen our bowling department to give ourselves the best chance of taking 20 wickets in a match,” Afridi said in a statement. 
“I am confident the inclusion of three additional bowling resources will give Babar Azam more options to field the best available squad for the first Test.” 
Revised squad: Babar Azam (captain), Abdullah Shafique, Abrar Ahmed, Hasan Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Kamran Ghulam, Mir Hamza, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Moham­mad Wasim Jnr, Naseem Shah, Noman Ali, Sajid Khan, Salman Ali Agha, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Saud Shakeel, Shahnawaz Dahani, Shan Masood and Zahid Mehmood.

The PCB said that the poor conditions, which have already disrupted flight operations, could potentially result in the loss of playing hours.
The change in schedule means the whole series, which includes two Tests and three ODIs, will now be held in Karachi. The first Test is set to begin on Monday.
The second Test will begin on Jan 2 after that contest and the three ODIs were brought forward by a day, the statement added.

10,Gritty Saud glitters amid Pakistan’s Test struggles,"The 27-year-old Karachi-born player scored four half-centuries against England, boosting the team's morale.","KARACHI: Saud Shakeel was thrown at the deep end as soon as he made his way into the Pakistan Test squad. Against an England side riding high on “Bazball” — their ultra-aggressive style playing Test cricket — Saud responded with grace and maturity to show he belonged in the Test arena. Although Pakistan were whitewashed for the first-ever time in a Test series at home, Saud was the one inspiring hope; taking Pakistan close in two of the three games.  
The 27-year-old, bred and born in the chaotic streets of Karachi, has brought with him to the Pakistan squad grit, composure and reliability. He’s living his childhood dream — the pursuit of which began at the famed UBL Sports Academy and a lot of hard work and patience was needed to make it come true. 
Saud scored four half-centuries against England — two of which came in the fourth innings and brought Pakistan close to victories before batting collapses let them down. The performances have seen Saud become one of the key members of Pakistan’s batting lineup, but for him, that’s the bare minimum. 
“It doesn’t matter if you are playing your first match for Pakistan or the 100th, when you play for your country, it is a given that you are an important member of the team and you are required to perform,” he told Dawn in an interview on Saturday. “We are professional players and it is important for us to perform, everyone has their roles and responsibilities and I tried my level best to take us towards wins and finish the matches but couldn’t do it, unfortunately.”  
In the first Test against England in Rawalpindi, Saud arrived at the crease with Pakistan at 25-2 in pursuit of a 343-run target with more than a day to play. He stitched up a 64-run partnership with Imam-ul-Haq and then an 87-run stand for the fifth wicket with Mohammad Rizwan before getting caught at short-cover for 76.

In Multan, Saud fell victim to a poor decision by third umpire Joel Wilson to be ruled caught behind off Mark Wood after scoring a brilliant 94 to bring Pakistan back into the game after they were reeling at 67-2 in their chase of 355. 
On both occasions, Saud’s wickets triggered Pakistan’s eventual falls that led to 74 and 27-run defeats. 
“The fourth innings in Test cricket is considered difficult and it actually is as well,” he said. “We were chasing targets on both occasions and lost back-to-back wickets, including those of mine and the players who followed. When you are chasing big targets, you have to play well from the very start till the end to be successful.”  
The southpaw had a century in his sights in Multan and a few more runs for Pakistan would have seen a whole different story unfold. “My dismissal in Multan was a bit controversial too,” he rued. “Had I made 15-20 more runs, England would have panicked and would have experimented things which might have given us more chances to score runs. I’d say due to small mistakes we were whitewashed, had we not made those mistakes, it would have been different.” 
CAUGHT OFF GUARD BY ‘BAZBALL’ 
Saud believes one of the reasons behind England’s historic series win in Pakistan was how they started it. Led by an attack-minded captain in the form of Ben Stokes, the visitors plundered more than 500 runs on the first day of the opening Test.  
The ruthless onslaught on the Pakistan bowling line-up — which included three debutants — was something Saud thought hurt Pakistan’s confidence and England ensured they kept the upper hand throughout the remaining part of the series. 
“The way they started the series, scoring 500 on the first day, we weren’t expecting that,” Saud revealed. “I can’t speak on behalf of the whole team but personally, I wasn’t expecting that they would attack this way. When a team attacks like that, it’s obvious for the other team’s confidence to go down a bit. They got an upper hand at the start and they kept carrying it forward.”  
Saud praised Stokes’ captaincy and noted the all-rounder’s field placements were such that trapped the Pakistan batters by allowing them to play their shots freely. 
“When they attacked then we also countered them by scoring quick runs but that required us to play over the top or for example play more sweep shots,” he said. “They ensured they didn’t leak too many runs but tested us with field settings and invited us to use our skill to hit through and over the fielders. We were successful in doing that at some points but also made mistakes.”  
‘BABAR A GOOD CAPTAIN’ 
While Stokes was commended for his shrewd captaincy, his Pakistan counterpart Babar came under heavy criticism during the England series.  
The batter, who was appointed as Pakistan’s Test captain in late 2020, was called out for being timid and defensive with his decisions. 
Saud said he was baffled at the criticism over Babar and believed the 27-year-old was leading Pakistan at a time when they are without their best players due to injuries. 
“I don’t understand why people criticise Babar,” Saud said. “He is a good captain and whatever decision he takes has a thought behind it. Most of the times he looks to attack and he has never asked us to have a defensive approach. There were six debutants and our bowling unit was quite inexperienced and England therefore had an edge. It’s not that easy for Babar as well when you have a young bowling line-up and he has to take his time to understand his bowlers and that applies vice versa as well.” 
Following the drubbing against England, Paki­stan are set to play two Tests against New Zealand in Karachi, the first of which starts on Monday. Saud hopes to deliver again for Pakistan but this time, he’s eager to end up on the winning side.

11,Warner fires shot at CA over leadership appeal,The opener accused Cricket Australia of a lack of support during his appeal against lifetime leadership ban on him.,"MELBOURNE: Veteran David Warner accused Cricket Australia (CA) on Saturday of a lack of support in his appeal against a lifetime leadership ban and revealed he struggled mentally during the recent series against the West Indies.
The dynamic opener and former Test vice-captain was banned from any leadership role over his part in the Cape Town ball-tampering affair in 2018.
He launched a bid to overturn the sanction in Febru­ary but gave up the fight on the eve of the second Test against the West Indies in Adelaide this month.
Warner was furious that the process had dragged on so long and that an independent review panel wan­t­ed to make the hearing public, which he said would be traumatic for his young family.
The 36-year-old, who will play his 100th Test in the Boxing Day clash against South Africa in Melbourne, said it left him struggling mentally leading into the first Test against the Caribbean team in Perth, where he scored 5 and 48.
“My mental health probably wasn’t where I needed to be at, to be 100 per cent — and that was challenging at the time,” he told reporters in Melbourne.
“If I had my way, we would have had that (the review) all sorted.
“From the CA point of view, I didn’t really have any support,” he added.
“My teammates and the staff in our team were absolutely amazing, and my family and friends, so they really got me through that period.” Warner, who was also slapped with a one-year playing suspension over the so-called “Sand­paper-gate” scandal, said he could not understand why the process had taken 11 months.
“We reached out in February, so we have no idea how it went on this far, and only CA can answer that. They’ll probably give you the same thing they give everyone else — they won’t really give an answer,” he said.
Despite struggling mentally, Warner said he never considered pulling out of the West Indies series and insis­ted he was in a much better space now and determined to snap a recent run drought.
“Yeah my back’s up against the wall, but it’s in my DNA to keep being competitive, come out here with a smile on my face and take on whatever opposition we’re going to face,” said the Australian, who has not scored a Test century since January 2020.

12,BD bowlers rattle India to leave Dhaka Test in the balance,"Spinners Mehdy Hasan, Shakib Al Hasan reduced India to 45-4 at stumps with 100 left to chase, leaving match hanging in balance.","DHAKA: Bangladesh fought their way into what earlier appeared a lost cause on Saturday, knocking over four Indian wickets to leave the visitors teetering after Liton Das compiled a gritty half-century on the third day of the second Test here at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium.
The Bangladesh bowlers were given 145 runs to defend after Liton’s steely 73 and a wagging tail steered the hosts to 231 all out.
Despite the subpar score, spinners Mehidy Hasan and Shakib Al Hasan rose to the challenge, reducing India to 45-4 at stumps with 100 still left to chase, leaving the match unexpectedly hanging in the balance.
Mehidy claimed three wickets after Shakib’s initial breakthrough, removing Cheteshwar Pujara (six), Shubman Gill (seven) and Virat Kohli (one). Shakib started the slide with the wicket of captain KL Rahul for two.
Axar Patel survived the day to stay unbeaten on 26 alongside nightwatchman Jaydev Unadkat (three), with first-innings heroes Rishabh Pant and Shreyas Iyer yet to come in.
Liton said after the close of play that Bangladesh could keep India under pressure and eke out a win with early wickets on Sunday.
“It is possible to win if we can take one or two more wickets in the early morning,” he said.
“Rishabh and Iyer are yet to come, they are of course good players, but as I said if we can take one or two more wickets they will remain under pressure.”
For India, building a partnership remains vital.
“I feel we should not overthink that four wickets have gone. If one of our batsmen get set, there won’t be much pressure on us,” fast bowler Mohammed Siraj said.
Axar had earlier downed three Bangladesh batters and all of India’s bowlers were among the wickets.
But Liton rode his luck in an innings where he was dropped twice by Kohli — first off Axar and then Ravichandran Ashwin — to score what could be 73 vital runs.
There was little support for him on the other end after opener Zakir Hasan (51) fell soon after lunch until wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan joined him at the crease and the pair compiled an aggressive 46-run stand.
That stand was broken by Axar when he drew Nurul out of his crease to set up an easy stumping for Pant.
Liton then added another brisk 60 runs alongside Taskin Ahmed (31 not out) before he was bowled by a Siraj delivery that nipped back in and found the gap between bat and pad.
Even with those small pockets of resistance, India looked to be in complete control of the match, picking up regular wickets with all their bowlers getting a part of the spoils.
Ashwin had Najmul Hossain trapped leg-before for five in the second over of the day before Siraj removed Bangladesh’s first-innings top-scorer Mominul Haque for the same score.
Unadkat then got skipper Shakib (13) to spoon a length delivery to Gill at cover in his first over of the day.
With the hosts struggling, Axar added to their misery on the stroke of lunch, trapping the experienced Mushfiqur Rahim lbw for nine.
He added two more to his tally after the break, getting Mehidy lbw for nought before dismissing Nurul for 31.
Siraj, Ashwin and a run-out accounted for the final three wickets.
The Bangladesh bowlers had given their side a glimmer of hope in Friday’s final session, restricting India’s lead to 87 runs just when the visitors looked like they might amass a mammoth score.
Pant and Iyer were running rampant, with both crossing fifty at rapid pace, ending at 93 and 87, respectively, but Bangladesh knocked over the last six Indian wickets for 61 runs to restrict India to 314.
India won the first Test of the two-match series by 188 runs in Chittagong.
