SUVA: Former military commander Sitiveni Rabuka was on Saturday confirmed as Fiji’s prime minister, after accusing the outgoing government of stoking  “fear and chaos” to derail his return to power.
Rabuka replaces the imposing Frank Bainimarama, who toppled the government in a 2006 coup and became prime minister a year later. The 74-year-old Rabuka said he felt  “humbled” as he made his way out of parliament to be sworn in by the country’s president.
The two-time coup leader and former prime minister — nicknamed  “Rambo” — narrowly triumphed over Bainimarama by 28 votes to 27 in a secret ballot held in parliament, speaker Naiqama Lalabalavu announced. A smiling Bainimarama appeared to accept defeat as he told reporters after the vote:  “This is democracy”.
A chorus of cars honked in celebration as they drove past the parliamentary building in the capital Suva. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern congratulated Rabuka in a statement.
“We strongly value Fiji as a close friend and partner as we progress our shared priorities for the region,” she said. Fiji is one of the most populous and prosperous Pacific island nations, and has grown closer to China under Bainimarama.
Rabuka has signalled a willingness to shift away from Beijing in favour of traditional allies Australia and New Zealand. The military had been deployed on the streets of Suva as Rabuka and Bainimarama raced to cobble together a coalition government following a deadlocked general election.
Citing unsubstantiated reports of ethnic violence, Bainimarama said the military was needed to maintain  “law and order”.
But Rabuka — who served as prime minister between 1992 and 1999 — said the government was  “sowing fear and chaos” and  “trying to set the nation alight along racial lines”.
Many Fijians feared the government’s claims of ethnic violence — and the subsequent military deployment — were a pretext for a  “creeping coup” designed to keep Rabuka in opposition.
While not an outright autocrat, Bainimarama’s government had frequently used the legal system to sideline opponents, silence critics and muzzle the media. Police last week summoned Rabuka for questioning after he asked the military to step in and help resolve alleged  “anomalies” in preliminary election results.
“The way this government has operated, we’ve been talking about a climate of fear,” he said at the time.
“This is how they instil that fear.” Rabuka led two military coups in 1987, which aimed to increase the political influence of Indigenous Fijians, who make up about 60 percent of the country’s 900,000 population.
For this reason Rabuka has long been viewed with suspicion by the country’s sizable ethnic Indian minority, who were further marginalised in the aftermath. Incoming deputy prime minister Biman Prasad, a close political ally, has helped to soften Rabuka’s image.

1,Twitter restores suicide prevention feature,The feature places a banner at the top of search results for certain topics and lists contacts for support organisations.,"NEW YORK: Twitter Inc restored a feature that promoted suicide prevention hotlines and other safety resources to users looking up certain content, after coming under pressure from some users and consumer safety groups over its removal.
A news agency reported on Friday that the feature was taken down a few days ago, citing two people familiar with the matter, who said the removal was ordered by the social media platform’s owner Elon Musk. After the publication of the story, Twitter's head of trust and safety Ella Irwin confirmed the removal and called it temporary. “We have been fixing and revamping our prompts. They were just temporarily removed while we do that,” Irwin said in an email. “We expect to have them back up next week,” she said.
About 15 hours after the initial report, Musk — who did not initially respond to requests for comment — tweeted, “False, it is still there.” In response to criticism by Twitter users, he also tweeted, “Twitter doesn’t prevent suicide.” The feature, known as #ThereIsHelp, placed a banner at the top of search results for certain topics. It listed contacts for support organisations in many countries related to mental health, HIV, vaccines, child sexual exploitation, Covid-19, gender-based violence, natural disasters and freedom of expression.

 





 
Its elimination had led some consumer safety groups and Twitter users to express concerns about the well-being of vulnerable users of the platform.
In part due to pressure from consumer safety groups, internet services — including Twitter, Alphabet’s Google and Meta’s Facebook — have for years tried to direct users to well-known resource providers such as government hotlines when they suspect someone may be in danger of harming themselves or others.
In her email, Twitter’s Irwin said, “Google does really well with these in their search results and (we) are actually mirroring some of their approach with the changes we are making.” She added, “We know these prompts are useful in many cases and just want to make sure they are functioning properly and continue to be relevant.” Eirliani Abdul Rahman, who had been on a recently dissolved Twitter content advisory group, said the disappearance of #ThereIsHelp was “extremely disconcerting and profoundly disturbing.”

2,Turkish court releases journalist held under ‘disinformation’ law,"Sinan Aygul had tweeted last week about a 14-year-old girl allegedly having been abused by suspects, who included policemen.","ANKARA: A Turkish court ordered the release of a journalist held on remand under the country’s new disinformation law after his lawyer objected to his detention, he said.
Sinan Aygul became the first person to be jailed pending trial under the law — approved by parliament two months ago — that the government says is aimed at protecting the public but which critics say could be abused to stifle dissent.
Aygul, a journalist in the Kurdish-majority Bitlis province, wrote on Twitter last week that a 14-year-old girl had allegedly been sexually abused by suspects including police and soldiers.

He retracted the posts and apologised for writing them without confirming the story with authorities but was later arrested. Aygul said in a video posted to Twitter late on Friday that he was released after his lawyer filed an objection to the detention order.
“I am free again after 10 days of captivity,” he said in the video. “I hope neither I nor any of my journalist colleagues has to experience such a situation.” The law carries a jail sentence of up to three years for anyone who spreads false or misleading information.

3,Russian strike kills at least 10 in Kherson,Another 58 are left wounded in the attack condemned by Kyiv as wanton killing for pleasure.,"

KYIV: A Russian strike on Ukraine’s recently recaptured city of Kherson killed at least 10 people, wounded another 58 and left bloodied corpses on the road, authorities said, in what Kyiv condemned as wanton killing for pleasure.
Fresh from a trip to the United States seeking weapons to resist the 10-month Russian invasion, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy published photos showing streets strewn with burning cars, smashed windows and bodies.
“Social networks will most likely mark these photos as ‘sensitive content’. But this is not sensitive content it is the real life of Ukraine and Ukrainians,” he wrote.
“These are not military facilities [...] It is terror, it is killing for the sake of intimidation and pleasure.”  Kherson regional governor Yaroslav Yanushevych told national television the death toll had risen to 10, up from seven reported earlier, Interfax Ukraine news agency said.
Yuriy Sobolevskyi, deputy chair of the regional council, said a missile landed next to a supermarket by the city’s Freedom Square.
“There were civilians there, each of whom lived their own life, went about their own business,” he said, noting a girl selling phone Sim cards, others unloading items from a truck, and passers-by.
There was no word from Moscow, where President Vladimir Putin says his troops are fighting fascism in Ukraine and resisting a Western threat to Russia’s security.
Russia denies targeting civilians.
Ukraine retook the city, the only regional capital Russia had since its Feb 24 invasion, in November. Since then, Kyiv says Russian forces have heavily shelled the city from across the vast Dnipro river.
Since February, Ukraine has driven Russian forces from the areas around Kyiv and the second biggest city Kharkiv. Moscow is now focused on holding its occupied areas in the south and east — around a fifth of Ukraine.
Presidential aide Kyrylo Tymoshenko said the attack came from a Grad multiple rocket launcher.
Another aide, Mykhailo Podolyak, criticised those calling for Kyiv to seek peace talks with Russia, referencing Moscow’s relentless pounding of Ukraine’s power grid since October.
Ukrainian officials say Moscow has already fired over 1,000 rockets at the power grid, and have warned of a bitter winter with huge deficits of power and water pumping capacity, undermining central heating in most Ukrainian homes.
“I’ll remind those who propose to take into account [Russian] ‘peace’ initiatives: right now Russia is ‘negotiating,’ killing Kherson residents, wiping out Bakhmut, destroying Kyiv/Odesa grids, torturing civilians in Melitopol,” Podolyak wrote.
“Russia wants to kill with impunity. Shall we allow it?”  Yanushevych had earlier shared a message from the city’s blood bank calling for urgent donations.
Kyiv was still recovering from Monday’s wave of missile strikes, which knocked out half the city’s power supply into the next day, according to Ukraine’s prime minister.

4,Paris shooter who killed three admits being ‘racist’,PARIS: A 69-year-old white French gunman who opened fire at a Kurdish cultural centre in Paris killing three people...,"PARIS: A 69-year-old white French gunman who opened fire at a Kurdish cultural centre in Paris killing three people told investigators he was racist, a source close to the case said on Saturday, adding that a racial motive had been added to the list of charges.
The shots at the centre and a nearby hairdressing salon shortly before midday on Friday caused panic in the bustling 10th district of the French capital, home to several shops and restaurants and a large Kurdish population.
Three others were wounded in the attack that the gunman attributed to his being  “racist”, the source said. He was found with a case loaded with a box of at least 25 cartridges and  “two or three loaded magazines”, the source added. The weapon was a  “much-used” US Army Colt 1911 pistol.
On Saturday morning, the Paris prosecutor extended the gunman’s period of detention for 24 hours and gave an extra charge of acting with a  “racist motive”. He is already being held on suspicion of murder, attempted murder, armed violence and violating weapons legislation.
French President Emmanuel Macron said  “the Kurds in France have been the target of an odious attack in the heart of Paris” and ordered the Paris police chief to meet with leaders of the Kurdish community.
The gunman, who has a history of racist violence, initially targeted the Kurdish cultural centre before entering a hairdressing salon where he was arrested.
Of the three wounded people, one was being given intensive care in hospital and two were treated for serious injuries.
According to the Kurdish Democratic Council in France (CDK-F), the dead included one woman and two men. Emine Kara was a leader of the Kurdish Women’s Movement in France, the organisation’s spokesman Agit Polat said. Her claim for political asylum in France had been rejected.
The other victims were Abdulrahman Kizil and Mir Perwer, a political refugee and artist, according to the CDK-F. A police source confirmed that Kara and Kizil were among the victims.Thousands of Kurds gathered at Place de la Republique in central Paris on Saturday afternoon where they held a minute of silence for the three killed and those  “who died for freedom”. “What we feel is pain and disbelief because this is not the first time this has happened,” 23-year-old student Esra said.
Police fired tear gas after clashes erupted and the demonstrators threw projectiles at the officers. Journalists at the scene said at least four cars were overturned and one burnt. Hundreds held a similar rally in the southern port city of Marseille.
Three Kurdish women activists were killed in 2013 in the same area of Paris that deeply shook the Kurdish diaspora in France.
Within hours of Friday’s attack, Kurdish protesters clashed with police, who used tear gas in an attempt to disperse them as they tried to break through a police cordon deployed to protect Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who had arrived at the scene.
Demonstrators threw objects at police while voicing fury over an attack they saw as deliberate, and which they said French security services had done too little to prevent.
CDK-F spokesman Polat described the shooting as a  “terrorist” attack.
The shooter — named as William M. in the French media — is a gun enthusiast with a history of weapons offences who had been released on bail earlier this month.

5,Christmas reborn in Bethlehem after pandemic years,"Revered in Christian tradition as birthplace of Christ, Bethlehem welcomes thousands of pilgrims, tourists for Christmas every year.","BETHLEHEM: With a giant evergreen tree, colourful balloons in the streets and selfies in the Church of the Nativity, Christmas tourism has returned to Bethlehem after two years of Covid-related restrictions.
Revered in Christian tradition as the birthplace of Christ, the town of Bethlehem welcomes thousands of pilgrims and tourists for Christmas every year — a windfall that dried up over the past two years due to the coronavirus pandemic and travel restrictions.
Now with restrictions lifted in the Palestinian territories and Israel, where the closest international airport with access to Bethlehem is located, the southern West Bank town has taken on a festive air. Scouts marched with bagpipes as thousands of onlookers lining the streets held balloons and cotton candy.
The Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Pierbattista Pizzaballa, greeted worshippers upon his arrival to the town, ahead of leading the annual Christmas eve procession at the Church of the Nativity.

“Christmas is the town’s celebration, and we put in a lot of time and effort to prepare for it,” Bethlehem mayor Hanna Hanania said.
“We wanted to have international participation, and organised children’s songs and shows with singers from France, South Africa and Malta,” he added.
Tourists converged on the streets, shops and stone buildings of this Palestinian town, where Christians and Muslims live side by side.

6,Iran Supreme Court accepts rapper’s appeal against death sentence,Court had initially accepted the appeals of another protester too but corrected later that only Yasin's appeal had been accepted.,"TEHRAN: Iran’s Supreme Court has accepted the death sentence appeal of rapper Saman Seydi Yasin even as it confirmed a death sentence against another protester, the country’s judiciary said on Saturday.
Yasin, a Kurd who raps about inequality, oppression and unemployment, had been accused of attempting to kill security forces, setting a rubbish bin on fire and shooting three times into the air — charges which he denied.
Yasin’s mother last week pleaded in a video for help to save her son. “Where in the world have you seen a loved one’s life is taken for a trash bin?” she said in the video posted on social media.
The court had initially said it had accepted the appeals of Yasin and another protester but in a subsequent statement, the judiciary’s Mizan news agency said only that of Yasin had been accepted.
“The public relations of the Supreme Court of Iran has corrected its news: ‘The appeal of Mohammad Qabadloo has not been accepted [...] Saman Seydi’s appeal has been accepted by the Supreme Court,” the agency said.
Explaining the decision in its original statement, it cited flaws in investigating the case and said it had been referred back to the court for re-examination. Qabadloo had been charged with killing a police agent and injuring five others during the protests.
Unrest erupted across Iran in mid-September after the death-in-custody of Kurdish Iranian woman Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by morality police enforcing the Islamic Republic’s mandatory dress code laws.
Saturday’s announcement follows the Supreme Court’s suspension of protester Mahan Sadrat’s death sentence 10 days ago. He had been charged with various alleged offences such as stabbing a security officer and setting fire to a motorcycle.
Iran hanged two protesters earlier this month: Mohsen Shekari, 23 — who was accused of blocking a main road in September and wounding a member of the paramilitary Basij force with a knife — and Majid Reza Rahnavard, 23, who was accused of stabbing to death two Basij members and publicly hanged from a construction crane.
Amnesty International has said Iranian authorities are seeking the death penalty for at least 26 people in what it called “sham trials designed to intimidate those participating in the popular uprising that has rocked Iran”.
It said all of those facing death sentences have been denied the right to adequate defence and access to lawyers of their choosing. Rights groups say defendants have instead to rely on state-appointed attorneys who do little to defend them.
Rights group HRANA said that as of Friday, 506 protesters had been killed, including 69 minors. It said 66 members of the security forces had also been killed. As many as 18,516 protesters are believed to have been arrested, it said.
