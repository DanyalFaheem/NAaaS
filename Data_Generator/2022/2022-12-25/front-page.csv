• PTI delegation calls on Punjab CM, Moonis to discuss seat adjustment
LAHORE: The senior leadership of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) deci­ded that Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi will take a vote of confidence ahead of Jan 11 — when the Lahore High Court will take up the case pertaining to his de-notification — to pave the way for Punjab Assembly’s dissolution.
In light of the probable vote of confidence, Punjab Assembly Speaker Sibtain Khan has already summoned the assembly session on Jan 11. Though PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi acknowledged that the chief minister could take a vote of confidence ahead of the next hearing, he added that it was also supposed to be decided whether the governor’s order directing the de-notification of CM Elahi was valid.
PTI meeting at Zaman Park
In a meeting with the party’s senior leadership and journalists at his Zaman Park residence on Saturday, PTI chief Imran Khan predicted that the next general elections would be held in March or April. During the meeting, the PTI chief launched another tirade against former army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa and alleged that Mr Bajwa opposed the accountability of the corrupt during PTI’s last year in power.
The former premier also alleged that the former army chief had struck a “deal” with PPP leader Asif Zardari and Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, observing that was the reason corruption could not be rooted out during the PTI government.
Mr Khan called the alleged deal the reason why accountability of the corrupt could not reach a logical conclusion, as reported by Dawn.com. Mr Bajwa thought that the PTI’s popularity would slide, but it did not happen as per his wishes, Imran Khan claimed.
Preparations for confidence vote
Following the meeting with the former prime minister, PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry told media persons that the PTI and PML-Q had completed their 177 and 10 MPAs strength, respectively, to prep up for the confidence vote in the PA. 
“The chief minister has promised PTI that he will dissolve assemblies soon after taking the vote of confidence — a move that will determine fresh elections,” Mr Chaudhry said. 
Parvez Elahi had also tweeted late on Friday evening that the decision to dissolve assemblies was final and he would implement Imran Khan’s decision.

 





 
Fawad Chaudhry said PML-N ministers Rana Sanaullah and Ahsan Iqbal were making “tall claims” that the government would hold elections when the PTI dissolved its provincial assemblies. “As soon as the PTI announced the date to dissolve assemblies, the PML-N leadership ran away like anything,” he commented. 
The PTI leader added that the PDM government also “ran away from holding local government elections in Islamabad as they had no courage to face the masses”.
Referring to PTI MNAs’ resignations submitted some eight months ago, Mr Chaudhry claimed the National Assembly speaker just disappeared when the PTI announced it would appear in the assembly for the verification of their resignations. “Now the party has decided that its MNAs will reach the assembly while keeping the plan secret,” he said and urged the Supreme Court to look into the resignations’ case.
Meanwhile, a PTI delegation led by Shah Mahmood Qureshi met CM Elahi and his son Moonis. The meeting discussed seat adjustment for the next general elections.

 





 
Moonis’ interview
Separately, PML-Q leader Moonis Elahi, while appearing on a news channel, said Imran Khan had given six days for the dissolution of the Punjab Assembly on Dec 23 because both Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief ministers sought time for development works and relevant issues before disbanding the assemblies.
He rejected the impression that the dissolution of assemblies was being delayed so that the bureaucracy could release funds for the uplift schemes. Explaining another reason, Mr Elahi said President Arif Alvi was busy in backdoor channel talks and Imran Khan wanted to give some time for the outcome of those consultations.
Seat adjustment formula
In response to a question about the seat adjustment formula, Mr Elahi said the PML-Q had requested that both parties should decide about the seat adjustment as assemblies were going to be dissolved.
“Mr Khan immediately constituted a committee, which met thrice to discuss seat adjustment formula and constituencies as far as central Punjab and South Punjab are concerned,” he said and rebuffed the rumours that the PML-Q had demanded 30 MPAs and 15 MNAs seats in the province.
Mr Elahi also said the seat adjustments issues were now being discussed among political people, which was not the case ahead of the 2018 general elections. 
Answering another question, Moonis Elahi said the software of his maternal uncle (Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain) had been updated and added that his uncle’s children had misled him.

1,Shehbaz hints at moving SC against Punjab CM’s restoration,"PML-N terms LHC’s order ""flawed"", believes it will form govt in Punjab next month with allies’ help.","LAHORE: The ongoing power game in Punjab took a new turn on Saturday when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif after a meeting, attended among others by his top legal aide, hinted at moving the Supreme Court against the restoration of Parvez Elahi as chief minister by the Lahore High Court (LHC) a day earlier. 
In its Friday’s order, the LHC had suspended Punjab Governor Balighur Rehman’s order de-notifying the chief minister and restored Mr Elahi and his cabinet on assurance that the assembly will not be dissolved, at least until the next date of hearing — Jan 11. 
“PM Shehbaz discussed challenging the LHC’s verdict in the apex court with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and other cabinet members, including Rana Sanaullah, Tariq Bashir Cheema, Malik Ahmad Khan and Attaullah Tarar at his Model Town residence,” a PML-N leader told Dawn after the meeting.
He said it was likely that the Pak­istan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition would challenge the LHC judgement in the Sup­reme Court in the coming week. 
The premier was given a detailed briefing about the governor’s order de-notifying Mr Elahi and its subsequent suspension by the high court.  

PML-N terms LHC’s order ‘flawed’, believes it will form govt in Punjab next month with allies’ help

“The meeting agreed that the LHC’s decision has certain ‘flaws’ in it and it should be challenged in the apex court,” he said, adding that CM Elahi would eventually have to take the vote of confidence as per the governor’s order.  
“The PM was also told by one of the participants that in January the PML-N and its allied parties would manage to form their government in Punjab in case Mr Elahi fails to get the vote of confidence and a runoff election for the CM slot is held,” the PML-N leader said.  
He pointed out that the purpose of PDM was to thwart Pak­istan Tehreek-i-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan’s plan to dissolve the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assemblies “at least for the time being” and they have managed to achieve that. Further measures required in this regard will also be taken, he said. 
Later, federal ministers Rana Sanaullah and Saad Rafique while speaking at a press conference confirmed that the federal ruling coalition was considering challenging the LHC’s verdict in the apex court.  
“There are ‘flaws’ in the LHC’s decision to restore Mr Elahi and we may challenge it at an appropriate forum,” Mr Rafique said. 
Referring to PTI’s politics, he regretted that PDM was not allowed to work and serve the masses by Imran Khan and ‘his facilitators’ since it came to power eight months ago. He reiterated the federal coalition’s stance that assemblies would complete their tenure and elections would not be held before that. 
Call for suo motu notice Interior Minister Sanaullah urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu notice of the LHC’s verdict.  
“Complete relief has been given to Mr Elahi in the name of temporary relief. The SC should take suo motu notice of the ‘flaws’ in this [LHC’s] decision,” he claimed. 
Mr Sanaullah said his party was ready to contest the elections in Punjab but before that the chief minister would have to take the trust vote.  
“If CM Elahi dissolves the PA after securing the vote of confidence as per the governor’s advice we will go into polls in the province,” he said and claimed that the chief minister could not manage to obtain the vote of confidence as the PTI-PML-Q did not have enjoy the support of the required number of MPAs. 
Interestingly, Railways Minister Rafique said the LHC decision might lead to “horse trading”.  
It may be recalled that PTI senior leader Fawad Chaudhry has recently accused the PMLN-PPP of offering millions of rupees to PTI’s woman lawmakers to switch their loyalty to fail the chief minister in securing the required votes during the trust vote polling.

2,"Flour set to hit new high, chakki atta may reach Rs150 per kg",The price of chakki flour has risen to Rs140 per kg from Rs120 a month ago.,"

FAISALABAD: A large number of people stand in a queue to buy subsidised flour bags at Satyana Road.—Online

 
KARACHI: The retail prices of flour are set to rise further after millers raised the rates by up to Rs11 per kg just three months ahead of the new crop’s arrival in Sindh and Punjab.
In Sindh, millers have increased the price of flour no. 2.5 to Rs115 per kg from Rs104 a week ago and Rs96 last month.
Similarly, the prices of fine and super fine varieties increased to Rs118 from Rs108 per kg a week ago and Rs105 last month. The chakki flour price has risen to Rs140 per kg from Rs120 a month ago.
Aamir Abdullah, chairman of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA) for Sindh, said that the rate of flour no. 2.5, and the fine and super fine varieties had been the highest after the price of a 100kg wheat bag jumped to Rs10,200 in the open market from Rs9,300 a week ago. The bag was selling for Rs8,300 last month.
He dismissed the impression that wheat prices were rising because of smuggling and pointed to traders in the open market who he said had been releasing the grain slowly to fetch more prices until the new crop arrived.
Mr Abdullah said the Sindh government had been providing 10,000 wheat bags per month to each mill, which was insufficient in view of rising flour demand in winter.
“We have been regularly asking the Sindh government to increase mills’ wheat quota for the next three months to curb a further jump in flour prices, but there has been no response so far,” he said.
The Sindh government has fixed the rate of flour no. 2.5 at Rs650 for a 10kg bag (or Rs65 a kilogram) and the millers are getting subsidised wheat at Rs5,825 per 100kg to provide relief to the masses.
When asked why this subsidy was not being passed on to citizens, he said 150 vehicles carrying 600-700 10kg bags each reach around 90 sales points and 250-300 shops daily in several areas of Karachi, but this was not enough to cater to the huge demand of the city’s millions of residents.
Mr Abdullah said the millers could only get a third of subsidised wheat released by the Sindh government and had to lift the rest from the open market at higher rates, thus resulting in higher flour prices. He claimed that flour rates in Sindh were still lower than in Punjab.
Farid Qureshi, general secretary of the Karachi Retail Grocers Group (KRGG), said the makers of high-quality fine flour — such as Ashrafi and Bake Parlour — had raised prices by Rs7 per kg and the new prices were set to cross Rs650 and Rs1,300 per 5kg and 10kg, respectively.
He said chakki flour rates would rise to Rs150 from Rs140 per kg, whereas the retail rates of flour no. 2.5, and fine and super fine varieties would also rise in sync with the hike made by millers. He said the retail rates usually remained higher by 10-15 per kg than the millers’ rates.
He urged Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah to take notice of the persistent jump in flour rates which would hit the consumers badly during Ramazan, starting from the third week of March.
The provincial government had 7.5m tonnes of wheat in its stock in the first week of this month, enough to supply flour to the people at subsidised rates until March 2023.
The government had set a target of procuring 1.4m tonnes of wheat in the current season. It procured one million tonnes from farmers and 400,000 tonnes from the state-run Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco).
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, Pakistan spent $2.24bn to import around 6.92m tonnes of wheat from July 2020 to November this year to bridge the demand and supply gap.
During the first five months (July to November) of the current fiscal year, wheat imports stood at 1.1m tonnes ($460m) compared to 1.023m tonnes ($340m) a year ago. The average per-tonne price of grain stood at $419 during the five months compared to $332 in the year-ago period.

3,Quaid’s birth anniversary being observed today,PM Shahbaz calls on nation to take guidance from the Quaid’s life.,"


 
ISLAMABAD: The 146th birth anniversary of the father of the nation, Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, will be observed on Sunday (today) with renewed pledge to uphold his guiding principles of unity, faith and discipline. 
The day will dawn with special prayers for security, progress and prosperity of the country. The national flag will be hoisted on major government buildings throu­gh­out the country. Special events will be arranged to promote the ideals and views of the founder of Pakistan, particularly with regard to rule of law, supremacy of the Constitution, and upholding of democracy.
Public and private departments across the country will hold a variety of events, including seminars, conferences, competitions and discussion programmes, to highlight the messages and vision of the Quaid.
Messages shedding light on various aspects of the Quaid’s struggle for the achievement of a separate homeland for the Muslims of the subcontinent were issued by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other leaders.
Prime Minister Sharif called on the nation to take guidance from the Quaid’s life and follow his principles to ensure the progress and prosperity of Pakistan.
The struggle of Quaid-i-Azam was against the idea of a majority usurping the rights of minorities on the basis of numerical superiority, the premier said, adding that he had strived for the restoration of a unique way of life of Muslims and for their separate social, economic, political and cultural identity in the comity of nations.
PM Shehbaz pointed out that because of the rising religious animosity and the thinking of extremist Hindutva, India as a state had failed to protect rights of the minorities. This situation has proved right the Quaid’s arguments for the two-nation theory, he stressed.
The PM said that Pakistan was going through a difficult phase at present and the need to follow the Quaid’s principles had become more necessary to follow than ever. The best way to pay tribute to him was to make Pakistan an Islamic welfare state.
“We have to put an end to internal chaos and work tirelessly for the advancement of Pakistan,” he said.
Former president and PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari on the occasion said Peoples Party was steadfast on its resolve to make Pakistan a democratic and welfare state.
He said the founder of Pakistan was a true democrat and an enlightened leader who advocated for human and religious freedom.
Mr Zardari said PPP would continue to defend freedom of expression and political and religious liberty in the country founded by the Quaid-i-Azam.
He said the 1973 Constitution given by Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was a guarantee of stability. 
Paying tribute to the Quaid, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan said his dedication and unflinching resolve for the cause of freedom would always be remembered.
“We could lead country on the way of progress and prosperity by following the golden principles of the father of nation,” he said. 
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo said the nation should pledge to play its role for the stability of the country and the promotion of national unity by putting aside political and group differences.
In his message, he said the country was facing challenges, and maintaining unity in “our ranks and upholding the golden principles of the father of the nation is the need of the hour”.

4,US willing to fund Afghan border security: Bilawal,"On Washington’s offer to mediate with India, FM says relations with Delhi ""not discussed in meetings, only public statements"".","WASHINGTON: Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said the United States is willing to provide Pakistan funds to enhance border security for preventing cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.
Responding to queries from Dawn, the foreign minister said that during his visit to the US Congress last week, two senior senators — Bob Menendez from New Jersey and Lindsey Graham from South Carolina — told him that they were provided “funding in the 2023 budget to help us with border security”.
Senator Menendez chairs the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations while Senator Graham, a senior Republican, heads the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said, while emphasising the strong standing of the two lawmakers.
Responding to a question about the US offer of help to improve relations with India, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said: “They never brought up India other than in public statements.”

On Washington’s offer to mediate with India, FM says relations with Delhi ‘not discussed in meetings, only public statements’

At a news briefing in Washington on Dec 19, US State Department’s Spokes­person Ned Price noted Afghanistan-based terrorist groups like the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan have recently increased attacks on Pakistani targets and offered help to Islamabad to deal with the “increasingly dangerous threat”.
“We have partnered with our Pakistani friends to help them take on this challenge. We stand ready to assist, whether with this unfolding situation or more broadly,” Mr Price said.
During the foreign minister’s visit to the UN headquarters in New York last week, both India and Pakistan engaged in a war of words over occupied Kashmir and other issues. Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar called Pakistan “the hub of terrorism” that “hosted Osama bin Laden”.
In his riposte, Mr Bhutto-Zardari reminded that India Prime Minister Narendra Modi was once called “the butcher of Gujarat” and that while bin Laden was dead “Mr Modi lives and is India’s prime minister”.
Asked to comment on these statements, Mr Price underlined “the indispensability of maintaining valuable partnerships” with both India and Pakistan.
“The fact that we have partnerships with both countries leaves us not wanting to see a war of words between India and Pakistan,” he said.
“We would like to see constructive dialogue between them. The United States stands ready to assist as a partner to both.”
But the foreign minister’s response to Dawn made it clear that while the US wanted good relations between the two South Asian neighbours, it appears keener to cooperate with Islamabad in com­bating terrorist attacks from Afghanistan.
This also reflects in the omnibus bill that Congress passed on Friday, setting aside $200 million for promoting gender equality in Pakistan and also emphasising the need to combat terrorism.
The bill doesn’t mention a specific amount for combating terrorism, but it does say that funds appropriated under the heading “Foreign Military Financing Program” can be “made available only to support counterterrorism and counterinsurgency capabilities in Pakistan.”
It also noted the funds appropriated for “International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement” shall be made available for border security programmes in Pakistan.”
Commenting on the US offers, former ambassador Touqir Hussain, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, told Dawn that defeating terrorism was a shared goal of both countries.
“So, the US cannot only ask for Pakistan’s help without offering its own help. It is a shared challenge which neither can address alone.”
Mr Hussain noted the public statement of support for Pakistan was “obviously a part of the ongoing US efforts to rehabilitate [its ]image in the country.”
He said the offer to assist India and Pakistan in resolving their differences, was “important not so much for its practical value – in the resolution of India Pakistan differences, which is not much as India would not accept outside involvement – but the context in which this offer is made.”
“The language with which the respective relations with India and Pakistan have been described is clearly meant to convey a shift away from the US’ South Asia policy of recent years resting on the centrality of India,” the former ambassador pointed out.
In the statement, Mr. Price spoke of a “global strategic partnership with India” and a “deep partnership … with Pakistan.”
“Each of them is indispensable to us,” said the spokesperson.
He added that “the promotion and the pursuit of shared goals” with India and Pakistan were equally important to the US.
