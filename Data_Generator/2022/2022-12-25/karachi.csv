KARACHI: This is Christmas Eve and the main downtown Saddar market, especially Bohri Bazaar, is abuzz with Christmas shoppers looking for best last-minute bargain deals.
Preparations for the celebrations are in full swing in the metropolis.  
As churches in the city are decorated with special colourful lights with Christmas Star on the top, shoppers flock markets to purchase Christmas gifts for their loved ones.  
For most families, the celebrations are, however, incomplete without a Christmas tree and of course a decorated one.  
For Christmas decorations, colourful glass balls, decorative gold and silver bells, reindeer, wreaths, fairy lights, stars, other decorative tree hangings and of course a Christmas tree are all the must haves.  

While queues at bakeries get longer, Christmas tree prices go up

The shops at Bohri Bazaar have all the variety to make merry Christmas merrier.  
The bakeries around Saddar, too, are busy preparing and selling plum cakes as well as other cream cakes with Christmas decorations.  
If you go to any other part of the town for Christmas shopping, neither are you going to find so much variety at confectioners, nor at the shops and stalls selling decorations. And what’s more, the prices also are not the same.  
A nice stall selling Christmas stuff outside a supermarket in Clifton will try to sell you a plastic Christmas tree, made in China, for Rs9,000.  
A raised eyebrow gets you the following answer: “It is eight feet tall madam.” 
Then as you turn your attention to a shorter, five-feet tall tree and inquire about its cost, you are informed that it costs Rs10,000. The explanation: “It’s a decorated tree, madam.” Well, yes. If you can call four to six small glass balls and a string of beads carelessly wound around it, a decorated tree, then you also don’t deserve to part with Rs10,000.  
But if you are wise and brave enough to fight the traffic which you are sure to run into on the way, you may drive to Bohri Bazaar, and get to choose from an extensive variety of Christmas trees, all plastic though, all Chinese, too, but more reasonably priced.  
There are bright green ones, dark green ones and snow-covered ones in various heights, including cute baby Christmas trees which can be placed on tables.  
When the guy at the stall in Clifton was asked what was new this year, he pointed to the big red Christmas stocking that he was selling also. They looked slightly old and used but the fellow insisted that they were new. “Look, they didn’t sell last year so the faux fur looks old and ruffled,” he explained while quoting Rs200 to Rs250 for each.  
In Saddar, the same old stockings are on sale for Rs150 or Rs100 each, depending on your bargaining skills. And they will also throw in a red Santa’s cap while admitting that it is all second-hand stuff.  
Bakeries 
Meanwhile the bakeries in Saddar paint a different picture from the bakeries in other parts of the city where they won’t have Christmas cakes at all. And those that might have any will be extremely expensive. “It’s because the Saddar area has many Christian residents,” explained the gentleman minding a counter of United Bakery in Saddar.  
At the historic Misquita Bakery, again you will see the lines and queues forming, similar to what you encountered around Good Friday and Easter for the hot cross buns. This time it is for their sweet plum cakes.  
More and more now, the joy of Christmas is also spreading among non-Christian families, who have developed a taste for Christmas cakes and find them absolutely delicious and mouth-watering. Many people also buy and decorate Christmas trees because they want to be included in the festivity too as Muslims also share the joy and happiness with their Christian friends.

3,‘Zia era spelled doom for coffee house culture’,Gambit on the Devil’s Chessboard launched...,"KARACHI: A novel titled Gambit on the Devil’s Chessboard by Dr Imran H Khan was launched at a local hotel on Saturday evening. 
Pakistan Peoples Party leader and former Senate chairman Senator Mian Raza Rabbani, the chief guest on the occasion, said for the last couple of days his host [of the launch] had been trying to create an illusion or delusion that book reading and writing is something which is top priority in Pakistan. 
“But I think the way Javed Jabbar [who spoke earlier about the author being a doctor living abroad] gave examples of Pakistanis that wrote books with the common factor that they live abroad. This goes to show that the Pakistani state itself decided that the coffee house culture that existed in the country — which generated thought, thesis and counter thesis, intellectuals — needed to be brought to an end. 
“The Zia era was the most responsible to end that culture. After that what we have seen is that there exists no academic freedom in Pakistan. Dissent is something that’s not to be tolerated as a result of which we are unable to produce people such as Jaun Elia, Habib Jalib and Rais Amrohvi. 

Gambit on the Devil’s Chessboard launched

“The book is a breath of fresh air in the circumstances that we find ourselves in. I personally believe it to be [a book of] fictional reality. There is a great deal of similarity between this fictional reality and my own two books — The Smile Snatchers and Invisible People — because the situations and characters are real, only their names are fictitious. In the book, I can relate to Operation Shangri La, I can relate to the description of torture, rice pudding, and relate to the conversation between the chief of army staff-designate and the prime minister. 
“When you look at the book, as has been said by speakers before me, there is a striking similarity between situations and characters we find in Pakistan at present... The book portrays goodie goodie western capitalists looking for an opportunity to help the downtrodden and oppressed people in Third World countries. But in reality, it is this new form of colonialism, neocolonialism whereby the resources of Third World countries are exploited by them,” he said. 
Former federal minister Javed Jabbar said most novels tend to move at the speed of 70 to 80 miles per hour, but Mr Khan’s starts at 140 miles per hour and never slows down, maintaining relentless, frenetic, breakneck speed. One has to pay a price if one wants to maintain such a speed. “It’s a pictorial novel without pictures, full of dialogue. Its language is austere, precise, neat, perhaps too neat, no scope for shades and no time to explore nuances.”
He gave the author the advice to turn his publication into an audio book since it’s easy on the tongue and easy to hear. “It has an imaginative plot, intricate, full of twists and turns.” 
The other advice that the former senator put forward was to come up with a sequel to the book.
The author of the novel, Imran H Khan, said when he set out to write the book there were several ideas spinning in his head. He first thought of writing nonfiction but it didn’t work out; then he began writing it as a novel. 
“I had already written my 15th draft and thought to myself it’s very easy. After the 15th draft, I gave the manuscript to the father of the director of the cancer centre [where he works] who is a literary person. He replied that it was interesting but it didn’t read like fiction. So I went to my mentor, writer Jerry Jenkins, and took a six-month class with him, and that really helped me,” he said.
Prof Kaleem Raza Khan said he’d read the book twice, once as a critic, and then as a reader. He liked it as a reader. The author’s use of metaphors is praiseworthy.
Dr Huma Baqai said fact is stranger than fiction but when you create fiction, which is grounded in facts, then the result is spectacular. “The book will resonate with each one of us because it’s close to reality.”
Senior journalist Muhammad Ali Siddiqi talked about the importance of ‘ambience’ in a novel. He added that the novel tells the story through dialogue that takes place in different multinational companies.
Calling the book ‘engaging’, Ameena Saiyid said she was given the novel to read two weeks ago but she finished reading it in three days. “I couldn’t put it down, it’s so fast paced, it resonated with me.” 
Faisal Siddiqi and Abid Azhar also spoke.

7,Keel-laying of first Hangor class submarine held,Naval chief confident the submarines will play a leading role in catering to the operational needs of the navy.,"KARACHI: The indigenous submarine development project in Pakistan achieved another milestone when the keel laying ceremony of the first Hangor class submarine and steel cutting of the second submarine was held at the Karachi Shipyard & Engineering Works (KS&EW) here on Saturday. 
Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Mohammed Amjad Khan Niazi was the chief guest on the occasion.
The defence agreement between Pakistan and China included development of eight Hangor class submarines including the four under construction at the Wuchang Shipbuilding Industry Group (WSIG) in China and the remaining four being built at the shipyard under the transfer of technology (ToT) agreement.
The construction work of first submarine to be made at KS&EW Pakistan took place in December on 2021 and now the keel laying was carried out, which is a major milestone in the history of any naval vessel being constructed. Concurrently, construction work on another submarine has also started with its steel cutting at the same shipyard.
A Hangor class submarine is capable to undertake a variety of missions as per operational dictates. The submarine possesses advanced stealth features and fitted with state-of-the-art weapons and sensors to operate under multi-threat environment and can engage targets at stand-off ranges.
Speaking on the occasion, the naval chief said that it was a matter of great pride for him to witness the keel laying and steel cutting of two submarines. 
“Pakistan Navy is aware of the evolving geo-strategic situation in our region and will continue to develop naval potential, improve shipbuilding infrastructure and equip platforms with advanced weapons/sensors to counter traditional as well as asymmetric threats,” he said.
Admiral Niazi showed confidence that these submarines would play a leading role in catering to the operational needs of the navy.
Earlier, the representative of M/s China Shipbuilding Offshore Company (CSOC) expressed his gratitude for the ceremony. 
He added that his company would ensure seamless provision of all resources/support for the smooth construction of submarines in Pakistan. 
He further said that the Pakistan-China friendship is deep-rooted and shares common objectives.
The ceremony was also attended by other representatives of M/s CSOC (China) and other high-ranking officials.

10,Dadu administration can be proceeded against: SHC,Inspection by civil judge proves laxity in keeping city clean,"HYDERABAD: The Hyderabad circuit bench of the Sindh High Court has directed Dadu civil judge to supervise schemes of the city undertaken in the light of court orders, inspect ongoing work on the schemes and submit report every fortnight. 
The division bench comprising Justices Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Adnanul Karim Memon passed the order the other day on a public interest petition filed by Mumtaz Ahmed Lashari advocate and directed Sindh finance department to share with the court details of the funds released to Dadu administration since June 2022.
The court said the judge would make sure that the directions contained in previous orders had been complied with by the district administration. 
The court adjourned the matter to Jan 19 after going through a report of the civil judge submitted to the court in compliance with the last order. The court directed the authorities concerned, including deputy commissioner Dadu, to initiate a scheme for laying a new pipeline in the city. 

Inspection by civil judge proves laxity in keeping city clean

The judge’s report highlighted that the city lacked basic mechanism for keeping it clean and hygienic. The drainage line along the main road from SSP Chowk to Shahjahan Park was found blocked, choked and filled with sewage at Cinema Chowk while the sewage damaged infrastructure and caused traffic gridlock at main points across the city, said the report. 
It noted that a drainage line of 24 inch diameter had been installed in late 60s which had not been replaced since. The old drainage line had proved inadequate to pass the increasing amount of sewage, it said, adding that heaps of garbage were found lying at Moundhar Naka Chowk while main nullah was seen unconnected with the main disposal scheme. The work on 200ft to 300ft of the nullah remained to be completed, he said.
The court reproduced the judge’s report in its order with the observation that “the report appears to be a sufficient charge-sheet for initiating proceedings against the Dadu district administration”. 
The bench said that representatives of the district administration had argued during the hearing that the district was short of funds and finance department was not cooperating with it.
Hence, the court directed the Sindh finance department to submit all details on the funds disbursed to the district administration since June 2022 and to what end, including but not limited to, uplifting infrastructure and/or for initiating new schemes.
The bench noted that so far no direction given in previous orders had been complied with and no work had been undertaken yet. The boundary wall around main graveyards was yet to be built and when the civil judge directed Dadu mukhtiarkar to provide him a map of Lal Hindi graveyard, he fell silent, it said.
The court asked the mukhtiarkar concerned to provide a complete map of the graveyards of Pir Mohammad Murad and Lal Hindi to the civil judge for further proceedings.

11,‘Fear of death turned secular intellectual religious’,Debate makes day 2 of ‘Ayaz Melo’ lively,"HYDERABAD: A session on the kinds of love Shaikh Ayaz pursued in his life on the second day of 8th Ayaz Melo on Saturday turned into a lively arena where speakers debated on the poet’s transformation from atheist-secular into religious and so the meaning of love he referred to in the poetry in his later life. 
Ayaz considered his poetry to be his beloved but in his personal life or when it came to discussing ‘ishq’ (love) the celebrated poet had weaknesses, especially after he turned religious, and apparently fear of death was at play behind this transformation, they said at the session on Ishq tunhjo Ayaz aahae insaan saan: Ayaz je ishq ja andailti rang” (Ayaz, your true love is with humanity: rainbow colours of Ayaz’s love) at Mumtaz Mirza auditorium in Sindh museum.  
Moderated by Samina Abro, the session was dominated by in interesting war of words between Adal Soomro and Dr Sahar Gul Bhatti who dwelt at length on different aspects of Ayaz’s personal life, poetry and works.  
Sahar Gul said that Ayaz had been a progressive poet and his journey of ishq was long. He had gone too far in describing man’s qualities and his potential but then he himself made a shift from being an atheist or secular to a believer and was clearly overwhelmed by divine love but at later stage in his life he became scared of death which was indeed not his love for the omnipotent. 

Debate makes day 2 of ‘Ayaz Melo’ lively

Adal Soomro disagreed with the moderator on framing of her question and said that this session was all about discussing how personality of Ayaz had evolved. It should be discussed more broadly. “Ayaz also loved birds and Indus river or Sadhu Belo [in Sukkur],” he said. 
Sahar Gul said that there were aspects of Ayaz’s personality that could be critically evaluated. At some point of time his decline was perceived in his thoughts when he made a departure from his popular progressive thoughts.  
“At one point Ayaz appeared to be influenced by particular conditions. Progressive researchers must research both aspects of his life,” she said. Ayaz as a person, she said, had weaknesses too as he was involved with women. 
Adal Soomro said that a woman wanted to marry him but he declined and let her go to lead her life and similarly a film personality was involved with him. Ayaz even discussed her in her poetry to great chagrin of her husband to which Sahar Gul interjected to say that without respect and honour love became irrelevant. Adal was of the view that a poet always believed in love which was often one-sided. 
Amar Pirzado said that Ayaz considered his poetry his beloved and his art of expression was very strong. The poet was able to transfer his ishq to youth who danced involuntarily on his poetry, he said, adding his poetry was diversified and the element of romance was quite dominating in it. 
Another panelist, Amar Iqbal, said that Ayaz had defined the terror of river in a classic manner. Ayaz’s concept of poetry was above religion, country and language and this had led to issuance of edicts against him, he said.
