0,"Alvi writes to PM, CJP on ‘threat’ to Murad Saeed’s life",President recalls how the ex-minister had raised Malakand issue.,"ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Saturday invited the attention of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif as well as Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Umar Ata Bandial towards life threats and alleged human right violations on part of the federal government and the state machinery towards PTI leader Murad Saeed.
In separate letters, the president asked the prime minister and the CJP to look into the issues raised by Mr Saeed to alleviate his grievances.
The letters have been written in response to a five-page letter, dated Dec 12, sent by former minister for communications Murad Saeed requesting the president to ensure ‘brazen illegalities’ and ‘gross human right violations’ by the federal government and its agencies should not be permitted under latter’s watch. The ex-minister also expressed the hope that his letter would “not become part of the unattended and overlooked archives of the state”.
President Alvi, in his letters to the top functionaries, referred to serious allegat­i­o­­ns levelled by the parliamentarian that int­er alia included: fake, bogus, frivolous FIR registered against him for the May 1, 2022 incident that occurred at Masjid-i-Nabvi despite the fact that he was in Pakistan.

President recalls how the ex-minister had raised Malakand issue

Multiple FIRs were registered against Mr Saeed on same charges all over Pakistan, the letters highlighted, adding the action was against the fundamental rights enshrined under Articles 9,13, and 14 of the Constitution dealing with security of person, protection against double punishment and self-incrimination and inviolability of dignity of man, respectively.
The president in his letters recalled how Mr Saeed had raised the issue of deteriorating law and order situation in Malakand. Subsequently, he was threatened with dire consequences. He was compelled by the law enforcement agencies to leave Swat, along with his family.
The letters also referred to Article 15 of the Constitution, which states: “Every citizen shall have the right to remain in, and, subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by law in the public interest, enter and move freely throughout Pakistan and to reside and settle in any part thereof.”
Moreover, Mr Saeed raised the issue that on Aug 18, 2022, unidentified armed persons violated the privacy of his home, but Islamabad Police did not register an FIR despite his repeated requests and court’s order. He also claimed unknown persons frequently followed and harassed him with ‘serious life threats’, the letters mentioned, adding that it appeared as if the entire state machinery was failing in its duty and performance of functions.
President Alvi pointed out that such alleged acts were in violation of Article 9 of the Constitution and the law.
Mr Saeed also wrote the president that he had been informed many a time by responsible officials that his life was under serious threat and that it was unclear whether the persons following him were members of a terrorist organisation or some law enforcement agencies. He further alleged that ra­­ther than apprehending and prosecuting those harassing him, the entire state ma­­ch­inery was “helping, facilitating and assisting the persons” who were after his life.
The PTI leader bemoaned that whenever he travelled by car, he was followed by suspicious vehicles. His movement was being monitored, the letter said, adding outside his house, he frequently spots suspicious men, motorcycles and vehicles with often with fake number plates parked outside his house.
The former minister recalled that in July last year, when the law and order situation in Malakand (Swat), started to deteriorate, he through his information and his understanding of the complexities of the region and the powers at play was able to timely identify the looming threat and mobilised the people of Malakand and Swat valiantly and staunchly stood to safeguard the peace and development they had earned after years of unrest and sacrificing thousands of lives.

1,CM reviews law and order in Balochistan,Says there will be no compromise on law and order.,"QUETTA: A high-level meeting to review the law and order situation in the province has decided to take strong measures in view of the recent wave of terrorist attacks across the country.
The meeting was chaired by Balochistan Chief Min­ister Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo on Friday.
The meeting directed the security agencies to keep a vigilant eye on the activities of the banned organisations.
There would be no compromise on the law and order and nobody would be allowed to impede the development in the process, the CM vowed.
Additional Chief Secr­etary Home and Tribal Affairs, Zahid Saleem, Insp­e­ctor General of Police Abdul Khaliq Sheikh, Quetta Com­missioner Sohailur Rehman Baloch, and Special Branch DIG attended the meeting while Home Minister Ziau­llah Langove and divisional commissioners participated through a video link.
The additional chief secretary home and other officials briefed the meeting about the overall law and order situation in the province and about the measures taken to counter terrorism threats.
Makran division commissioner said most demands of the Haq Do Tehreek — which is protesting over illegal trawling and other issues — have been implemented while the government also held talks with Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, who is leading the movement.
He blamed Mr Rehman for ‘repeatedly changing his sta­n­ce’ and added that it created hurdles in the negotiations.
The meeting also decided to increase the strength of security personnel in sensitive districts.

2,Azam Swati denies posting ‘anti-army’ tweets in bail plea,"Says case was registered under influence of ""hostile regime"".","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Azam Swati has filed a bail application claiming that he never posted ‘controversial tweets’ against the army.
In his bail plea, filed in the Islamabad High Court on Saturday, the PTI leader disassociated himself from the tweets and sought a post-arrest bail in the case registered against him for inciting mutiny in the army and defamation.
The petition stated: “The alleged tweets were not posted by the petitioner nor he has any intention to defame any respectable institution.”
In the petition, Mr Swati, who is also a member of the Senate, stated he was falsely implicated due to the ‘political influence of a hostile regime’.
After registration of the FIR, Mr Swati pleaded his physical remand was granted to the FIA and then handed over to Balochistan Police.

Says case was registered under influence of ‘hostile regime’

According to the plea, Mr Swati was facing eight ‘identical’ first information reports (FIRs) in Balochistan and 37 in Sindh.
It added that Balochistan High Court (BHC) and Sindh High Court (SHC) have already ordered to quash the FIRs. He pleaded he had applied for bail before the FIA’s special court but the judge dismissed the plea.
While rejecting Mr Swati’s previous bail plea, the judge observed he repeated the same offence of ‘maligning the armed forces’ while being on bail in an identical case.
In the petition, Mr Swati said he was 75 years old and suffering from heart disease and the case against him was based on a ‘documented allegation.’
There was no useful purpose of keeping him in judicial custody which, the petition stated, was tantamount to “pun­i­shment in advance” in offences for which the trial was yet to commence.”
The petition added the investigation has already been completed and Mr Swati was no longer required for the investigation “In such an eventuality, his continuous detention behind the bars will serve no useful purpose,” the petition pleaded.
Mr Swati has requested the court to grant him post-arrest bail till the conclusion of the trial.
The FIA arrested Mr Swati on November 27 for ‘defamation, statement conducing to public mischief and a highly obnoxious campaign of intimidating tweets.’
He was taken into custody after his fiery speech at the PTI’s long march in Rawalpindi where he lashed out at the military leadership.

3,WB wants transparent use of flood aid,"WB directors emphasise need for provincial, federal authorities to  strengthen implementation systems in place.","ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has underscored the importance of having strong monitoring and evaluation systems in place to ensure reconstruction funds approved for Sindh last week are used transparently and reach those most in need in the flood-affected districts.
In a summary of the executive board meeting, the World Bank directors emphasised the need for provincial and federal authorities to strengthen the implementation systems in place to ensure increased absorption capacity of development funding and also ensure the adequate targeting of communities.
A brief summary of the observations made by executive directors was made available to Dawn on Saturday. 
The directors welcomed the emphasis on donor coordination and citizen engagement, particularly for the post-damage needs assessment and long-term flood preparation and response.
The World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors last week approved $1.69 billion in financing for five projects to support people living in flood-affected areas of Sindh. 
Three projects support rehabilitation and housing reconstruction and the restoration of crop production for vulnerable communities, while another two projects support health services for mothers and children.

4,Extreme weather events highlight need to do more: WMO,"Plans to promote monitoring of sinks, sources of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide.","ISLAMABAD: Weather, water and climate-related disasters, including extreme flooding, heat and drought affected millions of people and cost billions in 2022, as the tell-tale signs and impacts of human-induced climate change intensified.
The events of 2022 once again underlined the clear need to do much more to cut greenhouse gas emissions — with better monitoring — and to strengthen climate change adaptation — including thorough universal access to early warnings, according to the World Meteorological Organ­isation (WMO).
Past eight years were on track to be the eight warmest on record, the WMO stated on Saturday. Global temperature figures for 2022 will be released in mid-January. The persistence of a cooling La Niña event, now in its third year, means that 2022 will not be the warmest year on record. But this cooling impact will be short-lived and will not reverse the long-term warming trend caused by record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, the UN agency stated. 
“This year we have faced several dramatic weather disasters which claimed far too many lives and livelihoods and undermined health, food, energy and water security and infrastructure. One third of Pakistan was flooded, with major economic losses and human casualties. Record breaking heat waves have been observed in China, Europe, North and South America. The long-lasting drought in the Horn of Africa threatens a huma­n­itarian catastrophe,” said WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas.

Plans to promote monitoring of sinks, sources of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide

“There is a need to enhance preparedness for such extreme events and to ensure that we meet the UN target of Early Warnings for All in the next five years,” said Prof Taalas.
Early warnings, increasing investment in the basic global observing system and building resilience to extreme weather and climate will be among WMO priorities in 2023 — the year in which the WMO community celebrates its 150th anniversary.
The WMO will also promote a new way of monitoring the sinks and sources of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide by using the ground-based Global Atmosphere Watch, satellite and assimilation modeling. This allows better understanding of the behaviour of the key greenhouse gases in the real atmosphere. 
There are for example large uncertainties related to the strength of sinks of carbon in the biosphere and sources of methane, which will be better monitored with the new method, said Prof Taalas.
Rising sea level
Greenhouse gases are just one of the climate indicators now at record observed levels. Sea level, ocean heat content and acidification — are also at record observed highs. The rate of sea level rise has doubled since 1993. It has risen by nearly 10 mm since January 2020 to a new record high this year. The past two and a half years alone account for 10 per cent of the overall rise in sea level since satellite measurements started nearly 30 years ago, according to WMO’s provisional State of the Global Climate in 2022 report.
The year took an exceptionally heavy toll on glaciers in the European Alps, with initial indications of record-shattering melt. The Greenland ice sheet lost mass for the 26th consecutive year and it rained (rather than snowed) on the summit for the first time in September, the WMO stated.
Although 2022 did not break global temperature records, there were a number of national heat records in many parts of the world.
Large parts of the northern hemisphere were exceptionally hot and dry. India and Pakistan saw record-breaking heat in March and April. China had the most extensive and long-lasting heatwave since national records began and the second-driest summer on record.
Large parts of Europe sweltered in repeated episodes of extreme heat. The United Kingdom saw a new national record on July 19, when the temperature topped more than 40°C for the first time. This was accompanied by persistent and damaging drought and wildfires.
Record breaking rain in July and August led to extensive flooding in Pakistan. There were at least 1,700 deaths and 33 million people affected. Around 7.9 million people were displaced. 
A large area centred around the central-northern part of Argentina, and also southern Bolivia, central Chile, and most of Paraguay and Uruguay, experienced record-breaking temperatures during two consecutive heat waves in late November and early December 2022.

6,"No headway in talks between govt, Gwadar protesters",The protesters have been holding a sit-in at the Expressway.,"GWADAR: The negotiations between the Balochistan government and protest leaders of ‘Haq Du Tehreek’ failed to make any headway on Saturday.
The protesters have been holding a sit-in at the Expressway, the road leading to key installations like the port and the under construction Gwadar International Airport.
The Chinese engineers and other staff working on the construction of the airport reached their workplace on Saturday using the sea route as the expressway has been closed for three days.
Balochistan Home Minister Mir Ziaullah Langove and Advisor to Balochistan chief minister on Public Health Engineering,  Lala Rasheed reached Gwadar on the direction of the chief minister to hold talks with the protesters.
According to officials, negotiations were held between the government team and second-tier leadership of the ‘Haq Du Tehreek’. The movement’s head Maulana Hidayatur Rehman and another senior leader Hussian Wadila did not participate in the negotiations, the officials added.
Although officials confirmed that no progress was made, Mr Langove told the media the talks were held in a good atmosphere with an agreement to continue negotiations to resolve all issues.
He said some demands, relating to border trade with Iran have been referred to the federal government as the subject fell within their domain and they will take up the matter with the relevant stakeholders.
Maulana Rehman said the ministers who had come for the talks had “no authority” to resolve the issues. “If our demands are not met our sit-in will continue,” he warned.The protests have been going on for more than a month demanding a ban on illegal trawling in Gwadar and eliminating unnecessary checkpoints, among several other issues.

7,Afghan students in Quetta protest Taliban’s education ban,Protesters say the people of Afghanistan will not tolerate such autocratic orders and will resist the move.,"


 
QUETTA: Afghan students protested in the provincial capital on Saturday against the Afghan government’s decision to ban women’s university education.
The students, including women, gathered in front of the Quetta Press Club carrying placards and banners inscribed with their demands and slogans against the neighbouring country’s government.
They also chanted slogans against the decision of the Taliban government and said it would deprive half of the country’s population of education.
Speaking to the demonstrators, students Saaduddin and Maria strongly condemned the education ban and alleged that the present Afghan government wanted to push the new female generation into an era of darkness. 
They said the people of Afghanistan, especially women, would not tolerate such autocratic orders and would resist the move.
“Pakistan and other countries should play their role in making the Afghan government withdraw the ban on college and university-level education for women,” Maria said, adding that our struggle would continue until the ban was lifted.
