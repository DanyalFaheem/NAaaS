0,Taliban order NGOs to ban working women,"Suspension of women’s access to higher education against Islam, says Al Azhar grand imam","KABUL: In the latest crackdown on women’s freedom just a day after Al Azhar university rejected the Taliban’s decision to suspend women’s access to university education, Afghanistan’s Taliban-run administration ordered all local and foreign non-governmental organisations to stop female employees from coming to work, according to an economy ministry letter.
The letter, confirmed by economy ministry spokesperson Abdulrahman Habib on Saturday, said the female employees were not allowed to work until further notice, because some of them had not adhered to the administration’s interpretation of Islamic dress code for women.
It was not immediately clear whether the order applied to the United Nations agencies, which have a large presence in Afghanistan.
It comes days after the Taliban-run administration ordered universities to close to women, prompting strong global condemnation and sparking some protests and sharp criticism inside Afghanistan. 
The Al Azhar grand imam earlier on Friday rejected the ban on women’s education in Afghanistan by Taliban, calling it contradictory to Islamic Shariah.

Suspension of women’s access to higher education against Islam, says Al Azhar grand imam

The head of most prestigious university for Islamic learning, Sheikh Ahmad Al Tayeb, expressed concern over the suspension of women’s access to university education in Afghanistan and condemned the decision.
Asking the Afghan authorities to reconsider their decision, Sheikh Ahmad said Al Azhar deeply regretted the move to prevent Afghan women access to university education. He said it contradicted Islamic Shariah and conflicted its explicit call for men and women to pursue knowledge from the cradle to the grave.
“This shocking decision to the conscience of Muslims and non-Muslims alike should not have been issued by any Muslim, let alone proudly clinging to it. I explicitly reject this decision since it does not represent the Shariah of Islam,” he said.
According to Tolo News, Afghan religious scholars have also asked the Islamic Emirate to reopen universities for women.
Fazl Hadi Wazin, a member of the international religious scholars’ council, said the presence of women in separate dormitories under the leadership of the ministry of higher education was never against Shariah.
Another scholar, Mohsin Hossieni, said nowhere had it been mentioned in the Shariah that women could not live in separate dormitories and safe places. Such a thing had never been in Islamic Shariah. “The closure of university can inflict a heavy damage on the future and nation of Afghanistan,” he added.

NEW YORK: A fearsome winter storm that pummelled the United States with blinding snow and powerful Arctic winds left 1.7 million people without power on Saturday while thousands of cancelled flights stranded travellers making last-minute dashes for Christmas. 
At least 13 storm-related deaths have been confirmed across six states as heavy snow, howling winds and dangerously frigid temperatures kept much of the nation, including the normally temperate south, in a frozen grip for a third straight day. 
Frigid cold and blowing winds knocked out power and cut energy production across the US, driving up heating and electricity prices. Winter Storm Elliott brought sub-freezing temperatures and extreme weather alerts to about two-thirds of the US, with cold and snow in some areas to linger through the Christmas holiday.
More than 1.7 million homes and businesses lost power, oil refineries in Texas cut gasoline and diesel production on equipment failures, and heating and power prices surged on the losses. 

Over a dozen die; 1.7m homes, businesses face blackouts; air, road travel across several states affected

The “bomb cyclone” winter storm, one of the fiercest in decades, had already forced the cancellation of more than 1,900 US flights on Saturday, a day after nearly 6,000 were scrapped, according to tracking website Flightaware.com. 
Cancellations left stranded travellers at airports including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Detroit and New York hoping for a pre-Christmas flight rebooking miracle. 
In hard-hit New York state, Governor Kathy Hochul deployed the National Guard to Erie County and its main city Buffalo, where authorities said emergency services have essentially collapsed in the face of extreme blizzard conditions. 
Over 200 million Americans were under weather warnings as wind chills sent temperatures plunging to as low as -55 Fahrenheit (-48 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service (NWS). Authorities were warning about lethal conditions and urging residents to remain indoors.

2,Shanghai asks people to stay indoors as Covid surges,Hong Kong announces planned border reopening with China,"SHANGHAI: Shanghai health authorities on Saturday urged residents to stay at home this weekend, seeking a toned-down Christmas in the nation’s most populous city as Covid-19 rages nationwide after tough curbs were lifted.
The Omicron variant is surging weeks after the authorities abruptly ended their zero-Covid policy, lifting strict testing requirements and travel restrictions. While many have welcomed the easing, families and the health system seemed unprepared for the resulting surge of infections. 
Shanghai typically hosts a large Christmas-themed market in a luxury shopping area along Nanjing West Road, and restaurants and retailers offer promotions to drum up business. But the spread of Omicron is dampening celebrations.
People lamented on social media they will be staying inside as many locals have tested positive for Covid. “I originally planned to go to Shanghai for Christmas but now I can only lie in bed,” a person wrote on Weibo, China’s Twitter-like social network.

Hong Kong announces planned border reopening with China

China’s national health authority on Saturday reported 4,128 daily symptomatic Covid-19 infections. Infections in China are likely more than a million a day with deaths at more than 5,000 a day, in “stark contrast” to official data, British-based health data firm Airfinity claimed. A health official in Qingdao said the port city was seeing roughly 500,000 daily infections.
Amid the resurge in Covid-19 cases, China took another step tow­ards loosening its pandemic-related restrictions on Saturday when Hong Kong’s leader announced it would aim to reopen its borders with the mainland by mid-January 2023.
Upon returning from Beijing, Hong Kong chief executive John Lee told a presser that the authorities would aim to “gradually, orderly, and fully” reopen all entry points between the two sides, and coordinate with the government of nearby Shenzhen to manage the flow of people.
At present, individuals hoping to enter the mainland through Hong Kong can only do so through the city’s airport or two checkpoints — Shenzhen Bay or the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge. Entrants into the mainland must also undergo a period of hotel quarantine before they can move about freely.
Hong Kong and Beijing shut their borders in early 2020 when Covid surfaced and they have remained closed since then, as China has capped inbound travellers as part of its strict “zero-Covid” policy.
