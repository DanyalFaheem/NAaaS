1,KP govt to hand over 180 low-performing schools to private organisations,"Officials insist initiative to improve quality of education, enrolment.","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has planned to hand over the operations and management of its low-performing schools to private organisations insisting that the initiative will improve the quality of education, enrolment rates, and governance in those educational institutions.
The elementary and secondary education department has selected 180 government schools in nine districts, including 145 primary and 35 high and higher secondary ones, for the pilot project, reveal official documents.
It has divided those schools in 35 clusters with each cluster having a high or higher secondary school and four or five ‘feeding’ primary schools.
The project is likely to be launched in the next academic year slated to begin in the next September. The government has already allocated Rs1 billion for it in the current fiscal.

Officials insist initiative to improve quality of education, enrolment

The initiative will be executed on the basis of public-private partnership in the selected areas of Abbottabad, Buner, Haripur, Karak, Kohat, Mansehra, Nowshera, Swabi and Swat districts.
“The low-performing schools are those, where literacy and numeracy rate is below 50 per cent compared to the international standard of 80 per cent and which do not give optimal results,” adviser to the education department on public-private partnership Ubaidullah told Dawn.
He said the government would pay to the selected private organisations Rs1,000 for enrolling each student in 145 primary schools and Rs2,000 for students in 45 high and higher secondary schools.
The adviser said the data showed that the government’s average spending on every student of government schools was Rs3,900.
He said an advertisement would be floated in both regional and national newspapers for the selection of private organisations with experience in managing educational institutions.
“The government is keen about partnering with the most proficient private institutions, which have a strong footprint in education sector and are financially sound to facilitate it in carrying out this activity seamlessly as a public-private partnership. It is willing to support private partners in the rehabilitation of schools as per their needs and expectations,” he said.
The documents reveal that the private partners will be required to enrol at least 120 students in each school handed over to them suggesting at least 20 students in a class.
Out of the total amount, the government will pay 65 per cent to the private partner in advance, while the remaining will be paid after the examination of key performance indicators.
Different surveys show millions of children out of schools in the province.
According to the BISP’s National Socio-Economic Registry Census conducted with the help of the elementary and secondary schoolteachers, the children, who don’t go to school in the province, total 4.7 million.
The Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement Survey put the number at 3.6 million.
“To enrol out of school children, government needs over 15,000 primary schools, with the same ratio middle, high and higher secondary schools,” an official of the education department told Dawn.
He insisted that only the construction of required primary schools with the current budget allocations would need the government more than 57 years to materialise the ambitious plan of enrolling currently out-of-school children.
The official said in the current dynamic environment, population of the province was growing exponentially and so were the challenges for the provision of education to the people in line with Article 25A of the Constitution and therefore, policymakers were in dire need of innovative, sustainable, pragmatic and financially viable solutions to address them.
“To enrol all out-of-school children, the public-private partnerships are the viable solution as per the industry’s best practices even in advanced economies. Our project has been designed in a sustainable and scalable way so that this pilot can be up-scaled across the province in the next phase,” he said.

5,Pakistan cannot deviate from Quaid’s stand on Israel: Siraj,Claims Jamaat has a plan to address economic crisis.,"HARIPUR: Jamaat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq has said Pakistan cannot afford to deviate from its policy on Israel that its founder Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had devised during his role as leader of the All India Muslim League and later at the independence of Pakistan.
“How can we change the policy of the founding father of Pakistan towards Israel and follow others,” he said while talking to Dawn after addressing members of the district bar association here on Friday.
Asked if, in the prevailing circumstances, Pakistan should also revisit its foreign policy regarding Israel when some Muslim countries had already recognised the Jewish state and some lobbyists were also tacitly busy urging Pakistan to join others in that regard, Mr Haq replied that Pakistan was the leading Muslim nation in the world and it would not follow others keeping in view the stance that Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had taken for the rights of Arab Muslims, especially Palestinians, before and after the partition of the subcontinent.
To a question about the JI’s governance model, especially the economic policy, the JI chief said his party had a complete programme that could help the country steer out of the prevailing economic and political crises.

Claims Jamaat has a plan to address economic crisis

Earlier, while addressing the lawyers, Mr Haq said Americans and their European allies had taken complete control of the economy, health and politics of the Muslim countries, including Pakistan, through international organisations like the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World Trade Organisation and World Health Organisation, and both ruling and the opposition parties were dancing to their tunes.
He termed the PTI, PML-N and PPP the guardians of status quo and the interests of world powers, and added that they all were grown up in the nurseries of the establishment and caused irreparable loss to the country and disrespected the Constitution of Pakistan.
He said that the constitutions of 1956, 1962 and 1973 had clearly asked the government to ensure Riba-free economy and the Shariat Court had decided the case thrice against Riba, but the government had failed to implement the verdict.
He claimed that after the failure of three mainstream political parties in bringing relief to the general public, the people of Pakistan were left with the only choice of JI, which he said, had the capacity to introduce Islamic system, take the country out of economic crisis and bring real prosperity to the people.
Later, he inaugurated an Aghosh centre in Khalabat Township.

7,PHC sets aside life sentence awarded in murder case,Rules a dying declaration must be verified for conviction,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has set aside the sentence of life awarded to a Bannu resident by the trial court in a murder case and ruled that an accused couldn’t be convicted merely on the basis of a dying declaration until it was verified.
A bench consisting of Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Sahibzada Asadullah accepted the appeal of Issa Khan, who was sentenced by an additional sessions judge in Bannu on Jan 31, 2022, on the basis of a dying declaration by the deceased, Usman.
The bench observed that for the veracity of a dying declaration, the prosecution must establish through reliable evidence that the dying person was in full senses, conscious and alert to the surroundings, was fully oriented in time and space, and was able to make a coherent statement.
It added that the doctor present on the occasion must furnish a fitness certificate about the condition of a dying person.

Rules a dying declaration must be verified for conviction

The bench observed that in the case those ingredients required for a dying declaration had been missing.
It ruled that the prosecution had failed to establish consciousness, alertness and capability of the deceased then injured as to talk and it had also not been proved that the deceased was in full senses while making the statement.
The deceased while recording statement with the police in injured condition in a hospital had charged the appellant for firing at him and had claimed that they had a dispute over money.
In a 22-page detailed judgement authored by Justice Sahibzada Asadullah, the bench discussed different requirements for a dying declaration to be admissible as evidence in a murder case.
“Recording of dying declaration being an important task, so utmost care is required to be taken while recording such declaration. If a dying declaration is recorded carefully, keeping in mind its essential ingredients, such declaration retains its full value,” it observed.
The court added that in the earlier days, the statement of a dying man was looked into with honour and there was a concept behind the statement so recorded that a dying man will not tell a lie, by the time, no need was felt for its corroboration.
It, however, observed that with the passage of time, the values changed and morality degraded to a greater extent, so need was felt to look for independent corroboration.
“It was noteworthy that the declarant giving a dying declaration was in a fit condition of mind to give the statement when recording was started and remained in fit condition of mind, until the recording of dying declaration was completed.
“The fact of fit condition of mind of declarant can be best certified by the doctor, yet in case where it was not possible to take fitness certificate from the doctor, dying declaration still retains its sanctity, if there are other witnesses to testify that the declarant was in fit condition of the mind,” it maintained.
The bench also observed that the dying statement should not be under the influence of anybody or prepared by prompting, tutoring or imagination.
