0,Tokyo to host 2025 world athletics,"Nairobi, Silesia and Singapore had also bid for the championships, while Budapest will host the 2023 version.","EUGENE: Tokyo has been selected as host city for the 2025 World Athletics Championships, the sport’s governing body announced on Thursday a day before this year’s event begins in Eugene, Oregon a year later than planned due to Covid-19.
The event will return to the site of last year’s Olympic Games in the year that the Japanese Association of Athletics Federations (JAAF) celebrates its centenary.
Nairobi, Silesia and Singapore had also bid for the championships, while Budapest will host the 2023 version.
“Within an extremely strong field of candidates Tokyo offered a compelling bid,” World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said after the decision of WA’s ruling Council.
“I hope this will be a shining light for Japan as they celebrate 100 years of the JAAF in 2025, by bringing world-class athletics back to the people in Tokyo.”
Tokyo held the event in 1991, highlighted by the incredible world-record breaking long jump duel between gold medallist Mike Powell and Carl Lewis, while it was also held in Japan in 2007 with Osaka hosting.
The Council also confirmed that following next years World Athletics Cross Country Championships in Bathurst, Australia, the next two editions will be held in Medulin and Pula, Croatia (2024) and Tallahassee, Florida (2026).

1,World Athletics Championship organisers scrambling to fix visa issues,EUGENE: Organisers of the World Athletics Championships were desperately trying to help clear a visa issuing logjam...,"EUGENE: Organisers of the World Athletics Championships were desperately trying to help clear a visa issuing logjam that is threatening to prevent around 100 athletes, coaches and officials from entering the United States for the event that started on Friday.
Dozens of athletes from around the world have been flagging their problems, with Kenyan sprinter Ferdinand Omanyala among the most high-profile.
Omanyala finally got his visa approved but now faces a race to arrive in Eugene in time for Friday’s 100-metre heats. Fellow Kenyan Sheila Chepkirui, due to race the 10,000 metres on Saturday, said that her US visa was approved in May but that she still did not have the stamp in her passport.  “Tears and pain. Silence,” she wrote on Instagram.
Several others have received late approval but will now arrive on the day of their races -- hardly ideal preparation for the sport’s biggest event outside the Olympics.
American former world champion sprinter Michael Johnson tweeted:  “This would never happen in a truly professional sport.”
World Athletics (WA) said on Thursday that 255 of 374 outstanding visa cases had been resolved after being escalated to a joint group comprising USOPC, Oregon22 and World Athletics. Another 20 have been refused and around 100 are still to be resolved, with many of them expected to fail.
“We won’t be 100 percent satisfied unless we had 100 percent of the athletes here. That is not something that we will probably be able to achieve but that is what we strive for,” USATF COO Renee Washington told a news conference following a WA Council meeting.
“Of the 5,500 participants that needed visas, less than one percent have yet to be resolved.”
One of the complications for this event is that WA left the window for qualification open until very close to the start in order to give athletes more chance to find competitions due to the impact of Covid on events. It means that many have had to start the visa application process relatively late. WA president Seb Coe said:  “In percentage terms it’s a small number, but that’s of no comfort if you are in that category.
“We will work right up to the last minute but this is a very complicated multi-faceted landscape. There isn’t one thing that is the dominant problem. Sometimes it’s a staffing issue, some people are struggling to get face to face interviews. There are political complications as well about nations being able to travel into the US.”
Visa issues aside, Coe described the first World Athletics Championships to be held in the US as very exciting.
“The US has consistently been the powerhouse of track and field,” he said.  “We want lots of people in the stadium but this is the largest sports market in the world and there are some really powerful assets in the US in terms of promoting the sport.
“At high school level it is the most participated sport and there are 50 million recreational runners in this country. The challenge is to form that really clear connection between what they are doing and believing that they’re a part of the track and field landscape.
“We have a really collaborative process with USATF and we now have a glide path into the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games. So it is exciting to be here, but we’re also here on a mission too.”

2,Babar expects spin battle in first Sri Lanka Test,GALLE: Pakistan captain Babar Azam said he expects spin to dominate the two-Test series against Sri Lanka which ...,"GALLE: Pakistan captain Babar Azam said he expects spin to dominate the two-Test series against Sri Lanka which opens with the first game at  Galle from Saturday. 
Dimuth Karunaratne’s Sri Lanka, meanwhile, will be looking to build on their winning momentum at Galle with cricket having been a welcome distraction around the island nation’s political unrest and unprecedented economic crisis. 
Sri Lanka head into the series after two contrasting results in Galle where they first lost to Australia on a vicious turner and then bounced back to hammer the tourists on Monday.
“It is a typical spinning wicket and that’s what we saw in the series against Australia,” Babar said during the pre-match press conference on Friday with Pakistan having brought back veteran spinner Yasir Shah for the series. 
“Any team would be difficult at home as they know the conditions,” he added.  “They have some experienced spinners in their side, so we are looking forward to play good cricket against them.” 
Babar praised the 36-year-old Yasir, who claimed 24 wickets in the team’s previous Test win in Sri Lanka seven years ago, for making a comeback.

“Definitely he has made a good comeback and the way he has prepared and worked on his fitness,” said Babar. “The way he bowled in Rawalpindi and then in the practice game in Colombo was good. He is an experienced bowler and will be tough for the opposition.” 
With Yasir set to play his first Test since August 2021, Pakistan announced later on Friday that all-rounders Mohammad Nawaz and Salman Ali Agha will also be part of the playing XI. 
While Nawaz, primarily a spinner, last played a Test in November 2016, Salman will make his Test debut on the back of strong domestic performances. The 28-year-old is a batter who bowls off-spin. 
Babar also shared that the tourists were being looked after really well by Sri Lanka Cricket and  security forces amid country-wide protests following political unrest. 
Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickrem­esinghe, who is the acting President, declared Emer­gency in the island nation as protests grew hours after it emerged that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa had fled the country. 
“We didn’t feel unsafe here because we have been looked after so well by Sri Lanka Cricket and security forces,” Babar said. “We also played a warm-up game here and there weren’t any hurdles that made us feel unsafe. So, I think we should now focus on just our game.” 
Babar has been in roaring form with the bat and recently hit 196 against Australia in the team’s home series, which they ended up losing 1-0 in March. 
Openers Abdullah Shafique and Imam-ul-Haq have also been among the runs while Pakistan boast a dangerous bowling attack led by ace quick Shaheen Shah Afridi. 
Sri Lankan skipper Karunaratne admitted Pakistan will be tougher opposition than Australia in the two Tests but believes playing in Galle for the third straight time will be an advantage for the hosts. 
“They’re a different team. Good against spin as well,” Karunaratne said on Friday. “Previously, they have done pretty good in the Test level. We have to do our basics well if we want to keep them restricted.”  
Karunaratne informed that Dhananjaya de Silva will return to the team after recovering from Covid-19. 
De Silva, a batting all-rounder who was one of four players to get the  virus before and during the second Test against Australia. 
De Silva replaces Kamindu Mendis, who made an impressive 61 on debut in the previous match. 
“Oshada Fernando will open the innings with me. Dhananjaya De Silva takes his place back and we’ll have to look again who is batting at five and six,” Karunaratne said. “I mean Dhananjaya or [Dinesh] Chandimal. Because Chandi is in good form after playing at number five.” 
Chandimal hit an unbeaten 206 before left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya returned a match haul of 12 wickets on debut as the hosts beat Australia by an innings and 39 runs to end the series level at 1-1. 
Crucial World Test Championship points will be on offer in the series, with Sri Lanka moving to third place after the Australia win and Pakistan at four in the current table. 
“It’s good to see that we’re higher up after playing a good series,” said Karun­aratne. “If we can win both Test matches, we have a good chance of playing in the WTC final [next year].  But I am trying to play one by one.” 
Teams: 
SRI LANKA’S 12: Oshada Fernando, Dimuth Karunaratne (capt), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal, Dhananjaya de Silva, Niroshan Dickwella (wk), Ramesh Mendis, Maheesh Theekshana, Prabath Jayasuriya, Kasun Rajitha, Asitha Fernando.

3,Australian Smith hits the front as emotional Woods bows out,"""I think the next one comes around in 2030 and I don’t know if I will be physically able to play by then,"" says Woods.","ST ANDREWS: Australian Cameron Smith made a fast start to lead the British Open midway through the second round as Tiger Woods’ challenge fizzled out meekly at St Andrews on Friday. 
Smith picked up five birdies on the front nine to get to 10 under par, a shot ahead of Americans Dustin Johnson and overnight leader Cameron Young. 
World number one Scottie Scheffler was another stroke back alongside Briton Tyrrell Hatton. 
Woods needed a huge improvement on his opening 78 to make the cut at the venue of two of his three Open titles. 
The American 15-times major champion, continuing his comeback from serious injuries sustained in a car crash last year, flickered into life with a birdie at the third before two bogeys quickly halted his momentum. 
He played steadily on the back nine until finding a bunker on the 16th and the ensuing double-bogey took the 46-year-old to nine over par, ending any faint hopes he had of returning at the weekend. 
Woods received a standing ovation from the galleries as he walked up the 18th fairway before he missed a short birdie putt to complete a round of 75 that left him tied for 150th place in the 156-man field. 
“It’s very emotional for me,” Woods told reporters. “I’ve been coming here since 1995. I think the next one comes around in 2030 and I don’t know if I will be physically able to play by then. 
“My two-day play is I made my share of mistakes,” he added. “Struggled again today to get the feel of the greens.” 
Twice major champion Johnson, who recently defected to the breakaway LIV series, shot a composed 67, recovering from a bogey at the first to ride a hot putter and make six birdies. 
“I thought I played really nicely, just drove it well, hit a lot of quality iron shots, gave myself a lot of looks at birdie,” Johnson told reporters. “Obviously, if you look at the history of the tournament, it’s a trophy I would love to have in the office when I’m done with my golf career.” 
Johnson, who quit the PGA Tour last month to join the controversial Saudi-backed series, will be hoping to avoid any repeat of the last Open at St Andrews in 2015, when he led at the halfway stage on 10-under but a third-round 75 ended his hopes of victory. 
“To be honest, I don’t even remember the third round from seven years ago. I’ve played a lot of golf since then, and that was a long time ago,” he insisted before claiming he was oblivious to criticism of the LIV rebels. 
“I don’t read anything. So I wouldn’t know what you were saying or if there was anything negative being said. I don’t pay attention to it.” 
Scheffler also bogeyed the first but soon rediscovered his usual smooth rhythm to conjure up four birdies around the turn before signing for a second successive 68. 
“Yesterday, I played pretty fantastic to shoot four-under,” he said. “It was playing so difficult yesterday in the afternoon. This morning it was tough getting started.” 
Young, who started with a superb 64 on his Open debut, dropped a shot at the first before picking up two birdies to revive his challenge. 
Hatton moved into contention with a flawless round of 66 to finish one ahead of Americans Talor Gooch, Patrick Cantlay and Sahith Theegala, and Australian Adam Scott, the former Masters champion who tore up the Old Course with a sparkling 65. 
“We’ve caught a lot of flak for what we’ve done here recently,” said Gooch when asked about the performances of his fellow LIV players. “I think one thing that cannot be questioned is the quality of players that are there.” 
There are 24 players from the LIV series in St Andrews this week, and the landmark staging of the world’s oldest golf tournament has to some extent been overshadowed by the new tour, which R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers blasted for being  “entirely driven by money”. 
LIV offers prize money of $25 million for each 54-hole event, compared to a $14 million prize pot for this week’s Open. 
Rory McIlroy, who came into the week as the favourite, sat in second place overnight after an opening 66. 
The Northern Irishman, Open champion at Hoylake in 2014, started his second round at 2:59pm (1359 GMT) on Friday. 
US Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick, playing with Woods, shot a 66 to move to six-under overall.

4,Pakistan skipper Babar Azam backs Kohli to overcome batting slump,"Kohli ""needs support and as a player, I tweeted to support him"", says Babar","GALLE: Pakistan skipper Babar Azam on Friday said India’s Virat Kohli remains one of the best players in world cricket despite his prolonged slump and should get all the support he needs to regain his batting form.
Kohli, who has been rested for the upcoming One day International and Twenty20 series in West Indies, has not hit a century since 2019 and has been under fire for his extended lean patch, with questions being raised over his future.
But Babar on Thursday tweeted a picture of the two sporting rivals captioned  “This too shall pass. Stay Strong”, which went viral as fans praised the Pakistan batsman for backing the former India captain.

 





 
“As a player (tough) times can fall on you as well,” Babar  said ahead of his side’s opening Test in Sri Lanka.
“I know how a player goes through such times and how he comes out of it. So he needs support in those times and as a player I tweeted to support him.” 
Babar, who is often compared to Kohli for his prolific run-scoring, added:  “He is one of the best player and he knows how to come out this. It takes time but we should back him.” Former cricketers including Kapil Dev have said Kohli should be dropped and youngsters given a chance to prove their worth in a competitive Indian team. India captain Rohit Sharma, however, has backed his senior batsman to bounce back soon.
“He has been such a great batsman, he doesn’t need reassurances,” Rohit said after his team’s ODI loss to England on Thursday.
“Form does go up and down, it’s part (and) parcel of a player’s life. It’s just a matter of one or two innings” for Kohli, he added.
Sourav Ganguly, president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, said Kohli  “has got to find his way” to score runs again.
Many former players, including Ashish Nehra, believe the star batsman should take a prolonged break to get his batting mojo back.
Kohli, who has hit 27 centuries in 102 Tests since making his debut in 2011, has endured a torrid 12 months that also saw him replaced as India’s captain.

England had won only one of their previous 17 tests when the new leadership, including Key himself, was put in charge to script a turnaround.
England have since blanked world Test champions New Zealand 3-0 and beat India in Edgbaston, particularly impressive was how they chased down 270-plus targets in all four matches.
“I never thought it would work like this,” Key told BBC Test Match Special. “There will be times when it won’t work, but for now it’s been fantastic to see.”
Key, however, felt the term ‘Bazball’ did not do justice to the hard work put in by McCullum and Stokes.
“I’m not mad on Bazball the phrase,” he said. “It’s not something I particularly enjoy because it devalues what Ben and Brendon have done.”
Key said appointing McCu­llum was a gamble considering the former New Zealand captain had no red-ball coaching experience bef­ore taking up the England job.
“I saw it as though I had two choices,” Key said. “Did the England team, the Test team in particular, need someone who was going to be like a drill sergeant, a real hard taskmaster who’s going to be really tough on them and try and drive them in that way?
“I felt they needed someone to just take the pressure off them a little bit. I wanted someone who, with the talented players that we had, just freed them up a bit and got them out there to be the best players they possibly can be.”

6,"Danish double as Pedersen, Vingegaard turn up Tour heat",ST ETIENNE: Mads Pedersen became the third Dane to win a stage on this year’s Tour de France when an escape group...,"ST ETIENNE: Mads Pedersen became the third Dane to win a stage on this year’s Tour de France when an escape group beat the peloton to Saint-Etienne on a baking-hot dash across the Rhone Valley on Friday as riders braced to face temperatures of up to 40 degrees this weekend.
His countryman Jonas Vingegaard retained the overall lead, which he claimed by winning stage 11, while Magnus Cort Nielsen won stage 10 in a Tour de France that had started with three days in Denmark.
A bunch sprint had been expected on this 193km Stage 13 run from the foot of the Alps but as the heavier built riders, who dominate the sprints, began to struggle in the searing temperatures, a seven-rider break began to dream of a stage win.
Australian sprinter Caleb Ewan fell when he appeared to lose focus and braked hard into a corner, tumbling alone near the head of the peloton.
Quick-Step sprinter Fabio Jakobsen was also dropped as the pack chased the escape and with no collective will to reel in the escape the peloton then gave up the game 25km from Saint-Etienne.
Pedersen is clearly a man for the extremes as he won the 2019 world championship road race in freezing Yorkshire rain.
On Friday, he dealt with a heatwave with the same elan, whipping his rivals Hugo Houle and Fred Wright in the home straight.
“It was a bit of a gamble,” the 26-year-old Pedersen said after his first ever Grand Tour win.
“I had a couple of good days in the mountains, my legs felt good, so when it came to the sprint I had enough.”
Vingegaard, Tadej Pogacar and Geraint Thomas, the top three in the overall standings, all cruised over the line together.
“It’s great to be a Dane right now, a third win for Denmark is incredible,” said Vingegaard.
Pedersen said the Danish success was down to grass roots investment in a country where five times more journeys are made by bike than by car.
“All the good work from local and continental teams and investment in Danish cycling is paying off,” he said.
Much has been made of how Jumbo riders have been wearing cooling jackets ahead of the stages as the heatwave builds up.
They are the only team using such jackets.
“Regular cold drinks and ice packs on the back as often as you can during the race to keep the body temperature down, that’s what you do,” said Vingegaard.
“I wouldn’t say the heat was a problem,” said the man who was cheered round the streets of Copenhagen by tens of thousands of rain-poncho wearing spectators two weeks ago.
The heatwave in France will continue to build over the next couple of days with temperatures expected to edge towards 40 degrees.

Potts has impressed for England’s Test team this year after recovering from several injuries.
The Durham fast bowler has played all four Tests under new captain Ben Stokes, taking 18 wickets at an average 26.72 during England’s winning run against New Zealand and India.
Despite making just 10 List A appearances at domestic level, the 23-year-old has been handed his chance to take on the Proteas.
England, who face India in an ODI series decider at Old Trafford on Sunday, begin their next limited-over series just 48 hours later at Potts’ home ground of Chester-le-Street.
Another change sees first-choice leg-spinner Adil Rashid return for both the 50 and 20-over squads in place of Matt Parkinson, following his return from the Hajj pilgrimage to Makkah.
Parkinson took one wicket in two appearances in Rashid’s absence but continues to be viewed as a back-up option across the formats.
Jonny Bairstow is restored to the T20 setup after missing out against India due to his exploits in the Test side, but left-arm quick Tymal Mills is absent.
Stokes is once again rested from the T20 games as part of his ongoing workload management and the England and Wales Cricket Board also confirmed he would not be available for Northern Superchargers at the start of this year’s Hundred tournament.
The six matches against South Africa take place from July 19-31.

8,Record-breaker Topley strikes as England rout India to level ODI series,LONDON: Reece Topley said returning England’s best One-day International bowling figures during a 100-run rout of...,"LONDON: Reece Topley said returning England’s best One-day International bowling figures during a 100-run rout of India at Lord’s on Thursday had made years ravaged by injury “worthwhile”. 
The 28-year-old took an outstanding 6-24 as 50-over world champions England, defending a seemingly modest 246, bounced back from their humiliating 10-wicket defeat at the Oval on Tuesday to level this three-match series at 1-1 ahead of Sunday’s decider at Old Trafford. 
Topley made his international debut back in 2015 but four years of his career have been blighted by injuries, with the paceman suffering four separate stress fractures of his back. 
“It means a lot, it makes it all worthwhile to be honest,” said Topley. 
His father, Don, found fame when as a substitute fielder during a 1984 Test against the West Indies at Lord’s he held a brilliant catch on the boundary off a Malcolm Marshall hook only to step over the rope and concede a six instead. 
Reece’s efforts mean the Topley name will now be known for rather more than that at the ‘Home of Cricket’, with the paceman determined to make the most of his international career. 
“It is everyone’s dream to play for England,” he said. “I just want to pull the shirt on as many times as I can and play my part. It is a privilege every time. 
“It was a terrific team performance to bounce back from defeat the other day and I’m just happy that I played my part.” 
Topley’s return was built on maintaining a challenging line and length, with his return surpassing current assistant coach Paul Collingwood’s previous England ODI best of 6-31 against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge that had stood for 17 years. 
England captain Jos Buttler, well-placed to assess Topley’s bowling from his position as wicketkeeper, said: “He’s a very popular member of the team and I’m delighted for him. 
“He’s had quite an interesting story. For him to come back from that and to take 6-24 at Lord’s is an incredibly special performance. It’s a tribute to his perseverance and his outlook on life and the game.” 
England, skittled out for 110 at the Oval, were in danger of another meagre total at 102-5 before Moeen Ali, who top-scored with 47, shared useful stands with Liam Livingstone and David Willey. 
On a wicket that had eased up after the first innings, India never found their stride and folded for 146 in 38.5 overs. 
Topley landed a double blow early in the chase by getting rid of opposition captain Rohit Sharma (0) and Shikhar Dhawan (9) before Virat Kohli (16), returning from a groin strain, edged behind off David Willey after a fluent start. 
Suryakumar Yadav (27) and Hardik Pandya (29) flickered briefly but failed to kick on after promising starts. 
All hopes of an unlikely India win evaporated when Ravindra Jadeja was removed by Liam Livingstone for 29 as England sealed an easy win, three years to the day after they beat New Zealand in a dramatic finish to lift the 50-over World Cup at the venue.

9,CAS upholds ban on Russian football clubs,PARIS: The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday upheld the ban on Russian clubs from European competitions...,"PARIS: The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) on Friday upheld the ban on Russian clubs from European competitions for the coming season and Russia’s exclusion from international tournaments, as a result of the war in Ukraine.
CAS rejected appeals by four Russian clubs against their banishment by UEFA from European competitions in 2022-2023 and another by the Russian Football Federation which contested its exclusion from all competitions organised by FIFA and UEFA.
“The escalation of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the public and government responses worldwide, created unforeseen and unprecedented circumstances to which FIFA and UEFA had to respond,” the Lausanne-based CAS said in its press release.
“In determining that Russian teams and clubs should not participate in competitions under their aegis while such circumstances persisted, the panel (of judges) held that both parties acted within the scope of the discretion granted to them under their respective statutes and regulations.” Russian clubs and national teams were initially suspended  “until further notice” by UEFA in February in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine.
In early May, UEFA announced that  “no Russian club” would participate in the 2022-2023 season of European club competitions, namely the Champions League, the Europa League or the Europa Conference League.
Zenit Saint Petersburg, who were denied a place in the group stages of the Champions League because of the ban, CSKA Moscow, Dynamo Moscow and Sochi all challenged the decision.
Russia’s national team was kicked out of the qualifying competition for this year’s World Cup in Qatar by FIFA just before a crucial play-off tie against Poland in March.
Russia were also excluded from the Women’s European Championship currently taking place in England and will play no further part in the qualifying campaign for the 2023 Women’s World Cup.
“The panel finds it unfortunate that the current military operations in Ukraine, for which Russian football teams, clubs, and players have themselves no responsibility, had, by reason of the decisions of FIFA and UEFA, such an adverse effect on them and Russian football generally, but those effects were... offset by the need for the secure and orderly conduct of football events for the rest of the world,” said CAS.

Zimbabwe beat Papua New Guinea by 27 runs after posting 199-5 in 20 overs, then restricting their opponents to 172-8.
The Netherlands defeated the US by seven wickets. Replying to an American total of 138 in 19.4 overs, the Dutch scored 139-3 with six balls to spare.
Australia, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, England, India, Ireland, Namibia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Scotland, South Africa, Sri Lanka, the UAE and the West Indies had already secured places.
The 16-team tournament runs from Oct 16 to Nov 13 with Australia defending a title they won in the UAE last year.
Winning the toss and opting to bat, Zimbabwe clicked with six batsmen led by Wesley Madhevere scoring at least 22 runs.
Madhevere top scored with 42, including five fours, and added 63 runs for the second wicket with captain Craig Ervine.
Papua New Guinea, who scraped into the semi-finals on net run rate after winning only one of three group matches, were close to matching the Zimbabwe run-rate for much of the innings with Tony Ura starring.
But when Ura fell off the final ball of the 14th, after notching 66, including five sixes and four fours off 35 balls, the island nation lost momentum.
Blessing Muzarabani was the most succesful Zimbabwe bowler, taking two wickets at the expense of 24 runs in four overs.
Zimbabwe, who appointed former star batsman Dave Houghton as coach just before the tournament, will be making a fifth appearance at the T20 finals.
In the other semi-final, captain Monank Patel top scored for the US with 32 and Steven Taylor, their star batsman in the group stage, contributed 26.
Bas de Leede and Paul van Meekeren took two wickets each, but Fred Klaassen, who captured five wickets against Uganda on Thursday, had a disappointing 0-40 four-over stint.
After impressing with the ball, De Leede did even better with the bat, striking an unbeaten 91, including three sixes and nine fours.
Captain and wicket-keeper Scott Edwards weighed in with a run-a-ball 26 to ensure a fourth consecutive appearance at the T20 World Cup tournament for the Dutch.
In placement play-offs, there were victories for Uganda over Jersey and Hong Kong against Singapore, the only team not win so far in Bulawayo.

12,Christian Eriksen joins United on free transfer,He is United’s second recruit in the close season under new Dutch manager Erik ten Hag.,"MANCHESTER: Manchester United have signed Christian Eriksen on a free transfer with the Danish playmaker signing a three-year deal, the Premier League club announced on Friday.
Eriksen, who needed life-saving treatment on the pitch last year when he suffered a near-fatal cardiac arrest in a European Championship match against Finland in June, returned to action with Brentford after signing a short-term deal in January.
Eriksen is United’s second recruit in the close season under new Dutch manager Erik ten Hag after the club signed Dutch left back Tyrell Malacia.
“Manchester United is a special club and I cannot wait to get started. I have had the privilege of playing at Old Trafford many times but to do it in the red shirt of United will be an amazing feeling,” Eriksen said in a statement.
“I have seen Erik’s work at Ajax and know the level of detail and preparation that he and his staff put into every day. It is clear that he is a fantastic coach.
“Having spoken with him and learned more about his vision and the way he wants the team to play, I am even more excited for the future.”  Eriksen was an Inter Milan player when he collapsed and underwent surgery to be fitted with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) device — which is not permitted in the Italian Serie A — leading to the termination of his contract.
After signing for Brentford, he made 11 league appearances under Danish coach Thomas Frank, scoring a goal and providing four assists as Brentford finished 13th in their first season in the Premier League.
He is no stranger to the Premier League, however, having spent nearly seven seasons with Tottenham Hotspur, making more than 300 appearances in all competitions for the London side.
He also resumed his Denmark career, scoring against Serbia on his return to the Parken Stadium where he had collapsed.
“I still have major ambitions in the game, there is a huge amount that I know I can achieve, and this is the perfect place to continue my journey,” Eriksen added.
