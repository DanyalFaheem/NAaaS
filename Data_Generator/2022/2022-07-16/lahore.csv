0,LHC directs ECP to hold by-polls as per SC orders,LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Friday directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold July 17...,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Friday directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold July 17 by-elections in Punjab on 20 seats of the provincial assembly strictly   in the light of the Supreme Court’s directions.
Justice Sajid Mahmood Sethi passed the direction disposing of two petitions challenging the alleged changes in the voter lists by the ECP, one of these filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Punjab president Dr Yasmin Rashid and the other by a citizen, Munir Ahmad, through Advocate Azhar Siddique.
Punjab Election Commissioner Saeed Gull told the court the by-polls would be held as per the voters’ list finalised on May 25, 2022. He said the date of June 2, 2022 was mistakenly printed on the final voters’ list, which was later rectified. He said all complaints regarding the vote registration had been addressed as per the law.
The election commissioner also filed a written reply to the petitions, denying the charges leveled by the petitioners.  
The reply said the contention in the petitions was false and baseless and liable to be dismissed.
Earlier, the petitioners’ counsel argued that the ECP made fictitious entries in the voter lists and showed dead voters as alive to benefit a particular political party. He said the ECP was duty bound to hold the elections in a transparent and fair manner.
He asked the court to order the ECP to ensure that no rigging or misappropriation was committed in the by-elections.

1,Children’s torture case: probe reveals a sordid tale of faith exploitation,"Police arrest prime suspect, recover seven-year-old girl.","LAHORE: The police investigations into the torture case of two children working as domestic help in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) here revealed that their employer wanted to marry their seven-year-old sister, who has been recovered by police from the prime suspect (the employer).  
One of the children, 10-year-old Kamran, had succumbed to the injuries inflicted by the employers, while his younger sibling, Rizwan (6), was injured by them.
On Friday, the police arrested the prime suspect, Abul Hassan, in a raid carried out in Bahawalpur district, also recovering a 7-year-old girl ‘A’, who turned out to be sister of the two children.
The investigations also revealed that Abul Hassan claimed to be a Pir (spiritual healer), and the children’s father Irfan, a resident of Hyderabad, Sindh, used to visit him. 
Lahore Investigation DIG Kamran Adil told Dawn the prime suspect Abul Hassan was himself a follower of a so-called spiritual healer living in Dera Ghazi Khan.
He said Hassan had told Irfan that his Pir (in DG Khan) wanted him to marry an underage girl.  
At this, Irfan showed his willingness to ‘sacrifice’ his minor daughter and handed ‘A’ over to Hassan in a “spiritual ceremony” organised at the house of the prime suspect, the DIG said.
He said these details got revealed when the police managed to get recording of mobile phone conversations between Hassan and the man (Pir) living in DG Khan.
The DIG said the police actually came to know about the sister of the two boys through these phone call recordings.
He said following the information, he formed a police team to recover the girl, while making the telephonic evidence a part of the investigation.
He said the team traced the location of Hassan in Bahawalpur, where he was hiding to avoid arrest.
In the entire episode, the DIG said, the role of the children’s father was shocking as he neither contacted police to lodge a case against their employers, nor pursued investigation process.
He said the police, on their own, moved the local magistrate, seeking orders for the postmortem examination of the deceased boy and permission for his burial. “We have traced the location of children’s father who was staying somewhere in Hyderabad,"" the police officer said.
He said a human trafficking case would also be lodged against the father for selling his minor daughter to Hassan.
To a question, the DIG said, the prime suspect had claimed that ‘A’ was 13 years old, but the documentary evidences, including National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) record, showed she was not more than seven.
He said police were also trying to confirm Hassan’s marital status.
To another question, he said, the prime suspect was addicted to ice drug and seemed to be a psychopath.
“We have also requested the University of Health Sciences (UHS) Lahore to engage a team of senior psychologists for the case,” the DIG said.

3,Yasmin demands ECP act on voters’ lists complaints,Commission says plaints unfounded,"LAHORE:  Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf central Punjab president Dr Yasmin Rashid has  demanded the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) fulfil its duties by  acting on her evidence-supported complaint about the unprecedented  increase in voters in two union councils of the PP-167 as well as  removal of votes from the voters’ lists, declaring people dead. 
Speaking  at a press conference at a PTI office on Friday, Dr Rashid said the  election commissioner replied that it was the mistake of the National  Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to declare millions of  people dead. She said she had also presented a petition before the  election commission that polling agents belonging to other  constituencies should be allowed to be deputed. She said it took nine  days to pursue the commission and eventually the high court admonished  the election commissioner to allow deputing polling agents from other  constituencies. 
Ms Rashid alleged that Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah was using police to harass the PTI workers.  
“We are not afraid of state terrorism and will fight at every forum,” she declared. 

Commission says plaints unfounded

She  also revealed that she had received calls from ‘no caller’ IDs and the  caller posing as an official of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB)  who leveled corruption charges against her. “I asked him to send me a  notice and (I) will duly reply,” she said. 
Dr Rashid said the  election commissioner should take notice of development work being  carried out by the PML-N government in by-election constituencies.  
Punjab Election Commissioner Saeed Gul, replying  to a question about alleged bogus entries in the voters’ list, clarified the PTI was confusing the voters’ list being prepared for 2023  general election which remained on display till June 30 with the ones  finalised in 2020. He said additions and deletions to old lists were made till May  25 this year when the election schedule for the by-polls for 20 seats  was announced.

He said the ECP secretary would remain in Lahore to personally monitor the by-polls in four constituencies, while the Chief Election Commissioner and members of the commission would be manning the central control room at Islamabad.  
Responding to a query about PTI’s allegation that “Mr X was overseeing a rigging plan”, Gul said he knew about X and Y only in mathematical equations and that Imran Khan would be in a better position to identify that person.
About the federal and provincial ministers resigning from their offices only to take part in the election campaign and then again most likely to take oath of their offices, the provincial election commissioner said the authority could not do anything about it because the election code of conduct was finalised in consultation with the political parties.  
He told a questioner that the commission had sought TV footage from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) about the public meetings and media talks in which the PTI leadership levelled unfounded allegations against the ECP for taking a legal action.  
Replying to a question about alleged bogus entries in the voters list, he clarified the PTI was confusing the voters list being prepared for 2023 general election and remained on display till June 30 with the ones finalised in 2020 but additions and deletions were made to them till May 25 this year when the election schedule for the by-polls for 20 seats was announced.
He said SMS 8300 service had been activated for the voters to know their polling station.

Justice Farooq Haider also sought a written report from the ACE on the petition of Rashid.
The ACE accused him of misappropriation of millions of rupees on account of fee in the sale of state land to Royal Residencia Islamabad Housing Society. The agency also summoned him and the housing society administration for investigation.  
Rashid appeared before the court along with his counsel Azhar Siddique. The counsel argued that the petitioner did not violate any law in execution of the sale agreement. He claimed to have private holdings and lands fully declared in tax documents.
He said the petitioner had a sale agreement of land measuring 149 kanals situated in Attock against a sum of Rs670 million with a private housing society and received Rs100m as advance payment. The remaining amount was supposed to be received at the time of transfer of the land within a period of one year.
He asked the court to set aside the call-up notice issued to him by the ACE and restrain the agency from causing any harassment to him.  
The judge restrained the ACE from taking coercive measures against the petitioner and sought a reply by July 27.
Rashid told the media that the ACE issued him the notice at the behest of interior minister Rana Sanaullah. He dared the government to initiate proceedings of treason under Article 6 of the Constitution against PTI leaders. 
He said the Supreme Court did not ask for proceedings under Article 6 but the government was misleading the nation.  
Rashid said the politics of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would end the day he spoke the truth.

11,Govt to pay Rs334m annually to contract teachers,"SAHIWAL: The Higher Education Department, on the direction of the chief secretary, has calculated the ‘financial...","SAHIWAL: The Higher Education Department, on the direction of the chief secretary, has calculated the ‘financial implication’ and individual benefits to lecturers and assistant  professors of four contract batches and 500 commerce teachers. 
The four batches of academics are of 2002, 2005, 2009 and 2012.  
Sources told Dawn that the government had worked out the cost of payments to contract batches to be around Rs334 million per annum. The Punjab government had already allocated funds for disbursement of the ‘pay protection’ amount among 6,500 public and commerce college teachers.  
DPI Colleges, Lahore, Dr Ashiq Hussain told Dawn over phone that the individual data of four contract batches under the direction of HED letter No SO (B&F) MISC-40/2021-22 of July 7 had been finalised and sent to the authorities concerned.  
Chaudhry Ghulam Murtaza, convener of the Punjab Professors and Lecturers Association’s (PPLA)  Pay Protection Committee (PPC), confirmed that the chief secretary office had approved the demands of the teachers who organised a 37-day sit-in (March 7 to April 12) outside the Civil Secretariat. 
According to PPLA Punjab Additional Secretary Faiza Raana, the HED’s Budget and Finance Wing had calculated the amounts on an individual basis and consolidated the figures.  
Sources said the HED, the provincial law department and the S&GAD (Regulation Wing) had earlier worked out the financial impact on a collective basis but the chief secretary office sought details of individuals this time round.  
Around 6,000 public sector teachers and 500 commerce college teachers were inducted on a contract during Musharraf regime. Later, the PPP’s federal government in 2008 abolished the contract system and formed a federal policy. At that time, Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not implement the federal policy in Punjab while the other three provinces regularised their contract employees.  
The matter became a bone of contention among stakeholders and many teachers moved courts against the non-implementation of the federal government policy. Subsequently, the Punjab government regularised contract teachers of four batches after a gap of five to seven years. Those of 2002 and 2005 were regularised in 2009 and the employees of the 2009 and 2012 batches were regularised in 2012 and 2015, respectively.  
Murtaza said although the teachers were regularised, their “pay was not protected” at that time. The PPLA organised two major protests -- first for five days in front of the Punjab Assembly in 2019 and the other for 37 days outside the Civil Secretariat in 2022. 
He said it had been a longstanding demand of the PPLA and Rs334  million per annum was a minor amount, demanding that the chief secretary ensure pay protection  of the teachers.
