0,Egypt to suspend role in UN peace operations in Mali,BAMAKO: Egypt will “temporarily suspend” its participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations in Mali...,"BAMAKO: Egypt will “temporarily suspend” its participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations in Mali after seven of its troops died in attacks this year, the UN mission MINUSMA said on Friday.
Egypt signalled its concerns at UN headquarters in New York this week, the mission said in a statement.
“We have been informed that, in consequence, the Egyptian contingent would temporarily suspend its activities in MINUSMA from August 15,” said the statement, without detailing how long the suspension would last.
MINUSMA -- the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali -- was launched in 2013 to help one of the world’s poorest countries cope with a bloody campaign.
It is one of the UN’s biggest peacekeeping operations, with 17,609 troops, police, civilians and volunteers deployed as of April, according to the mission’s website.
It is also one of the most dangerous UN missions, with 275 fatalities from attacks, accidents or other causes, according to the website.
Of these, 177 deaths have come from hostile acts, 10 of them since January.
The latest attack against the Egyptian contingent was on July 5, when two peacekeepers were killed and five seriously hurt near Gao, in northern Mali.
A UN official in Bamako said Egypt contributed 1,035 out of the total 12,261 UN peacekeeping troops in Mali.
“It is one of the mission’s biggest contingents,” he said.
The announcement comes at a time when Mali’s ruling junta is wrestling with a bloody insurgency and friction with international partners.
The UN Security Council renewed MINUSMA’s mandate for one year on June 29, although the junta opposed requests to allow freedom of movement for rights’ investigators with the mission.
On Thursday, Mali announced it was suspending all rotations by MINUSMA troops and police for reasons of “national security”.
Troops from France’s Barkhane operation are due to complete their pullout from Mali in the coming weeks -- a departure sparked by a bustup between Paris and the junta which took power in September 2020.
The junta stirred French anger over delays in its pledge to restore civilian rule, and then wove closer ties with the Kremlin, bringing in paramilitaries that France says are mercenaries from the controversial pro-Kremlin Wagner group.
The French withdrawal is likely to have an operational impact for MINUSMA, as French air power has been a major source of support.
A western diplomat whose country supplies troops to MINUSMA said that the “hindrances” to the mission “are clearly going to make several contributing countries question their commitments.” “Some contingents were present in Mali because Barkhane was there,” Ornella Moderan, a researcher at the South African-based Institute for Security Studies (ISS) told AFP in February.
“With the French troops going, will the Germans, the English or the Swedes be staying?” she asked.

1,American tourists splurge in Paris as euro slides,PARIS: American tourist Shawna Wilson says she has splashed out on four dresses at a high-end LVMH-owned department...,"PARIS: American tourist Shawna Wilson says she has splashed out on four dresses at a high-end LVMH-owned department store in Paris, tempted by prices as the euro reached parity with the US dollar.
The euro tumbled below $1 on Wednesday for the first time in two decades on fears that rising energy prices triggered by the Ukraine conflict could tip the European Union into a prolonged economic crisis.
“It’s like it’s on sale here,” said Wilson, 49, from Colorado, whose purchases included two dresses for her daughter. “Because the euro and the dollar are about the same, it definitely encourages us to spend.”  
The weak euro is big draw for tourists, particularly Americans who are flagged as a key growth driver for the European luxury goods sector.
The strong dollar versus the euro contributed to a four-fold rise in tourism spending in Europe last month compared with last year, with an acceleration in spending from Americans, analysts at UBS said.
The luxury sector has rebounded quickly from the pandemic as people rushed to spend money saved during lockdowns _ buying themselves treats as socialising resumed.
But sales in China, the world’s largest luxury goods market, have plunged this year as a new wave of strict  lockdowns shuttered shops, crimped demand and also meant fewer high-spending Chinese tourists in Europe.
So as Americans fill up transatlantic flights, their eagerness to cash in on the weak euro is helping to replace business lost as a result of the lack of Chinese visitors, who were the main source of luxury sales growth in Europe pre-pandemic.
Luxury goods companies Richemont and Burberry on Friday reported higher sales in Europe, which helped to offset a drop of more than 30 percent in China.
France has benefited most from the tourists’ splurge.

2,Tehran unveils naval drone division,"“If the enemies make a mistake, (these drones) will present them with a regrettable response,” commander says.","TEHRAN: Iran’s navy on Friday unveiled its first division of ships and submarines capable of carrying armed drones, as US President Joe Biden tours the Middle East.
The United States and Israel, the sworn enemies of Iran, have previously accused the Islamic republic of using drones and missiles to attack US forces and Israel-linked ships in the Gulf.
“The first drone-carrier division of the Iranian navy consisting of ships and submarine units carrying all types of drone for combat, detection and destruction has been unveiled,” state television said.
“All types of the latest advanced drones produced by the military and the defence ministry have flown over the Indian Ocean’s waters to demonstrate their capabilities,” it added, showing images of drones taking off from a naval vessel.
The announcement comes as Biden undertakes his first presidential visit to Israel, where he and the Jewish state’s caretaker Prime Minister Yair Lapid on Thursday signed a security pact reinforcing their common front against Iran.
Biden’s trip also included a presentation of Israel’s “Iron Beam” air defence system, which uses lasers to intercept drones and missiles.
“As we are aware of the aggressive attitude in the (United States’) system of domination, it is necessary to increase our defensive capabilities day-by-day,” Iranian army commander Abdolrahim Mousavi said on television.
“If the enemies make a mistake, (these drones) will present them with a regrettable response,” he warned during the unveiling.
In October 2021, the United States imposed sanctions targeting Iran’s drone programme, accusing it of supplying the technology to its allies in the region, such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the Houthis of Yemen and the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Monday said Iran plans to deliver “hundreds of drones” to Russia to aid its war on Ukraine.
On Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian dismissed Sullivan’s accusations as “baseless”, during a telephone conversation with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba.
Iran began developing its drone programme in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq war.

3,"After sensational trial, Johnny Depp releases an album","NEW YORK: Fresh off his highly publicised, controversial defamation suit, actor Johnny Depp sought to show his...","NEW YORK: Fresh off his highly publicised, controversial defamation suit, actor Johnny Depp sought to show his creative career was back on track, releasing an album with English rocker Jeff Beck on Friday.
The 13-track album “18”, on which Depp sings and plays guitar, features mainly covers, and so far it has been critically panned.
It’s a record unlikely to figure prominently in the repertoire of Beck, the 78-year-old former member of The Yardbirds.
The album includes renditions of Marvin Gaye’s What’s Going On and John Lennon’s Isolation, as well as the Velvet Underground classic, Venus In Furs.
The choice to include a song focused on sado-masochism might seem bizarre to some, given the ultra-mediatised trial centred on alleged domestic abuse between Depp and his ex-wife Amber Heard, the actor best known for her role in Aquaman. 
The album includes a song the 59-year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star penned himself: This is a Song for Miss Hedy Lamarr. 
“Erased by the same world that made her a star / Spun out of beauty, trapped by its web,” Depp sings of Lamarr, who secluded herself in the final years of her life.

4,China asks UN Security Council to ban sale of small arms to Haiti,"UNITED NATIONS: China has asked the UN Security Council to vote on banning small arms deliveries to Haiti, setting ...","UNITED NATIONS: China has asked the UN Security Council to vote on banning small arms deliveries to Haiti, setting up a potential stand-off Friday with the United States whose draft resolution does not reflect Beijing’s proposal.
Gang violence in the Caribbean nation has been soaring — alongside fuel shortages and rising food prices — with at least 89 people killed in the Port-au-Prince capital region alone this week. Aid agencies have said many areas are dangerous to access.
Council members are considering renewing a United Nations political mission to Haiti which expires on Friday night, but whether Chinese diplomats will go as far as to veto the latest resolution remains to be seen.
This diplomatic activity comes as Haiti announced Thursday night a rare seizure of weapons in cargo containers: 18 military grade weapons, four 9mm handguns, 14,646 rounds of ammunition and $50,000 in counterfeit money.
Haitian prosecutors said arrest warrants have been issued against several people suspected of being linked to the cache.
Beijing has taken an increasingly prominent role in issues relating to Haiti at the UN in recent years -- primarily over Haiti’s recognition of self-ruled Taiwan, which China views as its own territory.
“The situation in Haiti can’t be worse. As we conduct the negotiations here, the gang violence is escalating in Port-au-Prince,” a spokeswoman for the Chinese mission to the UN said.
“An embargo of weapons against criminal gangs (is) the minimum the Council should do in response to the appalling situation,” she added, echoing the Chinese proposal for Security Council member states to ban small arms deliveries.
But the revised text from the United States and Mexico finalized late Thursday and seen by AFP falls short of a full embargo.
Diplomatic sources said Thursday that China has also asked the Council to vote on sanctions against Haiti’s gang leaders, and even sending a regional police force to the violence-plagued island.
The individual sanctions would include travel bans and asset freezes, according to a draft text also seen by AFP.
Countries that have diplomatic relations with China usually refrain from having official exchanges with Taiwan. Beijing denies any link between its stance at the United Nations and the Taiwan issue, however.
A Chinese diplomatic source told AFP that it was necessary to push political authorities in Haiti to act, and to put those responsible for the violence on notice. The United States is not necessarily against such sanctions, but they must be the right fit, an American diplomat said on condition of anonymity.

5,S. Arabia opens airspace to  ‘all carriers’ in gesture to Israel,"JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia announced on Friday it was lifting restrictions on “all carriers” using its airspace, an...","JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia announced on Friday it was lifting restrictions on “all carriers” using its airspace, an apparent gesture of openness towards Israel hours before US President Joe Biden’s arrival.
The US leader welcomed the “historic” decision, the latest conciliatory move by Riyadh concerning the Jewish state, which it has refused to recognise despite intensive efforts by the Israelis to establish ties with Arab countries.
The Saudi civil aviation authority “announces the decision to open the Kingdom’s airspace for all air carriers that meet the requirements of the authority for overflying”, it said in a statement.
The decision was made “to complement the Kingdom’s efforts aimed at consolidating the Kingdom’s position as a global hub connecting three continents”.
Biden said in a statement later Friday that Riyadh’s move came “thanks to months of steady diplomacy between my administration and Saudi Arabia”, where he is set to travel in the afternoon as part of a Middle East tour.
“As we mark this important moment, Saudi Arabia’s decision can help build momentum toward Israel’s further integration into the region, including with Saudi Arabia,” Biden said.
Israeli Prime Minister Yair Lapid thanked Biden on Friday for “long, intense and secret diplomatic negotiations between Saudi Arabia and the United States” to reach a deal on overflights.
“And I want to thank the Saudi leadership for opening their airspace. This is only a first step,” Lapid said.
Prior to Biden’s arrival in Israel at the start of his Middle East trip on Wednesday, Washington had hinted that more Arab nations could take steps to pursue relations with the Jewish state. That spurred speculation about whether Riyadh would alter its long-held position of not establishing official bilateral ties until the conflict with the Palestinians is resolved.
The kingdom did not show any opposition when its regional ally, the United Arab Emirates, established diplomatic ties with Israel in 2020, followed by Bahrain and Morocco under the US-brokered Abraham Accords.
Yet analysts have stressed that any immediate gains are likely to be incremental and that Riyadh will probably not agree to formal ties — not during Biden’s visit or while King Salman, 86, still reigns.
Biden will travel to the Saudi city of Jeddah on the Red Sea coast Friday afternoon, despite a previous vow to treat the kingdom as a “pariah” over the 2018 murder and dismemberment of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
He is to travel directly from the Jewish state to Saudi Arabia -- becoming the first US president to fly from there to an Arab nation that does not recognise it.
In 2017, his predecessor, Donald Trump, made the journey in reverse.
Shortly after the Abraham Accords were announced in 2020, Saudi Arabia allowed an Israeli aircraft to pass over en route to Abu Dhabi and announced that UAE flights to “all countries” could overfly the kingdom.
Friday’s announcement effectively lifts overflight restrictions on aircraft travelling to and from Israel.

6,Facebook owner Meta releases first human rights report,Human rights groups including Amnesty International have demanded the release of the India assessment in full.,"SAN FRANCISCO: Facebook owner Meta released its first annual human rights report on Thursday, following years of accusations that it turned a blind eye to online abuses that fueled real-world violence in places like India and Myanmar.
The report, which covers due diligence performed in 2020 and 2021, includes a summary of a controversial human rights impact assessment of India that Meta commissioned law firm Foley Hoag to conduct.
Human rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have demanded the release of the India assessment in full, accusing Meta of stalling in a joint letter sent in January.
In its summary, Meta said the law firm had noted the potential for “salient human rights risks” involving Meta’s platforms, including “advocacy of hatred that incites hostility, discrimination, or violence.” The assessment, it added, did not probe “accusations of bias in content moderation.” Ratik Asokan, a representative from India Civil Watch International who participated in the assessment and later organized the joint letter, told Reuters the summary struck him as an attempt by Meta to “whitewash” the firm’s findings.
“It’s as clear evidence as you can get that they’re very uncomfortable with the information that’s in that report,” he said. “At least show the courage to release the executive summary so we can see what the independent law firm has said.” Human Rights Watch researcher Deborah Brown likewise called the summary “selective” and said it “brings us no closer” to understanding the company’s role in the spread of hate speech in India or commitments it will make to address the issue.
Rights groups for years have raised alarms about anti-Muslim hate speech stoking tensions in India, Meta’s largest market globally by number of users.

7,G20 talks overshadowed by Ukraine war,Some Western ministers blasted Russian officials attending the talks.,"NUSA DUA: G20 finance leaders meeting in Bali must make progress tackling the global economic threats sparked by Russia’s war in Ukraine or the humanitarian consequences would be catastrophic, host Indonesia said on Friday.
Some Western ministers blasted Russian officials attending the talks, with US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen saying Russia’s “brutal and unjust war” was solely responsible for the economic crisis the world now faces.
Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which the Kremlin calls a “special military operation”, has overshadowed recent G20 meetings, including last week’s gathering of foreign ministers.
Host Indonesia’s Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the world had high hopes the G20 could find a solution to the threat of war, rising commodity prices and the spillover effects on the ability of low-income countries to repay debt.
“We are acutely aware that the cost of our failure to work together is more than we can afford. The humanitarian consequences for the world, and especially for many low-income countries would be catastrophic,” she said.
G20 members include Western countries that have imposed sanctions on Russia and accuse it of war crimes in Ukraine - which Moscow denies - as well as nations like China, India and South Africa, which have been more muted in their response.
Sri Mulyani urged members to “build bridges between each other” to deliver more technical decisions and concrete action.
She also called for a joint forum involving G20 finance and agriculture ministries to come up with concrete action to tackle growing food insecurity and a looming fertilizer supply crisis.
Indonesia’s G20 deputy for finance, Wempi Saputra, told Reuters Friday’s discussions were productive and members did not walk out during Russia’s address as they have done previously.
Russian Deputy Finance Minister Timur Maksimov addressed the meeting in person, while Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov was participating virtually, a source familiar with the matter said.
“It’s no secret that there were very frank statements being made (in the meeting), yet what matters is we are at the moment of enormous distress and disruption in our global economy as well as our geopolitical context,” Achim Steiner, UNDP administrator, who attended one of the sessions, told Reuters.
Wempi said the group is still discussing the possibility of issuing a communique for this meeting.
But Western countries have repeatedly said G20 meetings cannot be “business as usual” due to Russia’s presence.
Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told Russian officials that she held them personally responsible for “war crimes” committed during Russia’s war, a Western official told Reuters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov walked out of one session of a G20 meeting with his counterparts in Bali last week, following what he called “frenzied criticism” of his country over the war. That meeting ended without a communique or any announcements of agreements.
EU economy commissioner Paolo Gentiloni via video-link said the global economy faces a “major setback” because of the war.

8,US House committee to consider ban on assault weapons,WASHINGTON: A committee of the US House of Representatives is set to vote next week for the first time in nearly 20...,"WASHINGTON: A committee of the US House of Representatives is set to vote next week for the first time in nearly 20 years on a bill that would ban assault weapons.
“Our country has witnessed senseless killing after senseless killing and each time one fact has remained remarkably consistent -- the weapon of choice for mass slaughter is a high-powered assault weapon,” Jerold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said in a statement.
The Democrat from New York said the bill, which would ban the sale, import, manufacture or transfer of certain semi-automatic weapons, would be considered by the committee on Wednesday.
If the “Assault Weapons Ban of 2021” passes the Democratic-controlled committee it would go to the full House, where Democrats are in the majority.
It would be likely doomed to fail in the Senate, however.
Democrats have 50 seats in the 100-member Senate and 10 Republican votes would be needed to bring the measure to the floor.

9,US to resume International Space Station flights with Russia,"WASHINGTON: The United States said on Friday it would resume flights to the International Space Station with Russia,...","WASHINGTON: The United States said on Friday it would resume flights to the International Space Station with Russia, despite its attempts to isolate Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. 
“To ensure continued safe operations of the International Space Station, protect the lives of astronauts and ensure continuous US presence in space, NASA will resume integrated crews on US crew spacecraft and the Russian Soyuz,” the US space agency said in a statement. 
NASA said that astronaut Frank Rubio would fly with two Russian cosmonauts on a Soyuz rocket scheduled to launch on September 21 from Kazakhstan, with another astronaut, Loral O’Hara, taking another mission in early 2023. 
In a first, Russian cosmonauts will join NASA astronauts on SpaceX’s new Crew-5 which will launch in September from Florida with a Japanese astronaut also on the mission. Another joint mission on the SpaceX Crew-6 will fly out in early 2023, NASA said. 
The move comes despite the European Space Agency earlier this week terminating its relationship with Russia on a mission to put a rover on Mars, infuriating Russian space chief Dmitry Rogozin who banned cosmonauts on the ISS from using a European-made robotic arm. 
But hours before NASA’s announcement, President Vladimir Putin dismissed Rogozin, a firebrand nationalist and ardent backer of the Ukraine invasion who once quipped that US astronauts should get to the space station on trampolines rather than Russian rockets. 
NASA said that the International Space Station was always designed to be operated jointly with participation from the space agencies of the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. 
“The station was designed to be interdependent and relies on contributions from each space agency to function. No one agency has the capability to function independent of the others,” it said.
Soyuz rockets were the only way to reach the space station until SpaceX, run by the billionaire Elon Musk, debuted a capsule in 2020. 
The last NASA astronaut to take a Soyuz to the station was NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei in 2021. He returned to Earth in March this year alongside Russian cosmonauts, also on a Soyuz. 
Speaking to reporters afterward, Vande Hei said that the cosmonauts remained his “very dear friends” despite their nations’ tense relationship. 
“We supported each other throughout everything,” he said. “And I never had any concerns about my ability to continue working with them.” 
The United States has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia after Putin on February 24 invaded Ukraine, defying Western warnings. 
The sanctions, which include tough restrictions on financial interactions, have led to an exodus of leading US brands from Russia including Starbucks and McDonald’s. 
But the International Space Station is unique. It was launched in 1998 at a time of hope for US-Russia cooperation following their Space Race competition during the Cold War. 
The ISS is expected to wind down in the next decade. 
Rogozin, the outgoing head of Russian space agency Roscosmos, had warned that Western sanctions could affect cooperation. 
“If you block cooperation with us, who will save the ISS from uncontrolled deorbiting and falling on US or European territory?” Rogozin wrote in a tweet earlier this year — noting that the station does not fly over much of Russia. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov did not indicate that his removal meant Putin was unhappy with Rogozin. 
One independent media outlet said he would be promoted and could be put in charge of occupied territories in Ukraine.

Built in the 1980s, the Soviet-era streetcars may look rickety as they rattle past war-damaged buildings, but for local people they represent a step back towards something like normal life in a district that came under heavy bombardment in the days following Russia’s invasion in late February.
Igor Popov, 59, a passenger who hopped on to a tram when the service restarted on Thursday, said it cut his travel time to work from four hours by various buses to just 40 minutes.
“I live in an area in Saltivka that was intensively shelled and we had no transport,” he said.
“If you need to go somewhere it is very inconvenient, and with the restart of this route everything became much easier.”
On Feb. 27, three days after Russia invaded, the trams’ electrical power station was destroyed by heavy shelling, as was their depot shortly after.
Of Saltivka’s roughly 160 trams, part of the Kharkiv city fleet, 60 were destroyed and another 60 damaged, according to district tram officials.
The remaining 40 are now returning to service, after Ukrainian forces retook the area around the country’s second largest city in May.
Only a small percentage of Saltivka’s pre-war population remain due to the heavy bombardment it suffered. The revived tram service is a spot of joy for the residents who are still living there, said tram driver Natalia Pavlenko.
“When public transport works, people can go to work, and they don’t think so much about the war,” she said.
