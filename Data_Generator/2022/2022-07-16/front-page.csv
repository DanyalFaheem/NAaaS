0,Country’s ‘political heart’ weighed down by apathy,"Posters and banners abound, but workers’ political zeal sapped by issues such as inflation.","LAHORE: With crucial by-elections in 20 Punjab Assembly constituencies just 24 hours away now, and leaders of both major competing parties, the ruling PML-N and opposition PTI, are making final efforts to woo the electorate on the concluding day of campaigning on Friday. But something has been amiss in Lahore — the traditional electoral battle ground between both parties during the weeks preceding polling day ­—­ unlike recent general and by-polls. 
Canvassing for the by-polls ended on Friday midnight with both the PML-N and PTI urging their workers to put their energies into bringing out voters from their homes on the polling day (tomorrow). But while the senior leadership of both rival parties held huge public rallies in pretty much all 20 constituencies, conventional door-to-door campaigns and corner meetings of workers, especially of the PML-N, to engage voters were conspicuous by their absence in the four constituencies of the capital of Punjab. 
Some PML-N activists that Dawn spoke to in these four constituencies of Lahore cited the leadership’s decision to allot party tickets to PTI defectors that hurt the core party workers and damaged their morale, who did not actively participate in the campaign. A visit to some areas falling in the PP-158, PP-167, PP-168 and PP-170 constituencies showed ‘aggressive campaigning’ in terms of posters, banners and flexes adorning several streets, but the zeal and fervour among locals ahead of an election was found missing. 
“I am not interested in voting for any party in Sunday’s by-poll. We were buried under inflation and price hike by the previous PTI government, and now in three months, the PML-N-led coalition has been exposed as it further burdened the masses with price increase of almost every daily-use commodity,” said Ibrar Ahmad of Wapda Town. He said politicians across the divide did not seem interested or concerned about people’s lives, so it didn’t matter who won, as the plight of the masses wasn’t going to ease. 

Posters and banners abound, but workers’ political zeal sapped by issues such as inflation

As political observers predicted a low turnout tomorrow, a neck and neck contest was expected between the PML-N and PTI with both claiming a sweep in the by-polls.  
Unlike the by-elections held soon after the 2018 general polls, the party of the Sharifs has this time introduced a new slogan — ‘Khidmat ko vote do’ (give vote to people’s service) — replacing its much-used, popular narrative of  ‘Vote ko izzat do’ (give respect to the ballot). 
PML-N circles defended the party’s new narrative, saying the previous slogan was aimed at the powers that be. “Since the establishment is on good terms with us again, we no longer need this narrative and have replaced it with ‘Khidmat ko vote do’, which has a political appeal, considering our past record of serving people.” 
On the other hand, Imran Khan’s PTI is banking on targeting the party’s defectors, whom they called lotas (turncoats) and who were now contesting these elections on a PML-N ticket, to lure its voters. 
Of the four joint PML-N and PPP candidates in Lahore, three — Chaudhry Amin Zulqarnain (PP-170), Nazir Chohan (PP-167) and Asad Khokhar (PP-I68) — were PTI defectors, who voted for Hamza Shehbaz in the chief minister’s election in April, while the fourth is a PML-N member. 
The ruling coalition’s candidate in PP-158, PML-N’s Ahsan Sharafat, is said to be a favourite of party stalwart Sardar Ayaz Sadiq who managed to outmanoeuvre Shoaib Siddiqui, a nominee of PTI defector Aleem Khan. Aleem had won from this provincial constituency in the 2018 general elections beating Sharafat with a margin of over 7,000 votes, while Sadiq clinched the MNA’s seat here defeating Aleem. The senior PML-N leader was recently made to quit his federal economic affairs ministry to campaign for the party nominee whose position was said to be weak and since PTI dissident Aleem was not supporting him. 
Punjab minister Salman Rafique had also resigned from office to work with Mr Sadiq here. This constituency has seen massive election activities with the PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz and PTI’s Imran Khan both holding large rallies. 
The PTI candidate here against Sharafat is Mian Akram Usman, the son-in-law of party’s former Punjab minister Mian Mahmoodur Rashid. 
However, the political workers and voters weren’t too excited. “At the moment, we are sick of politics. Our lives have become miserable due to the unbridled inflation and politicians are concerned with their businesses,” said Muhammad Younas of Basti Syden Shah, Upper Mall. 
Since both candidates were less known, it was likely the electorate would vote for the party of its choice rather than the candidate. 
Over in PP-170, PML-N contender Amin Zulqarnain, the brother of adviser to the former premier Awn Chaudhry, was up against the PTI’s strong candidate Zaheer Abbas Khokhar -- a former MNA and managing director of Baitul Maal. His campaign was a lot more vigorous being spearheaded by party stalwart Dr Yasmin Rashid, while Zulqarnain was at a disadvantage as PML-N voters and leadership didn’t want to support him for having just recently defected from their rival PTI. This was also why there weren’t many senior PML-N leaders in the field campaigning for him. 
Yet, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz had tasked her ‘blue-eyed’ Khokhar brothers — Saif, Afzal and Faisal — of Johar Town to ensure Zulqarnain’s victory.  
In PP-168, PML-N backed Malik Asad Khokhar is taking on PTI’s Malik Nawaz Awan, a trader by profession. 
Railways Minister Saad Rafique is an MNA from this constituency, who had also won this provincial seat in the 2018 general elections. But when he gave up the provincial constituency to retain his national seat, Asad Khokhar contested the by-poll on a PTI ticket and won. Since then, Khokhar had carved a name for himself here and was likely to give his rival a run for his money. 
A PML-N insider said the leadership was confident about Khokhar’s position and believed he didn’t need Saad’s help. 
In PP-167, Nazir Chohan, who was part of the Jahangir Tareen group of PTI, had been allotted the PML-N ticket. Chohan assumed notoriety when he challenged the faith of former adviser to Imran Khan Shahzad Akbar. However, when Akbar used the muscle of the Federal Investigation Agency, Chohan apologized. Earlier this year, he defected from his party to vote for Hamza as the CM. 
The PML-N had a considerable vote bank in this constituency, and those canvassing for Chohan here included party MNA Ali Pervaiz Malik — whose mother Shaista Pervaiz is an MNA from this constituency — and Maryam Nawaz. 
The PTI, on the other hand, had fielded its activist Shabbir Gujjar, who is the brother of party leader Khalid Gujjar and who had accused the Punjab police of raiding his offices and arresting his workers on the directions of the ruling PML-N. Gujjar was on the stump in the constituency with the help of former ministers Hammad Azhar and Shafqat Mehmood. 
The PP-167 was the only constituency in Lahore that experienced episodes of violence between workers of the two rival parties, after which the election commission ordered a probe. Religious parties like the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan and Pakistan Awami Tehreek of Dr Tahirul Qadri also had some vote bank in these areas. In the 2018 elections, the right-wing TLP secured the third highest votes here. 
Nawaz monitoring poll drive
PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif had been overseeing the by-polls campaign from London.  
According to a party insider, on Nawaz’s directions, four federal and provincial ministers had resigned to canvas for party candidates. “In addition to this, at least eight MPAs and four MNAs in each of the 20 constituencies of Punjab were tasked by Nawaz with leading the campaigns effectively. These lawmakers were asked to ‘fix’ their candidates’ problems with the help of CM Hamza and make sure disgruntled party workers were placated and ally PPP pushed to extend full cooperation.”   
PPP’s ‘late entry’
The PPP’s local leadership, especially in Lahore, woke up just days before campaigning ended on Friday midnight, reportedly after Nawaz Sharif requested PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari to send his party troops to support PML-N-backed candidates. 
The PPP workers and leaders remained aloof from campaigns of PML-N candidates reportedly because of their ideological differences with the party of the Sharifs. However, since the PML-N could not afford to lose the CM’s office, its top leadership pushed Zardari to intervene and make sure PPP leaders and workers canvassed for their joint candidates.

1,"Body to decide if President Alvi, ex-PM Imran can be tried for treason",Commission of inquiry also appointed to look into harassment allegations against ex-NAB chief.,"ISLAMABAD: Just a day ahead of the by-elections in Punjab, the federal cabinet on Friday constituted a special ministerial committee to pursue high treason proceedings against top office-holders of the former PTI government, and also decided to appoint a commission of inquiry (COI) to probe into allegations of sexual abuse against head of the country’s accountability watchdog and misuse of its evidence for political objectives by the former prime minister’s office.
Briefing the media after the cabinet meeting presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the meeting through a resolution welcomed the detailed judgement of the Supreme Court, and constituted a special committee, led by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and comprising ministers for information and interior and members of all coalition partners, for legal action under Article 6 of the Constitution.
She said the apex court decision was very clear and had mentioned the names of the president, the then prime minister, speaker and deputy speaker of the National Assembly who used their constitutional offices for personal political purposes. She claimed the court had concluded that the narrative of regime change through a foreign conspiracy was fabricated, false, and baseless. The resolution also said the former PTI government had made serious efforts to damage economic security and national interest on the foreign front.
The minister said the cabinet also decided that constitutional disobedience and violations and attacks on parliament should be taken seriously to avoid their recurrence in the future. The special committee was therefore directed to come up with recommendations on the future course of action before the next cabinet meeting. The apex court had also buried the law of necessity and observed that constitutional violations had been committed by the PTI government’s top office-holders. The committee would cover all the points raised by the court.

Commission of inquiry also appointed to look into harassment allegations against ex-NAB chief

The SC had ruled that the April 3 ruling of the then deputy speaker Qasim Suri had apparently breached the Constitution and led to a chain of actions, including allowing the then prime minister Imran Khan to hold on to the constitutional office by illegally avoiding the no-confidence motion without a vote by the assembly.
Under Article 6, “any person who abrogates or subverts or suspends or holds in abeyance, or attempts or conspires to abrogate or subvert or suspend or hold in abeyance, the Constitution by use of force or show of force or by any other unconstitutional means shall be guilty of high treason”. As of now, proceedings under this article had been held only once in the country under which military dictator former president retired Gen Pervez Musharraf was convicted by a special court, but the judgement remained unimplemented.
Ms Aurangzeb further said the cabinet also decided to appoint a commission of inquiry under the COI Act 2017 to probe all aspects of the allegations by Tayyaba Gul and other women against outgoing chairman of the National Accountability Bureau and head of the Commission on Enforced Disappearances, retired Justice Javed Iqbal, and involvement of the Prime Minister Office in the matter for political gains.
She said Law Minister Tarar was designated as the head of another committee of the cabinet to finalise the terms of reference of the COI in line with discussions in the cabinet meeting, as well as asked to suggest a panel to choose a name from for the head of the COI, and return to the cabinet for approval.
Tayyaba Gul, she said, had lodged a complaint on the Citizen’s Portal of the prime minister during the previous government against sexual harassment and abuse by former NAB chief Javed Iqbal and sought justice. Ms Gul was first informed that her complaint had been referred to the Human Rights Ministry, but then called to the PM Office and “held in captivity” for 18 days.
The minister alleged the then rulers “abducted” Gul and kept her hostage, and instead of providing her justice or taking any action, all the evidences and videos were collected from her and used by the PMO to blackmail and pressurise the former NAB chairman to victimise the political opponents of Imran Khan. This way, not only were Mr Iqbal and the NAB as an institution compromised, but were used for political objectives and victimisation of opponents.
The minister further said the COI would be time-bound to conclude its probe because sexual harassment and abuse were not only serious social crimes, but involved the office of the prime minister and its complaint portal.
Not only this, Ms Aurangzeb alleged, Javed Iqbal had emerged as a “habitual harasser”, as many other women had also complained against him in his capacity as chairman of the commission on enforced disappearances. All this happened under the mindset in which the former prime minister used to blame victims of rape for the crime. Those complaints would also be referred to the COI, she stressed.

2,"Nine terrorists killed, soldier martyred in Balochistan in search for abducted man",Havildar martyred during an operation against the killers of Lt Col Laiq Baig Mirza.,"QUETTA: Nine terrorists were killed and a havildar was martyred during an operation against the killers of Lt Col Laiq Baig Mirza, an army officer who was kidnapped earlier this week while travelling to Quetta from Ziarat, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Friday. 
However, Lt Col Mirza’s cousin, Umer Javed, who was kidnapped alongside him en route to Quetta, has yet to be recovered. 
Security forces swooped down on a “hideout of terrorists” in the mountains near Ziarat after Thursday midnight, ISPR said.  
Once the terrorists realised they had been encircled, according to the statement, they opened fire at the advancing contingent, resulting in the martyrdom of Havildar Khan Muhammad.  
The security forces later undertook a “clearance operation” and managed to eliminate five fighters belonging to the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) after a heavy exchange of fire. 
The security forces then spotted another group of terrorists near Ziarat Nullah and killed four of them, the statement added. The rest escaped under cover of heavy rain and darkness.  
“The nine bodies of terrorists are being handed over to the civil administration for completion of legal formalities,” officials said. 
In a statement on Thursday, ISPR had said that SSG commandos had launched a search operation to recover the men and that on the night between July 13 and 14, a group of six to eight terrorists was spotted moving in a nullah in nearby mountains. Seeing the forces closing-in, the militants shot Lt Col Mirza in the head and attempted to flee, the statement added.
In the ensuing exchange of fire, two terrorists were killed while the remaining managed to flee, along with their other captive, Mr Umer. 
According to APP, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the martyred Lt Col Laiq Baig, saying his sacrifice would not go in vain and that the killers would be taken to task. 
Mr Shehbaz offered condolences to the family of Lt Col Laiq Baig and prayed that his soul rest in peace. 
The prime minister said the officers and jawans of the Pakistan Army were rendering great sacrifices for the motherland in the fight against terrorists. “The nation is determined to eliminate terrorism once and for all.”

3,PM’s son declared ‘proclaimed offender’,"LAHORE: A special court on Friday declared the prime minister’s younger son, Suleman Shehbaz, a proclaimed ...","LAHORE: A special court on Friday declared the prime minister’s younger son, Suleman Shehbaz, a proclaimed offender (PO) along with another suspect in a Rs16 billion money-laundering case. 
Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz, who was also booked by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in the case, earlier appeared before the court, while a one-time exemption from personal appearance was sought on behalf of PM Shehbaz. 
Presiding judge Ijaz Hassan Awan allowed the application, with directions to the prime minister to ensure his appearance before the special court (central-I) at the next hearing, fixed for July 30. 
At the hearing, the investigating officer apprised the court that the process had been completed to declare Suleman and Tahir Naqvi proclaimed offenders, because both suspects failed to respond to the summons. 
The judge declared them POs and directed the IO to submit details of moveable and immoveable assets, owned by the suspects, to be frozen. 
The judge further asked the FIA to submit a death certificate and other evidence about the death of another absconding suspect, Malik Maqsood Ahmad, a peon in the Ramzan Sugar Mills. 
Earlier on June 11, the court had confirmed the interim pre-arrest bail of PM Shehbaz and CM Hamza in the money laundering case. The FIA had booked the PML-N president and his two sons, Hamza and Suleman, in November 2020 under Sections 419, 420, 468, 471, 34 and 109 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, read with Section 3/4 of Anti-Money Laundering Act.  
The trial court had granted interim bail to Shehbaz and Hamza on June 21, 2021, a day before their first appearance at the FIA. The court is yet to indict the suspects, as arguments of the defence against the challan had not been completed.

4,Biden lands in Saudi Arabia to mend fences,"Slew of measures on mobile technology, cybersecurity announced; Biden raises Khashoggi killing with Saudi crown prince.","• Slew of measures on mobile technology, cybersecurity announced  • Biden raises Khashoggi killing with MbS  • Meets Palestinian president, greeted by ‘Justice for Shireen’ posters
JEDDAH: US President Joe Biden landed on Friday in Saudi Arabia and met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, beating a retreat from his campaign pledge to turn the kingdom into a “pariah” over human rights abuses. 
Saudi state media showed images of Air Force One at the airport in the coastal city of Jeddah after a flight from Israel, making Biden the first US leader to fly directly from the Jewish state to an Arab nation that does not recognise it. 
Wearing sunglasses, Biden emerged from Air Force One to walk down a purple carpet and be greeted by Makkah Governor Prince Khaled al-Faisal and Princess Reema bint Bandar Al-Saud, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Washington. 
Later, state television Al-Ekhbariya showed Prince Mohammed, the kingdom’s de facto leader, greeting Biden with a fist bump and escorting him into Jeddah’s Al-Salam palace. 

 





 
Biden met Saudi King Salman, 86, then he and Prince Mohammed sat across from one another at a large conference table for a “working session”, flanked by top officials. 
Shadow of Khashoggi killing
After taking office last year, Biden’s administration released US intelligence findings that Prince Mohammed “approved” an operation targeting journalist Jamal Khashoggi, whose gruesome killing in Saudi Arabia’s Istanbul consulate sparked global outrage. Saudi officials deny Prince Mohammed’s involvement and say Khashoggi’s death resulted from a “rogue” operation. 
Biden now appears ready to re-engage with a country that has been a key strategic ally of the United States for decades, a major supplier of oil and an avid buyer of weapons. Washington wants the world’s largest exporter of crude to open the floodgates to bring down soaring gasoline prices, which threaten Democratic chances in November mid-term elections. 
The US president said on Friday he raised the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi “at the top of the meeting” with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
“What happened to Khashoggi was outrageous... I just made it clear if anything occurs like that again they will get that response and much more,” Biden said after meeting Prince Mohammed.
But the slain journalist’s fiancée said Biden had enabled the crown prince to take more victims after the US leader met and fist-bumped the man accused of ordering the journalist’s murder.
In the form of what she imagined as a tweet by Khashoggi, Hatice Cengiz wrote to Biden, “Is this the accountability you promised for my murder? The blood of MBS’s next victim is on your hands.” 

 





 
“The fist bump between President Biden and Mohammed bin Salman was worse than a handshake — it was shameful,” said Fred Ryan, the publisher and CEO of The Washington Post, which has demanded accountability for the death of its late contributor.
Package of announcements
US and Saudi Arabia announced various measures, ranging from the removal of peacekeepers from a strategic island off the Saudi and Egyptian coasts, to cooperation in mobile technology.
In the statement released after Biden held talks with senior Saudi officials, Washington welcomed previously announced accelerated oil production increases by OPEC+, a group which includes Saudi Arabia and Russia.
The statement said US and other peacekeepers would leave Tiran island where they have been stationed as part of accords reached in 1978 and which led to a peace deal between Israel and Egypt. 
Other announcements also covered an agreement on cooperation on 5G and 6G mobile technology and on cybersecurity. 
Meeting with Palestinian president
Jeddah marks the final stop on Biden’s Middle East tour, following talks on Friday with Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas and meetings with Israeli officials a day earlier. Biden promised not to give up efforts to end the decades-long Israeli Palestinian conflict, though he offered no new proposals to restart the stalled political dialogue between the two sides. 
As he wrapped up the first leg of a Middle Eastern trip before departing for Saudi Arabia, Biden visited a hospital in East Jerusalem and pledged a multi-year $100 million package of financial and technical help. 
As Palestinians are banned by Israel from political activity in Jerusalem, the US president travelled to Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank to meet Abbas. 
Standing alongside him, Biden reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution to end the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
There “must be a political horizon that the Palestinian people can actually see”, Biden said. “I know that the goal of the two states seems so far away,” Biden added. 
Abbas said he was “taking steps” to improve relations with Washington and aimed to see the US consulate to Palestinians in Jerusalem — which Trump closed — reopen. 
With Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations moribund since 2014, the US delegation has been focusing on economic measures. 
Biden made clear on Thursday he had no plans to reverse the controversial move by Trump to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, which infuriated Palestinians who see its eastern sector as the seat of their future state. 
‘Justice for Shireen’
Biden was greeted in Bethlehem with a billboard reading “Justice for Shireen”, referring to Shireen Abu Akleh, the veteran Palestinian-American journalist shot dead in May while covering an Israeli army raid in the West Bank. 
The family requested to meet Biden during his visit, but his administration has instead invited them to Washington. 
“I think if President Biden (can) find an hour and a half to go and attend a sport activity, he should have respected the family and given them 10 minutes to listen to them,” said Samer Sinijlawi, chairman of a Palestinian nonprofit, the Jerusalem Development Fund, after Biden on Thursday attended a ceremony for Jewish athletes. 
Speaking alongside Abbas, Biden said the US “will continue to insist on a full and transparent accounting” of Abu Akleh’s death. 
Washington earlier this month concluded she was likely shot from an Israeli military position, but that there was no evidence of intent to kill.
