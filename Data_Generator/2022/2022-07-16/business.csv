0,Impact of fuel price cut must reach masses: cabinet,Ban on import of luxury goods to continue.,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Cabinet on Friday directed the federal and provincial authorities concerned to ensure that the impact of the cut in petroleum prices immediately reached the people in the shape of reduced fares and transportation costs.
Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the cabinet discussed the reduction in the prices of petroleum products and asked the provincial governments to take immediate steps so that the relief reaches the people. She said the cabinet decided to keep a close watch for the implementation of the POL price cut in the shape of reduced fares and resolved to transfer whatever relief becomes available in international markets to the masses.
The cabinet also approved a one-time amnesty until December 31 for foreign nationals overstaying in Pakistan to report and return to their home countries.
The minister said the cabinet ratified the July 5 decision of Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to allow clearance of luxury goods arrived at ports two weeks after the ban on such imports on payment of a five per cent fine and then a 15pc duty on consignments that reached Pakistani ports beyond 15 days. She said the ban on the import of luxury imports would continue.

She said the cabinet also ratified other decisions of the ECC meeting of July 5, including the import of three million tonnes of wheat while keeping in mind the falling international prices. She said the cabinet directed that imports should be ensured in an open and transparent manner and the lowest available prices should be booked.
The cabinet also ratified other decisions of the ECC. This included Rs193 billion worth of supplementary grants to meet requirements for repayment of principal and interest against “short-term external borrowing, Eurobonds and Sukuk” etc.
The ECC had also suspended certain conditions on the import of timber/wood till August 31, 2022 because of the “hardship case of timber importers” as the consignments were supplied against contracts months ago and the shipments had already arrived at ports. The implementation date of the Import Policy Order (IPO 2022) for the import of timber and wood falling under HS Codes 4401 to 4409 will be postponed until August 31, 2022, i.e. for Bills of Lading issued on that date.
It was reported that IPO 2022 conditions could not be met because these imports were supplied against contracts entered into months ago and relevant documents could also not be provided because consignments were in pipeline when the regulations were enforced. Customs had reported that about 224 containers of timber/wood had arrived at various ports where importers had no valid import permit and plant protection release order, and since the consignments had reached, the relevant documentation from the import origin country could not be met.
The cabinet also approved the constitution of 14-member Auction Advisory Committee to oversee spectrum auctions for next generation mobile services. 
With the cabinet ratification, paragraph 3(1) of the IPO 2022 would also be amended to allow the import of goods of Afghan origin against the Pakistan Rupee and without the requirement of Importers’ Electronic I-Form (EIF) for a period of one year.

1,$1.17bn tranche to be released in three to six weeks: IMF,Official says total disbursements from the IMF to Pakistan under the ongoing program are around $4.2 billion.,"WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said that its agreement with Pakistan would lead to a “straight away” disbursement of $1.17 billion to the country.
“It’s an agreement on a combined seventh and eighth review of the programme... that will translate into about $1.17 billion being disbursed to Pakistan. Pretty much, straight away,” IMF’s Communication Director Gerry Rice said at a Thursday afternoon news briefing in Washington.
He said this brought the total disbursements from the IMF to Pakistan under the ongoing program to about $4.2 billion. Answering a question about the timeframe for releasing the tranche, the IMF official said the executive board is likely to meet anywhere between three to six weeks from now.
The IMF and Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement on Wednesday that they hoped would stabilise the country’s economy and depreciating currency. The IMF also hoped that it would bring down high inflation and end Pakistan’s political instability.
The agreement “could also unlock more funding for Pakistan, which in recent weeks has neared the brink of a balance of payments crisis,” Mr Rice said.
The IMF official noted that this was an agreement on a combined seventh and eighth review of the programme that the Fund has with Pakistan.
”And we’re hoping this will help to stabilise the economy and amongst other things help expand the social safety net to protect the most vulnerable; accelerate structural reforms; and help stabilise the macroeconomic situation in Pakistan,” he added.
”The announcement by the IMF will prove to be a much-needed shot in the arm for Pakistan’s ailing economy,” Aqdas Afzal, a Karachi-based analyst and assistant professor of economics at Habib University, told The New York Times. He noted that the sharp increase in energy prices after the invasion of Ukraine and rising commodity prices more generally had hurt the country.
The newspaper noted that reviving the loan programme and getting the economy back on track “have been a political litmus test for Pakistan’s new prime minister.”
The report also highlighted the government’s fear that the IMF-induced reforms could trigger “public backlash that could hurt PML-N’s chance of success in the next general elections.”

The minister said the government held a high-level meeting with the companies involved in CPEC projects.
“The target was to have market access for Pakistani companies in the Chinese market,” he added.
He highlighted the steps identified to achieve this target, which include facilitating Chinese IT companies in establishing offices in Pakistan.
“We can harness Pakistan’s position in the region to make Pakistan a cloud regional hub, and we need collaboration with Chinese counterparts on cloud initiatives,” Mr Haque said.
Talking to  about the ambitious target to export IT services to Chinese markets, the minister said that most Pakistani firms involved in IT exports started as sub-contractors for large companies in the West and other areas.
“Now we have stable IT exports while the freelancers’ base is also strong. Now is the time to ask Chinese companies to outsource projects to the Pakistani IT industry,” he said, adding, “It has been agreed that Chinese firms will start involving Pakistani experts in projects within China.”
The council meeting was attended by Minister for Finance Muftah Ismail, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Youth Affairs Shaza Fatima, Senator Afananullah Khan, representatives of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), and council members from the public and private sector.
The advisory council was formed on June 5 and is headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, with the view of promoting the IT industry and enhancing the digital economy of Pakistan.
The council decided to form committees for IT Export, Personal Data Protection, and Telecom Sector Growth.
The three committees will finalise their recommendations in a week, which will be presented to the PM and the Chairperson of the Advisory Council.
The committee for IT Exports is led by former secretary IT Shoaib Ahmed Siddiqui; the committee for Personal Data Protection Rules by Senator Afnanullah Khan; and the Telecom Committee is chaired by Jazz CEO Amir Ibrahim.

3,Finnish fund buys 17.6pc stake in TPL Insurance,"TPL Insurance CEO says the size of the transaction is $3 million, which amounts to Rs632.8 million at the current exchange rate.","KARACHI: TPL Corporation said on Friday a Finnish fund has successfully completed the transaction to acquire 17.59 per cent shareholding in TPL Insurance, a subsidiary of the Pakistani conglomerate.
Speaking to Dawn, TPL Insurance Ltd CEO Muhammad Aminuddin said the size of the transaction is $3 million, which amounts to Rs632.8 million at the current exchange rate.
Finnish Fund for Industrial Cooperation Ltd, a private firm incorporated in Finland, was originally going to invest roughly Rs540m in the Pakistani insurer through a special rights transaction. However, the investment size increased in the local currency because of the recent depreciation in the exchange rate.
“The investment will come through the issuance of new shares for which we’ve received approval from the regulator,” said the CEO.
Finnfund is a development financier and impact investor that buys stakes in “responsible and profitable” businesses in developing countries.
This is the second investment by an “impact investor” in TPL Insurance, which also raised last year an equity equalling 19.9pc of share capital from DEG, the private equity arm of the German government. The technology-driven business model of TPL Insurance supplemented by the Finnish fund’s global experience and knowledge will result in new product lines, a regulatory filing said.
According to the annual report for 2021, TPL Corporation and TPL Holdings held a collective stake of 64.38pc in TPL Insurance. After the transaction, the stake of the TPL Group in the insurer will reduce to 52pc, said Mr Aminuddin.

5,Saudi Arabia doubles Russian oil imports for power generation,There is little spare capacity for Saudi and others to increase production in the short term.,"MOSCOW: Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter, more than doubled the amount of Russian fuel oil it imported in the second quarter to feed power stations to meet summer cooling demand and free up the kingdoms own crude for export, data showed and traders said.
Russia has been selling fuel at discounted prices after international sanctions over its invasion of Ukraine left it with fewer buyers. Moscow calls the war in Ukraine a  “special military operation”.
The increased sales of fuel oil, used in power generation, to Saudi Arabia show the challenge that US President Joe Biden faces as his administration seeks to isolate Russia and cut its energy export revenues.
While many countries have banned or discouraged purchases from Russia, China, India and several African and Middle Eastern nations have increased imports.



 
Biden was on Friday visiting Saudi Arabia and was expected to seek an increase in oil supply to global markets from the kingdom to help to lower oil prices that have aggravated inflation worldwide.
There is little spare capacity for Saudi and others to increase production in the short term. Saudi Arabia has also maintained its cooperation with Russia in the alliance of global producers known as Opec+. The two are the de facto leaders of respectively Opec and non-Opec producers in that group.
Data obtained by Reuters through Refinitiv Eikon ship tracking showed Saudi Arabia imported 647,000 tonnes (48,000 barrels per day) of fuel oil from Russia via Russian and Estonian ports in April-June this year. That was up from 320,000 tonnes in the same period a year ago.
For the full year 2021, Saudi Arabia imported 1.05 million tonnes of Russian fuel oil.
Saudi Arabian and Russian energy ministries declined to comment on the increased imports.

6,Dollar hits Rs211,KARACHI: The US dollar resumed upward march against the rupee and reached almost Rs211 in the interbank market on...,"KARACHI: The US dollar resumed upward march against the rupee and reached almost Rs211 in the interbank market on Friday.
The greenback gained Rs1.15 to close at Rs210.95, up from  Rs209.80 a day earlier. On Thursday, The rupee recovered 30 paise against the dollar.
In the open market, the dollar price closed at Rs212. 
Currency dealers said the impact of the report about the Pakistan-International Monetary Fund deal vanished as the market is still dry without dollar inflows.
The government has announced a reduction in petroleum products but it was not taken seriously by the currency market since the amount reduced was no match compared to the price increases last month. 
The price of oil in the international market has been declining, which would help the country slash the import bill and that in turn may lead to reduced dollar demand.
