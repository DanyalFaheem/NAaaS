2,SC to hear PTI’s plea against changes to accountability law from 19th,Imran claims amendments will have effect of legitimising certain forms of corruption.,"ISLAMABAD: A three-member bench of the Supreme Court (SC) will commence hearing of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan’s petition, challenging the recent amendments to the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO) on Tuesday (July 19).
A bench will comprise Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah. It will take up the petition which Justice Ahsan had ordered placement before a bench for regular hearing in his chamber on July 6.
In its objection, the registrar office had returned the petition seeking to strike down the amendments made through the National Accountability (Second Amendment) Act 2022 for being ultra vires to the Constitution.
The PML-N-led coalition government introduced 27 key amendments to NAO but President Dr Arif Alvi did not accord his assent to it. However, the bill was later adopted in the joint sitting of parliament and notified.

Imran claims amendments will have effect of legitimising certain forms of corruption

In its petition, the PTI chairman argued that the amendments tended to scrap corruption cases against the prime minister, chief ministers and ministers and would provide an opportunity to already convicted public office-holders to get their conviction undone.
The amendments are tantamount to depriving the people of Pakistan of their right to having access to law to effectively question their chosen representatives in case of breach of their duty towards them, the petition argued, adding that the amendments would have the effect of legitimising certain forms of corruption and creating select islands of accountability to exclude from prosecution certain members of the parliament, including ministers and the prime minister.
Moreover, the word “benamidar” has been redefined making it difficult for the prosecution to prove someone as the fictitious owner of a property. Redefining “assets” was manifestly aimed at and will result in acquittal or discharge of all those holders of public office who are presently facing trial for offences of corruption, it added.
About the deletion of Section 14 of NAO, which provided for presumptions of guilt and shifting burden of proof on the accused person, the petition said this was inevitable to prevent commission of crime by holders of public office with impunity. After its omission, it becomes impossible for the prosecution to prove white collar crime against the holders of public office.
The petition also argued that the amendments were unreasonable and would defeat the purpose for which the law was enacted by restricting the prosecution from taking action against decisions taken by the prime ministers, ministers, cabinet members, members and officials of committees and subcommittees, State Bank of Pakistan and other bodies.
Under the amendments, according to the petition, NAO would move only to those cases of corruption where the concerned holder of public office had received a monetary gain as a result of decisions taken by the high office.
It said the amendments had not taken out of the ambit of accountability all such cases of corruption where the facts indisputably reveal that through the act of corruption, monetary, material or any other benefit had definitely been provided to a private person, but no evidence of receipt of a monetary gain by the holder of public office could be collected during investigation, thereby protecting both the ‘private person’ and the holder of public office from being prosecuted for their (proven) illegal gain provided by one to the other.
Likewise, the blanket immunity from prosecution given to officials of all regulatory bodies, regarding all matters decided by them, is also unreasonable, unconstitutional and against the very concept of accountability, in that most, if not all of these regulatory authorities, such as Nepra, SECP, the Competition Commission of Pakistan, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority which deal with matters vital to the financial interests and welfare of the people of Pakistan.
But by virtue of the amendments, officials associated with these regulatory authorities cannot be held accountable to the people of Pakistan even where decisions taken by them may be proved to be based on corruption or corrupt practices as defined in NAO 1999.

4,RCB plans to remove illegal structures built on nullahs,"ISLAMABAD: After heavy spell of rain after Eidul Azha, Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) on Friday started a survey...","ISLAMABAD: After heavy spell of rain after Eidul Azha, Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) on Friday started a survey to identify illegal structures constructed on nullahs and drains which created hurdle in smooth flow of rainwater.
It also removed illegal structures in three localities in cantonment areas including washrooms, backyards, rooms and at some places houses.
RCB Cantonment Executive Officer Imran Gulzar told Dawn that the people had constructed the illegal structures on nullahs and its banks in connivance with District Land Revenue department.
However, he said the civic body had started the survey of cantonment areas especially in Jan colony, Banaras Colony, Shalley Valley, Peshawar Road Lane 4, Westridge and adjoining areas to identify illegal structures and houses.
“We checked many houses in recent past and the residents produced legal documents issued to them by Patwaris (land Revenue officials). As it is not military land so the land revenue officials allocated the Fard to those who constructed houses on drains,” he said.
He said that due to encroachments on drains, the rainwater entered houses and shops and it destroyed the home appliances besides damaging structures.
He said the issue was presented to Station Commander and requested to ask Rawalpindi division commissioner and deputy commissioner to take necessary action or investigate how patwaris issued Fard to the people who made structures on nullahs or even on banks of nullahs.
“As per law, no building can be constructed on nullahs, drains, water channels and its banks. But in the past few years, such structures constructed without any check,” he said. He said that it was difficult for the civic body to demolish the structure in large number but we had no option but to remove them. 
“We have decided to remove such structures after monsoon as the building waste will further chock the nullahs,” he said.
He said the most vulnerable areas in cantonment was Jan Colony, Banaras Colony, Shallay Valley, Lane 4 Peshawar Road, Westridge, Chak Madad Khan and area near I.J. Principal Road. “We are making efforts to clear the nullah for the smooth flow of rainwater in coming days as Met Office has predicted another heavy spell of rain in the coming days,” he said.
Mr Gulzar said the RCB on Friday demolished structure on nullahs in Jan Colony, Shallay Valley and Banaras Colony as people constructed washrooms and rooms on nullahs. 
“In first phase, we cleared the drains from encroachments and obstacles and in the next phase after monsoon, we will launch a proper drive to clear cantonment areas from all kinds of encroachments,” he said.
On the other hand, the residents of the cantonment said that the civic body sanitation branch failed to clear the nullahs before the monsoon that was why heavy rain played havoc on Wednesday (July 13).
Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shehabaz directed Water and Sanitation Agency to help cantonment authorities in clearing the nullahs.

His style and iconic subjects embellished with a Thai touch included eagles, a tiger, rickshaw, peacocks, colourful flowers and green valleys besides other decorations. The impressions reflected diversity as well as similarities in cultures of the two countries.
Ambassador of Thailand Chakkrid Krachaiwong said: “This is quite a big canvas to showcase Pakistani talent. It is also an effort to preserve traditional Pakistani truck art. We particularly appreciate images on the wall as they remind us of places back home. The Thai long tail boat paintings are quite similar in style to Pakistani truck art. This wall represents the Pakistani people, the delicacies and some of the similarities and friendship between the two countries.”
“The launch of the wall painting is also an opportunity to show appreciation to our second home, Pakistan,” he added. The ambassador took the opportunity to demonstrate his artistic skills and added a finishing touch by painting a red heart on the image of a rickshaw.

“We understand that ‘Made in Pakistan’ footballs are famous world over. So we have also decided to design a football with the 70 year logo made from Thai rubber combined with Pakistani craftsmanship. The best thing about this football will be that it shows that Pakistan turns imported quality Thai rubber into an even better finished product,” he said.
