1,SC allows appeals against SHC order that suspended SPSC Act,"Court rules PMS, medical officers appointed through 2018 competitive exam will continue to serve...","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that the medical officers and the public servants in the provincial management services (PMS) who appeared in the 2018 Combined Competitive Examination (CCE) of the Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) and completed required training after their selection in Grades 16 and above will continue to serve in their respective jobs.
On June 3, 2021, the Hyderabad circuit bench of the Sindh High Court had suspended the Sindh Public Service Commission (SPSC) Act, 1989, in its present form declaring it ultra vires to the Constitution, and cancelled job test results of medical officers and CCE held in 2018.
A three-judge Supreme Court bench consisting of Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhel and Justice Ayesha Malik held that officers who passed their written examinations but could not be appointed due to alleged irregularities, will be considered and adjusted in the existing available or future vacancies whenever they accrue. But in the meanwhile SPSC will also condone if some candidates become overage in the wait.
The Supreme Court had taken up a set of appeals moved by the Sindh government as well as individual petitioners against the June 3, 2021 SHC judgement declaring the SPSC Act 1989, SPSC (Functions) Rules, 1990 and SPSC (Appointment of Chairman and Members) Rules 2017 against the Constitution.

Court rules PMS, medical officers appointed through 2018 competitive exam will continue to serve

On Tuesday, the apex court ruled that the SHC order regarding declaring the SPSC Act of 1989 had become infructous since the provincial government had subsequently promulgated the SPSC Act.
After declaring the SPSC Act 1989 ultra vires to the Constitution, the SHC had also set aside the job and test results of medical officers and CCE held in 2018. As a result of the SHC verdict, the recruitment of around 1,700 male and female medical and other government officers got affected.
Senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan represented certain officers of the PMS as well as Salahuddin Ahmed appeared on behalf of the medical officers.
In one of the petitions filed by Makhdoom Ali Khan on behalf of a number of provincial officers, the petitioners pleaded that they were condemned unheard since they were not parties to the proceedings before the SHC. Even no notices were ever issued to them or any opportunity of hearing was provided to them before the judgement was passed. As the results of CCE-2018 were set aside and cancelled without any discussion in the high court order, the petitioners pleaded that the high court’s verdict was based on the assumption that candidates were selected through CCE-2018 without a written test.
“This is incorrect and contrary to the record,” the petitioners contended, adding that they were selected through a transparent and lengthy process that included application, screening test, written tests or interview.
Upon selection by the SPSC, the petitioners said they were issued offer letters by the Sindh government on Jan 30, 2020, which were accepted by them. 
Later, they underwent medical examination and their character antecedents and educational testimonials were also verified, the petition said, adding that the high court’s verdict did not take into consideration that CSS examinations were conducted by the Federal Public Service Commission in the same manner as CCE-2018. This is apparent from the Rules for Competitive Examination (CSS), 2017 framed by FPSC.
The petition pleaded that the high court went beyond the prayer of the earlier petitioners, who had challenged the interview process of the SPSC for selection of women medical officers in BS-17.
That selection process was distinct from CCE-2018 — through which the petitioners were selected. The SHC, however, without any basis set aside and cancelled the results of CCE-2018.
There was not an iota of evidence before the SHC regarding irregularity in the selection process of CCE-2018, besides the judgement was based on conjectures and assumptions and the high court’s judgement decided disputed questions of fact when it was a settled law that the high courts, in exercise of constitutional jurisdiction, could not decide factual controversies.
The high court’s judgement was passed without taking into consideration the vested rights and legitimate expectation of the petitioners, the petitioners alleged.
The petitioners were highly qualified individuals, who participated in the lengthy process of CCE-2018 before being declared successful. “They have not only been posted in different government departments since their appointment but have also been undergoing training even some of them resigned from their previous jobs in order to participate in CCE-2018.”
The petitioners also pleaded that the high court’s order was passed the judgement in suo motu exercise of powers as none of the petitioners before the SHC challenged the validity of the 1989 Act, or the 2017 rules, the petitioners said.

2,Move to bar varsities from making appointments without CM’s approval questioned,Teachers to hold general body meeting at KU today...,"KARACHI: Confusion and concern prevails on university campuses across Sindh over the recently released notification that bars universities from initiating the process of any appointment without taking approval from the chief minister.
Speaking to Dawn, teachers questioned the ‘actual government intention’ behind the directives as it had issued a similar notification in 2019.
“Several appointments of both teaching and non-teaching staff were made by the then Karachi University acting vice chancellor [Prof Khalid Mehmood Iraqi] in 2019 and in subsequent years, but there was no objection from the government,” Prof Shah Ali-ul-Qader, said the president of the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association-Sindh chapter and the Karachi University Teachers’ Society.
Criticising the move, he said the universities were being run under the Sindh Universities and Institutes Laws (Amendment) Act, 2018, and it’s unfortunate on part of the government to send universities such directives.

Teachers to hold general body meeting at KU today

“Right now, the KU syndicate has 70 per cent representationof the government where officials can share their concerns on this forum without restricting the powers of the vice chancellor given in the act,” he explained, adding that a general body meeting of KU’s teaching and non-teaching staff would be held on Wednesday (today) to discuss the matter.
It might be recalled that the universities and boards department has recently sent a notification to 27 public sector universities of the province asking them “not to initiate any regular/contract appointments from BS-1 to BS-22 till the prior approval of the competent authority i.e the chief minister”.
While restricted autonomy had adversely affected all institutions of higher learning, sources said, its impact on KU was far greater where more than 400 faculty members had been awaiting their promotions for posts advertised in 2019, while many teachers awaiting promotions for years had retired.
At KU, there are currently 136 vacant posts for lecturer, 45 for assistant professor, 37 for associate professor and 110 vacant posts for professor. As a result, several departments are being run without chairpersons.
The total number of internal and external candidates who applied for these posts in response to the 2019 advertisement are between 5,000 and 6,000.
Prof Khalid Mehmood Iraqi, now KU vice chancellor, admitted that he made several appointments in 2019 and in subsequent years, but said, “as far as he remembered”, the 2019 notification imposed “an overall ban on appointments, including universities”.
“But, this one is specifically for universities. My appointments pertained to the teachers’ posts advertised in 2012, 2014 and 2016. Other appointments were of low-grade non-teaching staff,” he said.
Under the Sindh Universities and Institutes Laws (Amendment) Act, 2018, Prof Iraqi pointed out, the vice chancellor could make appointments from grade one to grade 16.
About the large number of KU teachers protesting for the long overdue promotion for posts advertised in 2019, he said, he couldn’t exactly recall whether approval for these posts had been taken from the chief minister or not.
In February this year, KU held one selection board on court’s order for a post advertised in 2019. But, the selection board was initially declared null and void by the secretary universities and boards on grounds that “KU hasn’t taken prior approval for the selection board from the chief minister”.
Sources said the selection board’s cancellation had no precedent in KU’s history. They also said that it was first time that the universities and boards secretary attended a meeting of the selection board. 
The university took permission from the government and the selection board was finally held last month after getting postponed thrice. 
Meanwhile, the KU Selection Board Action Committee, a body formed by teachers awaiting their promotions, held a token hunger strike in front of the administrative block.
They teachers demanded that the administration immediately announce a schedule for the selection boards pending since 2019.

Still, the day began with the change of guards ceremony at the Mazar-i-Quaid by cadets of the Pakistan Air Force Asghar Khan Academy.
The Corps Commander Karachi, Lt General Mohammed Saeed, also visited the Mazar-i-Quaid to pay homage to the Father of the Nation and lay a floral wreath before penning his remarks in the visitors’ book. 
He also visited the grave of Captain Taha Murtaza Hashmi (Shaheed) followed by his visiting the residence of Nk Amjad Ali Shah Bukhari (Shaheed).

Speaking at a press conference at the central relief camp of the party at Idara Noor-i-Haq and later while visiting a shelter facility of the affected people, he said that the government took notice of the situation and started acting only after the global community started offering financial assistance.
He said the financial assistance that came in for the victims of 2005 earthquake fell prey to corruption. This should not be the case and the ruling regime refrain itself from political distribution of the foreign aid, he added.
The JI leader said the political parties in the country were taking this calamity as an opportunity for politics and point scoring. 
He reminded the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz that it was the ruling party and should not participate in the race of political conventions. “Instead, the government should focus on the flood-affected people and mobilising its resources for relief and rehabilitation of the victims,” he added.
He hailed the role of the party’s welfare wing, Al-Khidmat, and people engaged in relief work, but made it clear that despite all the serious efforts, donations and work, these organisations were not a substitute for the government and its resources.

Cradling her baby at the camp set up in Sports Complex in the city, Ms Rehana said that she had started feeling labour pain when floodwaters coming from Balochistan raged through her village Bandhi in Mehar taluka.  
She stood watching helplessly her three goats and two cows being carried away by the floodwaters and houses crumbling before her eyes. She could not have saved herself from drowning if her husband had not been there. He helped her wade through floodwaters for 29 kilometres from the village to Suprio dyke, which was the only nearest elevated place to take refuge on, she said.  
But soon afterwards water level rose along the dyke and led to breaches, forcing them once again to take flight to Dadu city along with other flood victims where she gave birth to her baby boy without the help of any doctor, she said.  
She said that she used to be quite well off but flood had destroyed everything and reduced her to begging in the city to feed her starving children.  
Mujeeb Chandio, Rehana’s husband, said that he had named his newborn son Sabir Hussain. When the floodwaters directly hit his home, he grabbed his three-year-old son, sat him on his shoulders and helped his pregnant wife wade through water towards the dyke as briskly as they could, he said. 
He said that her wife and both sons, the baby and the toddler, were ill but no doctor had arrived at the camp so far to treat them.

9,"No miscreant should be allowed to breach dykes,  SHC tells officials",LARKANA: The Larkana circuit bench of the Sindh High Court on Tuesday ordered deputy commissioners of Larkana...,"LARKANA: The Larkana circuit bench of the Sindh High Court on Tuesday ordered deputy commissioners of Larkana division to constitute citizen committees and establish tent cities in all talukas of the division, and asked the officers concerned to ensure that no miscreant breached dykes of any saline water and sewage drain and water channel. 
The bench comprising Justices Naimatullah Phulpoto and Khadim Hussain Tunio passed the order on a petition filed by two advocates, Rafiq Ahmed K. Abro and Sarfraz Khan Jatoi, seeking tents, food and medicines for the rain and flood victims.  
The court said the citizen committees should also be formed in the talukas of Mehar and Khairpur Nathan Shah and all the committees should be headed by civil judges.  
The bench asked district and session judges to notify the committees and observed after hearing additional advocate general (AAG), commissioner and other officers concerned that unprecedented rains and flood had caused destruction of property, public health infrastructure, loss of lives and damage to certain portions of Indus Highway.  
It said that millions of people in the province had sustained substantial damage to their houses, crops and livestock in the absence of a proper system to rescue the rain victims and provide them food, tents, potable water and health facilities in all talukas of the province, particularly Lar­kana division. 
The officials had failed to provide shelters equipped with basic facilities to internally displaced persons (IDPs), who were forced to live under open sky along roads in squalid conditions after finding no other recourse, it said.  
The officials who were present in the court claimed that they had rescued and provided basic facilities to the victims but the petitioners contested their claim saying that ground realities were entirely different as the IDPs were crying for food, health facilities and shelter, which were their fundamental rights, they said.  
The court was informed that some influential persons were breaching dykes of water channels to serve their interests without caring for the rain victims and thus adding to their miseries.  
It directed the National High­way Authority to restore traffic on the Indus Highway, which had become impassable at certain points, causing great inconvenience to general public. 
The court asked DCs of Larkana, Qambar-Shahdadkot, Shikarpur, Jacobabad and Kashmore-Kan­dhkot districts to establish one or more tent cities in their talukas to provide shelter to scattered IDPs.  
The bench ordered the Provincial Disaster Management Authority to ensure food, clean water, clothes and other basic facilities, including washrooms to the IDPs and take action against misappropriation, pilferage and sale of relief items meant for the victims.  
The district and session judges concerned would supervise the steps taken by the officials, said the order. 
The court ordered the DCs, district health officers, superintendent engineer of irrigation, public health department officials to personally appear in the court along with compliance reports on Sept 8.  
As the petition come up for hearing, Larkana commissioner along with all five DCs of Larkana, Jacobabad, Shikarpur, Qambar-Shahdadkot and Kashmore and other officers concerned appeared before the judges and two of the respondents filed comments while Additional Advocate General sought more time to file the rest of the comments.

10,Murad says efforts being made to drain rainwater from fields ahead of wheat sowing,KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday said that his government was trying to drain out...,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday said that his government was trying to drain out accumulated rainwater from agricultural lands so that wheat crop could be sown to avoid a famine-like situation in the province.  
He was talking to a high-powered delegation of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) led by UAE’s Red Crescent, Relief & Rehabilitation Secretary Hamoud Abdulla Aljeibi. The team included UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Alzaabl, Consul General Bakheet Ateeg Alremeithi and the head of international communication, UAE Red Crescent, Rashed Alhammadi, 
The CM said the rainwater coming down the hills of Balochistan was still causing havoc in various districts of the province, particularly Shahdadkot, Dadu and Jamshoro, and the number of people being rendered homeless was increasing day by day due to breaches in Manchhar Lake and some drains. 
Mr Shah said the drains like Left Bank Outfall Drain (LBOD) and Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD), and various embankments would have to be reconstructed once the catastrophe was over. “We are still working on rescue and then would start rehabilitation in which the international community would have to come over,” he said. 
He said the provincial government had to rehabilitate over 1.5 million people and restore 3,172,726 acres of land for Rabi crops, particularly wheat. “Otherwise, food shortage would emerge,” he said and added that it was a gigantic task for which the international community would have to support the Sindh government.  
The CM said that agricultural machinery, fertilizer, seed and technology would be arranged to help growers start sowing wheat. “Our wheat is the most important Rabi crop, which was badly needed to meet the food requirement of the province,” he said.  
The CM was assisted by provincial ministers Nasir Shah and Mukesh Kumar Chawla, CM’s adviser on rehabilitation Rasool Bux Chandio, Chief Secretary Sohail Rajput, special secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh and rehabilitation secretary Asif Memon. 
Briefing the UAE delegation, the chief secretary said that over one million tents, three million mosquito nets, kitchen sets, mosquito nets for animals, ration bags, and drinking water were needed. 
Mr Aljeibi told the CM that his government was ready to support the people of Pakistan, particularly of Sindh, who had suffered a lot. 
He said that a programme was being organised on Sept 10 in Dubai to raise funds for the flood-affected people of Sindh. 
Mr Aljeibi said different consignments of relief goods would be sent for the affected people. “We are arranging more tents, mosquito nets, medicines, and other required material so that the original need can be met,” he said. 
In another meeting, an agreement was signed with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ Assistant Repre­sentative (Protection) for Pakistan Ms Leyla Nugmanova to receive goods for the rain-affected people. 
The goods include 310,000 blankets, 76,000 buckets, 56,500 jerrycans, 18,800 family tents, 67,500 plastic tarpaulins, 112,000 sleeping mats, 150,000 mosquito nets, 140,000 solar lamps, 24,700, kitchen sets, 32,000 sanitary napkins, 4,500 soap and 3,500 dignity kits. 
On behalf of the Sindh government, Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Salman Shah signed the pact. 
The UNHCR assistant representative told the chief minister that they were assessing the situation and would further support the provincial government to meet the humanitarian crisis.

11,"More female doctors needed in flood-hit areas, says Sindh minister",Azra Pechuho says thousands of vulnerable women and children not comfortable with being treated by men.,"KARACHI: Highlighting the challenges faced by the government in the flood-hit areas, Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho said on Tuesday that hundreds and thousands of vulnerable women and children who required healthcare were not comfortable being treated by men and there was a dire need for more female doctors. 
Lack of access to flood-hit areas, the minister pointed out, was still a big challenge, and was adversely affecting relief efforts.
“The disaster was beyond everyone’s imagination. Our health infrastructure, crops, irrigation system, IT facilities and road network have been destroyed and countless people are now homeless,” the provincial health minister told journalists at a press conference here at the Sindh Assembly’s Committee Room No 1.
“We have more than enough medicines. But, the issue is lack of access that many government workers and non-government organisations engaged in relief work are facing. People are forced to drink contaminated water while standing water has become a source of illness,” she explained.
About lack of coordination among relief agencies, she said: “Right now it’s not possible to work in a coordinated way,” adding that everyone had to come forward and help in whatever way possible.
According to the minister, the doctors who performed duties in the Covid-19 pandemic had been mobilised for flood relief while the Punjab government had also sent seven teams of healthcare professionals, including male and female doctors, paramedics and nurses. 
The minister feared the flood-hit areas might also see an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) as a large number of livestock had arrived from flood-affected parts of Balochistan to Sindh.
Sharing data of the internally displaced persons (IDPs), she said the estimated number of female IDPs was 2,583,003 and the number of pregnant IDPs stood at 102,520, whereas 891 pregnant women were in the shelter camps. More than 70,000 patients, the minister said, were being treated at the medical campus daily. 
“Since July, health teams have treated over 800,000 people in flood-affected areas where acute respiratory disease, diarrhoeal diseases, suspected malaria, skin infections, snake and dog bites are common.”
The press conference was attended by parliamentary secretary of health Qasim Siraj Soomro, among others.

12,Severe water shortage hits Karachi's DHA after weeks-long flooding,Many localities in Defence receive water mixed with sewage; CBC blames KWSB for crisis.,"KARACHI: While it is common knowledge that residents of Karachi’s posh Defence Housing Authority are always complaining about water shortage, it was hoped that the rise in the water table following the recent monsoon rains would see an improvement in supply but nothing of the sort has happened so far.  
For DHA residents it is a case of ‘water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink’ from Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which speaks about water everywhere but undrinkable because it is not clean or safe enough to drink.  
Nadir Jamal, a resident of Phase 2 told Dawn that they received some water, once in three weeks, from the pipeline. “And we have silently accepted this as the Cantonment Board Clifton [CBC] says that they are not getting enough water from the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board [KWSB]. Meanwhile, Clifton and PECHS are getting enough water,” he said.  
“In fact, water in Clifton is overflowing from their underground tanks all the time and due to this their road surfaces have also become rough and brittle,” he pointed out.  

Many localities in Defence receive water mixed with sewage; CBC blames KWSB for crisis

Sikandar Kazi, another resident of Phase 2, said that he was a very old resident of the area. “Many years ago, we used to get sufficient water, three times a week but things started changing some 15 years ago when we started getting water twice a week and then once a week. Now it is once or twice a month bringing on an acute water shortage,” he said.  
“DHA used to be a big and well-planned housing society keeping in consideration the number of folks per house and their water needs. But it seems like those plans have been chucked out the window. It is not possible for a family of five to live on 2,000 gallons a month,” he said.  
“We are told by the CBC that the KWSB is the culprit here but we are the third party here. What can we do about it? CBC should handle them and make sure that we get our supply.  
“Now the KWSB has all kinds of problems such as maintenance work needed for their filtration plants or pumping stations. Sometimes there is a breakage in their supply lines. When that happened recently, our supply was just stopped. There are also things being said such as the KWSB deliberately breaking their lines in order to facilitate the tanker mafia, a cut of the money whom goes to the provincial government,” he said.  
“And since DHA residents can afford tankers during any kind of water shortage, we are also in a way facilitating the tanker mafia. Our buying power is hurting us while if the same things happens in Clifton or PECHS, they will conserve water and not immediately go for buying water from tankers,” he explained.  
“The thing is that CBC charges us the amount for our water one year in advance. But it should be a fee, not a tax. Also they charge this amount more for a 1,000 sq yard property and less for a 500 sq yard property. But whatever the size of our property and whatever amount we pay, we are not getting water through the lines,” he added.  
Another resident of Phase 6, Kamran Khan, said that the water that they were getting from the lines was simply sewerage water. “We had to block our line because the water coming through it was gutter water. Other than that we have had no water since July 4,” he said.  
“Actually, the gutter lines have been choked so the sewerage water is overflowing on the roads, too,” he said. “My house is located on 5th Street, Off Khayaban-i-Sehr and there is an empty plot on the 4th Street where a gutter line has collapsed due to which all the residents are getting gutter supply instead of water supply through their water pipeline,” he explained.  
One more resident from the same area, Syed A.H. Jafri, who is also a resident of 5th Street off Sehr said that he did not get any water though the pipelines for two years “but after the rains we are getting water quite regularly from the line. However, it smells and tastes horrible. We understand that it may be contaminated water so we are using chlorine tablets to make it safe,” he said.  
Mehdi Abbas, a resident of 23rd Street in Phase 5, said that they also got water through the lines only twice a month. “And that, too, only for one hour, which amounts to nothing. It doesn’t fulfil our household needs unless we arrange for a tanker,” he said.  
“And sometimes the water that we get through the pipeline is mixed with sewage, but no action is taken regarding this issue even after complaining to the CBC. I have had to get my water tanks cleaned due to this,” he said.   
Meanwhile, engineer Morawala, a resident of Phase 7 Extension said that he was not even given a water pipeline what to complain of no water coming through the pipelines.  
In reply to all these complaints, the CBC issued a notification to their residents, explaining that a 72-inch diameter bulk water pipeline of the KWSB at the Dhabeji Pumping Station had burst on August 29 due to which water supply was stopped although now repair-work on it had been done and the water supply also had been resumed. The notification also ended with a request to all CBC residents to save water and use it carefully.  
CBC clarifies 
A CBC spokesman also told Dawn that according to a MoU which they had signed with the KWSB for provision of water supply to DHA in 1999, they were supposed to be getting nine million gallons per day (MGD) of water. “Now with the growth in population here in 2022, the demand for water in DHA is 16 to 17MGD and we are being supplied with only three to four MGD by the KWSB. It is this gap, which is preventing us from supplying water to our esteemed residents. I also want to point out here that we are not defaulters even by a penny in KWSB’s monthly bills,” he said. 
“Even if they supplied us with nine MGD, we would have supplied water on alternate days or something to our residents but we are not even getting that much,” he said. 
Asked about the KWSB joining hands with the tanker mafia, the spokesman said that it could very well be happening at KWSB’s hydrants. “Maybe they are selling water. But they are not giving it to us. Otherwise we would be more than happy to supply water through the pipelines to our residents,” he concluded.

13,Jail term of ‘IS militant’ upheld in extortion case,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday upheld the conviction and jail terms handed down by an antiterrorism court...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday upheld the conviction and jail terms handed down by an antiterrorism court to a man linked to militant Islamic State (IS) group.
An ATC had sentenced Sikandar Khan to five years in prison as well as other sentences of imprisonment in August last year for demanding protection money from a doctor and terrorising him by opening fire and hurling explosives at his clinic in February 2020 in the Old Sabzi Mandi area.
The convict filed appeals against his conviction in both the cases and after hearing arguments and examining the record and proceedings, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha dismissed the appeals and maintained the conviction order of the ATC.
The bench observed that based on the acts and conduct of the appellant as well as facts and circumstances of the case, the offence fell within the ambit of the Anti-Terrorism Act as he had demanded extortion, and along with his accomplices, also fired at the clinic and used an explosive device with an intention of terrorising the doctor/complainant for refusing to pay protection money.
The appellant was arrested on the spot and an unlicensed weapon was also found in his custody and as per a ballistic report, the weapon was matched with the empty bullet casings found at the crime scene, the bench said, adding that the prosecution had proved its cases against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.
According to the prosecution, the appellant, along with his accomplice, came at the clinic of Dr Sirajuddin on Feb 14, 2020 and handed over an envelope to his nephew asking him to deliver it to the complainant.
The envelope contained demand of protection money from IS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Quraishi. On Feb 27, the appellant along with three accomplices again came at the clinic and hurled explosive substance, it added.

14,Two Iranian gang members robbing air passengers killed in ‘encounter’,City police chief concedes upsurge in crimes; says law-enforcers are now in ‘pro-active mode’...,"KARACHI: Police on Tuesday claimed to have killed two members of a gang, which used to loot international airline passengers, in an encounter in Gulshan-i-Jamal on complaint of a robbery victim while the suspects’ third alleged accomplice was arrested in wounded condition.  
Addressing a press conference, Karachi police chief Additional Inspector General Javed Odho described it as an ‘Iranian gang’ as its members spoke the Dari language though they belong to Afghanistan and some locals were also its members.  
Sharing details, he said that an encounter took place between police and alleged robbers near Millennium Mall early in the morning where after an exchange of gunfire, two alleged robbers Jasim, 21, and Yaseen, 25, were gunned down while third suspect Ali Amjad, 22, was arrested in wounded condition and their fourth accomplice Arif escaped.  
The dead and injured were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.  

City police chief concedes upsurge in crimes; says law-enforcers are now in ‘pro-active mode’

The police recovered three TT pistols, one laptop and one civic car.  
At the press conference, the robbery victim, Ali, told the media that his maternal nephew along with his family had arrived from Istanbul on Tuesday. They came out from airport at 4am and were on their way to home in Scheme-33 when four armed robbers intercepted them from wrong side. They used abusive language and beat them and fled after snatching cash and other valuables.  
However, the robbers did not snatch his cell phone. He quickly informed Madadgar-15 and the Gulshan SP took its notice. The citizen said within 15 minutes he received a call from Aziz Bhatti SHO Adeel informing him that two suspects had been killed while the third one was held. He was asked to come and identify them near Millennium Mall.  
He said he identified the robbers.  
The police chief said Ali had told the police that dacoits in the silver Honda Civic looted his three bags, Rs15,000 and $800 at DUHS near Mosmiyat.  
The officer said a picket was set up to intercept the suspects and when an approaching car was signalled to stop at NIPA, they opened indiscriminate fire on police and sped away.  
The police went after them and during hot pursuit the encounter took place in which two dacoits were killed, third one was held while the fourth one escaped. The recovered car bore a fake number plate, he added.  
Suspect Jasim, an undertrial, was a resident of Metroville in Banaras and six criminal cases were registered against him in Gulberg, Gulistan Jauhar, Jauharabad, Malir Cantt, Nazimabad and Shahrah Noorjehan in 2021, the police chief added.  
He got bail in five cases while in sixth case he was acquitted.  
The police chief clarified that recently a clip went viral on social media that international passengers were unsafe, but it was six months old incident in which the suspects were also taken to task.  
He regretted that some suspects got bail and indulged again in crimes. He admitted that there was an upsurge in crimes, but the police were now in ‘pro-active mode’.  
He said a suspect wounded in an encounter in Gulshan on Monday was arrested when he attempted to get treatment from a hospital on Tuesday.  
He said this gang was involved in seven heinous crimes and further investigation was under way.  
The Mobina Town police registered an FIR under Section 395 against the gang members.

15,‘Undocumented’ flows from Manchhar boggle Kotri Barrage chief,Kotri Barrage chief engineer seeks statistics of last 10 days after higher than calculated peak passed on Monday.,"HYDERABAD: The Kotri Barrage chief engineer has urged the irrigation secretary and chief engineer of Sukkur Barrage’s right bank canals that the data regarding release of quantum of water from Manchhar Lake over the last 10 days be shared with his office so that any mishap could be avoided and safety of the vital structure (Kotri Barrage) could be ensured.
CE Haji Khan Jamali, it is learnt, has sent such wire to the officials yesterday (Sept 5) in view of floodwater discharges observed at Kotri Barrage on the day.
According to the wire, Sukkur Barrage had released a flow of 579,000 cusecs on Aug 25 but Kotri Barrage received 603,000 cusecs upstream on Sept 5 — up by 40,000 if calculation at the Kotri Barrage were anything to go by. He wrote that water flows were released from Manchhar Lake without intimation to the Kotri Barrage region.
Kotri Barrage received a flow of 603,327 cusecs upstream and flow of 584,272 cusecs was passed downstream on Monday at 6pm. This peak passed through the barrage till today (Tuesday) with a discharge of 604,147 cusecs upstream and 583,822 cusecs downstream recorded at 6pm.

CE seeks statistics of last 10 days after higher than calculated peak passed on Monday

Guddu Barrage continued to record a declining trend in discharge with 247,922 cusecs upstream and 244,342 cusecs downstream. Sukkur barrage is now in high flood with a discharge of 388,122 cusecs upstream and 388,122 cusecs downstream. 
Kotri Barrage’s off-taking canals — seven in all — are closed and, therefore, the up and downstream discharges remained the same. No withdrawal of water was being made at canals.
CE Jamali explained that “in fact everyone knows flows from Manchhar Lake are ending up in Indus river through Aral Wah; these flows, however, remain unaccounted for since they are not brought on record”.
He said that the purpose of sending this canal wire was necessary so that in future all such discharges were reflected in statistics to enable the Kotri Barrage management to have a clear idea of upcoming flows.
“I had expected a peak flow of 500,000-550,000 cusecs at the [Kotri] Barrage while seeing 579,000 cusecs flow Sukkur Barrage downstream flow of Aug 25 after 10pc travelling losses. The percentage of losses between Sukkur and Kotri are on a higher side in normal conditions given time lag and bed’s width between two barrages,” he said.
But, he said, flows at Kotri Barrage had increased substantially to hit a flow of 604,000 cusecs which did not tally with the calculation done at barrage. “Flows from Manchhar Lake were not brought on record, but it is necessary to make this a permanent practice in future. It will enable the authorities concerned to have correct estimates of flows and make arrangements for flood-fighting accordingly because densely population cities run parallel to the Kotri Barrage.
Gauges to be examined at Aral Wah
To a query, Mr Jamali said he had asked his director hydrology, Habib Ursani, to measure gauges at Aral’s head and tail regu­la­tors of Manchhar lake. “The officer will be reaching the point as he is returning from upper Sindh. After examining the gauge, he will be recording the flows,” he said.
Mr Jamali’s contention was that the lake’s flows joining Indus river near Sehwan needed to be brought on record and they should not remain ‘unknown flows’ in future. “Flows from Manchhar Lake need to be documented in future,” he stressed.
Meanwhile, an increase of just 1,000 cusecs was reported at Kotri Barrage between 6pm Monday (603,327 cusecs upstream) and 6am Tuesday (604,147 cusecs upstream). According to Mr Jamali, it’s ‘local waters’ that entered Indus river at some location. Since 6am, the flow at upstream remained unchanged till 6pm today.
Kotri Barrage has a designed discharge capacity of 875,000 cusecs. It passed a flow of 939,442 cusecs downstream (on Aug 27, 2010) during super floods after receiving a flow of 964,897 cusecs upstream.
Then in 2015 floods, the barrage passed a high flood of 603,084 cusecs downstream and received 634,919 cusecs upstream.
