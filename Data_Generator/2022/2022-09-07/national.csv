0,PTI given ‘last chance’ to reply to ECP notice,Prohibited funding case set to be heard on Sept 19.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commis­sion of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday gave Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) ‘a last chance’ to submit its reply to the commission’s show cause notice in the prohibited funding case, commonly referred to as the foreign funding case.
A four-member bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, which took up the case, gave two more weeks to the PTI, making it clear that it would not be extended any further.
The commission asked the PTI to do the needful in time and set Sept 19 as the next date of hearing.
The hearing was last adjourned on August 23, with the commission giving more time to the PTI to file the reply.

Prohibited funding case set to be heard on Sept 19

PTI’s counsel Shah Khawar informed the ECP that he was busy in the Supreme Court on the last hearing of the case and asked the ECP for more time as he has to get some information from the PTI’s foreign chapter, including National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (NICOP) and other related documents.
“What is the status of the required information and where has your record reached?” asked the chief election commissioner. In his reply, the PTI counsel requested the ECP to give him a couple of weeks to submit the reply.
A member of the bench chided the PTI for its delaying tactics by asking whether this would also take eight years, alluding to the foreign funding case against the PTI which was filed in Nov 2014 and decided on Aug 2 this year.
The PTI lawyer said he wanted to provide the ECP regular documents, but the chief election commissioner directed the lawyer to submit the reply before two weeks so that on the next hearing of the case, arguments could be started.
It is interesting to note that on Aug 23 hearing, the PTI lawyer had sought two weeks’ time to give a comprehensive reply and the election commission had adjourned the hearing till Sept 6.
On Aug 2, the ECP had announced the verdict in the case. The commission said that it had been proved that the PTI had received the funding from prohibited sources.
The ECP judgment said that the PTI had received prohibited funding from the US and Canada besides receiving funds from Wootton Cricket Limited. Moreover, the judgment said the PTI also took funds from 34 foreigners, including Arif Naqvi, Abraaj Group and others.
Subsequently, after a few days, a show-cause notice was issued to the PTI Chairman Imran Khan with a directive to appear before the ECP on August 23.
The case was filed by PTI founding member Akbar S. Babar, alleging serious financial irregularities in the party’s funds received from foreign countries.

PESHAWAR: PTI supporters gesture as they listen to Imran Khan’s speech on Tuesday.—White Star

 
ISLAMABAD: As PTI Chairman Imran Khan was about to address a rally in Peshawar on Tuesday evening, YouTube became inaccessible at most of the Inter­net Service Providers or ISP.
Several users complained that they were having issues accessing the popular video streaming platform, particularly on the web.
NetBlocks — a company tracking internet network disruptions and shutdowns — confirmed that the service was disrupted in the country.
“Metrics corroborate rep­orts of a new disruption to YouTube in Pakistan, the incident comes as former PM Imran Khan appears on screen to live stream a speech on the platform, following a pattern observed in August,” the company said in a tweet.
Meanwhile, digital rights activist Usama Khilji also confirmed the reports that the service was inaccessible for some users.
He added that the PTA was blocking the service “at the gateway level” using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) technology.
The PTA had acquired DPI from Canadian company, Sandvine, allowing it to directly block websites, without directing the ISPs to do so, according to Mr Khilji.
Talking to Dawn, Punjab IT minister Dr Arslan Khalid said that Mr Khan’s live speeches are banned on electronic media, and it is usually witnessed that when he addresses the public, YouTube is made unavailable in the country.
Calling it a “major loss for the economy” Mr Khalid added such disruptions wea­ken investors’ confidence as they become wary of inconsistent government policies.
Former information minister Chaudhary Fawad Hussain also crticised the action, saying that the country has been “officially turned into a banana republic”.
Not only the PTI leaders, but PPP Secretary General Farhatullah Babar also expressed his reservations over the move, and said: “A man may be imprisoned but not an idea.”
This is not the first time the the service faced disruption around the same time as PTI chief’s address On Aug 21, when Mr Khan was addressing a rally in Rawalpindi’s Liaquat Bagh, YouTube faced disruptions.
NetBlocks’ analysis showed that the website was accessible on only a handful of networks.

Addressing a ceremony to mark Defence Day, at the Martyrs Monu­ment in Shakarparian the prime minister said spirit of sacrifice and resilience shown during the 1965 war was required to cope with destruction caused by floods.
Terming the floods “unprecedented catastrophe,” the premier added that the citizens and armed forces are united in coping with the challenge.
The prime minister termed unity as the greatest strength of the nation as over 30 million people were facing immense hardship and financial losses due to floods.
Recalling the war, the prime minister said the armed forces and the people had thwarted India’s machinations to undermine the national integrity.
He also offered fateha and paid tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives for the safety and security of the nation.
Speaking to the media, Mr Sharif hailed the sacrifices of Maj Aziz Bhatti, Maj Shabbir Sharif, Squadron Leader Sarfaraz Rafiqui, Maj Muhammad Ziauddin Uppal and others who had sacrificed their lives during the war.
“The whole nation comes together today in paying homage to our martyrs and Ghazis who put their lives on the line to defend the motherland against Indian aggression. Together our armed forces and people thwarted the Indian machinations to undermine our territorial integrity,” the PM said later in a tweet.
This year’s Defence Day was commemorated with a simple ceremony as the regular ceremony was called off due to the devastation caused by floods.
In a separate development, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs has made a donation of Rs70 million to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund.

3,"Blindness, vision problems on the decline, survey shows",Number of unsighted persons drops by one-third in 15 years.,"ISLAMABAD: The pre­valence of blindness and vision impairment among people aged 50 and above in Pakistan has reduced re­­markably, from seven per cent to around two per cent, a survey by federal Ministry of Health shows.
The results of ‘Third Na­­tional Survey of Blindness’, conducted between 2019-2021, were announced in a ceremony on Tuesday.
According to the survey, 9,028,073 people in the country have vision impairment — ranging from mild impairment to permanent blindness. Out of them, 484,027 are blind, down from 1.5 million in 2004, when the survey was last conducted.
The prevalence of blindness was found to be higher in females with 2.07pc as compared to 1.98pc in males, revealed Prof Asad Aslam Khan who is the National Coordinator of Prevention of Blindness Programme in Pakistan. The overall number was 2.02pc.

Number of unsighted persons drops by one-third in 15 years

The survey has linked blindness to untreated cataract (49pc), while 51pc ca­­ses are a result of glauco­ma, corneal opacity, un­­cor­rec­ted aphakia, macular deg­e­neration and diabetic reti­nopathy. The main cause of vision impairment was refractive error (11.9pc).
Blindness due to cataract was down from 55pc to 49pc, the data showed.
Briefing about the sample size, Prof Khan, who is also chairman of National Committee for Eye Health, said around 44,800 individuals aged 50 and above were included in the survey conducted in 16 different districts.
He added that the objective of the survey was to estimate the prevalence of blindness and vision imp­a­i­­rment amongst people aged 50 and above and to identify its causes as people from this age group comprise 80pc of all cases of blindness and vision impairment.
Addressing the cerem­ony, Parliamentary Secre­tary Health Dr Shazia Som­roo called the results “very encouraging” as she linked the positive trend to effective public-private partnership.
After the 2004 survey, the National Committee for Eye Health (NCEH) and federal health ministry prepared and executed two five-year plans for prevention of blindness in collaboration with INGOs and local organisations.
Between 2004 and 2020, College of Ophthalmology was established at Mayo Hospital, Lahore while eye departments in 32 teaching hospitals, 122 district headquarter hospitals and more than 150 tehsil headquarter hospitals were est­ablished across the country.
Director General Minis­try of Health Dr Shabana Saleem said serious efforts were needed to bring down the prevalence of blindness and vision impairment and assured that the ministry would conduct more surveys in the future.
According to the data, blindness and vision impairment results in financial losses of $270bn due to productivity loss.

IT was 46 years ago, in 1976 to be precise, that the first Balochi film Hammal O Mahganj was made. Produced by Anwar Iqbal, who afterwards became a known actor, the movie was not allowed to screen in cinema halls. It was mired in controversy, apparently, for not being truthful to Baloch culture.
Thankfully, especially ever since ‘visual studies’ has been introduced as a discipline at various educational institutions, young Baloch filmmakers are coming to the fore, making top-drawer documentaries and short films.
Against this backdrop and given the fact that the pandemic has slowed down, if not stymied, the revival of the Pakistani film industry, the countrywide release last week of the full-length Balochi feature film, Doda — directed by Adil Bizanjo — assumes considerable significance.
The film’s director describes the plot thus: “Doda tells the tale of a young boxer who lives in Lyari. He wants to attain international fame as a pugilist.
But there are myriads of obstacles in his way to success set by society. The story basically focuses on how he overcomes those obstacles and moves forward. It is a realism-based narration, very rooted. There is no glamour in it.”
Boxing appears to be a recurring theme for shorts and features based in Lyari. It is obvious that the residents of one of the oldest neighbourhoods in Karachi love the sport. Bizanjo said, “The people of Lyari love boxing. I don’t think it has not been shown in our media the way it merits. However, boxing is just one part of Doda’s plot.”
On the challenges that he faced while making the film, the director said for independent filmmakers, the budget is always a major issue. Plus, taking the film to cinema halls, i.e. getting the cinemas to screen it, was also difficult.
The pandemic, too, put a halt to filming for more than a year.
Balochi is Bizanjo’s mother tongue. He’s comfortable making films in the Balochi language.
Another reason that he’s told the story in his mother tongue was to familiarise (aashna kerna) the mainstream media with it. Still, the project has also been dubbed in Urdu for cinemas in Punjab, KP and Sindh.
Shoaib Hasan plays the eponymous hero in Doda. Talking about his character, he told Dawn, “My role is of a sportsman from Lyari. He wants to make it big [internationally]. His younger sister also wishes the same for him. But something terrible happens which alters the course of his actions.”
Hasan trained for three months as a boxer to prepare for the part. He claimed he worked very hard to make his performance come across as close-to-life.
In the process, he was helped by his fellow actors and technicians.
The rest of the cast includes Abila Kurd (who plays Hasan’s love interest), Fiza Bibi, Imran Baloch, Shakoor Baloch and Anwar Iqbal. Doda was one of Iqbal’s last acting assignments before his death on July 1, 2021.

5,PDMA to work in concert with NGOs in Balochistan,"""Since Pakistan is not a developed country, it cannot cope with this emergency alone,"" CM's adviser says.","QUETTA: The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) of Balochistan will coordinate with the non-governmental organisations engaged in flood relief so that they could reach the regions where their assistance was needed the most, the chief minister’s adviser on Home and Tribal Affairs said after a meeting with the NGO heads on Tuesday.
The representatives of NGOs briefed Mir Ziaullah Langove, the adviser, about their work in different districts.
Mir Langove later told a press conference that rains and floods had robbed the poor of their livelihood and displaced over 1.5 million people.
“Since Pakistan is not a developed country, it cannot cope with this emergency alone. Balochistan badly needs assistance from NGOs because it’s the least developed province in the country,” Mir Langove said.
He said although rains had abated, vast areas were still under water and rescue teams were unable to reach out to millions of marooned people in the province.
However, Mir Langove added, the Army and the administration had joined hands to rescue them through helicopters.
“I hope rescue teams will do their best to provide food items and drinking water to the people stranded in Nasirabad division,” the adviser said.
He said the funds allocated by the prime minister for flood victims should be used to provide relief to those in dire need. “The National Disaster Management Authority has a huge responsibility and the nation is looking up to it in these desperate times.”
A number of dangerous diseases have broken out in several districts of the province, compounding the challenge the Balochistan government has on its hands, Mir Langove observed.
Chief secretary in Nasirabad
Balochistan Chief Secretary Abdul Aziz Uqaili visited the flood-affected districts of Nasirabad division on Tuesday. Local Government Secretary Dostain Khan Jamaldini and Agriculture Secretary Umid Ali accompanied him.
Deputy commissioners of the division briefed the chief secretary about relief operations in their districts.
The meeting was told the floods had destroyed all standing crops in the province’s green belt and rendered hundreds of thousands of people homeless.
The chief secretary said the provincial government had decided to set up tent cities in the affected areas so that homeless people could stay there pending their rehabilitation. “Provision of essential items to people living in camps must be ensured,” Mr Uqaili said.
The health department has set up medical camps near camp sites and the livestock department has pitched in by providing facilities for treatment of sick animals, the chief secretary added.

7,Balochistan govt appoints female deputy commissioner,It is the first time in the province's administrative history that a female officer has been appointed as DC.,"

Ayesha Zehri

 
QUETTA: The Balochistan government on Tuesday appointed a female officer to serve as deputy commissioner of Nasirabad district with an immediate effect replacing the outgoing deputy commissioner Mohammad Hussain.
Engineer Ayesha Zehri assumed her new responsibilities, after a notification was issued by the Services and General Administration regarding her appointment.
It was the first time in the administrative history of Balochistan that a female officer was appointed as deputy commissioner of any district in the province.
Ms Zehri, basically an electrical engineer, was working in the irrigation department. She did her BE in electrical engineering from Khuzdar Engineering University and joined as SDO in Wapda but in 2017 she appeared in provincial services commission exam and joined the provincial services.
During her stint as assistant commissioner of Chagai, Ms Zehri conducted many raids against criminals and drug smugglers in district and arrested a number of suspects after exchange of heavy fire.
She had also seized a huge amount of chemicals, being used in preparation of heroin, after an exchange of fire. However, when she went to the Levies station, they refused to take the custody of the chemical and registered a case in this regard. As she spoke to the press on the matter, a disciplinary action was taken against her and she was transferred and made OSD. She was later promoted and posted as deputy secretary (irrigation). During the rain emergency in Bolan, she helped the flood-stricken passengers stranded between Bibi Nani and Pinjra Bridge.

8,IHC sets aside ban on Imran’s live coverage,The media regulatory body had imposed a blanket ban on live coverage of Imran's speeches on August 20.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court issued a detailed order a petition of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, setting aside the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) ban on his live coverage.
The media regulatory body had imposed a blanket ban on live coverage of Mr Khan’s speeches on August 20, after he allegedly threatened Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Zeba Chaudhry, and the Islamabad Police IG and DIG, of ‘consequences’ after the judge handed over physical custody of the ex-PM’s aide, Shahbaz Gill, to police for two days.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah issued the detailed order on the petition filed by Mr Khan against the ban on his live coverage on electronic media.
Setting aside the Pemra notification, the IHC asked the media regulatory body to enforce its Code of Conduct in the light of Supreme Court’s judgement to ensure effective enforcement of its directions. The apex court had previously directed Pemra to devise a standard operating procedure for live coverage, in pursuant to which the electronic media had introduced a time-delay mechanism.
In his petition, the PTI chairman contended that under the Pemra Ordinance, one-third of the total members of the watchdog were supposed to constitute a quorum for the meetings requiring a decision by the authority, which comprised a chairman and 12 members.
Arguing before the court at a previous hearing, Mr Khan’s counsel Barrister Syed Ali Zafar pointed out that Pemra invoked sections 26 and 27 to impose a ban on live coverage of the PTI chairman. He said these sections could not be invoked to ban the speeches of a political leader since they empowered the regulator to ensure broadcast of suitable contents. Even otherwise, since Section 26 entailed penal consequences, the regulator was under an obligation to serve a prior notice to Mr Khan before banning his live coverage.
The IHC had disposed of the petition on Monday after hearing both sides.
