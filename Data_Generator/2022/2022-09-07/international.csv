0,EU says Russia burning excess gas after cutting supply,"Satellites registering leak of natural gas ""or them flaring the natural gas and this is very polluting,"" says EU energy chief.","JAKARTA/WASHINGTON: Russia is burning excess gas because it has no capacity to store it after cutting deliveries to the European Union, the bloc’s energy commissioner said on Tuesday.
“Our satellites are registering the leak of natural gas or them flaring the natural gas and this is very polluting,” European Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson told reporters during a visit to Indonesia.
“They don’t have alternative pipeline connections to other regions in the world, and their own underground gas storage is full.” 
Europe is facing an acute energy shortage this winter after the announcement on Friday of a complete shutdown of the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline by Russian giant Gazprom. The Kremlin has blamed the halt in deliveries on sanctions imposed by the West over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
Europe is also looking to wean itself off Russian oil, meaning Moscow  “is seeking new markets, and they are selling their oil products with a significant discount to the ones who are willing to buy it”, Simson said.
The G7 group of advanced nations on Friday announced a cap on the price of oil imported from Russia in order to limit Moscow’s revenues.
“We don’t want to pay the unfair price to the aggressor. So our message to Indonesia but also to India and China is, if you’re still willing to buy Russian oil products, propose an oil price cap to them,” Simson added.
Simson, who was in the Indonesian capital Jakarta for a G20 energy meeting and bilateral talks, will next fly to India where she is expected to discuss the price cap proposal. She did not indicate what position Indonesia had taken.
Indonesian oil company Pertamina previously considered snapping up Russian oil at a knockdown price but has not confirmed whether it has signed a contract since the start of the war in Ukraine in February.
N. Korean munitions for Ukraine
Russia is buying large amounts of  ammunition from North Korea to replenish stocks depleted by months of  intense fighting in Ukraine, a US official said on Tuesday.
Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb 24 with the apparent expectation of seizing control of the country within weeks. But  Ukraine has halted the advance with the help of weaponry and munitions  from the United States and other Nato and European allies.
“The  Russian Ministry of Defence is in the process of purchasing millions of  rockets and artillery shells from North Korea for use on the battlefield  in Ukraine,” a US official said in a statement.
“This purchase  indicates that the Russian military continues to suffer from severe  supply shortages in Ukraine, due in part to export controls and  sanctions,” the official said, on grounds of anonymity.
Both sides in the war have used huge amounts of artillery ammunition and lost large volumes of armor in the grinding battle. But  Western sanctions have made it harder for Moscow to acquire components  to manufacture replacements, including computer chips.
Under that  pressure, the US official said,  “We expect Russia could try to purchase  additional North Korean military equipment going forward.”

1,Gulf states warn Netflix over content that ‘contradicts’ Islam,Threaten legal action if content that “contradicts Islamic and societal values” is not removed.,"RIYADH: Saudi Arabia and neighbouring Gulf countries on Tuesday accused streaming giant Netflix of broadcasting content that “contradicts Islamic and societal values” and threatened legal action if it was not removed. 
A statement issued jointly by the Saudi media regulator and the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council, headquartered in Riyadh, did not specifically identify the offending content. “The platform was contacted to remove this content, including content directed to children,” the statement said. 
Regional authorities “will follow up on the platform’s compliance with the directives, and in the event that the infringing content continues to be broadcast, the necessary legal measures will be taken.”  
Gulf countries, including Saudi Arabia, have repeatedly locked horns with US film distributors over content related to sexual minorities, especially in films. 
Saudi Arabia, which only opened cinemas in 2017, asked Disney in April to cut “LGBTQ references” in the Marvel superhero film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Disney did not comply and the film ultimately was not screened in the country. 
The United Arab Emirates in June banned the Disney animated film Lightyear, which contains a lesbian kiss. 
But there was no immediate indication on Tuesday that GCC countries were objecting to LGBTQ content on Netflix. The UAE is considered one of the more liberal countries in the Gulf region, though films with adult content are routinely cut or edited.

2,Video shows Putin in tense encounter with military chief,Clip shows Putin and military chief sitting in a booth with wide space between them while maintaining uncomfortable silence.,"LONDON: Russian President Vladimir Putin was shown in an awkward encounter with his military chief of staff on Tuesday as he inspected war games in Russia’s Far East, thousands of miles from the war in Ukraine. 
The Zvezda military news service published video of Putin and chief of staff General Valery Gerasimov entering an observation booth, sitting down with a wide space between them and maintaining an uncomfortable silence while waiting for Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu to arrive. 
Gerasimov stroked his hair and shuffled papers and Putin picked up and peered through a pair of binoculars, at one point acknowledging a comment from the general by nodding tersely. 
The awkward body language drew scrutiny from political and military analysts on social media. 
“Putin obviously doesn’t even want to talk with the commander of the Russian armed forces,” wrote former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt on Twitter. 

 





 
In a separate clip, the mood appeared lighter as Putin and Shoigu were shown exchanging a joke while Gerasimov spoke on the phone. 
Gerasimov has been almost absent from public view during the 195 days of Russia’s war in Ukraine, prompting speculation about his standing with Putin and even at times about his health. 
Having captured about a fifth of the country, Russia has been fought to a virtual standstill while suffering heavy losses in troops and equipment. 
By proceeding with the four-yearly Vostok (East) war games, Putin appeared to be sending a signal that Russia’s military is able to conduct business as usual despite the demands of the war. 
But the defence ministry says the exercises that began on Sept 1 involve only 50,000 troops, a fraction of the 300,000 they said took part in 2018. Western military analysts say they believe both figures are exaggerated. 
The manoeuvres have included forces from both India and China, though it was not clear if Putin had seen troops from those countries in action. 
On Tuesday the defence ministry released video of the naval part of the exercise, showing Russia’s Pacific fleet practising launching Kalibr cruise missiles which it said had successfully struck a target more than 300 kilometres  away. 
On Monday, Russian and Chinese combat ships practised repelling an enemy air attack using air defence artillery systems. Last week warships from the two countries carried out anti-ship, anti-air and anti-submarine defence tasks in the Sea of Japan, the ministry said. 
Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping declared a “no limits” partnership in February, promising to collaborate more closely against the West. 
Russia is the biggest supplier of military hardware to India, which went ahead with the exercise days after the United States said it had concerns about any country holding such manoeuvres with Russia now. 
Moscow says the war games also involve military contingents and observers from Algeria, Laos, Mongolia, Nicaragua, Syria and six former Soviet republics.

3,UN urges Lanka to check ‘drift towards militarisation’,"“New government should immediately ... end the reliance on draconian security laws and crackdowns on peaceful protest,” says UN.","GENEVA: Sri Lanka must immediately reverse its  “drift towards militarisation” and prosecute those responsible for leading the country to its unprecedented economic crisis, the United Nations said on Tuesday.
The South Asian island nation has suffered acute food and fuel shortages, lengthy blackouts and spiralling inflation this year after running out of foreign currency to import essentials.
The crisis sparked months of protests against the government over economic mismanagement, culminating in a huge crowd storming the residence of the then-president Gotabaya Rajapaksa and chasing him from the country.
His successor Ranil Wickremesinghe has since taken a hard line against demonstrations, violently demolishing a protest camp in downtown Colombo and arresting leading activists.
“The new government should immediately reverse the drift towards militarisation, end the reliance on draconian security laws and crackdowns on peaceful protest,” the UN Human Rights Office said in its latest report on the country.
Sri Lanka defaulted on its $51 billion foreign debt in April and is in final negotiations for an International Monetary Fund bailout.

4,"Truss takes over as Britain’s prime minister, Johnson bows out","LONDON: Liz Truss took over as British prime minister on Tuesday, facing one of the most daunting set of challenges...","

Boris Johnson

 
LONDON: Liz Truss took over as British prime minister on Tuesday, facing one of the most daunting set of challenges for an incoming leader in post-War history led by soaring energy bills, a looming recession and industrial strife.
Truss, the fourth Conservative prime minister in six years, flew to the royal family’s Scottish home to be asked by Queen Elizabeth to form a government. She replaces Boris Johnson who was forced out after three tumultuous years in power.
“Ms Truss accepted Her Majesty’s offer and kissed hands upon her appointment as Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury,” Buckingham Palace said.
The 47-year-old former foreign secretary will later address the country from Downing Street before appointing her government. Johnson urged the country and his warring party to unite behind the new leader.
Truss inherits an economy in crisis, with inflation at double digits, the cost of energy soaring and the Bank of England warning of a lengthy recession by the end of this year. Already, workers across the economy have gone on strike.


Liz Truss

 
Her plan to revive growth through tax cuts while also potentially providing around 100 billion pounds ($116 billion) for energy has rattled financial markets, prompting investors to dump the pound and government bonds in recent weeks.
She also enters the latest crisis to buffet Britain with a weaker political hand than many of her predecessors.
Having held a place in the cabinet of senior ministers for eight years, she defeated rival Rishi Sunak in a vote of Conservative Party members by a tighter margin than expected, and more of the party’s lawmakers initially backed her rival.
Johnson, who tried to cling on to power in July despite ministers resigning en masse over a series of scandals, told reporters and politicians gathered in Downing Street early on Tuesday that the country must unite.
“This is it folks,” he said in his farewell speech.  “What I say to my fellow Conservatives, it’s time for politics to be over, folks. It’s time for us all to get behind Liz Truss and her team and her programme.”  
After speaking outside the famous black door, he left London to travel to northeast Scotland and tender his resignation to the 96-year-old queen before Truss followed him into Balmoral Castle.

5,Protests across Indonesia as anger mounts over fuel price increase,Protesters demand that govt reverses its first subsidised fuel price increase in eight years.,"JAKARTA: Thousands of people rallied in Indonesia’s biggest cities on Tuesday, demanding the government reverse its first subsidised fuel price increase in eight years amid soaring inflation.
Under pressure to control a ballooning energy subsidy budget, President Joko Widodo on Saturday said he had little choice but to cut the subsidy and let fuel prices rise by about 30pc in the country of 270 million people. Oil prices are about 32pc higher than a year ago.
Protests took place in and around the capital, Jakarta, and in the cities of Surabaya, Makassar, Kendari, Aceh, and Yogyakarta, among a series of demonstrations led by students and labour groups that police say could draw big crowds this week.
Thousands of police were deployed across Jakarta, many guarding petrol stations, fearing they could become targets of mounting anger over a price increase that unions say will hurt workers and the urban poor the most. “Workers are really, really suffering right now,” said Abdul Aris, a union official, vowing to keep fighting until the government gives way.
Small rallies took place at the weekend and on Monday, with tyres burned and some roads blocked as demonstrators vented their anger over the decision, which comes amid rising food costs and with the economy still reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Thousands gathered in Jakarta on Tuesday, marching and chanting slogans denouncing the government’s decision and calling for an increase in the minimum wage.
One demonstrator was seen shirtless with feet shackled to an empty petrol tank, carrying a sign highlighting the hardship brought by rising costs. Textile factory worker Adi Asmadi, 29, said his daily transport expenses would go up sharply.

6,One suspect in Canada stabbing spree dies; hunt on for brother,"Damien Sanderson’s mutilated body was ""located outdoors ... in proximity to a house that was being examined"", says police.","WELDON: A manhunt extended for a third day on Tuesday in the search for a suspect accused of multiple deadly stabbings in a remote Canadian Indigenous community and nearby town, with no motive yet known for the rampage.
The attack in the James Smith Cree Nation Indigenous community and the town of Weldon in Saskatchewan province on Sunday left 10 dead and 18 wounded.
An intense hunt across the vast Prairies region for two brothers believed responsible — Myles and Damien Sanderson, aged 30 and 31 respectively — narrowed after the older sibling was found dead on Monday.
Damien Sanderson’s mutilated body was  “located outdoors in a heavily grassed area in proximity to a house that was being examined” in the James Smith Cree Nation, police assistant commissioner Rhonda Blackmore told a news conference late Monday.
The younger Sanderson — who is also wanted for breaching parole in May after serving part of a sentence for assault and robbery — is suspected of having killed his brother, she said. 
He remains at large and is considered armed and dangerous. “He may be injured and seek medical attention,” Blackmore added. According to Evan Bray, police chief of the provincial capital Regina, Myles Sanderson could be hiding out in the city — 300 kilometres from the site of the attack — after fleeing in a vehicle.
Authorities across Saskatchewan and two neighboring provinces, along with Canada-US border officials remain on high alert for the suspect, who has a history of explosive violence that led to nearly 60 past criminal convictions.
Residents hide indoors 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the attacks shocking and heartbreaking, while lamenting that  “tragedies like these have become all too commonplace.” Since 2017, Canada has witnessed a gunman masquerading as a policeman kill 22 people in Nova Scotia, another kill six worshippers at a Quebec City mosque, and a driver of a van kill 11 pedestrians in Toronto.
In the James Smith Cree Nation and nearby Weldon, residents described overwhelming grief and fear.
“Both communities are destroyed. All lives are shattered,” Ruby Works told public broadcaster CBC. She named her friend and Weldon neighbor Wes Petterson, a 77-year-old widower, as among those killed.
“If someone needed a hand, he helped. He was a kind-hearted man,” Works said.  “He didn’t deserve this.” Residents of the small town are terrified, she added, many staying locked indoors. The James Smith Cree Nation has asked for privacy as they mourn.

7,Palestinian killed in Israeli raid in Jenin,"16 others wounded after Israeli troops enter Jenin to carry out a home demolition, says Palestinian health ministry.","JENIN: A Palestinian was killed and 16 wounded on Tuesday when Israeli troops entered Jenin in the occupied West Bank to carry out a home demolition, the Palestinian health ministry said.
“The outcome of the Israeli aggression on Jenin at dawn today: a 29-year-old martyr and 16 wounded with bullets and shrapnel were admitted to hospitals,” the ministry said.
Palestinian official news agency Wafa identified the dead man as Mohammed Musa Mohammed Sabaaneh, 29. Sabaaneh’s father, Musa Sabaaneh said that a soldier  “inside a jeep fired a bullet” at his son.
“We were asleep and did not know the news. We received a call that my son was seriously injured,” he said.
Thousands of mourners gathered in Jenin as Sabaaneh’s body was paraded through the streets at his funeral. Laid alongside his body was an assault rifle emblazoned with the emblem of Saraya al-Quds, the armed wing of Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad.
The Israeli army said it entered Jenin overnight  “in order to demolish the residence” of the perpetrator of a deadly shooting attack in Tel Aviv in April.
“During the activity, a violent riot was instigated. The rioters burned tyres, hurled rocks, Molotov cocktails and explosive devices at the forces, who responded with riot dispersal means,” it added.
“Hits were identified.” Raad Hazem killed three Israelis in a shooting spree in Tel Aviv’s busy Dizengoff Street nightlife district on April 7, before being shot dead after a massive manhunt. His father Fathi Hazem and brother Hamam are both wanted by Israel.

8,27 killed as Al Qaeda launches attack on Yemen separatists,"Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula attacks positions held by UAE-trained Security Belt group in Abyan province, say sources.","ADEN: Twenty-one separatist fighters and six members of Al Qaeda’s Yemen branch were killed on Tuesday as an attack by the jihadists punctured months of relative peace in the war-torn country, government and security sources said.
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) attacked positions held by the UAE-trained Security Belt group in Abyan province in Yemen’s south, the sources said.
The violence came just days after the jihadist group released a video of a United Nations worker whom it abducted in the same province more than six months ago.
About three hours of fighting  “left 21 dead among the (Security Belt), including an officer, and six among the Al Qaeda combatants”, a government official said on condition of anonymity. Two security sources confirmed the death toll.
Yemen has been gripped by conflict since Iran-backed Houthi rebels took control of the capital Sanaa in 2014, triggering a Saudi-led military intervention in support of the beleaguered government the following year.
AQAP and militants loyal to the militant Islamic State group have thrived in the chaos.
The Security Belt, a powerful southern Yemen separatist force, has played a decisive role in the fight against the jihadists, forcing them to retreat from towns into rural areas.
Tuesday’s fighting comes as the Houthis and forces supporting the ousted government observe a shaky ceasefire in the years-long civil war.
Riven by divisions, the groups opposing the Houthis, who originate from the north, include southern separatists who support the re-establishment of South Yemen.
The country was divided into North and South Yemen until reunification in 1990.
Kidnapped UN worker
Underlining Yemen’s parlous security, on Saturday AQAP released a video showing a United Nations worker who was abducted more than six months ago, the SITE Intelligence Group reported.
Five UN staff members were kidnapped in Abyan in February while returning to the port city of Aden after a field mission, UN spokesperson Eri Kaneko said at the time.
In Saturday’s video message, apparently recorded on Aug 9, Akam Sofyol Anam urges  “the UN, the international community, the humanitarian organisations, to please come forward... and meet the demands of my captors”, without outlining the demands.
Formed in a merger of Al Qaeda’s Yemen and Saudi branches, AQAP has carried out attacks on both rebel and government targets in Yemen as well as foreigners.
It has been accused of plotting attacks beyond the Middle East and its leaders have been targeted by a US drone war for more than two decades, although the number of strikes has dropped off in recent years.
Yemen’s UN-brokered ceasefire has drastically reduced fighting since the truce began in April, but outbreaks of violence continue.

9,Dream job: a Japanese man gets paid to do nothing,"Shoji Morimoto charges 10,000 yen per booking to accompany clients and simply exist as a companion.","TOKYO: Shoji Morimoto has what some would see as a dream job: he gets paid to do pretty much nothing.
The 38-year-old Tokyo resident charges 10,000 yen ($71) per booking to accompany clients and simply exist as a companion.
“Basically, I rent myself out. My job is to be wherever my clients want me to be and to do nothing in particular,” Morimoto said, adding that he had handled some 4,000 sessions in the past four years.
With a lanky build and average looks, Morimoto now boasts nearly a quarter of a million followers on Twitter, where he finds most of his clients. Roughly a quarter of them are repeat customers, including one who has hired him 270 times.
His job has taken him to a park with a person who wanted to play on a see-saw. He has also beamed and waved through a train window at a complete stranger who wanted a send-off.
Doing nothing doesn’t mean Morimoto will do anything. He has turned down offers to move a fridge and go to Cambodia, and doesn’t take any requests of a sexual nature.
Last week, Morimoto sat opposite Aruna Chida, a 27-year-old data analyst clad in a sari, having a sparse conversation over tea and cakes.
Chida wanted to wear the Indian garment out in public but was worried it might embarrass her friends. So she turned to Morimoto for companionship.
“With my friends I feel I have to entertain them, but with the rental-guy (Morimoto) I don’t feel the need to be chatty,” she said.
Before Morimoto found his true calling, he worked at a publishing company and was often chided for  “doing nothing”.
“I started wondering what would happen if I provided my ability to ‘do nothing’ as a service to clients,” he said.
The companionship business is now Morimoto’s sole source of income, with which he supports his wife and child. Although he declined to disclose how much he makes, he said he sees about one or two clients a day. Before the pandemic, it was three or four a day.
As he spent a Wednesday doing nothing of note in Tokyo, Morimoto reflected on the bizarre nature of his job and appeared to question a society that values productivity and derides uselessness.
“People tend to think that my ‘doing nothing’ is valuable because it is useful (for others) ... But it’s fine to really not do anything. People do not have to be useful in any specific way,” he said.
