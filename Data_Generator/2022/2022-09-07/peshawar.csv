1,Tribal policemen to boycott training,KHYBER: Policemen from five tribal districts have decided to boycott the ongoing training as they say it is designed...,"KHYBER: Policemen from five tribal districts have decided to boycott the ongoing training as they say it is designed for constable level officials.
The decision was made in an emergency meeting of policemen from Khyber, Bajaur, Momand, Orakzai and South Waziristan tribal districts. The meeting, held at Police Training Centre at Shahkas in Jamrud, was presided over by Said Jalal, the chairman of the action committee of the tribal police.
The participants of the meeting alleged that the government did not fulfil the commitments made with them at the time of their conversion from Khasadar Force to police.
Mazhar Afridi, a spokesman for the tribal police committee, told Dawn after the meeting that most of the former khasadars had agreed to their conversion to police on the condition that no outsiders, except DPO, would be transferred to any other merged district. 
He said that they were also promised that they would be absorbed in the police force in accordance with their ranks in the previous Khasadar Force.
He, however, regretted that provincial government backtracked on their promises and were forcing them to undergo the training, which was designed for constable rank policemen.
“The government is using different tactics to deprive us of our legitimate rights and deny us the promised privileges. It is not acceptable to us as we demand training in accordance with our rank and seniority,” he said.
Hikmat Afridi, another senior police official, questioned the rationale behind imparting physical training to senior officials whereas the same was designed for constables.
“We will not agree to the current training pattern at any cost as we have been deceived several times in fulfilment of the pledges made to us during our initial conversion to police force,” he said.
He demanded of the chief minister and police chief to uphold their commitments as majority of the tribal police were feeling deprived of their rights.
PROTEST: Customs clearing agents held a protest demonstration at Torkham on Tuesday against the imposition of regulatory duty (RD) on the import of fresh fruits from Afghanistan.
Terming the new duty a cruel step by Federal Board of Revenue, they said that it would cause losses to them while the prices of imported fruits would also increase in the local market.

4,KP govt needs Rs4 billion to reconstruct flood-hit health facilities,Health dept to make appeal to UN agencies and international donors.,"PESHAWAR: The health department will launch an appeal of Rs4 billion for construction of hospitals damaged by the recent floods in the province, according to officials.
They said that authorities were busy to wipe out standing water from the hospitals and make them functional in the affected areas.
“The department will make an appeal to the UN agencies and international donor organisations for rebuilding of the health outlets damaged by the recent spell of incessant rains and subsequent floods,” said officials.
They said that the rains and floods caused severe damage to the health facilities, which needed to be rebuilt as soon as possible so that the people could start getting services in the flood-stricken areas.

Health dept to make appeal to UN agencies and international donors

As per report, the flood fully damaged 53 health facilities including 16 civil dispensaries (CDs), 33 basic health units (BHUs) and four rural health centres (RHCs), mostly in Tank, Dera Ismail Khan, Karak and Kohistan Lower and couple of facilities in Swat, Dir, North and South Waziristan.
“The government will require an estimated Rs4 billion to rebuild these outlets so that the patients continue getting services. The department would continue to hold medical camps in the areas where staff is available,” said officials.
They said that a meeting was convened by Health Secretary Amer Sultan Tareen on Wednesday (today) to take stock of the situation and present a consolidated report to the government. In addition to the fully damaged buildings, rainwater also caused partial damage to more than 190 health facilities in some districts.
There are 2,651 public health facilities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa including teaching hospitals, Category A, B and C hospitals, BHUs, RHCs, CDs, mother and child health centres, civil hospitals, sub-health centres, community health centres and leprosy centres where patients receive free services as well as medicines.
However, the week-long rains and floods played havoc with the health facilities in about 19 districts where the department continued to hold free medical camps to cope with the food and water-borne diseases triggered by rains.
The health department has so far provided treatment to more than 180,000 patients including 30 per cent people suffering from acute watery diarrhoea and 25 per cent from skin-related infections.
Officials said that in the first week of the calamity, the department held 110 medical camps, the number of which was then reduced to 30 because the health facilities became operational and the doctors, paramedics, nurses and support staff returned to work.
“The department is still working in collaboration with line departments, such as water and sanitation, public health engineering and tehsil municipal administration to clear standing water from the health facilities and patients start getting services as usual,” they said.
Health department is still engaged in chlorination of water and scaling up public awareness regarding prevention of the diseases caused by contamination of water as the people risk diseases even after stoppage of floods.
“Vaccination has also been started to safeguard children against vaccine-preventable childhood ailments throughout the province with special focus on the flood-hit districts,” said officials. Similarly, they said, people risked dengue fever because of the stagnant water pools left by the floods were the potential breeding sites of mosquitoes, the main source of the dengue fever.
They said that the department was also in contact with Provincial Disaster Management Authority to send essential medical supplies to the far off areas through helicopters and other mode of transportation.
They said that deputy commissioners in all the districts were leading the relief activities with regard to prevention of the disease, the outbreaks of which was feared in the aftermath of floods.

6,Court orders suspension of Peshawar SHO over ‘illegal detention’,"Asks IGP to hold inquiry, submit report in 15 days.","PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has ordered the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa inspector general of police (IGP) to suspend a Peshawar station house officer (SHO) and hold an inquiry into the allegation of illegally detaining a citizen for two weeks and handing him over to the Punjab police.
A bench consisting of Justice Roohul Amin Khan and Justice Shahid Khan directed the IGP to inform the court’s additional registrar (judicial) about the action taken by him on the matter within a fortnight.
It issued the order while disposing of a habeas corpus petition filed by detainee Sohail Khan’s father, Badam Khan, a resident of Badhaber area here, observing that it was clear that the man was in the custody of Punjab police in a criminal case registered in Gujranwala district.
The bench directed the IGP to conduct the inquiry through an honest and impartial police officer for “digging out the actual facts and deal with the delinquent SHO under the law.”

Asks IGP to hold inquiry, submit report in 15 days

It observed that the police while conducting inquiry against the SHO of the Badhaber police station should adhere to the Government Servants (Efficiency and Disciplinary) Rules, 2011, whose Section 6 provided that the official under inquiry should be suspended for enabling the inquiry officer to render his fair and impartial report.
Advocate Safdar Iqbal Khattak appeared for the petitioner and said Sohail Khan was arrested by SHO of the Badhaber police station Ijaz Nabi on Aug 15 in presence of other villagers.
He said the petitioner along with some local elders approached the SHO to know about the whereabouts of his son but the SHO expressed complete ignorance about it leading to the filing of the petition.
The SHO appeared before the bench on Aug 30 and was ordered to produce the detainee the next day. The SHO turned up on Aug 31 but sought more time to follow the order. The court adjourned the hearing until Sept 1.
On the next hearing, the SHO along with the DSP (legal) Mohammad Asif appeared before the bench and produced a report declaring that neither the SHO of the Badhaber police station nor officials of other police stations had arrested the petitioner’s son.
The report declared that the detainee was wanted by the police in two criminal cases registered at the same police station on Aug 5, 2022, and Aug 8, 2022.
The petitioner’s counsel said as per information of the petitioner, the detainee was in illegal custody of the SHO from Aug 15 to Aug 31 at 4pm, where after he was shifted to Punjab and was implicated in a narcotics case registered at a police station in Gujranwala on Sept 1.
The bench observed that the SHO’s Aug 30 and 31 statements that he would produce the detainee coupled with registration of a narcotics case against the detainee on Sept 1 in Punjab required through probe.
It added that the police were responsible for maintaining public order and safety of people with a mandate to prevent crime in the community.
“The police officials of this province have achieved the title and position of exemplary police by securing the positive image of public in the society, however, the unwarranted or excessive and often illegal use of force by an individual police officer against civilians will not only being a bad name to the police department, but also cause damage to the fabric of entire justice sector,” it observed.
The court declared that the role of the SHO in the case showed his highhandedness through illegal confinement of a person despite the fact that he was allegedly charged in two different cases of same police station.
It added that it, without dilating on the conduct and attitude of the SHO towards public and court, wanted the IGP to probe the matter by an honest and impartial officer.

7,Destruction of roads leaves Swat farmers in lurch,Growers say they are unable to transport vegetables and fruits to market...,"SWAT: The recent floods have not only wreaked havoc on the infrastructure in the upper region of Swat but also washed away hundreds of acres of agricultural lands in the valley.
The upper region of Swat, especially Bahrain tehsil, is not only famous for natural beauty but also known for its off-season vegetables. The region including Madyan, Bahrain, Mankiyal, Pishmal, Aryana, Kalam, Utror, Gabral, Ushu, Matiltan and other areas have great potential for vegetable cultivation.
The region produces good quality tomatoes, French beans, cucumbers, peas, cabbages, cauliflowers, turnips, radishes, carrots, spinach, coriander, broccoli, bottle gourd and potatoes. It is also famous for high value walnuts, apples and pears.
After the flash floods, farmers in Bahrain tehsil suffered huge losses as most of the crops and fruits like cabbages, potatoes and apples were not only washed away but owing to destruction of roads from Bahrain to Kalam, they could not transport their vegetables to the markets in Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Islamabad and other cities.

Growers say they are unable to transport vegetables and fruits to market

“My potatoes and cabbages are ready but I cannot take them to the lower parts of the country due to destruction of roads. However, I have to pick a little number of cabbages and potatoes and carry them on my shoulder from Aryana area to Bahrain where I sell them and buy food items for my family,” said Hazrat Faqir.
He said that one day he walked all over from Aryana to Bahrain bazaar and returned home after spending a night and buying food items for his family.
Bakth Munir, another farmer of Kalam, said that walking and climbing mountains with a heavy load was not an easy job. “We walk about 30 kilometres with a heavy load on our shoulders. We cannot return home the same day due to tiredness and pain in our feet so we spend a night in Bahrain and then come back,” he said.
He said that a major part of his vegetables would go waste and perish as he could carry only a little quantity.
According to Iftikhar Ahmad, the director of agriculture, Bahrain tehsil was producing thousands of tonnes of vegetables and fruits. “Vegetables are grown on 3,903 hectares of land in Bahrain tehsil where the floods washed away 370 hectares land incurring Rs303 millions of losses on farmers. Orchards cover 1,837 hectares of land where the floods damaged about 12.5 hectares land causing Rs18.52 million losses,” he told Dawn.
He said that the farmers would receive huge losses if the road from Bahrain to Kalam was not restored in time. “The road from Bahrain to Kalam has been washed away at 13 places while seven bridges have also been swept away due to which the ready crops cannot be transported and if the road is not be restored within few days, the crops will perish in the fields,” he added.
The farmers demanded of the government to accelerate work on the restoration of roads so that they could transport the ready crops to market avoid heavy losses.

10,PHC issues notices over delay in Peshawar housing project,Allottees complain land not acquired in last three years...,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has directed the Pakistan Housing Authority Foundation (PHAF) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Housing Authority (KPPHA) to respond to a petition against a delay in land acquisition for and start of development work on the PHA Residencia Peshawar housing scheme.
A bench consisting of Justice Lal Jan Khattak and Justice Ijaz Anwar issued notices for the purpose after holding a preliminary hearing of the petition filed by 72 of the allottees including Ahmad Khalil and others requesting the court to declare that the respondents, including PHAF and KPPHA, had committed the offence of cheating public at large by receiving millions of rupees from the petitioners for the much-publicised housing project but failing to get the land’s possession and start developmental work on it.
The petitioners sought the court’s orders for the respondents to hand over the land or houses to the petitioners without further delay.
They also requested the court to ask respondents to intimate them about progress on the project saying no progress had been seen on the project site during the last three years though they’d made down payments and paid installments.

Allottees complain land not acquired in last three years

The respondents in the petition are the federal housing and works secretary, KP government through the housing secretary, PHAF chief executive officer and director (land and estate), and KPPHA director-general.
Counsel for the petitioners Rahat Ali Khan Nahaqi said the project, PHA Residencia Peshawar, was initiated in 2019 with the promise to give possession of the grey structure of houses to petitioners and other allottees, who mostly belonged to low-income groups, within three years.
He, however, said the failure to acquire land showed the disinterest of the respondents in the project.
The lawyer said the PHAF, an implementing arm of the ministry of housing and works, had been tasked with shouldering responsibility in line with the vision of the then prime minister, Imran Khan, of constructing five million houses for low-income groups.
He said the PHA Residencia Peshawar would consist of grey-structure and finished apartments.
Mr Nahaqi said the project was undertaken as a joint venture by the PHAF and KPPHA, which signed a memorandum of understanding on Dec 11, 2019, and decided to launch the scheme in Surizai area of Peshawar.
He contended that the scheme was launched with much fanfare amid promise about the provision of low-cost houses to the allottees.
The lawyer said special quotas were reserved for government employees and private people along with different categories.
He said draws were held for the project declaring his clients and many others successful and there followed down payments required for different categories.
Mr Nahaqi, however, said even three years later, the project wasn’t executed.
