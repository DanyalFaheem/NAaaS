0,Rupee’s fall continues despite IMF tranche,Rate gap between interbank and open market widens...,"KARACHI: The rupee failed to resist the mounting pressure of the US dollar and witnessed a further loss of Rs1.56 in the interbank market on Tuesday.
It may be surprising for many who were waiting to see a dollar depreciation after an inflow of over $1 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but currency experts said the shortage of greenbacks is the reason behind a weak rupee.
Earlier, the market was expecting that the resumption of the IMF loan would open windows for credit inflows from many sources, but the situation is disappointing. The foreign exchange reserves of the country have been declining since the debt servicing is continuous. The government is required to arrange $35 billion for the entire fiscal year (FY23).
Speaking to Dawn, currency experts said the market is keenly watching the situation and its response is clearly indicative. The calculations show that despite over $31bn in inflows of remittances, the country will need $35bn since the import gap will require more than remittances while the current account deficit demands more dollars to fill the hole in the external account.

Rate gap between interbank and open market widens

There are also reports in the media that Qatar has refused to keep $3bn in accounts of the State Bank of Pakistan. However, there is no official confirmation of this report.
The government is willing to arrange dollars from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
Finance Minister Miftah Ismail is planning to ask the World Bank and Asian Development Bank to help the country with flood damage. The initial assessment is that th e country has lost $10 to $12.5 billion in the flood across the country.
The dollar was up by Rs1.56 to close at Rs221.42 in the interbank market. After hitting a low of Rs213.90 on Aug 16, the greenback has gained Rs7.52 against the local currency.
The dollar is trading at Rs233 on the open market, up Rs3 from the previous day. The open market value of the dollar has increased by Rs23 since Aug 1.
The open market has been short of foreign currencies for the last three weeks, which has resulted in dollar shortages.
Currency dealers in the open market said the inflow of foreign currencies is at its lowest. They blamed the government’s decision for this crisis. 
The government has made it compulsory to declare cash and other valuables even at arrivals. Now the Pakistanis, who are not satisfied with this condition, are avoiding bringing foreign currencies. The dealers said there is no selling in the open market, no export of these currencies and no import of dollars against these currencies.
Currency dealers further said that the grey market has appeared to buy dollars and other currencies at higher rates, which is the reason for the increasing gap in the greenback rates between the open and banking markets.

Headline inflation clocked in at 27.3 per cent last week, a 47-year high. Prices of food items are expected to increase in the wake of the floods that have substantially damaged crops nationwide.
Arif Habib Ltd said the benchmark KSE-100 index, after opening in the positive zone, succumbed to pressure as investors’ participation remained sideways. Another reason for the drop in share prices was the continuous rupee devaluation against dollar.
The local currency depreciated 0.7 per cent against the dollar to close at 221.42 in the interbank market. JS Global said it expected range-bound activity to continue in the next few sessions. It recommended that investors should avail any downside as an opportunity to buy cement and textile stocks.

2,Oil falls as demand fears overtake Opec-led rally,Stronger US dollar also puts pressure on oil prices.,"NEW YORK: Oil prices sank on Tuesday after a two-day rally as concern returned about weaker demand and the prospect of more interest rate hikes trumped support from Opec+’s first output target cut since 2020.
Brent crude was down $3.26, or 3.4 per cent, to $92.48 at 11:27 a.m. EDT (1527 GMT). US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell from Monday’s trading to $86.37, down 50 cents or 0.6pc from Friday’s close.
Technical factors, including that the U.S. benchmark has been trading since Sunday without settlement due to the Labor Day holiday, helped support WTI over Brent. WTI still held close to multi-month lows.
Extended Covid-19 lockdowns in Chengdu, China, have added to worries that high inflation and interest rate hikes will hit demand. The European Central Bank is widely expected to lift rates sharply when it meets on Thursday.
“The Opec+ news is now in the market and the focus has temporarily shifted to economic and inflationary concerns amongst which the two relevant factors are the extended Covid lockdowns in China and Thursday’s ECB rate decision,” said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM.
“Undoubtedly, they raise fears of demand destruction.”
A stronger US dollar, which was up about 0.6pc on better-than-expected Amer­ican services industry data, also put pressure on oil prices.
The reading on services sector activity fed into expectations that the US Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, which could trigger a recession and bring down fuel demand.
On the supply side, signs that an agreement to resurrect Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers was less imminent challenged limited crude prices by reducing the odds that Opec+ would move forward with its output reduction plan, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.

3,AIIB keen to fund Wapda hydro projects,"Wapda asks Beijing-based bank to finance 1,500MW Thakot-3 and 2,400MW Pattan projects.","LAHORE: After the  interest shown by the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank  (AIIB) in hydropower projects in Pakistan, the Water and  Power Development Authority (Wapda) has asked the bank to finance the  1,500MW Thakot-3 and 2,400MW Pattan projects—the mega hydel power  schemes of the Indus Cascades. 
The authority has also offered the bank  to finance the power generation portion of the 4,500MW Diamer-Bhasha  Dam, Dawn has learnt.
“The AIIB has already financed the construction of Tarbela 5th extension project by approving a soft loan  of $300 million. The WB has also financed this scheme by approving a $390m  loan. And now they (the AIIB), keeping in view the intensity of recent  floods and wastage of huge water worth billions of dollars and the  country’s less storage capacity, have visited us and expressed interest  to finance our projects,” a senior Wapda official explained while  talking to Dawn on Tuesday.
“In a meeting with the senior  AIIB official at Wapda House on Tuesday, we also offered them Thakot-3  and Pattan projects to finance. We asked to also look into financing the  Diamer-Bhasha Dam’s power generation portion,” the official who was  privy to the meeting added.
It may be mentioned that the business  development mission of the AIIB, headed by its Director General  (Investments) Supee Teravaninthorn, called on Wapda Chairman retired Lt  Gen Sajjad Ghani on Tuesday. The matters related to the financing of Wapda  projects were discussed during the meeting.
Speaking on the  occasion, the Wapda chief thanked the AIIB for the financial support for the under-construction 1,530MW Tarbela 5th Extension Hydropower Project.
Dilating upon the significance of the hydel electricity, he said, Wapda’s emphasis was on producing green energy.
“We intend to replace 9,000MW electricity being generated on costly fossil fuel with clean and low-cost hydel energy.
Since  the Diamer-Bhasha Dam is planned to generate 4,500MW, hence, it alone  will drastically cut the electricity generation through fossil fuel in  Pakistan,” he said.
He said the AIIB could help Wapda for the  purpose and participate in the power generation component of the Diamer Basha  Dam project, he added. The chairman further said flood is a recurring  phenomenon in Pakistan. Therefore, it is essentially needed to construct  two or three mega water reservoirs in the country to mitigate floods and  avoid further losses. “AIIB can also help Pakistan in the construction of  dams,” he added.
AIIB Development Mission, on this occasion,  showed keen interest in financing Wapda projects. “the AIIB and Wapda  will remain closely associated and look into the possibilities of  financial assistance for Wapda projects. Earlier, Wapda Member (Finance)  briefed the Mission about investment prospects in under-construction as  well as future projects of Wapda.
Meanwhile, AFD Energy Mission  also had a meeting with chairman Wapda to finalise the loan agreement  for Keyal Khwar Hydropower Project. The issues related to Warsak project  were also discussed in the meeting.

5,Pak Suzuki extends plant shutdown,Continued shortage of completely knocked down kits forces company to extend plant shutdown from Sept 12-16.,"KARACHI: Continued shortage of completely knocked down (CKD) kits has forced Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (PSMCL) to extend the plant shutdown from Sept 12-16.
Further in lieu of periodic maintenance, the plant would also be closed from Sept 19-23, PSMCL said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.
On Sept 2, the company had planned non-production days (NPDs) during Sept 8-9.

6,Half of Asia-Pacific workforce surviving on $5.5 per day,Pakistan among 15 countries where women are more likely to have an informal job.,"ISLAMABAD:  Half of the Asia-Pacific region’s workforce is poor or on the verge of  poverty, surviving on $5.5 per day, according to a report released by  the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the  Pacific (UNESCAP).
The UNESCAP report said that with more than  half the region’s population excluded from any social protection, the  workforce is highly vulnerable to systematic shocks such as pandemics or  economic downturns.
The region’s workforce is insufficiently  productive, healthy, and protected, although progress has been made  since 2015, the report adds. The main reason is that two in three  workers are employed informally. That is 1.4 billion workers, 600  million of whom are found in the agricultural sector, according to the  “2022 Social Outlook for Asia and the Pacific: The Workforce We Need”.
It lacks adequate education and specialised skills needed to access opportunities emanating from global megatrends or overcome related challenges. Vulnerability undermines labour productivity, which has fallen below the global average. Sustainable livelihoods remain out of reach for many, particularly women and young people in rural areas, the report says.

Pakistan among 15 countries where women are more likely to have an informal job

Over half of employed women are in informal jobs in  16 out of 27 countries. Relative to men, women are also more likely to have an informal job in 15 countries. This gap is particularly high in Turkey, the Marshall Islands, Nepal, and Pakistan.
The absence of affordable health care is detrimental to the workforce’s health, productivity, and future economic output. In Asia and the  Pacific, people in low and lower-middle-income countries can expect to  die 13 years earlier than people in high-income countries, and child  mortality rates are 10 times higher. The poor health of children in low  and lower-middle-income countries is compounded by low investments in  health care and education services.
This undermines the chances of  the future workforce to find a decent job. It also hampers future tax  revenues and economic output. Only a few countries in Asia and the  Pacific have come close to Universal Health Coverage (UHC), and  catastrophic out-of-pocket health spending threatens to push more people  in our region into poverty than anywhere else. The inaccessibility of affordable health care increases sickness absenteeism and exacerbates  poverty. It reduces the productivity of the workforce across the region.
Underinvestment in social protection and high labour-market informality mean  illness and unemployment, pregnancy and old age, disability and injury,  continue to push workers into poverty. The Covid-19 pandemic has  provided evidence of the consequence of the lack of social protection.  Eighty-five million unprotected people have been pushed into extreme  poverty, living on less than $1.9 per day, and a further 158 million  into moderate poverty, living on $3.2 a day.
Climate change,  population ageing, and digitalisation are megatrends that could create  opportunities for some workers and exacerbate the vulnerability of  others.

7,"Global supplies sufficient to offset rice crop losses in Pakistan, China",Pakistan is forecast to have lost around 10 per cent of its 2022 estimated rice production of around 8.7m tonnes.,"SINGAPORE: Abundant rice supplies in key exporters may largely offset an expected drop in output after floods in Pakistan and severe heatwave in China damaged crops, capping any gains in prices from steady Asian demand.
Pakistan, the world’s fourth-largest rice exporter, suffered extensive damage to agriculture, including rice, as floods ravaged large swathes of its farmland, while extremely high temperatures in parts of China at the end of August have taken a toll on rice output in the world’s biggest importer of the staple.
However, global rice stockpiles are pretty comfortable and an improving Indian crop outlook should quell any supply concerns and limit any price increases from recent strong demand that has emerged from Bangladesh, said a Singapore-based trader at one of the world’s top rice trading companies.
Pakistan is forecast to have lost around 10 per cent of its 2022 estimated rice production of around 8.7 million tonnes, while China has suffered some damage, although the extent of crop losses is not clear, traders said.
Food prices have soared in markets across Pakistan as devastating rains ruin crops and disrupt supplies, an early sign of how the worst floods in decades are creating food shortages at a time of financial crisis.
“Pakistan’s rice output has been really good over recent seasons,” Peter Clubb, a market analyst at the International Grains Council said.  “While any large production loss is obviously bad, that improvement in production over recent seasons gives a bit of leeway.”
China’s Agriculture Minister Tang Renjian expressed concern that high temperatures and drought have hit rice production in the eastern provinces of Jiangsu and Anhui.
“It is too early to say exactly how poor yields (in China) may be,” Clubb said.  “A general point, stocks in China are still very ample.”
Monsoon rains, which were delayed in parts of India’s northern and eastern rice producing regions, have improved over the last couple of weeks, boosting crop prospects in the world’s largest rice supplier, traders said.
India had earlier been examining a need to restrict exports of 100pc broken rice mainly used for feed purposes.
But an improvement in rainfall over Indian rice growing areas has ended any discussion of government restrictions on exports, said a second trader in Singapore who sells Indian rice to buyers in Asia and Africa.
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation’s world price index fell for a fifth month in August, after hitting a record in March after Russia invaded Ukraine, as a resumption of grain exports from Ukrainian ports contributed to improved supply prospects.
However, strong demand from Bangladesh has underpinned rice prices in recent weeks.
Bangladesh plans to import around 1.2 million tonnes of rice over the next few months to shore up reserves and cool high domestic prices.
A senior Bangladeshi food ministry official said the country is buying 530,000 tonnes of rice from India, Vietnam and Myanmar under government-to-government deals and is in talks with major producers India, Vietnam and Thailand.
