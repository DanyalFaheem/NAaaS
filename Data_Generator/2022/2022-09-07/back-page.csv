0,PM orders steps to avert Swat-like destruction,Directs authorities to ensure zoning regulations across country to avoid illegal construction on riverbeds.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet increased the size of cash assistance to flood victims from Rs28 billion to Rs70bn on Tuesday and stressed the need for strict adherence to zoning regulations all over the country to avoid illegal construction on the river bed to avert Swat-like destruction caused by flash floods.
Presiding over the cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged the nation to exhibit a spirit of sacrifice and resilience like the one observed on Sept 6, 1965 (Defence Day) to cope with the current grave challenges in the wake of floods.
“The federal cabinet today [Tuesday] decided to increase the cash assistance from Rs28bn to Rs70bn as a one-time payment at the rate of Rs25,000 per family,” the prime minister said in a Twitter post after the cabinet meeting. “This increase was made keeping in view the scale and extent of flood damage. The money is being distributed through BISP [Benazir Income Support Programme].”

 





 
In another tweet, he said that as the country grappled with “historic floods” and other challenges, “we need to summon the spirit of 1965”.

Cabinet told most deaths recorded in Sindh, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa

“National unity is our greatest strength. Anyone intending to hurt the bond between our armed forces and people is not a friend of Pakistan. Let us fortify this bond of one nation,” he said.

 





 
Flooding, brought by record monsoon rainfall and glacier melt in the north, has impacted 33 million people and killed at least 1,325, including 466 children, according to the National Disaster Management Authority.
According to Prime Minister House, Mr Sharif also directed the authorities concerned to ensure zoning regulations for utilising the river bed were effectively enforced to prevent flood-related destruction took place in Swat from happening again.
The cabinet meeting also offered fateha for martyrs of the armed forces as well as the citizens who lost their lives to flash floods.

The rains have also damaged 1.68m houses, 246 bridges, 5,735 kilometres of road and washed away 750,000 livestock heads.
The cabinet meeting was informed that almost 80pc to 90pc of land would be made cultivable for the wheat crop, which otherwise could risk a severe food crisis. It was told that of the Rs28bn previously allocated for flood-hit people, Rs20bn had already been disbursed while the remainder would reach the entitled families within the next three days.
Besides, the prime minister has also announced Rs15bn for Sindh, Rs10bn each for Balochistan and KP, and Rs3bn for GB for the affected citizens. The federal government has also provided Rs1m each for families who have lost their loved ones to floods.
Railways Minister Khawaja Saad Rafiq told the meeting floods had damaged four railway lines and the traffic on the Quetta-Sibbi section was suspended due to a damaged railway bridge.
Energy Minister Engineer Khurram Dastgir said two of the three 810-megawatt power transmission lines of Balochistan had been restored and only submerged grid stations were closed at present.

1,WHO warns of worsening situation in Pakistan,"Have received reports of increased number of cases of acute watery diarrhoea, typhoid, measles and malaria, says WHO spokesman.","ISLAMABAD / WASHINGTON: Amid the World Health Organi­sation’s (WHO) warning that the humanitarian situation in flood-ravaged Pakistan is expected to get worse, Japan pledged to give emergency aid of $7 million, Qatar launched an air bridge and the UN refugee agency mounted a huge airlift operation from Dubai.
More than 33 million people in Pakistan have been affected by the flooding, brought on by record monsoon rains amplified by climate change.
The WHO said over 1,460 health centres had been damaged, of which 432 were fully wrecked, mostly in Sindh. More than 4,500 medical camps have been set up by the WHO and its partners, while more than 230,000 rapid tests for acute watery diarrhoea, malaria, dengue, hepatitis and chikungunya have been distributed.
Such diseases are already circulating in Pakistan, alongside Covid-19, HIV and polio, and “now all these are at risk of getting worse”, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said. “We have already received reports of increased number of cases of acute watery diarrhoea, typhoid, measles and malaria, especially in the worst-affected areas,” he said.

Greta Thunberg terms Pakistan ‘very clear example’ of European apathy to climate crisis

“The situation is expected to worsen,” he warned, as it was still difficult to get to areas hit hard by the floods.
Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa, while announcing the emergency assistance in Tokyo, noted that rain and flooding in Pakistan had led to over a thousand of deaths besides infrastructure damage.
Editorial: The floods are spawning a certain, and deadly, health crisis
Meanwhile, the UNHCR is scaling up support in Pakistan by mounting a huge airlift operation from Dubai meant to focus on Larkana and Sukkur. The first three of nine scheduled flights have already arrived here, with the other five on their way.
Aid includes 40,000 sleeping mats, nearly 15,000 kitchen sets and some 5,000 multi-purpose tarpaulins. An additional six flights are also scheduled from Dubai for Wednesday and Thursday, with 4,500 sleeping mats, 400 tarpaulins, and nearly 5,000 kitchen sets.
Global response to floods
Meanwhile, a host of international visitors are expected to Islamabad this week while some senior Pakistani leaders, possibly including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, may also visit world capitals for consultations later this month.
The most prominent among the visitors to Islamabad is the UN Sec­retary General, Antonio Gute­rres, who is arriving on Sept 9 to review the devastations caused by the floods.
Then on Sept 22, Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari is expected in New York to attend the UN General Assembly. He will then visit Washington on Sept 15 for talks with US officials.
Meanwhile, Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg complained in an interview to Reuters that politicians and the media in the West had “chosen not to communicate” that disasters like the floods in Pakistan and the climate change “are very closely interlinked”.
“Just take Pakistan now, as an example, a very clear example,” she said.
Fatima Bhutto, in a piece she wrote for The News York Times, stressed that “climate change very likely played a role in the extremely heavy rains” in Pakistan. “So, you can call these people climate refugees,” she argued.
On Tuesday, The Washington Post published a desperate appeal from Lawang, a flood victim in Mirpur­khas. “We have been here in these shelters for 16 days, but no one came to us,” he said. “No one is caring for us.”

BEIJING: Chinese firefighters worked in treacherous terrain on Tuesday to help evacuate more than 11,000 people after a 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck China’s mountainous southwestern province of Sichuan a day earlier, killing at least 66 people.
In Sichuan’s capital, Che­ngdu, authorities have maintained strict Covid-19 lockdown measures, which were not eased even after the tremors.
Social media footage sho­w­ed officials stopping res­i­dents from leaving their apartment buildings despite the tremors shaking the structures.
State media footage, take­n at the epicentre in Luding county, showed firefighters stretchering an injured person across a makeshift bridge built with tree trunks as mud­dy torrents raged below them.
The death toll from the strongest earthquake to hit China’s southwestern Sich­uan province since 2017 rose to 66 on Tuesday, though dozens of people were suffering heavy injuries.
On Tuesday, state television reported over 200 people were still stranded in Hail­uogou, a popular tourist spot known for its glaciers, verdant forests and soaring peaks. Rescuers were working to reopen roads to reach them.
Taiwan offers help
Meanwhile, Taiwan’s government expressed its condolences to China and said it was ready to send rescuers, in a sign of goodwill to Beijing despite weeks of military tensions.
China, which claims democratically-governed Taiwan as its own territory despite strong objections of the government in Taipei, has been carrying out drills around the island following a visit last month by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Taiwan’s presidential off­i­ce said President Tsai Ing-wen had offered her “sympathy and concern” after Mon­day’s quake in southwestern China which killed at least 46 people.

3,Suri’s move to accept MNAs’ resignations declared illegal,"Court rejects plea challenging phase-wise acceptance of resignations, tells PTI to approach NA speaker","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday said a decision taken by former National Assembly deputy speaker Qasim Suri in April this year, to accept the resignation letters of his party lawmakers without due verification, was against the law and Constitution.
The bench endorsed the phase-wise accep­t­ance of these resignations — a process initiated by incumbent speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf.
“The purported notification, dated [April 13], was, therefore, issued in violation of the Constitution and the principles and law enunciated by the superior courts as highlighted in the aforementioned judgement,” the high court order said, while referring to a judgement in the Zafar Ali Shah case.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah observed that the deputy speaker had no right to accept the resignations, adding that what Mr Suri did was against the law, reported Dawn.com.

Court rejects plea challenging phase-wise acceptance of resignations, tells PTI to approach NA speaker

As it dismissed the petition against the piecemeal acceptance of resignations, the high court told the PTI, represented by Faisal Chaudhry, to approach the NA speaker with a request to expedite the process as the court could not intervene in the affairs of parliament.
Mr Chaudhry argued that an inquiry or verification was not a condition for the acceptance of resignation under Article 64 of the Constitution and added that the resignations were accepted by the acting speaker vide notification, dated April 13.
He contended that the current speaker was not empowered to review the decision of his predecessor, acting speaker Qasim Suri. However, the court said the lawyer could not persuade the bench with his arguments.
During the hearing, Irfan Qadir raised multiple objections on behalf of the National Assembly Secretariat regarding the maintainability of the petition as he relied on the judgement of the IHC in the Syed Zafar Ali Shah case.
He said the speaker initiated verifying the resignations in light of the principles and law highlighted in the aforementioned judgement. The judgement made it mandatory for the speaker to “be satisfied that three factors are established; firstly, that it is tendered voluntarily; secondly, it is genuine; and lastly, that the member actually intended to relinquish, relieve or quit the post, position or seat and thereby vacate the seat.”

4,N-watchdog proposes ‘secure zone’ around Ukraine reactor,"“There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident,"" says IAEA.","

IN its report, the IAEA team has called for the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone around the reactor.—Reuters

 
VIENNA/KYIV: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Tuesday called for the establishment of a security zone around Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, currently occupied by Russia.The plant, which is operated by Ukrainian technicians, was captured by Russian forces in early March soon after they invaded Ukraine.
“The current situation is untenable,” the UN atomic watchdog said in a report after it sent a team to the plant last week.
The occupation of the nuclear power plant, Europe’s largest, has spar­ked fears of a nuclear disaster as both sides trade blame for shelling the site.
Ahead of the report’s release, Moscow and Kyiv accused each other of risking catastrophe by shelling the plant.
“There is an urgent need for interim measures to prevent a nuclear accident arising from physical damage caused by military means,” the IAEA said.
“This can be achieved by the immediate establishment of a nuclear safety and security protection zone,” it added in its report.
“The IAEA recommends that shelling on site and in its vicinity should be stopped immediately to avoid any further damages to the plant and associated facilities,” it said.
IAEA chief Rafael Grossi led the mission last week and two IAEA staff remain on site monitoring the situation.
At least two members of the team were to remain there on a permanent basis to ensure the facility’s safety.
The IAEA said Saturday the plant had been disconnected from its last remaining main power line to the grid and was relying on a reserve line.
On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned of a near “radiation catastrophe” at the plant and said Russia’s shelling of it showed Moscow “does not care what the IAEA will say”.

5,"Despite repeated disasters, Balochistan’s green belt far from ‘flood resilient’","Over the past decade and a half, the Nasirabad division has witnessed at least four major floods.","

QUETTA: Over the past decade and a half, the Nasirabad division has witnessed at least four major floods.
Consisting of the Jafferabad, Nasirabad, Jhal Magsi and Kachhi districts, this region is considered the ‘green belt of the province’, with agriculture being the primary occupation of most residents.
Displaced from the tiny village of Chowki Jamali in Jafferabad district, Misri Jamali tells Dawn that he had lived through three major inundations, while a fourth flood that struck the region did not reach his home.
This time, however, things are worse. Much worse.
“The flood has snatched each and everything from me and everyone around; agricultural land, mud homes, livestock, grain stocks, even the small shop that I owned [is now gone].”
A father of eight, Misri tells Dawn from a camp housing flood-hit displaced persons that they were not prepared for the magnitude of the torrents that hit their village.
“Each flood, from 2010 onwards, has wreaked havoc… We are not strangers to floods, but this time we thought the water would be less. We thought it would come later than it did,” he says, recounting how the waters struck while his family were soundly asleep in their beds.

“Since it was raining, we decided to wait until the morning before moving away. But we were wrong. By the time we stirred, there was water everywhere in our village and all other parts of the town,” he added, saying that he only managed to save his family members and could not salvage any possessions.
But unlike Misri, Arbab Jamali was not so lucky. He hails from Gandakha, a tehsil in Jafferabad district, bordering Sindh.
The Kirthar Canal, which supplies water to Gandakha via the Indus, had dried up before the arrival of torrential rains and floods.
According to locals, the mud deposits that accumulated in the canal were not cleared since the 2007 floods. This, they believe, was one of the reasons Gandakha remained drought-stricken until now.
The torrential rains and floods claimed the lives of five members of the same family in this small settlement, sending shockwaves through the community.
Mohammad Arbab Jamali is the head of this unfortunate family. “My wife Shazia who was in her 20s, Farah, (8 months), Shela (2) Shakeela (4) and my school-going brother Azhar Ali died, but I was not there at the time,” he says.
“Nobody knew the roof of the room had collapsed, since it had been raining non-stop for three days. The mud roof became damaged and fell on the children.”
For those still clinging to their lands, there is still no cellular network, electricity, and clean drinking water in the area. “The prices of daily use items like flour, rice, and potable water, among other things, have skyrocketed,” says Mehboob Jamali, who hails from the same town.
Even though the rains have abated and the sun has been shining there for weeks, many roads in Nasirabad division are still impassable.
Residents of Jafferabad, Dera Murad Jamali and other nearby areas have sought refuge in Sibi.
“We have been providing relief and food items to the residents of Nasirabad,” Mansoor Qazi, the bespectacled young deputy commissioner of Sibi, told Dawn.
This was the time for crops to ripen in the Nasirabad belt, but now all is destroyed,” says economist Mahfooz Ali Khan, putting the province’s financial challenges in perspective.
“There is nothing left here,” says Mehboob Jamali, who is preparing to leave for Quetta, the provincial capital. He is one of the lucky ones, at least he and his family have survived the worst. Many others were not so lucky.
