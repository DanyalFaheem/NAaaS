“No other candidate within the party is strong enough to take on PPP candidate Ali Musa Gilani,” he told the media here on Monday. 
Replying to criticism from within the party that Qureshi was promoting dynastic politics, he said he would not have fielded Mehr Bano Qureshi if the party had a strong candidate against Musa Gilani. 
Qureshi said he would visit youth leaders of the party to discuss the decision with them.  
“The decision was taken to support Chairman Imran Khan’s narrative and it was a difficult decision since we are a conventional family,” he said.  
He said girls could also play their role for the betterment of the country during difficult times.  
“Women comprise more than half the population of the country and they should have equal rights. Mehr Bano will highlight social injustice against women. As she is an educated lady with a journalistic background, she can better present women’s issues,” he said. 
He said he, his son and supporters would launch a joint campaign to support his daughter while Mehr Bano would herself reach women voters. 
Mr Qureshi said the party chairman would hold a rally on Aug 13 and he would announce his action plan against the “fascist government”. 
He said they would challenge the ECP decision of accepting selective resignations in the court.  
“Mr Khan will contest election on all these nine seats if the decision was not reversed,” he said.

2,Ex-MPA Nazir Chohan gets bail in workers clash case,"His bail has been accepted against surety bonds worth Rs50,000.","LAHORE: A local court on Monday granted bail to PML-N leader Nazir Chohan in the case of an armed clash between PTI and PML-N workers during the by-election (PP-167).
His bail was accepted against surety bonds worth Rs50,000.
The ex-MPA, his son and six others were arrested in the case of an armed clash between the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and PML-N workers during the by-election (PP-167).
The ex-MPA, his son Saad Chohan, Abid Ali, Qamar Abbas, Rafaqat Ali, Qasim Ali, Hafiz Rizwan and Faisal Maqbool were booked under sections 324, 353, 186, 506-B, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code and 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 at the Chuhng police station on Aug 1 for attacking a raiding team.
An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Thursday granted bail to PML-N leader Chohan, his son and six others involved in attacking a police party during his arrest subject to submission of surety bonds of Rs100,000 each.
Meanwhile, PTI newly-elected MPA Shabir Gujjar and Nazir Chohan set aside their differences and hugged each other on the premises of the Model Town court.  
MPA Gujjar recorded his statement in the court that he had no objection to granting bail to Chohan.  
Talking to the media, he said he wanted to work for the welfare of the people of his constituency and did not want any personal rift.
He further said that they wanted to end political fights.  
The Lahore police presented Nazir Chohan in the Model Town court after completion of his four-day physical remand in the case pertaining to attempted murder registered by Johar Town police. Deputy magistrate Asif Mustafa heard the case.
Ex-MPA Chohan through his counsel Sardar Akbar Dogar requested the court to approve his post-arrest bail application.
The applicant said the court had previously turned down a request for physical remand submitted by the police.
Mr Chohan said the Chuhng police had registered a false case against him to punish him for his political allegiance.
The court granted Mr Chohan bail against surety bonds worth Rs50,000.
Chohan was among the 25 PTI ‘dissident’ lawmakers who had voted for Hamza in the Punjab chief minister’s election held in April.  
The Election Commission of Pakistan, however, de-seated him on May 23 over defection and not obeying party instructions.
On July 17, Chohan contested elections on the ticket of PML-N for the seat he had previously won for the PTI in 2018. This time, he lost.

3,Yousuf Raza Gilani questions PTI participation in by-poll,"Since PTI MNAs are not participating in NA sessions after submitting resignations, they have no right to contest by-poll, he says.","LAHORE: PPP  vice chairman and former prime minister Senator Yousuf Raza Gilani has questioned PTI participation in the National Assembly by-election.  
“Since PTI MNAs are not  participating in the assembly session after submitting their  resignations, they have no right to contest the by-election,” he told media after visiting a number of mourning processions in Multan on Monday. 
Criticizing  Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Mr Gilani said Mr Qureshi was not attending the  assembly session and how his daughter (Mehr Bano Qureshi) would take  oath as an MNA if she won the by-poll in NA-157. He said people would  vote for a candidate having the ability to represent them in the  National Assembly instead of a candidate whose party was boycotting the  assembly after submitting resignations. 
Answering a question about the acceptance of PTI MNAs’ resignations, the former premier said their members had not been presented before Speaker Raja Parvez  Ashraf for verification of their resignations and when they were called,  they refused to come. 
About inflation, he said the previous government’s agreement with the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) on tough terms and conditions was the main reason behind inflation  in the country. He said the incumbent government was bound  to honour the international agreements which were not made with a political party but with the country. Mr Gilani maintained there  should be supremacy of law and constitution to  strengthen the country. Saying that the judiciary and Election Commission of Pakistan were independent, he asserted that the PPP always  honoured the court verdicts even when he was disqualified from  prime ministership despite the fact that he was an elected prime  minister. 
He said all senior leaders of different political  parties, including Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari,  remained in jail during the PTI government. 
The PPP leader  alleged that the commissioner Multan had submitted an application for  leave due to intense pressure on him before the NA-157 by-election and  demanded that the ECP take notice of it. 
Mr Gilani urged the masses to maintain peace during ongoing Muharram.

5,Safari’s aviary no more an attraction to visitors,Sources say aviary has lost its charm because of fewer birds.,"LAHORE: The bird aviary at the Lahore Zoo Safari, which was once full of birds, has now hardly 200 or so birds.  
Sources told Dawn that the aviary, which once was one of the most attractive parts of the Lahore Zoo Safari, had lost its charm because of fewer birds. The two pairs of macaws the aviary had died two and a half years ago and the facility did not bring the new macaws.  
The iron net sprawling over the aviary is in a state of disrepair as it was last installed in 2005.  
The aviary spread over two and-a -half acre has love birds, grey parrots, peafowl, pheasants, cranes, ducks, swans, partridges and other such birds. 
Tanveer Janjua, Safari in-charge, said the head office had been informed about the condition of the facility. He said aviary had developed cracks for being old. “We are doing repairs of the net to improve it,’’ said Janjua. He said that in future there are plans that the Safari would remain open till 10pm. And people could visit lion safari at night, he added.  
There’s plan to open a food street at the facility to attract more visitors, he added. 
Deputy Director Wildlife Headquarters Mudassar Hassan said having exotic birds in the aviary was possible with the availability of funds. 
“However, we have brought many new birds in the aviary and we are trying our best to have more beautiful birds.” As the new iron net over the aviary would cost a lot of money, the department had done necessary repairs and it was safe now, he said.  
He said landscaping of the aviary was also being done and birds such as pheasants, ducks and peacocks had been inducted in the aviary.

6,The logic behind ancient monuments of Lahore,"By understanding the reason monuments were created for, we might strongly feel the reasons they should be conserved and restored.","There is always logic as to why a building or a monument is located at any particular place or built in a certain time period. Sometimes the reason can be merely a display of power, though mostly it is a utilitarian reason. 
The architecture of a building or monument exposes its geographic and period influence. The old Lahore has a lot of historic buildings and the ones spared so far by our trader classes need to be understood. By understanding the reason they were created for, we might strongly feel the reasons they should be conserved and restored. 
Just a few things need to be made clear before we set off describing our subject monument in this piece. Religious monuments like temples, mosques, gurdwaras and churches abound in Lahore. Their time period matters while population mix matters the most as survival of a religious monument depends on the toleration levels of the ruling classes. 
But until 1947, the Walled City of Lahore, and Lahore outside the walls too, was not a Muslim majority area. Western Punjab certainly was. That’s why the mix promoted tolerance, which was once the hallmark of the city. Mind you, over the ages Lahore has been a Jain city, for 700 years a Buddhist city, a Hindu city and then, finally, a Muslim city as it is now. 
The oldest surviving mosque of Lahore is the ‘Neeven Masjid,’ followed by the first mosque that served the Mughal rulers, the Mori Masjid, built in 1630. That was followed by the mosque built by Emperor Akbar’s beautiful wife Mariam Zamani, located to the south-east of the Lahore Fort, but far away from the then Walled City. 
At this point, we need to understand that even the beautiful Mariam Zamani Mosque did not have a courtyard to accommodate even 250 persons. This merely meant that on Fridays, a royal entourage would leave Akbari Gate of the fort (The Alamgiri Gate did not exist then) and head for this small mosque. It was this compelling reason that there was a need for a large mosque with enough space in its courtyard to accommodate the Muslims of old Lahore. 
Thus we have the Subedar of Lahore, the Governor, Hakeem Ilumuddin Ansari, known better today as Wazir Khan who decided that he would build the largest mosque of Lahore in an open space in the new expanded eastern portion of the Walled City. The reason was that as Muslim numbers expanded, more space for collective worship was needed. 
Here we must make it clear that the Muslims were buried outside the ancient walled city then as we can see from the example of Ayaz, the handsome Georgian slave of the Turko-Afghan invader Mahmud of Ghazni. Today, his grave is in Rang Mahal and a part of the expanded old city. Same was the case with other Muslims. 
In the earlier Tughlaq period, we have the saint-seer Syed Ishaq Garezuni, better known as Miran Shah, also buried beyond where Ayaz was buried. Near this grave was that of Syed Suf, a follower of Miran Shah. They both played a huge part in explaining Islam to the people of Lahore. Nearby were other graves of the Muslims but far away from the original ancient walled city. We all know that Ali Hajveri was also buried a distance away from the south of the ancient city. 
Come the expansion and there was a huge open space – a garden – that was provided to the Subedar Wazir Khan by the emperor Shah Jahan, whom he had served since his childhood. In 1620, Wazir Khan was made a ‘Panj Hazari’ – a 5,000 horsemen cavalry leader. Once Shah Jahan came to power, Wazir Khan looked after the residential quarters inside the Lahore Fort. 
Ultimately, he was made the Subedar of Lahore and played a major role in bringing the emperor’s wife Mumtaz Mahal’s body from Burhanpur to Agra where ultimately he played a major role in the building the Taj Mahal. His role in the building of a few monuments like Naulakha in the Fort showed his taste and skill of putting together large monuments. 
Now he set about building a large mosque in the space provided as well as a Hamman inside Delhi Gateway to refresh and cleanse royalty as they entered Lahore after a long dusty journey. The building of the mosque posed a major problem for the once outside Muslim graveyard had two important graves there, those of Miran Shah and Syed Suf. Added to this were the Kakayzai inhabitants of the bazaar behind the planned mosque who held the two saints in high esteem. They immediately issued a ‘fatwa’ and work could not start. So a series of meetings among the Muslims of the area as well as Hindus, who held the saints in high esteem, set about. Ultimately, a solution was arrived at and the two saints were promised a marble tomb within the courtyard. 
As the outer surface had since risen, a two-tier grave monument was made but within the courtyard in such a way that it did not hinder the total design. Amazingly, the outer tomb was rebuilt in the British days over the lower courtyard from where a staircase leads to the original graves. 
Just a digression. If you notice that the foundations of the Shahi Hamman are a good 12 feet below the current upper road surface, we have the ‘Neeven Masjid’ existing 25 feet below the outer road surface as it is today. This reflects Lahore’s constant surface rise because of the environment being very dusty. This dust can be clearly seen by those flying into the city on aircraft. 
We will leave the architectural details for another time but what we know is that the Wazir Khan Mosque provided the people of Lahore with its first open courtyard for prayers. Small mosques had also come up but not for large collective worship. Here we see the last major Mughal emperor Aurangzeb come into play. His contribution was the Badshahi Mosque opposite the Lahore Fort as well as the massive Alamgiri Gateway of the fort. It was a contribution that today stands out. Experts point out that both monuments of Aurangzeb are more a display of power than of any other consideration. 
The ancient Walled City has so many such graves and temples that need immediate attention. They remind of an era where Lahore emerged as one of the great cities of the world. If only we can depend on archaeological and historic research to solve our past mysteries. There is just so much to learn.

10,The business of giving a makeover to resting place,"Labourer says for last 15 years, he has been regularly camping at Mai Shah's graveyard during Muharram and repairing graves.","SAHIWAL: Ali Ahmed with his wife Hafeezain Bibi and their three children arrives from village 79/4-R to Mai Shah graveyard for the repair of graves in the first 10 days of Muharram. 
The people visiting the graves of their near and dear ones hire the couple to give a makeover to the resting places with a fresh layer of clay mixed with straws. 
Ali is not alone to offer his services at the cemetery. More than 100 labourers from surrounding villages camp at the site during Ashura on Jamia Rasheedia Road for mud paste of graves. 
They say that each family earns Rs3,000 to Rs4,000 daily. 
There is a tradition among families to visit graveyards and throw flowers on the graves of their family members during Muharram and Eid days. This is the occasion when they get graves repaired, which are damaged due to rains.  
Mai Shah’s graveyard is a house to both Shia and Sunni people’s graves. 
Chaudhry Latif said most of the families visit the graves of their dear ones during Muharram and on Eid days and get them repaired annually. 
Saima Ahmed along with her nine-year-old daughter Ramsha arrived from Farid Town at the grave of her parents, aunt and uncle to pay them respect on Muharram 9.  
She said she bought flowers to place on graves. Later, many labourers surrounded her, offering their services for mud pasting of graves. 
Labourer Ali told Dawn that for the last 15 years, he has regularly been camping at the graveyard during Muharram and repairing graves.  
His wife Hafeezain Bibi said it was difficult to stay at makeshift places on the road in humid weather but they would earn more than Rs20,000 in these 10 days. 
Their day starts with a humble breakfast of tea and biscuits. Later on, they feed the family on the charity food which is dished out by visitors. 
Ali said he and his wife actually are road labourers and are employed in Mirpurkhas and Muzaffarabad with different road contractors. 
He charges Rs300 to Rs500 for one grave’s paste. They have a plastic bag, a plastic cane and a bag of dry straw. Once the deal is struck, Ali fetches water while Hafeezan prepares clay. The couple pastes the clay on graves while their children watch them work.

12,Drugs are just a phone call away in Sialkot,Issue highlighted after video clip showing minor girl taking drugs under Shahabpura overhead bridge goes viral on social media.,"NAROWAL: Drug peddlers are operating in different areas of Sialkot city without any check by the police concerned, causing concern among the citizens, especially the parents of youngsters who are becoming addicts due to easy availability of drugs.  
The issue was highlighted recently after a video clip showing a minor girl taking drugs under the Shahabpura overhead bridge in the middle of Sialkot city went viral on social media. 
According to locals, the drug dealers are openly selling ice, heroine, marijuana, besides local and imported liquor, to the youth in the city, while the police were just looking other way or in some cases patronising such elements.  
They say that a group of influential dealers has hired youngsters, who are called ‘shooters’, for delivering drugs to their customers at their doorstep on a phone call.  
They deplored that instead of taking action against these drug dealers, some police officials were conniving with such elements to keep the illegal trade running.  
They say that on being pressurised by senior police officers for action against big dealers, the officials at police station level only book addicts in drug cases, showing recovery of small quantities of narcotics to show their performance.     
They say following such fake recoveries, local police issue press releases to satisfy their high-ups, but the actual peddlers keep operating freely.  
They regretted that because of home delivery of drugs, a large number of youngsters are becoming addicts in Sialkot, adding that the girl’s video clip that went viral just showed the tip of the iceberg, while the ground reality was far more grave.    
An other resident, Mujahid Ali, says the drug dealers enjoy police patronage and some police officials have also become investors in the narcotics business.  
He says the boundaries of two police stations -- Agoki and Hajipura -- converge at Shahabpura overhead bridge, where dozens of addicts take drugs openly but no action is taken.  
Sialkot District Police Officer Syed Zeeshan Raza said the police were taking strict action against the drug dealers, adding that he had sought a report on the girl’s drug taking video clip.
The citizens demanded Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi should take immediate notice of the situation and order the police to act against the drug peddlers.

16,Lahore bridge expansion may complete by September-end,Project will ease traffic flow from Kalma Chowk to Gajjumata.,"LAHORE: The construction of the Lahore bridge (Qainchi intersection, Ferozpur Road) expansion project is likely to be completed by end of next month, as around 75 per cent of work has been done.  
The project lingered on owing to delay in issuance of NOC from Pakistan Railways, shifting of utility services and other technical issues, it is learnt.  
“I don’t think the project will complete by end of the ongoing month. However, I can say that we will complete and open this to traffic by September-end subject to having an impediment-free environment,” Project Director Mobeen Asghar said while talking to Dawn on Monday.  
The Lahore bridge expansion is a part of the Rs1.711 billion Gulab Devi underpass project. The underpass was opened to traffic a couple of months ago while work on the bridge expansion couldn’t pick momentum due to delay in NOC from the Pakistan Railways that was supposed to allow the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) to carry out piling, girder launching while crossing over the railway lines at the intersection.  

Project will ease traffic flow from Kalma Chowk to Gajjumata

The need for Lahore bridge emerged after the LDA in a survey, prior to launch of the project, came to know that the traffic heading towards Gajjumata and Kasur from Kalma Chowk stuck at the existing Lahore bridge due to low width of the road (two lanes). However, there is no issue with traffic proceeding towards Kalma chowk from Gajjumata and Kasur while passing this spot as this side of the bridge has a three-lane road stretch.
“Keeping in view this, we decided to expand the bridge (the two-lane side heading towards Gajjumata, Kasur) by construction another two-lane flyover along with the existing one with a space of one meter. And finally we launched the construction work side by side the work on the Gulab Devi underpass,” Mr Asghar explained.  
He said work related to the addition of a two-lane overhead bridge along with the existing one remained slow because of the NOC issue. Meanwhile, the project team was also not allowed to get the construction carried out on a regular basis due to non-observance of power shutdown in a bid to avert possibility of electrocution-related incidents, shifting of poles, wires, cables due to various reasons - Ramazan, Eid, Muharram and hot weather.  
“The Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) is yet to shift a heavy tower of 132kV transmission line. Moreover, the shifting of Sui gas-related services are also to be done,” he said, adding that the curing of pilings, girders also takes time.
“Hopefully, we will be able to complete this portion of the project by end of next month, as there is no hurdle at the moment,” he said.  
Asghar said with the addition of two more lanes, the issues related to traffic congestion at this point would come to an end.  
LDA’s newly-appointed DG Aamir Ahmad Khan also inspected the project a couple of days back. During the visit, he was briefed by LDA Chief Engineer (II) Mazhar Hussain Khan about the pace of work, delay, future strategy for completion of the project.  
The DG directed the chief engineer, project director and others concerned to accelerate construction work and complete the project at the earliest.  
It merits mentioning that the LDA also faced issues related to shifting of electricity, gas services, non-observance of shutdowns, land acquisition while implementing the Shahkam Chowk flyover that was finally opened to traffic on July 8.  
The Rs4.233bn Shahkam Chowk flyover project had been launched on-time in July last year. However, the land acquisition (64 kanal) was delayed for some time due to procedural issues.  
According to official sources, the Rs4.3bn Saggian Road Rehabilitation Project would also be completed soon as the work is under way these days.  
In May, the newly-constructed Rs5bn Sheranwala Gate flyover project had also been opened to traffic, easing mobility of the people crossing the area to reach Ravi Road. However, some at-grade works including the allied ones - construction of a road with protected U-turns, slip roads, concrete pavement, shifting of utility services were completed later.
