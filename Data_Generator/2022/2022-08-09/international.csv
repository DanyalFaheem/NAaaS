0,EU submits ‘final text’ at Iran N-talks,"“Now the ball is in the court of the capitals and we will see what happens,” says European official; Iran examining document.","VIENNA: The European Union submitted a  “final text” at talks to salvage a 2015 deal aimed at reining in Iran’s nuclear ambitions and Tehran said on Monday it was reviewing the proposals.
Britain, China, France, Germany, Iran and Russia, as well as the United States indirectly, resumed talks on Thursday in Vienna, months after they had stalled.
The European Union has submitted a  “final text”, a European official said on Monday.  “We worked for four days and today the text is on the table,” the official told reporters on condition of anonymity.
“The negotiation is finished, it’s the final text... and it will not be renegotiated.”  “Now the ball is in the court of the capitals and we will see what happens,” the European official added.  “No one is staying in Vienna.” The official said he hoped to see the  “quality” text accepted  “within weeks”. Iran said it was examining the 25-page document.
“As soon as we received these ideas, we conveyed our initial response and considerations,” state news agency IRNA quoted an unnamed foreign ministry official as saying. “But naturally, these items require a comprehensive review, and we will convey our additional views and considerations.” 
On Sunday, Iran demanded the UN nuclear watchdog  “completely” resolve questions over nuclear material at undeclared sites.
Iranian sources have suggested a key sticking point has been a probe by the International Atomic Ene­r­gy Agency (IAEA) on traces of nuclear material found at undeclared Iranian sites.
“That has nothing to do with” the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) agreement of 2015, the European official said.
“I hope Iran and the IAEA will reach an agreement because that will facilitate a lot of things.”
The UN agency’s board of governors adopted a resolution in June, censuring Iran for failing to adequately explain the previous discovery of traces of enriched uranium at three previously undeclared sites.
“We believe that the agency should completely resolve the remaining safeguard issues from a technical route by distancing itself from irrelevant and unconstructive political issues, Iran’s foreign minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Sunday.
Kelsey Davenport, an expert at the Arms Control Association, warned against abandoning the IAEA probe in a bid to revive the JCPOA, which she called  “the most effective way to verifiably block Iran’s pathways to nuclear weapons”.
If the United States and the other signatories to the 2015 deal do not support the UN body, it will  “undermine the agency’s mandate” and broader non-proliferation goals, she wrote on Twitter.

1,Russia suspends strategic arms inspections over US restrictions,"Inspection conditions proposed by US ""effectively deprive"" Russia of right to conduct inspections in US, says foreign ministry.","MOSCOW: Russia told the United States on Monday it would not allow its weapons to be inspected under the START nuclear arms control treaty for the time being because of travel restrictions imposed by Washington and its allies.
Inspection conditions proposed by Washington created  “unilateral advantages for the United States and effectively deprive the Russian Federation of the right to conduct inspections on American territory,” the Moscow foreign ministry said in a statement.
Russia remained fully committed to complying with all the provisions of the treaty, it added.
The United States and its allies including Britain and the European Union closed their airspace to Russian planes as part of a barrage of sanctions imposed in response to Russia’s decision to send its armed forces into Ukraine in February.
The New START Treaty, which came into force in 2011, caps the number of strategic nuclear warheads that the United States and Russia can deploy, and the deployment of land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers to deliver them.
US President Joe Biden said last Monday that his administration was ready to  “expeditiously” negotiate a framework to replace New START, which is due to expire in 2026, if Moscow demonstrated its willingness to resume work on nuclear arms control.
But Russia’s mission to the United Nations said Washington had withdrawn from separate talks with Moscow on strategic stability over the Ukraine conflict, and needed to decide what it wanted.
The following day, the Kremlin said time was running out to negotiate a replacement for New START, putting global security at risk.
The conflict in Ukraine has raised political tensions to levels not seen since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, with politicians in both Russia and the United States speaking publicly of the risk of World War Three.
Moscow says it was forced to intervene in Ukraine to defend Russian-speakers from persecution and avert a Western threat to use Ukraine to threaten Russia’s security. Kyiv and its Western allies say these are baseless pretexts for an imperial-style land grab.

2,India plans to restrict sale of phones by Chinese firms,"Chinese smartphone makers Xiaomi and Vivo accused of illegal remittances and money laundering,","NEW DELHI: India is seeking to restrict Chinese companies from its sub-$150 phone market in a bid to revive the prospects of domestic players, Bloomberg News reported on Monday, citing unidentified sources.
The move would be a blow to Chinese companies such as Xiaomi, according to the report. The plans coincide with rising concerns in India about Chinese brands undercutting local smartphone makers, it added.
It is unclear if the Indian government will announce policies or use informal channels to execute the block on Chinese smartphone makers, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter.
Chinese firms account for a major chunk of entry-level smartphones that are popular among users shifting away from traditional devices in India, which is the second largest mobile market in the world.

Smartphone makers Xiaomi and Vivo accused of illegal remittances and money laundering

Indian firms such as Lava and MicroMax rapidly gained popularity after their launch over a decade ago, but have since lost market share to stiff competition from Chinese players.
Many Chinese companies have struggled to do business in India due to political tensions following a border clash in 2020. India cited security concerns in banning more than 300 Chinese apps, and has also tightened rules for Chinese companies investing in India.
Xiaomi and rival Vivo are being investigated by India’s financial crime fighting agency for alleged illegal remittances and money laundering. Both deny any wrongdoing.
The companies and the Indian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report.

3,Afghan man suspected of killing 10 in Iran,Attacker stabs 10 people to death in Kerman province due to  “personal differences”; suspect arrested.,"TEHRAN: An attacker stabbed 10 people to death in Kerman province in southern Iran due to  “personal differences”, before being arrested by police, state media reported on Monday.
On Sunday,  “an Afghan national killed ten people due to personal differences in Rafsanjan,” Hossein Rezai, acting governor of the city, was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.
He  “was arrested by the police as he attempted to leave the province” in the evening, Rezai added. Six Afghans and four Iranians were killed in the attack in a rural area, he said. One person was also wounded.
State broadcaster IRIB said that the suspect was reportedly  “mentally unstable” and addicted to drugs.
Iran has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for decades, but fresh waves have flooded through the shared 900-kilometre (550-mile) border between the countries since the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan last year.

4,"US not trying to ‘outdo’ other powers in Africa, says Blinken",PRETORIA: The United States is seeking a  “true partnership” with Africa and not trying to  “outdo” other...,"PRETORIA: The United States is seeking a  “true partnership” with Africa and not trying to  “outdo” other world powers in vying for influence on the continent, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Monday.
Blinken outlined the US government’s new Africa strategy as he visited South Africa in the first stop of a three-nation trip to the continent.
The visit followed hot on the heels of an extensive African tour by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Yet Blinken said the United States did not see the region as the  “latest playing field in a competition between great powers”.
“Our commitment to a stronger partnership with Africa is not about trying to outdo anyone else,” the top US diplomat told a press briefing in the capital, Pretoria, alongside his South African counterpart Naledi Pandor.
South Africa, a leader in the developing world, has remained neutral in the Ukraine war.
Pretoria has refused to join Western calls to condemn Moscow, which had opposed apartheid before the end of white-minority rule in 1994.
Pandor said no one in South Africa supported war and described Russia as a  “negligible economic partner” but added she was glad the United States was not asking her country to take sides.
However, there had been  “a sense of patronising bullying” from other partners in Europe and elsewhere, she said.
“We should be equally concerned at what is happening to the people of Palestine, as we are with what is happening to the people of Ukraine,” she said, referring to a flare-up in fighting in Gaza.
Later on Monday, in a lecture at the University of Pretoria, Blinken laid out the new US strategy for sub-Saharan Africa, which he said focused on four priorities — fostering  “openness” and democracy, pursuing economic development, and tackling global warming.
The United States and African nations needed to work together as  “equal partners” to address those issues, he said. “Too often, African nations have been treated as instruments of other nations’ progress, rather than the authors of their own,” he said.
“The United States will not dictate Africa’s choices, neither should anyone else. The right to make these choices belongs to Africans, and Africans alone.” The new strategy was announced at the end of an extended policy review by President Joe Biden’s administration.
Some critics say a US focus on fighting extremist groups in Africa militarily has borne little fruit, even while China and Russia have made continued inroads by aggressively using diplomatic and economic tools.

5,"Western parts found in Russian weapons used in Ukraine, says think tank","Strengthening of export restrictions could make it harder for Russia to replenish its arsenal of weapons, it says.","LONDON: More than 450 foreign-made components have been found in Russian weapons recovered in Ukraine, evidence that Moscow acquired critical technology from companies in the United States, Europe and Asia in the years before the invasion, according to a new report by Royal United Services Institute defence think tank. 
Since the start of the war five months ago, the Ukrainian military has captured or recovered from the battlefield intact or partially damaged Russian weapons. When disassembled, 27 of these weapons and military systems, ranging from cruise missiles to air defence systems, were found to rely predominantly on Western components, according to the research shared with Reuters. 
It is the most detailed published assessment to date of the part played by Western components in Russia’s war against Ukraine. 
About two-thirds of the components were manufactured by US-based companies, RUSI found, based on the weapons recovered from Ukraine. Products manufactured by the US-based Analog Devices and Texas Instruments accounted for nearly a quarter of all the Western components in the weapons. 
Other components came from companies in countries including Japan, South Korea, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. 
“Russian weapons that are critically dependent upon Western electronics have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Ukrainians,” Jack Watling, a land warfare specialist at RUSI, said. 
While many of the foreign components are found in everyday household goods such as microwaves that are not subject to export controls, RUSI said a strengthening of export restrictions and enforcement could make it harder for Russia to replenish its arsenal of weapons such as cruise missiles. 
In one case, a Russian 9M727 cruise missile, one of the country’s most advanced weapons that can manoeuvre at low altitude to evade radar and can strike targets hundreds of miles away, contained 31 foreign components. The parts were made by companies that included US-based Texas Instruments Inc and Advanced Micro Devices Inc, as well as Cypress Semiconductor, which is now owned by Infineon AG, a German company, the RUSI investigation found. 
In another case, a Russian Kh-101 cruise missile, which has been used to strike Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv, also had 31 foreign components with parts manufactured by companies including US-based Intel Corporation and AMD-owned Xilinx. 
In response to questions about how their chips ended up in Russian weapons, the companies said they comply with trade sanctions and they have stopped selling components to Russia. 
Analog Devices said the company closed their business in Russia and instructed distributors to halt shipments to the country. 
Texas Instruments said it follows all laws in the countries where they operate and the parts found in the Russian weapons were designed for commercial products. Intel said it “does not support or tolerate our products being used to violate human rights.” 
Infineon said it was “deeply concerned” if its products are being used for purposes which they were not designed for. AMD said it strictly follows all global export control laws. 
Many of the foreign components only cost a few dollars and Russian companies would have been able to buy them before the start of the Ukraine invasion online through domestic or international distributors because they could be used in non-military applications. 
However, more than 80 Western-manufactured microchips were subject to US export controls since at least 2014 meaning they would have required a licence to be shipped to Russia, RUSI said. The companies exporting the parts had a responsibility to carry out due diligence to ensure they were not being sent to the Russian military or for a military end-use, according to RUSI.

7,Gustavo Petro sworn in as Colombia’s first leftist president,Former guerilla leader’s hard-fought victory expands left-wing fold in Latin America.,"BOGOTA: Gustavo Petro on Sunday took the oath of office as Colombia’s first-ever leftist president, before a crowd of hundreds of thousands at his inauguration in Bogota.
The 62-year-old former guerilla and one-time mayor takes over from the deeply unpopular Ivan Duque, with plans for profound reforms in a country beset by economic inequality and drug violence.
Petro’s hard-fought victory in June elections brought Colombia, long ruled by a conservative elite, into an expanding left-wing fold in Latin America.
“I swear to God and promise the people that I will faithfully enforce the constitution and the laws of Colombia,” said Petro before the large crowd of supporters gathered in Bogota’s Bolivar Square.

Former guerilla leader’s hard-fought victory expands left-wing fold in Latin America 

Petro — whose government should enjoy support from a left-leaning majority in Congress — called in his inaugural address for Colombian armed groups to  “lay down their arms” and accept legal benefits  “in exchange for peace.” 
He also took aim at decades of counter-narcotics efforts, saying:  “It is time for a new international convention recognizing that the war on drugs has failed.” And he called for the creation of an international fund to help the deforestation-plagued Colomb­ian Amazon.
On the campaign trail, Petro had promised during his four-year term to raise taxes on the rich, invest in health care and education, and reform the police after a brutal crackdown on anti-inequality protests last year that was internationally condemned.
He has vowed to suspend oil exploration, to promote clean energy and to reactivate diplomatic and commercial relations with the government of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, suspended since 2019.
Petro starts from an  “enviable position, with a large majority in Congress and, in terms of the street, with support that no government had in recent years,” analyst Jorge Restrepo of the Resource Center for Conflict Analysis (Cerac), said.
Maduro congratulated Petro on his inauguration, saying in a video:  “I extend my hand to the people of Colombia, to President Gustavo Petro, to rebuild brotherhood on the basis of respect and love between peoples”.
The Venezuelan leader had not been invited to the ceremony by outgoing president Duque, whose office oversaw preparations for the event.
Duque had also denied a request by Petro to have the sword of revolutionary figure Simon Bolivar present at the ceremony — a decision the new president quickly reversed right after taking his oath.
The sword, which was eventually brought by ceremonial guards to Bolivar Square, was of particular significance for Petro, as it had decades ago been stolen by the M-19 guerilla group of which he was once a member, before being returned in 1991 after a negotiated peace deal.
‘Critical’ debt burden
Petro’s presidency is historic in another sense, too: by his side will be the country’s first-ever Afro-Colombian woman vice-president, 40-year-old environmental and women’s rights activist Francia Marquez.
The pair will grapple with an economy reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, a spike in violence and deep-rooted anger at the political establishment that culminated in last year’s protests.
Almost 40 percent of Colombia’s 50 million people live in poverty, while 11.7 percent are unemployed. Inflation in July also reached 10.2 percent year-on-year.
On Monday, a preparatory commission set up by Petro said he was inheriting  “a level of indebtedness and fiscal deficit that... is critical.” Thousands of Colombians descended on Bogota’s main square to celebrate Petro’s inauguration and his promise of change.
“We feel very grateful... to the millions of Colombians who believed in change and today we are going to start working together hand in hand to achieve it,” said Alexandra Rojas, a supporter of the new president. Others could not contain their excitement.
“I am happy to see the inauguration of our president Gustavo Petro, what a happiness, I can’t contain it, the happiness is great, the change has happened, the change has arrived,” said Ruth Perez, wrapped in the colours of the national flag.
Peace talks 
Petro has promised to implement outstanding provisions of the 2016 peace agreement that saw the rebel FARC movement lay down arms after nearly six decades of civil conflict. The former mayor of Bogota has also vowed to pursue negotiations with the National Liberation Army (ELN) armed group.
Despite the FARC disbanding to become a political party, Colombia has seen a surge in violence.
Thousands of dissidents continue to battle the ELN and powerful cartels for control of drug fields, illegal gold mines and lucrative smuggling routes.
According to the Indepaz peace research institute, there are 90 armed groups with some 10,000 members active in Colombia, the world’s largest producer of cocaine.
Petro has proposed allowing armed groups to hand themselves over in exchange for some form of amnesty. Colombian presidents serve only one term.

8,UN chief seeks access to Ukraine N-plant after attack,"“Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,” he says.","TOKYO: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called on Monday for international inspectors to be given access to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant after Ukraine and Russia traded accusations over the shelling of Europe’s largest atomic plant at the weekend.
“Any attack to a nuclear plant is a suicidal thing,” Guterres told a news conference in Japan, where he attended the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Ceremony on Saturday to commemorate the 77th anniversary of the world’s first atomic bombing.
Ukraine said renewed Russian shelling on Saturday had damaged three radiation sensors and hurt a worker at the Zaporizhzhia power plant, the second hit in consecutive days on the site.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of waging  “nuclear terror” that warranted more international sanctions, this time on Moscow’s nuclear sector.
“There is no such nation in the world that could feel safe when a terrorist state fires at a nuclear plant,” Zelenskiy said in a televised address on Sunday.
Russian forces captured the plant in southeastern Ukraine in early March but it is still run by Ukrainian technicians.
The Russian-installed aut­h­ority of the area said Ukrainian forces hit the site with a multiple rocket laun­cher, damaging administrative buildings and an area near a storage facility. The Russian embassy in Washi­ngton also released a statement itemising the damage.
“Ukrainian nationalists launched an artillery strike on the territory of the specified object on Aug 5. Two high-voltage power lines and a water pipeline were damaged as a result of the shelling. Only thanks to the effective and timely actions of the Russian military in covering the nuclear power facility, its critical infrastructure was not affected,” the embassy said. 
Events at the Zaporizhzhia site — where Kyiv alleged that Russia hit a power line on Friday — have alarmed the world. Guterres said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) needed access to the plant.
“We fully support the IAEA in all their efforts in relation to create the conditions of stabilisation of the plant,” Guterres said.
IAEA chief Rafael Mariano Grossi warned on Saturday that the latest attack  “underlines the very real risk of a nuclear disaster”.
Elsewhere, a deal to unblock Ukraine’s food exports and ease global shortages gathered pace as another four ships sailed out of Ukrainian Black Sea ports while the first cargo vessel since Russia’s Feb 24 invasion docked.
The four outgoing ships had almost 170,000 tonnes of corn and other food. They were sailing under a deal brokered by the United Nations and Turkey to try to help ease soaring global food prices that have resulted from the war.
Before Moscow’s Feb 24 invasion, which Russian President Vladimir Putin calls a  “special military operation”, Russia and Ukraine together accounted for nearly a third of global wheat exports. The disruption since then has threatened famine in some parts of the world.
Putin’s troops are trying to gain full control of the Donbas region of east Ukraine where pro-Moscow separatists seized territory after the Kremlin annexed Crimea to the south in 2014.

9,Schroeder escapes being booted out of German ruling party,"BERLIN: Former Ger­man chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Monday escaped being humiliatingly booted out of his party,...","BERLIN: Former Ger­man chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Monday escaped being humiliatingly booted out of his party, as the ruling Social Democrats (SPD) found his ties with Vladimir Putin did not breach its rules.
Schroeder, 78, has come under growing criticism since Russia’s February invasion of Ukraine over his continued friendship with Putin and his links to Russian energy companies. The SPD’s Hanover branch, where his membership is registered, opened a hearing in July to discuss 17 motions from local and regional chapters against his ongoing membership of the party.
But the branch said in a statement on Monday that the former chancellor was  “not guilty of a violation of the party rules, as no violation can be proven against him”.
The decision can be appealed, but legal experts say there are high hurdles for expelling members. Schroeder, chancellor from 1998 to 2005, has refused to turn his back on the Russian president despite the Ukraine war.
His stance has made him an embarrassment to the SPD, which is also the party of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
He has also been widely criticised for holding a number of lucrative posts at Russian energy giants, and it was only after much public pressure that Schroeder in May gave up his seat on the board of Russian energy group Rosneft.
He later also announced he would not be joining Gazprom’s supervisory board as initially planned.
Germany’s parliament in May removed some of the perks Schroeder was entitled to as an elder statesman, stripping him of an office and staff. But Schroeder, who was Angela Merkel’s immediate predecessor, has remained defiant and met with Putin in Moscow in July.
In an interview after the visit, he claimed Russia wanted a  “negotiated solution” to the war — comments branded as  “disgusting” by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
Schroeder has also called on Berlin to reconsider its position on the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which stands completed but was blocked by the German government in the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine.
Opposition lawmaker Thorsten Frei, from the centre-right CDU party, on Monday said the decision not to expel him was  “bad for the SPD, but also bad for our whole country”.

10,China holds fresh military drills around Taiwan,"BEIJING: China carried out fresh military drills around Taiwan on Monday, Beijing said, defying calls to end its...","BEIJING: China carried out fresh military drills around Taiwan on Monday, Beijing said, defying calls to end its largest-ever exercises encircling the island in the wake of a visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
Beijing has raged at the trip by Pelosi — the highest-ranking elected US official to visit Taiwan in decades — ripping up a series of talks and cooperation agreements with Washington, most notably on climate change and defence.
It has also deployed fighter jets, warships and ballistic missiles in what analysts have described as practice for a blockade and ultimate invasion of the self-ruled democratic island that China claims as its territory.
Those drills had been expected to draw to a close on Sunday, but China said they were still ongoing.
“The eastern theatre of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army continued to carry out practical joint exercises and training in the sea and airspace around Taiwan island,” the military said. The exercises, the PLA’s Eastern Command added, were  “focusing on organising joint anti-submarine and sea assault operations”. Taipei condemned Beijing for extending the drills.
“China’s provocation and aggression have harmed the status quo of the Taiwan Strait and raised tensions in the region,” the island’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
The Taiwanese military said it detected 39 Chinese warplanes and 13 ships operating in the strait on Monday.
Of those, 21 aircraft crossed the median line — an unofficial demarcation between China and Taiwan that the former does not recognise.
US President Joe Biden expressed concern on Monday but said he did not expect the situation to escalate further.
“I’m not worried, but I’m concerned they’re moving as much as they are. But I don’t think they’re going to do anything more than they are,” Biden told reporters at Dover Air Force Base. Taiwan has remained defiant throughout the Chinese drills.
Its military said it would hold anti-landing exercises in Taiwan’s south on Tuesday and Thursday.
“We will practise counter moves against simulated enemy attacks on Taiwan,” Lou Woei-jye, spokesman for the Eighth Army Corps, said.
They will include the deployment of hundreds of troops and about 40 howitzer guns, the military said.
Taiwan has insisted that no Chinese warplanes or ships have entered Taiwan’s territorial waters — within 12 nautical miles of land — during Beijing’s drills.
But to show how close it came to Taiwan’s shores, the Chinese military released a video of an air force pilot filming the island’s coastline and mountains from his cockpit.
The Eastern Command also shared a photo it said was of a warship on patrol with Taiwan’s shoreline visible in the background.
Ballistic missiles were fired over Taiwan’s capital during the exercises last week, according to Chinese state media. The scale and intensity of China’s drills — as well as its withdrawal from key talks on climate and defence — have triggered outrage in the United States and other democracies.
Beijing on Monday defended its behaviour as  “firm, forceful and appropriate” to American provocation.

11,Police strip-searched 600 London children: official,"Data show most of the children strip-searched over a period of two years were black boys; England commissioner ""deeply shocked"".","LONDON: London’s under-fire police force strip-searched more than 600 children over a two-year period, most of them black boys, according to new data released on Monday.
England’s commissioner for children, Rachel de Souza, said she was  “deeply shocked” by the figures after obtaining them from the Metropolitan police.
De Souza’s request came after Britain’s biggest police force was forced to apologise in March over the case of  “Child Q”, which has sparked an investigation for gross misconduct into four officers. The 15-year-old black schoolgirl was strip-searched by female officers in 2020 after being wrongly suspected of carrying cannabis, despite them being aware she was menstruating.
She was searched without an  “appropriate adult” present, and neither was an adult in attendance in 23 percent of the cases unearthed by de Souza. In total, 650 minors aged 10-17 were strip-searched by Met officers between 2018 and 2020, she found. More than 95 percent were boys, and 58 percent of the 650 were described by the officer as being black.

12,US Senate passes ‘historic’ bill envisaging 40pc emission cut by 2030,Bill should provide launchpad for green investment and kickstart a transition towards renewable energy inworld’s largest emitter.,"PARIS: Scientists on Monday welcomed the passing of US President Joe Biden’s  “historic” climate bill while calling for other major emitters — namely the European Union — to follow suit and implement ambitious plans to slash emissions.
The bill, which would see an unprecedented $370 billion invested in cutting US emissions 40 percent by 2030, should provide a launchpad for green investment and kickstart a transition towards renewable energy in the world’s largest emitter.
It passed the Senate on Sunday night after months of arduous negotiations and only after a number of tax and energy provisions were tacked on to Biden’s original proposal.
Michael Pahle, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said the bill was particularly relevant to EU lawmakers, who he said were on the verge of adopting  “the world’s most ambitious climate policy” in the form of the bloc’s  “Fit for 55” plan. “The EU’s policy can only succeed — economically and politically — when major emitters and trade partners take similar action,” he said.
“Especially in face of the changing geopolitical landscape, US-EU cooperation is key and the bill an important enabling factor.” The EU initiative — which envisages a 55-percent emissions fall by 2030 — has no set budget as yet.
But a recent assessment found member states would need to spend an 350 billion euros more each year than they did between 2011-2020 in order to hit the climate and energy targets.
Simon Lewis, professor of global chance science at University College London, said the US bill showed how lawmakers can advance climate legislation while responding to voters’ short-term concern over fuel price inflation.
“It’s really important that the world’s largest economy is investing in climate and doing it as part of a package to generate jobs and a new, cleaner, greener economy,” Lewis said.
“Part of that is a package tackling inflation. I think that shows the world how to get climate policy passed, by hitching it to things that really matter to ordinary people, to make sure it’s part of an overarching package to make life better for people.”
‘Massive increase’
The independent Rhodium Group think tank said the  “historic and important” bill — officially the Inflation Reduction Act — would reduce US emissions by at least 31 percent by 2040, compared with 2005 levels.
However it said that with favourable macroeconomic conditions including increasingly high fossil fuel prices and cheap renewables, a 44-percent emissions drop was possible. “The cost of living is here partly because we didn’t get out of fossil fuels early enough,” said Lewis.
“This bill means is that the transition away from fossil fuels is about to speed up.” Eric Beinhocker, director of the Institute of New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, said the bill would lead to a  “massive increase” in clean technology and would drive the cost of renewables down even further.
“This is particularly important when the world is suffering not just from the climate effects of fossil fuels but also from their skyrocketing costs,” he said.
The legislation provides millions to help conserve forests and billions in tax credits to some of the country’s worst-polluting industries to accelerate their transition to greener tech.
It almost didn’t happen, however, with the bill delayed for months after Democrat Joe Manchin blocked Biden’s more expensive Build Back Better infrastructure plan.

13,Russian TV protester ordered to pay new fine for ‘discrediting’ army,Journalist Marina Ovsyannikova has denounced Russia’s intervention in Ukraine.,"MOSCOW: A Moscow court on Monday ordered journalist Marina Ovsyannikova, who denounced Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, to pay a new fine for discrediting the Russian army.
In March, Ovsyannikova shot to prominence for interrupting a live TV broadcast to denounce Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine. Her lawyer did not rule out on Monday the possibility she could face a criminal probe in the future. Last week, another court ordered the 44-year-old journalist to pay 50,000 rubles (around $800) for discrediting the Russian army.
On Monday, Ovsyannikova, a former editor at state-controlled Channel One, said Moscow’s Cheryomushkinsky district court ordered her to pay 40,000 rubles.
Ovsyannikova’s lawyer Dmitry Zakhvatov said she was fined for a post on Facebook. Two convictions within the space of six months can lead to a criminal case.
In court, Ovsyannikova said she  “trolled” the judge but he did not seem to understand her irony.
“America and Europe are to blame for the fact that there is no longer freedom of speech, just courts and fair elections in Russia. And people are put in jail for calling for peace,” she said in court, according to her statement on messaging app Telegram.
Ovsyannikova, a mother of two, was briefly detained in July. Her short detention came several days after she demonstrated alone near the Kremlin, holding up a sign criticising the military intervention in Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin.
After sending troops to Ukraine, Moscow adopted laws imposing sentences of up to 15 years in prison for spreading information about the military deemed false by the authorities.
