I. Khan, Bannu, Tank, Haripur, Khyber, Mohmand, Charsadda, Hangu and Lakki Marwat.\nThe KP government\u2019s petition said the PHC order came as a shock and surprise since it focused solely on its decision to hold elections on non-party basis. \nThe petition argued that this point was never agitated before the high court by the respondents or petitioners.  The KP government too did not assist the high court on this matter.\nTo comply with Article 140A of the Constitution, which requires provincial governments to establish a local government structure and devolve administrative and financial powers to elected representatives at the lowest tier, the KP government had announced the schedule for local government elections, the petition stated.\nBut the provincial government was surprised to receive a court notice that a writ petition filed with the PHC had sought a declaration that the KP Local Government (Amendment) Act 2019 was ultra vires of the Constitution, the petition said.\nIt argued that the short order of Nov 2 had superimposed a \u201csingle quasi-national model\u201d for local government elections, whereas it was desirable that every province be allowed to adopt a system of its choice. \u201cThe PHC order ignores the ground realities of different regions,\u201d the KP government contended.\nThe petition said countries around the world, including India, allowed their federating units to choose a local government model in consonance with their needs and traditions.\nThe petition observed that the Peshawar High Court\u2019s order had injured the \u201cbasic structure of elections practised or developed over a long period of time\u201d.  \n\u201cNon-party elections will make elected representatives more accountable to the pub\u00ad\u00adlic and will discourage patronage politics.\u201d\nPublished in Dawn, November 20th, 2021\n", "2": "RAWALPINDI: Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa on Fri\u00adday said Pakistan desired to maintain the tradition of bilateral engagement and wished a long-term and enduring relationship with Bahrain.\nThe army chief expressed these views during a meeting with Speaker of the Cou\u00adncil of Represen\u00adtatives of Kingdom of Bahrain Fawzia Bint Abdullah Zainal who cal\u00ad\u00adled on him here, said an Inter-Services Public Relat\u00adions (ISPR) media release.\nDuring the meeting, matters of mutual interest, current security situation in Afghanistan and bilateral cooperation in various fields were discussed.\nThe COAS reiterated the need for global convergence on Afghanistan to avoid humanitarian crisis and coordinated efforts for economic development of the Afghan people.\nPublished in Dawn, November 20th, 2021\n", "3": "KARACHI: The current account deficit has widened by $1.6 billion in October. \nThe data issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday showed the current account deficit was higher than September while it continued to increase its size in terms of GDP from 4.1 per cent to 4.7pc. \nThe deficit has already gone much beyond the target which was in the range of 2-3pc of GDP for the entire current financial year. \nThe increasing deficit has a vast negative impact on foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate regime which has resulted in the depreciation of rupee by 13.4pc during the current financial year. \n\nThe gap has already crossed the targeted level\n\nIn terms of dollars, the current account deficit increased by $1.663bn in October, while the deficit for the first four months (July-October) of the current financial year rose to $5.084bn. \nThe real reason behind the current account deficit is the growing size of imports.  \nAccording to the SBP data, the imports in July-October went up by 66.3pc to $23.484bn against $14.118bn recorded in the same period of FY21. \nThe deficit on balance in goods and services during this period was $14.845bn compared to $7.546bn of same months of the previous financial year. \nThe imports of goods in October went higher by $6bn reflecting the failure of policy measures taken by the central bank and the government. \nThe first quarter result had already reflected the trend for trade and current account deficit as it rose to 4.1pc of GDP. \nThe increasing current account deficit resulted in the pressure on exchange rate as the local currency lost 13.4pc against the US dollar during FY22. \nThe government had succeeded in reducing the current account deficit from $20bn in FY18 to $1.9bn in FY21 but the growing size of the recent deficit could be in the range of about $10bn provided the current situation persists for the rest of the financial year.\nThe current account deficit in September was $1.113bn compared to $1.473bn in August.

Miners in Balochistan also face the risk of targeted attacks by non-state actors. \nBased on a sample of mines visited by the team, on-site healthcare appeared to be an exception rather than the norm, a handout showed. \n\n176 miners killed, 180 injured in several accidents this year   \n\nGiven that coal mining is internationally classified as a hazardous occupation, mine owners and contractors must ensure that every mining site has a functioning ambulance service and an on-site emergency health worker, and that regular internal safety inspections are carried out, Mr Naqi stressed. \nWith respect to external safety inspections, the fact that only 27 mine inspectors are available to oversee health and safety in more than 6,000 mines in the province is also a cause for concern. \n\u201cThe mission\u2019s broad findings reveal that the majority of coal miners are not registered with the Employees\u2019 Old-Age Benefits Institution or other social security programmes, which leaves them highly vulnerable once they are no longer able to work,\u201d he pointed out. \nMoreover, the compensation for death and injury is lower in Balochistan (i.e. Rs300,000) compared to other provinces (Rs500,000). \nAccording to the HRCP, many labour union representatives also say they are deeply unhappy with the contractor system of operating coal mines because contractors have little stake in ensuring the safety and security of their workers and resort to cost-cutting measures.  \nIt is also a matter of concern that, in many cases, contractors themselves function as the heads of labour unions, which is a potential conflict of interest. \nThe HRCP also recommended that the government upgrade the status of the coal mining sector to an industry and hold both mine owners and contractors accountable for running their sites in line with the provisions of the Mines Act of 1923 and subsequent amendments. \nThe commission also urges the government to ratify and implement ILO Convention 176 on safety and health in mines as soon as possible, besides investing in health, education and infrastructure, especially in and around coal mining areas and across the province in general. \nThe mission\u2019s report will be released as soon as possible, Mr Naqi said.\nPublished in Dawn, November 20th, 2021\n", "7": "QUETTA: Opposition and treasury benches in the Balochistan Assembly on Friday expre\u00adssed concern over the disappearance of two university students and asked the authorities to get them recovered immediately. \nOn the first day of the winter session, presided over by Deputy Speaker Sardar Babar Khan Musakhail, former chief minister Nawab Aslam Raisani took up the issue on a point of order and said earlier people had disappeared from different areas, but now students had started going missing from educational institutions. \n\u201cDisappearance of students from Balochistan University is a very serious matter which could not be ignored,\u201d he said. \nBoth the students have been missing since Nov 1. \nSpeaking on the issue, provincial minister Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran said he was not satisfied with the vice chancellor\u2019s report regarding abduction of students. \nHe said the IG police had assured that the students were not in police custody. \u201cIt is the responsibility of the state to recover the missing students,\u201d he added. \n\u201cThe deployment of security forces has been reduced in educational institutions of Balochistan.
