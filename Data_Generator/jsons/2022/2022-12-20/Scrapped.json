(right) The badly broken rails of the down track. \u2014 Dawn\n\n \nLAHORE:  Two men were killed on Monday after the Karachi-bound 34-down Pak  Business Express collided with a motorcycle-rickshaw at an unmanned  level-crossing between Kahna and Jia Bagga stations, about 20km from the  Lahore main railway station. \nThe accident also caused derailment  of the engine, a luggage van and two passenger coaches besides damaging  the track badly due to applying of emergency brakes by the driver. The  deceased included the rickshaw driver and a man travelling with him. \nThe  train, according to official sources of the Pakistan Railways (Lahore  division), left the Lahore railway station at about 4pm for  Karachi. When it was about to reach the point of an unmanned crossing between the Kahna and Jia Bagga  stations, it hit a  motorcycle-rickshaw which appeared on the track from nowhere . \n\u201cThe  accident took place at 4:46pm. Though the driver applied emergency  brakes, he couldn\u2019t avert the collision. The rickshaw driver and the  passenger travelling with him died on the spot,\u201d says a spokesman for  the PR police. \nHe said all the passengers including the crew  travelling in the derailed and other coaches remained safe. Senior  officials, including the divisional superintendent and deputy  superintendent of the PR police, also reached the spot.\n\u201cA relief  train carrying a crane was also dispatched to the site that put the  derailed coaches and engine on the track,\u201d he added. \nOn the other  hand, the entire train operation on the down track (between Lahore and  Raiwind) remained suspended for several hours, as the rehabilitation of  the track, putting coaches and engine back on the track took time. \n\u201cWe  also sent a locomotive to the site that brought all the coaches - other  than the derailed ones - back to the Kot Lakhpat railway station. We did it  in a bid to attach two new coaches and a locomotive with the rake in  order to dispatch the train,\u201d a PR (Lahore Division) spokesman told Dawn.  \nHe said due to closure of the down track, all Karachi-bound trains were diverted to the up-track from Kahna station.\nIt  merits mentioning that a number of accidents frequently happened from  2019 to 2022 included many at unmanned crossings in Pakistan. These  included killing of 22, including 20 Sikh pilgrims, in July 2020 after a  train rammed into a bus at Sucha Soda, a small town near  Farooqabad in Sheikhupura district.  \nAnother similar accident  happened near Pattoki at an unmanned level crossing when a train hit a  car carrying two newly-wed couples who died on the spot. \nTill December 2020, there were 3,000 unmanned  crossings across the country, with 550 in Lahore division which also includes Sheikhupura, Okara and Faisalabad. \u201cAt unmanned level crossings, it is, under the law, purely a  responsibility of road users to cross carefully. Law also allows taking  necessary legal action against those crossing a railway track at an  unmanned level crossing in case of an accident,\u201d said an official. \nHe said as many as 100 unmanned crossings and unauthorised passages were closed by the PR (Lahore division). \nHe  said if any railway servant notices a transport vehicle crossing a  class 3 level crossing without complying with the requirement of section  91 (i) of the West Pakistan Motor Vehicle Ordinance 1965, its number  with available particulars shall immediately be brought to the notice of  the sectional permanent way inspector of railways or the nearest  station master shall promptly report the matter to police. \n\u201cThe  driver of a transport vehicle who desires to pass over a railway level  crossing shall cause the vehicle to stop before the crossing and shall  not attempt to pass over the crossing unless permission of the conductor  of the vehicle, or where the vehicle has no conductor, a person  authorised in this behalf by the owner of the vehicle in writing other  than the driver of the vehicle walks before the vehicle until it has  cleared the railway line (sic),\u201d reads section 16.9 of the ordinance. \nHe  said similarly as per Railway Act 1890, the responsibility for upgrade  of unmanned level crossing lies with the provincial governments and road  authorities concerned, for whom the ministry of railways may provide  all possible technical assistance.\nPublished in Dawn, December 20th, 2022\n", "1": "LAHORE: Former chief minister of Punjab Sardar Usman Buzdar said on Monday the criticism of him by Chief Minister Chaudhry Parvez Elahi was in fact \u201cthe criticism of the narrative of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).\u201d\n\u201cI served the people of the province honestly for over three years.
