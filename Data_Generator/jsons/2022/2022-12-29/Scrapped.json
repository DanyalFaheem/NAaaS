trading until next hearing into a relevant case on Jan 17.\nIt also directed owners of those markets to produce two surety bonds each of Rs500,000 and adjourned hearing into the matter.\nThe Federal Investigation Agency had sealed the Hafeez Market, Faiz Market and Azad Market early this month over the alleged smuggling of US dollars.\nJustice Wiqar Ahmad of a single-member bench issued the de-sealing order after hearing petitions of the owners of those markets, including Hafeezur Rehman, Haji Niaz Mohammad and Noor Habib.\n\nStops forex trading there until next hearing\n\nIn almost identical petitions, market owners challenged the sealing of their respective premises and the issuance of notices to them by the FIA under Section 5(5) of the FIA Act.\nIn the notices, the agency alleged that traders of those markets were damaging the economy by carrying out the illegal businesses of hundi, hawala and black marketing of US dollars.\nAdvocate Danyal Asad Chamkani appeared for the petitioners and said the FIA had sealed the markets of his clients without having powers to do so.\nHe said the FIA had issued notices to the petitioners under Section 5(5) of the FIA Act, whereas the said provision did not authorise the sealing of any premises by it.\nReferring to that legal provision, the counsel said, \u201cIf, in the opinion of a member of the FIA conducting an investigation, any property which was the subject-matter of an investigation was likely to be removed, transferred or otherwise disposed of before an order of the appropriate authority for its seizure is obtained, such member may direct the owner not to remove, transfer or otherwise dispose of such property in any manner except with previous permission of such member.\u201d\nHe added that the law\u2019s section in question didn\u2019t empower the FIA to seal a property.\nThe lawyer argued that the petitioners were the owners of their respective markets comprising several shops, which were rented out.\nHe contended that if the tenants were involved in any illegal business of money exchange, the FIA should act against them individually instead of targeting market owners.\nMr Chamkani pointed out that apart from money exchange dealers there were also shops dealing in other businesses.\nDeputy attorney general Sanaullah rejected the arguments of the petitioners\u2019 counsel and stated that several FIRs were registered against different money changers having shops in those markets.\nHe said another high court bench headed by Justice Roohul Amin Khan heard an identical petition a few days ago, so those cases might also be fixed for hearing by it.\nThe bench directed the high court\u2019s relevant office to fix petitions before a bench headed by Justice Roohul Amin Khan on Jan 17, the next date of hearing.\nIt, however, granted interim relief to the petitioners by issuing directives to de-seal their markets.\nThe FIA recently conducted raids in the Chowk Yadgar area known for forex trading and sealed four markets and plazas having dozens of shops. It claimed that the action was taken to eliminate the black marketing of US dollars and strengthen the rupee.\nPublished in Dawn, December 29th, 2022\n", "1": "PESHAWAR: Chief Minister Mahmood Khan has alleged that federal government wants to create financial instability and disturb peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nChairing a meeting on the law and order in the province here on Wednesday, he termed the indifferent attitude of federal government towards KP a matter of serious concern, according to a statement.\n\u201cThe indifferent attitude of the incumbent federal government is a matter of serious concern which is causing multiple issues for the province,\u201d said the chief minister.
