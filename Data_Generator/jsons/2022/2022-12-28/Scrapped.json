It delineates functions of each of the organs,\u201d the bench observed.\nThe court observed that adversarial functions of the court on any authority would then obviously offend the basic theory of trichotomy.\nThe court also discussed different offices of ombudsmen established under different laws including that of the federal ombudsman (wafaqi mohtasib), federal tax ombudsman, banking mohtasib, insurance ombudsman, etc. and their respective powers.\nReferring to different judgments of the superior courts, the bench ruled that the office of an ombudsman fell in the executive limb of the state though he performed his functions as quasi-judicial and could record evidence, investigate a matter and functioned as a watchdog on government institutions.\nIt added that it was high time that the issue where a woman was deprived of her property more particularly in inheritance, the provincial government should pass an appropriate legislation to safeguard the women rights but within the sphere of the Constitution.\nThe bench observed that it was conscious of the fact that in the present legal dispensation and in the absence of appropriate legislation, the women were normally deprived of their share provided in the Sharia in their inherited property.\nIt ordered the sharing of its judgement with the law and justice department for appropriate action.\nWhile referring to different provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding mode of attachment of immovable properties, the bench observed that Rule 54 of the CPC\u2019s Order 21 did not allow in any way the court to take actual possession of the disputed property and despite issuance of attachment order it remained within the possession of defendants.\nIt added that ordering sealing of any property by the ombudsperson was not backed by any law and any order for attachment of immovable property should be implemented and interpreted in the manner provided in the said rule.\nThe court declared the impugned order of the ombudsperson, allowing the sealing of the disputed property, as without jurisdiction and set it aside. However, the order of attachment, the bench ruled, of the disputed property should remain in the field.\nIt ruled that there was an apparent disparity between sections 4 and 7 of the Act, which had an inherent defect.\nThe bench declared that Section 4 provided that a woman, who was deprived of her ownership or possession of the property, might file a complaint to the ombudsman if no proceedings in a court of law were pending regarding the property.\nIt added that Section 7 empowered the ombudsman to entertain a complaint in respect of any dispute relating to a property right of a woman despite the pendency of claim before the competent court of law.\nPublished in Dawn, December 28th, 2022\n", "2": "PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has decided to make deductions from the salaries of 3,800 teachers of BPS-17 and above for absenting duty.\nThe decision was taken during a high-level meeting regarding the monitoring mechanism in the education department held here on Tuesday with secretary elementary and secondary education Muttasim Billah Shah in the chair.
