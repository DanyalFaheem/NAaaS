all due pension payments to the petitioners forthwith until any decision was taken by a committee constituted by the higher education department to determine their status.\nIt declared that as pension payment was necessary for the well-being and peace of mind of the retirees as well as it was their right, their petition was accepted by the court.\nThe petition was jointly filed by former ICP associate professor Sher Haider and 260 other pensioners seeking the court\u2019s directives for the respondents, including the UoP vice-chancellor, to release the monthly pension of all former employees withheld since August without further delay.\n\nRules payments will be made to ICP pensioners until govt\u2019s decision on their status\n\nThe petitioners prayed the court to declare void the July 26 letter sent by the UoP registrar to the vice-chancellor of the Islamia College University Peshawar (ICUP) for the payment of pension to the pensioners, who had served in the Islamia College Peshawar, the erstwhile constituent college of the UoP.\nThe UoP has stopped the payment of pension to the petitioners insisting that after the establishment of the ICUP, the ICP was no longer its constituent college and therefore, the pension for petitioners should be released by the ICUP.\nThe counsel for petitioners, Nazeer Ahmad, said his clients were pensioners of the UoP as they\u2019d either retired on attaining the age of superannuation or their family members were the former staff members.\nHe contended that the UoP consisted of other postgraduate departments and undergraduate colleges, including the ICP and Islamia Collegiate School.\nThe lawyer said the pensioners were recruited in line with the procedure prescribed by the UoP and they had served the university until reaching the age of superannuation.\nHe said the terms and conditions of service of the teachers or employees applicable to other employees were also applicable to the employees of the ICP and Islamia Collegiate School\nThe counsel contended that retirement orders for them or their relatives were issued by the UoP as the competent authority.\nHe added that the benevolent fund contribution, the GP Fund and the pension contribution all were deposited in the UoP\u2019s funds and by all means of law, they (petitioners) were the UoP\u2019s employees.\nThe lawyer said the UoP had also paid petitioners gratuity, encashment of the \u201cleaves prior to retirement\u201d and all ancillary pensionary benefits to them until July 2022.\nHe said the ICP got the status of the university through a separate Act passed by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly in 2009 and the UoP continued to pay pensions of former staffers of ICP and Islamia Collegiate School.\nThe counsel appearing for the UoP contended that ICP was no longer constituent college of UoP and it was now attached with the ICUP and therefore, the petitioners should be paid pension by the latter.\nHe pointed out that for resolving the dispute and determining status of the petitioner the higher education department had constituted a committee through a notification on Sep 23.\nThe lawyer contended that the UoP had already been facing financial problems and was not in a position to pay the pension of the petitioners.\nThe bench observed that it reflected from the record that prior to the upgradation of the ICP as university until Aug 2022, the petitioners had been paid their due pension by the UoP without break or ifs and buts.\nIt added that the petitioners had been paid all pensionary benefits by the respondents since the completion of service term, the act of withholding such benefit to them won\u2019t make sense.\nThe bench ruled that the respondents had insisted that the university was
