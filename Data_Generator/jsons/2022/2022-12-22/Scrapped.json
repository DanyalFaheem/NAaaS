Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government on Wednesday blamed the security issue in the province on the ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan\u2019s government in April this year.\nIt also flayed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s administration on the criticism of the province\u2019s police and counter-terrorism department over the seizure of the CTD centre in Bannu.\nAccompanied by adviser to the chief minister on home Babar Salim Swati and higher education minister Kamran Bangash, finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra told reporters here that security challenges surfaced in the province after the removal of Prime Minister Imran Khan from power and that the \u201cregime change\u201d was responsible for the current law and order situation in the province.\nHe said a comparison of the security situation before and after the Shehbaz-government in the centre was enough to confirm his assertion.\nThe minister said terrorist activities on the country\u2019s western borders began in 2001.\nHe said the post-2001 deaths in the province\u2019s tribal districts (erstwhile Fata) outnumbered those reported nationwide during the period showing how \u2018ignorant\u2019 interior minister Rana Sanaullah and defence minister Khwaja Asif were about such casualties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very sad to hear [remarks of members of the federal cabinet],\u201d he said.\nMr Jhagra said the security situation had improved after the fencing of western borders and that was maintained by the centre and not KP.\nHe blamed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s administration for the province\u2019s financial challenges.\nThe minister said in the third letter to former adviser to PM Shehbaz Sharif on finance Miftah Ismail, he had warned that the continued denial of funds by the centre to the province could lead to security challenges in the province.\nHe said his government had to make \u201ccompromises on different things\u201d due to those funding denial.\nAide to the chief minister Babar Saleem Swati said the \u201cregime change\u201d had led to \u201csecurity pressure\u201d, so he wondered why the state institutions continued to support Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s administration.\n\u201cWhat is happening right now [in the province] is just because of the regime change in the country,\u201d he insisted.\nHe said KP acted as a buffer zone on the Western border.\nMr Swati said the sacrifices rendered by the province showed that its forces and residents continued to stand firm against militancy.\nHe said the provincial government had established CTD regional offices and would set up a few more soon.\nMinister Kamran Bangash said there was a huge difference between the law and order situation in the province before and after 2013.\nHe said the federation should behave like a federation.\nMr Bangash said the provincial government, police and CTD were vigilant and were taking all necessary steps to maintain the law and order situation in the province.\n\u2018We will fight militancy together,\u201d he said.\nPublished in Dawn, December 22nd, 2022\n", "2": "MANSEHRA: A man was burnt to death when his house caught fire in Mohallah Lughmani
