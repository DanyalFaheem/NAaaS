0,World heads into New Year facing Covid ‘tsunami’,PARIS: Millions around the world braced on Thursday for drastically curtailed New Year celebrations as record...,"PARIS: Millions around the world braced on Thursday for drastically curtailed New Year celebrations as record coronavirus cases fuelled by the Omicron variant saw the WHO warn a Covid “tsunami” threatens to overwhelm healthcare systems.
Coronavirus, first detected two years ago and declared a global pandemic in March 2020, has killed more than 5.4 million people, triggered economic crises and seen societies ricochet in and out of lockdowns.
The latest variant, Omicron, while tentatively considered to cause milder illness, has pushed infection levels to record levels in recent days in the United States, Britain, France and other European countries, forcing governments to reimpose restrictions.
The number of daily new Covid cases worldwide crossed one million for the first time, according to a tally, with more than 7.3 million in the last seven days.
From Greece to Mexico, from Barcelona to Bali and across swathes of Europe, authorities have cancelled or curtailed public gatherings, either closing or imposed curfews on nightclubs. In France, wearing masks outdoors will be compulsory while walking the streets of Paris from Friday for everyone over the age of 11. Nightclubs have been closed until well into January.
In Spain, public festivities have been cancelled across most regions and in the biggest cities except Madrid, where a stripped-down gathering is scheduled with the crowd limited to 7,000 people compared to 18,000 in 2019 before the pandemic swept Europe.
On Thursday, Britain’s National Health Service announced that it would start opening temporary field hospitals to contain a possible overspill of inpatients in England, where the government stopped short of mandating curbs on New Year festivities.
“Given the high level of Covid-19 infections and increasing hospital admissions, the NHS is now on a war footing,” National Medical Director Stephen Powis said.
Indonesia, which has reported more than 4.2 million confirmed cases, warned that foreign travellers may be deported from the resort island of Bali if they are caught violating Covid health rules during New Year.
“Get ready to be kicked out,” Bali immigration office head Jamaruli Manihuruk said. Bali has barred carnivals, fireworks and gatherings of more than 50 people over the Christmas and New Year period.
Mexico City has also cancelled its massive New Year’s Eve celebrations as a preventative measure after a rise in Covid cases.
“I feel that this casts doubt on a lot of what we thought was already secure, because it is scary, it is worrying,” said Aaron Rosas, an engineering student.
“By doing that cancellation they are sending a message in a way: ‘You know what? This is serious’,” said teacher Victor Arturo Madrid Contreras.
In Saudi Arabia, authorities reimposed social distancing measures at the Grand Mosque in the Muslim holy city of Mecca, after recording the highest number of infections in months.
“I am highly concerned that Omicron, being more transmissible, circulating at the same time as Delta, is leading to a tsunami of cases,” said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.

1,Taliban chief orders fighters not to ‘punish’ ex-officials,Says general amnesty announced after the Islamists took power in August should be honoured.,"KABUL: The Taliban’s supreme leader has ordered fighters not to punish members of Afghanistan’s former regime for past “crimes”, days after a video of an army commander being beaten went viral on social media.
The order, tweeted on Thursday by group spokesman Mohammad Naeem, also urged Taliban authorities to discourage Afghans from leaving the country as they would not be respected abroad.
“Don’t punish employees of the previous regime for their past crimes,” Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada was quoted as telling followers in Kandahar, the birthplace of the hardline Islamist movement.
The Taliban chief — who has not been filmed or photographed in public for years — said a general amnesty announced after the Islamists took power in August should be honoured.
The Taliban are accused by the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch of dozens of extrajudicial killings of members of the former security forces and administration.
On Wednesday, the group said the fighter seen repeatedly slapping an ex-army commander in a widely shared video would be disciplined.
It was a rare official reaction to dozens of similar — and more grisly — videos and images on social media showing apparent Taliban brutality.
On Tuesday, a small group of women protested in the capital Kabul against the violence.
Thousands of Afghans — particularly those linked to the former regime — are desperate to leave the country, but Akhundzada said Taliban officials should encourage them to stay.
“Afghans don’t have respect in other countries, so no Afghan should leave,” Naeem quoted him as saying.
The exodus has been exacerbated by a collapsed economy and a humanitarian crisis that the UN warns has caused “an avalanche of hunger”.

2,Protesters set former Australian parliament on fire,The blaze occurred when police broke up a traditional Aboriginal smoking ceremony by a small number of activists at the entrance.,"SYDNEY: Australia’s former parliament building caught fire during a rights protest on Thursday, officials said, with the flames causing limited damage.
The blaze occurred when police broke up a traditional Aboriginal smoking ceremony by a small number of activists at the building’s entrance.
The Canberra building was home to the country’s federal parliament from 1927 to 1988 and now houses the Museum of Australian Democracy.
The museum said in a statement that it is “closed until further notice while we address fire damage caused by protesters today”.
There was no immediate news about the extent of the damage, but images showed flames and smoke coming from wooden double-doors at the building’s entrance.
The vast majority of the edifice remained untouched, and the blaze was said to have been quickly extinguished.
Activist Albert Hartnett said in a Facebook post that police had used pepper spray to break up the demonstration, which he alleged had caused the roof of a portico to catch fire.
The National Heritage Register-listed building has been the scene of a series of protests by an “Aboriginal Tent Embassy” in recent weeks. Past protests included lighting a fire by the building’s doors and were said to have been linked to so-called sovereign citizen groups.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was “disgusted” and “appalled” by an attack on what he called a symbol of democracy.
“People should face the consequence of their actions,” he said.

3,Hindu religious leader held for insulting Gandhi,NEW DELHI: Indian police on Thursday arrested a Hindu religious leader for allegedly making a derogatory speech...,"NEW DELHI: Indian police on Thursday arrested a Hindu religious leader for allegedly making a derogatory speech against India’s independence leader Mohandas Gandhi and praising his assassin.
Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead by a Hindu extremist during a prayer meeting in the Indian capital in 1948, because he was considered sympathetic towards Muslims during the partition of the Subcontinent by British colonialists in 1947.
Kalicharan Maharaj was arrested in central Madhya Pradesh state on Thursday for allegedly promoting hatred between religious groups in a speech earlier this week, the Press Trust of India news agency cited police officer Prashant Agrawal as saying.
According to media reports, Maharaj said “Gandhi destroyed the country ... salutations to Nathuram Godse, who killed him.”
He will be formally charged in court after the police complete an investigation. If convicted, he can be jailed up to five years.
Attacks by Hindu hardliners against Muslims and other minorities have intensified after Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, and won a landslide re-election in 2019.
The opposition is also demanding the arrest of several saffron-robed Hindu religious leaders for making highly provocative speeches against Muslims at a closed-door religious parliament, known as Dharam Sansad, earlier this month in the northern holy city of Haridwar.
They called on Hindus to arm themselves for “a genocide” against Muslims, according to a police complaint.
Police in Uttarakhand state, which is ruled by Modi’s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, said they were questioning suspects. No arrests have been made. Muslims comprise nearly 14pc of India’s 1.4 billion people.

4,Ghislaine Maxwell convicted of teenagers’ abuse,NEW YORK: Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty by a US jury on Wednesday of helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein...,"NEW YORK: Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty by a US jury on Wednesday of helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls, sealing a remarkable fall from grace for the British socialite.
Maxwell, 60, was accused of recruiting and grooming four teenagers between 1994 and 2004 for Epstein, her former boyfriend who killed himself in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges of his own.
She was convicted on five of six counts, including one count of sex trafficking. Lawyers for Maxwell, who faces up to 65 years in prison, vowed to appeal.
Maxwell’s trial was widely seen as the reckoning Epstein never had and one of the highest-profile cases in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to speak out about sexual abuse by famous and powerful people.
During the month-long trial, jurors heard emotional and explicit testimony from four women who portrayed Maxwell as central to their abuse by Epstein. Three of the four said Maxwell herself took part in the encounters, which often began as massages.
Maxwell’s attorneys sought to undermine the women’s credibility, arguing that they were motivated by money to implicate Maxwell since all four had received million-dollar awards from a compensation fund for Epstein’s victims.
But the women disputed those characterisations, saying they decided to testify out of a desire for justice, not money. “Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me,” testified one woman, known by her first name Carolyn.
Her case was at the heart of the sex trafficking charge because she said Maxwell would sometimes hand her hundreds of dollars in cash after she gave Epstein erotic massages in his Palm Beach, Florida estate.
The jury deliberated for five full days before reaching the verdict.
After the verdict was read, Maxwell, wearing a burgundy turtleneck, poured herself a glass of water. Defence attorney Jeffrey Pagliuca patted her upper back. An expressionless Maxwell looked briefly at two of her siblings seated in the front row as she left the courtroom.
Blow for Andrew
The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell for sex trafficking is a further blow for her embattled royal former friend Prince Andrew, British media said on Thursday.
Andrew has denied sexually assaulting one of Epstein’s alleged victims, who is suing him in the United States.
Virginia Giuffre has launched a civil claim suing Andrew for unspecified damages, alleging he sexually assaulted her when she was 17, a minor under US law. She claims she was lent out by Epstein to his powerful associates and forced to have sex with Andrew three times — the first time at Maxwell’s London home.
The prince has repeatedly and strenuously denied this, saying he does not remember meeting Giuffre and “absolutely and categorically did not have sex with her”.
He has not been criminally charged. Buckingham Palace has reiterated this denial. Andrew withdrew from royal duties after a widely derided 2019 television interview where he attempted to clear his name.
A famous photo apparently shows Andrew with Maxwell at her London house, while he has an arm around Giuffre’s naked midriff. Andrew has suggested the photo could have been doctored.

5,Iran conducts space launch amid nuclear talks,"“The Simorgh (Phoenix) satellite launcher carried three research cargos into space,” says defence ministry spokesman.","TEHRAN: Iran announced on Thursday it has carried out a new space launch, in a move likely to irk Western powers amid tough talks on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal.
Tehran successfully put its first military satellite into orbit in April 2020, drawing a sharp rebuke from Washington.
Western governments worry that satellite launch systems incorporate technologies interchangeable with those used in ballistic missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.
Iran insists its space programme is for civilian and defence purposes only, and does not breach the nuclear deal or any other international agreement. UN Security Council Resolution 2231 of 2015, endorsing the nuclear deal, imposed no blanket ban on Iranian rocket or missile launches.
Iran’s state broadcaster aired footage of a rocket rising from a desert launchpad, but gave no details of its location. “The Simorgh (Phoenix) satellite launcher carried three research cargos into space,” said defence ministry spokesman Ahmad Hosseini.
“The research goals foreseen for this launch have been achieved,” he added, quoted by state television.
Earlier this month US media reported that preparations for a launch were under way at Iran’s space centre in Semnan, 300 kilometres east of Tehran.
Hosseini did not elaborate on the nature of the research, but he said the latest operation was a “preliminary launch” and that more would follow.

6,Saudi Arabia boosts pandemic measures at Grand Mosque,Authorities say they will reimpose “social distancing requirements between worshippers and pilgrims”.,"RIYADH: Saudi Arabia on Thursday reimposed social distancing measures at the Grand Mosque in Makkah, after recording the highest number of infections in months.
Workers have returned floor markings removed on October 17 to guide people to social distance in and around the Grand Mosque.
Saudi authorities said they will reimpose “social distancing requirements between worshippers and pilgrims” at the Grand Mosque, without specifying whether a capacity has been set.
Earlier, the government had said social distancing and masks were again required in both indoor and outdoor venues.
The country of approximately 34 million people has so far recorded more than 554,000 coronavirus cases, including 8,874 deaths, the highest number of fatalities among the Gulf Arab countries.
On Wednesday, Saudi recorded 744 cases, the highest number since mid-August.
The Covid-19 pandemic hugely disrupted Muslim pilgrimages, which are usually key revenue earners for the kingdom, bringing in some $12 billion annually.
The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states — Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar — have been recording their highest numbers of new cases in months.
Despite having the world’s highest vaccination rate, the UAE has recorded the largest number of infections among Gulf countries at more than 757,000.
On Wednesday, it recorded 2,234 infections, the highest number since June.
The Emirates’ Abu Dhabi crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, sought to reassure the people that “the UAE health sector is fully geared and prepared to address any challenges”, according to the official WAM news agency.
The UAE is gearing up to host New Year’s Eve celebrations, including at Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest tower, in the emirate of Dubai.
Dubai, which is heavily dependent on tourism, was one of the world’s first destinations to welcome back visitors in July 2020.
It is also counting on the six-month Expo 2020 trade fair to boost its economy.

7,Destitute ‘heir’ of last Mughal emperor demands royal residence,"Sultana Begum lives in a slum near Kolkata, surviving on a meagre pension","KOLKATA: A destitute Indian woman who claims she is heir to the dynasty that built the Taj Mahal has demanded ownership of an imposing palace once home to the Mughal emperors.
Sultana Begum lives in a cramped two-room hut nestled within a slum on the outskirts of Kolkata, surviving on a meagre pension.
Among her modest possessions are records of her marriage to Mirza Mohammad Bedar Bakht, purported to be the great-grandson of India’s last Mughal ruler.
His death in 1980 left her struggling to survive, and she has spent the past decade petitioning authorities to recognise her royal status and compensate her accordingly.

Sultana Begum lives in a slum near Kolkata, surviving on a meagre pension

“Can you imagine that the descendant of the emperors who built Taj Mahal now lives in desperate poverty?” the 68-year-old asked.
Sultana Begum has lodged a court case seeking recognition that she is rightful owner of the imposing 17th-century Red Fort, a sprawling and pockmarked castle in New Delhi that was once the seat of Mughal power.
“I hope the government will definitely give me justice,” she said. “When something belongs to someone, it should be returned.”
Her case, supported by sympathetic campaigners, rests on her claim that her late husband’s lineage can be traced to Bahadur Shah Zafar, the last emperor to reign.
By the time of Zafar’s coronation in 1837, the Mughal empire had shrunk to the capital’s boundaries, after the conquest of India by the commercial venture of British merchants known as the East India Company.
A massive rebellion two decades later — now hailed as India’s first war of independence — saw mutinous soldiers declare the now frail 82-year-old as the leader of their insurrection.
The emperor, who preferred penning poetry to waging war, knew the chaotic uprising was doomed and was a reluctant leader.
British forces surrounded Delhi within a month and ruthlessly crushed the revolt, executing all 10 of Zafar’s surviving sons despite the royal family’s surrender.
Zafar himself was exiled to neighbouring Myanmar, travelling under guard in a bullock cart, and died penniless in captivity five years later.
Many of the Red Fort’s buildings were demolished in the years after the uprising and the complex fell into disrepair before colonial authorities ordered its renovation at the turn of the 20th century.
It has since become a potent symbol of freedom from British rule.
India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted the national flag from the fort’s main gate to mark the first day of independence in August 1947, a solemn ritual now repeated annually by his successors.
Sultana Begum’s case hinges on the argument that India’s government is the illegal occupant of the property, which she says should have been passed down to her.
The Delhi High Court rejected her petition last week as a “gross waste of time” — but did not rule on whether her claim to imperial ancestry was legitimate.
Instead the court said her legal team had failed to justify why a similar case had not been brought by Zafar’s descendants in the 150 years since his exile.
Her lawyer Vivek More said the case would continue.
“She has decided to file a plea before a higher bench of the court challenging the order,” he said.
Sultana Begum has endured a precarious life, even before she was widowed and forced to move into the slum she now calls home.
Her husband — who she married in 1965 when she was just 14 — was 32 years her senior and earned some money as a soothsayer, but was unable to provide for their family.
“Poverty, fear and lack of resources pushed him to the brink,” she added.
She lives with one of her grandchildren in a small shack, sharing a kitchen with neighbours and washing at a communal tap down the street.
For some years she ran a small tea shop near her home but it was demolished to allow the widening of a road, and she now survives on a pension of 6,000 rupees per month.
But she has not given up hope that authorities will recognise her as the rightful beneficiary of India’s imperial legacy, and of the Red Fort.
“I hope that today, tomorrow or in 10 years, I will get what I’m entitled to,” she said.
“God willing, I will get it back... I’m certain justice will happen.”

8,King Salman urges Iran to end ‘negative’ behaviour,RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman urged arch-rival Iran on Thursday to end its “negative behaviour” in the...,"RIYADH: Saudi Arabia’s King Salman urged arch-rival Iran on Thursday to end its “negative behaviour” in the region, after Riyadh accused Tehran of aiding Yemeni rebels in launching deadly attacks on his country.
However, the monarch who turns 86 on Friday appeared to soften his hawkish tone towards the Islamic republic, after having urged world powers last year to take a “firm stance” against Tehran.
Salman, addressing the Shura, the top government advisory body, virtually for a second year in a row, spoke for less than four minutes.
He read slowly from a white piece of paper, pausing at times, in a speech broadcast three hours after its initial scheduled time. The official Saudi Press Agency later released the king’s full statement.
“We hope (Iran) changes its policy and negative behaviour in the region, and it heads towards dialogue and cooperation,” he said, according to the statement.
“We are following with great concern the Iranian regime’s destabilising policy to security and safety in the region.” Riyadh and Tehran have been bitter foes for decades, taking opposing sides in a range of regional conflicts, including in Yemen where Saudi Arabia leads a military coalition against Iran-backed Houthi rebels.
The two sides have held several rounds of talks since April aimed at improving relations.
King Salman, however, accused Iran of “establishing and supporting” sectarian and armed groups in the region.
“We are also following the Iranian regime’s support of the terrorist Houthi militia, which is prolonging the war in Yemen and exacerbating the humanitarian situation there, as well as threatening the security of the kingdom.” Yemen has been wracked by civil war since 2014 pitting the government — supported by the Saudi-led coalition — against the Houthis who control much of the country’s north, including the capital Sanaa.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed in what the United Nations describes as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, with over 80 percent of Yemen’s population dependent on aid. The coalition on Sunday accused Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah group of helping the Houthis launch missiles and drones at Saudi Arabia, where two people were killed last week.
Saudi Arabia has long accused Iran of supplying the Houthis with sophisticated weapons and its Hezbollah proxy of training the insurgents.
Tehran denies the charges, while Hezbollah has dismissed them as “ridiculous”.

9,Ashraf Ghani says he had no choice but to flee Kabul,Ex-Afghan president says he was told that his personal protection force was incapable of defending him.,"ISLAMABAD: Afghanistan’s former president said he had no choice but to abruptly leave Kabul as the Taliban closed in and denied an agreement was in the works for a peaceful takeover, disputing the accounts of former Afghan and US officials.
Former president Ashraf Ghani said in a BBC interview that aired on Thursday that an adviser gave him just minutes to decide to abandon the capital, Kabul. He also denied widespread accusations that he left Afghanistan with millions in stolen money.
Ghani’s sudden and secret departure on Aug 15 left the city rudderless as US and Nato forces were in the final stages of their chaotic withdrawal from the country after 20 years.
On the morning of that day, I had no inkling that by late afternoon I would be leaving, Ghani told BBC radio. His remarks conflicted with other accounts.

Ex-Afghan president says he was told that his personal protection force was incapable of defending him

Former President Hamid Karzai told The Associated Press in an interview earlier this month that Ghani’s departure scuttled the opportunity for government negotiators, including himself and peace council chairman Abdullah Abdullah, to reach an 11th-hour agreement with the Taliban, who had committed to staying outside the capital.
After calling the defence minister Bismillah Khan, the interior minister and police chief and discovering all had fled the capital, Karzai said he invited the Taliban into Kabul to protect the population so that “the country, the city, doesn’t fall into chaos and the unwanted elements who would probably loot the country, loot shops”.
But Ghani in his radio interview with British Gen Sir Nick Carter, former chief of defence staff, said he fled to prevent the destruction of Kabul, claiming two rival Taliban factions were bearing down on the city and were ready to enter and wage a bitter battle for control. There was no evidence about the entry of the rival Taliban factions Ghani referred to, however.
The erstwhile insurgents, who in the days prior to the push into Kabul had swept over much of the country as Afghan government forces melted away or surrendered, quickly took control of the palace. According to humanitarian aid workers, the Taliban moved to protect their compounds.
Still, the Taliban takeover was met with widespread fear and a deep longing by many to flee their desperately poor homeland despite billions of international money over the 20 years the US-backed governments had been in power.
In the BBC interview, Ghani denied widespread accusations that he left Afghanistan with a cache of stolen money. The US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction John Sopko has been tasked with investigating those allegations.
Successive Afghan governments, as well as independent foreign and Afghan contractors, have been accused of widespread corruption, with dozens of reports by Sopko documenting the most egregious incidents.
Washington has spent $146 billion on reconstruction in Afghanistan since the overthrow in 2001 of the Taliban. Yet even before the insurgents returned to power in August, the poverty level in Afghanistan was at 54 per cent.
Earlier this week, Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, an investigative reporting organisation with 150 journalists in more than 30 countries, listed Ghani among the world’s most corrupt leaders. Belarus President Aleksandr Lukashenko was named the most corrupt, with Ghani, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and former Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz among the finalists for the title of most corrupt.
After being told by his national security adviser Hamdullah Mohib that his personal protection force was not capable of defending him, Ghani said he decided to leave. Mohib, who was literally terrified, gave him just two minutes to decide whether to leave, Ghani said, insisting he was not sure where he would be taken even after he was on the helicopter getting ready to take off.
Ghani did not address the rapid and swift collapse of the Afghan military in the weeks leading up to the Taliban takeover, but he did blame an agreement the United States had signed with the Taliban in 2020 for the eventual collapse of his government. That agreement laid out conditions for the final withdrawal of the remaining US and Nato forces ending America’s longest war. It also provided for the release of 5,000 Taliban prisoners, which Ghani said strengthened the insurgent force.

10,US navy seizes heroin worth $4m in Arabian Sea,DUBAI: United States navy vessels seized 385 kilograms (849 pounds) of heroin in the Arabian Sea worth some $4...,"DUBAI: United States navy vessels seized 385 kilograms (849 pounds) of heroin in the Arabian Sea worth some $4 million, in a major bust by the international maritime operation in the region, officials said on Thursday.
The USS Tempest and USS Typhoon seized the drugs hidden aboard a stateless fishing vessel plying Mideast waters, the international task force said in a statement.
The Navy said the fishing vessel likely came from Iran. All nine crew members identified themselves as Iranian nationals, according to Cmdr. Timothy Hawkins, a spokesperson for the US Navy’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet.
He did not elaborate on who manufactured the drugs or their ultimate destination.
As the task force ramps up regional patrols, it has confiscated illegal drugs worth over $193 million during operations at sea this year more than the amount of drugs seized in the last four years combined, its statement said.
Heroin is trafficked to the Middle East and even Europe by land from Iran and Afghanistan through well-worn land routes in the Balkans, Southern Caucasus mountains or Saudi Arabia, according to last year’s UN Global Synthetic Drugs Assessment.
Smugglers from Iran have increasingly taken to sea to bring heroin into South Asia, the report added, with Iranian and Pakistani sailors often arrested near Sri Lanka.—AP
Iran’s porous 1,923 kilometre-long (1195 mile-long) eastern border with Afghanistan, the worlds largest producer of opium, has turned it into a key transit country for the illicit drug trade.
