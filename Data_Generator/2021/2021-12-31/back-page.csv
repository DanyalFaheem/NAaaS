0,Open hearing of PTI foreign funding case from Jan 4,ECP sets March 27 for next phase of KP LG polls.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will take up for hearing the foreign funding case against the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Jan 4.
The ECP has issued notices to PTI GM (Finance) Mohammad Arshad and the party’s s counsel Shah Khawar. Notices have also been issued to petitioner Akbar S. Babar and his counsel Ahmad Hassan Shah.
A scrutiny committee of the ECP constituted in March 2019 to audit foreign funds of the PTI had finally submitted its report to the commission on Nov 26, about six months after the last deadline it was given.
The PTI foreign funding case continues to linger since November 2014 when it was filed by Mr Babar, the party’s founding member.

ECP sets March 27 for next phase of KP LG polls

In his petition, Mr Babar alleged financial irregularities in the party’s accounts, including illegal sources of funding, concealment of bank accounts in the country and abroad, money laundering and use of private bank accounts of party employees as a front to receive illegal donations from the Middle East.
The ECP in January this year had said that its scrutiny committee enjoyed the power and status of a joint investigation team and could not hold an open hearing in the foreign funding case it was seized with.
“The committee will face difficulties in proceeding with the case if it happens,” the ECP said in a statement.
The statement came a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan proposed public hearing in the foreign funding case and said it should be aired live. “Foreign funding case proceedings should be aired live on TV so that everything is known to the general public,” the prime minister said while addressing a public gathering in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The ECP statement, however, said the commission would hold open hearings in the foreign funding case after receiving recommendations from the scrutiny committee, which would be shared with the parties.
In an order passed on April 14 this year, the ECP had directed its co­m­mittee to conclude scrutiny of the PTI’s foreign funding by the end of May.
In its order issued on a complaint filed by the petitioner against the scrutiny committee’s decision to keep the party’s financial documents secret, the ECP stated: “We are of the considered view at this stage we cannot pass any remarks/on the instant application because the matter is sub judice before the Scrutiny Committee and ultimately the matter would be decided by the Commission after hearing arguments of both parties and in the light of the available record.”
The ECP in its order reiterated the petitioner’s claim of access to all PTI accounts, stating: “The Commission vide order dated 30.05.2016 turned down/dismissed the respondent’s [PTI] applications seeking security, secrecy and sanctity of the Scrutiny Committee proceedings of the respondent’s funds and held that record being scrutinised is a public document, the copies whereof can be obtained by anyone.”
However, the ECP said: “We have informed the petitioner that ultimately the Scrutiny Committee will send its report along with all the records to the Commission and then we will have to decide the case of foreign funding. When the matter will come before the Commission, at that time all the parties can take copies or peruse documents.”
LG polls in KP
The ECP has deferred the second phase of local government elections in KP for over two months, setting March 27 as the new date for the exercise.
A three-member bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja heard the case. The provincial chief secretary appeared before the bench.
The chief secretary said that the KP government had requested the ECP to hold the first phase of LG elections in December 2021 and the second phase in May 2022.
The CEC however recalled that the provincial government had agreed that the second phase of the LG polls would be held before Ramazan.
“Since the month of Ramazan will begin from April 3 or 4, it will be too late if elections are held in May,” the CEC noted. To this, the secretary requested the commission to hold LG elections by the end of March 2022.
“The last Sunday of that month would fall on March 27,” the CEC said and set the same as the new date for the electoral exercise.
Earlier, the second phase of the LG polls was scheduled for January 16. The KP government has been pleading for deferment of the second phase citing inclement weather and snowfall as the reasons.
The PTI has suffered an embarrassing defeat in the first phase of LG polls in KP.

1,"PM Imran perturbed at non-enforcement of legal reforms, IHC told","When govt challenges any powerful segment of society for any illegality, they start threatening to topple it, says AGP.","ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan is perturbed at non-enforcement of legal reforms effectively for the past three years, revealed the principal law officer of the country before the Islamabad High Court on Thursday.
Attorney General (AGP) Khalid Jawed Khan appeared before the IHC during the hearing of petitions relating to land disputes between citizens and government entities dealing with real estate projects and non-implementation of the Police Order 2002.
When IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah pointed out the government’s inability to keep a check on land mafia, AGP Khan expressed helplessness to curb the mafia.
The attorney general said the government had launched crackdown on petrol, sugar and chicken mafias, but to no avail. When the government challenges any powerful segment of society for any illegality, they start threatening to topple it, he said, adding that the government is striving to provide relief to the common man and is serious in its endeavour.
Justice Minallah asked the interior secretary about real estate venture of government entities. “When one goes to the motorway, there is a huge billboard of Supreme Court Employees Cooperative Housing Society,” he said, pointing out that the interior ministry is also running the housing society.
Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqat said it was a cooperative society being managed by the employees of the interior ministry and the secretary had no nexus with this real estate project.
Justice Minallah snubbed him and said it was a glaring example of clash of interest. If the secretary had no nexus with this housing society, why didn’t he issue a public notice or proceeded against those using the name of the ministry without authorisation, he wondered.
The IHC chief justice named the Intelligence Bureau, the Federal Investigation Agency, the interior ministry and many others operating the real estate business and said that they, in connivance with police, encroached upon public land and the affected land owner ran from pillar to post to get compensation.
Justice Minallah asked Inspector General of Islamabad Ahsan Younas about implementation of the Police Order and lamented that the poorly trained officer knew nothing how to investigate crimes.
The court directed the interior secretary, the deputy commissioner and the ins­pector general of Islamabad to submit rep­orts on implementation of the Police Order and encroachment of hou­sing societies on private land and adjourned the hearing for four weeks.

2,"Six fighters, Indian soldier killed in occupied Kashmir: police","Officials say at least 380 fighters, nearly 100 civilians, and over 80 security personnel have been killed since Aug 2019.","SRINAGAR: Six suspected fighters and an Indian soldier were killed during two separate clashes in occupied Kashmir overnight, police said on Thursday, rounding off another bloody year in the disputed territory.
Police said the six fighters killed in two villages belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammad.
A police statement issued on Thursday said one of the four Indian security personnel wounded in the clashes died of bullet injuries in a hospital.
Officials say that at least 380 fighters, nearly 100 civilians, and over 80 security personnel have been killed in the disputed region since August 2019.
That was when New Delhi revoked the region’s limited autonomy and brought it under direct rule, adding to anger among locals and galvanising support for self-determination.
Local police chief Vijay Kumar told the Economic Times daily this week that some 70 per cent of the youths who joined militant ranks this year “were either killed or arrested”.
Most of those arrested are being held under anti-terrorism legislation called the Unlawful Activities Prev­e­ntion Act (UAPA). The law allows people to be held for six months — often rolled over — without being charged and bail is virtually impossible.
One of those — in custody since November — is Khurram Parvez, programme coordinator for a respected rights group, the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society.
On December 1 the UN Human Rights Office criticised his arrest and said that the UAPA “raises serious concerns relating to the right of presumption of innocence along with other due process and fair trial rights”.
