0,PSX proposes amendments to GEM regulations,Investor’s self-declaration will be ‘sufficient’ as verifiable means to trade shares on GEM board.,"KARACHI: Responding to the concerns raised by stockbrokers, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has proposed amendments to the regulations with respect to the definition of accredited individual investors and their eligibility to trade on the recently launched Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) board.
The GEM board is a separate counter reserved for up-and-coming companies carrying higher investment and liquidity risks than mature companies listed on the exchange’s main board. Two companies have so far been listed on the GEM board, although they have attracted low volumes since their public offerings towards the end of 2021. Brokers have attributed the subdued activity in these shares to the regulator’s requirement that only institutions or accredited individual investors with net assets of at least Rs5 million can trade on the GEM counter.
The PSX has proposed changes in regulations that’ll enable it to “notify the manner of determining the eligibility criteria” of an accredited individual investor. In simpler words, the proposed amendment means that investors’ self-declaration will be “sufficient” as a verifiable means to trade shares on the GEM board.
Speaking to Dawn before the PSX’s move to amend the regulation, Topline Securities CEO Mohammed Sohail had called for simplifying the process for check-marking an investor as an accredited one. “The procedure is tedious right now because brokers have to get an undertaking and proof of assets to ascertain an investor’s eligibility. The regulators should make the process less cumbersome,” he had said.

Investor’s self-declaration will be ‘sufficient’ as verifiable means to trade shares on GEM board

Similarly, brokers resented the fact that the existing regulations held them financially responsible for any “misdeclaration” by investors. The existing regulations require the broker to honour a transaction by an ineligible investor from its own account by rectifying the underlying trade.
However, the proposed changes say an ineligible investor who has subscribed to the shares of a GEM-listed company will be allowed a “one-time exit at his/her own risk, without any responsibility at [the] securities broker end”.
The PSX has also proposed an “additional definition” of accredited individual investors under which someone holding shares in their Central Depository Company account worth Rs5m or more at the time of self-declaration should be considered eligible to trade on the GEM counter.
The proposed changes seek to replace the eligibility requirement to have “net assets” of at least Rs5m with “total assets” of the same value. The change from “net” to “total” is supposed to ensure “ease of eligibility monitoring” by the brokers.
Comments on the proposed changes can be submitted to the PSX by Jan 6, the exchange said.

1,"Gas disruption caused urea shortage, Senate panel told",Committee insists on knowing who was responsible for keeping the urea plants shut between June and September.,"

ISLAMABAD: Senator Syed Muzafar Hussain Shah presides over a meeting of Senate Standing Committee on National Food Security and Research on Thursday.—APP

 
ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Thursday noted that the gas supply disruption to fertiliser plants during the June-September period had caused a shortage of 200,000 tonnes of urea.
Discussing the urea shortage, the Senate Standing Committee on National Food Security and Research also observed that the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet had decided that urea plants would remain operational from March to November. But the plants were non-operational between June 28 and Sept 16 denting the urea production by 200,000 tonnes.
“We are suffering today due to a shutdown of urea plants. Why has a responsibility yet not been fixed? Why have people in the Ministry of Petroleum not been held accountable?” asked committee chair Syed Muzafar Hussain Shah.
The committee observed that this lapse will result in urea hoarding, price hike and an artificial shortage. It insisted on knowing who was responsible for keeping the urea plants shut between June and September. However, the response from the Ministry of National Food Security and Research was that no responsibility had been affixed.
“The committee recommends that inquiry be held why urea plants were shut despite the decision taken by the ECC, which has resulted in a grave crisis in the agriculture sector leading to rising prices of urea, shortage, black marketing besides the adverse effects on yield of wheat,” said Mr Shah.
The committee was informed by the food security ministry that the matter of gas shortage was taken up on various forums to ensure the supply to urea plants.
It complained that due to the urea shortage the production of other crops such as cotton had also suffered. Many members of the committee complained non-availability of urea and wheat in their localities.
Another member drew the attention towards smuggling of urea to other countries where producers could fetch a much higher price than Rs1,767 per 50kg bag at home.
However, the ministry officials informed the committee that urea was short the world over, including India. China and Russia had stopped exporting urea. Pakistan was self-sufficient in the production of urea had the gas shortage not occurred.
According to the ministry officials, the prime minister presided over two meetings on the matter and directed an uninterrupted supply of gas to the industry. There were technicalities involved in the pressure of gas supplied to the plants.
In response to observations made regarding the smuggling of urea through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan into Afghanistan, officials from the ministry stated that the law enforcement agencies were monitoring borders to prevent urea from being smuggled outside Pakistan.
Expressing concern, the standing committee maintained that the highest priority should be given to the availability of gas to urea plants to avoid shortages in the future.

2,Petrol demand hits record 8.35m tonnes in FY21,"CNG closure, high bike sales and ineffective transport system are key factors.","KARACHI: Despite massive price hikes, petrol has emerged as one of the most consumed fuel in Pakistan as its demand hit an all-time high of 8.35 million tonnes in FY21 as compared to an unstable pattern of usage witnessed in other fuels in the last five years.
According to province-wise consumption of energy products from FY17 to FY21, prepared by Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC), total petrol consumption in FY17 was 6.6 million tonnes which soared to 7.4m tonnes in FY18, 7.6m tonnes in FY19, 7.45m tonnes in FY20 and the highest-ever 8.35m tonnes in FY21. There was a slight decline in FY20 due to a slowdown in the movement of people amid Covid-19 restrictions followed by a countrywide shutdown in April 2020.
Petrol demand continued to get a boost amid the long closure of compressed natural gas (CNG) outlets in the last few years, especially in winters, due to gas shortage. As a result, the CNG vehicles have been switched to petrol despite its rising prices.
The massive increase in sales of two- and three-wheelers in the last few years had also boosted the demand for petrol while an ineffective transport system forced people to buy motorcycles. Another reason for switching over to petrol had been the declining saving ratio in CNG owing to its rising prices.

CNG closure, high bike sales and ineffective transport system are key factors

Punjab consumed 5.3m tonnes of petrol in FY21 which was 4.4m tonnes in FY17. Sindh held the second spot with the usage of 1.8m tonnes from 1.4m tonnes in FY17. Demand for petrol in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan also soared to 827,894 tonnes and 221,054 tonnes in FY21, respectively, from 511,833 tonnes and 193,825 tonnes in FY17.
In high-speed diesel (HSD), the peak consumption of 9m tonnes was recorded in FY18 as compared to 8.5m tonnes in FY17 and after ups and downs in FY19 and FY20, the fiscal year 2020-21 ended with 7.8m tonnes of diesel. Punjab held the lion’s share of 4.8m tonnes in FY21, a fall of 12pc over 5.45m tonnes in FY17. Diesel demand in Sindh stood at 1.76m tonnes in 2020-21 as compared to 1.8m tonnes in FY17.
In KP and Balochistan, the consumption of diesel stood at 905,908 tonnes and 109,722 tonnes in FY21 as compared to 803,201 tonnes and 157,855 tonnes in FY17. Its demand in Azad Kashmir rose to 125,026 tonnes in FY21 from 122,567 tonnes in FY17.
Refineries being shut down
Furnace oil (FO) consumption improved to 3.23m tonnes in FY21 if compared with 2.368m tonnes in FY20 but these numbers are far lower than 9.6m tonnes in FY17, 7.4m tonnes in FY18 and 3.5m tonnes in FY19.
Dr Ilyas Fazil, former chief executive OCAC and ex-member (Oil) Ogra, said due to no/less consumption of the high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) by the power sector, the local refineries have been operating at 60 per cent or less of their capacity. “A refinery cannot safely operate below 60pc. As a result, three out of five refineries are shut down. The loss is being compounded by the fact that furnace oil stocks are causing a serious headache,” he added.
He said with higher consumption, the import of petrol has shot through the roof.
Mr Ilyas said solution is simple. Maximise local use of HSFO from the local refineries, allowing them to operate at full capacity and put an embargo on the import of furnace oil till stocks level dictate so. This would free up natural gas use from power production, allowing more availability of gas for domestic and export industries, he added.
The Covid-19 shutdowns had played havoc with the financial health of many international and domestic airlines. The usage of JP-1, commercial airline fuel, had witnessed a peak of 928,499 tonnes in FY18 as compared to 833,104 tonnes in FY17. However, in FY21, the countrywide JP-1 consumption plunged to an all-time low of 363,514 tonnes from 791,748 tonnes in FY19 and 550,835 tonnes in FY20, indicating an alarming slowdown in air traffic.
The consumption of JP-1 fuel in Sindh fell to 302,343 tonnes in FY21 against 656,030 tonnes in FY17, while in Punjab its demand plunged to 58,477 tonnes from 67,548 tonnes in FY17.
With zero kerosene consumption in Balochistan and FATA as per OCAC’s data, the country’s total usage stood at 70,211 tonnes in FY21. The highest kerosene of 120,958 tonnes was recorded in FY17 which continued dropping to 114,386 tonnes in FY18, 102,830 tonnes in FY19 and 88,939 tonnes in FY20.
During 5MFY22, total oil sales (petrol, diesel and furnace oil) rose by 17.6pc to 9.60m tonnes from 8.16m tonnes in the same period last fiscal year. Petrol, diesel and FO sales rose by 10.8pc, 19.8pc and 28.5pc to 3.81m tonnes, 3.74m tonnes and 1.78m tonnes in 5MFY22 from 3.44m tonnes, 3.12m tonnes and 1.38m tonnes in the same period last fiscal year.

4,Auto sector stakeholders fear slump in sales,Cloud of uncertainty over duration of changes.,"KARACHI: With no clarity whether decisions taken while making the mini-budget would end after the announcement of Federal Budget 2022-23 or stay in place till December 2022, auto sector stakeholders said an increase in taxes and duties on locally-assembled and imported vehicles will definitely bring booming auto sales under pressure.
The government has increased the federal excise duty (FED) on locally-made vehicles of 1,000-2,000cc to five per cent from 2.5pc, followed by a hike to 10pc from 5pc on more than 2,000cc. FED on locally-made double cabins vehicles had been raised from 7.5pc to 10pc. General sales tax (GST) on automobiles for engine capacity between 850cc and 1,000cc had been enhanced to 17pc from 12.5pc. FED on import vehicles of 1,000-1,799cc has been increased to 30pc from 25pc followed by a jump to 40pc from 30pc in more than 3,000cc.
Indus Motor Company (IMC) CEO Ali Asghar Jamali said that it was unclear whether the duration of the measures taken in the mini budget would last till the announcement of Budget FY23 or these would continue post-budget.
“I anticipate a drop of 10-15pc in the sales of locally-assembled vehicles in case tax changes are made till the new budget announcement,” he said.

Cloud of uncertainty over duration of changes

Mr Jamali projected a fall of 20-25pc in case the tax changes would remain applicable after Budget FY23.
“The most important point is the confidence of investors in future in the light of decision taken in the mini budget for the auto sector,” he said.
IMC had announced millions of dollar investment besides investing in local production of hybrid vehicles but everything has changed within 100 days, he added.
Head of Research Pak Kuwait Investment Company Samiullah Tariq opined that automobiles would certainly become costlier. However, vehicles sales may not be hit hard as consumers had already been facing three to seven months times in getting delivery of locally-assembled cars, SUVs and Jeeps which had been earlier, he added.
He said steps taken in the mini budget appear in line with the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) decision to compress the sales of automobiles through auto financing by the banks.
Head of Research Ismail Iqbal Securities Fahad Rauf said sales would definitely drop but the second quarter of 2022 would give the real picture of impact of both the mini budget and the SBP’s decision to control auto financing.
He said currently auto sales had not shown any big upset in the last five months despite increase in the prices of vehicles.
In the last week of September, the SBP had slashed the maximum tenure of auto financing from seven years to five years besides increasing down payment for auto financing to 30pc from 15pc and reduction in maximum tenure for a personal loan from five years to four years.
Maximum debt-burden ratio allowed to a borrower had been decreased from 50pc to 40pc while the overall auto financing limits availed by one person from all banks/DFIs, in aggregate, would not exceed Rs3m, at any point in time. SBP’s prudential regulation for consumer financing is not applicable on locally-manufactured cars below 1,000cc and locally-manufactured electric vehicles.
An analyst at Insight Research said that Indus Motor Company (IMC) and Honda Atlas Cars Limited (HACL) would be most impacted by the proposed increased in duties, since all their cars are above 1,000cc.
Furthermore, increase in FED and GST would result in higher vehicle prices thus affecting volumetric sales. He said Toyota Hilux and Fortuner may see the highest price increase as FED on cars above 2,000cc increased twofold. On the flipside, he added this proposal has no material impact on Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL) as most of its vehicles are under 1,000cc, where no FED is levied.
The government had reduced FED across the board on locally-manufactured vehicles in June.
However, the government has now increased the FED on different engine capacities to ease pressure on import bill, he said.
