ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin presented in the National Assembly on Thursday the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021 envisaging withdrawal of sales tax exemptions worth Rs343 billion on machinery, pharma and imported food items.
The bill also proposes an increase in rates of federal excise duty, income tax and sales tax on services in the federal capital territory.
Mr Tarin explained that sales tax on machinery and pharma sector is adjustable and refundable. He said the levy of 17 per cent sales tax on several hundred items, which would directly or indirectly affect the people, would raise around Rs71bn for the national kitty.
The withdrawal of tax exemptions includes Rs31bn on luxury goods and Rs31bn on business goods.

“Elites, not the common man, are beneficiary of these exemptions,” Mr Tarin said, adding that tax exemptions of Rs343bn had been benefiting various interest groups for the past 70 years. “We have targeted only those items which are used by the elites.”
However, Mr Tarin said the levy of 17pc sales tax on some specific items would raise Rs2bn, adding that the tax on these items would only affect the ordinary people. “We have only increased the cost of imported luxury items,” he said, adding that local supply of most items remained unchanged.
The minister explained that withdrawal of tax exemptions worth Rs112bn on machinery and Rs160bn on pharmaceutical sector is adjustable and refundable. He did not consider these as taxes which will now be collected at the rate of 17pc on import of machinery and from the pharma sector.
The bill proposes 17pc sales tax on a number of items which were earlier exempted from the tax. The government terms these products luxury items which include import of live animals, steak meat, fish, vegetables, high-end bakery items, branded cheese, imported sausages, high-end cellphones and import bicycles.
At the same time, a number of items is proposed in the bill for targeted subsidy to minimise the impact of 17pc sales tax. These include oilcake, animal feed, poultry feed, maize seed (for corn oil) and cottonseed (for oil mills). Other items that will now attract 17pc tax on import are magazines and fashion journals.
The targeted subsidy plan of Rs33bn has been proposed to protect any segment of population which may get affected even indirectly by the withdrawal of some exemptions, etc.
According to finance minister, the 17pc sales tax imposed on the items used by common people would yield only Rs2bn for the government. These items include personal computers, sewing machines, match boxes, iodised salt, red chili and contraceptives.
Tax exemption is retained on basic food items — import and supply of rice, wheat, meslin, and local supply of other grains. Exemptions continue on local supply of fruits, vegetables, beef, mutton, poultry, fish, eggs, sugarcane and beet sugar. Similarly, zero rating on milk and fat-filled milk is also retained.
The exemptions on vegetables and fruits from Afghanistan is also maintained. Education text books, stationary items and locally manufactured laptops and personal computers will remain exempted from sales tax.
In the agriculture sector, the reduced rate of 2pc on fertiliser at out-stage will continue, along with multiple reduced rates on fertiliser inputs as currently available. The sales tax exemption will continue on pesticide and tractors will continue to be sold at 5pc tax rate.
Federal excise duty on imported and locally manufactured/assembled vehicles is proposed to be increased on the recommendations of the Tariff Policy Board and the Ministry of Commerce. Advance tax on cellular services is proposed to be increased from 10pc to 15pc, while withholding tax is proposed on foreign produced TV serial/dramas and advertisements with foreign actors.
Tax on transfer of newly purchased vehicles has been increased to discourage the practice of own-money. Exemptions available to REIT have been extended to special purpose vehicles set up under a REIT.
Pharmaceutical firms have been equated with exporters for purposes of release of refunds within 72 hours. Therefore, pharma firms will now be able to claim refunds on GST paid as input tax on packaging material, utilities, etc., which they previously could not — having price tag of Rs35bn.
Expectedly, the prices of medicines in the retail market should come down, approximately by 20pc.
The finance minister in a briefing to the media said those crating a hue and cry over the supplementary finance bill and the State Bank Pakistan (SBP) autonomy bill were only politicising the technical matter without any rationale. He also highlighted the importance of the SBP autonomy and said it was essential for the overall growth of country’s economy.
The minister said the allegations being levelled against the government were baseless because not every suggestion of the IMF had been accepted in the SBP autonomy bill. “We need to understand that all those countries, which have not granted independence to their central banks, like Turkey, have suffered.”
Mr Tarin clarified that there were no constitutional amendments in the SBP autonomy bill and it had been approved with a simple majority only. “If we feel that the State Bank is getting out of hand, a simple majority is required to finish these amendments.”
He said the main purpose of granting autonomy to the State Bank was to end government borrowings and claimed that the incumbent government had not borrowed anything from the central bank over the past two-and-a-half years. “Besides, there will be an SBP board appointed by the government to make key decisions, while the State Bank will be answerable to the standing committees of parliament, too,” the minister said.

• Finance supplementary bill to be debated
• SBP bill referred to committee
• Speaker allows extension in life of six expired ordinances
ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday finally tabled two controversial legislations required to meet conditions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the National Assembly amid noisy protest by a `confused’ opposition whose members attended the sitting without their senior leaders and apparently with no clear strategy.
The opposition members carrying placards started gathering in front of the speaker’s dais as soon as Speaker Asad Qaiser invited Finance Minister Shaukat Tarin to introduce the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021 seeking to amend certain laws on taxes and duties — also known as the mini-budget — and the State Bank of Pakistan (Amendment) Bill 2021.
The speaker declared that the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021 would not be referred to the standing committee and it would be debated in the house whereas he sent the bill seeking to provide “operational and financial autonomy” to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to the concerned house committee for a report.
The approval of the bills is necessary to ensure Pakistan’s sixth review of $6 billion Extended Fund Facility gets cleared by the IMF’s Executive Board which is scheduled to meet on Jan 12 to decide about the disbursement of about $1bn tranche.
The opposition members, who had earlier announced that they would block the government’s move to present the bills with full force, in their speeches accused the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) of surrendering the country’s economic sovereignty through these bills. They said the bills would cause more economic difficulties for the people of Pakistan who were already reeling under unprecedented price hike and unemployment.
Though the joint opposition after a meeting on Wednesday had announced that it had directed the members to ensure their attendance on the fateful day, neither Opposition Leader Shehbaz Sharif nor PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari attended the sitting.
Besides agitating over the presentation of the two controversial bills, the opposition members also protested over the government’s move to get extension in the life of six expired ordinances. The speaker, however, through a ruling dismissed the opposition’s objections and allowed the government to move resolutions seeking extension in the constitutional life of the ordinances with retrospective effect.
At one stage, the opposition members, including senior lawmakers Syed Naveed Qamar of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Murtaza Javed Abbasi of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), rushed towards the front treasury bench and were seen exchanging arguments with federal ministers, including Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Shaukat Tarin, Asad Umar, Fawad Chaudhry and Dr Shireen Mazari, when Adviser to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan was presenting the resolutions for extension of the ordinances.
“You are an IMF agent. You are a traitor,” said minority PML-N member Kesoo Mal Kheeal Das while pointing finger at the finance minister’s face. However, Mr Tarin remained seated and gestured him to go away.
The opposition members tore apart the copies of the bills and the agenda and threw the pieces in the air and on the speaker and the treasury benches while raising slogans of “Go Niazi Go”, “Down with Traitors” and “Say No to Mini-Budget.”
Some opposition members staged a sit-in in front of the speaker’s dais for a brief time. Some treasury backbenchers, including women, rushed towards the protesting opposition members and the house witnessed a scuffle among the women members.
The opposition at one point challenged the speaker’s ruling on a voice vote on a resolution for extension of an ordinance, but interestingly its members did not stand up to register their vote when the speaker ordered those members to rise on their seats who were against the resolution. Later, amid desk-thumping by the treasury members, the speaker declared that 145 members had voted in favour of the resolution whereas only three votes had been polled against it.
After facilitating the government in completing its task of tabling the bills and the resolutions for extension of ordinances, the speaker allowed the opposition members to deliver their rhetoric speeches in which they slammed the government’s economic policies and asked it to withdraw the controversial legislations.
Taking the floor first, PML-N parliamentary leader Khawaja Asif not only targeted the government, but also lashed out at the speaker over his alleged partisan role.
“This is a day of infamy for the parliament and the speaker’s chair. The history will remember this day when the whole nation is feeling ashamed due to the parliament’s behaviour,” said the PML-N firebrand member.
“For God sake, have mercy on Pakistani nation. Don’t sell Pakistan,” he said, alleging that the PTI government had made Pakistan a colony of international donors.
He alleged that the government was handing over the control of the SBP to the IMF, adding that it seemed that the East India Company was ruling the country.
The PML-N lawmaker alleged that the government had been forced to present the mini-budget because of the corruption and loot during the three-year term of the PTI government.
“Had you (the government) not allowed the loot in medicines, sugar and wheat, you would not have been imposing new taxes and presenting the mini-budget,” he said.
Mr Asif termed the speaker’s ruling about the extension of ordinances “illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court’s verdict”.
“Surrendering Pakistan’s economic sovereignty is more dangerous than that of the fall of Dhaka,” he said while referring to the East Pakistan debacle on December 16, 1971.
In response to Mr Asif’s speech, Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar said the PTI government had approved more development budget as compared to the previous governments. Taking the opposition to task for criticising the government on the National Security Policy,
Mr Umar said during the previous government’s era, the prime minister and the defence minister were working on foreign “Iqama”. He said in the last survey, 86 per cent Pakistanis had opined that the PTI government had performed well during the Covid-19 pandemic.
The PPP’s Raja Pervez Ashraf said Mr Umar had not responded to the concerns and points raised by the opposition about the controversial bills and instead had delivered a political speech. He said the government members were not able even to visit their constituencies. He said the people would teach a lesson to the treasury members when they would go to them to seek vote.
Asad Mehmood of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam said the PTI had faced a defeat in local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa despite being the ruling party, adding that the party would face the same fate in every upcoming election.
Responding to the opposition’s criticism, the speaker said the house would hold a debate on the finance (supplementary) bill and the amendments, if moved by the opposition.
The speaker then gave floor to Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, but the PML-N’s Barjees Tahir pointed out lack of quorum. The speaker adjourned the sitting till Friday morning (today) even without ordering a headcount as quorum was visibly lacking.

2,"Covid jab centres to stay shut on Jan 1-2, says NCOC",Thirty per cent of the country's total population has been vaccinated.,"ISLAMABAD: While 30pc of overall and 46pc of eligible population has been vaccinated against Covid-19, the National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) on Thursday decided to keep vaccination centres closed on the first two days of the next year.
“All vaccination centres across the country will remain closed on 1st and 2nd January 2022 (Saturday and Sunday) as vaccination staff remained extensively engaged in achieving national targets for the year 2021. Vaccination campaign will resume from 3rd January onwards,” the NCOC announced.
“30pc of country’s total population and 46pc of eligible population stand vaccinated! In the wake of rising threat of Omicron, please get yourself fully vaccinated and follow SOPs! Wear mask, avoid crowded places and ensure social distancing!” it tweeted.

 



 
Meanwhile, the country recorded the highest number of cases over the last almost two months and over 400 cases after a gap of around one month. The data centre showed that as many as 482 cases and three deaths were reported over the past 24 hours. Earlier over 400 cases were reported on Dec 3. More than 482 cases were reported on Nov 10 when 637 people were infected.
PMA blasts tax hike on medicines
In a related development, the Pakistan Medical Asso­ci­a­tion (PMA) expre­ssed concern over the federal government’s proposed 17 per cent GST on raw materials for pharmaceutical products.
“This imposition of 17pc GST on raw materials will cause the price hike of medicine which is already very high and out of the reach of the poor people of the country and even the middle class of our society feels burdened. This move will make it difficult for the poor people to get treatment for their sick family members. We str­o­ngly oppose this propo­sal. Unfortunately, the present government has alre­ady increased the drug prices 11 times during its tenure.
“In such conditions when there is scarcity of health facilities at public hospitals, this increase in prices of medicines will add to the misery of the people,” it stated.
PMA Secretary General Dr Qaisar Sajjad said that the association had been demanding for the last many years to increase the health budget up to the 6pc of the Gross Domestic Product so that the people could get treatment of their diseases.
“We suggest the government to make public health facilities free in 2022, so that nobody dies without treatment. According to reports published in a section of media, the government will impose 17pc GST on food items including infants’ milk in upcoming mini-budget. These food items are very important for balanced diet and increasing the price of food items will not only increase the burden of diseases, but will also increase the mal-nutrition and stunting.
“We are surprised that even knowing the fact that our children are already facing malnutrition and stunting, the government is prepared to increase the prices of essential food items.
“The PMA demands from the federal government to review its decision and withdraw the proposal of imposing 17pc GST on food items and raw materials for pharmaceutical products to stop the further increase of drug prices to ease difficulties of the poor people who are already suffering from the inflation and bad economic situation in the country,” he said.
