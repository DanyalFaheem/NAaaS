0,Teachers give govt 10 days to withdraw decision of placing schools under Islamabad mayor,"Say if section 166 is not removed from ordinance, educational activities in capital will be suspended from Jan 10.","ISLAMABAD: Teaching and non-teaching staff of Federal Directorate of Education (FDE)-run schools on Thursday gave a deadline of 10 days to the government for making an amendment to the local government ordinance otherwise educational activities will be suspended from January 10 for an indefinite period.
On the other hand, thousands of CDA employees are also protesting against the ordinance.
However, Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) Ali Nawaz Awan told Dawn on Thursday that the ordinance was not a final document rather when it would be placed before parliament for becoming an Act all legitimate concerns of the teachers, employees of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and others would be removed.
Addressing a press conference, representatives of the action committee headed by Fazal-i-Mola said teachers through their protest and one week’s boycott of classes had attempted to make the government realise that clause 166 of Local Government Ordinance 2021 was not acceptable to the employees of educational institutions.

Say if section 166 is not removed from ordinance, educational activities in capital will be suspended from Jan 10

However, he said, the government and its ministers were still unmoved.
“Therefore, 10 days are being given to the government to remove section 166 from the ordinance otherwise all schools will be closed from January 10.”
Under section 166, the director general of the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) will report to the mayor, meaning the FDE will be devolved to the local government.
The FDE employees have been expressing concern over the move, stating that running the FDE which required around Rs20 billion annually was beyond the capacity of the local government, fearing that the municipal corporation will ultimately go for privatising the schools.
Recently, the issue was also highlighted in the Senate where the opposition rejected it and termed it uncalled for. Like the FDE teachers,over 14,000 employees of the CDA are also opposing the devolution of the civic agency’s departments along with their employees to the local government.
The CDA employees recently staged a massive protest demonstration against the ordinance.
According to the ordinance, besides FDE, all directorates of the CDA except for the chairman secretariat and planning and estate wings will be devolved to the municipal corporation along with staff.
Speaking to Dawn, Mr Awan said instead of announcing boycott of classes the teachers should submit proposals. Their legitimate concerns will be removed when the ordinance will be placed before the parliament.
He said life of the ordinance was 120 days and the government will place it in parliament to make it an Act and local government elections will be held on the basis of the Act, not the ordinance.
He said the FDE will remain part of the ministry of education which will continue dealing with the affairs of its employees, budget and finances.
The SAPM said the mayor will play a role of oversight in greater interest of 2.2 million people of the city. “Things are already cleared but while approving the Act we will make it clearer,” he said.
When asked about the protest of CDA employees, he said the union’s secretary general met him and it was decided that the union will give its suggestions in writing.
“We will incorporate their legitimate proposals in the Act,” the SAPM said.
Speaking to Dawn, CDA Employees’ Union Secretary General Chauhdry Yaseen said the SAPM “assured us that our suggestions will be incorporated in the Act.” He said the CDA employees demanded immediate removal of ordinance.
“We will continue holding dialogues with the government representatives and fighting for our rights in courts and streets,” he said, adding the bad experience of the last local government was still haunting residents of Islamabad.
“CDA is a national organisation and we will not allow its division. Secondly, the performance of CDA speaks for itself. During the five-year tenure of the local government, roads, streets, pavement, markets etc., presented a bad and dilapidated look. But within a few months after getting control of some departments, the CDA through a number of development projects changed the shape of the city,” said Mr Yaseen.

4,DHR warns of sit-in from Jan 31 if govt fails to recover missing persons,ISLAMABAD: The Defence of Human Rights (DHR) on Thursday said all efforts made for the recovery of missing persons...,"ISLAMABAD: The Defence of Human Rights (DHR) on Thursday said all efforts made for the recovery of missing persons have failed.
It appealed to the prime minister, the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the army chief to address the issue otherwise a sit-in will be held in Islamabad from Jan 31.
Speaking at a press conference at the National Press Club, DHR chief Amina Masood Janjua said 32 people disappeared in 2021, out of which 12 were released and five others traced.
Advocates Imaan Hazir Mazari, retired Col Inamur Rahim, Raja Mushtaq and Omer Sohail were also present.
“Despite our problems, the new year brings new hopes for the return of our loved ones. Human rights defenders as well as families will continue their struggle and we demand that the government must take steps to resolve the burning issue of the disappeared as a top priority now,” she said.
“The outgoing year was more challenging than the previous ones as the victim families took their struggles to different high courts.
“The hopelessness derived from the commission led the victim families, human rights organisations to plead their cases in the courts.
“DHR alone filed over 20 cases of enforced disappearance in different high courts in 2021,” she said.
She alleged that the government had suppressed the voice of families.
“Whenever we tried to release a video regarding enforced disappearances or held an exhibition of books the premises were sealed which is a proof that there is a martial law regarding the issue of missing persons.
Moreover, a new law regarding missing persons will create problems for the families of missing persons rather than those who were involved in the heinous crime.
I myself presented recommendations regarding missing persons to Prime Minister Imran Khan and Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari but no development was observed,” she said.
Ms Janjua alleged that the National Commission on Human Rights was not cooperating with the families of missing persons.
“Political leaders while in the opposition assure us that they will speak about the issue but after coming to power they forget their promise.
“Now we are left with the only option to hold a sit-in. We have become fed up because no one is ready to listen to us and we warn that our sit-in can become a matter of embarrassment for Pakistan,” she said.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Rahim said cases of 8,000 missing persons were filed with the commission till Nov 30.
“It is unfortunate that when I started raising voice I myself became a missing person.
“The law regarding enforced disappearances was nothing but an eyewash. We demand that former Supreme Court judge Dost Mohammad should be appointed as head of the commission on enforced disappearances,” he said.

5,"Senate body terms transfers, postings in PARC unfair",ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Thursday expressed displeasure over transfers and postings in Pakistan...,"ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Thursday expressed displeasure over transfers and postings in Pakistan Agriculture Research Council terming them unfair.
The Senate Standing Committee on National Food Security and Research took up the matter after the chairman of the committee Syed Muzafar Hussain Shah said that he had received complaints that acting chairman of Pakistan Agriculture Research Council had transferred senior most officials without following merit.
Members of committee also showed displeasure over publishing of advertisements regarding vacancies in PARC in newspapers which they said also against the instructions of the committee.
It was asserted that in addition to English and Urdu, advertisements must be published in regional dailies as well.
“We will look into the matter whether the acting chairman has made transfers in a transparent manner,” said chairman of the committee Syed Muzafar Hussain Shah.
The meeting observed that acting PARC chairman, Ghulam Ali, who took charge in October, had made 28 transfers since then.
Members expressed displeasure that an official of Grade 19 was promoted as Director General while senior qualified Grade 21 officers were sitting on the sidelines. Acting PARC chairman, who was also present on the occasion, said officials were unwilling to take on responsibilities of DG, while two others were close to being retired.
His response did not sit well with the members of the committee, who wondered if the acting chairman had the powers to make transfers.
Reviewing the list presented PARC regarding the vacant positions, the committee directed that details of marks obtained, interview committee, shortlisted candidates and grade wise postings be submitted to the committee.
The meeting expressed that irregular postings affected the functioning of Pakistan’s leading agriculture research facility.
Meanwhile, discussing the measures taken to fix a uniform support price for wheat in Pakistan, the committee stressed the need for formulating a mechanism to ensure that provinces follow the price.
The committee was of the view that this was the second year that the problem of wheat prices had arisen. It was recommended that a committee be formed comprising representatives from the Federal Government and the provinces and jointly fix a common uniform support price for wheat before commencement of the sowing season.

8,Increase seen in cost of three development projects,Officials say govt’s revision of materials’ rate is the reason,"RAWALPINDI: While admitting that inflation in the province has skyrocketed, the government revised market rates of material because of which the cost of three main development projects increased by 20 to 25 percent.
These projects are: remodelling of Katcheri Chowk, Rawalpindi Ring Road and Leh Expressway and Flood Channel.
Earlier, PC-I of the first project was approved at Rs3.7 billion and now it is likely to increase by over Rs4 billion. Rawalpindi Ring Road project’s construction cost was estimated at Rs23 billion but now it will increase to Rs27 billion. Similarly, the cost of Leh Nullah project, worth Rs105 billion will increase to Rs110 billion.
A senior official of RDA told Dawn that the prices of construction material including iron, cement, bitumen, pipes and other materials had been increased many fold so that departments could increase rates of the contractors and the tendering process could begin.

Officials say govt’s revision of materials’ rate is the reason

He said if these projects started this year, the project cost would not escalate, adding however that the cost could increase if these projects were not launched by end of this fiscal year.
The government approved remodelling of Katcheri chowk as this would put an end to traffic congestion on the main square of Rawalpindi.
A total of Rs3.7 billion was allocated for this in the Annual Development Programme (ADP) for 2021-22. He said the government also allocated the same amount for remodelling of Defence Chowk in front of Defence Housing Authority Phase-I and Shifa Eye hospital.
However, he said that the civic body recommended to the provincial government, to begin remodelling of Katcheri Chowk first because the problem of traffic congestion would increase if both projects started at the same time.
He added that both squares are on Jhelum Road. “The garrison authorities also asked the civic body to start work on Katcheri Chowk otherwise, the movement towards General Headquarters (GHQ) of army from Airport and Garrison Headquarter on Ammar Chowk will be affected”, he said.
When contacted, RDA Chairman Tariq Mehmood Murtaza said that the government would begin work on the project as it was important to solve the problem of traffic congestion on the main square.
“Yes, we are working to revise the PC-I as the provincial government revised the market rates of the construction material. The PC-I will be approved in January and soon after, the tendering process will be started. The project is likely to start in a month or two”, he said, adding construction of a two-storey flyover at Katcheri Chowk will begin in 2022, after which, development work on the Defence Chowk project will also begin.
The flyover’s design is one of a kind, he said.

This was pointed out by Punjab Governor Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar on Thursday.
“The present government is using all its resources to make the country economically strong”, he said, adding Punjab Aab-e-Pak Authority is working hard towards providing clean drinking water to people.
He said this while talking to journalists after inaugurating water filtration plants in Gujar Khan in collaboration with Muslim Hands. Chairman of the authority Dr Shakeel Ahmed was also present.
Mr Sarwar said Pakistan is currently facing many challenges for which it is imperative that all political and religious parties put national interest first and think towards development and prosperity of its people.
“There is no shortage of talent and resources in Pakistan, only that everyone needs to work together. Opposition parties should support government initiatives such as strengthening the country economically”, he said, adding Pakistan must be economically strong.
“The steps taken by the present government under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan for economic growth and stability are exemplary. There is no doubt that overseas Pakistanis, who send billions of dollars in foreign exchange annually to Pakistan also play a vital role in the country’s economic development and prosperity.
“Overseas Pakistanis are the capital of the country and the PTI government stands by them”, he added.
He said he was glad that philanthropists and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) had joined him in the struggle to provide people clean drinking water to people. More than 1,500 projects of Punjab Aab-i-Pak Authority are in the final stages of completion which will be inaugurated in the coming year. “Our first priority is to provide clean drinking water to every citizen and villager across Punjab without any political discrimination”, he added.
