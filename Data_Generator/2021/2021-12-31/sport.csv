The Ivorians said players arriving from Europe at their training camp in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, had tested positive and been put into quarantine by local authorities.
They did not name the players nor state how long they will have to isolate but the rest of the squad would continue with their training, a team statement on Thursday added.
Ivory Coast have been preparing in Saudi Arabia since Monday and are due to stay until Jan 5, before heading to Cameroon, where they will compete in Group ‘E’ against Algeria, Equatorial Guinea and Sierra Leone.
Algeria earlier this week said forwards Youcef Belaili and defenders Mohamed Amine Tougai and Houcine Benyada had tested positive at their training camp in Qatar.
They will have to  “observe the period of quarantine required by sanitary protocols before re-joining the squad,” said the Algerian federation.
On Thursday, Spanish club Barcelona said their Moroccan player Abdessamad Ezzalzouli had also tested positive, putting his participation at the finals in doubt.
Ezzalzouli is only expected to arrive at Morocco’s pre-tournament training camp next week.
All players called up for the Cup of Nations but whose clubs are playing this weekend are allowed to stay at the clubs until Monday in a concession announced last week by the Confederation of African Football.Usually, players must be released by their clubs to their respective national teams 14 days before the start of the tournament.

Atletico said Simeone and 2018 World Cup-winner Griezmann were asymptomatic and isolating along with captain Koke, midfielder Hector Herrera and forward Joao Felix. 
“All of them are asymptomatic and isolating at their respective homes, in strict compliance with the health authorities’ guidelines,” Atletico said in a statement. 
Atletico, fifth in LaLiga on 29 points after 18 games, host Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. 
Barca said midfielder Philippe Coutinho, defender Sergino Dest and winger Ez Abde were the latest players to return positive tests. 
The Catalans had already been hit by a number of Covid-19 cases in their squad, with Ousmane Dembele, Samuel Umtiti and Gavi set to miss Sunday’s LaLiga trip to Real Mallorca after testing positive. 
Clement Lenglet, Dani Alves, Jordi Alba and Alejandro Balde also returned positive tests this week. 
“Footballers Sergino Dest, Coutinho and Abde Ezzalzouli have tested positive for Covid-19. The players are in good health and self-isolating at home. The club has reported the cases to the relevant authorities,” Barcelona said in a statement. 
Barca, who last played in the league in a 1-1 draw at Sevilla on Dec 21, are seventh on 28 points from 18 games. They are also depleted by injuries going into Sunday’s match at Mallorca. 
Real Madrid are also dealing with a Covid-19 outbreak in their squad with Thibaut Courtois, Federico Valverde, Eduardo Camavinga, Vinicius Jr returning positive tests on Wednesday. 
Luka Modric, Rodrygo, Marco Asensio, Gareth Bale, Marcelo, Andriy Lunin, Isco and David Alaba also tested positive earlier this month. 
During the break, Dest and Vinicius had posted photos on Instagram of their respective trips to Miami. They included court-side photos at a Miami Heat basketball game and pictures with star Jimmy Butler. Vinicius’ account included one of him with Heat guard Tyler Herro. They all wore masks in the photos. 
On Wednesday, the Heat were unable to meet the NBAs requirement of eight available players for the game against San Antonio, leading to it being postponed. Miami had 12 players listed as out because of a combination of injuries and positive virus tests.

6,India make ‘perfect start’ to series with victory over SA,CENTURION: India completed a convincing 113-run win on the fifth day of the first Test against South Africa at the...,"CENTURION: India completed a convincing 113-run win on the fifth day of the first Test against South Africa at the SuperSport Park in Centurion on Thursday to make a  “perfect start” to the series.
Resuming on 94 for four in a chase of 305 to win, South Africa were bowled out for 191, losing their last three wickets in the first two overs after lunch.
Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami took three wickets each. Fellow fast bowler Mohammed Siraj claimed two wickets and off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin dismissed the last two batsmen off successive deliveries.
The win gave India a 1-0 lead in the three-match World Test Championship series and boosted their chances of winning a series in South Africa for the first time.
“We got off to the perfect start,” said Indian captain Virat Kohli.

“Getting a result in four days [the second day was lost to rain] shows how well we played this Test match and how motivated and keen we were to start off in the manner we did.”
There was early resistance from South African captain Dean Elgar and Temba Bavuma, with Elgar surviving a caught and bowled chance to Shami when he was on 63.
Bumrah switched to bowling around the wicket and trapped Elgar leg before wicket for 77 when the batter played around a delivery angled into his stumps.
Siraj ended an aggressive innings of 21 by Quinton de Kock when the batter edged an attempted drive into his stumps and Shami had Wiaan Mulder caught behind with a ball which moved just enough off the seam to take the outside edge of the bat.
Marco Jansen was caught behind off Shami in the first over after lunch before Ashwin wrapped up the innings, leaving Bavuma, South Africa’s top-scorer in the first innings with 52, stranded on 35.
“You need runs to compete,” said Elgar of South Africa’s first innings of 197 in reply to India’s 327.
“The basics of the game still apply and we didn’t do them well from a batting point of view.”
India were in command from the first day, when KL Rahul’s century enabled them to reach 272 for three after winning the toss.
Kohli said playing at Centurion, where South Africa had won 21 out of 26 previous Test matches, was always difficult for visiting teams.
“We had to be absolutely clinical with the bat, the ball and in the field,” he said.
Kohli said a key factor was the discipline shown by India’s opening batters, Rahul and Mayank Agarwal, who put on 117 for the first wicket on the first day.
“Winning the toss and batting first in tough conditions overseas is always a tough challenge. A lot of credit has to go to Mayank and KL who set up this Test match for us.”
The entire second day was lost to rain and conditions proved more difficult for batters when play resumed on the third day, with fast bowlers of both sides exploiting indentations on the pitch which caused variable bounce.
Shami took five for 44 in the first innings to give India a crucial lead of 130 runs. He finished with match figures of eight for 107.
Meanwhile, Rahul said the victory in Centurion is a nice start for the tourists.
Right-handed Rahul says harsh lessons from past tours have meant the side are better prepared for this series.
“We sat down as a unit and discussed what were the mistakes we have done in the previous series and what it takes to be successful in South Africa. We have come here better prepared this time round.
“What we did brilliantly in this test match was that we stayed in the moment, we took it one session at a time and did not think about the pitch, weather or the result. We will continue to do that,” the batter said.
Rahul rated his century in the match as the best of his seven Test tons.
“It is right up there in terms of the conditions, the wicket and how challenging it was. It took a lot of guts, determination and discipline to get the century and put my team into a winning position,” he added.

7,Depleted  ATP Cup field provides glimpse  into future,"SYDNEY: The third edition of the team-based ATP Cup will kick off the new men’s tennis season on Saturday, its...","SYDNEY: The third edition of the team-based ATP Cup will kick off the new men’s tennis season on Saturday, its depleted field providing a taste of what the sport will look like without the ‘Big Three’ of Roger Federer, Rafa Nadal and Novak Djokovic.
For different reasons the trio, who are tied for a men’s record 20 major titles, will not be in action when the $10 million tournament, similar in format to the Davis Cup, is played in two venues at the Sydney Olympic Park.
Organisers did not cite any reason when they announced on Wednesday that top-ranked Djokovic has pulled out of the Serbia team, which won the inaugural edition in 2020.
While the 40-year-old Federer was ruled out after undergoing multiple knee surgeries, Spaniard Nadal has been recovering after testing positive for the novel coronavirus.
World number five Andrey Rublev, who was part of Russia’s title-winning side in this year’s edition, and 2020 US Open winner Dominic Thiem are other top names missing.
The withdrawal of Thiem, who is planning his return next month from a long-term wrist injury, and Dennis Novak saw Austria fail the eligibility criteria and they have been replaced by France in the tournament.
The third edition of the ATP Cup will have 16 nations, up from this year’s 12-team event but still behind the 24 sides that featured in its 2020 debut when Djokovic-led Serbia clinched the trophy.
“It’s never the same when you have No. 1 in your team and you don’t have him. It’s a big difference,” Dusan Lajovic, who will be Serbia’s top player in Djokovic’s absence, said on Thursday.
“Obviously when Novak is in the team the expectations get much higher. Right now maybe we are on the sideline a little bit, and it could be good for us, it could be bad, we’ll see. [But] Definitely different.”
In Djokovic’s absence, world number two Daniil Medvedev will be the top draw in Sydney and lead Russia’s title defence with runners-up Italy once again looking strong with two top-10 players in Matteo Berrettini and Jannik Sinner in their squad.
The tournament, which sees the 16 teams divided into four groups with the winners advancing to the semi-finals, will provide a form guide of the contenders for the Australian Open, which will begin at Melbourne Park from Jan 17.
With Federer, Nadal and Djokovic missing from the big-ticket event, it will also provide a glimpse into the future.
“I guess that’s how it is going to be generally in a few years’ time, potentially maybe in three years’ time,” said Greek world number four Stefanos Tsitsipas.
“So getting used to it earlier, it’s pretty much a new reality. Let’s see how tennis works out without the top three. I really want to see which players are going to prevail at this point.”
Meanwhile, Lajovic said Djokovic could still play at the Australian Open.
Djokovic has refused to confirm if he has  been inoculated against Covid-19, with all participants at the opening  Grand Slam of the year needing to be vaccinated or have a medical  exemption.
Lajovic said his team-mate wanted to be in Sydney.
“Unfortunately, he’s not able to come here, but, you know, he was I think hoping, same  as we did, that somehow he will be here. Unfortunately he’s not, and  we’ve got to deal with it,” he said. “I don’t know the official  reason. Maybe the ATP knows. He just said that he’s not coming to the  ATP and trying to get to the Australian Open.”
Pressed on whether  Djokovic would be at Melbourne Park, Lajovic said:  “I mean, the  decision, he said, ‘I’m not coming, guys,’ to the ATP Cup. We’ll see  about the Australian Open.“He didn’t specify if he’s coming or not but that he’s waiting for a decision.”

8,Pakistan crash against Sri Lanka in U-19 Asia Cup semi-final,"Having bowled out the Sri Lankans for 147, Pakistan could only manage 125 before being all out.","LAHORE: A dismal chase means Pakistan is no longer in the race for the Junior Asia Cup title. 
Having bowled out the Sri Lankans for 147, Pakistan could only manage 125 before being all out in the final over of a low-scoring semi-final in Dubai on Thursday. 
Sri Lanka will now face India for the title after the latter romped past Bangladesh by 103 runs in the other semi-final in Sharjah. Pakistan had won Pool ‘A’ while Bangladesh were the winners of Pool ‘B’. 
Spinners Treveen Mathwew (4-31) and Dunith Wellalage (3-31) did the damage against Pakistan, with six of their batters failing to reach double figures. 
Only top-order batter Mohammad Shahzad (30) and Ahmed Khan (36) lower down the order provided any semblance of resistance with Sri Lanka only conceding five extras in contrast to Pakistan’s 15. 
Earlier, pacers Zeeshan Zameer (4-32), Ahmed Khan (2-26) and Awais Ali (2-27) bowled splendidly for Pakistan as they reduced Sri Lanka to 70-8. 
But their last three batsmen got crucial runs with Yasiru Pathirana (31 not out) and Matheesha Pathirana (31) sharing a stand of 47 before Yasiru added another 30 with Treveen (12) to lift Sri Lanka to a total that proved beyond Pakistan’s reach.

9,Chris Silverwood to miss Sidney Cricket Ground Test after virus case in family,The touring party has now registered seven positive cases.,"SYDNEY: England’s beleaguered Ashes tour went from bad to worse on Thursday with under-pressure coach Chris Silverwood to miss the fourth Test in Sydney after a family member tested positive for the coronavirus.
Silverwood and his family have to isolate in Melbourne for 10 days while the rest of the team head to Sydney for the clash starting on Jan 5.
The touring party has now registered seven positive cases — three support staff and four family members — since a PCR testing regime was implemented on Monday after the virus was first detected during the Boxing Day Test.
“A fourth successive round of PCR tests will be administered today,” the England Cricket Board said in a statement, adding that the team would share a charter flight with Australia to Sydney on Friday.
Australian reports said England fast bowling coach Jon Lewis, spin coach Jeetan Patel and strength and conditioning boss Darren Veness were also believed to be in isolation.
Batting coach Graham Thorpe is expected to take over as head coach in the interim.
International Cricket Council match referee David Boon, who has officiated at every Test so far, will also miss Sydney after he too tested positive.
Silverwood’s absence is another major setback for England on a tour where little has gone right, suffering three heavy defeats in Brisbane, Adelaide and Melbourne to ensure Australia retained the hallowed Ashes urn with two Tests still to play.
And the timing could not have been worse, with his job widely seen as on the line.
Joe Root, whose captaincy in the Ashes has also been criticised, will overtake predecessor Alastair Cook’s record of 59 Tests at the helm when he leads the side out in Sydney.
Australia has experienced a surge in Covid cases in recent weeks, with an Omicron variant outbreak centred in Sydney that on Thursday recorded more than 12,000 cases.
In New South Wales, where Sydney is located, anyone considered a close contact is supposed to isolate for seven days, but authorities have pledged the rules would not impact the  “sacred” Ashes.
“The SCG [Sydney Cricket Ground] Test is sacred, an important date at the start of the third year of our life with Covid-19,” NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said this week.
“I want to assure the cricket-loving public, under our rules, any players with exposure to a known case of Covid-19 would be asked to test and isolate only until a negative result was received.”
Cricket Australia chief Nick Hockley was adamant the Test will go ahead.
“We’ve got very robust Covid-safe plans that are led by the venues working closely with the health authorities,” he told broadcaster ABC, with crowds of some 35,000 expected for the first few days.
“As long as everyone follows the advice, I think people can come in the knowledge they’re going to be safe.”
ANDERSON URGES SENIORS TO DELIVER
Meanwhile, veteran fast bowler James Anderson urged England’s senior players to come  together to help the side restore some pride with a competitive performance in the remaining Ashes Tests.
“We have to restore some pride and try and compete. That’s our main focus as players,” Anderson told British media.
“We  have to block out what’s happening off the field and focus on the  fourth and fifth tests.”
The veteran seamer, who is playing in his 10th  Ashes series, called on more experienced players in the England squad  to boost the team’s morale.
“It can be difficult at times,  especially for guys experiencing the Ashes for the first time who are  not that experienced with test cricket and touring,” Anderson said. “That’s  where the more senior players come in. We have to try and rally round,  make sure everyone is in a good place and a good headspace.”
The fifth and final Test is in Hobart, where there have been far fewer Covid cases than Sydney.

10,Biennial World Cup would ‘cannibalise’ women’s game: UEFA chief,"“It’s simply a bad idea and it will not happen because it is a bad idea, not because we are opposing it,” he says.","DUBAI: UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin has reiterated his opposition to FIFA’s plans to stage a biennial World Cup, saying the women’s tournament or the Olympics would be affected if they were held in the same year as the finals.
The European football governing body and its South American counterpart CONMEBOL have strongly opposed the idea which FIFA president Gianni Infantino has said would create an extra $4.4 billion in revenues for the world soccer organisation.
“Europe and South America are against [the plan] and those are the only [continents with] World Cup winners in history. The problem is that the World Cup has to be every four years to be interesting,” Ceferin said at the Expo 2020 Dubai fair.
“Second, if it would be every two years, it would cannibalise women’s football because it would be at the same year as the women’s football [World Cup], other sports, the Olympic Games — many mistakes.
“It’s simply a bad idea and it will not happen because it is a bad idea, not because we are opposing it.”
FIFA’s plans had the International Olympic Committee (IOC) worried with attendees at a summit earlier this month voicing  “serious concerns” over the proposals and its impact on the world sporting calendar.
“Why are the Olympic Games every four years? Because it’s an event that you have to look forward (to), that you have to wait [for], and you have to enjoy it,” Ceferin added.
“And it’s the biggest football event — it has to be every four years. But it’s very clear - 75% of fans around the world reject the idea [of a biennial World Cup].”

11,Bangladesh series becomes farewell tour for NZ great Taylor,MOUNT MAUNGANUI: The decision by New Zealand great Ross Taylor to end his illustrious Test career after the looming...,"MOUNT MAUNGANUI: The decision by New Zealand great Ross Taylor to end his illustrious Test career after the looming Bangladesh series has placed a new emphasis on the two matches which start at Mount Maunganui’s Bay Oval on Saturday.
From being a chance for New Zealand to get their World Test championship campaign back on track after the recent 1-0 loss to India, it has become a farewell to Taylor, a cricketing great who hit the winning runs when the Black Caps won the first World Test crown this year.
After the Tests, Taylor has a series of One-day Internationals to play against Australia and the Netherlands before stepping away from international cricket.
While he is uncomfortable with the closing weeks of his career being termed  “a farewell tour”, the 110-Test veteran accepts that’s the way it will be.
“It doesn’t sit that well with me but I know it needs to be done,” he said.
“I would have liked to have just pulled the stumps but it gives my family and friends and fans a chance to come and watch me for one last time.”
The 37-year-old has been a mainstay in the New Zealand batting order  since making his debut in 2006, amassing a plethora of records and  achievements, notably the most runs by a New Zealander (18,074) and most  appearances (445).
“It’s been an amazing journey and I feel incredibly fortunate to have represented my country for as long as I have,” he said.
“It’s  been such a privilege to play with and against some of the greats of  the game and to have created so many memories and friendships along the  way.
“But all good things must come to an end and the timing feels right for me.”
Taylor’s achievements include most Test runs by a New Zealander (7,584),  most ODI runs (8,581) most ODI 100s for New Zealand (21), most 100s in  all formats (40), the first player from any country to make 100  international appearances in each of the three formats, and the highest  Test score in Australia by a visiting player (290 at Perth, 2015)
The two-Test rubber against Bangladesh will also give him a chance to build on his 19 Test centuries and close in on the New Zealand record of 24 held by their incumbent captain Kane Williamson.
Bangladesh always struggle in New Zealand conditions and have never won there, losing nine from nine in five visits and unable to even scramble a draw in rain-disrupted Tests as they fail to make the transition from their slow-turning home wickets to the Black Caps’ traditional pace-friendly green tops.
They arrived in New Zealand on the back of a 2-0 home-series loss to Pakistan and without talismanic batsmen Shakib al Hasan, who made himself unavailable after being selected, and Mahmudullah, who retired recently.
Liton Das stood out against Pakistan, especially in the first Test with innings of 114, 59, although his best in New Zealand conditions is 33 at the Basin Reserve two years ago when Bangladesh were beaten by an innings and 12 runs.
That 2019 tour was shattered and the final Test in Christchurch abandoned after a gunman went on a murderous rampage at a mosque near the Hagley Oval stadium as the mainly Muslim Bangladesh team were arriving for prayers before a practice session.
Taylor said it would be good to have his final Test in Christchurch and considered his greatest achievement was turning himself into a Test player where he is now 38th all-time in Test runs.
“I always thought I could play ODI cricket, I wasn’t [sure] whether I’d be a good Test player or not, but I worked hard at that and I think that’s probably my greatest achievement,” he said.
“I could have just smacked it and averaged 30-odd but I changed my game for the team, I don’t think many people would have been able to move their game in that direction and I’m happy I made that decision.”
Meanwhile, Black Caps coach Gary Stead said Taylor would undoubtedly bow out as one of New Zealand’s greats.
“Ross  has always been a hugely respected member of the side and we’re  thankful for his contributions to the Black Caps over an incredible  career,” Stead said.
Williamson, unavailable for the Bangladesh  series while he rehabilitates from an elbow injury, said Taylor had  given his all to the New Zealand team over the years.
“He’s a  world-class player, our best with the bat over such a long period of  time and personally it’s been a pleasure to be involved in so many  partnerships with him across the formats,” Williamson said.
Taylor, Devon Conway and Tom Latham -- captaining the side in place of Williamson -- will anchor a strong New Zealand batting line-up, while Stead has gone for an all-out pace attack and dumped spinner Ajaz Patel just weeks after starring in India with his historic 10-wicket haul in the first innings of the second Test.
Stead’s blunt assessment was that New Zealand spinners don’t take wickets on home tracks.
In the past four Tests Bangladesh have played in New Zealand, 74 of the 76 wickets claimed by bowlers were taken by the quicks.
“That’s not necessarily the spinners’ fault, but shows the strength of where we’re at with our pace bowling unit at the moment,” Stead said, pointing to a Test squad that includes Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Kyle Jamieson, Neil Wagner and Matt Henry.

Chaos has reigned in the Premier League in December, with Covid-19 outbreaks decimating squads, forcing the postponement of 16 games and fuelling talk of a pause in play that never materialised. 
City have risen above it all. 
Seven straight victories. An eight-point lead. A 10-match winning streak. 
Such is City’s sudden dominance of the league that one of their rivals appears to be waving the white flag. 
“We have seven Covid cases, we have five or six players out for six or more weeks,” said Thomas Tuchel, the manager of second-placed Chelsea. “How should we compete in a title race?” 
While Tuchel was grumbling about his misfortune minutes after seeing Chelsea concede a stoppage-time goal to draw 1-1 with Brighton & Hove Albion at Stamford Bridge, City playing just 8 kilometres further west of London were seeing out a 1-0 win at Brentford to complete a perfect month of 21 points. 
TV cameras panned to City substitutes Raheem Sterling and Riyad Mahrez, two of the team’s in-form players who had been given a rest and were sitting alongside each other in the dugout having clearly been told they wouldn’t be coming on. Indeed, City manager Pep Guardiola didn’t make a single substitution, having rotated his starting lineup that contained a completely fresh attacking trio of Phil Foden, Jack Grealish and Gabriel Jesus. 
What luxury. Especially at a time when some teams have requested postponements because they couldn’t call up the minimum number of players required 13 plus a goalkeeper. 
And that just might be the difference. The best and most expensively assembled squad in the league managed by possibly the world’s top coach has coped best with the most grueling period of the season, when fixtures come thick and fast and English football attracts more eyeballs than ever because every other big European league is on a winter break. 
It was in December last year that City began a 21-match winning run in all competitions that lifted the team from a mid-table position in the Premier League albeit because the team had some games in hand to first place and a lead of 15 points. 
Fast forward a year and City were third, five points behind leaders Chelsea, after their 2-0 home loss to Crystal Palace on Oct 30. Ten straight wins later, City are eight points clear of Chelsea and nine ahead of third-placed Liverpool, whose 1-0 loss at injury-hit Leicester City on Tuesday was another late Christmas present for Guardiola. Liverpool have a game in hand on both City and Chelsea. 
City has a great opportunity to expand the gap, too. Chelsea and Liverpool meet on Sunday, so one or both of the teams are sure to drop points. By then, City will have played Arsenal. 
While fourth-placed Arsenal have also been in impressive form with four successive wins, Mikel Arteta’s side have fallen short against the big boys this season and were thrashed 5-0 away to City in August. 
Guardiola rubbished suggestions that another title was more or less in the bag after the win at Brentford, but the evidence to the contrary is stacking up. 
Only five times in the Premier League era has there been a gap of at least eight points at the top heading into Jan 1 and on each of those occasions the leaders won the title. 
In eight of the last 12 seasons the team at the summit at the turn of the year proved uncatchable. 
While Chelsea have a defensive crisis with Ben Chilwell (knee) out for the season and Thiago Silva, Andreas Christensen and Reece James also out injured, Liverpool will lose their two star forwards Mohamed Salah (Egypt) and Sadio Mane (Senegal) to the African Cup of Nations following the Chelsea game. 
City will also be deprived of Mahrez, who will play in the tournament for Algeria, but can still boast such an array of attacking options that the club was happy to sanction the sale of Spain forward Ferran Torres to Barcelona this week for an initial 55 million euros ($66 million). 
“We are on a good run, but it’s the end of December,” Guardiola said after the Brentford game. “There are many games to go. We are eight points in front but there are 54 still to play for and many tough games still to play. I’m not going to believe anyone who says its already done. The teams we have with [us] Chelsea and Liverpool are more than exceptional.” 
City’s irresistible surge means Sunday’s clash at Stamford Bridge could all but knock the losers out of the race. 
After three draws in their last four games, Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta said a win over Liverpool would be the perfect way to kick-start the chase of City. 
“Hopefully we can give our fans a good start to the new year in front of the fans here against Liverpool,” he said. “It is a tough moment, but we need to stick together and dig in. It is not an easy situation but this is how we have to overcome these difficult moments.”

The sports ministry confirmed it had cut capacity for open-air sports events from 75% to 50% and for indoors events, the capacity has been cut to 35%, fleshing out the details of a decree on event restrictions announced on Wednesday night.
Daily coronavirus cases have soared in Italy this week, reaching a record 98,030 on Wednesday, with the number of hospitalised patients rising.
The country’s top league, Serie A, is currently on a two-week winter break, but a string of major clubs have halted the sale of tickets ahead of the return of league action on Jan 6.
Champions Inter Milan released a statement on Thursday saying they have suspended ticket sales  “while the club awaits further details”.
Juventus have halted sales for their first three home games of 2022 against Napoli, Udinese and Sampdoria, while Napoli have done likewise for matches against Sampdoria, Fiorentina and their Europa League tie with Barcelona on Feb 24. AS Roma stopped sales on Wednesday for their games against Juventus, Cagliari and Lecce, while Lazio subsequently suspended sales for their next game against Empoli.
Juventus home clash with Napoli and Roma’s trip to AC Milan are the two stand-out fixtures when Serie A returns in January, with all four clubs currently in the top six.
