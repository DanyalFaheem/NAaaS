1,Khyber Mail escapes disaster near Mian Channu,"Driver, assistant suspended for a lack of vigilance.","LAHORE: The Karachi-bound 2-Down Khyber Mail escaped disaster on Thursday after it was automatically diverted to the sand-hump ending line as the driver failed to apply brakes in time to stop at the Mian Channu railway station.  
The train driver admitted his fault of not applying brakes in time (1,200 metres from the assigned platform of the railway station) due to feeling of chest pain while entering the station’s jurisdiction.  
Pakistan Railways (PR) Chief Executive Officer Nisar Memon suspended driver Muhammad Zubair and his assistant Muhammad Danish from service for not performing duty vigilantly that led to damaging the train’s engine and the attached brake van.  
“We have suspended the driver and his assistant and asked them to report to their respective division to face an inquiry that will be conducted by a team of three senior officials on Friday (today),” Mr Memon told Dawn. 

Driver, assistant suspended for a lack of vigilance  

Reports said the train departed from Lahore at 8:15am. When it reached near Sahiwal, driver Muhammad Hanif received a call from home about the sudden death of his mother-in-law. On receiving the information, the driver gave a message to the control room to relieve him on the way and arrange a new driver to take the train to the station (Multan) where a new driver was to replace him for further travel. 
Upon receiving the information from Hanif, the officials conveyed to the Khanewal station admin to arrange a driver and sent him towards up-track so that he could catch Khyber Mail on the way, relieve the previous driver and take the train to Multan. 
“I reached Chichawanti station through Business Express train and took charge from the driver of the Khyber Mail that also reached there in the meantime. After relieving him from the duty, I started journey. But as soon as I entered the starting point (yard / outer signals) of the station, I started feeling pain in my chest,” driver Zubair told Dawn.  
He said he immediately kept a tablet under his tongue and, in the meantime, crossed the point from where he was supposed to apply the brakes. “When alerted at the speed of about 100km per hour, I applied emergency brakes (from a distance of 300 meters from the platform on the main line). Thus the train was automatically diverted to the sand-hump line by the signalling system. And the locomotive and the brake van shoved into the sand dune and stopped eventually,” he explained. 
Zubair said his assistant Danish had told him to apply the brakes from the designated point but he couldn’t hear him due to chest pain. “But when we were about 300 meters away from the station at a speed of about 100km / hour, he (the assistant) himself applied brakes besides alerting me again. I also applied emergency brakes,” he said.  
According to an official source, the rail traffic at the down track remained disrupted for some time. “Moreover, Khyber Mail train’s departure from Mian Channu also delayed for two and a half hours,” the official said, adding that a relief train was also dispatched to the site to take the locomotive and the brake van out of the sand dune.  
“It took more than four hours to take the affected engine and the van out of the sand dune. The survey for assessing damage is being done at present,” he said.

3,Local govts term ends today,"LAHORE: As local bodies complete their tenure on Friday (today), mayors, chairmen and other elected representatives...","LAHORE: As local bodies complete their tenure on Friday (today), mayors, chairmen and other elected representatives held on Thursday a concluding ceremony in the Town Hall.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) Punjab government had dissolved the local bodies constituted under the Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) 2013 in May 2019 soon after coming to power.
However, the Supreme Court ordered restoration of local government institutions after declaring their dissolution as unconstitutional.
In October, the local government representatives assumed the charge after the Punjab government formally issued a notification to implement the orders of the Supreme Court for the restoration of the local government.
Lahore Mayor retired Col Mubashir Javed of the PML-N told Dawn that the gathering was attended by all the UC chairmen. He said their tenure would end on today and he would formally visit the office to hand over shields to the staff working with him.
Mr Javed said that they had eased the process of receiving death, birth and marriage certificates during their tenure of the last two and half months as the citizens were facing problems after suspension of the local bodies and they would have to bribe clerks to get certificates.

4,Increase in cybercrime: FIA finds it difficult to lay hands on suspects operating abroad,"TTP, TLP also involved in cyber terrorism.","LAHORE: Year 2021 saw an increase in involvement of suspects operating from outside the country in cybercrimes, making it difficult for the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cybercrime wing to lay its hands on them. 
In 23 per cent of the complaints, social media networking site — Facebook — was used as a medium.  
Of over 100,000 complaints filed with the FIA cybercrime wing across the country in 2021, most were related to (women) harassment, financial fraud, defamation, child pornography, and hate speech. 
In cases related to the modesty of a natural person — uploading objectionable pictures and videos of women by ex-husband, ex-fiancé or boyfriend (to blackmail them) — the FIA put 325 such offenders behind bars. 

TTP, TLP also involved in cyber terrorism 

Of the total complaints, over 75,000 were processed at the verification stage and about 15,000 were upgraded into inquiries and over 8,700 disposed of. The FIA wing arrested 1,160 suspects and filed challan in 552 cases in court of law. So far 28 of them have been convicted.  
Child pornography is another area in which cybercrime wing receives complaints not only from here but also from abroad. According to the FIA statistics, 52 persons were arrested for their alleged involvement in either producing, distributing, or transmitting pornographic material related to children. 
The FIA also arrested 185 suspects involved in cyber terrorism and hate speech during the period under review. The social media activists of banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) are involved in this offence.  
In blackmailing and extortion, the agency arrested 185 suspects. As many as 388 were arrested for their involvement in financial fraud and forgery. In case of dignity of a natural person (defaming someone on social media platforms), 178 suspects were arrested in 2021.  
Students reported 32 per cent of the cyber crimes to the FIA. 
FIA cybercrime wing chief Babur Bakht Qureshi told Dawn on Thursday that the agency acted swiftly, especially in women harassment and child pornography complaints. “We have zero tolerance in such cases,” he said and added that the wing’s conviction rate was above 90 per cent.  
“The expansion of the internet has increased child pornography cases. Online communities have promoted communication and collaboration among child pornography offenders. Due to the heinous nature of the crime the cybercrime wing has established a separate cell to curb this menace,” he said. 
Babur Bakht Qureshi further said in different cybercrime offences against local citizens, the suspects had been operating abroad, making the job of FIA difficult to go after them as it did not have the required treaties with international bodies. He said the FIA under Director General Sanaullah Abbasi had been in correspondence with such foreign bodies to sign the treaties which suited Pakistan.  
Mr Qureshi was of the view that with emerging technologies in the IT industry, the rate of cybercrimes had also shot up exponentially all over the world. 
“Pakistan is no exception to this phenomenon which can be gauged from the fact that FIA which is an authorised agency by law to deal with the cybercrimes in Pakistan has received 84,764 complaints in 2020, 300 per cent more than the complaints received in 2019.” 
He further said the major instrument used in the commission of cyber-related financial frauds in Pakistan was the availability of fake SIMs, activated through fake thumb prints using silicon papers. 
“All branchless banking and online frauds are committed through these fake SIMs. The medium used by the fraudsters are through call /SMS, email, whatsapp, Facebook, spoofed websites and skimming devices,” Mr Qureshi said and added mode of transfer was mostly branchless banking, IBFT, ATM, Credit Card and crypto currency. 
In 2021 only, more than 60,000 fake activated SIMs, 6,700 silicon thumb impressions and 3,000 silicon sheets were recovered during crackdown in different parts of the country. 
“Despite shortage of resources, the FIA cybercrime wing is making consistent efforts to cope with these multidimensional challenges,” Mr Qureshi said.

5,CM directs HED to relax higher education policy,Move aims at facilitating private sector to set up institutes,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Usman Buzdar on Thursday directed the Higher Education Department (HED) to relax its policy to facilitate the private sector in establishing new institutions of higher education with strict accreditation process.  
He chaired a meeting of the department at his office to review the progress on the establishment of new universities in the province. Punjab Minister for Higher Education Raja Yassir Humayun Sarfraz, Finance Minister Hashim Jawan Bakht, HED secretary Javed Iqbal Bukhari, SMBR and others were present.  
The CM directed to speedily resolve issues relating to establishment of new universities as the facility would, particularly, benefit female students in remote areas.
He accorded approval to transfer state lands for the establishment of new colleges in different areas as the government was striving to extend facilities of higher education to the youth at their doorstep.

Move aims at facilitating private sector to set up institutes

He said the government was committed to transforming Punjab into a hub of higher education and improving the international ranking of universities.
He said the Lahore Technopolis would prove a game changer initiative and Punjab was being transformed through the promotion of quality education and vowed to ensure ease in education promotion for the private sector.  
One of the participants in the meeting [on condition of anonymity] told Dawn that the government was going to facilitate the private sector in terms of formulating a policy to relax the conditions that are considered impediment to establishment of new institutions.  
He said the government intended to do so in spite of what Supreme Court directed in its judgement about shutting down illegal campuses of private universities in the country.
On Dec 15, a three-member bench headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial heard the case and directed the HEC to award degrees [through some special arrangement] to the students who had passed out of illegal campuses. It said uniform implementation of the HEC’s policies should be ensured throughout the country.  
He said the government should be mindful of the fact that policy making is the sole prerogative of HEC. “Any alteration in higher education policy in violation of guidelines would be a clear transgression against HEC’s authority,” he said.
However, Raja Yassir Humayun rejected the claim of relaxing the policy and facilitating the private sector. He told Dawn that they were only streamlining the university charter process as the [private universities] charters were passed in the assembly through private bills thereby by-passing the HED and PHEC.
He said some of the ‘genuine’ applicants had to face difficulty in achieving the charter due to the lengthy process of HED and they wanted to change the policy. However, accreditation process would be made strict. “If any institute/ university fails to meet the accreditation criteria and does not appoint competent faculty its charter will be cancelled,” he said.  
Humayun said the department was just streamlining the process of awarding charter and was not relaxing the policy.

6,Plots allotment case against Nawaz not closed: NAB,The anti-graft watchdog had reopened investigation into the allotment of plots to 13 people in violation of rules in 2018.,"LAHORE: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Thursday declared that an inquiry against ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif for illegally allotting plots of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) was still underway.
“The case of illegal allotment of LDA plots by Nawaz Sharif is still under investigation at the NAB Lahore. Its closure has not been recommended at any level,” a NAB spokesperson responded to reports that the investigation against the PML-N Quaid had been closed in this matter. 
Since the last week transfer of the bureau’s director general for Lahore, Shahzad Saleem, who remained in the headlines in recent years for proactively pursuing alleged corruption cases of Nawaz Sharif, his brother and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and their family members, there was an impression in some political and media sections that perhaps this arrangement has been made to ‘facilitate’ the Sharifs. 
Bureaucrat Jamil Ahmed, who was waiting for posting at the bureau’s headquarters, has been posted as director general for Lahore region.
A source privy to the development told Dawn that the anti-graft body had virtually closed the LDA plots allotment inquiry against Nawaz for its failure to trace the beneficiaries. “The closure of this matter at this stage might have triggered speculations that after the appointment of new Lahore DG the Sharifs have started getting favours. Thereby, the NAB was quite categorical in this regard,” he said. 
The NAB, in September 2018, had reopened investigation into the allotment of plots to 13 people in violation of rules and the laid-down procedure during the tenure of Nawaz Sharif as chief minister in late 1980s.
The NAB had summoned all beneficiaries through Lahore police. But police told the bureau that they had failed to trace any of the beneficiaries.
The investigation into this case was first initiated in 2000 after Gen Musharraf toppled Mr Sharif’s government (in Oct 1999) but later it was not pursued.
Mr Sharif has been in London since Nov 2019 for his ‘medical treatment’. Several PML-N leaders have recently claimed that he is returning to the country ‘very soon’.

7,LePark worst performing public sector company,"LTC, PLDDB, FPC also ‘flagged red’","LAHORE: The Punjab government has identified public sector company Lahore Parking Company (LePark) as the worst performer as it failed on all parameters, scoring only seven out of 100 marks on the provincial performance scale.
The company inspected by the Special Monitoring Unit (SMU) on the directions of Chief Minister Usman Buzdar has been “flagged red” on all indicators as it failed to perform any of its assigned duties, earning displeasure warnings by the provincial chief executive last week.
The SMU had reported that the company had failed to expand the number of parking sites or enforce standards on existing sites. The company lacked qualified human resources to develop and execute a robust business plan.
The SMU report stated that the Metropolitan Corporation Lahore (MCL) had failed to provide adequate oversight and ownership of the company. The company had also been unable to invest in technological solutions to digitise its operations. The monitoring unit also observed that the company after paying share to MCL from its revenues, was left with insufficient capital to invest in growth.

LTC, PLDDB, FPC also ‘flagged red’ 

LTC: The Lahore Transport Company (LTC) has also been determined as a “worst performer” as it secured only 23 marks out of 100 marks scale – far less than even passing marks, if educational examination standards are taken as a benchmark.
The SMU in its report stated that the LTC was not operating any buses and all its notified routes were non-operational. It reported that the company was highly dependent on government fiscal handouts and was unable to recover its expenditures.
The monitoring unit stated that no feasibility study or viability assessment had been undertaken for its existing and planned routes. It reported that most senior management positions were filled on additional charge/ad hoc basis. The company’s engagement with stakeholders such as the PPP Authority was also found weak. It had an overlapping mandate with the Punjab Transport Authority, creating administrative and fiscal confusion.
PLDDB: The Punjab Livestock & Dairy Development Board has also been “flagged red” as it could score only 28 out of 100 marks.  
The SMU reported that the company’s mandate to facilitate farmers in production, processing and marketing of commodities through modern infrastructure and farming, remained an unfulfilled task.  
The company was unable to decrease cost of milk production or improve the output and quality of beef.  
The monitoring unit reported that the company management remained unable to appoint key leadership and board of directors. The Punjab livestock and dairy development department’s ownership and oversight of the company also remained weak.
FPC: The Faisalabad Parking Company has also earned “worst performer” remarks as it also scored 28 out of 100 marks.
As per the SMU monitoring report, the FPC did not undertake any credible study to assess the parking potential of Faisalabad. The company’s reported parking revenue was considerably lower than its potential as it was found providing free-of-cost parking to public events. The monitoring unit stated that the FPC was lacking a credible business plan for the expansion and digital enhancement of parking services.

9,Suspect can’t be denied bail merely on wish: LHC,Judge observes it is not possible in every case to prove mala fide but it can be gathered from the facts and circumstances.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that if a suspect has a good case for post-arrest bail, then merely on the wish of the complainant he cannot be sent behind bars by denying him pre-arrest bail.  
Justice Tariq Nadeem passes the ruling confirming the pre-arrest bail of four suspects in an abduction case registered under section 365 of PPC.  
The judge observes that after going through the narration of the First Information Report (FIR) and the evidentiary material collected by police and presented before court, it divulges that there is a delay of seven days in registration of the FIR and no exegesis has been given by the complainant with respect to this delay, which indicates that FIR has been lodged with due deliberation and consultation.  
The judge further observes that a careful reading of the FIR reveals that an offence under section 365 is not constituted because it is admitted fact that at the time of alleged occurrence the petitioners/suspects and the complainant were present on the spot and in the presence of complainant, the petitioners abducted his son and took him at the shop of one of the suspects.  
The judge notes section 365 will be applied in case of kidnapping and abduction of any person with intention to be secretly and wrongfully confined. However, the judge observes that final determination of the offence will be made by the trial court after recording and evaluating the evidence. He says the allegations of torture and beating have not been supported by medical report of the victim.
The judge states that criminal and civil litigation has been pending between the parties, therefore, false involvement of the petitioners in the case at the hands of the complainant party cannot be ruled out.  
Justice Nadeem observes that it is not possible in each and every case to prove the mala fide but the same can be gathered from the facts and circumstances of the case.  
“Even otherwise, if an accused person has a good case for post- arrest bail then mere at the wish of the complainant, he cannot be sent behind the bars for few days by dismissing his application for pre-arrest bail,” he adds.

10,PEC rejects equivalence of tech diploma to engineering bachelor’s degree,LAHORE: The Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) has opposed a decision of the Higher Education Commission (HEC)...,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) has opposed a decision of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) declaring a diploma in technology equivalent to a bachelor’s degree in engineering.
A spokesperson for the HEC told Dawn that it was a consensus decision and 11, out of 12 participants, (eight of them were VCs, including the chairperson of VCs committee who attended along with the representatives of the PEC ) agreed to the formulation.
The PEC, however, said the decision was a sheer violation of a Supreme Court judgement issued in 2018.
The HEC’s notification states “HEC is pleased to modify the decision made in 8th Accreditation and Equivalence Committee Meeting regarding equivalence of B.Tech (Hons) with BSc (Engg)/ Bachelor of Engineering, i.e ‘both degrees of BSc (Engg)/BE Engineering and BTech (Hons) are not equivalent but could be considered at par for employment, grade, promotion, etc on their respective cadre/streams as under “Bachelor’s degree in engineering (minimum 16 years education) and bachelor’s degree in equivalent technology (minimum 16 years education) are at par for recruitment, pay scales and grades”.
The PEC, however, says it is a statutory regulatory body enacted by an Act of Parliament to regulate the engineering profession from engineering education to engineering practice.
Rejecting HEC’s decision, the PEC said it constantly conveyed to the HEC that engineering and technology qualifications are two distinct streams of the engineering profession and cannot be considered equivalent, however, could be considered on par for the purpose of recruitment, promotion, grades, etc. Both qualifications are regulated internationally through their separate accords/fora, i.e. engineering qualification by the Washington Accord, whereas, engineering technology by the Sydney Accord.
It states PEC Act-1976, Section 27(5A) states that “No person shall unless registered as a registered engineer or professional engineer, hold any post in an engineering organization where he has to perform professional engineering work.”
The PEC cites the Supreme Court of Pakistan judgement that “The government shall not allow or permit any person to perform professional engineering work as defined in PEC Act, who does not possess accredited engineering qualification from accredited engineering institution and his name is not registered as a registered engineer or professional engineer under PEC Act.”
PEC representatives also discussed and emphasised the matter in the 10th meeting of the Accreditation and Equivalence Committee of the HEC, however, its stance was not reflected in the minutes.
Consequently, the HEC decision has caused enormous confusion for the engineering fraternity, stakeholders and employers and it was taken as a violation to the PEC Act 1976 and the judgement taken by the apex court.
The council requested that the statement finalised by the HEC as reflected in the notification be rationalised with the further elaboration that both the streams/ professionals cannot be replaceable for each other, however, can have career growth in their respective domain of engineering profession and practice.
Punjab University Vice Chancellor and PEC Convener Niaz Ahmad Akhtar the HEC immediately withdraw the notification, otherwise, the PEC would file a contempt of court appeal in the Supreme Court against the HEC.
He said HEC has no right to equate an engineering degree with a non-engineering discipline and as per PEC Act-1976, the Engineering Council should regulate the engineering profession.
He said the PEC representative who represented the Council in the HEC meeting must be fixed for the negligence and the VCs of engineering universities who participated in the meeting should also clarify their position, otherwise, they should not be invited to the PEC meetings in future.

There was a need to develop a unanimous educational curriculum and a joint army of the Muslim world, Mr Haq said at the ‘Unity of Ummah’ conference at Mansoora on Thursday.
Iranian scholar and head of Iran’s Aalimi Idara Taqreeb Mazahib Islami Secretary-General Dr Hameed Sheharyari was the chief guest.
Mr Haq said the Iran-Saudi Arabia cold relations were a matter of great concern for Muslims around the world. Both countries, he said, should settle down their issues for the great benefit of Ummah. He said Pakistan should play a role to make the two important countries of the Islamic world closer to each other.
The JI chief said it was expected that foreign ministers of the Muslim world during the OIC in Islamabad would recognize the Afghan government. But, he regretted, they failed to make the announcement due to US pressure. He said it was the duty of the Muslim world to help the people of Afghanistan.
Mr Haq said sectarianism was the major issue being faced by the Muslim world. He said western powers under a conspiracy spread violence and hate among the followers of different schools of Islamic thought. Muslim scholars, he said, should play a role to promote peace and unity among different faiths.
He said the JI was striving hard to promote unity among Muslims of Pakistan and the world. But, he said, this was the duty of the governments and, particularly, Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Malaysia should come forward to strengthen ties among Islamic countries.
Dr Hameed thanked the JI leadership for organising the event and inviting him to speak to the scholars. He said Iran and Pakistan were two tested brothers and would stay together in all circumstances.

PU  Vice-Chancellor Prof Dr Niaz Ahamd Akhtar  said there were vast  opportunities of cooperation in the higher  education sector as Chinese  universities could admit Pakistani students  in large numbers. He said  Chinese institutions should be registered with  accreditation bodies  such as the Pakistan Engineering Council and the  Pakistan Medical  Commission to resolve the issues Pakistanis graduating  from China face.   
Muhammad Mehdi called for increasing defence cooperation between Pakistan and China. He argued that unlike the West, China does not bar Pakistan from using weapons against any enemy including India.  
Mr  Mehdi said Beijing had already extraordinary defence cooperation with  Islamabad in the form of Al-Khalid tank and JF-17 Thunder combat  aircraft. He said a nefarious propaganda was being made to portray that  the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) would plunge Pakistan into a  huge debt. He said it’s necessary to make the project more open to the  public so that no propaganda may affect the friendship.

The Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) is on top of the list which alone has to pay Rs200.349 billion.  
The payables of the PSO, country’s top public sector Karachi-based oil marketing and distribution company, stood at Rs138.703 billion till Dec 29, Dawn has learnt. 
According to a document, the power generation companies (GENCOs) are to pay Rs140.703 billion, followed by Hub Power Company (HUBCO) and Kot Addu Power Company (KAPCO) that are to pay Rs38.974 billion and Rs5.009 billion respectively. The SNGPL is to pay Rs200.349 billion to the PSO, which includes Rs6.754 billion charged as variation on the basis of exchange rate gain / loss (Liquefied Natural Gas). 
The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is to pay Rs39.721 billion while the government of Pakistan is to pay Rs17.684 billion that includes Rs9.774 billion and Rs7.910 billion charged as price differential claims and exchange rate differential in a loan. The PSO, however, has to pay Rs138.703 billion to refineries and other local and international clients. 
The PSO’s receivables continue to see an upward trend as they reportedly surged to Rs362 billion, Rs374.539 billion and Rs402.863 billion in August, October and November respectively. 
SNGPL’s Managing Director Ali J. Hamdani said the company’s core priority was to clear dues of the PSO and others concerned and to provide gas to all consumers. “Yes we have to make payments to the PSO. But the fact is that we have also to receive bills / payments in billions from our customers / consumers,” he said.  
“So, we make payments to the PSO from time to time after we receive payments from our consumers. It is very clear that we are not doing this intentionally,” Mr Hamdani added.
