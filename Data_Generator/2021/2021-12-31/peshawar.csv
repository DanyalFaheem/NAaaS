1,Fuel adjustment charges in power bills challenged,PESHAWAR: Three residents of Mardan district have moved the Peshawar High Court against the ‘inflated’...,"PESHAWAR: Three residents of Mardan district have moved the Peshawar High Court against the ‘inflated’ electricity bills due to a levy of hefty amounts on account of fuel price adjustment (FPA) and requested it to declare those excessive charges illegal and unconstitutional.
Sajjad Ali and two other petitioners claimed that the consumers of Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) had received highly inflated electricity bills this month with the FPA, which was almost two times more than the original bill of the consumption of electricity.
They stated that the cost of electricity was much lesser in the bills then the FPA which was added to the original bills.
They have also sought interim relief from the court requesting to suspend imposition of FPA in the monthly bills till final disposal of the petition.
The respondents in the petition are the Wapda chairman, its general manager (operation), Pesco managing director, secretary of the power division, and chairman of the Pesco board of directors.
In the petition filed through lawyers Noor Alam Khan and Shabina Noor, the petitioners insisted that if a consumer had consumed electricity to the tune of Rs2,000, they had received electricity bill of Rs4,500, including Rs2,500 as FPA.
They also attached several electricity bills with their petition.
The petitioners claimed that the infuriated consumers had been visiting Pesco offices of different sub-divisions with their inflated bills, but to no avail.
They said the consumers had also been staging protests wherein they had been demanding of the government to reduce the FPA tax as that was an injustice with the consumers.
The petitioners said the protests led the closure of roads and disruption of traffic inconveniencing motorists and commuters.
They said charging the people excessively instead of the actual cost of power consumption was an unconstitutional act on part of the government.
The petitioners said the issuance of inflated bills was a violation of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution and it was in the domain of the high court to check such unconstitutional acts.

2,Corporal punishment petition not maintainable: regulator,PSRA seeks plea’s disposal saying probe dismisses student’s allegation,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Private Schools Regulatory Authority (PSRA) has requested the Peshawar High Court to reject the petition of a fourth-grade girl against her expulsion from a private school in Mardan insisting it has the exclusive authority under the law to decide a dispute between the school and its students.
It also disputed the claim of petitioner Ansa Khan that she was subjected to corporal punishment and claimed that a committee constituted by it for inquiring into the matter had found out those allegations as unsubstantiated.
In its comments filed by the managing director, a respondent, on the petition, the PSRA claimed that the plea was not maintainable and was liable to be dismissed.
The petitioner, who moved the high court through her mother Seema Gul, alleged that she was severely punished and humiliated by a teacher in the Mardan Model School and College and was even expelled.

PSRA seeks plea’s disposal saying probe dismisses student’s allegation

She requested the court to declare her expulsion by the school illegal and order her re-enrolment.
A high court bench will take up the case on Jan 12.
In the comments filed through Barrister Asadul Mulk, the PSRA said its senior officers came to know about the alleged incident through a news item and instantly ordered an inquiry to ascertain the facts.
It added that the findings of the inquiry committee was communicated to all relevant parties and the matter was closed.
The PSRA said that no review petition was filed against the said inquiry report by the petitioner or on her behalf by any other person.
It also said that the matter was never agitated before the authority by the petitioner and that the authority had conducted the inquiry into it on its own.
The authority contended that under Section 27 of the KPSRA Act, 2017, it had exclusive authority to adjudicate upon all kinds of matter and issues related to or concerning private schools and provide relief in appropriate cases.
It was added that the constitutional jurisdiction of the high court had been invoked by the petitioner without availing the alternate statutory remedy available to her.
The authority also submitted the inquiry report along with comments declaring that the allegations of corporal punishment could not be established as neither any FIR of the matter was registered by the police nor was there any medical proof of corporal punishment available on record.
The PSRA said that the girl student had never been expelled by the school and instead, she remained absent from the school on her own since Sept 27, 2021.
According to the report, the main bone of contention appeared to be an amount of Rs40,200 outstanding against the petitioner’s sister, who had left the school without clearing dues and obtaining the school leaving certificate.
However, the inquiry committee declared that the behaviour of the school’s academic coordinator was inappropriate as she had misbehaved and intimidated the mother and uncle of the schoolgirl and even she was unresponsive towards the committee.

3,"ANP, JI reject FPA in electricity bills, calls for refund of amount",Protests held in Swabi against hike in power charges,"PESHAWAR/SWABI: Awami National Party and Jamaat-i-Islami have rejected the imposition of exorbitant fuel price adjustment (FPA) in electricity bills and urged the federal government to refund the additional amount charged under this head to consumers in the next month’s bills.
ANP provincial president Aimal Wali Khan said in a statement here on Thursday that a court had already declared the excessive FPA as illegal, adding that extorting billions of rupees from the poor people under this head was intolerable.
Aimal Wali said that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government was unable to raise its voice for provincial share in the national resources, particularly for the pending Rs650 billion net hydel profit (NHP), to initiate some development schemes in the province.
He said it was duty of the federal ministers and other lawmakers from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to play their role for release of the pending NHP without any delay.

Protests held in Swabi against hike in power charges

The ANP provincial chief said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was producing hydel power at the minimum price of Rs1.50 per unit, but the people here had to purchase it at Rs18-20 per unit, which was a sheer injustice.
In Swabi, two separate protest demonstrations were held on Thursday against fuel price adjustment in the electricity bills while terming it a great injustice with the people.
The Da Haq Awaz, Swabi, organised a protest march which was participated by local leaders and workers of various political parties.
The protesters gathered in Swabi, marched to the district office of Peshawar Electric Supply Company and staged a protest in front of its main gate. They chanted slogans against the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government for charging a big amount of money under the FPA from the power consumers.
They claimed that the FPA issue could not be resolved by the government as the expenditures of luxurious lifestyle of the rulers were being transferred to consumers this way.
Addressing the protesters, Ihsanul Haq, head of the Da Haq Awaz, said that their struggle would continue till the removal of FPA from the power bills.
Mohammed Ali, Anjuman-i-Dokandaran district president, said the government should take steps to immediately withdraw the FPA.
Wahid Shah, former swabi tehsil nazim, said this was the time for a collective struggle against the injustice.
Jamaat-i-Islami held a protest in Topi tehsil and its leaders and workers marched through the main bazaar while chanting slogans against the ruling party.
The protesters waving the electricity bills said they were not in a position to pay the heavy inflated bills.
Mian Iftikhar Bacha, JI district chief, said people of the district had given sacrifices for the construction of Tarbela Dam and Ghazi Barotha Dam, but they faced prolonged outages and excessive bills.

The event was organised by the Saibaan Development Organisation.
Islamic scholar Maulana Wassiur Rehman said the incidence of gender-based violence and early and forced marriages was increasing in the district, so the ulema should educate the people on preventive measures.
He said better public awareness was imperative for the effective resolution of the issue.
Mr Rehman said Islam and the law granted woman and men equal rights to life, including share in inheritance, so the law- enforcement agencies should act to ensure it.

Mr Alfaizi said the women victims of early marriages could step out of the wedlock after attaining puberty.

6,Literati resent shifting of Urdu Science Board Library to Lahore,Literary bodies urge govt to arrange suitable place for their activities,"PESHAWAR: Poets and writers affiliated with over a dozen literary organisations here have taken strong exception to the shifting of Urdu Science Board Library, Peshawar chapter, to Lahore.
The library has been merged into the National Language Promotion Department (NLPD), a reliable source confirmed here on Thursday.
Prof Shakil Nayab, noted Urdu writer and secretary of Halqa-i-Arbab-i-Zauq, Peshawar, told this correspondent that he was informed on Tuesday through a phone call that weekly literary session of the Halqa would no more be held at Urdu Science Board Library hall located in Khyber Bazaar.
Literary bodies and associations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have shown dismay over the decision and demanded of the federal and provincial governments to either reverse the move or arrange for suitable alternative for resuming literary activities in the provincial metropolis.

Literary bodies urge govt to arrange suitable place for their activities

He said he rushed to the library hall and found that bookshelves and furniture had been shifted to Lahore and he had to inform all those invited to the weekly session through social media because the gathering was supposed to be held the same evening.
“For the first time in over four decades, Halqa-i-Arbab-i-Zauq weekly session was postponed indefinitely. It was the only place where poets and writers gathered on weekly basis and held multiple activities, including seminars, workshops and literary debates,” he observed.
Prof Nasir Ali Syed, senior executive council member of Halqa-i-Arab Zauq, said he was dismayed over shifting of the library, which was tantamount to depriving poets and writers of their right to promote the national cause through literary activities.
“KP literati and even those from abroad contacted me to know about the issue. The otherwise small hall has played a significant role in providing an opportunity to poets, writers and critics to gather here and groom budding bards for over 40 years,” Prof Nasir commented.
Prof Abaseen Yousafzai in his remarks said that shifting of the library to Lahore was not good news for the KP writers, adding it was a small school doing a great job, as literary giants like Ameer Hamza Khan Shinwari, Qalandar Momand, Ajmal Khattak, Reza Hamdani, Farigh Bukhari and several others had used this hall as a strong literary forum.
“I expect the PTI government will take notice of this move and facilitate the KP literati so they could continue their literary activities. Peshawar being a hub of literary and cultural activities should have a place for promoting the national cause,” he said.

8,KMU begins coronavirus testing for Omicron variant,"Amid declining incidence, virus kills one, affects 36 more.","PESHAWAR: The Khyber Medical University, Peshawar, has begun the coronavirus testing for Omicron variant amid a constant decline in the infection-related deaths and cases across the province during the last one week.
A man lost life to the virus and 36 were infected with it in the province on Thursday, according to a government report.
The World Health Organisation has provided Covid-19 variant detection kits to the Public Health Reference Laboratory at the KMU to locally process the positive samples for ascertaining if there are other variants, lab scientists told Dawn.
They said they had so far sent 300 positive coronavirus samples to the National Institute of Health, Islamabad, for Omicron detection but no case of that variant was found.

Amid declining incidence, virus kills one, affects 36 more

The lab scientists said all cases were Delta variant’s.
“The province has to detect Omicron because it spreads very fast. It would go Delta’s way which has also spread rapidly in the province. However, there is no case reported so far,” a lab scientist said.
According to him, the WHO’s sequencing kitswill enable the province to promptly diagnose the various variants.
They said the NIH took time in testing the samples and dispatching results as it catered to the entire country.
“Now, we will be sending specimens to the NIH to double-check Omicron cases,” a source said.
He said the Omicron variant hadn’t been found in the province due to the people’s vaccination against the virus.
When contacted, Khyber Medical University Vice-Chancellor Prof Ziaul Haq said the university had got a state-of-the-art Covid-19 lab, which had carried out 90 per cent of the province’s total 3.8 million PCRs.
“With new kits, we have begun processing more samples for Covid-19 variants, including Omicron, which is very dangerous due to fast transmission,” he said.
Prof Zia said the Khyber Medical University had started from 40 coronavirus tests daily when the virus appeared in the province and later helped develop over 20 Covid-19 labs, including 12 in public hospitals and eight in private health facilities.
“Our faculty members have played a major role in developing labs, which can be utilised for detection of other diseases after the Covid-19 crisis is over. We require such labs to be able to fight future epidemics,” he said.
The VC said all tests were done free of charge by foreign-trained lab scientists.
Meanwhile, a health department report said only Peshawar continued to record Covid-19 deaths and cases in the province, where those numbers were on the decline.
According to it, of the total 5,927 deaths since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, 2,881 died in Peshawar, which is 48.61 per cent of the province’s total deaths.
The capital city has 66,411 Covid-19 cases of the province’s overall tally of 181,334. Out of the total cases, 96 per cent have recovered from the virus, while the active one total 568, which include 256 in Peshawar, the epicentre of the infection outbreak.

Prof Minhajul Hassan said that Quaid-i-Azam was not just a charismatic leader, but he was an outstanding professional too. He changed the world map with his leadership qualities and professional skills.
Prof Farooq Dar said it was a moment of deep concern for the nation that it was unable to follow the Quaid’s principles.
“We take the struggles for granted as we are not aware of the hard struggle and difficulties faced by him and how he handled all the difficulties with his skills and abilities. We need the same determination as of Quaid to put our country on the path of progress,” he said.
Dr Aslam Syed said that Quaid-i-Azam never compromised on his principles. He stressed the need that the nation should learn a lesson from the struggle of the leader who succeeded to get a separate homeland for the Muslims. He said people of Pakistan were lucky to have an independent state.
Prof Razia Sultana said that as a country they were facing many problems because they had forgotten the principles of Quaid. She said the country’s progress depended on acquiring new knowledge and adopting international standards of education.

Puran tehsil transporters union gave the call for the protest and wheel jam strike across the Shangla sub-division after the TMA started receiving the toll tax. The transporters said the strike would continue till the collection of toll tax was stopped.
The protesting transporters parked their vehicles at stands and started the strike, which also caused severe problems to local commuters.
Sultan Ali, a cab driver, said he hardly earned Rs1,200 in two trips a day of which Rs600 was spent on fuel and Rs100 paid to TMA as toll tax besides payment of the stand fee. He said the remaining Rs400 was insufficient even for buying food for his family.
He said they were willing to pay Rs50 a day to the TMA instead of Rs 100 i.e. Rs50 each on departure and arrival.
Arifullah, a driver, said they now would have to go to Lahore or Karachi for labour as nothing was left for them to earn livelihood in their home district.
Tehsil municipal officer, Puran, Najeebur Rehman said collection of toll tax from the transporters was legal, as they had to run the TMA with the local revenue.
