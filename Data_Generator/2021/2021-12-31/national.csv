0,CJP urged to defer judge Ayesha Malik’s elevation to successor,"SCBA calls for changes in constitutional provisions dealing with appointment, removal of judges.","ISLAMABAD: Intensifying renewed campaign against the process of elevation of a junior judge to the apex court, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) on Thursday advised Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Gulzar Ahmed to leave the appointment’s procedure to his successor.
“It would be appropriate if the CJP may defer the matter of elevation to the Supreme Court, to be settled by the forthcoming CJP,” said a joint resolution adopted at a meeting of the SCBA which was also attended by vice chairman of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) Khushdil Khan and chairman of the PBC executive committee Mohammad Masood Chishti as special invitees.
Later talking to the media, SCBA presi­dent Mohammad Ahsan Bhoon brought into the notice of the CJP his own well-founded principle that no chief justice should commence the process of elevations to the Supreme Court if his tenure was nearing its end. The CJP will retire on Feb 1, 2022.
The SCBA, therefore, requested the CJP that since his tenure was approaching its end and he had only one month to retire, it would be appropriate if he deferred the matter to his successor, Mr Bhoon said.

SCBA calls for changes in constitutional provisions dealing with appointment, removal of judges

The meeting of the SCBA executive committee, presided over by Mr Bhoon, discussed the issue relating to the appointment of judges in the wake of a meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to be held early next week to elevate Justice Ayesha A. Malik of the Lahore High Court (LHC) as the first woman judge of the apex court.
On Dec 29, the PBC had called a meeting on Jan 3, 2022 to consider the matter of elevation of the junior judge to the apex court and chalk out a strategy.
PBC vice chairman Khushdil Khan had already written letters to the vice chairmen of the executive committees, members of the JCP from the lawyers’ side, the SCBA president and the provincial and Islamabad bar councils and high court bar associations to attend Monday’s meeting.
The SCBA meeting demanded amendments to Article 175-A of the Constitution, which deals with the procedure of appointment of judges to superior courts, and Article 209, which suggests ways to remove a superior court judge.
Mr Bhoon said that through the amendments parliament should consider merging the two forums — the JCP and the parliamentary committee — into one by empowering the body so formed to deal with appointments, elevations or removals of superior court judges.
The resolution also demanded that the composition of the JCP be reviewed and at least two representatives from the Bar bodies and equal number of representatives from the opposition parties be given representation in the commission. Representation of two Supreme Court judges — the CJP and senior puisne judge along with the attorney general and federal law minister — in the JCP was more than sufficient, it said.
Mr Bhoon said the meeting also demanded that same criteria be adopted for elevations to high courts wherein the CJP and a senior judge of respective high court would be taken on board alongside one member of the bar council concerned and one member of the PBC.
The meeting unanimously resolved that the legal fraternity did not have any personal agenda; neither they were against anyone nor in favour of anyone, rather they wanted adherence to the rule of law and the principle of seniority and, as such, nomination for elevation of the junior judge to the Supreme Court was received with displeasure and disapproved, Mr Bhoon said.
He said the meeting noted that as per past traditions, a nomination for elevation, if not approved, could not be considered twice since it gave the impression of nepotism hence it was anticipated that the CJP and the JCP would refrain from considering the name of the same judge twice and would ensure adherence to this principle.

1,"PTI, PPP women get into physical brawl in National Assembly",The two lawmakers surrounded by others were seen shouting and pushing each other.,"ISLAMABAD: Ruling PTI MNA Ghazala Saifi and Shagufta Jumani of the opposition PPP got into physical brawl during the National Assembly’s noisy sitting on Thursday.
The two lawmakers surrounded by others were seen shouting and pushing each other when the protesting opposition members had gathered in front of the seats of ministers to have a face-to-face argument at the time of the presentation of the controversial finance bill.
TV channels, while showing the footage of the incident, claimed that Ms Jumani slapped the PTI MNA after having some heated excha­nge of arguments with her.
On the other hand, the PPP members were quoted by her party colleagues as saying that in fact she was attacked by Ms Saifi and that she had only retaliated.
The members of the treasury and the opposition, however, immediately separated the two women.
Later, Ms Saifi issued a statement claiming that she had got her thumb fractured during the scuffle with Ms Jumani. “I am appalled at the way Shugafta Jumani has conducted herself. To behave in such a way, in a space which has such specific codes of ethics, a place for us to voice the concerns of the people we represent, for it to be reduced to this sort of brawl-like behaviour should be a cause of intense shame for Ms Jumani,” said the PTI member in her statement.

 



 
Ms Jumani could not be contacted for comment. However, a TV channel quoted her as saying that if someone would physically attack her, he or she would definitely face a reaction.
When contacted, PPP MNA Raja Pervez Ashraf said that Ms Jumani had come to him complaining that a PTI lady had attacked her and that she had also received a minor injury. He termed the incident unfortunate.

2,IHC reserves verdict on writs about details of SC staff,Says citizens must not be under impression that judiciary is hiding anything from them,"ISLAMABAD: The Islam­abad High Court (IHC) on Thursday reserved its judgement on identical petitions filed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Ministry of Law and Justice against the decision of the Pakistan Information Commission (PIC) for disclosure of details of the apex court’s employees.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah heard the petitions.
Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan requested the court to set aside the PIC’s order.
Initially, the Supreme Court through its registrar had filed the petition, but when Justice Minallah questioned how the Supreme Court could file the petition, the Ministry of Law came up with an identical petition.

Says citizens must not be under impression that judiciary is hiding anything from them

Justice Minallah asked the AG as to how the law ministry became aggrieved by a judgement issued for the Supreme Court.
The AG pointed out that the law ministry had in the past as well filed petitions in similar cases as it notified appointments of judges of superior courts and that was why the ministry had challenged the PIC’s order.
The IHC chief justice reminded the AG that the writ against the PIC could only be issued upon the court’s satisfaction that either the Supreme Court or the law ministry was aggrieved at the commission’s decision.
AG Khan argued that the law ministry had filed the petition with the consent of the Supreme Court’s registrar.
Justice Minallah said the apex court meant the chief justice and all other judges of the Supreme Court and asked the AG whether the decision to file the petition had been made by SC judges.
The AG replied that he did not ask the SC registrar about this.
The PIC had on July 12, 2021, allowed an application filed by one Mukhtar Ahmed seeking information about the sanctioned strength of SC staff from BS-1 to BS-22, vacant positions, daily wagers, posts created after January 1, 2017, persons with disability and transgenders working in the top court of the country.
The SC registrar had filed a review plea against the PIC’s order which was dismissed on Nov 17, 2021.
Justice Minallah told the AG that Mukhtar Ahmed had not sought any confidential information related to judges of the Supreme Court, adding that the IHC had ordered an inquiry into illegal appointments in the high court.
He remarked that citizens of the country should not be under any impression that the superior judiciary was concealing anything from them.
The AG said that had he been the registrar of the SC, he would have shared details of SC employees with the citizens.
Justice Minallah in a lighter note suggested to the AG to get the details from the SC registrar and share it with the petitioner seeking the information.

5,Tarin calls it a big day as ‘welfare state begins to take shape’,Says initially 4m households will get financial help under Kamyab Pakistan Programme,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin on Thursday said the government had laid the foundation of a welfare state to ensure that the poor did not suffer anymore and had opportunities available to them to earn a respectable livelihood for themselves.
“This is a big day, big day for the poor people,” he said while addressing a ceremony for disbursement of interest-free loans under the Kamyab Pakistan Programme.
The finance minister said initially four million households would be provided financial assistance under the programme, which would be extended to 6m and then 7m households gradually.
He said when this programme spread across the country, it would bring prosperity. “When the low-income segment of society became prosperous we can say that real Pakistan or Pakistan of the Quaid-i-Azam has been established,” he added.

Says initially 4m households will get financial help under Kamyab Pakistan Programme

Mr Tarin said the poor of the country had always been shown dreams of food, clothing, and shelter and were told that when the economy grew it would have a trickle-down effect, but even after 74 years since Pakistan came into being, this could not happen.
He said Prime Minister Imran Khan believed in Riasat-i-Madina, so he had equal focus on a growing economy, enhancing the income of upper and middle class and as well as the welfare of the poor.
The minister said the prime minister did not want the poor to wait for the trickledown effect, so he had launched this programme to enable poor people to earn respectable livelihood without hurting their self-respect. He said big banks would give wholesale loans to small and microfinance banks, which provided loans to deserving people on a retail basis.
Mr Tarin said the farmers would be provided interest-free loans of up to Rs150,000 for one crop and Rs300,000 for two crops, and Rs200,000 for tractors.
Likewise, Rs500,000 loans would be provided to a household for setting up a business, and Rs2m to Rs2.5m for building a house. In addition, Sehat cards have been provided to ensure health coverage for the poor.
The minister said this was the complete package to target the poor, adding that loans were being provided purely on merit with complete transparency irrespective of affiliations with any party, group, or tribe.
Speaking on the occasion, Founder and Chairman of Akhuwat Islamic Microfinance (AIM) Dr Amjad Saqib said that there was not any such big scheme in whole Asia that provided an interest-free loan to low-income people.
He said AIM had started loan disbursements in three categories of the Kamyab Pakistan Programme, including Kamyab Pakistan Low-Cost Housing, Kamyab Pakistan Enterprise Loan and Kamyab Pakistan Kissan Loan.

6,45 journalists killed in 2021 around globe,"Seven of the killings took place in Mexico, six each in Afghanistan and India and three in Democratic Republic of the Congo.","KARACHI: A total of 45 journalists were killed in connection with their work in the year 2021, research done by the International Press Institute (IPI) revealed on Thursday.
Seven of the killings took place in Mexico, six each in Afghanistan and India and three in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
The sombre tally reflects the continued risks of doing journalism and reaffirms journalist safety as a global challenge.
The IPI in a statement called upon the authorities to end impunity for these crimes and to ensure the protection of journalists, who must be able to do their work freely and safely.
The IPI global network published its yearly Death Watch. IPI’s research shows that since the beginning of 2021, a total of 45 journalists were killed in connection with their work, or lost their lives on assignment.
Of these 45 journalists, 40 were male and five were female.
A total of 28 were targeted due to their work, while three were killed while covering conflict, two lost their lives covering civil unrest, and one journalist was killed while on assignment. Eleven cases are still under investigation.
The Death Watch includes names of journalists who were deliberately targeted because of their profession — either because of their reporting or simply because they were journalists — as well as those who lost their lives while covering conflict or while on assignment.
IPI’s list includes journalists, editors and reporters, as well as media workers who directly contribute to news content, such as camerapersons.
IPI’s statistics are based on the organisation’s regular monitoring of attacks on journalists. In addition, IPI works closely together with its network of members and with local journalism organisations to assess whether the killing of a journalist was likely to be work-related or not.

7,"IHC urged to drop case against newspaper owner, journalists","“I verified my sources,”  Ansar Abbasi told Reporters Without Borders.","REPORTERS Without Borders (RSF) called upon the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday to drop contempt proceedings against two journalists working for The News and the newspaper’s owner for publishing a former judge’s leaked affidavit revealing alleged judicial collusion to deny bail to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam before the 2018 general election.
“I verified my sources,” Ansar Abbasi, an investigative reporter with The News, told RSF.
But Chief Justice Athar Minallah of the IHC initiated contempt of court proceedings against him, Aamir Ghauri, the newspaper’s editor, and Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman, the publisher and editor-in-chief of the Jang Group, which owns the newspaper.
The proceedings were prompted by an article, written by Mr Abbasi and published on Nov 15, claiming Rana Shamim, a former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan, had signed an affidavit stating that shortly before the general election, he heard Mian Saqib Nisar, then chief justice of Pakistan, telling a judge of the Islamabad High Court not to grant bail to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz chief.
In a written statement submitted to the court this month, Rana Shamim denied he had shared the affidavit with any one and said he “laid the entire blame” for the leak on Ansar Abbasi.
