1,"Electronic monitoring of vaccinators, registration of vaccinated children made mandatory from next month",HYDERABAD: The Sindh health department has made use of electronic monitoring of vaccination and vaccinators and...,"HYDERABAD: The Sindh health department has made use of electronic monitoring of vaccination and vaccinators and registration of vaccinated children mandatory under the immunisation outreach programme from Jan 2022, according to project director of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) Dr Irshad Memon.
He told Dawn the other day that directives to this effect had already been issued to all district health officers (DHOs). 
He said the step was taken to effectively address complaints that vaccinators shirked their job and used political clout to stay away from work.
Around 4,500 vaccinators are engaged in immunisation which covered 11 antigens until 2021. From January onwards, rubella vaccine will become part of the immunisation coverage, raising total number of antigens from 11 to 12.
“Electronic monitoring of vaccination and vaccinators’ attendance is being made mandatory in Sindh to have an effective and efficient supervision of the overall coverage,” said Dr Memon.
Sindh’s vaccinators had been on strike until recently which affected overall performance of the immunisation campaign. Still, the health authorities run the campaign with lady health workers (LHWs), who had been provided training under EPI in the past with the support of Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunisation (GAVI).
During the recent drive, it was observed that vaccinators had not been attending duties in different districts. They were tracked through a software application known as ‘Zindagi Mehfooz (ZM)’ provided by health department’s Interactive Research & Development (IRD) section.
Considering the significance of immunisation of children against polio and vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs), the EPI has made compliance of “Sindh Electronic Immunisation Registration-Zindagi Mehfooz (SEIR-ZM)” mandatory from January 2022.
It has been made compulsory upon DHOs to ensure that every EPI vaccinator working in his or her area was registered with the SEIR-ZM application, entered and synchronised attendance and coverage each day before Dec 31, 2021.
The vaccinators, who are posted for monitoring and supervisory assignments, logistics and cold chain management, including additional store in-charges as well as taluka and district superintendents of vaccination, should also be registered likewise for online attendance.
The EPI directorate said that all VPD immunisation indicators in respect of each district would be evaluated on the basis of data compiled through SEIR-ZM, besides vaccine logistics management information system.
A DHO said the application was available on smart phones of vaccinators provided by the health authorities. “But vaccinators do not usually use it and prefer manual registration,” he said. 
“From now on, they will make online entries. This will mark their attendance and vaccination of children covered in certain area,” he said.
A former EPI officer said that even if a vaccinator was out of coverage area and he had already entered the data, it would be reflected on dashboard as soon as he entered the coverage area. “This will reflect a true picture of the vaccination coverage,” he said, adding that this would also help improve vaccination coverage.
Action against 59 vaccinators
The EPI project director has directed DHOs to issue show-cause notices to 59 “absconding” vaccinators who have not been doing their duties in their respective areas.
These vaccinators were traced with the help of the ZM software during first five days of ‘enhanced outreach activity (EOA)’.
Some of the absconding vaccinators, the EPI project director said in his letter, got leaves of “unknown nature” sanctioned by their respective DHO. Some of them also got relieve orders for hiding their present position.
He advised DHOs to declare such directives for leave null and void, and issue show-cause notices to them. He asked DHOs to submit CNICs of the 59 vaccinators to the EPI directorate for further action.
According to Dr Memon, most of the vaccinators had gone on strike but now some of their demands had been accepted. Their demands pertained to sanctioning of timescale and reinstatement of 336 vaccinators who were sacked under a court directive.
Vaccinators’ performance in the EPI sector has remained questionable, according to an official of the Peoples Primary Healthcare Initiative (PPHI). During a recent strike at a crucial stage of vaccination against rubella virus, manpower support to EPI was provided by the PPHI by sparing dispensers and other staff for the purpose.
He added that vaccinators not only observed a strike recently, but they also did not work usually. “Their working remained poor and this resultantly affected immunisation and vaccination coverage,” he said.

2,Man gunned down in attack on village,LARKANA: A band of armed men stormed Himath Shaikh village in the jurisdiction of Keti Mumtaz police station on...,"LARKANA: A band of armed men stormed Himath Shaikh village in the jurisdiction of Keti Mumtaz police station on Thursday and sprayed a man with bullets before escaping reportedly to avenge murder of six men in an attack last year in riverine area of Khairpur Mir’s district. 
Police shifted the seriously injured victim Mehar Shaikh to Naudero hospital and later transported him to Chandka Medical College Hospital where he breathed his last during treatment. As soon as the attackers sneaked into Mehar’s house he woke up only to be sprayed him with bullets by the assailants, said sources in police.
“We are looking into two possible motives of the murder; revenge of six outlaws killed last year and an old feud running between two groups of Shaikh community,” said police. 
Taimor Shaikh, the victim’s uncle, alleged that sons of Mullo Shaikh and people of Narejo clan had jointly stormed the village and killed Mehar.

3,SIOVS head removed on court orders,HYDERABAD: Sindh health department has denotified Dr Khalid Talpur as executive director of the Sindh Institute of...,"HYDERABAD: Sindh health department has denotified Dr Khalid Talpur as executive director of the Sindh Institute of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences (SIOVS) in compliance of Sindh High Court’s Dec 24 order on a petition challenging his reappointment to the same post after retirement.
Dr Talpur said after his calling on Sindh Minister for Health Azra Pechuho, who met him and Dr Nazir Ashraf Leghari in Karachi a day before in the wake objections raised by serving and retired ophthalmologists of Sindh over the reappointment of Talpur, termed his meeting with the minister ‘excellent’. 
“She told me she wants me to continue as SIOVS head,” he claimed, adding it was up to Sindh health department to de-notify him in order to implement the Sindh High Court’s order.
He equated his position to that of Dr Syed Adeebul Hassan Rizvi, who headed Sindh Institute of Urology Transplantation (SIUT) despite being a retired person. 
Dr Leghari, who is vice chancellor of a private university, said that the minister promised to get an inquiry and independent audit of funding of SIOVS conducted.  
He said the government should hand back the institute to LUMHS. “She said that revision of the Act will take time but she didn’t rule out revising it altogether,” he said. 
He told her that Dr Talpur had misled her and the government to safeguard his personal interests and urged the minister to verify past and present figures of eye care being provided in the institute and when it was working as eye hospital to ascertain Dr Talpur’s claims.

4,Compliance reports on encroachments removal filed in Supreme Court,"Sindh Board of Revenue says it has so far retrieved 91pc of encroached land of forest department, 75pc of irrigation department.","KARACHI: In the light of earlier orders of the Supreme Court, the compliance reports about removal of encroachments from all government lands across the province and rehabilitation of those displaced due to the demolition drive around three nullahs of the city were filed in the apex court on Thursday.  
The Sindh Board of Revenue in its report stated that its officials along with the deputy commissioners concerned and other officers had so far retrieved 91 per cent of encroached land of forest department, 75 per cent of irrigation department and 54 per cent of land owned by other departments and agencies of the federal, provincial and local governments.  
It maintained that 84 cases had also been registered aga­inst encroachers and land-grabbers which were being vigorously pursued by the DCs concerned before tribunals while the anti-encroachment force had been placed under the command of the respective DCs for all operational and administrative purposes till the compliance of the apex court’s order passed last month.  
Another report, filed by the secretary of local government and housing and town planning department, asse­rted that in the light of apex court order passed in June, a summary regarding rehabilitation of 6,500 affected people had been approved by the chief minister as well as by the provincial cabinet.

Howe­ver, the Provincial Develo­pment Working Party (PDWP) had asked for making some minor changes in the PC-I. The Malir Devel­opment Authority has prepared a modified PC-I and the same would be placed before the PDWP in the coming week for administrative approval, it added.  
The report further maintained that after the appr­oval, the MDA would initiate the tendering process.

5,Two ‘TikTokers’ held in probe into murder of man in Malir,Police official says the other two suspects went underground to escape arrest after the investigation was started.,"KARACHI: The Malir police have arrested two teenage suspects during an investigation into the murder of a man in his 50s last week. 
Citing statements of the suspects, a senior police officer said on Thursday that they were TikTokers and, along with their two companions, were using firearms in “fun and thrill” to make videos and upload them on their social medial platforms as they would often do. 
He said the other two suspects went underground to escape arrest after the investigation was started by the law-enforcement agency.  
Giving details of the incident, an official at the Malir police station said that a man in his mid-50s, Qamar Raza, had sustained bullet wounds while he was standing outside his home in the Jafar Tayyar area last week. “He died the next day while undergoing treatment at a hospital,” he said.  
“Initially it was believed that a stray bullet had hit the victim. However, when the police started collecting evidence and recording statements of eyewitnesses, they came across the footages of a close-circuit television (CCTV) camera, installed at one of the houses in the locality, which had captured the whole episode,” he added. 
The video, he said, showed four riders on two motorbikes coming out of a street near Ghazi Chowk in Jafar Tayyar and hitting the corner of the street where Qamar Raza was standing. The riders moved away and disappeared from the frame of the CCTV camera but a few seconds later, they returned and came close to him. One of them fired a shot from a very close range from his moving two-wheeler. Mr Raza sustained the bullet in the chest, said the official. “The riders sped away leaving the wounded men in a pool of blood. He was moved to the JPMC [Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre] but died the next day,” he said. 
Malir SSP Irfan Bahadur said the police used technological support in identifying and tracing the suspects. 
“The arrested ones have been identified as Saeed Ahmed and Fazil Ali,” said SSP Bahadur. They are hardly 14 or 15 years old.

6,Sindh cabinet modifies rules for recruitment of police officers,"Search Committee Act, 2021 for VCs, varsity officers also approved.","KARACHI: The Sindh cabinet on Thursday discussed and decided recruitment rules to create police cadre in the provincial service. 
The provincial government, which had earlier gone into a deadlock with the federal government over appointment and transfer of PSP officers, in the meantime drafted recruitment rules for senior officers, from superintendent of police (BS-18) to additional IGP (BS-21).
The meeting, held under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, was attended by all provincial ministers, advisers, special assistants, acting chief secretary and other relevant officers. 
The home department suggested that the appointment against the posts of senior ranks below the rank of IG should be made in accordance with the respective recruitment rules made under the Sindh Civil Servants Act, 1973.

Search Committee Act, 2021 for VCs, varsity officers also approved

The proposed recruitment rules for different posts from grades BS-18 to BS-21 are: AIGP (BS-21); by promotion from amongst DIGs (BS-20) having a minimum of 22-year service in BS-17 and above including three years in BS-20, on seniority-cum-fitness basis, DIG (BS-20) by promotion from amongst the SSPs/AIGs (BS-19) having a minimum of 17-year service in BS-17 and above, including three years in BS-19, on seniority-cum-fitness basis; SSP/AIG (BS-19) by promotion from amongst the SSPs (BS-18) having a minimum of 12-year service in grade BS-17 and above, including three years in BS-18, on a seniority-cum-fitness basis, SP/ADIGP (BS-18) by promotion from amongst the DSPs (BS-17) having at least five -year service as such on seniority-cum-fitness basis; and SP/ADIG (legal-BS-19) by promotion from amongst the DSPs (BS-17) having at least five-year service as such on seniority-cum-fitness basis.
The cabinet was told that the Constitution and the PSP Rules 1985 did not bar the provincial government from making the subject recruitment rules nor do they suggest any concurrence from the federal government.
The cabinet was also informed that the legislative competence of ‘police’ had been declared to be in “exclusive provincial domain” by the High Court of Sindh on Sept 17, 2016 and the same attained finality at the Supreme Court. 
According to the proposal, after notifying the proposed rules, the eligible officers would be posted on their respective ranks. 
Search Committee Act
The provincial cabinet discussed and approved Search Committee Act, 2021 for appointment of vice chancellors and other officers in the public sector universities.
The committee comprising Sindh HEC chairman, secretary college education and others wo­uld prescribe recruitment criteria for vice chancellor, scrutinise and shortlist the application in the light of eligibility criteria, hold interviews of shortlisted candidates and recommend a panel of three most suitable candidates to the CM for final selection. 
The cabinet referred the bill to the assembly after its approval. 
Hiring of 1,500 internees
The cabinet decided to hire need-based intern teachers in public schools due to a shortage.
A stipend amounting to Rs50,000 per month would be allowed, subject to satisfactory performance. 
The interns would not be regularised or appointed on a contractual/ad-hoc basis. 
Incentives for EVs
A sub-committee recommended Rs1,000 registration fee for non-commercial electric vehicles (EVs) for two years as the excise & taxation department estimated that during the next five years, 100,000 electric vehicles, 500,000 two-/three-wheelers, 1,000 buses and 1,000 trucks would be plying in the country.

8,"KDA chief, officer remanded to ACE in authority misuse case",Court sees no strong evidence against suspects.,"KARACHI: An anticorruption court on Thursday remanded the director general of the Karachi Development Authority and another suspect in custody of Anti-Corruption Establishment for one day in a case pertaining to alleged misuse of authority. 
However, the court remarked that apparently, no strong evidence had been placed before it by the ACE and granted only one-day physical remand with the direction to the investigating officer to produce the suspects on Friday. 
The KDA director general, Asif Ali Memon, had complained to the Supreme Court a couple months ago during a hearing about his removal from the post hardly three months after his appointment and obtained a stay order from the Sindh High Court. He was named in an FIR along with three other officials of the KDA for allegedly not relieving them to report to the local government department after the officials were transferred and suspended. 
The IO produced the suspects before the in-charge judge of the anticorruption court for a remand and during the hearing the judge expressed resentment over the IO and the prosecutor as they could not explain the alleged offences and offer any justification to seek physical remand. 

Court sees no strong evidence against suspects

Thereafter, the court summoned the deputy director (legal) of ACE for immediate appearance in court to make a clear statement about the exact allegations against the suspects. 
Representing the KDA DG, Advocate Khawaja Shams-ul-Islam argued that the arrest was illegal as his client was framed in the case by the ACE and arrested without conducting any inquiry for not obeying the orders of the minister of local government and exposing the ‘system’. 
The counsel alleged that the chief secretary of Sindh was also harassing the DG and he had also filed an application in this regard and maintained that the chief minister was also not happy over the posting of his client and he was being allegedly victimised. 
He argued that the approval of the FIR, registration of the case and arrest was made on the same day without holding any inquiry.  
The deputy director of ACE argued that the DG did not relieve three officials of KDA despite their transfer orders and suspension and had directed them to continue their official work. 
He claimed that Mr Memon had issued illegal directives by misusing his official authority and added that they had also issued notices to the suspects asking them to record their statements. 
The court was informed that there was also an issue about transfer of a plot against the suspects. 
The judge remarked that an inquiry had to be conducted if there were allegations regarding misuse of authority and also questioned the abrupt arrest of the suspects. 
According to the FIR, the case was registered after the anti-corruption committee (ACC-I) had approved the same in its meeting held on Dec 29, as additional director of recovery Shaikh Fareed and assistant director of recovery Muhammad Zubair were transferred in October and directed to report to the LG department. 
However, it further asserted that despite transfer orders, they were still working and issuing official orders in violation of rules as the DG directed them to continue with their duties. 
The FIR said that both the officials of KDA recovery section along with another assistant director Atif Ahmed Khan were suspended and nominated along with the DG as accused in the FIR. 
Two suspects in the case are still at large. 
They were booked under Sections 162 (taking gratification, in order, by corrupt or illegal means, to influence public servant), 165 (public servant obtaining valuable thing, without consideration, from person concerned in proceeding or business), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. 
The role of other officers/officials of KDA will be determined during the course of investigation, the FIR concluded. 
It may be recalled that in October, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed had observed that Karachi’s civic agencies were powerless and officials were under fear of being transferred as the KDA DG had informed the bench that he got a stay order from the high court against his removal hardly three month after his appointment. 
Mr Memon had further informed the apex court that he assumed office on Aug 4, but he was removed from the post and an ‘OPS officer’ had replaced him, but he got a stay order from the SHC, adding that when he asked the local government minister whether he or the chief minister were unhappy with him, the minister replied that the ‘system’ was not happy over his appointment. 
The CJP had remarked that the ‘system’ was operating outside the country. 
However, the KDA DG said that some people who were part of the ‘system’ were also here.

9,16th Karachi International Book Fair gets under way,KARACHI: A five-day 16th Karachi International Book Fair (KIBF) organised by the Paki­stan Publishers and...,"KARACHI: A five-day 16th Karachi International Book Fair (KIBF) organised by the Paki­stan Publishers and Booksellers Association (PPBA) in collaboration with the Nati­onal Book Foundation (NBF) began at Expo Centre on Thursday afternoon.  
As soon as the venue was opened to the public, a big number of readers walked into the three halls (I, II, III) of the centre to get their hands on the books they wanted to read. They included people from all age groups (children, adults, elderly). And since they had a wide variety of booksellers and publishers to go to, it was not very difficult for them to find the books that they needed. 
As always, it was heartening to see children at Expo Centre. There was a family which bought books worth Rs40,000, most of them were for their young ones.  
And they came from all walks of life in society. A Grade VII St Joseph’s student, Naveera, was in search of comics and cartoon books. Sadiq, a young man from the private sector, too, was there to get colourful stuff for his children. 
Then there were the middle-aged lot. Wajih Warsi, a renowned poet and writer, is a regular visitor to the exhibition. On Thursday, he was trying to find his teacher Farooq Ahmed’s books, one of which was a collection of stories. 
The variety of books in terms of subjects that is available at the stalls is astounding. They range from religious books to children’s material and from pure literature to how-to guides. As far as literature is concerned, for some reason Yann Martel’s novel Life of Pi has a prominence presence at quite a few spaces in the exhibition (at stalls that specialise in English literature or with old books’ sellers). William Dalrymple is another author whose paperbacks are readily available. 
Another crowd favourites is the Urdu translations. Franco-Czech author Milan Kundera’s novels and his sole short story collection Laughable Loves (translated as Mazhakakhez Muhabbatein) can’t be missed at the fair. A couple of Urdu versions of the famous Arabian Nights were also being flipped through by visitors.
Earlier, addressing the audience at the inauguration ceremony (after speakers such as Anwar Maqsood, Pir Mazharul Haq and Aziz Khalid), Sindh Culture Minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah, who was the chief guest on the occasion, talked about folk Rajput wisdom, saying they (Rajputs) associated themselves [their stages in life] with important events taking place in the world. For example, someone would tell that he was 15 years of age when the Spanish flu hit the world in 1918. The minister called himself a haadisaati siyasatdan (accidental politician) but a poet at heart. His basic relationship, he claimed, is with poetry and books. 
Mr Shah said when he was studying at Mehran University, the students there used to hold book fairs as well; they would come to Karachi and request booksellers to take part in the event. Today, people read downloaded books on tablets but it, in his opinion, doesn’t come close to the pleasure of turning the page of an actual book with your fingers. “It is romance, and this romance should remain intact. I wish that a similar event [like the KIBF] is held in other cities such as Larkana and Sukkur.”

10,Call to strengthen SCSW to reduce gender-based violence,KARACHI: The Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW) hosted a consultation on the final draft of their Second...,"KARACHI: The Sindh Commission on the Status of Women (SCSW) hosted a consultation on the final draft of their Second Strategic Plan 2021-2023 in partnership with the Trust for Democratic Education and Accountability (TDEA) at a local hotel  the other day. 
The event was attended by various stakeholders including government officials, civil society and SCSW members. 
The strategic plan was drafted using a multi-tiered process to include input from various stakeholders of all levels throughout Sindh. 
In her address to the participants, SCSW chairperson Nuzhat Shirin highlighted that despite minimal financial and human resources, the commission was still able to not only follow through with its objectives in the first strategic plan but was also able to develop its second strategic plan in a timely manner with the technical help of TDEA. 
She was happy to see the response and feedback from the stakeholders present. 
Additional Chief Secretary-Home Qazi Shahid Pervez applauded the strategic plan and hailed it as a comprehensive document, which was the need of the hour and that the work of SCSW was valued by the Sindh government, which has always supported initiatives that empowers the women, girls and transgender persons. 
UNFPA Head of Office in Karachi Bayramgul Garabayeva expressed support for SCSW’s work and hoped that the two organisations could work together to fulfil the objectives outlined in the strategic plan. 
Country Representative of UN Women in Pakistan Sharmeela Rasool was also present at the consultation online. 
Participants in the consultation also urged for the strengthening of SCSW as an institution so that it can work effectively towards reducing gender-based violence.
Among the stakeholders were members of the transgender community, who expressed ownership and support for SCSW as an organisation that has always openly supported their cause. 
Due to this, they strongly felt that transgender issues should be included and highlighted explicitly in the strategic plan.
Another very important feedback received was the need to focus on climate change as it directly affects the cause of gender equality. This was met with unanimous support from all stakeholders. 
Representatives from civil society organisations from the districts in Sindh such as the Research and Development Foundation (RDF) and Arts Foundation were also present on the occasion and gave their input along with showing their support for the strategic plan.
