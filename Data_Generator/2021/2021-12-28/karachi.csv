0,One dies as Karachi receives first winter shower,"A 35-year-old man was electrocuted in Saddar area. However, KE challenged the claim and called it a natural death.","KARACHI: A man was electrocuted on Monday during the daylong light-to-moderate rain that badly hit the city’s sewerage system, severed power supply and brought the vehicular traffic movement in all metropolis districts at a snail’s pace due to inundated roads and thoroughfares. 
The downpour nullified the claims made by the federal and provincial governments about improvement in the city infrastructure that failed to brave the first shower of winter. 
Karachi remained under thick and dark clouds on Monday and different parts of the metropolis received light and moderate showers throughout the day. 
The intermittent downpour continued to play havoc with the city’s ill-maintained traffic, electricity and sewerage systems amid warning from the Met office and weather enthusiasts that the current system is “likely to stay for the next 24 hours” but would definitely weaken. 
The clouds started gathering over the city landscape late on Sunday night and finally it rained early in the morning. A few Karachi districts started receiving showers well before the sunset on Sunday. 
26mm rainfall
The weather in the city turned pleasant but cold on Monday following the rainfall the maximum of which (26mm) was recorded in the area of PAF Faisal Base by the Met department. 
According to a Met official, Monday (Dec 27, 2021) was recorded as the second warmest day in the month of December since 2008. 
“Today’s maximum temperature was 19 degrees Celsius. The warmest day in the month of December was earlier recorded in 2008 when the temperature increased to 19.6 ° C,” said Dr Sardar Sarfaraz, chief meteorologist at the Met department. 
The city of Karachi received ‘good rainfall’ in a winter month after several years, he added. 
“It’s after 2012 that Karachi received rainfall that can be described as good. It would help clean air and reduce pollutants besides improving groundwater level, filling reservoirs and benefitting farmers,” he said. 
According to him, the city will likely have fair but partially cloudy weather on Tuesday. The maximum and minimum temperature is likely to range between 24-28 ° C and 12-14 °C, respectively. 
Citing the data, he said the 24-hour highest rainfall in the month of December was 43.8mm, which was recorded in 1980. 
The rainfall data of other areas on Monday: PAF Masroor Base 18mm, Nazimabad 18.2mm, University Road/Met Complex 17mm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed 15mm, MOS (old airport area) 16.9mm, Jinnah Terminal 13.2mm, Quaidabad N/R, Orangi Town 12.5mm,Surjani Town (12.6mm) and Saadi Town 12.1mm, North Karachi 13.7mm, DHA Phase II 12mm, Kemari 12mm and Jamia-ur-Rasheed 10.4mm. 
The minimum temperature recorded in the morning was 16 °C with 90 per cent relative humidity which increased to 95pc in the evening. 
Though the rain count shared by the Met office did not suggest any major spell or heavy downpour, the brief drizzling and moderate shower led to collapse of the traffic system causing hour-long traffic jams on almost all key roads only to test the patience of commuters. 
The traffic flow that started slowing down at around 5pm turned worse by the sunset and took hours to get eased amid development works on key roads, non-functioning of several traffic signals and absence of traffic officials from some intersections. 
The traffic authorities, however, blamed accumulated water on main roads that affected the traffic pace which ultimately turned into gridlocks. They also found much larger number of vehicles on roads on Monday being the first day of the week after the two-day weekly break.
Power outages 
Within first few drops of the rain, the power supply system in the city failed to prove its effectiveness and traditionally most parts of the city remained in darkness even after hours of the outages. 
K-Electric claimed to have taken precautionary measures in several areas as an excuse for the power suspension and launched repair work in the affected areas. 
In a statement, the power utility said the areas with high incidence of theft and illegal connections usage were pre-emptively shutdown temporarily in the interest of safety of the residents and the power was swiftly restored after receiving clearance from the ground team. 
“Consumers were also kept informed about the power situation via K-Electric broadcast of live updates via its social media platforms. During the ongoing spell the maximum number of feeders switched off for safety reasons was 380 out of KE’s network of more than 1,900 feeders,” it said. 
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old man was electrocuted in Saddar area. A rescue official identified him as Ghulam Hussain who died near Frere Market. 
The KE, in its statement, challenged the claim and called it a natural death on the basis of its own investigation. 
“KE teams also proactively investigated reports of an unfortunate death incident which was reported from Frere Market Area of Saddar. Findings suggested that the death occurred because of natural causes and was not the result of electrocution,” it added.

Work to demolish 15-storey Nasla Tower under way.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star

 

SC orders FIRs against responsible officials
Attachment of plot ordered to ensure compensation 
SBCA chief issued show-cause notice
Tejori Heights builders told to pay Rs2.5m 

KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed the Karachi commissioner to complete the demolition process of the 15-storey Nasla Tower within a week and also asked the official assignee to attach the land in order to compensate the affected residents as the builders did not come forward to refund their money.
Besides taking a departmental action, the apex court also ordered police and Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) to separately register cases against owners of the building, officials concerned of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), Sindhi Muslim Cooperative Housing Society and other government departments for giving approval of such a construction in violation of the law.
A two-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed came down hard on the SBCA after the commissioner complained that the authority was trying to stop the demolition work and allegedly demanding a bribe from the contractor.
The apex court ordered the authorities to lodge an FIR against SBCA officials including its director general.
Attorney General of Pakistan Khaild Jawed Khan pointed out during the proceedings that compensation had not been paid to the affectees by the builders and suggested attachment of the allotted portion of the plot to recover the amount.
At the outset, Commissioner Iqbal Memon submitted that top five floors of Nasla Tower had been demolished and work to raze remaining floors was under way. 
Responding to a question of the court, he submitted that the five floors had been internally removed and only the outer structure was standing.
The bench, also comprising Justice Qazi Mohammad Amin Ahmed, berated the commissioner for not completing the demolition process despite the passage of sufficient time and with the strength of around 400 workers.
The commissioner in his report stated that the SBCA had attempted to stop the demolition process and demanded a bribe from the contractor tasked to demolish the building.
The report maintained that the Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (Abad) and other people including a TV reporter had also attempted to disturb the work, but they could not be able to enter the premises as they were dealt in a civilised manner while Section 144 of the criminal procedure code had already been in place.
The bench observed that any move to stop or disrupt the demolition work was amount to contempt of court and directed the commissioner to get the assistance of law enforcement agencies and complete the process in one week and file a compliance report.
When the bench confronted the DG-SBCA for creating obstructions, he denied the allegations and questioned the credibility of the report. 
However, the bench said that there was a written proof and it had made itself liable to be proceeded for commission of contempt of court and issued a show-cause notice to SBCA chief as to why contempt of court proceeding may not be initiated against him.
The court also directed the ACE to register a case against the DG and others for allegedly demanding a bribe.
The bench ordered the official assignee of the Sindh High Court to attach a portion of allotted plot measuring 780 square yards in order to compensate the affectees as the builders had not come forward for making payment and it seemed that they would not refund the residents’ money.
It further observed that the SBCA officials had violated the law and each and every official involved was liable to be not only faced departmental inquiry but also booked under the Pakistan Penal Code and Prevention of Corruption Act.
Thus, two separate FIRs be lodged against such SBCA officials and other government officials concerned at the ACE and police station concerned, the court said and directed the ACE and the DIG-Ear to file compliance reports in one week.
Initially, the apex court had ordered the demolition of the building in June for partly encroaching upon the land meant for a service road and directed the builders to refund the amount to the allotttees within three months. 
In September the review petition of the builders of Nasla Tower against the June 16 order was also turned down.
Tejori Heights
The apex court also directed the Karachi commissioner to demolish and remove the basement/foundation of Tejori Heights and the cost would be borne by the builders.
It observed that the main structure of the building had been demolished, but the structure of basement was till there as the builders seemed to be reluctant to remove the same. 
The bench sought a compliance report from the commissioner in one week and also asked the builders to provide Rs2.5 million to the commissioner in two days.
The demolished building was located near the abandoned Gilani railway station of the Karachi Circular Railway in Block 13-D, Gulshan-i-Iqbal and Pakistan Railways had claimed that the subject land had been allotted to it for KCR and the same had been encroached upon by the builders.
In October, the Supreme Court had ordered its demolition by observing that the counsel for builders of Tejori Heights remained unable to establish the ownership of the land being used for the construction of building on the plot.

2,Minister defends amendments to LG law in Sindh,"“It will be no use now if the opposition parties like to hold protests or not. Their time is nearing the end,” says minister.","SUKKUR: Sindh Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah has said that amendments to local government law of 2013, which have also included opposition’s suggestions, have in fact strengthened the law. 
“It will be no use now if the opposition parties like to hold protests or not. Their time and politics are nearing the end,” said the minister while talking to media persons after distributing laptops among students of different educational institutes at the Institute of Business Administration here the other day.
He asked PTI members as to why they did not take into account stark differences in LG laws of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when they raised objection to Sindh’s LG law. “If the local bodies law in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is so perfect then why amendments are still being made to it and assistant commissioners are being vested with powers,” he said.
He said that the PTI government would have been sent packing earlier if the Pakistan Democratic Movement had listened to PPP’s proposal of no-confidence move instead of going for long march and resignations.
It was a great tragedy in Pakistan that high profile criminals were not brought to book and that was the reason behind peoples’ lack of trust in justice system, he said, adding the case of their slain leader Benazir Bhutto  was a prime example in this regard.
He said that PPP had always preferred genuine democracy to acquiring power through backdoor because the party had a long history of sacrifices for the country and principled stand on national interest.

4,Three killed as police raid to get house vacated turns deadly,"Jauharabad SHO, raiding team taken into custody","KARACHI: A Monday morning police raid on a house in the Banaras area that led to an exchange of gunfire killing three men on the spot and leaving one policeman badly wounded turned out to be a result of a property dispute between two parties, officials and victims’ families said.
One of the parties was backed by the Jauharabad police and its SHO, who had been taken into custody, they said.
They said a team of the Jauharabar police station led by SHO Inspector Ghayyur Abbass raided a house in the Banaras area and asked its occupants to vacate the property immediately. There was a dispute over the ownership of the house between two different parties.
“The two sides are already facing each other on different forums but this time one of them used police and for that purpose brought the Jauharabad police team by using their personal connection,” said an official at the Pirabad police station. 

Jauharabad SHO, raiding team taken into custody  

“The area police were not informed by the Jauharabad police and they were unaware about the raid. Meanwhile, after the raid the situation turned tense when the occupants resisted and refused to vacate the house. This first led to a scuffle between the two sides and then intense firing began. When the guns fell silent, three occupants of the house were dead and a policeman suffered serious wounds,” he said.
The deadly incident sparked anger in the area and triggered a strong protest from the relatives and neighbours of the victims. The situation attracted attention of the area police, which reached the spot and finally facts started unfolding. 
The deceased were identified as Shabbir, Yar Gul, and Abdullah while Iftikhar and police constable Shahid suffered injuries.
“It’s a three-storey house located near Banaras in Orangi Town,” said an official. “The house was sold by one Ibrahim Shah to Saeed Khan for Rs6 million. The buyer has already made Rs2m partial payment. However, the sons and grandsons of the seller raised serious objections to the sale of the house, moved court and got a stay order.”
He said that they pasted photocopies of the order on the walls of the house in order to stop the deal. They were now living in the house and not ready to vacate the place, the official added.
Initial investigations suggested that Saeed Khan used his connection in the police and brought the Jauharabad police team for forced evacuation that led to the deadly incident, the official said, adding that further investigations were under way.
SSP-Investigation Abid Kaimkhani said that the SHO and the police team had been arrested and legal proceedings against them were under way.

5,Opposition lawmakers stage protest at SC registry,"PTI, MQM-P appeal to chief justice to take up their petitions against LG system in Sindh for hearing","KARACHI: Opposition lawmakers belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan staged a rally from the Sindh Assembly building to the Supreme Court Karachi registry in protest over the recently enacted Sindh Local Gover­nment Act (SLGA) 2021 on Monday.
The protesters requested Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed to take up their separate constitutional petitions filed against the new LG law.
Carrying banners and placards inscribed with different slogans including Kala Qanoon Na Manzoor [Black law unacceptable], the lawmakers — led by Bilal Abdul Gaffar and Kanwar Naveed Jameel, the parliamentary parties’ leaders of the PTI and MQM-P, respectively — first staged a demonstration at the Sindh Assembly building and then marched on the SC Karachi registry.

PTI, MQM-P appeal to chief justice to take up their petitions against LG system in Sindh for hearing

Speaking on the occasion, Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh termed SLGA 2013 and subsequent amendments in the act in 2021 as violation of the Constitution.
He said that the law had deprived local governments from their statuary rights and authority guaranteed under Articles 7, 8, 32 and 140-A of the Constitution.
Mr Sheikh said that both the PTI and MQM-P had filed separate constitutional petitions but these were still pending before the apex court. He said in the PTI’s petition Prime Minister and party chairman Imran Khan and secretary general Asad Umer were the petitioners.
He appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan to fix the petitions for hearing on an emergency basis and decide the cases so that local government system in Sindh could get its constitutional powers and functions.
“We as the people’s representative have gathered here in a peaceful manner without disrupting court proceedings and creating obstacles to traffic just to raise our voice against extra-constitutional steps of the Pakistan Peoples Party and to request the chief justice to fix the relevant petitions for hearing,” he said.
He alleged that the PPP in view of its majority in the provincial assembly was passing “unconstitutional laws and suppressing basic human rights of people”.
“PPP in Sindh developed an anti-judiciary narrative and their ministers, advisers and legislators were making statements in public and openly criticising orders and decisions of higher courts,” he said.
Kanwar Naveed of the MQM-P said that his party had in 2017 filed a constitutional petition against the LG law of 2013 in the Supreme Court requesting it to interpret Article 140-A of the Constitution as that article had direct relevance to the life of masses.
“The masses in the entire province are suffering due to suppressive legislation and local government are deprived of their basic functions and authority,” he said and appealed to the apex court to fix their petition for hearing.
Mr Gaffar of the PTI said that Article 140-A provided for administrative, financial and political empowerment of the third tier of the government and PTI intended to empower the local government organisations in accordance with the constitutional provisions so that people could be able to get all basic facilities.
“People of Sindh are deprived of basic civic amenities including clean drinking water, sanitation, basic health and primary education due to limited role and constrained authority of local governments,” he said and suggested that issues of people of Sindh could not be resolved till devolution of powers as well as resources at the grassroots level.

6,Army told to hand over Askari Park to KMC,"""The park was handed over to the military authorities to develop the land as a park, but it is being used commercially,"" says CJP.","KARACHI: The Supreme Court on Monday directed military authorities to hand over the possession of Askari Park to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed directed the KMC to remove all commercial activities and structures on the premises of the park and ensure that it would be fully kept for public.
The KMC in its report stated that the total area of the park was 38 acres.
A Corps V representative submitted that the park was given to the military authorities on a 99-year lease.
The chief justice remarked that it was handed over to the military authorities to develop the land as a park, but it was being used for commercial purposes.

The court also asked the civic agency to shut all commercial activities, remove structures and open them to public.
The bench also comprising Justice Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed was informed that wedding halls and 88 shops had been built on the land of the park.
Justice Ahmed asked the representative of Corps V not to involve the army in such a controversy when he attempted to argue that there was one wedding hall and that too had been closed.
The chief justice noted that the agreement of the lease had no date and even the measurement of the land was also not mentioned in it.
Earlier, an applicant had submitted that the land of the park belonged to the KMC and an agreement for adoption of such land was made between the then city district government Karachi and the military authorities in 2005 for development and maintenance of the park. 
However, the applicant said wedding halls and other commercial activities were being carried out on the premises of the park.

The agenda of the gathering was to seek the members’ approval of the last year’s proceedings and the audit report, which was done with a show of hands from the crowd. Nadeem Zafar, executive director of the ACP, moderated the event.
Speaking on the occasion, the council’s president, Ahmed Shah, said the vision that Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had for the country, that is, we should become one nation (aik qaum), is yet to be realised. Vested interests have tried to divide us on ethnic and religious grounds. [But] the artists of Pakistan (poets, writers, painters, philosophers, etc) have kept working with purity to project the country’s reputation all over the world. And yet the artist community is the least paid segment of society.
Mr Ahmed said that the council over the years had tried from its platform do its bit. “I’ve been leading this institution for the last 14 years. My colleagues include reputed artists and writers, not just from Karachi but from all the province of Sindh and the rest of the country.
Lauding the Indus Valley Civilisation, he said ours is the most significant civilisation from where traces of our liberal past can be found. Efforts were made to push us back in time but intellectuals don’t belong to the power corridors. It’s the intellectuals such as Plato, Shah Latif and Bulleh Shah who give a direction to society. “How many people know the kings of England? But everybody knows who Shakespeare is.”
After his speech, a video highlighting works that the council has undertaken in recent times was shown.
Commissioner of Karachi Iqbal Memon, who is also chairman of the APC, in his presidential address, said he’s proud to be the chairman of the council that is working to promote art and culture.
Mr Memon said language is not just a medium to communicate. It’s our entire culture and heritage. Lamenting the unfamiliarity with regional languages and Urdu, he argued that most of the people want to communicate in English. 
“This is the agenda of [of vested interests] that we are kept at a distance from our languages, our culture and our history… Recently I was abroad where I came to know that coffee was our drink which began from Tunis and was initially called qahwah. It’s do with Arab culture but now it’s called coffee. And we don’t know about it.”

Strictly advised to stay a little away from the venue — the vast space in front of the Bhuttos’ mausoleum, to avoid any hindrance in the arrangements for security, utilities and a smooth flow of vehicular traffic, at and around the mausoleum, the disciplined crowds kept raising slogans of Zindha hay Bibi zinda hay, Wazir-i-azam Bilawal, and Jeay Bhutto. On Monday, some of them were allowed to lay wreaths along with senior party leaders on the graves in the mausoleum. 
Touching scenes were witnessed inside when workers created a gloomy situation. An enthusiastic worker, Dilbar Shaikh, had travelled from Sinjhro (Sanghar) on his bicycle to attend the event. “For years, I have been visiting Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto out of love and affection to pay homage to Benazir Bhutto on her anniversaries,” the emotionally charged youth said.
The district administration and ‘mazar committee’ had jointly made extensive arrangements in collaboration with the departments concerned to ensure a smooth movement of people all along the roads leading to the venue. 
Sources in the law-enforcement agencies said about 6,800 police personnel under the command of 30 SSPs were deployed. Walkth­rough gates and CCTV cameras were installed at the entry points and every participant was allowed to enter venue of the gathering only after undergoing frisking. 
Although the management had decided not to use drone cameras, some drones were seen flying and filming the event. Also, mobile signal jammers were installed to cover an undisclosed area close to the main stage. The arriving participants were accommodated in the tents allotted district-wise separately for men and women. 
Arrangements for food distribution were made but the way it was done appeared imperfect as those who were assigned the job were seen throwing packets of cooked rice at people instead of handing them over in a systematic manner.
This time, women in a good number participated in the programme. Tri-colour caps and mufflers and portraits of the Bhutto family were displayed in the pindal and workers loved to buy them. 
Special parking arrangements were made while heavy vehicles were used divert traffic at different points. Healthcare camps were set up in the pindal to provide emergency medical cover to people while a camp for blood donation was also established. 
Fire brigade and ambulances were made available nearby.

He said that Imran Khan government’s anti-people policies had caused unprecedented rise in the prices of edibles and all essential commodities while PPP had always worked for the poor and the middle class.
He said that Soomro would soon taste shameful defeat when the process of vote recount by the returning officer concerned drew to an end.
Khudadad alias Babu said that he had rejoined the PPP because he had realised after his experience with the PTI that PPP was the only political party which truly worked for the rights of people and genuine advancement of the country.
The ceremony was attended by PPP MPAs Mir Mumtaz Hussain Jakhrani and Suhrab Khan Sarki, former MPA Mir Aurangzeb Panhwar, Sardarzada Shafqat Hussain Jakhrani, former chairman of municipal committee Asif Ali Mugheri, Mir Tahir Khan Khoso and others.
