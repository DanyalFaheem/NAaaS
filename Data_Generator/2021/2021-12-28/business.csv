0,Conditional gas supply to textile sector approved,Millers must give written assurance they would not seek stay orders for reconnection.,"ISLAMABAD: After a month-long impasse, the government on Monday conditionally agreed to provide 50 per cent gas supply to textile manufacturers for co-generation on a best effort basis provided they surrender in writing their stay orders and get their energy audits conducted. 
Energy Minister Hammad Azhar told Dawn that a government team and a delegation of All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) on Monday reached an agreement under which textile mills would be provided half of their requirement — 75 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) instead 150 mmcfd — on best effort basis. This will be supplied only to co-generation plants. 
In return, the textile millers would give in writing that they would not go for stay orders to get gas reconnection. Also, the millers would submit their energy efficiency audits and those not able to do so by June 30 would be permanently removed from gas supply. The energy efficiency audit is now mandatory for all textile mills and has to be completed by June 30, 2022. 

Millers must give written assurance they would not seek stay orders for reconnection    

Mr Azhar said the textile mills had been clearly told that their gas supply priority would, in any case, be deemed lower than ‘process gas’ (textile processes that are impossible without natural gas). The millers had separately secured stay orders against energy audits and disconnection of gas supplies. 
Amid major gas supply constraints, as the gas companies particularly Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) started gas disconnections to captive power plants (CPPs) of textile mills on Ministry of Energy’s instruction, some of the millers approached courts and secured stay orders, creating serious supply challenges. 
The energy ministry felt aggrieved by the textile industry’s attempts to protect gas supplies and subsidies through courts instead of honouring its commitments to spare gas quantities being used in CPPs while gas companies struggled to manage supplies for other priority sectors. 
The energy ministry had received an independent study from three internationally reputed organisations — The University of Chicago, The London School of Economics and Political Science and International Growth Centre — which did not comprehensively support a narrative in the country that gas and electricity subsidies had a direct link to export growth. 
The ministries of energy, finance and planning are convinced about rent-seeking and misuse in the textile sector, he said. 
The government has been providing subsidised gas and power at $6.5 per mmBtu and nine cents per kwh, respectively, for three years, but now finds it unsustainable and untargeted. It estimates the cost of annual gas subsidy at Rs65bn and Rs20bn on power subsidy, leading to circular debt build up. This is on top of other subsidies and facilitations like DTRE, TERF and DLTL schemes as well as tax exemptions. The gas rates for exports were recently increased to $9 per unit instead of $6.5 as LNG import rates surged manifold. 
About 1,870 export industries, located most in Punjab, were currently getting uninterrupted gas on SNGPL network while about 420 factories most in Sindh were on Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd network. Due to the gas crunch, about 375 factories with CPPs had been disconnected as they were running their power plants — mostly inefficient — at subsidised gas while gas for their processes was still intact. 
Officials said the subsidy was originally meant for one year to revive the export sector but was later extended for another year till June 2020 due to the challenges arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic. The textile mills had agreed to an end to the gas subsidy on June 30, 2020. 
The energy ministry is now pushing for targeted subsidies to exporters based on export proceeds. Specifically, for textile exports, it wants gas supply only for cloth-making and complete ban on gas consumption by CPPs as both the process and CPPs have separate meters.

1,Agriculture sector being transformed on priority: PM Imran,Says focus on special economic zones to set up export-oriented industries.,"ISLAMABAD: The government has chalked out a comprehensive agricultural transformation plan “for the very first time in the country’s history” and was implementing it on a priority basis, Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Monday. 
Chairing a series of meetings regarding the priority sectors, the prime minister directed the authorities concerned to take action against urea hoarders and facilitate investors in every possible way. He also emphasised the need for early completion of special economic zones (SEZs) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). 
According to Prime Minister Office, Mr Khan presided over the meetings to review progress on the implementation of the agricultural transformation plan and special economic zones. 

Says focus on SEZs to set up export-oriented industries 

During the meeting on the agriculture transformation plan, Mr Khan said the mechanisation of the agriculture sector, provision of quality seed, efficient water management system and assistance in livestock farming were transforming the sector into a high-yielding economic entity. 
With the introduction of the Kissan Card, the subsidy on fertiliser and genetic improvement of livestock, the government was aiming to achieve even higher yields as compared to the record production last year, he said. 
The meeting was informed that for disseminating quality seeds to increase the average yield and quality of the produce, relevant approvals had been taken and the release of funds was in process. For the genetic improvement of livestock, the import of quality semen was proposed and the process was expedited and given high priority. 
Moreover, to assist the livestock farmers, the 9211 helpline has been revived in Punjab while it is nearly complete in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. 
The meeting was also informed that the project to mechanise farming was near completion whereby the distribution of machinery to the farmers would start soon. This would help increase yields and cut farming costs. 
The me­eting was also briefed on olive cultivation and was informed that the import of high-yielding plants for 20,000 acres had already been started. 
On shrimp farming, the meeting was given an update about hatcheries that had been established and would soon be operational in Punjab and Balochistan. 
The meeting was also briefed on the fertiliser situation in the country, the consumption of urea and diammonium phosphate and operation against hoarders. The prime minister directed officials to take strict action against hoarders and profiteers and those involved in smuggling urea fertiliser. 
Special economic zones
During the meeting on SEZs, Prime Minister Imran Khan said the government’s focus was to increase investment in these investment zones for establishing export-oriented industries. 
He said the government’s business-friendly policies and a focus on ease of doing business had started producing positive results. 
“Increased investment of overseas Pakistanis and foreign investors is the result of the trust which the government has earned by its effective policy measures,” he added. 
The meeting was given detailed presentations on SEZs and initiatives taken by the Board of Investment (BoI), CPEC Authority and relevant ministries to facilitate investors in obtaining no-objection certificates (NOCs) and complying with different regimes — both under provincial and federal governments. 
The meeting was informed that four major SEZs — including Allama Iqbal Industrial City, Rashakai, Dhabeji and Bostan — were operational with an overall count of 21 special economic zones of different sizes. 
A one-stop-shop model for investors has been prepared by BoI to assist in the provision of basic amenities, including electricity, gas, water and construction permits. 
A unified compliance regime has also been formulated for services under the provincial and federal governments. In addition, a proposal regarding the empowerment of management companies to obtain NOCs and permits on behalf of the investors was also given.

2,Govt warns of economic risks posed by Omicron,Omicron has forced economists across the globe to cast a shadow of doubt on the ongoing global economic gro­wth recovery.,"ISLAMABAD:  The government on Monday cautioned about the impending risks of Omicron on the economy including the  concerns of the policymakers about the inflationary effects and the  resulting policy response.
Omicron has forced economists across the globe to cast a shadow of  doubt on the ongoing global economic gro­wth recovery. Pakistan’s eco­n­omy  cannot ignore the imp­e­nding risks of this spread, said Economic  Adviser’s Wing (EAW) of the Ministry of Finance in its Monthly Economic  Update & Outlook.
In its December Update, the EAW explained that  Pak­i­stan’s inflation rate is driven by the international commodity  prices, exchange rate, seasonal factors and eco­n­omic agents’  expectations concerning the future developments of these indicators.
The year-on-year increase in inflation in recent months is  mainly driven by soaring electricity charges, fuel, ho­­use rent, transport and  non-perishable food items among the largest contributors.
It is  expected that the inflation will soften month-on-month in December. International oil  prices have retreated somewhat from previous highs. The exch­ange rate  continued to slig­htly depreciate but the government efforts to dampen the  pass-through of high international food prices into domestic retail  markets is continued.
However, the low base effect may contribute to keeping the December inflation rate in double-digit. Although the forecast  probability margins are wide, most likely, year-on-year inflation is expected to  remain double-digit in December but slightly less than the previous  month’s number.
Global energy prices for November declined month-on-month by 6.4pc, while non-energy prices fell by 0.2pc.
The report noted that the fiscal  deficit fell to 1.1pc of GDP in 4MFY22 from 1.7pc  of a year ago. Similarly, the primary balance posted a surplus of  Rs206bn in July-October compared to Rs156bn in the same  period last year.
On the external side, the current account posted  a deficit of 5.3pc of GDP ($7.1bn) in 5MFY22 against a 1.6pc ($1.9bn)  surplus during the same months last year. The CAD widened due to the  growing imports of energy and  non-energy commodities, along with a rising trend in the global prices  of oil, Covid-19 vaccines, food and metals.
According to the  report, for rabi season 2021-22, the wheat crop has been cultivated on  an  area of 22.1 million acres (94.5pc of the target area of 23.3m acres). The input situation is expected to remain smooth to achieve the  wheat production target of 28.9 million tonnes. The better input  situation is expe­cted to increase crops production in the rabi season.

3,CPPA chides NTDC for Rs16bn  power sector loss,"Expresses grave concerns over the non-responsive behaviour of the company by not responding to queries raised by Nepra, others.","LAHORE:  The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) has reprimanded the National  Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) for causing a loss of Rs15.705  billion to the power sector on account of disallowed fuel cost against the  economic merit (EM) order deviation.
The agency has also expressed  grave concerns over the non-responsive behaviour of the company by not  responding to the queries/observations raised by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and others  in writing repeatedly, Dawn has learnt.
“We are writing  you in continuation of our letters (total seven from Nov 18, 2020  to Aug 10) wherein we requested NTDC to take prompt action in  respect of the fuel costs disallowed by Nepra in the power distribution  companies (Discos) fuel cost adjustment (FCA) determination due to  alleged violation of the EM order,” reads a CPPA letter  written to the NTDC managing director on Oct 21. “It is, however,  disappointing to note  that despite clear and repeated instructions of Nepra through FCA  decisions as well as requests from CPPA through a series of  correspondence referred above, the NTDC has not been able to  explain/justify the authority of the alleged violations,” it deplores.
The  CPPA, in the letter, further revealed that meanwhile a staggering  amount of Rs14.325bn had already accumulated till July 2021 as a  loss to the power sector on this account. And in the FCA determination for  September 2021, Nepra has further disallowed another Rs1.381bn  raising to Rs15.705bn.
The CPPA also told  the NTDC that the power sector is already under the huge burden of  circular debt. And therefore, no-action by the NTDC is compounding the  issue and compelling the power sector entities to adjust this amount  against NTDC’s use of system charges (UoSC) in their books of accounts.
“In  the broader interest of the power sector, we again request you to  address the observations/queries of the regulator to its satisfaction.  Your intervention in the matter would allow CPPA not to adjust the  disallowed fuel cost from NTDC’s UoSC payable by Discos,” seeks a letter  written by the CPPA’s chief financial officer. 
Nepra had also called for an explanation of the company on  Oct 13.
On the other hand, the NTDC allegedly continues taking  time to respond and ignoring the observations raised by the regulator  as well as the CPPA. However, in response to Nepra’s Oct 13  explanation notice, the NTDC in its Nov 11 letter sought two weeks to  justify its position.
The NTDC referred the Nepra’s Oct 13 notice whereby an explanation was  sought regarding the change in the stance of the NTDC/NPCC on the impact of  change in loading position of M/s Lalpir and M/s Pakgen power plants  from 20 per cent to 50pc which has allegedly led to the decision  with adverse operational and financial implications.
The NTDC complained that the authority granted it 10 days to  respond instead of the 10 working days as requested. It also told Nepra  that the response of the explanation notice is still under  consideration.
“In view of the above  facts and circumstances, it is requested that the NTDC may kindly be  granted an additional two weeks’ time for submission of reply,” seeks the NTDC  letter written by Chief Law Officer (CLO) Ghulam Nabi.
According to an  official source, the company seems to have no justification over  operation of the furnace-oil run plants, which come in last of the merit  order for operation because of generating the most costly electricity. “Why  the merit order was violated since there was no need of allowing  running of such plants at that time. It means there is something wrong  on the part of NTDC and other organisations concerned,” said the official,  requesting anonymity, calling for a high-level inquiry to punish responsible for causing this huge national loss.
The NTDC managing director was not  available for comments.
