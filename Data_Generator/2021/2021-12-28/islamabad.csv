Two PTI senators also oppose move  
Minister assures house no step to be taken that harms education sector  
Senator Ijaz Chaudhry says salaries, pensions of employees to be handled by ministry

ISLAMABAD: The voice of protesting teachers echoed in the Senate after the joint opposition expressed its resentment over the government’s move to place educational institutions in Islamabad under the purview of the mayor.
The opposition members were also joined by two key members of the treasury benches — senators Faisal Javed Khan and Kamil Ali Agha.
The federal government had recently gotten the Local Government Ordinance 2021 passed, under which the federal capital’s schools would be regulated by the yet-to-be-elected mayor instead of the education ministry.
The teaching and non-teaching employees of educational institutions run by the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) opposed the move and staged two protests outside the Parliament House and boycotted classes for one week.
The protesting teachers were of the view that running educational institutions was beyond the capacity of the local government as an amount of over Rs20 billion was required annually to manage them, adding that there was no justification to delink the FDE schools from the education ministry.
The Upper House took up the teachers’ issue on a motion jointly moved by Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Senator Mushtaq Ahmad and Kamran Murtaza of the Jamiat-i-Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), which questioned the rationale behind the decision without taking stakeholders into confidence.
PTI Senator Faisal Javed Khan sought clarification on how the vacuum thus created would be filled until the new local government started working.
Senator Kamil Ali Agha, meanwhile, termed the placing of educational institutions under the local government system a possible trick of private schools that might be eyeing about 250,000 students of government schools.
He rejected the ordinance and said if placing schools under the mayor was imperative, “let the system first start functioning and show positive results in other areas before going ahead with the decision”.
The motion’s mover, Senator Mushtaq Ahmad, said the parliament was bypassed by the government and the decision regarding educational institutions was taken through an ordinance, adding that this step reminded of the colonial area.
“How could educational institutions be placed under a municipality, that too which was yet to be formed, Mr Ahmad said, adding that, it seems, “it [government] wants to gradually privatise all educational institutions, which are running excellently”.
Kamran Murtaza requested the house to play its role to prevent the government from taking the step and save the future of 250,000 students and 14,000 teachers and non-teaching staff.
Senator Irfan Siddiqui, who is also the Senate Standing Committee on Federal Education chairman, said the government had made the education sector a laughing stock through this ordinance.
Meanwhile, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan assured the house that the government would not take any step that would prove harmful to the education system.
The matter is being discussed in standing committees of both houses and all those concerned will be taken into confidence, Mr Khan said.
PTI Senator Ijaz Chaudhry, however, clarified that the salaries and pensions of educational institutions’ employees would rest with the education ministry and not handled by the local government.

1,CDA takes Pak-EPA to court over Margalla Avenue project issue,Civic body accuses environment watchdog of creating hurdles in its work; EPA official claims no notice received from magistrate,"ISLAMABAD: The tug of war between the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Pakistan Environment Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) over the under-construction Margalla Avenue has entered into litigation phase, as the civic agency filed a case against the environment watchdog on Monday, accusing it of creating hurdles in its work.
The court of senior special magistrate, acting on an application filed by planning wing of the CDA, on Monday fixed Dec 31 for hearing the case.
CDA Magistrate Sardar Mohammad Asif issued notices to both the parties to appear before him on the date with supporting documents.
The magistrate issued a notice to Pak-EPA stating that as per CDA’s application, the agency while asking CDA to stop construction work on the road, allegedly violated CDA Ordinance’s clause 46 and 46-B.

Civic body accuses environment watchdog of creating hurdles in its work; EPA official claims no notice received from magistrate

In its plea, CDA argued that through an illegal order, the EPA directed CDA to stop construction of Margalla Avenue and while issuing the order/letter, the EPA has “relied on the incorrect interpretation of the provisions of Section 12 of Environment Protection Act, 1997”.
“It is informed that contents of the letter under reference are in contradiction to the Master Plan of Islamabad. This will hinder the implementation of the master plan of Islamabad. The master plan has approval of the federal cabinet and protected under the provisions of CDA Ordinance, 1960. The above order of EPA is an attempt to restrict CDA in implementing its legislative duty under Sections 12-15 of the ordinance”, the application stated.
A few days ago, through a notice, the CDA asked the Pak-EPA to withdraw the letter as it was contradictory to provisions of the CDA Ordinance, 1960.
“Earlier, on same alignment, a road already exists. Now within the same Right of Way (ROW), Margalla Avenue is being constructed in accordance with the original Master Plan mentioned in the Islamabad Zoning Regulations of 1992.
“It is further pointed out that proviso of Rule 4 of Islamabad Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Rules, 1983 mandates that no action will be taken which is contradictory to the Master Plan and the Authority of CDA”, the application stated, adding CDA initiated the construction of Margalla Avenue from G.T. Road to D-12, in the Phase-1, as per alignment given in the Master Plan approved by the federal cabinet in 1960.
“This road also provides access to the residential Sectors, D-12, C-13, C-14, C-15 & C-16, and Margalla Hills National Park itself”, read the application.
A few days ago, the Pak-EPA issued protection orders, directing the CDA to immediately stop the work, as it is being done without Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) while a portion of the road also falls in the limits of the national park, the Pak-EPA stated.
A CDA official, in response to the Pak-EPA’s letter stated that the civic agency has already paid a Rs1 million fine for starting work without EIA.
On the other hand, when contacted, an officer of Pak-EPA, requesting not to be named, said: “We have not received any notice of magistrate court being referred by you. When we receive it we will comment,” adding that under section 12 of EPA Act no proponent shall commence any project/construction without prior approval of EPA. Protection orders to halt construction work of Margalla Avenue was issued under section 16-1 of the Act of EPA, which allows the environment protection body to take this action, he said.
“We did nothing wrong and we will continue taking action to protect environment. As per record, the road will cross through national park and will disturb natural environment,” the officer said.

Suparco is providing the first intact knowledge about a real-time project and every four days, they were able to see ground progress of the project through this technology.
Mr Umar said a weak monitoring and evaluation system was the cause of delay and inefficiency in public sector development projects, adding that it is the reason for increase in costs and waste of taxpayers’ money as well. 
“That is why we need to revamp the overall monitoring and evaluation process. We need to have a clear idea of how this system can be used to monitor the quantitative and qualitative condition of projects. How well can these be integrated with the system,” the minister said during the meeting.
Mr Umar also discussed frequency of assessments and sought details in the next meeting of how the Planning Commission would coordinate monitoring and assessment information with future reports.

6,Jails are epicentres of crime instead of being place for reforming prisoners: IHC,Petitioner claims prison authorities involved in corrupt practices.,"ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Athar Minallah on Monday observed that instead of functioning as centres of reformation and social rehabilitation for prisoners, jails have become “epicentres of crimes, corruption and corrupt practices”.
He made these remarks while hearing a case related to maltreatment of prisoners.
A prisoner, Dr Irfan Iqbal, who has been behind bars for the past 19 years, submitted an application in the Human Rights Cell of the IHC in this regard, and his application was converted into a writ petition.
Iqbal levelled serious allegations against the inspector general of the prison and under-custody suspects claiming that these suspects were operating their land grabbing business from prison. He said they paid over Rs10 million to prison authorities, adding that influential people enjoyed all facilities in jail whereas for others, the place was no less than hell.

Petitioner claims prison authorities involved in corrupt practices

Justice Minallah noted that the assertions indicate the phenomenon of enabling the powerful and privileged to exploit the system with the support of prison authorities. While the latter exploit the system with impunity, the marginalised and vulnerable inmates become victims of grave violations of human rights, he said, adding that such a phenomenon was intolerable in a society governed under the Constitution.
Director General, Ministry of Human Rights, Mohammad Arshad informed the court that after receiving notice along with a copy of the petition, Dr Irfan Iqbal was contacted and the Punjab government was asked to arrange his medical examination.
Assertions made in the petition are being probed and a report will be prepared before the next date of hearing (Jan 12).
“It appears that the phenomenon of elite capture prevails in the prisons across the country despite the fact that an implementation commission, headed by the worthy minister for human rights, was expected to ensure treatment of the prisoners in conformity with the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution and the commitments of the State of Pakistan with the international treaties and conventions,” the court order said.
It was highlighted that the State owes a duty of care to every prisoner regardless of his or her nature of imprisonment. Most prisoners across the country are, admittedly, under-trial accused, presumed to be innocent.
“The incarcerated person loses freedom of movement but does not cease to be a human. Inhumane treatment of a prisoner is a serious violation of the constitutional rights guaranteed under Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution and the commitments of the State of Pakistan,” Justice Minallah pointed out.
The court directed the chairperson of the implementation committee and secretary, Ministry of Human Rights, to ensure forthwith that the petitioner is not harassed nor does he become a victim of reprisal for bringing to the attention of this constitutional court, the shocking and abysmal violations of human rights within the prisons of Pakistan.

7,Call to increase space for health warning on cigarette packs,"Method is cost-effective measure to create awareness about risks of smoking, experts say","ISLAMABAD: Health activists have urged the government to increase space for a health warning on cigarette packs to 70 per cent.
They were attending a press briefing, organised by the Society for Protection of Rights of the Child (Sparc).
Graphic health warnings (GHW) on cigarette packs are a proven and cost-effective measure to create mass awareness and reduce tobacco consumption, the briefing’s participants were informed.
The country representative of Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, Malik Imran, said developed countries had successfully protected their youth from smoking by introducing plain packaging of cigarette, whereas Pakistan was still under the influence of the tobacco industry. He urged the government to increase the area upon which graphic health warnings were printed on cigarette packets.

Method is cost-effective measure to create awareness about risks of smoking, experts say

Sparc Programme Manager Khalil Ahmed said according to existing law, the graphic health warning must be 60pc of the packet size. The increase in size was announced in a statutory regulatory order (SRO) in 2017.
“It is disappointing that the packet warning size in Pakistan is still less than other countries in the region. Nepal has a 95pc packet warning size, India is at 85pc while, Sri Lanka has 80pc. The graphical warning plays a vital role in deterring any potential smokers, and also reflect a country’s commitment to public health policies,” he said.
Chromatic Trust Chief Executive Officer Shariq Mahmood Khan said: “Already 1,200 children start smoking in our country daily. Health warnings are significant as they reduce the consumption rate and intent to quit smoking altogether.”
It is worth mentioning here that the graphic health warning was introduced in Pakistan in 2010 and the picture had to be changed in 2011 but could not be replaced. In January 2015, the government in a major development, issued an SRO stating that the size of GHW, on packets of cigarettes, will be increased from 40pc to 85pc and the picture would be replaced within the next five months. However, the decision could not be implemented and later the SRO was withdrawn.
According to health experts, 75pc of lung diseases are caused by smoking. More than 6.9 million people have been diagnosed with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Pakistan and it is expected that soon this will be the third leading cause of death from chronic diseases worldwide.

Farmers can be seen outside fertilizer dealers’ warehouses. They said dealers would sell urea at the official rate of Rs1,770 per bag in the presence of government officials. They would sell a load of trailer in the presence of officials and would hide other loads to be sold in the black market at inflated rates. Despite rampant complaints from farmers about the shortage of the commodity, the district administration is silent. 
Farmers alleged some dealers had also started selling fake fertilizer to make the most of the crisis. According to sources, fake fertilizers are being sold at Adda Domala Ikhlaspur, Zafarwal, and Shakargarh. 
Farmers Mahmood Ahmed and Mohammad Maqsood said that in order to get urea bags, they have to wait in long queues at warehouses. Mahmood said that his requirement was 20 bags of urea but he was provided only three bags. Farmers Muhammad Ayub and Muhammad Mustafa said that influential landlords were being supplied urea bags at their farms. 
Agriculture Assistant Director Tanveer Ahmed, however, said that urea fertilizer released to the dealers was being monitored. He said that fertilizer dealers did not get a chance to shift urea bags from trailer to warehouse as it was being sold on the spot.
