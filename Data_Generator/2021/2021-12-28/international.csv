0,UK police probe video after intruder held at Queen’s castle,LONDON: British police said on Monday they were assessing a video purportedly made by a man who tried to break into ...,"LONDON: British police said on Monday they were assessing a video purportedly made by a man who tried to break into a castle where Queen Elizabeth II was spending Christmas in which he said he wanted to kill her.
In the video, obtained by The Sun tabloid, a masked figure in a dark hoodie holding a crossbow claims he will  “attempt to assassinate Elizabeth, Queen of the Royal Family”.
The figure addresses the camera with a distorted voice and identifies himself as an Indian Sikh intent on  “revenge” for an infamous 1919 massacre of Sikhs in British-ruled India.
The video was shared on the social media platform Snapchat, around 24 minutes before a suspect was detained early on Christmas Day by armed police within the grounds of Windsor Castle, west of London.
The 19-year-old arrested is being held for mental health treatment, after officers recovered a crossbow during the brief security breach, according to London’s Metropolitan police.
“Following the man’s arrest, detectives are assessing the contents of a video,” the force said.
It has said security processes were triggered  “within moments” of the man entering the castle grounds at around 0830 GMT Saturday and that he did not enter any buildings.
The incident occurred as the Queen spent a low-key Christmas Day there with her eldest son and heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
In the video, the masked figure said he was seeking revenge for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, as it is known in India.
In April 1919, British troops fired on thousands of unarmed men, women and children in the northern city of Amritsar.
The number of casualties from the event, which galvanised support for independence, is unclear. Colonial-era records put the death toll at 379, but Indian figures put the number closer to 1,000.
“It is also revenge for those who have been killed, humiliated and discriminated on because of their race,” the figure added in the video.
He also makes several references to Star Wars during the brief address, while also predicting his own  “death is near”.
The suspect in the castle incident has been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, which allows the authorities in England and Wales to detain and treat people with mental health issues without their consent.
Those held under the legislation are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others.

1,IS-linked man executed for suicide attack  plot in Saudi Arabia,The wealthy Gulf country has been the target of a series of deadly IS shootings and bombings since late 2014.,"RIYADH: Saudi Arabia on Monday executed a Yemeni man accused of plotting a suicide attack in the kingdom and of links to the militant Islamic State group, the interior ministry said.
The wealthy Gulf country, with one of the world’s highest execution rates, has been the target of a series of deadly IS shootings and bombings since late 2014.
“Mohammed al-Saddam, a Yemeni national, sought to target civilian gatherings at a public facility under the instructions of the Daesh terrorist organisation,” the interior ministry said in a statement, referring to IS by its Arabic acronym.
“The death sentence was carried on Monday in the city of Riyadh.” It said the man had  “pledged allegiance to IS” and was planning a  “suicide attack using an explosive belt”, without elaborating on the case or when the Yemeni was arrested. The Saudi authorities could not immediately be reached for comment.
The number of executions had dropped significantly in 2020, partly due to a moratorium on executions of people sentenced to death for drug trafficking.
But Amnesty International said in August that at least 40 people were executed this year between January and July in Saudi Arabia, more than for the whole of 2020.
A total of nearly 70 people have been executed this year in the kingdom, according to a tally based on official statements.
Saudi Arabia put 184 people to death in 2019, according to Amnesty, which has said it was the highest number recorded in a single year in the country.
Earlier this year, Saudi Arabia’s state-run Human Rights Commission said it had documented 27 executions in 2020.
Last year, the HRC also announced that Saudi Arabia was abolishing court-ordered floggings, in a reform move welcomed by rights campaigners.
In November, Saudi Arabia released a man who was arrested as a minor in 2012 after nine years in prison for participating in anti-government protests.
Activists, however, are sceptical that reforms will extend to the release of political prisoners, a pause on a sweeping crackdown on dissent or an end to executions.

2,India freezes accounts of Mother Teresa’s charity,"Hindu groups vandalise statue of Jesus Christ in Haryana, disrupt Christmas celebrations in UP and Assam","NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government on Monday froze the bank accounts of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity (MoC) in West Bengal, the state’s political leader said on Monday, after weekend protests over Christmas celebrations.
Hindu vigilante groups disrupted Christmas mass in parts of India, including in Modi’s core territory ahead of local elections in the coming months.
Hardline Hindu outfits affiliated to Modi’s party have repeatedly accused the MoC of leading religious conversion programmes under the guise of charity by offering poor Hindus and tribal communities money, free education and shelter.

Hindu groups vandalise statue of Jesus Christ in Haryana, disrupt Christmas celebrations in UP and Assam

“Shocked to hear that (at) Christmas, Union Ministry FROZE ALL BANK ACCOUNTS of Mother Teresa’s Missionaries of Charity in India!” Mamata Banerjee, the state’s chief minister, wrote in a tweet.
“Their 22,000 patients & employees have been left without food & medicines. While the law is paramount, humanitarian efforts must not be compromised,” Banerjee, an opposition leader and vocal critic of the Modi government, said.
Nobel-laureate Mother Teresa, a Roman Catholic nun who died in 1997, founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950.
Head-quartered in the eastern state of West Bengal, the MoC has more than 3,000 nuns worldwide who run hospices, community kitchens, schools, leper colonies and homes for abandoned children.
Officials at MoC were not immediately available for comment, while the federal home ministry said the government will issue a statement once an initial inquiry is completed.
“I urge the press to not mix financial irregularities of a charity group with religious sentiments...the decision to freeze accounts has nothing to do with Christianity,” an official said, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
Vicar General Dominic Gomes of the Archdiocese of Calcutta said the freeze of the West Bengal accounts was  “a cruel Christmas gift to the poorest of the poor”.
Since Modi came to power in 2014, right-wing Hindu groups have consolidated their position across states and launched small-scale attacks on religious minorities, saying their action is to prevent religious conversions.
Christians and other critics say the justification of preventing conversions is false and note Christians represent only 2.3pc of India’s 1.37 billion people, while Hindus are the overwhelming majority.
The Hindu newspaper on Monday reported disruption of Christmas celebrations at the weekend and last week, including the vandalising of a life-size statue of Jesus Christ at Ambala in Haryana, a northern state governed by Modi’s nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
It also reported activists burnt a model of Santa Claus and chanted slogans against Christmas celebrations and religious conversions on Saturday outside a church in Varanasi, Modi’s parliamentary constituency and Hinduism’s holiest city.

On Saturday, Christmas celebrations were also disrupted in Silchar, eastern Assam, after men, claiming to be members of Bajrang Dal — a right-wing group with close ties to BJP, forced their way into a church, NDTV, a local news channel reported.Several Indian states have passed or are considering anti-conversion laws that challenge freedom of belief and related rights that the Indian constitution guarantees to minorities. Elias Vaz, national vice-president of the All India Catholic Union, condemned the latest incidents.
“The strength of India is in its diversity and the people who have done this at Christmas are the real anti-nationals,” Vaz said.

3,Putin concerned over security situation at Afghan-Tajik border,Moscow has sought to mitigate the risk by strengthening its military base in Tajikistan with weapons and other equipment.,"MOSCOW: The security situation at the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border is a concern, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday, a risk Moscow has sought to mitigate by strengthening its military base in Tajikistan with weapons and other equipment.
The possibility of Islamist militants in Afghanistan infiltrating Tajikistan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia is a worry for Moscow, which views the region as a defensive buffer to its south.
Russia this month said it was reinforcing its military base in Tajikistan with 30 new tanks and that its forces there had carried out exercises with missile defence systems.

4,Myanmar court postpones verdicts in second case against Suu Kyi,The court gave no reason for delaying the verdicts until January 10.,"BANGKOK: A court in military-ruled Myanmar postponed its verdicts on Monday on two charges against ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi in which she is accused of importing and possessing walkie-talkies without following official procedures, a legal official familiar with the case said.
The case in the court in the capital, Naypyitaw, is among many brought against the 76-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate since the army seized power on Feb 1, ousting her elected government and arresting top members of her National League for Democracy party.
The court gave no reason for delaying the verdicts until Jan 10, according to the legal official, who have restricted the release of information about Suu Kyis trials.
Suu Kyi’s party won a landslide victory in last years general election, but the military said there was widespread electoral fraud, an assertion that independent poll watchers doubt.
Suu Kyi’s supporters and independent analysts say all the charges against her are politically motivated and an attempt to discredit her and legitimise the military’s seizure of power while keeping her from returning to politics. If found guilty of all the charges she faces, she could be sentenced to more than 100 years in prison.
Suu Kyi was convicted on Dec 6 on two other charges incitement and breaching Covid-19 restrictions and sentenced to four years imprisonment. Hours after the sentence was issued, the head of the military-installed government, Senior Gen Min Aung Hlaing, reduced it by half. She is being held by the military at an unknown location and state television reported that she would serve her sentence there.
Suu Kyi has been attending court hearings in prison clothes a white top and a brown longyi skirt provided by the authorities. The hearings are closed to the media and spectators and the prosecutors do not comment. 
Her lawyers, who had been a source of information on the proceedings, were served with gag orders in October.
A charge under the Export-Import Law of having improperly imported the walkies-talkies was the first filed against Suu Kyi and served as the initial justification for her continued detention. A second charge of illegally possessing the radios was filed the following month.
The radios were seized from the gate of her residence and the barracks of her bodyguards during a search on Feb 1, the day she was arrested.
Suu Kyi’s lawyers argued that the radios were not in her personal possession and were legitimately used to help provide for her security, but the court declined to dismiss the charges.
The court on Monday also heard video testimony from the vice chairman of Suu Kyi’s party, Zaw Myint Maung, in another case against her involving alleged violation of Covid-19 restrictions during last year’s election campaign, the legal official said.
Zaw Myint Maung, who had been unable to appear in court earlier for health reasons, testified that people had gathered to see her when she visited Shwe Kyar Pin Ward during the campaign because they respect her, and it wasn’t a violation of virus restrictions, the official said.
The offense falls under the Natural Disaster Management Law and the maximum penalty is three years in prison and a fine.

5,Heavy snow causes travel chaos in Japan,"More than 3,200 households have been left without power in the region, according to Kansai Electric Power.","TOKYO: Heavy snow caused traffic jams, flight cancellations and disruption to train services in central Japan on Monday, with record drifts recorded in some areas.
More than 3,200 households have been left without power in the region, according to Kansai Electric Power, as officials warned more snow was forecast overnight.
No injuries or deaths due to the freezing weather have yet been confirmed, government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno said.
“A strong winter pressure pattern is causing heavy snow, mainly along the Sea of Japan side of the country from northern to western Japan, with some areas experiencing record snowfall,” Matsuno said.
“The amount of snow is expected to increase tomorrow... increased caution and vigilance are still required.” A major road in the Shiga region was closed  “due to stranded vehicles”, Matsuno said, with TV footage showing long lines of stationary cars that later began to move.
The traffic snarl-up reportedly began when a truck slipped near Hikone city, where 68 centimetres (26 inches) of snow fell in 24 hours to this morning — 30 times deeper than average — according to public broadcaster NHK.
Nearly 200 passengers were snowed in overnight on a local train line in the region, NHK said. One picture from a train carriage posted on Twitter showed a huge pile of fresh powder between two open doors as a station lamp illuminated snowflakes against the night sky.
Around 130 domestic flights were cancelled on Sunday due to the snow, Jiji Press said, with NHK reporting some 50 cancellations on Monday.

6,"Feuding Somali president, PM land nation in chaos","Relations between the pair have long been frosty, but the latest verbal broadsides stoke fears for Somalia’s stability.","MOGADISHU: A long-running political crisis in Somalia escalated on Monday as the president suspended the prime minister, who blasted the move as an  “attempted coup” and asked the armed forces to follow his orders.
The angry exchange came a day after President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who is better known as Farmajo, sparred with Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble over the country’s sluggish preparations for elections.
Relations between the pair have long been frosty, but the latest verbal broadsides stoke fears for Somalia’s stability as the country struggles to stage elections and fight a jihadist insurgency.
Farmajo’s office on Monday announced the president had  “decided to suspend Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble and stop his powers since he was linked with corruption,” accusing him of interfering with a probe into a land-grabbing case.
Roble hit back, accusing Farmajo of attempting to carry out  “a coup against the government, the constitution, and the rules of the country.”  “As the president has seemingly decided to destroy government institutions... I order all Somali national forces to work under the command of the office of the prime minister from today”, Roble told a press conference.
Despite a heightened military presence around the prime minister’s office, Roble was still able to enter the premises, a day after Farmajo withdrew his mandate to organise the elections and called for the creation of a new committee to  “correct” the shortcomings.
The two men have traded accusations in recent days, with Roble alleging that Farmajo did not want to hold  “a credible election”.
Farmajo in turn has accused Roble of trying to influence a probe into a scandal involving army-owned land after the premier sacked the defence minister and replaced him on Sunday.
“The prime minister has pressurised the minister of defence to divert the investigations of the case relating to the grabbed public land,” Monday’s statement by Farmajo’s office said.
US ‘deeply concerned’
The dispute alarmed international observers, prompting the US embassy in Mogadishu to urge Somalia’s leaders  “to take immediate steps to de-escalate tensions... refrain from provocative actions, and avoid violence.” Somalia’s elections have been hampered by delays for several months.
In April, pro-government and opposition fighters opened fire in the streets of Mogadishu after Farmajo extended his term without holding fresh elections.
The constitutional crisis was only defused when Farmajo reversed the term extension and Roble brokered a timetable to a vote.
But in the months that followed, a bitter rivalry between the men derailed the election again.
Farmajo and Roble only agreed to bury the hatchet in October, and issued a unified call for the glacial election process to accelerate.
Somalia’s elections follow a complex indirect model. Nearly 30,000 clan delegates are assigned to choose 275 MPs for the lower house while five state legislatures elect senators for the upper house. Both houses of parliament then vote for the next president.

7,Sociobiology pioneer E.O.Wilson dies,"WASHINGTON: Edward. O. Wilson, the trailblazing US scientist, professor and author whose study of insects and ...","WASHINGTON: Edward. O. Wilson, the trailblazing US scientist, professor and author whose study of insects and clarion call to protect Earth earned him the nickname  “Darwin’s natural heir,” has died at age 92.
Wilson, whose death was announced on Monday by his foundation, was an award-winning biologist and longtime Harvard University research professor, considered the world’s leading authority on ants and their behavior.
While an entomologist early in his career, he broadened his scope immensely, studying not just insects but the social interactions of birds, mammals and humans, and he effectively — and controversially — established a new field of science known as sociobiology.
He was the author of hundreds of scientific papers and more than 30 books, two of which won him Pulitzer Prizes for nonfiction: 1978’s  “On Human Nature,” and  “The Ants” in 1990.
“Ed’s holy grail was the sheer delight of the pursuit of knowledge,” said Paula Ehrlich, president of the E. O. Wilson Biodiversity Foundation and co-founder of the Half-Earth Project.
“A relentless synthesizer of ideas, his courageous scientific focus and poetic voice transformed our way of understanding ourselves and our planet.
“His greatest hope was that students everywhere share his passion for discovery as the ultimate scientific foundation for future stewardship of our planet.” Wilson, who died on Sunday in Massachusetts, had become renowned for his advances in global conservation, and advised preeminent scientific and conservation organisations.
Time magazine two decades ago described him as having  “one of the great careers in 20th century science,” as it highlighted his work mapping the social behavior of ants and proving their colonies communicate through a system of chemicals known today as pheromones.

8,Sri Lanka shuts three foreign missions as dollar crisis worsens,The closure comes on the same day the central bank tightened restrictions on foreign currency remittances received by locals.,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka announced on Monday the closure of three overseas diplomatic missions in a bid to save foreign currency reserves, as the country’s central bank slapped tighter controls on dollars needed to finance essential imports.
The Sri Lankan High Commission (embassy) in Nigeria and consulates in Germany and Cyprus will be closed from January in the restructuring, the foreign ministry said.
“The restructuring is undertaken with a view to conserving the country’s much needed foreign reserves and minimising expenditure related to maintenance of Sri Lanka’s missions overseas,” the ministry said in a statement.
The island’s tourism-dependent economy was hammered by the pandemic and the government in March last year imposed a broad import ban to shore up forex reserves, triggering shortages of essential goods such as fuel and sugar.
The closure of the three missions came on the same day the Central Bank of Sri Lanka tightened restrictions on foreign currency remittances received by locals.
It ordered all commercial banks to hand over a quarter of their dollar earnings to the government, up from 10 percent.
This means banks will have even fewer dollars to give to private traders who are importing essential goods.
Sri Lanka had foreign reserves of just $1.58 billion at the end of November, down from $7.5 billion when President Gotabaya Rajapaksa took office in 2019.
The central bank has appealed for foreign currency — even the loose change of people returning from overseas trips.
Earlier this month, ratings agency Fitch downgraded Sri Lanka due to mounting fears of a sovereign default on its $26 billion foreign debt. The government insisted it can meet its obligations.
Food shortages have been worsened by the government’s ban on agrochemical imports, which was lifted last month after widespread crop failures and intense farmer protests.

9,Omicron spreads gloom over New Year’s celebrations,"BRUSSELS: After struggling with the coronavirus for far too long, the world understands all too well Belgium’s ...","BRUSSELS: After struggling with the coronavirus for far too long, the world understands all too well Belgium’s word of the year, knaldrang! the urge to party, the need to let loose. Yet as New Year celebrations approach, the omicron variant is casting more gloom.
Several countries are considering more restrictions to add to the patchwork of lockdowns and other measures already in place around Europe.
And the top US infectious-disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, warned on Monday that with the rise of the highly contagious omicron, “it is going to get worse before it gets better”.
“We don’t expect things are going to turn around in a few days to a week. It likely will take much longer than that, but that is unpredictable,” he said on ABC.
It is the unpredictability that is keeping governments second-guessing and picking widely varying strategies to beat back the pandemic. The French government and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson were assessing the latest data and the need to counter the record numbers of Covid-19 infections with more measures to keep people apart at a time when they so dearly want to be together.
But with indications that omicron might be a milder variant despite its extraordinary ability to infect people, politicians were caught in a bind over whether to spoil yet another party or play it safe to make sure health care systems don’t collapse.
Further complicating matters was the lack of full data over the Christmas weekend, which made it more difficult to chart omicron’s course.
In Belgium, people faced their first real test with several new measures on Monday. Shopping in large groups was banned, and movie theaters and concert halls closed at a time when countless families are on vacation together.
The calls to close theaters and arts centers came in for especially heavy criticism.
“We need it also for our mental health. It is the only way for people to live experiences, to tell stories. It is of paramount importance for us to be open in these complicated and complex times, said Michael De Kok, artistic director of the Flemish Royal Theatre.

Spider-Man: No Way Home, British star Tom Holland’s third solo outing in the wildly popular role, has grossed $467.3 million in North America and $587 million internationally, raking in more than $1 billion over 12 days and proving analysts’ predictions that it could reach the milestone sum.
It rocketed to that benchmark at a speed only matched by 2015’s  “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” according to industry outlet Variety, and comes even as the rapid spread of the Omicron Covid-19 variant casts a pall over holiday outings worldwide.
Sony’s latest installment to the comic-inspired series took an estimated $81.5 million in North America for the three-day period over the Christmas weekend, holding its top spot after scoring the third-biggest domestic opening of all time with more than $260 million, smashing early estimates.

11,Iraq’s court rejects pro-Iran group’s appeal against election results,The ratification follows a delay of more than two months since the October 10 legislative polls won by Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr.,"BAGHDAD: Iraq’s top court on Monday ratified the country’s October parliamentary election results after rejecting a complaint of irregularities filed by the pro-Iran Hashed al-Shaabi former paramilitary alliance.
The long-awaited ruling will allow parliament to meet and pave the way for the election of a president who will then appoint a prime minister tasked with forming a new government.
Iraq is trying to recover from years of war and jihadist violence but remains hobbled by political divisions, corruption and poverty.
The ratification follows a delay of more than two months since the October 10 legislative polls won by Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr, a political maverick and former anti-US militia leader who opposes all foreign interference.
Sadr’s movement won more than a fifth of the seats — 73 out of the assembly’s total 329, well ahead of the 17 seats of the Fatah (Conquest) Alliance, the political arm of the pro-Iran Hashed.
That was sharply down from the Alliance’s 48 seats in the outgoing assembly. Hashed leaders rejected the result as a  “fraud”.
They took their case to court seeking  “to have the results annulled” because of  “serious violations”, their lawyer said earlier in December when the hearing began.
Judge Jassem Mohamed Aboud of the Federal Supreme Court on Monday said the tribunal  “rejects the request of the plaintiffs... not to ratify the final results of the election”.
He declared the judgment  “binding on all authorities”.
Later the court media officer announced that the body  “has ratified the results of the legislative elections”.
The Hashed had also organised protests over the preliminary election results. Political tensions soared, and in November at least one protester was killed and more than 100 injured when police clashed with demonstrators.
The Fatah Alliance alleged the electronic voting system had failed to recognise the fingerprint identification of many voters.
On Monday, Fatah Alliance leader Hadi al-Ameri reiterated  “the profound conviction that the electoral process was tainted by fraud and manipulations.” He said he would accept the court’s verdict but accused it of coming under  “heavy pressure.” Iraqi analyst Ihsan al-Shamari said that was not the case.
“The most important thing about the verdict is that the judiciary did not bow to pressure from the losing parties,” he said.
Judge Aboud, reading out the verdict, said the court also decided to make the plaintiffs bear the costs of the appeal.
In multi-confessional and multi-ethnic Iraq, the formation of governments has involved complex negotiations ever since the 2003 US-led invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein.
The prime minister tasked with forming a cabinet line-up will be, according to tradition, chosen by the largest parliamentary coalition.
Sadr, a self-styled defender against all forms of corruption, has repeatedly said that the next prime minister will be chosen by his movement.
He has also demanded that the new government include members of political parties and blocs which scored highly in the October polls.
The scion of an influential clerical family who led a militia against the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, has distinguished himself from other Shia factions by seeking to distance himself from both Iranian and US influences.
The Hashed alliance which helped defeat the militant Islamic State group holds opposing views.
It has said that the choice of a new prime minister should be made through compromise.
Backed by Iran and supported by 160,000 fighters who are now integrated into the regular armed forces of Iraq, the alliance remains a force to be reckoned with despite its losses in the October vote.
Aboud said the new parliament should amend Iraq’s electoral law and opt for a manual count of ballots in order to protect the credibility and transparency of future elections.
