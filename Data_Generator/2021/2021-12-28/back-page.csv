0,"Retrogressive approach a danger for Pakistan, warns minister",Says Imran making efforts to reclaim Quaid’s Pakistan,"ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said on Monday retrogressive thinking was a “danger for Pakistan” in reference to the recent measures taken by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan regarding women. 
“You see that two extremist regimes have cropped up on the right and left of Pakistan. On one side there is Afghanistan where the Taliban have arrived. We want to fully help the Afghan people. 
“But saying that women can’t travel alone or go to schools and colleges — this kind of retrogressive thinking is a danger for Pakistan,” the information minister said, while speaking to the participants of a photo exhibition on the life of Quaid-i-Azam at Pak-China Friendship Centre in Islamabad. 
Since a similar Hindu extremist mindset was rising in India, the Pakistani state’s “biggest” and “most important” fight was against these “two extremist thoughts”, he was quoted as saying by Dawn.com. “We have had failures and successes, but till now Pakistan is that bright hope in this region which while remaining amid these extremes can emerge out from them.” 

Says Imran making efforts to reclaim Quaid’s Pakistan 

The minister’s comments come after Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said on Sunday that women seeking to travel longer distances should not be offered transport unless they are accompanied by a close male relative. 
The guidance, issued by the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, also called on all vehicle owners to offer rides only to those women who wear hijab. 
Since taking power in August, the Taliban have imposed various restrictions on women and girls, despite pledging a softer rule compared to their first stint in power in the 1990s. 
Mr Chaudhry said Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah did not want a religious state and Prime Minister Imran Khan was making efforts to reclaim the Quaid’s Pakistan.   
He said the major challenge was to reclaim the Quaid’s Pakistan and stay away from the influence of neighbouring extremist states.   
“An article has been published recently in Bangladesh in which it has been claimed that the Quaid did not know what kind of Pakistan will come into being. It is not correct; three speeches of the Quaid — one on 11th August [1947], an address to the armed forces and another to bureaucracy — made it clear what kind of Pakistan he [Quaid] wanted,” he pointed out.   
“Quaid did not want a religious state and Islamic country does not mean a religious country. Quaid’s lifestyle did not match with today’s religious leaders; he was a modern and forward-looking human being,” he added.   
The minister said the Quaid knew that Hindus were in the majority in India and it would become difficult for Muslims to live there freely and it had now been proved during the regime of [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi.   
“The New York Times has published a front-page story that in India Christians were stopped from celebrating Christmas. In Pakistan the lynching of a person [Sri Lankan factory manager Priyantha Kumara in Sialkot] was done but whole Pakistan got united against the incident. In India, no one speaks against such incidents. The idea behind the creation of Pakistan was to protect the rights of minorities,” he said.   
Mr Chaudhry said the Quaid had on August 10 [1947] directed that religious parts be removed from the oath so that minority members could also take the oath.   
“The Quaid never thought of making Pakistan a religious state. Had it been correct, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and other religious leaders would have led the Pakistan Movement. The Quaid interpreted Islam politically.”    
The minister said India was facing a decline because of religious extremism, but the Quaid had categorically stated that Pakistan would not be a religious country and those who didn’t want to understand that were at fault.  
He said the reason for making the nation-state of Pakistan was for a place where Muslims could have a majority where their rights would be preserved and they would not be hostage to a majority. He stressed that Pakistan’s purpose was “preserving minority rights and safeguarding them”. 
“Our real challenge is how to reclaim Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s Pakistan,” he emphasised. 
The Quaid had clarified the role of minorities and that the state would have no business to interfere in religious matters. “[However] after that, a great retrogressive [thinking] has come and we see Pakistan has declined.” 
“This fight is very important for Pakistan’s survival and only by winning it can we or any other country move forward.” 
Mr Chaudhry said a movement was needed to effectively propagate Jinnah’s message and understanding of Pakistan to the common people.

2,US waives in-person interviews for some visas,State Department says the move aims to shorten visa wait times.,"WASHINGTON: The new US policy of waiving in-person interviews for certain non-immigrant visa applicants becomes operative from Friday, the State Department said.
The department said the move aims at reducing visa wait times as in some places applicants have to wait for more than a year to get an interview date.
“The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in profound reductions in the department’s visa processing capacity,” it said in a statement. 
“As global travel rebounds, we are taking these temporary steps to further our commitment to safely and efficiently reduce visa wait times while maintaining national security as our priority.”

State Department says the move aims to shorten visa wait times

From Friday, US consular officers will have the temporary authority to waive in-person interviews for nearly a dozen visa categories, including Persons in Specialty Occupations (H-1B visas), visas for students, temporary agricultural and non-agricultural workers, student exchange visitors, as well as athletes, artists and entertainers.
The department said it recognised the positive impact of temporary work visa holders on the US economy and was committed to facilitating nonimmigrant travel and reducing visa wait times.
“We are pleased to announce that consular officers are now temporarily authorised, through December 31, 2022, to waive in-person interviews for certain individual petition-based nonimmigrant work visas and their qualifying derivatives.”
The authorisation to waive the in-person interview for applicants renewing a visa in the same visa class within 48 months of the prior visa’s expiration has also been extended indefinitely.
US embassies and consulates may still require an in-person interview on a case-by-case basis and dependent upon local conditions.
Applicants are encouraged to check embassy and consulate websites for more information about this development, as well as current operating status and services.

3,UAE issues first civil marriage licence for non-Muslim couple,The country has been amending its laws to present itself as a modernising force in a largely conservative region.,"ABU DHABI: The UAE issued its first civil marriage licence for a non-Muslim couple, state media reported on Monday, as the Gulf country seeks to keep its edge over regional competitors. 
The United Arab Emirates — where foreigners make up 90 per cent of the approximately 10 million population — has been amending its laws to present itself as a modernising force in a largely conservative region. 
The official WAM news agency said a Canadian couple were the first to marry under a new law on the personal status of non-Muslims in the Emirati capital Abu Dhabi. The move “contributes to the consolidation of Abu Dhabi’s position as a world leading destination for skills and expertise from around the world,” WAM said. 
Civil marriage in the Middle East, the birthplace of Islam, Christianity and Judaism, is uncommon and usually conducted under a religious authority of one of the three monotheistic beliefs. 
Civil marriages are allowed in Tunisia and Algeria. 
While some countries in the region allow civil unions based on certain conditions, some only recognise civil marriages conducted abroad and others not at all. Late last year, the UAE revamped an array of laws in a social liberalisation drive designed to burnish its progressive brand. 
These included lifting a ban on unmarried couples living together, loosening restrictions on alcohol and offering long-term residencies. 
Earlier this month, the UAE announced it will move to a Western-style Saturday-Sunday weekend. 
Starting on January 1, 2022, the Emirates will become the only Gulf country not to observe weekends from Friday, the Muslim day of prayer, to Saturday.
