0,"IPC Ministry, PFF NC agree on eight-month roadmap for elections","A formal announcement will be announced soon, once IPC minister Dr Fehmida Mirza returns from her leave.","LAHORE: The Ministry of Inter-provincial Coordination and the Pakistan Football Federation Normalisation Committee have agreed in principle upon the roadmap presented by the latter to complete the election process of the country’s football governing body in eight months’ time after it is handed over the PFF headquarters, sources privy to the talks told Dawn on Monday. 
A formal announcement in that regard will be announced soon, once IPC minister Dr Fehmida Mirza returns from her leave. Sources said that Dr Mirza is currently on leave till Jan 7 due to her brother’s illness but could resume office as soon as her brother’s health improves. 
The roadmap was a major demand from the IPC ministry as it looks to speed up the resolution of the long-running dispute in the PFF, which was further exacerbated when the country suspended by global football body FIFA in April after the PFF headquarters were taken over from the NC by the court-elected PFF of Ashfaq Hussain Shah. 
Ashfaq, who became PFF president in elections held by the Supreme Court in December 2018 — which were not recognised by FIFA, had said upon the takeover that his group of officials had lost faith in the NC, which had been appointed by FIFA in September 2019 but was not close to holding the elections. 
Ashfaq’s PFF was forced to vacate the PFF headquarters last month after what initially emerged as a dispute over non-payment of its three year lease to the Punjab government. Developments since have pointed towards a cancellation of the lease after the previous PFF had entered into a subletting agreement with another company. 
But with the federal government eager to get the FIFA suspension lifted, things are expected to be sorted out especially with the election roadmap having been agreed upon. 
According to sources, the NC has asked two months to conduct club scrutiny via the FIFA Connect programme. 
After 15 days, the district elections would be held with another one and half months required to complete the elections at provincial level. 
There will be another two months before the presidential election is held. 
“Constitutionally, the election process is four and half months,” said the source, adding that the PFF NC had sought a further month to hand over charge to the elected body while there is a 15-day cushion period.  
The source added that appeals and disciplinary committees will be formed to ensure that the election process is not subject to litigation, which has been a common feature in elections in the past.

1,Rublev’s Australian Open prep disrupted by positive test,PARIS: Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev became the latest player to have played in an Abu Dhabi exhibition...,"PARIS: Russian tennis star Andrey Rublev became the latest player to have played in an Abu Dhabi exhibition tournament earlier this month to test positive for Covid-19 just weeks away from the Australian Open. 
The world number five, who beat Andy Murray in the World Tennis Championship final on Dec 18, tweeted he was self-isolating which places in doubt his competing in the ATP Cup (Jan 1-9) in Australia. 
Rublev was part of the Russian team that won the ATP Cup this year and had been included in the team for the upcoming edition in Sydney, which kicks off on Saturday. 
The Australian Open — where Rublev reached the quarter-finals this year — runs from January 17 to 30 in Melbourne. 
“I am currently in Barcelona and unfortunately I have tested positive for Covid-19,” said Rublev on Twitter. “I have minimal symptoms. I am isolating and respecting all the protocols under the supervision of the doctors. 
“As you know I am completely vaccinated and I was preparing for the ATP Cup and Australian Open. Now I have to recover and I will go to Melbourne only when I am certain it is safe for everyone. 
“I am very upset and concerned about what is happening. Please, take care of yourself and of the people around you. I will return to the court as soon as possible.” 
Rublev is the third male player to have played in Abu Dhabi to test positive for Covid. 
Canada’s Wimbledon semi-finalist Denis Shapovalov tested positive on arrival in Australia and former world number one Rafael Nadal did as well on returning to Spain. 
Nadal’s coach Carlos Moya also tested positive. 
Three female players who were in Abu Dhabi tested positive — Switzerland’s Olympic champion Belinda Bencic and Tunisian Ons Jabeur all tested positive after taking part in the event while US Open champion Emma Raducanu tested positive before the event and withdrew.

2,England’s Ashes fate in balance after Covid scare in Melbourne,MELBOURNE: Australia moved within tantalising reach of retaining the Ashes in Melbourne on Monday but the fate of ...,"MELBOURNE: Australia moved within tantalising reach of retaining the Ashes in Melbourne on Monday but the fate of the series may be decided in a laboratory rather than on the field after the England camp was hit by a rash of Covid-19 cases.  
Two England support staff and two of their family members were in isolation after testing positive for Covid-19, throwing a scare through the team as they prepared to head to the Melbourne Cricket Ground for day two of the third Test.  
The players were all cleared after rapid antigen tests and play proceeded without disruption barring a half-hour delay.  
However, England will need to wait for the results from more thorough PCR tests to be clear to return for day three on Tuesday, which they do not expect to receive until morning.  
Under ICC rules, teams are allowed to make replacements for players ruled out by Covid-19 with the match referee’s approval, so long as the substitutes are considered “like-for-like” and would not provide undue advantage.  
An England team spokesman said it was still to be decided how the match would proceed if there was a positive Covid-19 case among the players.  
It was also unclear whether players would be deemed close contacts of any infected team mates and be forced to isolate.  
The Covid tension added to a deflating final session on Monday for England, who were staring down the barrel of another heavy defeat following losses in Brisbane and Adelaide.  
Australia were bowled out for 267 as the home side grabbed a first-innings advantage of 82 runs, before England reached 31-4 in their second innings at stumps on Monday.  
“We actually got on the bus to come to the ground at the usual time and then got told to get off the bus because we found out about a couple of positives [cases],” England pacer James Anderson told reporters after stumps on day two.  
England’s players were then tested and waited about 45 minutes before the scheduled 10.30 a.m. start before heading to the ground.  
“We’re all having PCR tests now,” said Anderson, who took 4-33 in Australia’s first innings. “We’ll have to wait and see what the results are. As long as the group that is here at the ground today are negative, I don’t see why we can’t carry on.  
“As far as I’m aware, the whole playing group feels fine. We’ve just stepped up safety protocols around the dressing room, wearing masks and keeping distance where possible.”   
Australia’s opening batter Marcus Harris said he was confident the show would go on.  
“There are going to be hiccups. It’s the world we live in,” Harris said. “We can get games played. Issues arise but there are things in place and everyone is trying their hardest to make sure the games are played. I think we will find a way to get it done.”  
Australian broadcaster the Seven Network also said there had been a positive case among its staff working at the MCG, forcing last-minute changes to their commentary team.  
Driven by the Omicron variant, coronavirus cases are surging in Australia — particularly in Sydney — where the fourth Test is scheduled to start on January 5, before the Ashes finale in Hobart.  
More than 6,000 cases are being reported daily across New South Wales state, where Sydney is located.  
Nevertheless, Cricket Australia chief Nick Hockley said the plan was to press on as scheduled with the Ashes.  
“That’s absolutely the plan, there’s nothing to suggest otherwise. We’ll rely on the protocols,” he told reporters, before cautioning: “It’s a day-by-day proposition.”  
England faced a similar scenario earlier this year when the fifth Test of their home series against India was cancelled after multiple cases among the visitors’ support staff.  
Australia captain Pat Cummins, who missed the second Ashes Test because he was in Covid isolation, said the dramatic events on Monday were “a sign of the times”.  
“You’ve got to be pretty flexible,” he told sports broadcaster SEN.  
While the odds are stacked against England, having the match called off would be a bitter pill to swallow.  
Even with two Tests to play holders Australia would, by default, retain the urn if Melbourne is unable to proceed or be rescheduled.  
That could also place the rest of the series under a cloud.  
England’s players were already reluctant to tour Australia under strict Covid protocols and that reticence may only grow with the Ashes lost and nothing left to play for.  
They finished day two on life support after their batsmen again crumbled under pressure a day after being skittled for 185.  
Mitchell Starc (2-11) had opener Zak Crawley caught behind for five and number three Dawid Malan lbw for a duck in successive balls.  
The hat-trick ball whistled past the outside edge of England skipper Joe Root’s bat, drawing a gasp from the terraces.  
Debutant Scott Boland then triggered pandemonium in the stands when he had the hapless Haseeb Hameed caught behind for seven and nightwatchman Jack Leach bowled for a duck in the same over.  
With Ben Stokes and Root at the crease, England had lost four wickets after just 12 overs and still required another 51 runs to make Australia bat again.  
It was a bitter pill to swallow for Anderson and the other England bowlers, who had battled hard to drag their team back into the contest after Australia resumed on 66 for one in the morning.  
Even at 39 Anderson showed he has lost little of his brilliance, after dismissing Steve Smith (16), Harris (76) and Cummins (21) on day two after removing opener David Warner on day one.  
“I thought firstly on the bowling front we did really well to stick at our task throughout the day,” Anderson said. “We know that that last 12 overs was going to be tough with that new ball but even so, to lose four wickets was really disappointing.”

In the semi-finals on Thursday, Pakistan will face Sri Lanka while India, who earned a four-wicket win over Afghanistan in the other Group ‘A’ match on Monday, take on Group ‘B’ winners Bangladesh.
Qasim’s 50 off 67 balls, which featured eight boundaries, helped Pakistan to 219-8 in their 50 overs. Other key scorers were Haseebullah Khan (39), Ahmed Khan (34), A Shahzad (29) and Abdul Ghani (28).
Aayan Afzal grabbed 3-44 for the UAE, while Nilansh Keswani finished with 2-32.
Qasim then picked 3-52 as Pakistan restricted the UAE to 198-9. Mohammad Zeeshan (2-34), Mehran Mumtaz (2-35) and Maaz Sadaqat (2-21) also delivered with the leather with Kai Smith (38), Aayan Afzal (38) and Alishan (35) showing some resistance.

4,Rain wipes out day two of Centurion Test,Monday’s wash-out effectively means 66 overs have been lost.,"CENTURION: India’s bid to post a daunting first innings total in the first Test against South Africa suffered a blow when rain prevented any play on the second day at SuperSport Park on Monday. 
The tourists, seeking their first series win in South Africa, were in a strong position at 272 for three at the end of the first day on Sunday but were unable to build on the platform set by K.L. Rahul (122 not out) and the other Indian batsmen. 
It was raining at the scheduled start of play on Monday but although there were some brighter intervals, further rain together with a wet outfield caused the umpires to call off play for the day in the early afternoon. 
An extra half hour or eight overs of play will be added on the remaining three days, making for a possible 98 overs a day, but Monday’s wash-out effectively means 66 overs have been lost. 
Better weather is forecast for Tuesday and Wednesday, but India will have to quicken the pace of their innings if they are to drive home their advantage. 
They will want to post a big first-innings score and potentially bat only once in the test if they are not to run out of time in their quest for victory. 
South Africa will feel in the match too if they can wrap up the Indian innings quickly on the third day, but will have to bowl a lot better than on Sunday, when only seamer Lungi Ngidi (3-45) was among the wickets. 
The omission of fast bowler Duanne Olivier was a major talking point on Sunday. 
However, South African selection convener Victor Mpitsang explained on Monday Olivier’s preparation had been hampered by a Covid-19 infection and a slight hamstring injury. 
Olivier was the form bowler of the South African domestic season leading up to the Test series, with 28 wickets at an average of 11.10 in four first-class matches. 
With his ability to intimidate batsmen with fast, short-pitched deliveries, Olivier had been expected to play a key role in the Test team, especially after Anrich Nortje, the country’s fastest bowler, was ruled out of the series with a hip injury. 
Olivier took 48 wickets in ten Tests before joining English county Yorkshire on a Kolpak contract in 2019. 
With the Kolpak system coming to an end, he once again became available for South Africa. 
There was no explanation for Olivier’s absence when the team was announced, nor did the bowler indicate any possible barrier to him playing when Cricket South Africa released a recording of comments made by him last Thursday. 
But Mpitsang confirmed a report in The Citizen newspaper and was quoted on the ESPNCricinfo website on Monday as saying illness and injury had meant Olivier was not able to prepare fully for the first Test. 
“Duanne Olivier is healthy and well but did return a positive Covid-19 test result a number of weeks ago, which forced him to quarantine and took time away from his training,” Mpitsang told the website. 
“His workloads were not where the selection panel would have wanted them to be by the time he entered the team bubble ahead of the first Test match. 
“He picked up a hamstring niggle during the two-day, inter-squad match at the start of the camp and the selectors did not want to risk him unnecessarily when there are two more Test matches to think about.”

5,Chelsea get back on track,LONDON: Chelsea got back on track with a 3-1 victory at Aston Villa to move level on points with second-placed...,"LONDON: Chelsea got back on track with a 3-1 victory at Aston Villa to move level on points with second-placed Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. 
After one win in their previous four league games, Chelsea came from behind against a Villa team without boss Steven Gerrard due to a positive Covid test. They are third on 41 points, six behind leaders Manchester City. 
Chelsea fell behind at Villa when a Matt Targett cross flew in off the head of defender Reece James in the 28th minute but Jorginho brought Thomas Tuchel’s side level from the spot just before the break. 
Romelu Lukaku, a halftime substitute, put Chelsea ahead in the 65th minute after he headed just his sixth goal for the club since his move from Inter Milan before he won a stoppage-time penalty that Jorginho converted. 
“The own goal made things super complicated. The reaction was very good. It was a deserved win but hard work,” Chelsea boss Tuchel said. 
Hampered by injuries and Covid absences, Chelsea had surrendered top spot during a spluttering run before Christmas. 
They were in trouble again after James’ own-goal but Jorginho equalised six minutes later, the Italian stroking home a penalty after Matt Cash tripped Callum Hudson-Odoi. 
Lukaku hadn’t scored in the Premier League since the home game against Villa. A trip to Villa ended the drought that’s coincided with injuries and a coronavirus recovery — the Belgian striker finding the net with a fine glancing header from a Hudson-Odoi cross. 
A foul by Ezri Konsa to cut out Lukaku’s run then led to another penalty and Jorginho again made no mistake from the spot. 
In the day’s late fixture, Brighton & Hove Albion celebrated a first league win in 12 attempts to go above Leicester City into ninth in the standings. 
Leandro Trossard and Neal Maupay were on target before halftime to clinch a 2-0 win over Brentford.

6,Pakistan leg of Queen’s Baton Relay for next year’s CWG begins,"For the next two days, the Baton will be displayed at various locations across Karachi.","KARACHI: Pakistan on Monday welcomed the Queen’s Baton Relay for next year’s Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. 
Having arrived from Seychelles, the Baton embarked on its three-day sojourn in Karachi for the Pakistan leg of its relay after it was handed over to Pakistan Olympic Association president retired Lt Gen Arif Hasan by Deputy British High Commissioner Martin Dawson during a ceremony at the British Deputy High Commission. 
For the next two days, the Baton will be displayed at various locations across the city starting with the Sindh Madrassahtul Islam University and the Mausoleum of the Quaid-i-Azam on Tuesday before travelling to the Karachi Grammar School and the Kakri Ground in Lyari on Wednesday. 
“The Baton has twice been to Lahore in the past but it’s the first time it has come to Karachi,” Arif, who also heads the Commonwealth Games Association Pakistan due to his role in the POA, told Dawn on Monday. 
He said that the locations for the Baton’s display had been chosen due to their “historic significance”. 
“Karachi is the city of the Quaid-i-Azam and so we’re taking it to the school of the Quaid [Sindh Madrassahtul Islam University] and his mausoleum,” he added. “The aim of such an activity is to project the country and we collectively decided that we needed to also portray the Quaid.” 
On Monday, several prominent sports personalities carried the Baton including squash legend Jahangir Khan, hockey greats Hasan Sardar and Rasheed-ul-Hasan, and karateka Kulsoom Hazara. 
The next destination for the Baton after Pakistan is the Maldives after which it will go to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India as it traverses South Asia. 
The Queen’s Baton Relay is similar to the Olympic Torch Relay with the Baton carrying the message of the Queen to commonwealth countries. The message is read at the opening ceremony of the Games.

The final is evenly-poised between the two sides with Northern at 184-3 in their first innings, replying to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s 374.
Clearer skies are expected on the next two days and there is a possibility of outright winners even if the match is drawn. The team which have the greater first-innings score will lift the trophy.

11,Black Jack leads after high winds hammer Sydney to Hobart fleet,SYDNEY: More than a quarter of the boats competing in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race had retired by Monday morning...,"SYDNEY: More than a quarter of the boats competing in the Sydney to Hobart yacht race had retired by Monday morning after high winds and rough seas hammered the fleet off the coast of New South Wales overnight.
Mainsails were damaged and forestays broken as southerly winds of up to 30 knots forced 24 of the 88 boats out of the 628 nautical-mile (1,170-km) race, which started in Sydney Harbour on Sunday. 
Despite the conditions, the three 30-metre supermaxis led the fleet down the coast towards Bass Strait in a tight race for line honours. 
Black Jack had overhauled early leaders LawConnect and SHK Scallywag. It held an 18-nautical-mile lead over SHK Scallywag.  
The slightly shorter 24-metre Stefan Racing was in third place and LawConnect, was in fourth. 
The first yachts are expected to arrive in the capital of the island state of Tasmania on Tuesday. 
Two of the overnight retirements were forced by injuries to crew, but race organisers said they were not serious. 
Safety protocols for the race were markedly improved after a major storm sank five boats, killing six sailors, in the 1998 edition. 
Last year’s race was canceled the week before it was due to start because of coronavirus-related quarantine issues, but the 2021 edition is proceeding with mass virus-testing protocols in place. Skippers have been told boats must immediately retire from the race if a crew member receives a message from health authorities saying they have tested positive for Covid-19.

Owned by Syed Atif Ashfaq Shah and trained by Mohammad Afzal, the fashionably-bred filly clocked a fast timing of one minute 11 seconds and still looked comfortable while galloping to victory.
Back home, Lahore’s leading jockey  Aftab Choudhry celebrated his Quaid-i-Azam Gold Cup triumph in Karachi on Saturday piloting home two winners, Nostalgia and El Dorado.
