1,Civil servants promotion on merit must for good governance: LHC,"The court sets aside the decision of selection board, says promotion  of superseded officers should be from date of supersession.","LAHORE: A Lahore High Court’s ruling that allows petitions of three superseded senior police officers says the consideration for promotion of a superseded officer must be from the date of supersession decision by the Central Selection Board (CSB) so he/she could know the reasons for supersession and may improve in one year if possible.
“Any other interpretation of this rule will render it redundant and purposeless,” Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh observes in his 15-page judgement on petitions of Dr Azeem Khan and two other police officers.
The petitioners working in BS-19 to BS-20 were considered by the CSB in its meeting from Jan 4 to 7 2021 for promotion, however, the board recommended “supersession” of the petitioners and did not promote them to BPS-20 or BPS-21.
The counsel for the petitioners argued that that the relevant rules applicable for promotion from BS-18 to BS-21 said if a civil servant once superseded for promotion, he/she shall be eligible for reconsideration only after he/she earns one more performance evaluation report (PER) of full one year.
He said instead of waiting for a full one year, another CSB meeting was held on Jan 4 to 7 of 2021, wherein the petitioners were again superseded. He argued the impugned decision was clear violation of rule 10(5) of the Civil Servants Promotion Rules 2019, which was mandatory in nature.
Defending the impugned decision of the CSB, a law officer argued that rule 10(5) of the rules was complied with as the board in its meeting held on Jan 27-29th of 2020 considered the PERs of 2018 whereas in meeting of Jan 4 to 7th of 2021 the PERs of 2019 were considered.
Rejecting this argument of the government, Justice Sheikh, in his verdict, observes, “I am afraid this argument does not have any legs to stand in view of explicit language and mandatory requirement of rule 10(5) of the Rules, under which the superseding civil servant can only be reconsidered for promotion after he earns one more PER of full one year.”
The judge remarks that the obvious purpose of rule 10(5) of the Rules is to give sufficient opportunity and time to the superseded officer to improve and bring to an end the reasons on the basis of which the deferment took place.
Therefore, the judge states, the consideration for promotion of superseded officer must be from the date of supersession decision by the CSB so that he/she could know the reasons for supersession and may improve in one year if possible for his/her promotion in the next meeting of the board.
Justice Sheikh says this court is mindful of the fact that the CSB comprises of high personage with a variety of experience, however, the promotion of civil servants in accordance with law for the advancement of their career is of paramount importance for good governance, otherwise, their commitment to the job, dedication to duty and even integrity may be affected.
Setting aside the impugned decisions of the CSB, the judge has directed the respondents to reconvene meetings of the board to reconsider the cases of the petitioners for promotion.
“The CSB shall, however, act strictly on the basis of record and in accordance with law including the relevant rules,” the verdict concludes.

The three-lane underpass will ease the daily movement of 132,000 plus vehicles.
The  chief minister said the facility would also benefit the patients of  Gulab Devi, Children, Social Security and General hospitals besides  accommodating hundreds of thousands citizens in their daily commuting.
Speaking  to media, he said the Gulberg to Jail Road (Siddique Trade Centre)  flyover had also been named after poet Munir Niazi. He said the Abdul  Sattar Edhi underpass had been completed two months ahead of the  deadline.
The chief minister announced an elevated expressway  project costing Rs50 billion to facilitate Lahorites. Similarly, he  said, Rs6.5bn would be spent on the construction of multi-level entry  and exit points at Shahdara Mor to resolve traffic congestion.
Meanwhile,  he said, more than Rs9.16bn were being spent to complete three major  projects in the provincial metropolis. He said an additional lane was  being built at the Lahore Bridge near the Children’s Hospital. He said  Rs4.9bn were being spent on Data Ganj Bakhsh flyover and Rs2.54bn on  Shahkam Chowk flyover.
Alongside, he said, the expansion of  Saggian Road would be completed with Rs3.4bn and the Gulberg’s main  boulevard to Walton Road, Defence Chowk, would be made a signal-free  corridor with Rs3bn. He said an underpass and a flyover at Karim Block  in Iqbal Town would be built with a cost of Rs2.9bn.
Mr Buzdar  pointed out that the Orange Line Metro Train project was also completed  by the incumbent government by arranging necessary funding.  
He  said the past government conceived projects without caring for the  welfare of the people and subsidies to the tune of billions had to be  given to run them. He said the public transport scheme should have been  finalised after a proper study.
The chief minister said the PTI  would perform well in the second phase of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa local body  elections as the first phase had been completed.
He said the local  elections would be held in Punjab directly and the bill had been  presented in the Punjab Assembly. He said public representatives would  be empowered and the government would perform well in Punjab.
Answering  a question about Nawaz Sharif, the chief minister said anybody could  come or go while the law would take its own course and everything would  be done in accordance with the law.  
“The allies are with the PTI government and there is no need to worry,” he added.  
Provincial  ministers Murad Raas, Aslam Iqbal, Asad Khokhar, Ejaz Alam,  parliamentarians, PTI leaders, SACM Hasaan Khawar, IG police,  commissioner and deputy commissioner were present on the occasion.

7,Suspension of Centre’s order:  S&GAD halts process for PMS officers’ promotion,LAHORE: The Service and General Administration Department (S&GAD) has stopped the process of promotion of the...,"LAHORE: The Service and General Administration Department (S&GAD) has stopped the process of promotion of the Punjab Provincial Management Service (PMS) officers, apparently after the Lahore High Court suspended the operation of a federal government notification aimed at increasing the Centre’s share in the provincial bureaucracy.
Sources among the PMS officers claim the Punjab government had conducted the Promotion Selection Board (PSB) for over 100 PMS officers, but was not issuing the board meeting’s minutes to complete the promotion process. It is learnt that some officers are on the verge of their retirement and awaiting their promotion with their fingers crossed.
When contacted, services Secretary Shehryar Sultan neither responded to a call, nor replied the text message by this reporter for his stance.
Sources, however, say the Pakistan Administrative Service (PAS) bureaucrats are of the view that Punjab government had surrendered 65 posts in the province as per old formula of the Inter-Provincial Coordination Committee (IPCC). They say the Punjab government  
had on December 4 held the PSB against the 65 posts surrendered by the PAS, as well as other vacant posts already falling in the share of the PMS.
However, it stopped the PSB process as the LHC suspended the operation of a March 2021 federal government notification on Dec 8, 2021.
Punjab Provincial Management Service Association (PMSA) president Naveed Shahzad Mirza told Dawn that the LHC had suspended the operation of a March 2021 federal government notification intended to increase the PAS share in Punjab from 115 to 446 seats. The PMS officers in other provinces had also challenged the similar action by the federal government in the courts of their respective provinces, he added.
“The Punjab PMS had requested the provincial government that the posts over and above 446 posts should be considered for promotion, though we did not accept the enhanced quota for the PAS officers in Punjab,” Mr Mirza said.
He stated that the government accepted the request and conducted the PSB, but was not finalising the meeting’s minutes, rendering the promotion process incomplete. Now, he said, the question before the government was that how many seats should be considered for the promotion – whether the promotion should be made against the recently calculated posts or on the basis of the old formula.
Mr Mirza stated that he asked the services secretary to finalise the PSB proceedings on the basis of calculation of seats prior to the LHC order, suspending the March 2021 notification, because the board was held on Dec 4 and the LHC suspended the order on Dec 8.
The PMSA president quoted the secretary as saying that the calculation of seats for promotion of the PMS Punjab officers had reverted to the impugned IPCC formula of 1993, meaning thereby that the purportedly 65 posts surrendered by the PAS could not be considered for the PMS officers’ promotion. To do so, the PMS officers should get the notification suspension order withdrawn.
“We are looking into various possibilities to tackle the issue,” Mr Mirza said, adding that it was being considered whether the officers being affected could become a party. He said the association was also considering to move the court with the plea that the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) did not stop the promotion process after a similar order, but the Punjab government halted the same. Otherwise, he said, the suspension of federal government notification by the LHC would continue hitting the PMS officers in Punjab.
The PMSA president said he had constituted a high-powered committee comprising senior, mid-career and junior officers to negotiate with association’s former head Tariq Mahmood and convince him that the court’s suspension order was causing more damage to the officers than good. He said Mr Mahmood was adamant that he would not change his “principled stance”.
When contacted, Mr Mahmood said stopping the PSB process was tantamount to “blackmail” adding that the LHC’s historical order had actually increased 331 seats for the PMS officers.
Answering a question, Mr Mahmood said it was a matter of grave concern that the Punjab government was now creating a rift within the PMSA. He suggested the government should itself go into appeal against the LHC order, instead of asking the officers to withdraw the petition.
He appealed to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led Punjab government to intervene and ensure that the PMS officers should not be blackmailed and their due right to promotion not denied.

8,Farmers dismayed at Sindh’s opposition to Thal canal project,LAHORE: Sindh’s opposition to phase-II of the Greater Thal Canal (GTC) project has created concerns particularly...,"LAHORE: Sindh’s opposition to phase-II of the Greater Thal Canal (GTC) project has created concerns particularly among the farming community of the Thal desert, which had been anxiously waiting for completion of the long-delayed water channel. 
Any further delay in the execution of the project, the farmers believe, would be akin to a conspiracy against the poor residents of the desert area who have been at the mercy of weather even to harvest a single crop (gram) for centuries. 
“It is very astonishing that a province being led by a pro-people party for the last many years has opted to go against the benefit of the common people though the project is very much within all constitutional and legal bounds,” says Dr Amjad Magsi, a farmer of the Bhakkar district. 
“Just imagine the contribution two million acres of now barren but fertile Thal land will make to the agriculture and national economy on the completion of the Thal canal. It will bring about prosperity for the rural community of the desert, which spans from Khushab up to Muzaffargarh (six districts).” 
Shaukat Ali, a progressive farmer from Layyah district, says the national economy is getting damaged by blocking of an approved and partially constructed project midway in violation of the 1991 water accord (Water Apportionment Accord), which allows provinces to develop their irrigation system as per their share in the river waters. 
Sindh opposed the canal project in a meeting of the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) held last Wednesday when Punjab put up the case there for changing funding resources for the project. 
The GTC project had been approved by the Council of Common Interest (CCI), Central Development Working Party (CDWP) and Ecnec in the year 2001 while the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) had given water availability certificate for it in 2002 and reiterated the same in 2021. 
The federal government had decided to fund the GTC in Punjab as well as Rainee and Chashma Right Bank Canal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Kachhi Canal in Balochistan from its own resources. 
Total cost of the GTC was Rs30bn and the first phase of the project was completed in 2005 at a cost of Rs10bn. The rest of the two phases were pending since then for want of funds. 
Punjab went to Ecnec to get permission for funding of the rest of the project from the provincial resources. To the astonishment of Punjab, Finance Adviser Shaukat Tarin, who was chairing the meeting, referred the issue back to the CDWP when Sindh representatives Nisar Khuhro and Jam Khan Shoro objected to the project. 
Rehmat Khan Wardag, president of Tehreek-e-Istaqlal, a staunch supporter of developing new water resources, wonders how Ecnec or the CDWP could block an irrigation project on any grounds other than financial for only Irsa has the authority to decide technicalities of a project. He regrets that earlier Kalabagh Dam had been politicised by Sindh and now the GTC, a canal being built with the provincial financial and water resources, is being objected to, notwithstanding the plight of the poor farmers of Thal, who are, so far, depending on rainfall to get just one crop in a year and sometimes that too is damaged due to drought. 
Punjab Irrigation Minister Mohsin Leghari says they are working on water resource management as work on Dadhocha Dam in Potohar region and Jalalpur Canal is going on while tenders have been floated for Suwara Dam in Sulaiman Range, Dera Ghazi Khan. He says studies for more dams to harvest rainwater are being conducted, disclosing that water supply to new command areas will be provided through pipes to eliminate water losses, both due to evaporation and theft. He did not comment on the GTC issue. 
Meanwhile, it is learnt that MNA from Khushab and Chairman of Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Malik Ehsanullah Tiwana, who, as a precautionary measure, has quarantined himself after his bone-marrow transplant, has decided to call on Prime Minister Imran Khan to raise the GTC issue, which is a matter of life and death for the Thal farmers.

11,Drop in cotton yield due to outdated production technologies,LAHORE: Provincial Agriculture Minister Syed Hussain Jehanian Gardezi told the Punjab Assembly on Monday that cotton...,"LAHORE: Provincial Agriculture Minister Syed Hussain Jehanian Gardezi told the Punjab Assembly on Monday that cotton production in the country dropped for not adopting new production technologies.
Summing up the discussion on agriculture, he said cotton yield had gradually been on the decline since 2015 because the country failed to adopt new production technology, unlike the other countries.
He said neighbouring India improved its white lint output manifold during this period by embracing biotechnology. Referring to the ongoing fertilizer shortage in the province, Mr Gardezi said growers in the cotton belt gave up the crop and instead began cultivating rice, potatoes and other crops which not only dropped the white lint output but also increased demand for urea compost.
He said Punjab’s quota of urea fertilizer is 70 percent because of the size of its cultivation area, but the factories did not meet this quota and the province has written to the federal government in this regard.
He said the province needed 20,000 tonnes of urea fertilizer in December but it could get only 12,000 tonnes of the commodity.
He urged the lawmakers to adopt a resolution demanding an increase in the urea quota for meeting enhanced requirements of the compost.
About the DAP (diammonium phosphate) fertilizer, the minister said that DAP prices had begun to go up since the last year and now these had set an all-time high record. He said the government was extending Rs1,000 per bag subsidy to make DAP comparatively affordable for the farmers.
Meanwhile, the house gave an extension to four ordinances – The Punjab Medical and Health Institutions (Amendment) Ordinance 2021; The Ravi Urban Development Authority (Amendment) Ordinance 2021; The Punjab Commission on Irregular Housing Schemes (Second Amendment) Ordinance 2021; and The Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2021.

Farmers can be seen outside fertilizer dealers’ warehouses. They said dealers would sell urea at the official rate of Rs1,770 per bag in the presence of government officials. They would sell a load of trailer in the presence of officials and would hide other loads to be sold in the black market at inflated rates. Despite rampant complaints from farmers about the shortage of the commodity, the district administration is silent. 
Farmers alleged some dealers had also started selling fake fertilizer to make the most of the crisis. According to sources, fake fertilizers are being sold at Adda Domala Ikhlaspur, Zafarwal, and Shakargarh. 
Farmers Mahmood Ahmed and Mohammad Maqsood said that in order to get urea bags, they have to wait in long queues at warehouses. Mahmood said that his requirement was 20 bags of urea but he was provided only three bags. Farmers Muhammad Ayub and Muhammad Mustafa said that influential landlords were being supplied urea bags at their farms. 
Agriculture Assistant Director Tanveer Ahmed, however, said that urea fertilizer released to the dealers was being monitored. He said that fertilizer dealers did not get a chance to shift urea bags from trailer to warehouse as it was being sold on the spot.  
He said the Agriculture Department had sent five samples of fertilizers from different areas of the district to laboratories for testing. He said that four samples failed the laboratory test. He said the department had raided warehouses and recovered more than 300 bags of fake fertilizer bags and got FIRs registered. 
Farmers and traders have demanded that Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chief Minister Usman Bazdar take action on the situation.
