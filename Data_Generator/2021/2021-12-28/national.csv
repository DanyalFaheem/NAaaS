0,Appointment of Lahore NAB DG challenged in IHC,Petitioner argues government has violated the Supreme Court’s directives by relaxing the rules in favour of the new DG.,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Babar Sattar of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) will take up a petition against the appointment of the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) director general for Lahore region on Tuesday (today).
Mohammad Iqbal, an advocate, filed the petition through Barrister Zaffarullah Khan against the appointment of Jamil Ahmed, a retired federal secretary, on a one-year contract and his subsequent posting as the chief of Lahore NAB.
The Lahore directorate of the bureau has initiated a number of inquiries and investigations against the leadership of opposition parties, including the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s president Shehbaz Sharif and vice president Maryam Nawaz.
Jamil Ahmed, a former federal secretary (BS-22), was inducted into the bureau in BS-21 about a month ago after relaxation of rules.
The petitioner contended that the government had violated the Supreme Court’s directives by relaxing the rules in favour of the officer. 
He pointed out that the National Account­ability Ordinance (NAO) 1999 was promulgated to establish the National Accountability Bureau, but the law and its application had been criticised by the superior judiciary, the guardian of fundamental rights.
The petition said the four-year term of retired Justice Javed Iqbal as NAB chairman had ended on Oct 11 this year, but “the President of Pakistan promulgated a much criticised and person-specific law, the National Accountability (Amendment) Ordinance, 2021, and under its amended Section 6 (b)(ii) of NAO 1999, on expiry of the period of four years and till the assumption of charge by new chairman”.
Referring to Section 28 of NAO 1999, the petition stated that it empowers the NAB chairman to make appointments “for efficient performance of the functions of the Bureau”. 
According to the petition, the position of DG in any NAB region empowers him to supervise all the investigation and the rules prescribe the method of making such appointment.
During the hearing of a suo motu case in 2017, the apex court had directed the Federal Public Service Commission to initiate a process for filling vacancies in the National Accountability Bureau.
The petition alleged that the NAB chairman had appointed Jamil Ahmed as Director General (BS-21) “in connivance with secretary to the prime minister”. 
Referring to the summary for the prime minister, which has been circulating on social media, the petitioner contended that it “tells a sordid story as to how the impugned appointment is made in relaxation of relevant rules…how a handpicked person is appointed on such an important post without any fair and transparent manner.”
“He took charge on the same day in Lahore as if he might already have been there waiting to take charge. Appointment of a contract employee in the most sensitive and active region of NAB in such haste smacks mala fides,” the petition went on to state.
According to the petition, the appointment is against the principle of hierarchy and discipline as a retired BS-22 officer has been posted to a BS-21 position. 
“A junior officer is sometimes appointed against a post carrying a higher pay scale, but it is unheard of that an individual is working on a position which carries a grade lower than his own grade. This fact speaks for itself as to why such illegal appointment has been made,” the petition said.

1,Record shows lawmakers come to National Assembly only to mark attendance,Lack of quorum mars house proceedings for third consecutive day.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Monday adjourned without taking up any agenda item due to lack of quorum for the third consecutive day as the record of the assembly secretariat shows that lawmakers have made it a habit of leaving the Parliament House after marking their attendance. 
Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) lawmaker from Rahimyar Khan Sheikh Fayyazuddin pointed out the lack of quorum as soon as Speaker Asad Qaiser declared start of the question hour. 
Mentioning the empty treasury benches, the PML-N MNA said that he was feeling ashamed while pointing out the lack of quorum for which the presence of 86 members (one-fourth) of the 342-member house is necessary. 

Lack of quorum mars house proceedings for third consecutive day 

The speaker told Mr Fayyazuddin that it was not appropriate to point out quorum, stating that he had come from a far-flung area only to attend the session.  
The PML-N lawmaker responded that it was true that they came from far-off areas, but then while pointing towards empty treasury benches, he asked the speaker to tell the government people also to attend the session. 
The speaker first suspended the proceedings till completion of quorum, but he had to later adjourn the sitting till Wednesday afternoon (tomorrow) after the government failed to ensure the presence of the required number of the members. 
Earlier, the house was adjourned on a similar fashion on Dec 22 and Dec 24 because of the lack of quorum. However, interestingly, the assembly record shows that on Dec 22, a total of 219 members had marked their attendance whereas 176 lawmakers had marked their attendance on Dec 24. 
Further analysis shows that as many as 89 members belonging to the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and its allies were present on the opening day of the current NA session on Dec 22 whereas 105 treasury members marked their attendance on Dec 24 and the numbers on both the days were sufficient to complete the quorum.  
The opposition members have made it a practice to stage a walkout from the house after pointing out quorum. A majority of the members of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), however, were not present in the assembly on Monday as they were busy in the ceremonies arranged by the party to mark the 14th death anniversary of former prime miniser Benazir Bhutto. 
Meanwhile, in a written reply to a question asked by PML-N’s Sheikh Rohale Asghar, Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Zaidi informed the National Assembly that construction of the Gwadar Eastbay Expressway would be completed by April 11, 2022, with a total cost of Rs17.37 billion.  
The construction work on the 19.4-kilometre expressway began on October 12, 2017. The minister said that China Communications and Construction Company was the contractor of the project. 
In response to another question asked by Nuzhat Pathan of the PTI, Railways Minister Azam Swati told the assembly that a total of 442 train accidents had occurred since the PTI came to power in August 2018 to November 30.

2,Senate defers bill seeking to decriminalise suicide bid,Chairman seeks input of Council of Islamic Ideology.,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate on Monday deferred consideration of a bill seeking to decriminalise suicide attempt after members exchanged arguments for and against the idea.  
The criminal laws amendment bill proposing to amend the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to abolish punishment for those making attempts to commit suicide had been moved by Senator Shahadat Awan of the PPP, on the plea that this was done by people suffering from mental disorder who deserved medical treatment, not punishment.  
Mr Awan said such people were generally denied immediate treatment and referred for medico-legal process, placing their lives at risk. Therefore, he said, attempt to commit suicide, which currently carried one-year jail term, should be decriminalised.  

Chairman seeks input of Council of Islamic Ideology   

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Mohammad Khan said that opinion of religious scholars should be sought before passage of the bill. He said that it should be thoroughly discussed so that an otherwise good bill was not opposed in a state of confusion.  
Abdul Ghafoor Haidri of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) noted that attributing suicide to mental disorder was inappropriate as today the people facing abject poverty and joblessness were committing suicides under compelling circumstances. However, he said, suicide was prohibited in Islam. 
The mover told the house that the Senate standing committee had approved the bill and ulema and psychological experts had also supported the bill.  
He recalled that the house had passed a similar bill back on February 19, 2018, which had subsequently lapsed.  
Leader of the House in Senate Dr Shahzad Wasim also said that the act of attempted suicide must not be co-related with mental disorder.  
PML-N parliamentary leader in the Senate Azam Nazir Tarar said that 11 out of 13 members of the Senate committee had cleared the bill. He said the amendment should be passed to save lives lost due to procedural hitches in the way of treatment under the present law.  
Senator Mohsin Aziz of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), who heads the Senate standing committee on interior, said depression could also be a reason behind suicide attempt, and noted that a jail term could cast a negative impact on behaviour of an individual suffering from depression.  
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani said that he had no objection to the passage of the bill if a document proving that it had been approved by the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) was available.  
Senator Rjaz Chaudhry of the PTI was of the opinion that addressing the issue of medico-legal process and not abolishing the sentence was the solution.  
JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza wondered how attempted suicide could be permissible when suicide was forbidden. He stressed that the inappropriate amendment be withdrawn.  
Senator Faisal Javed of the PTI suggested that the bill be referred to the CII.   
The consideration of the bill was deferred by Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani with the directive of taking the CII’s input.  
The house passed the Islamabad Rent Restriction Amendment Bill, Trade Organisation Amendment Bill and Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Bill moved by Mohsin Aziz, Fauzia Arshad and Shahadat Awan, respectively.  
Senator Talha Mehmood of the JUI-F introduced in the house a bill seeking to amend the Banking Companies Ordinance to do away with the restrictions placed on politicians for being politically exposed persons. “Why we are treated like criminals,” he asked and said that politicians found it hard to obtain a credit card or open a bank account due to the provision.  
Rana Maqbool Ahmed of the PML-N introduced the Narcotic Substances Amendment Bill seeking to enhance punishment for wrongfully implicating a person in a drug case. He said that there should be a severe deterrent against the act as a wrongfully implicated person faced the threat of being awarded death sentence.

3,Pakistan lambastes open calls for genocide of Indian Muslims,Chargé d’affaires summoned to convey Islamabad’s serious concerns to New Delhi,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has expressed serious concern over the widely reported open calls by Hindutva proponents for carrying out genocide of Indian Muslims.  
“Today, the Indian chargé d’affaires was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Islamabad, and asked to convey the government of Pakistan’s serious concerns to the government of India over the widely reported open calls by Hindutva proponents for carrying out genocide of Indian Muslims,” said a statement issued by the Foreign Office on Monday.  
According to the FO, these violent hate speeches were made during the “Dharma Sansad” held at Haridwar, Uttarakhand, on December 17-20.  

Chargé d’affaires summoned to convey Islamabad’s serious concerns to New Delhi 

“It was impressed upon the government of India that it was highly reprehensible that the Hindu Raksha Sena’s Prabodhanand Giri and other Hindutva figures who called for ethnic cleansing have neither expressed any regret nor the Indian government has condemned or taken any action against them so far,” the FO deplored.  
The statement said it was conveyed to the Indian side that the reported hate speeches had been viewed with grave concern by civil society and cross-section of the people of Pakistan and around the world. Regrettably, the toxic narrative against minorities, particularly Muslims, and their persecution understate patronage had become a norm under the current Hindutva-driven BJP-RSS combine government in India, it added.  
It was reminded to the Indian side that such incitement to violence by Hindutva figures, including ruling party’s elected members, also preceded the anti-Muslim riots in New Delhi in February 2020.  
The FO said the continued grave violations of human rights of minorities, especially Muslims, and their places of worship, anti-Muslim legislation by the Union Government of India and several BJP-ruled states, and continued incidents of violence against Muslims on flimsy pretexts by Hindutva groups with complete impunity and often under state patronage highlighted the worsening trend of Islamophobia and present a grim picture about the fate of Muslims in India.  
“Pakistan calls on the international community, including the United Nations, OIC and relevant human rights organisations, to hold India accountable for its gross and systematic human rights violations against minorities, particularly Muslims, and take immediate measures to save them from impending genocide,” the FO statement said, adding that India is expected to investigate these hate speeches and incidents of widespread violence against minorities, particularly Muslims, and their houses of worship and take measures to stop such incidents from recurring in future.

5,"Rangers help to be sought to retrieve land in Sindh, says FIA",Books 117 in ‘mega’ drive against land grabbers,"LAHORE: Calling it the first “mega operation” against illegal occupants of federal government’s properties, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) claims to have retrieved land worth over Rs15 billion in different parts of the country over a week. 
Last week, the FIA had launched the operation across the country on the directives of the Supreme Court and registered 39 first information reports (FIRs) against 117 suspects — incumbent and former officials of the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), revenue department as well as private people — for their alleged involvement in illegal occupation of ETPB properties, non-payment of rent for years and violation of lease contracts, thus causing a loss to the exchequer. 

Books 117 in ‘mega’ drive against land grabbers

The action is being carried out under the supervision of Dr Shoaib Suddle (the head of the one-man commission on minorities’ rights) and FIA Director General Sanaullah Abbasi. 
“The retrieval of the federal government land from illegal occupants will continue and wrongdoers will be dealt with strictly. In Sindh, the FIA will seek the help of Rangers to free the occupied land from grabbers,” FIA Punjab Director Mohammad Rizwan told a press conference here on Monday. 
Of the Rs15bn worth ETPB properties recovered, Rs6bn worth of land was retrieved in Lahore, Rs4bn from other parts of Punjab and the remaining from other provinces. A sum of Rs296 million has been recovered in arrears. 
“In the second round of the operation (this week onwards), it is expected that the federal government’s properties worth over Rs100bn will be retrieved from grabbers. No such action has been taken in the past,” Mr Rizwan claimed, alleging that two former ETPB heads were also involved in land grabbing. 
“Multiple FIRs have been registered against Asif Akhtar Hashmi and Siddiqul Farooq on charges of embezzlement and criminal breach of trust and investigation against them is under way,” he said. 
Mr Farooq and Mr Hashmi are associated with the PML-N and the PPP, respectively. 
“On the Supreme Court’s directives in respect of forensic audit of the ETPB conducted by the Accountant General of Pakistan, the ETPB officials are found involved in commission of irregularities in the matter of properties lying in trust with the board, thereby causing a loss of Rs77.6bn to the national exchequer,” the FIA director said, adding that the agency also recovered arrears from the defaulting tenants after registration of cases and inquiries against delinquent officials of the ETPB, revenue departments and private persons involved in causing a loss to the exchequer. 
“Of the 776 audit paras, 453 have been addressed till now,” he said and especially lauded the performance of two officers of the Lahore wing, Beenish Rehman and Shahid Ali, in the ongoing drive. 
Giving details of the recoveries by each FIA station, Mr Rizwan said: “FIA Punjab zone-I has retrieved 230 acres of land worth Rs5,831m and recovered Rs19.6m in arrears. Punjab zone-II has retrieved 302 acres worth Rs3,981.9m, Islamabad zone 274 acres worth Rs1261.4m and Rs7.3m in arrears. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa zone recovered eight acres worth Rs2,170.4m and Rs4.4m in arrears, Sindh zone-I retrieved two kanals worth Rs400m and Rs250.8m in arrears, Sindh zone-II retrieved 331 acres worth Rs104m and recovered Rs9.6m in arrears, while the Balochistan zone retrieved six kanals worth Rs1,280m and recovered Rs8m in arrears.”

In a joint resolution adopted in the last session, assembly members demanded that the province’s elected legislators should be taken into confidence about the project before taking a decision or signing an agreement about its future.
Balochistan Governor Syed Zahoor Ahmed Agha then summoned a special session of the assembly for an in-camera briefing.
Some 42 out of 65 members from both sides of the aisle attended the 10-hour session, briefed by the additional attorney general of Pakistan and officials from the federal authorities concerned.

Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Quddus Bizenjo and his cabinet members also attended.
The session — presided over by Deputy Speaker Babar Khan Musakhail in the absence of Speaker Mir Jan Mohammad Khan Jamali — started two hours later than the scheduled time.
A provincial government spokesman said a question-answer session was also held after the briefing in which officials and the additional attorney general replied to several questions asked by the assembly members.
“Provincial lawmakers were also app­rised of the verdicts given by international institutions about Reko Diq and the progress on their implementation,” the spokesman said.
Describing the arrangement of briefing as “a courageous step”, the spokesman claimed that for the first time in Balochistan’s history such an in-camera session was arranged by the government to brief legislators on an important project,
“The [provincial] government does not believe in taking decisions in closed rooms. All decisions, including those on Reko Diq and other issues, would be taken after close consultation with the opposition and all stakeholders concerned,” he said.
Rejecting criticism from different corners on holding an in-camera briefing, he said the provincial government was fully determined to protect the rights and resources of Balochistan.
The media was not allowed to cover the proceedings of the in-camera session, whereas all the ministers, advisers and parliamentary secretaries were also directed to keep their mobile phones with the assembly staff to participate in the session.
