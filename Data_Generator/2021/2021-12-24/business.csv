Pakistan’s imports from Afghanistan went up by 99pc to $18.960 million in July-August 2021 from$9.514m over the same months of last year.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has extended the facility of cash convertible currencies as export proceeds for settlement of export to Afghanistan and Central Asian States, which had expired on October 15, 2021. The facility is now extended until December 31, 2021.
Under the facility, authorised dealers will accept cash convertible currencies brought over their counters as export proceeds without asking for customs declaration for passengers. On July 2, 2021, the SBP issued a circular revising the procedures and made it mandatory for exporters to show evidence of the dollars at the time of issuing Form E.
The change was resisted by the stakeholders, including exporters and the SBP, put the requirements were put in abeyance until October 15, 2021, which was further extended to December 31, 2021.
To facilitate the exporters of perishable products, the government has allowed exports of fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, meat and fish in the Pak rupee to Afghanistan. The government has now added rice and pharmaceutical products to the list of exports to Afghanistan.
The SBP is also likely to include more items in the list for trading in the Pak rupee with Afghanistan.
Two other proposals are also under consideration to allow trade with Afghanistan through land routes in local currency or currency swap agreements.

1,Task force activated to allow more LNG imports via Gwadar port,The virtual LNG pipeline project envisages a floating LNG vessel to be berthed permanently at Berth 3 of the port.,"ISLAMABAD: The Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) on Thursday issued directions for activation of a task force as required under LNG Policy 2011 and asked the ministries of Maritime Affairs and Energy to come up with their considered views with clarity on how to allow additional future Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports through Gwadar Port.
The meeting of the CCoE presided over by Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar took up a report by a committee led by Deputy Chairman Planning Commission Dr Jehanzeb Khan on the establishment of LNG import terminals and virtual LNG pipeline (vehicle-based) at Gwadar.
The virtual LNG pipeline project envisages a floating LNG vessel to be berthed permanently at Berth 3 of the port. LNG will be replenished in the FSU using LNG carriers from Qatar, Abu Dhabi, or Oman being close to Gwadar and discharged into road tankers for onward regasification through vaporizers.
The committee had consulted all the stakeholders under instructions from the prime minister and suggested that strict guidelines be given to the regulator (Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority), port authorities and potential LNG developers to complete the due processes at their specific ends to ensure availability of additional LNG by next winter.
The CCoE was informed of significant investor interest in the sector and the need for LNG import in the country. The Dr Khan-led committee believed there was no need for competitive bidding for the LNG terminal and virtual pipeline under the LNG Policy, nor any requirement for Gwadar Port Authority (GPA) to conduct its own study on the use of the third berth at Gwadar Port or a separate dedicated terminal at a far distance for safety and security reasons.
The report said the safety and viability of using Berth 3 for LNG handling could be ascertained when the potential developer conducts the requisite studies and the Ogra and port authorities will review the findings.
The committee reported that LNG Policy 2011 required an LNG task force comprising all stakeholders to act as a “one-stop-shop” for all LNG-related issues like import projects, interpretation of policies and regulations but had been missing since then. Hence, the task force should be immediately activated.
The report recommended that potential investors be allowed to conduct all the required studies at the port and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Ogra and port authorities should process all the pending applications in this regard.
Boosting LPG production
The CCoE also considered the report on the issue of enhancement of domestic LPG production.
Mr Umar also directed the Petroleum Division to submit a summary to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet for the resumption of the operations of Jamshoro Joint Venture Ltd (JJVL) for LPG production.
The Deputy Chairman Planning Commission (DCPC) presented the recommendations on the way forward for maximising affordable gas supply to the residential consumers. The committee underscored the need for addressing both the short- and long-term gas sector issues.
The DCPC recommended that SSGCL should give 8-10mmcfd of its gas at a gas field in Sindh for production of LPG to meet additional requirements amid serious energy shortages while JJVL should clear about Rs420 million of undisputed pending dues immediately, while the remaining Rs6bn disputed amount pending adjudication in the Supreme Court should be pursued by both parties for settlement and JJVL would implement whatever be the court decision.
However, it was noted that the ECC had earlier taken certain decisions on the issue, hence the Ministry of Energy should get back to the ECC for the resumption of the operations of JJVL for LPG production suspended almost a year ago due to NAB investigation and court cases.

2,PSX barely moved up in rupee terms in 2021,"Technology and textile spinning remain top-performing sectors with returns of 37pc and 35pc, respectively.","KARACHI: The benchmark index of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) barely inched up in rupee terms during the outgoing calendar year, according to a research note released by Topline Securities on Thursday.
With only seven trading sessions remaining in 2021, the KSE-100 index has gained just one per cent in rupee terms while the dollar-based return is -9pc, it said.
Based on market capitalisation, technology and textile spinning remained the top-performing sectors with returns of 37pc and 35pc, respectively.
Tobacco and refinery sectors were the worst-performing segments with declines of 35pc and 29pc, respectively.
“Pakistan’s rising IT exports, the government’s focus on facilitating the IT sector and the devaluation have led to higher sales and profitability for the tech sector. The textile spinning sector posted strong gains in 2021 amid rising exports, record cotton prices and huge inventory gains,” said Umair Naseer, associate director of research at the brokerage house.
The top-performing share in 2021 was TeleCard Ltd as its value increased more than five times. “Investors were excited about rising profits and prospects of the company on the likely IPO [initial public offer] of its wholly owned subsidiary Supernet. Furthermore, the award of long-term business contracts to Supernet and the opportunities that may arise from the technology sector boom are also seen as positives for the stock,” said Mr Naseer.
TeleCard Ltd was followed by TPL Properties Ltd and Systems Ltd, which registered annual gains of 290pc and 100pc, respectively. TPL Properties Ltd completed the sale of its first property project Centrepoint in the first half of 2021 for roughly Rs8 billion. Systems Ltd, which is the country’s largest listed IT firm, remained among the top-performing stocks for the second consecutive year.

3,Shahid Khaqan wants airports declared duty-free zones,"Says world is changing and “we have to simplify things in order to compete with the world, and not to make things more difficult”.","RAWALPINDI: Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi on Thursday proposed to declare the country’s airports as duty-free zones, similar to those in Dubai, so that operators could import aircraft components and keep them in the airport area.
Attending a meeting of the Senate’s subcommittee on aviation as a special invitee, Mr Abbasi said the world was changing and “we have to simplify things in order to compete with the world, and not to make things more difficult”.
The meeting, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, reviewed and discussed amendments to the Civil Aviation Rules 1994 and National Aviation Policy 2019.
The committee was informed by the RPT operators that the airlines had to face a delay of two to three years in getting fresh licences for domestic and international flights.
The CAA explained to the committee that fresh licences for domestic and international flights were approved by the federal cabinet and the delay was due to clearance from security agencies.
Senator Afnan Ullah Khan said these security clearance protocols were the real hindrance to the economy.
The Regular Public Transport (RPT) operators suggested that the power to issue fresh licences for domestic flights should be given to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) director general and those for international flights to the Ministry of Aviation.
The committee lamented the rules regarding renewal of licence. “Why do we need a renewal of licence?” Mr Mandviwalla asked, terming the idea absurd. He wondered why students needed a licence approved by the CAA whose only work was to monitor private flying schools, and not students.
Mr Abbasi wondered when the licence of an operator expired in two years how could he acquire an aircraft on lease for seven years.
Senator Aon Abbas suggested that a timeline should be also fixed for the issuance of licences which might not be exceeded from 45 to 60 days and the ministries concerned should finish their queries by that time.
The RPT operators also conveyed their concerns to the committee about the cumbersome procedure they have to go through for importing spare parts of aircraft.
Mr Mandviwalla said this issue was of prime importance and rules should be drawn to provide facilities to the RPT operators and not problems.
On the issue of private plane licence, the committee asked the CAA officials why a person needed a renewal of licence after five years. Mr Mandviwalla said the validity of the licence for private planes should be subject only to medical fitness and recency of flights.
The committee lamented the intrusion by the FAA Inspector in the simulation of pilots. Mr Mandviwalla wondered when the simulation of pilots was a facility recognised by the CAA then why do “we need an inspection from the FAA Inspector?”
The committee prohibited the fasting by pilots and directed the CAA officials to take this into consideration while amending the rules.
CAA Director General Khaqan Murtaza sought two months to prepare the draft inculcating therein all the amendments proposed by the RPT operators for further deliberations by the committee.

4,Sindh governor assures CNG dealers of crisis resolution,"CNG dealers express reservations over the lingering gas crisis, hand over a smart load management plan to the Sindh governor.","KARACHI: Sindh Governor Imran Ismail on Thursday assured a delegation of compressed natural gas (CNG) dealers for taking up the issue of pump closures and their proposals relating to smart load management during his meeting with Prime Minister Imran Khan in Islamabad on Friday.
During a meeting with a four-member delegation of the CNG Association at the Governor House, the governor said all the problems and issues of CNG stakeholders would be resolved on a priority basis.
The CNG dealers had expressed reservations over the lingering gas crisis and handed over a smart load management plan to the Sindh governor.
Meanwhile, Sindh Energy Minister Imtiaz Ahmed Sheikh along with a delegation of Pakistan CNG Dealers Association led by Abdul Sami Khan held a press conference at his office over closure of gas stations.
The provincial energy minister, while lambasting the performance of government’s ministers Hammad Azhar and Aftab Siddiqui, said the federal government was not providing Sindh its due share of gas.
He said the Sindh government has been raising voice at all legal forums but the federal government is not ready to solve the gas crisis despite the fact that the CNG sector needs only 13 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of gas.
Mr Sheikh said Sindh and Balochistan, which are the main gas producers, have been deprived of gas while it was being supplied to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The Constitution gives the first right usage of gas where the gas is produced, but Sindh is engulfed in deep gas shortage, while domestic consumers are also facing problems either non availability of gas or very low pressure, he maintained.
He claimed that no country was ready to give gas to Pakistan while vessels carrying furnace oil more than the requirement were at the outer anchorage of the port seeking storage of fuel oil.
“We need to know who is formulating the ill-conceived policies,” he said urging the government to leave the country and its economy as the government has been continuously failing in fulfilling its promises.
He said he had asked the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) to provide data regarding gas production in Sindh, production of gas at various wells in Sindh and supply situation in the two provinces.
Mr Sheikh said the PTI and MQM are not taking up gas crisis issue with the federal government as both the parties were enjoying their powers. He added that the stakeholders in the CNG sector had invested millions of rupees in setting up stations but they were not getting the gas.
He assured the delegation that Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has been continuously taking up gas shortage issue in Sindh at every forum.
Abdul Sami Khan said workers of CNG stations are facing deep financial crisis due to closure of stations from December 1, 2021 while their families are in also deep stress.
He said the government had asked the CNG stakeholders to set up gas stations but now all stations were closed.
In a statement, President Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), Mian Nasser Hyatt Magoo said the CNG association in Sindh has gone on strike but the government was not even contacting or listening to their concerns. First, their livelihoods have been jeopardised and now they are being neglected and their voice is not being heard.
He said the failure of the government to provide gas to the industry has caused unbearable losses and the country is losing its momentum of productivity, export orders, employment generation, which will reflect in the country’s growth rate during the current FY22.
He asked the Prime Minster Imran Khan to reprimand the relevant ministries and departments responsible for the gas crisis. Mr Magoo was of the view that this was a conspiracy against the government.

7,Engro wants gas subsidy for fertiliser sector abolished,"LAHORE: Engro Fertilisers on Thursday called upon the government to devise and announce fertiliser policy 2022,...","LAHORE: Engro Fertilisers on Thursday called upon the government to devise and announce fertiliser policy 2022, withdraw gas subsidy, enable the industry’s move to Weighted Average Cost of Gas (WACOG) and help exports of urea and other fertilisers to various countries.
“Prior to 1980-81, Pakistan imported well over 50 per cent of its annual fertiliser requirements and had been a net importer till 2012. However, thanks to the Fertiliser Policy of 2001, which led to investment in new plants and increase in production capacity,” Engro Fertilisers’ Chief Financial Officer Imran Ahmed told a press conference. “Since we believe that increased reliance on imported gas is dangerous to the economy, we suggest the government for devising and announcing a revised Fertiliser Policy 2022 which should aim at eliminating the subsidy on gas for the fertiliser sector and enable the much-needed transition towards WACOG,” he said.
Responding to a question, he dispelled the impression that the shortage of urea and its sale on higher rates (Rs600 above or so) existed on the part of millers. The problem seems to be on the part of dealers and the officers (respective district administration), he said. “We are ready to show our entire sales record with invoices to anyone as the per bag wholesale price we received is Rs1,730 that is supposed to be sold in retail in Rs1,768 per bag. The same is reported as being sold for Rs2,300 or so in the country’s open market. We have also learnt that urea bags were smuggled to Afghanistan,” he explained.
Mr Ahmed questioned since the millers did not sell urea beyond demand of the dealers (as per area under cultivation), how it became short in the market. “It means the dealer stocked it and created artificial shortage that needs to be checked by the government’s enforcement departments concerned and not us.”
