• Says dynastic politics must be discouraged
• Inaugurates tech zone in Lahore 
LAHORE: Prime Minister Imran Khan has directed the Punjab government and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leadership to begin homework for the upcoming local government elections in the province, adding he would personally oversee the preparations.
During a meeting with government officials and the political leadership in Punjab at the Chief Minister secretariat on Thursday, PM Khan acknowledged that wrong selection of candidates had led to the party’s defeat in its stronghold of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“The government and party leadership should strictly select candidates on merit and avoid dynastic politics, which was exposed after causing damage to the party in KP,” sources quoted PM Khan as saying.
“The mistakes made in KP must not be repeated in Punjab,” he stressed. With candidates selected on merit, Mr Khan said, the PTI would give a tough time to its opponents in the local government elections in Punjab.
The sources quoted him as saying that his party organised the KP local bodies elections in a free and fair manner as it neither tried to hijack the polls nor alleged any foul play even after losing. Instead, the sources said, the prime minister had taken his party members to task for promoting dynastic politics and not selecting candidates on merit.
Still, the sources quoted Mr Khan as saying, the PTI was the second largest party in KP, while the PML-N and PPP had been wiped out of the province.
The prime minister asked the government and party leaders to take senior and old party leaders in the loop and hold consultations for contesting the Punjab LG elections with full vigour. The premier said he wanted to hold the elections at the earliest so that power and funds could be devolved at the grassroots and the masses’ problems resolved at their doorsteps. Mr Khan also directed that the Sehat Insaf Card distribution should be expedited.
The meeting was attended by Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, Governor Chaudhry Sarwar, federal ministers Shafqat Mahmood, PM’s special assistant Dr Shahbaz Gill, Punjab Local Government Minister Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed, Health Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid and party workers.
Earlier, PM Khan held a meeting with Punjab Irrigation Minister Mohsin Leghari and discussed a joint strategy for monitoring river water to address the reservations of Sindh.
Mr Leghari told the premier that a team had visited Punjab and was received well at Taunsa Barrage. However, he said, when the team was sent to visit the Guddu Barrage it was not entertained by the Sindh government, at which Mr Khan expressed disappointment.
The premier also took a briefing about the ongoing irrigation projects in the province.
Lahore Technopolis
Pakistan can break the vicious cycle of depleting foreign reserves and repeatedly going to the International Monetary Fund only by focusing on exports and attracting foreign investment through clean governance.
This was stated by PM Khan at the inaugural ceremony of Lahore Technopolis, a special technology zone, here on Thursday. The prime minister said Pakistan could leapfrog by concentrating on and incentivising IT parks like the Technopolis, adding that such initiatives would be established in all big cities of the country.
“Ensuring ease of doing business in technology parks will help attract foreign investment, expand exports and offer much-needed jobs to the youth of Pakistan,” he said and directed that the government offer tax breaks and remove regulation hurdles in such endeavours. “The IT industry alone can pay off the country’s current account deficit.”
Mr Khan announced he was going to launch orientation sessions for the government as well as the entire country to redirect focus on learning how a country’s exports could be enhanced and wealth increased. He said there were many things that need not be imported but developed indigenously like palm oil, adding that Pakistan had to bear the brunt of inflation in other countries only because it was importing various daily-use items.
Stressing on efforts to increase exports, the premier cited examples of China and India that he said developed their IT industries, incentivised their overseas citizens to return and develop businesses that eventually fetched foreign investment. He said China consciously increased exports, piled up national wealth and brought 700 million people out of the quagmire of poverty.

1,Shehbaz asks people to help PDM send govt packing,Ayaz Sadiq claims Nawaz Sharif is returning ‘very soon’.,"LAHORE: Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday declared that the end of the Imran Khan government is near, urging people to get ready to support a decisive move by the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to dislodge the government.
“The Imran Khan government’s days are numbered. Now, this drama of inaugurating the already launched projects of PML-N is not going to save him. Time has come to grab them (Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leaders) by the collar as this nation has not seen a worse time in the 74-year history of the country. This government’s end is near,” Shehbaz said while addressing an event in connection with the death anniversary of Khwaja Mohammad Rafique, the father of PML-N leaders Khwaja Saad and Salman Rafique, here on Thursday.
Charged PML-N workers chanted slogans of ‘Go Niazi Go’ during the speeches of their leaders. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif also spoke through video link from London where he has been residing since November 2019 for ‘medical treatment’.
Although the PML-N top leadership has not yet hinted at moving a no-confidence motion against the PTI governments at the Centre or Punjab, the party’s senior vice president Shahid Khaqan Abbasi recently said the PML-N would not consider the option till it was clear that the Constitution was supreme in the country and the system was running without “interference” as per democratic principles and norms.

Ayaz claims Nawaz is returning ‘very soon’

Shehbaz asked the people to get ready to help the opposition alliance, the PDM, to send the PTI government home for making their lives miserable through unbridled price hike and inflation.
The PDM has announced a ‘decisive’ anti-inflation march on Islamabad on March 23, 2022 to protest against the government’s failures.
The opposition leader, in a rare reference to the military establishment, said the PTI did get votes, but everyone knew it was “pushed” to come to power. “Imran Khan has made the lives of his supporters miserable too,” he lamented.
Taunting the premier, Shehbaz said if Imran Khan was so fond of installing plaques on projects launched by Nawaz Sharif he should have asked the PML-N that could have assigned him the job. “Today, Imran Khan inaugurated the Knowledge Park project here which we initiated in 2014,” he remarked.
Critical of the role of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in “deliberately” ignoring a number of scams like flour, sugar, medicines, BRT, Malamjabba, the opposition leader said this was the reason he openly called it a “NAB-Niazi alliance”. He also lambasted the PTI government for rendering hundreds and thousands of people jobless in the face of its promise to provide 10 million jobs. Besides, he said, this government had not built a single house so far against the promised five million ones.
In his address, former premier Nawaz Sharif claimed that in India Imran Khan was called a “puppet” and in the US it was said that the PM had powers even less than those of a mayor. “This man (Imran) used to say that he will rather commit suicide than go to the [International Monetary Fund]. Now, we are waiting for him to commit suicide,” the PML-N quaid said.
“In the name of a ‘New Pakistan’, inept and incompetent people were imposed on the nation who ruined the country economically. The PTI government destroyed the PIA and brought disrespect to the green passport,” he said and underlined the mega achievements of his tenure.
Speaking on the occasion, former National Assembly speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq claimed that Nawaz Sharif was returning to the country “very soon”. Mr Sadiq, who recently met Nawaz in London, said he was going to London again next month to see the party supremo. “Nawaz Sharif will return to Pakistan very soon. My smile says something is going to happen,” he exclaimed.
The former speaker questioned if the state could ensure the youth were given their right to franchise. “Soon, Imran Khan will be back atop a container. One day he will have to [become a democrat],” he said, adding that the man who was using the name of the state of Madina was lying to people. “Imran Khan has given nothing to [those in boots] and the people except inflation and unemployment,” he commented.
PML-N MNA Khwaja Asif said that in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa local government polls, the PTI did not get any “facilitation”, a reference to the establishment.

2,ECP reserves verdict on pleas for Vawda’s disqualification,ISLAMABAD: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday reserved its judgement on petitions seeking...,"ISLAMABAD: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday reserved its judgement on petitions seeking disqualification of PTI Senator Faisal Vawda over alleged concealment of his dual nationality.
A three-member bench of the commission, headed by Chief Election Commis­sioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, during the last hearing had given Mr Vawda the last chance to defend himself and explain his position.
The petitions against Mr Vawda said he was a dual national at the time of filing his nomination papers to contest 2018 general election. Mr Vawda submitted his nomination papers to the ECP on June 11, 2018 and had allegedly applied for renunciation of his US nationality days after that.
Qadir Khan Mandokhel, Mian Faisal and Mian Asif Mehmood subsequently filed petitions with the ECP seeking Mr Vawda’s disqualification.
During Thursday’s hearing, Barrister Moeed, counsel for Mr Vawda, submitted the senator’s birth certificate to the ECP. He said Mr Vawda was born in California and was a US citizen by birth. “Faisal Vawda got his foreign passport cancelled before submitting his nomination papers,” he said, adding that the senator had not lied.
A member of the bench however sought to know the date of the passport’s cancellation while the CEC wondered if the passport’s cancellation amounted to elimination of citizenship as well.
The lawyer said it was written in the returning officer’s (RO) order that the foreign passport was cancelled.
Mr Mandokhel said it was 23rd hearing in the ECP which had been seeking answers for the last one year and five months but had not received any.
“The RO gave a wrong order on dual citizenship in the 2018 [general] election. The RO rejected my [nomination] papers instead of rejecting Faisal Vawda’s,” Mr Mandokhel said.
Shah Mohammad Jatoi, a member of the bench, asked Mr Mandokhel if he had challenged the decision in any tribunal and told him to satisfy the bench on taking up the matter directly in the ECP.
The CEC remarked that Mr Mandokhel had said at the last hearing that arguments were complete but now he was mentioning new things.
Mr Vawda’s counsel argued that his client had obtained a normal identity card from the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) before 2018 elections. “Cancellation of his Nicop (National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis) and Nadra’s confirmation prove that he was not an American citizen,” he said.
The CEC questioned whether Nadra was authorised to verify whether anyone was a foreign citizen or not.
The lawyer responded that Nadra issued identity cards only after verification by the Intelligence Bureau.
Mr Vawda said that no dual citizenship holder had a normal identity card, adding that such an individual would not even be able to open a bank account.
“If Faisal Vawda is no longer an MNA, then how can he be disqualified on this petition?” his counsel argued. “Qadir Mandokhel deliberately approached the wrong forum to conduct a media trial,” Barrister Moeed said as he wrapped up his arguments.
Mr Vawda said that as a candidate for a National Assembly seat, he was not well informed about the law. “I am being dragged for no reason, the opponents did not go to any tribunal,” he said.
The ECP dismissed Mr Mehmood’s petition on grounds of non-compliance and reserved its verdict on the other petitions.

3,K-Electric seeks Rs5.50 per unit hike in tariff,ISLAMABAD: K-Electric has sought about Rs5.50 per unit increase in its tariff on account of monthly fuel cost...,"ISLAMABAD: K-Electric has sought about Rs5.50 per unit increase in its tariff on account of monthly fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for November and quarterly tariff adjustment (QTA) for July-September 2021 to raise about Rs16 billion from consumers over the next three months.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has decided to hold a public hearing on Jan 3 to examine whether the Karachi-based utility’s request for 32 paisa per unit additional FCA for November (Rs446 million) and Rs5.18 per unit (about Rs15.5bn) under the QTA was justified and if the company had followed economic merit order for power generation.
KE had originally demanded an increase of Rs4.94 per unit under the QTA but later raised it to Rs5.18 on the grounds that its original request was based on the latest FCA for the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) approved by Nepra for October available at the time of the request. However, this was subject to adjustments and had now been revised on the basis of CPPA’s November FCA now approved by Nepra.
The company also claimed about Rs762m additional QTA on account of Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC). The additional QTA involves overall operation and management and capacity costs worth about Rs6bn and about Rs9.4bn on account of fuel costs and power purchase price. These include O&M (operation & maintenance), PPP (power purchase price), capacity costs, uncovered cost of previous FCA due to non-adjustment of system losses, etc.
During the current billing month, KE consumers are already paying an additional FCA of Rs3.76 per unit on account of electricity they consumed in October. The upcoming FCA and QTA on approval by Nepra will be charged to consumers in January bill.
Under the tariff mechanism, changes in fuel cost are passed on to consumers only on a monthly basis through automatic mechanism and the QTA on account of variation in power purchase price, capacity charges, variable operation and maintenance costs, use of system charges and including impact of transmission and distribution losses are built in the base tariff by the federal government.
