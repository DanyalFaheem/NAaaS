0,Proposed amendments to PHC Act may impact independence,Draft proposes five slots in nine-member BoCs be given to health professionals that will give them numerical dominance.,"LAHORE: Health authorities have proposed amendments to the Punjab Healthcare Commission (PHC) Act of 2010, which may affect its ‘independence of the Board of Commissioners (BoCs)’, says an official.
The official said the Punjab Healthcare and Medical Education Department (PH&MED) proposed amendments to the Act to change the composition of the BoCs by abolishing the slots of the jurist (judge of the Lahore High Court, the financial expert and others).
The draft proposes that five slots in the nine-member BoCs be given to health professionals that will give numerical dominance to medical professionals in the commission, which may later be instrumental to pick blue-eyed chairman of the PHC.
It is being said the proposed composition of the BoCs will amount to “regulatory capture” as the healthcare service providers to be regulated by the Commission will become the final authority in the Commission.
This would amount to diminishing or compromising patients’ rights and inflict dent on the autonomy of the PHC, the official lamented.
The three-year term of the BoCs expires in January. 
The draft was recently presented at the meeting of the cabinet committee on legislative business, chaired by Punjab Law Minister Raja Basharat.
The official claims that many participants in the meeting objected to the proposal that the powers of the Commission to take action against health professionals and service providers be reviewed.
The official says this would diminish the authority of the commission to proceed against the violators of the Act.
Presently, the Commission can impose fine on delinquents. Also, the provisions to regulate prices of healthcare services are also being withdrawn under the proposed amendment Act.The official said the Punjab SHC&ME Department was already facing criticism under the definition of healthcare service provider being custodian of the major teaching hospitals. 
He said the status of the PHC may, therefore, be made consistent with the provisions of the PHC Act 2010 and to work under the Chief Minister’s secretariat instead of the health department.
The PHC was established in October 2011 in terms of the PHC Act, 2010, promulgated by the provincial legislature.
The primary objective of the PHC as a premier regulator in the health sector is to improve the quality of healthcare services and ban quackery in all its forms and manifestations.
The legal mandate of the PHC towards regulating the service delivery in the public and private healthcare establishments was enforced through prescribing minimum service delivery standards  and issuing regular license upon compliance with level specific.
The commission is empowered to adjudicate complaints against the healthcare service providers regarding medical negligence, etc.

1,LHC seeks Pemra report on media drive about smog,Judge directs PHA to initiate legislation on plantations in small plazas and on high-rises to control air pollution.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday sought a report from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) on public service messages in the media about smog. 
Justice Shahid Karim was hearing petitions questioning the failure of the government to implement the environmental laws. 
Earlier, the motorway police informed the court that 124,000 vehicles had been issued M-Tags during the last 10 days. 
The judge had ordered the police to ban entry of vehicles without M-Tag to the Lahore-Islamabad motorway as a measure to avoid long queues of the vehicles at the toll plazas that caused air pollution. 
Justice Karim directed the Parks & Horticulture Authority (PHA) to initiate legislation on plantations in small plazas and on high-rises to control air pollution. The judge also directed the PHA to ensure restoration of parks in the city. 
The judge expressed concern at smog in Lahore, saying even after the school holidays, the air quality index had not improved. He directed the government to take more steps against vehicular and industrial emissions. 
The judge noted that the mega development projects would further increase the heat densification in Lahore. 
The city traffic police sought time to submit a traffic plan in the city during cricket matches in March. 
The judge adjourned further hearing till Dec 29 and also directed Pemra to submit its report about the awareness campaign in the media regarding smog.

2,Dissolution clause violates apex court verdict on LG polls: LHC,"Judge questions delay in writing letter to ECP, seeks two-member bench to hear case.","LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday observed that the “dissolution clause” in the Punjab Local Government Ordinance 2021 was apparently in violation of the March 25 judgement of the Supreme Court which restored the suspended local governments in the province.  
Justice Shahid Jamil Khan was hearing petitions by several LG representatives who challenged different provisions of the new ordinance including the section 3, which envisages dissolution of the existing local governments on Jan 1, 2022.  
Punjab Secretary for Local Government Noorul Amin Mengal and government officials appeared before the court. Lord Mayor retired Col Mubashir Javed was also present.  
The judge grilled the secretary about delay in writing a letter to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to announce the LG polls in the province. He observed that the LG system would expire on Dec 31 and the government had not so far written to the ECP for the schedule of new polls.  

Judge questions delay in writing letter to ECP, seeks two-member bench to hear case

“This shows that the provincial government wants to run the system through its administrators,” the judge said, reminding the secretary that the administrator was just an administrative post and not a substitute for the LG system.
The secretary said rules for the delimitation process in the province had been sent to the ECP.  
Justice Khan also raised a question on the existence of section 3 of the ordinance being contrary to the SC judgement. The judge directed a counsel for the ECP to submit a detailed and clear reply on the matter.  
The judge referred the petitions to the chief justice with a request to fix the same before a two-judge bench since important questions of law had been raised by the petitioners.  
The petitioners submitted that the impugned ordinance envisaged dissolution of existing local bodies till Jan 1, 2022 and the use of the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the next polls in the province. They argued that the use of the EVMs without an approval from the ECP and deliberations by the political parties was an undemocratic decision of the government. They also challenged the appointment of administrators after the dissolution of the existing local government system.  
The petitioners said the provincial government with a mala fide intention was trying to bring a controlled system of local government according to its own whims. They said the impugned ordinance was in violation of various provisions of the Constitution and liable to be set aside.

4,‘No criminal case if ‘self’ cheque is dishonoured’,Court rules bearer can’t seek case unless there is endorsement in his favour.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has ruled that dishonouring a “self cheque” does not entitle its bearer to seek a criminal case under section 489-F of Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) until and unless there is an endorsement in his favour.
Justice Muhammad Shan Gul issued the ruling setting aside a decision of a justice of peace that ordered registration of a first information report against a petitioner on the basis of a “self” dishonoured cheque on which no endorsement in favour of the eventual bearer was recorded.  
In his ruling, the judge observes that section 154 of the CrPC mandates registration or recording of information relating to the commission of a cognisable offence and the information provided by an informant must allege the commission of a cognisable offence.
In case a cheque is made out to self only and there is no supporting evidence that the bearer was in fact a holder in due course of such a cheque, the commission of a cognisable offence cannot be established.

Court rules bearer can’t seek case unless there is endorsement in his favour 

Justice Gul holds that if the cheque is issued to “self” only, there will be no question of any offence.  
However, the problem arises when a cheque is issued to “self” but the same also allows the (unidentified) bearer to collect the proceeds and is presented by some person (since any bearer can present and get the cheque encashed) and upon its dishonour such person approaches the police for registration of FIR.  
In the case before the court the bearer of the cheque was the complainant and asserted the commission of offence without being anything on record to show that he himself was the creditor of the drawer of the cheque.  
Therefore, the judge observes, it cannot be ascertained without more that the drawer of the cheque intended that the complainant could present the cheque and hence there is nothing to indicate that the drawer had any intention to issue the cheque to the complainant let alone a dishonest intention and no evidence suggests that the complainant is creditor of the drawer either.
Allowing the petition, Justice Gul maintains that dishonouring a self cheque (even if the reference on the cheque to a bearer is not crossed) does not entitle a bearer to request for registration of a criminal case unless and until there is a positive endorsement in his favour either on the back of the cheque in question or by means of a separate document which would make the bearer a holder in due course.

5,Upgrade of grid stations: Rocketing project cost takes NTDC unit by surprise,LAHORE: The Project Management Unit (PMU) of the National Transmission & Dispatch Company (NTDC) has expressed...,"LAHORE: The Project Management Unit (PMU) of the National Transmission & Dispatch Company (NTDC) has expressed grave concern over drastic increase in the project cost for the upgrade of four 220kV grid stations and the recommendation for the award of projects to the ‘lowest bidders’ whose bid offer was already much higher than the actual cost mentioned in the PC-1.  
Since funding for the entire project (except one grid station) is being provided by the World Bank under a soft loan, the quarters concerned in the federal government have asked the NTDC management to submit the revised PC-1 of the project for approval, ignoring concerns of the procurement committee and others, Dawn has learnt. 
“I am surprised to see the efforts being made to award the project to bidders at Rs19.8 billion instead of the actual PC-1 cost of Rs5.6 billion,” an official source deplored on Thursday. “The PC-1 generally caters for all issues -- cost escalation due to inflation etc. But in this case, how it has jumped to four times more than the actual cost. It must be investigated in depth by a team of honest officers,” he demanded.  
According to a document available with Dawn, the PC-1 for the conversion of existing 220kV substations at Bund Road, Kala Shah Kaku, Ravi and Nishatabad to GIS technology was approved by ECNEC on March 17, 2017. “The existing 220kV grid stations are main source of power supply to major load centres for the areas of Lahore and Faisalabad Electric Supply Companies (Lesco & Fesco). These stations had been constructed in the 1960-70s and have completed their useful life after satisfactory operation of more than 30 to 40 years,” reads a letter NTDC’s PMU chief engineer Nisar Akhtar wrote to the company’s GM (Power System Planning). 
Owing to the ageing factor, the refurbishment / rehabilitation of the existing switchyards of these stations was planned through their conversion to the latest technology – Gas Insulated Substation -- in a bid to avert the operational issues. According to the letter, the approved PC-1 cost for these four substations’ rehabilitation was over Rs5.683 billion and the bid price offered was over Rs19.807 billion. 
In another letter, the PMU expressed concern over the issue and said it was not taken on board during change of the scope / preparation of engineer’s estimate and later (without consulting) it was approached for the revision of PC-1 after more than four years from the date of approval of the PC-1.  
“Therefore, you are required to submit detailed justification (related to cost revision). Please also arrange a meeting for an in-house detailed deliberation on the matter of drastic increase in the scope of work and cost,” the letter written to the GM concludes. 
On the other hand, the planning commission has asked the NTDC to submit the revised PC-1 of the project for approval.

He issued directions for imposing several conditions for issuance of no objection certificate (NOC) for the construction of commercial buildings and made it compulsory for petrol filling stations to have a portion for installing electric charging facility to get the NOC. 
The divisional committee reviewed the initial environmental examination (IEE) report and site inspection report arranged by the inspector (environment) and other supporting documents regarding the Judicial Employees Cooperative Housing Scheme in a meeting last week. 
The Divisional Environmental Approval Committee accorded approval for construction of the proposed project of six-storey plaza in the abovementioned scheme under Section-6 of the Punjab Environmental Protection (Delegation of Powers for Environmental Approvals) Rules 2017. 

They include 70pc green rooftop, EV charger facility in parking 

The approval for construction also imposed several conditions for getting the no objection certificate and they included compliance of Punjab Environmental Quality Standards (PEQS) and Rules and Regulations framed under the Punjab Environmental Protection Act 1997 (Amended), adherence to mitigation measures to minimise any negative impacts on soil, groundwater, air and biological resources of the project area, maintenance of record for verification of auditable adopted measures, monitoring during the entire period of the project activities and submission of monthly monitoring reports to the EPA.

9,Bahawalnagar gets only 13pc of quota as urea crisis worsens,Farmers take to the streets against fertiliser shortage,"BAHAWALNAGAR: The extent and severity of the urea shortage when the wheat crop needs it most can be gauged from the situation of the fertiliser in just one district that reveals a mammoth difference in the demand and supply. 
A report of the agriculture department on urea in Bahawalnagar has revealed that the daily requirement of the fertiliser in the district is approximately 2,000 metric tonnne (40,000 bags); however, the district received only 260 metric tonne urea (5,200 bags) on Dec 22, 87pc less than its fixed quota.  
The report (a copy available with Dawn) shows that tehsil Chishtian received 130 metric tonne (2,600 bags) of urea, tehsil Bahawalnagar 60 metric tonne (1,200 bags), Minchinabad 50 metric tonne (1,000bags), and Fort Abbas got 20 metric tonne (400 bags) on Wednesday. The tehsil Haroonabad did not get even a single bag of urea. 
Exasperated by the urea shortage and possibility of their toil for wheat crop going to waste, hundreds of farmers from the district took to the streets, staging a sit-in at the Minchinabad-Bahawalnagar Chowk on Thursday.  

Farmers take to the streets against fertiliser shortage  

Protesting against the urea shortage, they accused the mill owners of being responsible for the crisis and demanded the government ensure the required supply of urea to the district. They raised slogans against the mill owners, alleging that the mills had created the artificial shortage of urea by cutting its supply in an effort to hyke the price.  
The farmers said they had sown wheat crop but they were unable to get urea fertiliser despite efforts. They warned the district administration that the wheat crop would be adversely affected if the fertiliser crisis continued. They demanded the government take stern action against the mill owners and ensure the urea supply as per the requirement of the district. 
The agriculture and revenue officials held negotiations with the protesters who dispersed peacefully after getting assurance from the administration for steps to make urea available for them. 
According to media reports, the federal government earlier this month had decided to import urea 0.1 million metric tonne urea from China on a government-to-business basis to meet the shortfall in the country.  
Last month, the Punjab government had announced a crackdown on fertiliser hoarders and issued instructions to all divisional commissioners in this regard. However, it seems these steps did not help the government end the fertiliser shortage in Punjab.  
PUNISHMENTS: A Multan Electric Supply Company (Mepco) official has been terminated from service while 11 others have been awarded departmental punishments under Pakistan WAPDA Employees E&D Rules 1978 for corruption, negligence, and absence from duty. 
Various departmental inquiries were held by the Executive Engineer (Exen) Operation Mepco Bahawalnagar Fayyaz Qurban and they proved the charges against the officials.  
Mr Qurban told Dawn that Assistant Lineman Muhammad Amin Shahid, who was attached with Mepco headquarters, had been terminated from service after the allegations against him were proved in a departmental inquiry. 
One-year service of three Mepco officials – Lineman Muhammad Anwar, Assistant Lineman Shabbir Ahmed of Mcleod Ganj sub-division and Assistant Lineman Abdul Raouf of Madrassa sub-division – was forfeited in the light of inquiries, he added.

Police have booked Jalalpur Jattan MC Chairman Hashim Shah and two other suspects allegedly involved in the case. Ali Hassan, the municipal officer (finance), told police in his written complaint that two armed men namely Qaiser Saleem and Shahzad Butt alias Nona Butt stopped him outside his office and allegedly started thrashing him. He said the suspects continued to pressurise him to sign official documents as per the orders of the chairman.

They said the secretary had talked to the Gujrat deputy commissioner and the district police officer to take legal action against the assailants. 
It was learnt that the MO had declined to sign some official documents as per the ‘wish’ of the chairman and the officer had also informed the district administration and the LG secretary in writing about the pressure being exerted on him by the chairman. 
The tenure of elected representatives is set to complete by Dec 31 and the staff has been under immense pressure to sign documents prior to the limit. 
Hashim Shah had been elected as a councillor on PML-N ticket but later on he along with two other councillors joined the PML-Q to become chairman of Jalalpur Jattan MC in 2016.
