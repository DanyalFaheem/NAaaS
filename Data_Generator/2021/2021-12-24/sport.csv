0,New Zealand drop history man Ajaz for Bangladesh Tests,WELLINGTON: Ajaz Patel’s historic feat of taking 10 wickets in a Test innings was not enough to secure his place ...,"WELLINGTON: Ajaz Patel’s historic feat of taking 10 wickets in a Test innings was not enough to secure his place in New Zealand’s squad for a home series against Bangladesh. 
Off-spinner Patel became only the third player in Test history after England’s Jim Laker and India’s Anil Kumble to take all 10 wickets in an innings when he claimed 10-119 in the second Test against India earlier this month. 
But he was absent on Thursday from New Zealand’s 13-man squad for a two-Test series against Bangladesh, beginning on Jan 1, after being deemed surplus to requirements for matches on the greener surfaces of Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui and Hagley Oval in Christchurch. 
New Zealand coach Gary Stead expressed sympathy for Patel, who has failed to take a wicket in three Tests on home soil, despite his heroics in India. 
“You do feel for Ajaz after his record-breaking display in India,” he said in a statement. “However, we’ve always applied a horses-for-courses selection policy and believe the 
players selected best fit the way we want to take on Bangladesh here at home.” 
All-rounders Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell can offer spin but New Zealand’s main focus will be on moving the ball at pace with seamers Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Neil Wagner, Kyle Jamieson and Matt Henry all selected. 
“We feel having both Rachin and Daryl in the squad gives us a nice balance and the ability to pick a side best suited to the conditions we expect,” Stead said. 
Tom Latham will captain New Zealand in the absence of Kane Williamson, who suffered a recurrence of an elbow injury in India and will miss both Tests. 
“It’s obviously disappointing not to have Kane available for this series but, as we noted in India, he is undergoing a sustained period of rest followed by rehabilitation, strengthening and gradual batting loading,” Stead said. “We have every confidence in Tom leading the side. He’s done an excellent job in the past when called upon.” 
Free-scoring opener Devon Conway returns to the squad, however, after missing the 1-0 series loss in India because of a broken hand sustained when he punched his bat in frustration during the Twenty20 World Cup. 
The series opens at Bay Oval on New Year’s Day and will be New Zealand’s first home Test since they won the World Test Championship by beating India in England earlier this year. 
The Black Caps are unbeaten in eight home Test series going back to their last reverse, a 1-0 loss to South Africa in March 2017. 
Squad: Tom Latham (captain), Devon Conway, Will Young, Ross Taylor, Henry Nicholls, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Blundell, Rachin Ravindra, Kyle Jamieson, Matt Henry, Tim Southee, Neil Wagner, Trent Boult.

1,Inter Milan end year with seventh straight win,"ROME: Seven straight wins. Six straight without conceding. Eleven straight unbeaten. 

Inter Milan concluded the ...","ROME: Seven straight wins. Six straight without conceding. Eleven straight unbeaten. 
Inter Milan concluded the year with a 1-0 win over Torino on Wednesday to confirm their control of Serie A and intention of securing consecutive titles. 
While Inter had already secured the lead for the seasons halfway point entering the holiday break, it was a welcome victory a day after the club’s offices were raided by finance police amid an ongoing investigation into false accounting. 
Denzel Dumfries scored from the edge of area to conclude a counterattack after taking a backheel pass from Edin Dzeko during the first half at the San Siro. It was the third goal in four matches for the Netherlands right-back. 
“We’re happy with how we’ve ended the year. It’s easy for everyone to say that Inter is the favorite but that wasn’t the case in the summer,” first-year Inter coach Simone Inzaghi said, recalling the doubts surrounding the club following the departures of previous coach Antonio Conte and standout players Romelu Lukaku and Achraf Hakimi. “The club did well to get players useful for my style of play.” 
AC Milan stayed in touch with the summit, a 4-2 win at Empoli moving them into second after Napoli’s shock 1-0 home defeat to struggling Spezia. 
Stefano Pioli’s side stayed four points behind city rivals Inter heading into the winter break thanks to Franck Kessie’s first-half brace and further goals from Alessandro Florenzi and Theo Hernandez. 
The win allowed Milan to reclaim second spot from Napoli after their controversial loss at the hands of Luciano Spalletti’s team at the weekend and leaves the seven-time European champions as the principle pretenders to Inter’s Serie A crown. 
“Every win is worth three points but there are moments in the season when certain victories have a bigger impact than others and tonight was one of them so I’m very happy,” said Pioli to DAZN. 
Milan are three points ahead of third-placed Napoli who, still afflicted by a host of absences, were sunk by a Juan Jesus own goal in the 37th minute which ended Spezia’s run of six matches without a win and moves them five points away from the relegation zone in 17th. 
A fine team display in Tuscany meanwhile blew away some of the dark clouds hovering over Milan following their humiliating flop in the Champions League and just two wins in their previous seven league matches which allowed red-hot Inter to take the initiative in the title race. 
Kessie opened the scoring with a first-time strike from Olivier Giroud’s lay-off in the 12th minute but it looked like it would be another uncomfortable night for Milan when Nedim Bajrami levelled only six minutes later. 
However Kessie, who was denied a last-gasp equaliser against Napoli by VAR on Sunday, reestablished the away side’s lead shortly before the break with a low drive from a tight angle which fizzed between Guglielmo Vicario’s legs. 
Two quick-fire strikes midway through the second ensured the points for Milan, with Florenzi scoring his first Rossoneri goal from a 63rd-minute free-kick before Hernandez lashed home the fourth from close range. 
Andrea Pinamonti’s penalty six minutes form the end made no difference to the result. 
AS Roma missed the chance to close the gap on the Champions League places after a 1-1 draw with Sampdoria at the Stadio Olimpico. 
Jose Mourinho’s side thought they were set to move four points behind fourth-placed Atalanta when Eldor Shomurodov drilled home the opener in the 72nd minute. 
But Manolo Gabbiadini snatched a point with his fifth goal in as many matches eight minutes later to move Samp nine clear of the relegation zone and leave Roma sixth on 32 points. 
The capital club are level with Fiorentina who sit seventh after only managing a 1-1 draw at Verona, with Kevin Lasagna giving the hosts a 17th minute lead before Gaetano Castrovilli levelled nine minutes from the end with a spectacular diving header. 
Lazio won 3-1 at Venezia despite missing striker Ciro Immobile, who has the coronavirus. Pedro, Francesco Acerbi and Luis Alberto scored for the Roman club. 
Also, Bologna won 3-0 at Sassuolo with goals from Riccardo Orsolini, Aaron Hickey and Federico Santander.

2,Benzema brace as Real round off year  on a high,BARCELONA: Karim Benzema struck two quick goals to lead Real Madrid to a 2-1 win at Athletic Bilbao in a game ...,"BARCELONA: Karim Benzema struck two quick goals to lead Real Madrid to a 2-1 win at Athletic Bilbao in a game missing several players because of coronavirus infections on Wednesday to send Carlo Ancelotti’s side into the winter break eight points clear atop La Liga. 
As Real ended the year with a bang, city rivals and defending champions Atletico Madrid suffered a 2-1 reverse at Granada, their fourth straight defeat — their worst run in the competition since Diego Simeone took charge a decade ago, to leave them fifth but a yawning 17 points adrift. 
A total of 12 players between Real and Bilbao missed the game after testing positive for Covid-19. That included Real midfielder Luka Modric and Bilbao’s Unai Simon, the goalkeeper for Spain’s national side. 
Benzema started the scoring for the league leaders with a superb strike four minutes into the match at San Mames. He struck again in the seventh for his league-leading 15th goal of the season. 
Oihan Sancet pulled one back with his speedy 10th minute reply which hit the woodwork before evading Thibaut Cortois. 
Inaki Williams went close to grabbing an equaliser with a half-hour to play, but a defense anchored by Eder Militao held on to increase Real’s lead to eight points over second-placed Sevilla. 
The outbreak on Madrid’s squad gave Eden Hazard, Eduardo Camavinga, and Nacho Fernandez the opportunity to earn rare starts. 
“I want to highlight the players who hadn’t played much were ready to go, that is the strength of a team that wants to compete,” said Ancelotti, whose side enters the winter break on a 15-game unbeaten streak in all competitions. “Now to rest and get back those players who weren’t with us today... I think that we can have them all back after the holidays.” 
Earlier Atltico’s shaky defence of their La Liga crown took another big hit with injured duo Antoine Griezmann and Stefan Savic absent. 
Atletico would be more than happy to swop trajectories with Granada for whom this was a third consecutive win in front of their home fans and their fifth game without loss. 
This was certainly not how Simeone envisaged the night before his 10th year anniversary in charge at Atletico. 
What’s more his Portuguese striker Joao Felix had Granada on the backfoot in the second minute when his low angled shot got the better of his fellow countryman Luis Maximiano. 
Venezuelan forward Darwin Machis levelled in the 17th minute. 
Felix had a header arguably harshly disallowed as the first half drew to a close with Jorge Molina grabbing the winner after the hour mark for Granada. 
“We are not getting the wins like we used to,” Simeone said. “Many times we won games we did not deserve to win, now we are losing games we deserved to win. Lapses in concentration in the little details is costing us games.”

3,"Chelsea, Liverpool and Tottenham reach League  Cup semis",LONDON: Antonio Conte will have to overcome former club Chelsea to reach the League Cup final early in his Tottenham...,"LONDON: Antonio Conte will have to overcome former club Chelsea to reach the League Cup final early in his Tottenham Hotspur career, and he wants to do it in one match. 
The semi-finals, beginning in two weeks, are still due to be over two legs despite the upsurge in coronavirus cases wiping out games and creating a fixture pile-up. 
Tottenham, runners-up to Manchester City last season, overcame West Ham United 2-1 and Chelsea beat Brentford 2-0 on Wednesday before being paired together in the last four that will see Arsenal also play Liverpool. 
“If I have to decide maybe it would be to play one game and not two games, especially I repeat for the situation we are living but we have to respect the rules,” Conte said. “For sure it will be nice and good to play against Chelsea for me. I spent two amazing seasons with Chelsea (2016-18) and I enjoyed a lot and everything there, but now I am the manager of Tottenham and I am ready to give everything for this club.” 
Juergen Klopp would gladly give up home advantage to also see Liverpool not have to play two games for the semi-finals in the first two weeks of 2022 given the lack of winter break and packed festive program stretching the squad. 
Liverpool were taken to penalties by Leicester in Wednesday’s other quarter-final, prevailing 5-4 in the shootout after the game ended 3-3 after 90 minutes. 
The three goals at Totte­nham came in a five-minute spell. Steven Bergwijn slotted in from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg’s cut back for his first goal of the season but West Ham levelled through Jarrod Bowen’s well-taken goal. Bergwijn then set up Lucas Moura for the winner. 
Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel handed debuts to academy prospects Har­vey Vale, Jude Soon­sup-Bell and Xavier Simons with the Blues short of seven players due to a Covid outbreak. An own goal 10 minutes from time by Pontus Jansson broke the deadlock at Brentford before a Jorginho penalty sealed victory. 
In a thriller at Anfield, a weakened Liverpool side came back from the brink to beat Leicester. 
Jamie Vardy’s early double gave Leicester a 2-0 lead and James Maddison’s rocket shot made it 3-1 after Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had pulled a goal back. 
But Diogo Jota struck in the 68th minute before Takumi Minamino levelled in the sixth minute of stoppage time. 
Minamino then spurned a chance to send Liverpool through in the ensuing penalty shoot-out as he blazed his effort over the bar. But Liverpool keeper Caoimhin Kelleher then saved Ryan Bertrand’s effort, his second save of the shoot-out, before Jota converted to win it for Liverpool.

Mauricio Pochettino’s side, who had Sergio Ramos sent off, have 46 points from 19 games with Nice in second place 13 points behind after a 2-1 comeback win at home against RC Lens with Mario Lemina and Justin Kluivert scoring their goals after Arnaud Kalimuendo had put the away side ahead. 
Third-placed Olympique de Marseille, who have a game in hand, trail Nice on goal difference after being caught cold at the Velodrome in a 1-1 draw against Stade de Reims, Dimitri Payet salvaging a point with a penalty eight minutes into injury time. 
Stade Rennais are fourth on 31 points after a 2-1 defeat at Monaco with Wissam Ben Yedder’s penalty cancelling out Martin Terrier’s opener for the away team before German international Kevin Volland scored the winner. 
Elsewhere, Montpellier consolidated their fifth place with a convincing 4-1 home victory against mid-table Angers and champions Lille moved up to eighth when Jonathan David’s late goal gave them a 3-2 victory at Girondins de Bordeaux. 
Struggling Olympique Lyonnais were held 1-1 at home by Metz, and the game between Clermont and Racing Strasbourg was postponed because of foggy conditions. 
In their final outing of 2021, PSG trailed in Brittany to Thomas Monconduit’s thunderous first-half strike for Lorient. 
Pochettino brought on former Real Madrid defender Ramos after the break, but he was sent off five minutes from the end for a second yellow card. 
With 10-man PSG pouring forward, right back Achraf Hakimi clipped over a great cross from the right and Icardi expertly headed home in the first minute of injury time. 
The result left Lorient second from bottom on 16 points, four ahead of St Etienne who were beaten 1-0 at home by Nantes. 
The French top flight shuts down for a short winter break before returning on January 7.

7,US cricketers stun Ireland in historic game,LAUDERHILL: The United States scored a famous and deserved T20 cricket triumph over Ireland on Wednesday to get the...,"LAUDERHILL: The United States scored a famous and deserved T20 cricket triumph over Ireland on Wednesday to get the most important series in their history off to the best possible start. 
A brilliant 65 from Guyanese-born Gajanand Singh helped the hosts reach a competitive 188-6 in their 20 overs and some disciplined bowling from Saurabh Netravalkar and Ali Khan helped keep the Irish at bay to secure a 26-run in the first of two Twenty20 Internationals, the first US home series ever against a Test playing nation. 
The US, wanting to compete at the very highest level, will need more performances like this to stand them in good stead moving forward. 
Ireland had never lost to an American side coming into the clash, thrashing them four times in T20 World Cup qualifier tournaments from 2010 to 2015. 
But the visitors were distinctly second best in Florida as the US notched their best-ever win against a Test playing nation in the Twenty20 format. 
“This is a good start,” spinner Nisarg Patel, who bowled well in taking 2-27, said. “We’ve been playing well for the last year and a half. Winning against bigger teams like Ireland will send out a good message across the country and the world. Hopefully we can keep it going.” 
Ireland are scheduled to play another Twenty20 game against the US and three ODIs before a tour the Caribbean to face West Indies in three ODIs in January. 
Reaching the World Cup in either format, as well as possibly competing in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, remains the US aim while moves are well underway to establish an American professional competition, Major League Cricket, within the next two years. 
Young players are also being produced, with 18-year-old Ritwk Behera, born in Rockville, Maryland, and New Jersey native Yasir Mohammad the only players in the starting XI at the Broward County Stadium who were born in the United States. 
Skipper Patel’s side were desperate to make a strong start and show the lively couple of hundred fans in attendance as well as the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport’s global governing body, the team was deserving of future high-profile series. 
Early stages against a new look Ireland side, aiming to bounce back from a disappointing T20 World Cup showing, were a struggle for the US team, which slumped to 16 for four quickly, which included losing captain Patel to the second ball of the match. 
But a brilliant fifth-wicket stand between Singh and Sushant Modani helped turn the tide for the hosts. Their partnership of 110 saw Singh lay into an Irish bowling attack that seemed to alarmingly wilt in the Florida sun. 
Singh smacked the first six of the match in the 12th over — a sign of just how slow the US came out of the blocks — and proceeded to hit four more maximums in a splendid, crucial innings of 65. 
Modani weighed in with an equally important 50 before Marty Kain, one of five debutants for the home side, crushed a quick-fire 39 from only 15 balls to reach a very competitive target. 
Ireland bowler Barry McCarthy did most of the early damage, taking three of the four early US wickets and four overall for 30 runs. 
The new Ireland opening partnership of Paul Stirling and captain Andrew Balbirnie started quickly. Balbirnie smacked a boundary through cover off his first ball, and Stirling playing a powerful cut shot to the boundary a few balls later. 
But US fast bowler Muhammad Ali Khan struck first, tempting Balbirnie into a hook shot and he holed out at deep square leg in the second over. 
Stirling struck a rapid 31 for Ireland as they reached 41-1 but when he was bowled by Netravalkar in the fifth over, the Irish innings ran out of steam. 
Despite Lorcan Tucker’s unbeaten 57, Ireland lost wickets regularly and could not gather any momentum as the US kept a tight grip on proceedings. 
When William McClintock was bowled by Ali Khan in the 18th over there was no way back for Ireland who finished on 162-6. 
Summarised scores: 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 188-6 (G.Singh 65, S.Modani 50, M.Kain 39; B. McCarthy 4-30) beat IRELAND 162-6 (L. Tucker 57*, P.Stirling 31, S.Getkate 19; S.Netravalkar 2-26) by 26 runs.

8,Two Boxing Day Premier League games off due to Covid cases,"“The league is aware that the decision to postpone these two matches will disappoint supporters,"" says Premier League statement.","LONDON: Coronavirus outbreaks at Leeds United and Watford have led to two Premier League matches scheduled for Sunday being postponed in the latest disruption to the competition caused by cases rising in squads. 
Leeds were due to travel to Liverpool and Watford were set to play at Wolverhampton Wanderers as part of the Boxing Day programme that still features seven games. 
The Premier League has now called off 12 matches due to coronavirus issues in two weeks, with players having to isolate after testing positive or if they are unvaccinated and a close contact of a Covid-19 case. 
“The league is aware that the decision to postpone these two matches will disappoint supporters and understands their frustrations at a special time of year when fans look forward to attending and watching football games,” the Premier League said in a statement on Thursday. 
Games are also being wiped out lower down the leagues, with six of Sunday’s 10 matches in the second-tier Championship postponed. 
The Leeds training ground has been closed to contain the spread of the coronavirus, with five new positive cases among the squad and staff reported on Thursday. 
“All of the cases we have experienced are asymptomatic which we believe is due to our high vaccine take-up,” Leeds said. “The positive cases, combined with our well-documented injury issues, means that we would not have enough recognised first-team players to meet the Premier League requirements for the fixture.” 
Watford told the league that with players coming out of isolation they expect to be able to play West Ham United on Tuesday. 
Everton’s request for their match against Burnley to be postponed has been rejected despite being without 11 players due to injury or Covid infection. 
The situation is worse in the lower divisions with four second-tier Championship games scheduled for Boxing Day postponed due to Covid-19 cases while 11 games in League One and League Two were also called off. 
Confirmed coronavirus cases in Britain, where the omicron variant is now dominant, have surged by almost 60% in a week. 
After recording a record 90 positive cases last week, the Premier League urged players to get vaccinated with 16% yet to receive a single dose. While more than 90% of players in Italy’s Serie A and Spain’s La Liga have been fully vaccinated, the Premier League said Monday that only 77% of its players were doubled jabbed. 
No restrictions have yet been put in place for the size of crowds at matches in England, although supporters do have to provide proof of vaccination or a negative test taken in the previous 48 hours. 
Sport in Wales will be forced back behind closed doors from December 26, while in Scotland a restriction of 500 for outdoor public events from the same day has seen Scottish Premiership clubs bring forward their winter break by a week.

9,Pakistan opener Abid Ali on road to recovery after heart scare,He is one of several sports figures to have suffered cardiac problems recently.,"KARACHI: Pakistan Test opener Abid Ali faces a long road to recovery following surgery after he was forced off the field with chest pain during a domestic match, officials said on Thursday.
The 34-year-old fell ill Tuesday while batting for Central Punjab in a Quaid-e-Azam Trophy match in Karachi and was rushed to a hospital.
He underwent two angioplasty procedures after being diagnosed with Acute Coronary Syndrome, a Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) statement said.
“Abid has commenced rehabilitation... did light walking in the morning without showing any discomfort,” it said, adding he is likely to be discharged next week.
The stocky Abid made headlines in December 2019 when he became the first batsman to hit a century on debut at both Test and one-day international levels.
His ODI hundred came against Australia in Dubai in March 2019, while the Test century was scored against Sri Lanka at Rawalpindi nine months later.
Abid has so far scored 1,180 runs in 16 Tests, and played six ODIs for Pakistan.
He is one of several sports figures to have suffered cardiac problems recently.
They include Danish footballer Christian Eriksen, who suffered a cardiac arrest during a European Championship match in June.
Pakistan’s next Test series is at home against Australia in March next year.

10,"‘Positive outcome’ expected as PFF NC, IPC ministry meet","“We are in talks with the government,” says a member of the FIFA-appointed PFF NC in a brief statement.","KARACHI/LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: A four-hour meeting between the Ministry of Inter-provincial Coordination and the Pakistan Football Federation Normalisation Committee ended on Thursday with both parties claiming a resolution to the crisis that has seen Pakistan suspended by global football body FIFA since April is just a week away. 
“We are in talks with the government,” Shahid Khokhar, a member of the FIFA-appointed PFF NC, said in a brief statement after the meeting in Islamabad. “Things are moving rapidly in the right direction and we expect a positive outcome for Pakistan football very soon.” 
With IPC minister Dr Fehmida Mirza unable to attend, Federal Minister for Planning and Develo­pment Asad Umar chaired the meeting in which the PFF NC was led by chairman Haroon Malik, who had been in Canada since the FIFA banned Pakistan. 
The suspension came after the PFF headquarters were seized by the PFF led by Ashfaq Hussain Shah, which came into power after an election of the country’s football governing body held by the Supreme Court in December 2019. Ashfaq and his officials claimed that the NC was not keen on holding fresh elections of the PFF, which has been mired in dispute since 2015. 
With the PFF NC thrown out of office, FIFA said Pakistan would remain suspended until the headquarters were returned to it’s appointed committee gets control of the headquarters. 
Pakistan Sports Board director general retired Col Asif Zaman, who also attended Thursday’s meeting, hoped that the FIFA suspension would soon be lifted. 
“All we want is a transparent election,” he told Dawn. “The PFF NC has been asked to submit a roadmap for the elections and as soon as it’s given, the PFF headquarters will be handed over to the NC.” 
The headquarters are currently in possession of the Lahore district administration, which evicted Ashfaq’s PFF for what initially emerged as a failure to pay its three-year lease. 
However, Dawn learnt on Thursday that the lease agreement that the PFF had with the Punjab government could be cancelled after the previous PFF had entered into a subletting agreement with General Electronics. 
The land acquired for the PFF headquarters, the government contends, was to be used for “sporting purposes” only with no commercial activity allowed.

11,Paul Collingwood to stand in as England coach for T20s in West Indies,Marcus Tres­c­othick will be joining Collingwood as an assistant coach.,"LONDON: Former Eng­land captain Paul Collin­gwood will stand in as head coach for England’s five-match Twenty20 Intern­ational series against West Indies next month, the country’s cricket board (ECB) said on Thursday. 
Regular head coach Chris Silverwood will take a break following the ongoing Ashes series against Aust­ralia, with Marcus Tres­c­othick joining Collingwood as an assistant coach. Eoin Morgan will captain the squad. 
Collingwood was at the T20 World Cup earlier this year with England before going to the Ashes, but flew back to Britain last week. 
Of the 16 players named in the squad, 11 travelled to the World Cup, with left-arm seamer David Payne and all-rounder George Garton the only uncapped players included. 
“We have selected a strong squad with some serious batting power and a balanced attack as we begin preparations ahead of the T20 World Cup in Australia,” Collingwood said. 
“The World Cup is less than a year away and there will be increased opportunities for the squad in the absence of those players who are with the Ashes squad.” 
The series will begin on Jan 22 and will conclude on Jan 30. 
Squad: Eoin Morgan (captain), Moeen Ali, Tom Banton, Sam Billings, Liam Dawson, George Garton, Chris Jordan, Liam Living­stone, Saqib Mahmood, Tymal Mills, David Payne, Adil Rashid, Jason Roy, Phil Salt, Reece Topley, James Vince.

12,England haven’t given up on Ashes: Dawid Malan,The top-order batsman said morale in the England camp was “fine” after some honest discussions after Adela­ide.,"MELBOURNE: England are “hurting” but determined to rise to the challenge and claw their way back into the Ashes series against Australia, batsman Dawid Malan said on Thursday. 
After slumping by nine wickets in Brisbane and then by 275 runs in Adelaide, the visitors will enter the Melbourne Cricket Ground cauldron for the third Test on Sunday needing to win.
If they don’t, the five-Test series is over with Australia retaining the urn as holders. 
The top-order batsman said morale in the England camp was “fine” after some honest discussions after Adela­ide, where a first-innings batting collapse coupled with poor bowling and fielding cost England the match. 
“The boys are hurting after our performances in the last two games,” he told reporters at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Thursday. “We realise we haven’t been good enough across all facets of the game.  
“Speaking to all the guys, everyone is up for the challenge, everyone is really keen to face up to the Australians. The boys want to win, we want to win the series too. 
“I know it’s a long way for us to come but we have to do well and play our best cricket in this Test match to get ourselves back into the series.” 
The odds are against them — the only instance of a team coming from 2-0 down to win the Ashes was Donald Bradman’s Australia way back in 1936-37. 
Malan and captain Joe Root have been the only two English batsmen to excel, both hitting half-centuries in Brisbane and Adelaide, but unable to go on and make a big score. 
Malan’s batting has provided some of the rare highlights for England with an innings of 82 in Brisbane and 80 in Adelaide, but the 34-year-old conceded even he had to be better. 
“Myself and [Joe Root] have been in the position to score hundreds in two innings and haven’t been able to kick on which has probably cost us about a hundred runs as a team at least, and that gets us back in the game,” said the South African-born Malan, who has hit nine Test 50s but only converted one into a century. “Scoring 80’s good, scoring 180’s brilliant, so that’s the goal.” 
With England’s openers Rory Burns and Haseeb Hameed struggling for runs, there has been talk of bringing fresh blood in at the top of the order, most notably Zak Crawley. 
“Zak’s a very talented player,” said Malan. “He’s a tall bloke who plays the short ball really well so there’s every chance that he’ll be really good here.” 
Malan said he would even consider moving up the order to open himself, if asked. 
He suggested that England’s travails against a high-quality attack was also down to a lack of Test experience on Australian pitches, with he and Root among the few to have played an away Ashes series before. 
“We are almost learning on the job in Test matches because a lot of the guys haven’t played in Australia, so they are facing bowlers they’ve never faced before and getting used to the bounce out here,” he said. 
“But everyone’s up for a challenge, everyone’s really keen to face up to the Australians. We do it in white ball cricket, we try and take them on, so hopefully we can get that mindset and not just go into our shells and try and survive.”

13,Olivier hoping to make up for lost time with SA,PRETORIA: Duanne Olivier believes he has returned to South African cricket a more mature and complete bowler as he...,"PRETORIA: Duanne Olivier believes he has returned to South African cricket a more mature and complete bowler as he looks to make what almost amounts to a second international debut in the first Test against India at Centurion Park on Sunday.
Olivier exploded on to the Test scene four years ago and took 48 wickets in 10 Tests at an average below 20, but then took up a Kolpak contract with English county Yorkshire that meant he was lost to South African cricket.
At the time it seemed highly unlikely he would play for the national side again, and in fact spoke about qualifying to play for England instead in what was termed a  “family decision” to relocate. He even had his South African Test cap framed for display.
But after returning home when the Kolpak system fell away due to the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, Olivier showed excellent form and finished the top wicket-taker in the domestic four-day competition.
The 29-year-old is now set to replace the injured Anrich Nortje in the South Africa side to face the touring Indians in the first of three Tests.
“The UK helped me a lot in perfecting that fuller length that every bowler wants to bowl,” Olivier told reporters.  “I’m still working on it and I am not going to get it right every single time but the three years I spend in the UK helped me immensely. People thought I only bowl short and fair enough, I did that, but now I feel like I have a different element to my game.”
His return has not been without raised eyebrows. There are some that feel that having turned his back on the side in 2019, he should not be welcomed back.
“I know people will have mixed feelings about it, but at the end of the day, it’s OK. You handle that and you deal with those pressures or the criticism that comes with that,” he says.
Olivier took 5-57 on debut against Sri Lanka in 2017. Will there be the same nerves this time round?   “Wherever I play, I’m always nervous,” he says.  “If it’s my first over, I am very nervous. I’ll have a different feeling this time. Maybe it might be similar to a debut because I haven’t played for three years.
“If I’m selected to play, I think my nerves will be shot through the roof.”

14,"No runs, no worries for Australia opener Harris","MELBOURNE: Just as well, Marcus Harris has a friend in high places — Australia cricket coach Justin Langer....","MELBOURNE: Just as well, Marcus Harris has a friend in high places — Australia cricket coach Justin Langer. 
Harris, the beleaguered Australian Test opener, has 14 consecutive dismissals without reaching a half-century. His Test average of 22.19 is the lowest of all regular Australian openers in 128 years. 
In four innings against England in this Ashes series, the 29-year-old Harris has scored just 38 runs and is the one specialist batter in the Australia team who did not thrive as the hosts secured big wins in the first two Tests in Brisbane and Adelaide. His Test total against England is even worse, averaging just 10.66 with the bat. 
That apparently isn’t enough for Langer to consider replacing Harris as opener with David Warner for the Boxing Day Test beginning from Sunday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground despite the fact that Usman Khawaja, who many want to see open in Harris place, has two centuries in the five Tests he has appeared as an opener, totaling 484 runs at an average of 96.8. 
“He’ll play in the test, no worries about that,” Langer told reporters. “This is his home ground, he’s played a lot at the MCG. He hasn’t made the runs he’d liked to at the moment but ... he knows how to play.  
“He hasn’t made the runs he’d like to so far, but he dominates domestic cricket. For him, for us, we’re hoping he plays well and gets a good partnership with Davy Warner in this Boxing Day Test match.” 
Langer and Harris are close friends from their days together in Western Australia state. 
“That’s absolutely one of the most important things in life, knowing people have got your back,” Langer said. 
Langer, an opener who played 105 Tests for Australia, endured similar periods where his position was in question and said it was important to support players. 
“We like to back our players in, where we can,” he added. “It’s a tough gig, opening in test cricket, but we’re really confident Marcus has got what it takes to be a successful Australian opening batsman.” 
Warner has had multiple opening partners during his 10-year Test career and finding a long-term partner for him has been a problem since Chris Rogers’ retirement after the 2015 Ashes. 
“My experience, when Steve Waugh, Ricky Ponting, Mark Taylor or Allan Border said ‘you’re in the team’, you feel like Superman,” said Langer.  
“You feel like you’re important to the team and Marcus Harris is important to the team.” 
With Harris a confirmed starter, Australia’s only question mark is over their bowling unit. 
Pat Cummins and fellow fast bowler Josh Hazle­wood will return to the squad later on Thursday after missing the second Test in Adelaide, which Australia won by 275 runs. 
Cummins has completed health protocols after being deemed a close contact of a Covid-19 case and is sure to resume the captaincy but Hazlewood will need to prove he has recovered from a side strain sustained in the series opener. 
Michael Neser and Jhye Richardson replaced the duo in Adelaide, while uncapped paceman Scott Boland was brought into the squad as cover on Tuesday, and Langer said he was undecided on the make-up of the bowling attack for Melbourne. 
“Both Michael and Jhye did a great job in the last Test match,” he added. “We’ve got five Test matches in a row, we’ll just manage our bowlers as best we can and we’ll put our fittest and our most ready to perform out on the park in Melbourne.” 
There were also concerns over Mitchell Starc after he was injured while batting in Adelaide, but Langer thought the left-arm quick would be ready to go on Sunday. 
“I’d be very surprised if he didn’t get up for the Boxing Day test. He should be fine, he’s tough. If he’s not right, we’ll look at it, but at this stage there’s no indication he won’t be available,” said Langer.
