6,‘Nepotism in award of tickets caused PTI’s defeat in Kohat’,Disgruntled activist Shafi Jan urges PM to probe the matter,"KOHAT: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf disgruntled activist Shafi Jan who secured 25,783 votes as an independent candidate in Dec 19 polls for the Kohat tehsil chairman slot has demanded of Prime Minister Imran Khan to call the workers to know the truth about nepotism in the award of tickets.
Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, he said that a wealthy party leader Shahbaz Gul Shinwari was made president of Southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa though he had supported independents in 2013 and 2018 general elections, and in 2015 local body polls.
Shafi Jan said he secured more votes than the PTI ticket-holder Suleman Shinwari who got 15,219 votes though Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl candidate won the election for the tehsil top slot.
Shahbaz Shinwari had fielded his son Suleman Shinwari against the wishes of the district leadership for the tehsil top slot.

Shafi Jan regretted that PTI cancelled his party membership and had suspended membership of 20 other leaders.
He explained that workers were so annoyed that they put pressure on the disgruntled aspirants to contest the elections as independents and the result was before the party.
He held responsible the leaders for nepotism in the distribution of tickets, demanding strict action against them.
He lamented that the party leaders distributed the tickets among their relatives and challenged the stance that a parliamentary board was constituted for the purpose.
Shafi Jan recalled that his late father Saadullah Khan had laid the foundation of PTI in Kohat in 2000 when nobody knew it and invited Imran Khan for a rally in 2003.

7,Return of Tirah displaced families to begin in March,Tribal elder says damaged houses need immediate repair,"KHYBER: Return of thousands of internally displaced families to different parts of Tirah valley will begin in March next year after completion of their registration.
Officials said that a meeting held at Khyber House on Thursday with Deputy Commissioner Mansoor Arshad in the chair decided to facilitate return of the displaced families belonging to Kukikhel, Sipah, Malakdinkhel, Kamarkhel and Qambarkhel in March next year.
The meeting was also attended by elders of various tribes including Malak Naseer Ahmad, Malak Noor Zahir, Malak Taimur, Malak Khalid Akbar and others. Security officials stationed in different parts of Tirah, especially Rajgal, Kukikhel, also attended the meeting.
The government allowed return of a limited number of Kukikhel families in July this year after repeated demands of the displaced families for their return since 2015 when most of the displaced people returned to their homes in Tirah valley.

Tribal elder says damaged houses need immediate repair

Malak Noor Zahir, a Kukikhel elder, said that around 350 families were sent back to Zarmanza, Korhang and Karwarha villages in the first phase of the repatriation of the displaced members of the tribe.
More than 15,000 Kukikhel families were forced to vacate their house in 2012 when militants occupied their area, situated near the Afghan border, and a military operation was launched against them.
Security officials had on a number of occasions claimed to have ‘cleansed’ the Kukikhel region of militants but the displaced families were not allowed to go back to their homes.
The announcement of the first phase of their return, however, was made after the affected families held a three-month long protest sit-in at the historic Bab-i-Khyber in Jamrud early this year for the acceptance of their demands.
Malak Noor Zahir said that the first phase of their return completed in October while nearly 6,000 Kukikhel families would go back to their houses in March next year in Mehraban Kallay, Tangu, Thor Darra, Khaisth Khula, Madarkhel Kallay, Sra Waila, Serhai, Seekh Kot, Sur Kas, Wachay Wany, Zerry Gut and Barra Gut. “Most of the houses are damaged and require immediate repair,” he added.
The remaining Sipah, Malakdinkhel, Qambarkhel and Kamarkhel families belonging to Bara tehsil will also return to their homes during the same period after completion of their registration process.

She declared that after completion of half of the prison term of the convict he should be released on probation for good conduct and be placed under the care of his father by executing a single surety bond of Rs50,000.

The judge directed that a copy of the judgment should be sent to the KP Chief Secretary and secretary home to ensure compliance of detention of the convict in a juvenile rehabilitation centre.
The FIR of the occurrence was registered at Mathra police station on Aug 10, 2019, on complaint of the victim’s father under section 377 PPC and section 53 of the KP Child Protection and Welfare Act.

12,Air quality monitoring stations proposed for major cities in KP,The initiative is meant to assess preparedness at provincial and district levels to handle emergency situations.,"PESHAWAR: The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has prepared the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Winter Contingency Plan calling for the establishment of air quality monitoring stations in major cities of the province.
According to the PDMA, the initiative is meant to assess preparedness at provincial and district levels to handle emergency situations.
A report carrying details of the contingency plan has declared snowfall, low temperature, fog and smog, landslides and heavy rainfalls as major winter hazards in the province.
According to it, Peshawar, Charsadda, Mardan, Nowshera, Swabi, Lakki Marwat and Dera Ismail Khan districts face the smog issue in the winter season.

PDMA declares snowfall, downpours, landslides, smog, low temperature major winter challenges

“Smog is one of the severe health hazards. It can be fatal for human health, especially children’s,” it said.
The PDMA said the establishment of air quality monitoring stations by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in major cities of the province was crucial to address the issue.
It added that the relevant data should be made available to all government departments and people for adopting mitigation measures.
The authority also called for the conversion of all brick kilns to zigzag technology by the EPA to address the smog issue.
The report placed Upper Chitral, Kohistan, Upper Dir, Shangla, Mansehra, Swat and Lower Chitral in the category of high-risk districts regarding snowfall, landslides, avalanches, and extreme cold.
It declared Lower Kohistan, Torghar, Kolai-Palas, Charsadda, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, North and South Waziristan high-risk districts due to their vulnerability to the winter weather hazards, while 10 other districts have the medium risk and nine low risk for winter hazards.
The figures of damages caused by the winter hazards during the last three years showed that 115 people were killed in the weather-related incidents and 199 suffered injuries. Also, 960 houses were completely and partially damaged in such incidents.
The report said for timely and effective response at all levels, early warning was the key component for preparedness, which helped mitigates the damages and loss of lives and property from a disaster.
“In case of emergency, the Provincial Emergency Operations Centre at the PDMA will issue early warning,” it said.
According to the report, there is a close liaison between the PEOC and district emergency operation centre. Also, early warning is disseminated both horizontally and vertically to the relevant departments for coordinated response in case of any disaster.
The PDMA said it had placed sufficient funds at the disposal of all deputy commissioners all over the province and that officials had been mandated to utilise those funds to rectify any deficiency in preparedness measures for contingency planning and provide immediate relief to affected population.
When contacted, PDMA director-general Sharif Hussain said the winter contingency plan was developed in consultations with district administrations, provincial departments and humanitarian partners.
He said through contingency planning, the authority makes efforts to minimise the losses likely to be caused by the winter hazards and consequent disasters.
“We [PDMA] have initiated the process of introducing proactive preparedness regime under guidelines established by National Disaster Management Authority for disaster risk reduction and streamlining response at provincial and district levels in coordination with all stakeholders,” he told Dawn.
He said based on vulnerabilities and associated risks, the districts had been categorised in to very high, high, medium and low categories.
