0,Maryam lends support to protesting teachers against placement of schools under mayor,Thousands of teachers again hold protest after the government failed to change the local government ordinance as promised.,"ISLAMABAD: Protesting teachers on Thursday got support of PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz who criticised the government for placing Islamabad’s educational institutions under the local government.
Thousands of teachers held a rally from National Press Club to Parliament House where they staged a protest demonstration, demanding the government delete clause 166 of Local Government Act 2021.
Under the clause, the mayor will be the reporting officer of director-general of the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE).
As the teachers took to the streets, the PML-N leader tweeted that placing teachers under the local government was the worst example of the incompetence of the PTI government. She said her party was standing shoulder to shoulder with the teachers, adding the PML-N demands deletion of the disputed clause of the ordinance.
She said a person who had ruined the status of people should refrain from destroying future of the country. “He [PM] should be ready to go home,” she tweeted.

 



 
PPP leader Nafisa Shah, JI leader Mian Aslam and PPP’s Sibtul Haider Bukhari visited the protest site and expressed solidarity with the teachers. They assured them of their parties’ full support.
Earlier, thousands of teachers holding placards gathered outside the press club where they chanted slogans. While moving towards the Parliament House, the protesters faced resistance from police but removed all the hurdles and managed to reach outside the parliament building.
Action Committee of Teachers Chairman Fazal-i-Mola said after boycotting classes for a week the teachers had joined their duties on the assurance of the government that the ordinance would be amended. However, he said, no step was taken in this regard that forced the teachers to take to streets again.
He said if the educational institutions were devolved to the local government, the concept of free education and textbooks would end, as the local government could not afford such facilities.
Federal Government School Teachers Association President Malik Ameer Khan warned the government to delete section 166 otherwise thousands of parents and students would join the protest. He said soon the action committee would announce a new plan of protest.
The Federal Government College Teachers Association (FGCTA) also participated in the protest.
Addressing the protesters, FGCTA President Prof Rahima Rahman termed the insertion of section 166 an unwise decision of the government.
She demanded immediate removal of the section from the local government ordinance, adding it was a pity that the authorities had compelled respected teachers to take to the streets to protect their rights.
The protesting teachers said if the FDE, which regulates 423 schools and colleges, was placed under the administrative control of the mayor the education sector would face a big blow as running such as huge number of institutions was beyond the capacity of the local government.
They said these institutions needed a fund of Rs20 billion and the local government had no sources of income except taxes.
The teachers said they were employees of the federal government and if they were shifted to the local government they would be denied of many benefits which they currently availed.
On the other hand, the government said the service structure of teachers would not be disturbed and the mayor would be the reporting officer of the FDE chief.
Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) Ali Nawaz Awan recently told a press conference that the rights of the teaching and non-teaching staff would be protected and even then if there was any concern the government was ready to listen to them.

ISLAMABAD: Fascinating works depicting a fusion of the present with the past, while keeping a balance between modernity and tradition have been put on display at the Khaas Gallery.
The title of the exhibition is Commixture. The artist Ursula Kiesling, born in Austria, attempted to sort of reinterpret the miniature style of painting, creating an alternative technique; for instance, she used English on the borders instead of the former language.
The works highlight how people remain trapped in the same pattern as history repeats itself and how each generation thus forth faces the same problems.
Ms Kiesling staged several disparate dramas and story lines on the same platform, with the potential to intersect and contribute to a larger narrative; fictitious scenes, like news headlines, have been riddled with larger-than-life drama yet her images, like all art, is an imitation of reality.
The artist has tried to reveal to the viewer the idea of life in abundance: chaotic, rich, complex, and tumultuous. The world represented in her work seems to be a mixture of passions, hopes and motivations, where contrasting moods like joy and tragedy run side by side.
Ms Kiesling used a bright and radiant colour palette to show rather unpleasant scenes. To add her own spin to the work she used water colour while setting aside the traditional gouache on wasli method.
Some of the works reveal the splendour attached with matrimonial ceremonies in the country and how people continue to remain obsessed with them. By doing this, Ms Kiesling provided visitors a gateway into her own thoughts and the lens through which she views Pakistani society.
“This is a collection of stories that face dilemmas of our contemporary life in Pakistan. The way these stories are pictured reflects a playground for exploring the relationship between epic drama, as known from mythology and traditional visual storytelling from the era of the Mughal Empire.
“Coming as a European ex-pat to Pakistan I found myself first and foremost in a specific form of exchange within a specific framework and specific social conditions. Being aware of this exchange I cannot avoid that my artistic acting is multi-dimensional. I was lucky to find myself invited to several Pakistani weddings. The traditions of these weddings go way back and link to the customs and culture of the Indian subcontinent”, the artist said on the opening day.

On Tuesday, the AJK apex court had directed the government and other authorities concerned to complete the delimitation of LB wards within 45 days and conduct polls not later than August 2022.
At a press conference along with Raja Farooq Niaz and Farhat Ali Mir, members of the commission, Mr Sulehria asserted that his institution had geared up for holding the long due LB polls in a transparent manner in the wake of the apex court judgement that had put an end to the litigation on the issue had been running since 2017.
Giving details, he said all deputy commissioners (DC) had been designated as chairmen of the delimitation committees of their districts concerned, with the district election officers concerned, assistant commissioners and, in case of requirement, officials from any department as members.
According to him, the preliminary draft of delimitation by the committees would be published between Jan 6 and Jan 9 while one week had been allocated for filing of objections, if any, against the process before the authority concerned which would hear and dispose of the same between Jan 8 and Jan 20.
Final delimitations, he said, would be forwarded by the committees to the commission between Jan 21 and Jan 24.
The CEC maintained that in order to provide voting rights to the maximum number of eligible persons, Feb 20 had been fixed as ‘qualifying date’ for the purpose of update, correction and amendments in electoral rolls prepared for July 2021 general elections.
“We have directed all authorities concerned to immediately start the process for enrolment of fresh voters,” he said.
In response to a question, Mr Sulehria maintained that the election commission had to hold elections while a decision about the system of local bodies, such as direct mayoral election, etc., was the prerogative of the government.
He said the government was expected to introduce amendments to the Election Commission Act and Local Government Act in consultation with the commission in a few days.
He made it clear that like that of the general elections, votes in the LB polls would also be cast on the basis of voters’ permanent place of residence as entered in their computerised national identity cards.

8,President Alvi urges expat doctors to arrange online classes for local physicians,"The culture of unnecessary use of antibiotics should also be changed, says Alvi.","RAWALPINDI: President Dr Arif Alvi has urged Pakistani doctors abroad to arrange online lectures for local physicians so they would be trained further.
Addressing the 5th international scientific conference at Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU), the president said there was a need to further improve the ties between doctors and patients.
He stressed the need to promote precautionary measures among people to prevent diseases. The culture of unnecessary use of antibiotics should be changed. He asked the doctors to create awareness among mothers about breast feeding, adding the use of infant formula milk should be discouraged.
He said diseases like hepatitis, which spread due to irresponsible behaviour, could be controlled through precautionary measures. An estimated 9pc of Pakistan’s population is infected with hepatitis, he said.
He expressed the hope that Pakistan would succeed in eradicating polio. Despite problems like illiteracy, people followed SOPs and took precautionary measures against Covid-19 and in this regard ulema, doctors and others played their role, he said.
Dr Alvi said instead of treating every disease from the point of view of treatment, doctors should advise people to adopt precautionary measures, and lead the campaign against malnutrition and obesity.
“We should move towards long-term methods to tackle the problem of population growth,” he added.
Speaking on the occasion, RMU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Mohammad Umer said the conference was held in collaboration with the Association of Physicians of Pakistani Descent of North America, Association of Pakistani Physicians of North Europe, the RMU Alumni UK, Australia, New Zealand and UAE and the National Alumni of RMU.
