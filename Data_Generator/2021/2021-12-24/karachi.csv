0,Karachi's Green Line bus project set to start commercial operation tomorrow,The fare table is likely to range from Rs15 to Rs55 depending on the distance.,"KARACHI: After almost six years since its groundbreaking, the federal-funded Green Line Bus Rapid Transit Service (BRTS) is set to become operational with all 80 buses of its fleet ready to shuttle between Surjani Town and Numaish Chowrangi on Saturday. 
The mega project suffered many hiccups over the period and the delay caused it to incur almost double the cost. 
The fare table is likely to ranging from Rs15 to Rs55 depending on distance.  
The confirmation came from a key member of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) at the Centre who said that the test run of the bus service appeared effective, smooth and up to the mark. It’s set to start a fully-fledged commercial operation from Saturday, he said.  
The key point of the fare and any subsidy for the people of Karachi on the first-ever federal-funded transport service in decades was partially defined.  
“It’s going to be operational Insha Allah as announced,” Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar told Dawn in a brief response when he was referred to his two-week-old tweet disclosing the date for the commercial operation of the bus service as Dec 25.   

 



 
“The fare is actually a subject of the provincial government. So whatever is decided by the Sindh government in line with its defined rules, it would be followed. It may be between Rs15 and Rs55 depending on the journey by a passenger,” he said.  
In a tweet on Nov 28, the federal minister had announced the completion of the project’s first phase and expressed his confidence that it would be ready to operate from Dec 25.  
“I conducted a detailed review of the Karachi Green Line project yesterday,” Mr Umar said in the Nov 28 tweet. “This project will be ready for trial operation in the next 10 days. After that Prime Minister Imran Khan will visit Karachi for its launch. Insha Allah, the commercial operation will begin on December 25,” his tweet read.  
On Dec 10, the project was launched for its “soft and trial operation” by Prime Minister Imran Khan with a limited number of buses plying on the route to check and remove any flaw. The trial, an official said, met with success and no major problem was cited.
A few issues were noticed at different stations along the route while passengers boarded and got off the buses. These issues were addressed immediately, he added.  
“Some 60 passengers can travel on seats and as many can avail the service by standing in the in the two-portion buses with no rush-like situation,” he said.   
“The buses can move at 50 kilometres per hour but in most cases slower speed is recommended. There are more than 20 stations after every few kilometres, so maintaining a high speed is not practically possible. Between Surjani and Numaish points, the passengers would stay one hour or a little over on board, I think, and the time includes brief stopovers at all 21 stations,” he added.  
Envisaged and executed in Feb 2016 by then prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the project was originally scheduled to be completed within a year with an estimated cost of around Rs16.85 billion.
However, it took almost six years to complete and the cost has shot up to Rs35bn by now. The project was approved by the Executive Committee of National Economic Council (Ecnec) and executed by the Sindh Infrastructure Development Company Limited.

1,"Shootout between bandits, private guard claims small girl’s life in Karachi",The case was registered against unknown suspects at the Shah Latif Town police station.,"KARACHI: A late-night shootout between suspected bandits and a security guard of a minimart in Shah Latif Town claimed the life of a four-year-old girl, who was riding a motorbike driven by her father, police and witnesses said on Thursday.  
They said six armed men riding three motorbikes pulled up at the mart and three of them made their way into it. Another one disarmed the security guard and held him hostage at gunpoint while the remaining two stayed outside with their motorbikes.  
“When the bandits were coming out after looting the cash and mobile phones from the staff and customers in the mart, its manager started shouting making two of the bandits to open fire. In the meantime, the security guard managed to set himself free and get back his gun. He returned the fire wounding one of the bandits. All the six bandits, who had pistols, kept firing which forced the security guard to stop shooting,” a police official said.  
He added that during the shootout, a motorbike was caught in crossfire and one bullet hit the girl, later identified as Armeen, riding with her father. She received the bullet in her head.  
After the bandits drove away, the area people and wounded girl’s family members rushed her to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where she underwent a surgery but could not survive.  
The case was registered against unknown suspects. Shah Latif Town SHO Inspector Mumtaz Marwat argued that the security guard used a shotgun and the bandits had pistols.
“The girl seems to have sustained a pistol bullet wound,” he added citing the wound on her head. However, he said, a final medical report was awaited.

2,Zardari mulls anti-govt drive in Punjab,HYDERABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has said that he is going to Lahore to focus on ...,"HYDERABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari has said that he is going to Lahore to focus on Punjab and the rest of Pakistan because if he doesn’t stop his opponents there, they will keep “taking turns”.
He delivered a brief speech before party workers at the residence of his trusted friend Ghulam Qadir Marri in Tando Allahyar on Thursday where he had an overnight stay. Later, Mr Zardari left for Nawabshah to attend the funeral of his cousin and friend Raees Aftab Ahmed Zardari.
“I am going to visit entire Pakistan and I am going to sit in Lahore and pitch in tents there [Lahore],” the PPP leader said in his two-minute speech. “We will face them there,” he said without mentioning whether he meant the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf or the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. 
“Until we face them there [in Punjab] or stop them, they will be colluding with each other and taking turns one after the other [to assume power] but (for us) both are same,” he said.
He said: “People’s (awami) battle will be fought against them and finally masses will emerge victorious.”
Mr Zardari said that Benazir Bhutto had taught her children to always serve masses and the poor. Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Aseefa Bhutto would serve people as their future leaders, he said.
Talking to journalists, the PPP co-chairman said that time had come to launch a massive struggle against the federal government.
He said that Benazir Bhutto had a vision to serve the poor people of the country and today the PPP leadership was also making efforts to redress masses’ grievances. 
He said that his party was implementing the vision of Benazir Bhutto and added that late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto also had always given priority to resolving peoples’ problems. 
He said that his party’s philosophy was service of people without any discrimination and ensuring development works, including construction of roads and healthcare and educational institutions.

3,Opposition plans joint drive against LG law,"PTI, MQM-P leaders visit PML-F office to discuss strategy","KARACHI: Three main opposition parties in Sindh on Thursday agreed to launch a joint movement against the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021. They set up a steering committee which would devise a strategy regarding a future line of action.
The consensus came at a meeting of senior provincial leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) who visited the local headquarters of the Pakistan Muslim League Functional (PML-F) and discussed a joint action plan.
“We have decided to set up a steering committee which would have representation of all three parties,” said Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh while talking to reporters after the meeting. 
“We are very clear that we cannot allow this bill to become a law to snatch rights of people. We believe that every democratic party, which believes in devolution of powers and a strong system for local bodies, would sooner or later join hands in the larger interest of the people of Sindh. Today’s meeting is a move in the same direction.”

PTI, MQM-P leaders visit PML-F office to discuss strategy

Javed Hanif of the MQM-P said that his party had approached every party in the province and other parts of the country to invite them to share their opinion and concerns on the law. Everyone despite having ideological and political difference agreed with Muttahida’s viewpoint, he added.
“The PPP government has set a new tradition,” he said. “It has conceded defeat even before elections and in a preemptive move it has encroached upon every single power of the local government under this ‘black law’. After this bill, the democratic system in Sindh has practically become ineffective. MQM-Pakistan rejects this law, which is aimed at corruption and usurpation of peoples’ rights. We stand with the joint opposition.”
Sardar Rahim of the PML-F agreed with the PTI and MQM-P leaders and said that due to serious concerns over the ‘black law’ and ongoing campaign against it, his party was coordinating with every political entity that believed in a strong local bodies system in the province.
“Not only political parties, we would soon approach the business community through the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry as well as the legal fraternity to move court against the new LG law,” he said, adding that the opposition would not accept this dictatorial law to be thrust upon the masses.

5,IVS degree exhibition showcases prodigious talent,KARACHI: It is heartwarming to see noteworthy young talent coming out of Pakistan in the field of art. One can claim...,"KARACHI: It is heartwarming to see noteworthy young talent coming out of Pakistan in the field of art. One can claim that in no other field of expression does the country have shown such promise in recent times. The latest example is the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture’s annual degree show which concludes on Friday (Dec 24) after a five-day run.
The exhibition has on display theses of no fewer than 135 young boys and girls. The graduating students belong to the following disciplines: fine art, architecture, communication design and interior design. Then, as per a handout issued by the institute, “The first batch of our fashion design students is also graduating. Apart from this, our media design students’ music videos, animated shorts, and short films can be viewed at the film studio.”
Now, 135 is a reasonably big number. So it would be apt to concentrate in a generic way on some of the artworks which may highlight the kind of ideas that the young artists have found engaging. Interestingly, at least in the fine art department, the creative lot has focused on issues such as hazards of rapid urbanisation and the gradual moving away of nature’s munificence from our lives. Neem and banyan trees, for example, make their appearance as a potent metaphor for both neglect and resilience. To boot, the young artists use apt techniques to put their message across, so much so that it is virtually impossible for the viewer to take their eyes off the exhibits without a fair amount of inspection (and appreciation).
The pandemic, ongoing one might add, features not only as something that has affected the lives of human beings but also parks. Now Karachi, these days, is seldom associated with gardens. But the aesthetic charm with which a young fine art student has touched upon the subject is worth marveling at.
Then there are topics such as the loss of dear ones and the female body, dealt with the kind of sensitivity and grace that they deserve. And all of that is complemented with lines, colours and shapes that define art in its purest form.

6,Fast upgrade of 100 high schools to higher secondary ordered,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday directed the provincial authorities concerned to expedite the process of...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday directed the provincial authorities concerned to expedite the process of upgrading 100 high schools to higher secondary schools. 
A single-judge bench headed by Justice Salahuddin Panhwar also directed the provincial chief secretary and deputy commissioner of Hyderabad to pursue the issue of a hostel of historical importance -- the Noor Muhammad High School in Hyderabad -- meant for education purposes and occupied by Rangers, and ensure compliance of its earlier order to get the same vacated and hand it over to the school’s management within three months. 
On the request of an additional secretary of school education, the bench again granted one month to notify the Sindh education policy oversight council to monitor the public-sector education to overcome the shortcomings pointed out by an SHC-mandated education committee, but also warned the officials of legal consequences if the compliance was not made as several directives had been issued earlier but remained neglected. 
When the bench took up the matter about the up-gradation of 100 secondary schools as approved by the schools department on the directives of the bench, the secretary of schools contended that the planning and development department had raised various objections in this regard. 
At this juncture, the secretary of planning & development contended that in the summary submitted by the schools department, the details of criterion and location of schools and colleges and certain recommendations contained in it were in conflict with policy and they sought NOC of the secretary of colleges.
The bench observed that it appeared to be causing some confusion between the meaning of higher secondary schools and colleges which should never be the case because it was now clear that there must be a BS programme of four years and higher secondary education meant education up to class XII. 
The bench stated that while discharging functions and duties, including but not limited to upgrade of high schools, the schools department would not require NOC of the colleges department, but must proceed further while fixing priorities in up-gradation of schools. 
“Accordingly, monitoring policy or any other decision by the school department or colleges department which comes in the way of approval/up-gradations of 100 schools, as pointed out, shall not come in the way and the school /education department shall resubmit summary within two days and thereafter planning and development department shall forward the same, after completing all the codal formalities, within ten days to the finance department and the secretary finance, government of Sindh shall ensure approval of up-gradation with SNEs within next 15 days”, the bench in its order said.

8,Consultations under way to finalise strategic plan of NCHR,KARACHI: The National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) in collaboration with European Union-funded...,"KARACHI: The National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) in collaboration with European Union-funded Huqooq-e-Pakistan (HeP) project organised a media consultation at a local hotel on Wednesday.
It was explained that following the launch of a country-wide consultative process for the commission’s four-year strategic plan, two consecutive sessions were held with civil society representatives and media, where participants shared a broad range of opinions to devise a pragmatic strategic plan for the NCHR. 
The commission plans to hold similar sessions in other provincial capitals to gather information and recommendations from all parts of the country.
In the opening note, NCHR chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha said the opinions and recommendations coming out from these consultations would be taken into account while preparing the commission’s strategic plan and for determining their next steps. 
“One of the main functions of the commission is to inform the government about the problems faced by the people and civil society in the reports. The commission and government together can then be like an ecosystem of human rights,” she said, adding that the commission had a judicial role to play.
“Looking at its records of issues resolution, the commission also works as an advisory. For instance, if there is a new law in the making, we can advise lawmakers on it. Our mandate is to get information from the grassroots level and take it to government,” she said.
Coming to the current consultation with the media, she said that the media is very important. “The media shapes opinion. It plays a crucial role in the protection and promotion of human rights. The media can be our support and we can be media’s support. The media needs to be strong because it has a paramount role of bringing people back on track. That is its moral and ethical responsibility. It informs, educates and sensitises the general public as well as policymakers, civil society and those implementing the laws and policies. Besides that, it connects people with the government and other stakeholders. So we want to talk to the media too to learn about its issues,” she said.

9,Court orders Hyderabad DC to use Anti-Encroachment Force against land-grabbers,‘A civil judge be appointed to inspect areas from where encroachments have been cleared’,"HYDERABAD: The Hyd­er­­abad circuit bench of the Sindh High Court on Thursday ordered Hyder­abad deputy commissioner to mobilise the Anti-Encroachment Force (AEF) and ask it to carry out patrolling throughout the city and take action against encroachers.
The division bench comprising Justices Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro and Adnanul Karim Memon passed the order while hearing identical petitions filed by Rabiur Rehman, Irtafaur Rehman and Shanur Rehman, residents of Qasimabad on the issue of encroachments 
Hyderabad deputy commissioner Fuad Ghaffar Soomro said that AEF, of which he was ex officio director general, was responsible for the removal of immovable encroachment from government land and routine encroachments were to be handled by Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (HMC). 
There was shortage of traffic police personnel in Hyderabad as well as machinery for the task of removal of encroachments. The HMC’s anti-encroachment cell needed to share their plan for the drive. As the AEF head, the DC could recover fine from encroachers as per law which did not cover vendors and pushcarts, he said.

‘A civil judge be appointed to inspect areas from where encroachments have been cleared’

The bench directed special secretary of Sindh local government department to move a summary to chief minister to seek special grant for procurement of machinery for the removal of encroachments from the city and get Octroi zila tax (OZT) share for HMC released.
It ordered that an officer from Cantonment Board Hyderabad (CBH) should appear before the court on next date of hearing on Jan 27 to explain encroachment related matters in CBH’s limits, and ordered sessions judge to depute a civil judge who would visit the areas from where encroachments had been removed as per the administration’s claim and submit a report.
The DC submitted to the bench progress report on anti-encroachment drive and said that soft encroachment had been removed by the administration and those who were affected by the action were now holding protests on a daily basis.
He said that in line with past order of the court, the local government department and Hyderabad Development Authority (HDA) shared reports about amenity plots, playgrounds and open spaces only two days back. 
He cited Islamabad Capital Territory’s law that said that encroachment drive was to be launched by municipal body, which in Hyderabad’s case was HMC, and said assistant commissioners used to have magisterial powers that were later withdrawn. “Submit your proposal [for executive magistracy powers for administration officers] to us and we will ask the government to do some legislation on it,” said Justice Kalhoro.
Advocate Imdad Unnar, who was appearing on behalf of Municipal Committee Qasimabad, disagreed with the DC’s contention on AEF and said that under section 19 of Anti-Encroachment Act 2010 encroachment’s removal on entire ’land’ was responsibility of AEF. 
He said that the DC as ex officio director general of AEF could not deviate from the law. 
Unnar drew attention of the court towards the fact that encroachments also existed in CBH limits but its management was not cooperating in this regard.
Justice Kalhoro asked the DC to write to the department concerned for seeking help on behalf of this court.
An official of finance department informed the court that his department did not release special funds to any council for removal of encroachments or for procurement of machinery for the purpose. However, the secretary concerned could move a summary to the chief minister to seek funds under special grant, he said. 
The bench directed special secretary of Sindh LG Zubair Pervez to submit a summary to the chief minister for special grant including funds for HMC’s OZT share.
The court directed Hyderabad sessions judge to appoint a civil judge for inspecting the areas from where encroachments had been removed as per DC’s claim and submit a report. 
The court ordered DC Hyderabad to mobilise AEF to patrol the city and take action against encroachers. An officer from CBH should appear in court on Jan 27, it said. 
The court said that relocation of poles from roads had been discussed in past hearing for which a proposal had been sent to Sindh government to be decided by finance department.

The  project also saw greater community-level acceptance and confidence in  community midwives as family planning service providers due to their  improved counselling skill and ability to tackle family planning issues.  
The study was conducted by the Population Council (PC) in  collaboration with provincial departments of health and population  welfare and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and its findings  were shared at a local hotel the other day. 
The objective of the  research was to examine and identify cost-effective ways of utilising  existing health resources to improve women’s rights-based access to  family planning services in Sindh, particularly in its rural areas. Presenting  key findings of the study, Iram Kamran the Population Council shared  that it recorded an increase in community-wide family planning service  uptake due to improved outreach. 
“Provision of family planning  service by trained community midwives also improved due to expanded  choice of methods and capacity for delivering postpartum family planning  counselling. 
Regular contraceptive supplies played a major role in enhancing utilisation of family planning services,” she said. 
In her speech, Rehan Iqbal Baloch,  provincial secretary of population welfare department, said the  government was trying to increase coordination mechanisms between the  population welfare and health departments at district level to improve  access to family planning services. 
During a  plenary discussion, Dr Talib Lashari, technical adviser at the  population welfare department, briefed the audience about the steps  taken to improve the family planning programme. 
In her remarks, Bayramgul Garabayeva,  provincial representative of  UNFPA, reaffirmed the role of the  organisation to work with the Pakistan government on evidence-based  policy making to strengthen population welfare and health programmes in  the country.

The shocked student, who was in her final year of the degree, told media persons that a student of third year of the same department, who had been harassing her for about a week, forcibly got onto the bus along with his friends, who were armed with weapons, while the bus was going to the university from Mehrabpur and tried to kidnap her at gunpoint near Ranipur.
She said that when some students put up resistance they injured them with butts of the weapons and escaped hurling threats and resorting to aerial firing.
“Police have filed a non-cognizable offence report on a complaint lodged by the victim and mobilised teams to arrest the alleged kidnappers,” said a police report.
The university’s vice-chancellor Prof Dr Khalil Ahmed Ubepoto expressed anger over the incident and directed the varsity’s student affairs committee to take strict disciplinary action against the alleged student according to the university’s code of conduct, said a press release. 
He said that such incidents and indiscipline by students would never be tolerated. The administration of Khairpur district would also be informed so that further action could be taken against such elements under the law, he said.
