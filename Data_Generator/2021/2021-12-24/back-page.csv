0,Pakistan welcomes UNSC resolution easing aid flow to Afghanistan,"FO says resolution adopted at a critical time, reflects world community's “sense of urgency” to help Afghan people.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday welcomed the UN Security Council resolution that eased the flow of aid to Afghanistan and expressed the hope that the world would urgently fulfil the needs of struggling Afghans.
“Pakistan welcomes the adoption, by consensus, of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2615, that has reaffirmed that provision of humanitarian and other assistance to the people of Afghanistan is not a violation of the Security Council’s Sanctions regime,” a statement issued by the Foreign Office said.
The Security Council on Wednesday adopted a US-proposed resolution allowing humanitarian aid to be delivered to Afghanistan to avert an economic collapse.
The resolution read: “Payment of funds, other financial assets or economic resources and the provision of goods and services necessary to ensure the timely delivery of such assistance or to support such activities are permitted.”
It noted that such assistance would not violate the sanctions imposed on Taliban and their affiliates.
There has been widespread recognition of the aggravating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan, but donors have struggled to find ways to deliver aid to the people in the war-ravaged country.
The FO said the resolution had been adopted at a critical time, and the move reflected the international community’s “sense of urgency” to help the Afghan people.
It further noted that the resolution was “a step in the right direction” for helping the Afghans faced with a dire situation.
It recalled that this sentiment was reflected in the resolution adopted unanimously by the 17th extraordinary session of the OIC’s meeting of Council of Foreign Ministers hosted by Pakistan last week.
The OIC meeting had called for the swift roll-out of all possible humanitarian, recovery, reconstruction, development, technical and material assistance to Afghanistan.
“As called for by the OIC, pathways should now be found towards revitalising of the Afghan economy and unfreezing of the assets that rightfully belong to the Afghan people,” it added.
Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his speech at the OIC CFM, had also stated that sanctions should not prevent the international community from providing humanitarian and other essential assistance to the people of Afghanistan.
“Pakistan hopes that the international community, especially the donor countries, UN agencies, humanitarian organisations, international financial institutions and other emergency relief providers, will act swiftly and with determination, to provide all possible assistance to the people of Afghanistan,” the FO said.

1,IMF to take up sixth review of its programme on Jan 12,Govt ready to get Finance (Supplementary) Bill passed by National Assembly.,"ISLAMABAD: The government says its sixth review of the $6 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Pakistan will be taken up by the executive board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Jan 12, paving the way for disbursement of about $1bn tranche.
Muzammil Aslam, spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance, said in a tweet on Thursday: “I am pleased to confirm 6th review will be presented to IMF Board on 12th January, 2022”.

 



 
Another official said the government was ready to get the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021 passed by the National Assembly to ensure reasonable time before the IMF board meeting.
The IMF directors traditionally require two weeks to review the memorandum of economic and fiscal policy measures.

Govt ready to get Finance (Supplementary) Bill passed by NA

Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin had committed to the IMF that Pakistan would complete all five “prior actions” before requesting a meeting of the board of directors to approve revival of the $6bn EFF suspended in April this year.
Under those prior actions, the government, through the supplementary finance bill, will effect a net fiscal adjustment of almost Rs550bn during the remaining part of the current fiscal through a 22 per cent cut in development funds, about Rs360bn worth of withdrawal of tax exemptions with a revised tax target of Rs6.1 trillion and increase in petroleum levy on major petroleum products by Rs4 per litre per month.
Making an upfront announcement about “five prior actions” to secure approval of the IMF board for disbursement of $1.06bn and revival of the IMF programme in January, Mr Tarin had recently said the government would also ensure “approval” by parliament to grant autonomy on matters of monetary policy, exchange rate and recruitments to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), which would remain answerable to parliament as it was now.
These prior actions include SBP (Amendment) Bill, withdrawal of tax exemptions and increase in energy tariff. The action pertaining to tariff adjustment has already been taken while bills to end tax exemptions and give autonomy to the SBP have been finalised.
Under the supplementary finance bill, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is seeking amendments to three key tax laws relating to customs, sales tax and income tax, besides the services tax law for the federal capital.
The underlying purpose of the reform exercise, as pushed through by the international lenders, is to “rebuild the tax system on ideal principles of taxation and without any distortions” as far-reaching structural and administrative reforms have already been initiated by the ‘present government’ to “achieve economic and financial stability through inclusive reforms and sustainable economic growth”.
In terms of revenue generation, withdrawal of exemptions and removal of different rates under the sales tax law appear to be the biggest sources of additional tax. There is a long list running into hundreds of items that would attract higher sales tax rates and application of fresh tax.
“Under the Sales Tax Act 1990, zero-rating under the Fifth Schedule is proposed to be streamlined and certain entries are to be withdrawn,” documents suggest. “The exemption regime under the Sixth Schedule is proposed to be curtailed including pharmaceutical sector and restricted to import and local supply of essential commodities only.”

2,Army chief briefed about preparedness during visit to LoC bases,COAS appreciates the combat readiness of troops and their high morale.,"ISLAMABAD: Army Chief Gen Qamar Bajwa was briefed about operational preparedness on the Line of Control during a visit to the forward bases on Thursday.
“General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Chief of Army Staff (COAS), visited forward areas along Line of Control (LOC) today. The COAS was briefed on ground situation along the LOC and operational preparedness of the formation,” the ISPR said in a statement.
The army chief interacted with troops deployed along the LoC in Kot Kotera Sector, the ISPR statement further said.
A ceasefire on the LoC has held since Pakistan and India revived it in February after backchannel talks. The resumption of ceasefire was widely welcomed as many hoped that it would eventually pave the way for normalisation of ties.
The hopes were reinforced when weeks later Gen Bajwa, while speaking at a seminar in Islamabad, said that it was time for India and Pakistan to bury the past and move forward.
However, mistrust and hostility have continued to mar the relationship. There has been no let-up in the Indian government’s vile rhetoric against Pakistan.
Gen Bajwa, during his visit to LoC, appreciated the combat readiness of the troops and their high state of morale.
“Continuous vigil and rea­diness to counter all threats and contingencies is vital for ensuring security along the LoC,” he emphasised.
