0,AstraZeneca says booster jab effective against Omicron,"Reveals in other findings that its moniclonal antibody treatment, Evusheld, “retains neutralisation activity” against Omicron.","LONDON: British pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca said on Thursday that a third, or “booster”, dose of its Covid-19 vaccine Vaxzevria “significantly” lifted antibody levels against the Omicron strain in a laboratory study.
AstraZeneca also revealed in other findings that its preventative moniclonal antibody treatment, Evusheld, “retains neutralisation activity” against Omicron.
The threat of the highly transmissible Omicron variant looms large over the festive holidays, forcing many governments to roll out new curbs and urge citizens to get vaccinated. However, separate UK research on Thursday suggested that Omicron infections are less likely to result in hospitalisation compared to the Delta variant.
“Vaxzevria significantly boosted levels of antibodies against the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.529) following a third dose booster,” AstraZeneca said in a statement.
“The third dose booster vaccination neutralised the Omicron variant to levels that were broadly similar to those observed... after the second dose against the Delta variant.” Levels of neutralising antibodies were also higher with the booster jab than with individuals who had previously been infected and recovered naturally.
The study was conducted by investigators from the University of Oxford, which is the academic institution which helped AstraZeneca develop the vaccine last year.
Researchers analysed blood samples taken from individuals infected with Covid-19; those vaccinated with two doses plus a booster; and those who had reported previous infection. “It is very encouraging to see that current vaccines have the potential to protect against Omicron following a third dose booster,” said University of Oxford professor John Bell, one of the study investigators.

1,"US, Pakistan work together to avert economic collapse in Afghanistan",Pakistan’s US ambassador thanks US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for sending his envoy to the OIC FM meeting in Islamabad.,"WASHINGTON: Pakistan on Thursday said continued and close US engagement would ensure that needed assistance reaches the people of Afghanistan promptly.
Pakistan’s US ambassador, Asad Majeed Khan, made this statement while thanking US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for sending his envoy to an OIC foreign ministers meeting in Islamabad last week.
“Thank you for your leadership and US participation in the OIC Conference as an observer,” he said in a tweet. “Continued and close US engagement would remain critical in ensuring that direly needed assistance reaches the people of Afghanistan promptly,” he wrote.

 



 
Secretary Blinken, who sent his Special Envoy Thomas West to the conference, said in a tweet on Wednesday that the OIC extraordinary session on Afghanistan was “a prime example of our collective determination and action to help those most in-need”.
“We thank Pakistan for hosting this vital meeting & inviting the global community to continue cooperating to support the Afghan people,” he added. The two messages indicate that Pakistan and the US had been quietly reviewing various options for keeping the Afghan economy afloat. Since Aug 15, when the Taliban took over Kabul, Pakistan has been urging the international community not to bring down the Afghan economy as it would multiply the miseries of the Afghan citizens already suffering the consequences of almost half a century of wars and strife.
The US, which provided $474 million humanitarian assistance to Afghan­istan this year, was not against helping the Afghan people but did not want the Taliban to benefit from this assistance.
While welcoming the US assistance, Pakistan argued that humanitarian assistance alone would not work in a country which had no cash, no banking system and no means of receiving or distributing the assistance it received. The Taliban government could not even distribute the remittances received from Afghans living abroad.
Last week, 39 US lawmakers sent a letter to their secretaries of state and treasury, asking them to help rebuild Afghanistan’s failing economy and to unfreeze the country’s assets. Various UN agencies also sent similar messages.
The US reacted to the Taliban takeover by seizing $9.5 billion of Afghan assets in its control. The US and other Western powers also tightened the sanctions imposed by the United Nations, bringing Afghanistan to an economic collapse.
On Monday, a spokesperson for the State Department indicated that the Biden administration was willing to go beyond humanitarian assistance to prevent an economic disaster.

2,"Bustling bars, surging business: Dubai sees a post-vax boom","DUBAI: Nations around the world are lurching into lockdown, steeling themselves for a brutal surge as the omicron...","DUBAI: Nations around the world are lurching into lockdown, steeling themselves for a brutal surge as the omicron variant spreads like wildfire.
But in Dubai, Donna Sese is bracing for a very different surge: countless restaurant bookings and metre-long drink bills.
“We’re back and busy like the way things used to be,” said Sese, manager of the Yalumba restaurant at the five-star Le Meridien hotel, where devotees of Dubai’s Friday brunch pay $250 for lavish spreads with free-flowing Clicquot Champagne.
The globalised city-state appears to be in the midst of a boom season, spurred on by one of the world’s highest vaccination rates and government steps to lure businesses and de-escalate tensions with regional rivals.
Maskless debauchery has returned to dance floors. Brunch-goers are drinking with abandon. Home-buyers are flooding the market. Tourists are snapping up hotel suites. Expat millionaires are moving to the emirate. Coronavirus infections, although now making a comeback, remain below past peaks. The Dubai government did not respond to request for comment.
It’s dj vu for those recalling the rush of December last year in Dubai, when the city courted tourists and influencers fleeing coronavirus lockdowns and wintry weather elsewhere. The open-door policy let revellers sate their pent-up desire to go out on New Year’s Eve but infections soon rocketed to unseen heights, and hospitals filled up with Covid-19 patients.
A year later, mass vaccination has left Dubai feeling like its off the hook. There have been vanishingly few virus hospitalisations and deaths even as the global spread of omicron threatens a new surge. Daily infections surpassed 1,000 on Thursday after lows of under 100 for weeks.
While many Western countries have seen inoculation rates plateau, the UAE reports 99pc of all of those eligible for vaccines anyone over 12 has received at least one dose. Some have received five.
In the global vaccine scramble, the UAE relied initially on a shot made by Sinopharm, a state-backed Chinese company. Even as the nation’s vaccination rate soared, infections rose as did concerns over Sinopharm’s insufficient antibody response.
Now, Sinopharm is no longer an option in Dubai. Those who received both doses, including the emirate’s legions of low-paid foreign laborers, also have opted for double vaccination with Pfizer-BioNTech. The government offers Pfizer boosters to all adults.
Months of trepidation have given way to unburdened excitement. Encouraged by widespread inoculation and record-low mortgage rates, more properties were sold in Dubai in November than in any other month in the last eight years, according to website Property Finder.
Sales prices have surged past pre-pandemic levels. Until June, prices were climbing 2.5pc month on month, with wild appreciations in the luxury segment.
Market analysts have attributed the hot streak to a pause in villa construction and influx of Western European, Chinese and Indian financiers drawn to glittery Dubai’s open offices, high vaccination and low tax rates.
A giant cryptocurrency conference in October drew dozens of young millionaires who paid cash upfront for beach villas, real estate agents said.
You can go to restaurants. There’s no debate about remote working. This is not the case in Europe where it’s still locking down, said Christophe De Rassenfosse, the chief product officer of Property Finder, about why he moved his family from Brussels to Dubai in October. You don’t necessarily have a huge percentage of elderly people which occupies the hospitals.
The government has promoted plans to make the sheikhdom more attractive to foreign investors and visitors, with new 10-year visas, retirement and freelance options and reforms to the country’s Islamic legal code.

3,Hong Kong university dismantles Tiananmen statue,Operation condemned by Hong Kong democracy activists; labelled “despicable act” by former student leader who survived Tiananmen.,"

HONG KONG: Hong Kong’s oldest university removed a statue commemorating the 1989 crackdown on Tiananmen Square democracy protesters on Thursday, the latest step in China’s campaign to silence dissent in its southern city.
The night-time operation was condemned by Hong Kong democracy activists and labelled a “despicable act” by one former student leader who survived Tiananmen.
The eight-metre (26-feet) high “Pillar of Shame” by Jens Galschiot has sat on the University of Hong Kong’s (HKU) campus since 1997, the year the former British colony was handed back to China.
The sculpture features 50 anguished faces and tortured bodies piled on one another and commemorates democracy protesters killed by Chinese troops around Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Its presence was a vivid illustration of Hong Kong’s freedoms compared to the Chinese mainland where the events at Tiananmen are heavily censored.
But Beijing is currently remoulding the city in its own authoritarian image after democracy protests two years ago and commemorating Tiananmen has become effectively illegal.
In October, HKU officials ordered the removal of the sculpture citing new but unspecified legal risks.
They made good on that promise in the early hours of Thursday morning.
University staff used floor-to-ceiling sheets and barriers to shield the statue as sounds of drilling and metal clanging could be heard throughout the night.
Security guards tried to stop media filming but reporters were still able to capture images of the statue being cut into chunks, wrapped in plastic and carted away.
HKU confirmed the statue had been placed in storage after the operation was completed.

4,US Navy claims seizing Iranian arms bound for Yemen,Western nations and UN experts have repeatedly accused Iran of smuggling illicit weapons and technology into Yemen.,"

DUBAI: The US Navy said it seized a large cache of assault rifles and ammunition being smuggled by a fishing ship from Iran likely bound for war-ravaged Yemen.
US Navy patrol ships discovered the weapons aboard what the Navy described as a stateless fishing vessel in an operation that began on Monday in the northern reaches of the Arabian Sea off Oman and Pakistan. Sailors boarded the vessel and found 1,400 Kalashnikov-style rifles and 226,600 rounds of ammunition, as well as five Yemeni crew members.
It’s just the latest interdiction amid the grinding war in Yemen that pits Iran-backed Houthi rebels against a Saudi-led military coalition. Western nations and UN experts repeatedly have accused Iran of smuggling illicit weapons and technology into Yemen over the years, fueling the civil war and enabling the Houthis to fire missiles and drones into Saudi Arabia.
Iran denies arming the Houthis despite evidence to the contrary.
In an unusually pointed move, the statement late on Wednesday from the US Navy’s Bahrain-based 5th Fleet blamed Iran for sending the weapons, alleging the boat was sailing along a route used to traffic weapons unlawfully to the Houthis in Yemen.
The direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer of weapons to the Houthis violates UN Security Council resolutions and US sanctions, the statement added.
Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the interception.
US Navy patrol ships transferred the confiscated weapons to the guided-missile destroyer USS OKane before sinking the fishing vessel because of the hazard it posed to commercial shipping. It said the Yemeni crew would be repatriated.
American seizures of arms bound for Yemen’s war, typically Kalashnikov rifles, machine guns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, began in 2016 and have continued intermittently. Yemen is awash with small arms that have been smuggled into poorly controlled ports over years of conflict.
The Navy’s 5th fleet said it has confiscated some 8,700 illicit weapons so far this year across the 2.5 million-square-mile area it patrols, including the strategically important Red Sea and the Gulf.
Yemen’s war erupted in 2014, when the Houthis seized the capital of Sanaa and much of the country’s north. Saudi Arabia, along with the United Arab Emirates and other countries, launched a bombing campaign months later to restore the internationally recognised government and oust the rebels.

5,Suicide bomber killed at Kabul passport office gate,"KABUL: A suicide bomber was killed at the gate of a passport office in the Afghan capital Kabul on Thursday, a...","KABUL: A suicide bomber was killed at the gate of a passport office in the Afghan capital Kabul on Thursday, a government spokesman said, and several people were injured in the blast, according to unconfirmed reports.
A spokesman for Afghanistan’s interior ministry said the attacker was shot and killed while trying to enter the passport office premises.
One member of the Taliban who was a witness said multiple people were injured, and the building and streets around the area were locked down by Taliban security forces.
Large crowds of Afghans have been thronging outside the passport office in a bid to get travel documents in recent days after the service was restarted after weeks of suspension.
Officials said that Thursdays are reserved as a special day for Taliban officials to visit the passport office to make travel documents.
“He was identified and killed at a checkpoint at the entrance,” Mobin Khan, spokesman for Kabul police, said.
There have been several attacks against Taliban fighters since their return to power in August — most claimed by the local chapter of the militant Islamic State group.
Around 200 Taliban fighters had gathered at the passport office from dawn after authorities announced that Thursdays would be set aside exclusively for them to apply for passports.
It was unclear why the fighters wanted passports — or where they planned to travel to — as security operatives barred reporters from interviewing them.
Civilians who arrived to process their applications were held back or sent home by Taliban security, who also tore up documents of some as they pressed to enter.
“Issuing passports to the Taliban members was cancelled due to overcrowding,” said Qari Shafiullah Tassal, a spokesman for the office.
Many people were also falsely claiming they had Taliban links, he said.
Taliban fighters were also given the opportunity to apply for passports in the southern city of Kandahar, according to a reporter there.
Taliban authorities stopped issuing passports after they returned to power on August 15, citing staff issues, faulty equipment and a lack of supplies.

6,Turkish lira rebounds from historic low after govt assurance,"Despite the rebound, risk measures are near all-time highs as questions remain over the state’s anti-dollarisation plan.","ISTANBUL: Turkey’s lira rallied further on Thursday and was on track for its best week in two decades, boosted by a government plan to protect some deposits and the added support of state banks aggressively selling dollars.
The lira rallied as much as 10pc to 10.25 versus the dollar, its strongest level in a month, before paring most of those gains to trade at 11.395 at close of business.
The currency has whipsawed back from a historic low of 18.4 on Monday when it was down some 60pc on the year, capping a week of record volatility and intraday swings.
Despite the rebound, risk measures are near all-time highs as questions remain over the state’s anti-dollarisation plan, which could further stoke inflation, add to public debt and eat into foreign reserves if the lira begins sliding again.
In an echo of past interventions, four sources said that Turkey’s state banks heavily sold dollars this week after President Tayyip Erdogan announced the government would guarantee some deposits against depreciation losses. One source said the interventions on Monday and Tuesday totalled $3 billion. The selling coincided with a drop in the central bank’s foreign reserves, which a second source said amounted to $6 billion on those two days alone.
The three big state banks — Ziraat Bank, Vakif Bank and Halk Bank — did not immediately comment on possible interventions. The central bank was not immediately available to comment.
The central bank’s balance sheet suggests that $5.5 billion of the fall in net reserves on Monday and Tuesday is due to foreign currency sales, said Haluk Burumcekci, head of Istanbul-based Burumcekci Consulting.
Reflecting market jitters, the cost of insuring against a sovereign default using CDS broke above 600 basis points earlier this week, before dipping back to 593, still near all-time highs, according to IHS Markit.
