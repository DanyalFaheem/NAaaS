0,Report sought on implementation of anti-rape law,"Senate standing committee summons home secretaries, police chiefs.","ISLAMABAD: The Senate’s standing committee on law and justice has asked the home secretaries and the police chiefs of the four provinces and Islamabad to appear before it with data about implementation of the new anti-rape law.
Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, who presided over the committee’s meeting on Thursday, lauded the government’s efforts for promulgating the anti-rape law, but said the main objections in the past had been about its implementation.
The Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021, passed recently by parliament, seeks to establish special courts and the use of modern devices during investigation and trial in rape cases.
The meeting was attended, among others, by Senators Shibli Faraz, Mohammad Azam Khan Swati, Azam Nazeer Tarar, Mian Raza Rabbani, Kamran Murtaza, Manzoor Ahmed Kakar and Mushtaq Ahmed.

Senate standing committee summons home secretaries, police chiefs

Ali Zafar, the chair, stated that after adoption of the law, incidents of rape in all the provincial metropolises and the federal capital had been reported in the press. He cited a news report according to which some people aided the rape of a 14-years-old girl.
He said it was unfortunate that laws adopted by the legislature for benefit of the majority were seldom implemented.
Ali Zafar noted that information received by him suggested the IGs and home departments were not yet aware about different provisions of anti-rape laws. Hence provisions relating to investigation and medical examination were not being followed.
He directed the law ministry to provide details of the steps taken to implement the anti-rape law.
Separation of powers
Barrister Zafar informed the committee that the Supreme Court had recently delivered some judgements about the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary as well as the scope and parameters of parliament.
He stated that parliament must safeguard its powers and jurisdiction under the Constitution and ordered that details of these cases be placed before the committee on the next date of hearing.
The committee, which examined a raft of constitutional amendments moved by former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani and others, observed that the legislature had the right to pass laws and since the separation of powers between different organs of the state was a constitutional matter, the issue demanded a thorough examination.
The committee dwelt at length on different constitutional amendments regarding the Senate’s role in coordinating with the provinces and bringing forth their grievances. The president’s powers relating to promulgation of ordinances also came up for debate.
But the discussion on these matters remained inconclusive as comments from various departments of the government were awaited.
The committee summoned a record of resolutions passed by the Senate regarding the proposed amendments.

1,IHC stops construction of wall around Defence Complex,Admits for regular hearing petition filed against alleged encroachment upon state land.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has stopped construction of a wall around the Defence Complex, also known as the New General Headquarters, and ordered that action be taken against any illegal activity or construction undertaken on state land.
While hearing a petition filed by an affected villager on Thursday, IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah also ordered the CDA to make sure that the Defence Complex is constructed in accordance with the approved plan.
The petitioner — a resident of Bairi Meera village, which falls within the notified area of the Margalla Hills National Park — has challenged the alleged illegal encroachment of the Quarter Master General (QMG) upon land around the Defence Complex in Sector E-10.
The petition asserts that a specified area was allotted by the CDA under the Capital Deve­lopment Authority Ordinance, 1960 for establishing the Defence Complex in Sector E-10.

Admits for regular hearing petition filed against alleged encroachment upon state land

The petitioner has attached photographs to the petition in an effort to show that QMG illegally encroached upon an area of the national park by undertaking construction of a wall.
The wall is situated outside the area allotted for establishing the complex, according to the petitioner.
The high court noted that in identical petitions the Supreme Court — vide orders dated Oct 25, 2013 and March 16, March 18 and March 19, 2015 — explicitly held that no illegal activity or construction could be allowed within the notified areas of the national park.
Moreover, IHC judgement titled ‘Shahzada Sikandar Ul Mulk and four others v. Capital Development Authority’ was upheld by the Supreme Court wherein it was held that no activity or construction could be allowed in violation of the CDA Ordinance of 1960, the Islamabad Capital Territory (Zoning) Regulations, 1992, read with MLR 82, Islamabad Building Regulations, 1963, Islamabad Residential Sectors Zoning (Building Control) Regulation, 2005, the Islamabad Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Ordinance, 1979 and the Islamabad (Preservation of Landscape) Ordinance, 1966.
“It, prima facie, appears to the court that the Ministry of Defence through QMG has violated the aforementioned laws,” the court observed, adding that “in such an eventuality, the CDA and the federal government would be held liable for failing to fulfil their statutory and constitutional obligations”.
Justice Minallah warned that “such consequences, inter alia, entail criminal prosecution under Section 46 of the Ordinance of 1960 and disciplinary proceedings against officials found responsible for taking law into their own hands”.
The IHC chief justice noted that the questions raised in the petition were of paramount public importance and admitted it for regular hearing. He issued notices to the QMG, defence ministry and CDA.
The court also issued a directive for the secretary of the Ministry of Defence and the Quarter Master General of Pakistan Army to refrain “from undertaking any activity or purported construction outside the specified area allotted by the Authority for establishing the ‘Defence Complex’ in Sector E-10”.
“The Secretary, Ministry of Interior and Chairmen of Capital Development Authority and the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board shall forthwith jointly inspect the area and ensure that no activity whatsoever is undertaken or carried out by QMG outside the allotted land, particularly within the notified area of the Margalla Hills National Park,” said the court order.
Justice Minallah also directed the CDA chairman “to ensure that no construction or activity is allowed… in violation of the aforementioned laws/regulations and approved layout plan, etc”.
The secretary of the interior ministry and the CDA chairman were directed to submit their affidavits, confirming that no activity or construction has been or is being carried out in violation of the approvals granted under the aforementioned enforced laws/regulations.
Furthermore, the court directed that proceedings and actions be taken against any illegal activity or construction undertaken by the QMG.
The IHC chief justice added that “in case the aforementioned laws/regulations have been violated, then the secretaries of the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Interior and the chairman of the Capital Development Authority are directed to appear before the Court to explain why proceedings may not be… initiated against officials responsible for taking the law into their own hands or facilitating illegalities/encroachments in the protected notified area of Margalla Hills National Park”.
Further hearing in the case was adjourned till Dec 28.

2,"Heads of Lahore, Sukkur regions among five NAB DGs transferred",Seasoned bureaucrat has been posted as director general for Lahore region,"ISLAMABAD: In a major reshuffle in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), five of its directors general were transferred on Thursday, including the watchdog’s regional heads posted in Lahore and Sukkur who were called back to the headquarters.
Arguably the most significant development is the transfer of the bureau’s director general for Lahore, Shahzad Saleem, who remained in the headlines in recent years for proactively pursuing alleged corruption cases of former prime minister and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif, his brother and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and their family members.
Under the reshuffle, Mr Saleem has been posted as head of the bureau’s Awareness & Prevention (A&P) Division based at its headquarters.
Mirza Muhammad Irfan Baig, who was similarly quite active in investigating cases of alleged corruption of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leaders, including former leader of the opposition in the National Assembly Syed Khursheed Shah, has been transferred from the post of director general for Sukkur and posted as director general of Training & Research (T&R) Division.

Seasoned bureaucrat has been posted as director general for Lahore region

A newcomer in the NAB hierarchy but a seasoned bureaucrat — Jamil Ahmed, who was waiting for posting at the bureau’s headquarters — has been posted as director general for Lahore region.
Mr Ahmed, a former federal secretary with experience of serving on a number of key positions, was inducted into the bureau about a month ago.
When contacted, the NAB’s spokesman termed the reshuffle a “pending matter” as no changes had been made in the bureau in the last three to four years.
He said the bureau’s new director general for Lahore, Jamil Ahmed, had a long experience of working with law and justice departments and had taken charge of his fresh assignment on Thursday.
While working as chairperson of the Benami Adjudicating Authority in Federal Board of Revenue, Mr Ahmed gained tremendous experience of firming up and implementing anti-benami legal frameworks for curbing white-collar crimes as well as institutional development under the Benami Transaction (Prohibition) Act, 2017, sources said.
The position provided him with ample opportunities for understanding the nature and manifestation of white-collar crimes, mechanism for parking of illicitly obtained wealth in the garb of benami properties and holdings as well as tactical aspects of investigation, prosecution, recovery and confiscation of benami properties.
Mr Ahmed, who joined the Civil Service as a District Management Group (Pakistan Administrative Service) officer in 1986, also served as home secretary of Gilgit-Baltistan, officer in charge of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council, secretary of the Federal Tax Ombudsman, secretary of the public health engineering department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, federal secretary of the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination, and joint secretary (monitoring) at the PM Secretariat.
Under the reshuffle, Mirza Sultan Muhammed Saleem, who was serving as director general of the T&R Division, has been posted as director general for Sukkur region.
Director general of the A&P Division Mansoor Alam Khan has now been transferred to the Operations Division at the bureau’s headquarters.

3,"Zardari, Nawaz damaged economy through foreign debts: minister",Holds media responsible for keeping opposition alive.,"LAHORE: Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain has said that political leaders like Asif Ali Zardari and Nawaz Sharif have caused severe damage to the national economy through foreign debts and the PTI government had to pay off those loans.
Talking to the media on Thursday along with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Shahbaz Gill, he said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had vanished in the local government (LG) elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Mr Chaudhry advised PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz to express sympathy with her party’s losing candidates and motivate them after their sheer defeat in the KP LG elections, instead of celebrating the victory of other opposition parties.
He said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) was still the largest political party at the village council level in KP.

Holds media responsible for keeping opposition alive

Mr Chaudhry said Asif Zardari used wheelchair whenever he appeared before a court, trying to show that he was suffering from serious diseases, but after getting a bail he started raising hollow slogans and making tall claims.
The minister said the PPP even did not have the candidates to contest elections in Punjab as Asif Zardari’s policies had made the party unpopular in the country.
He said such political parties were alive only because of the media and programmes at private TV channels. These parties would be eliminated the day the media would stop giving them coverage, he added.
Mr Chaudhry said the sole purpose of such political parties was to spread negative propaganda over the issue of inflation, adding that those who were ruling Sindh for 30 years have now claimed to make a plan for that province.
These political leaders could not even visit Larkana and Nawabshah due to their unpopularity, what to talk of becoming a power in Islamabad and Lahore, he added. Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari would have to spend their lives now in foreign countries, he added.
The minister said that previous governments did not build any dam after Tarbela and Mangla, but the PTI government started work on constructing new dams after which the water reservoirs had increased significantly. There were about 200,000 companies working in the country, out of which 157,000 were set up during the past 30 months, he said.
He said the PTI government had put focus on development of the agriculture sector due to which five major crops had yielded bumper production, adding that production of rice, wheat and corn was historic while the cotton crop went up by 44 per cent.
Mr Chaudhry said Pakistan’s economic growth was moving in the right direction as the country had witnessed a record sale of motorcycles, vehicles and agriculture pesticides.
He said the previous governments had taken $55 billion debt and it would have to be returned over the next five years.
The minister said Pakistan, as per vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan, had successfully overcome the Covid-19 pandemic. He said that under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, Pakistan was moving towards progress and prosperity.
Speaking on the occasion, PM’s special assistant Shahbaz Gill said that times had changed and the people understood how the PML-N and the PPP derailed the economic process and deprived the residents of Sindh of their basic rights.
He said the people wanted to know who spent such a huge amount in the wedding ceremony of Junaid Safdar, as his mother had claimed that she did not own any property, neither in Pakistan nor in London, while his father’s monthly income was Rs1,500.
Adviser to the PM on Trade and Investment in the United Kingdom and Europe Sahibzada Jahangir said the people of Pakistan could not even imagine to what extent Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari owned properties worth billions of dollars in London.
He said that nine million overseas Pakistanis respect and love Prime Minister Imran Khan due to his honesty and commitment to put Pakistan on the way to progress and prosperity.

4,Court annuls slow meter charges of SSGC,QUETTA: The Balochistan High Court has nullified adding of PUG (passing unregistered gas) / slow meter charges to...,"QUETTA: The Balochistan High Court has nullified adding of PUG (passing unregistered gas) / slow meter charges to consumers’ monthly bills by the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), saying just on the basis of doubt nobody could be assumed to be a gas thief.
A BHC bench comprising Chief Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Abdul Hameed Baloch annou­nced on Thursday its verdict on a petition filed by lawyers Syed Nazeer Agha, Farzana Khilji and Sultana Sarwar against the SSGC, which is sending thousands of rupees PUG / slow meter charges with gas bills to the consumers.
The court asked how a consumer could be charged PUG / slow meter charges on the basis of doubt. It was in conflict with Articles 8, 9 and 25 of the Constitution which dealt with basic human rights, it observed.
Regarding additional deposit charges, the court said that if any consumer had a complaint in this regard, he should approach the Consumer Court. All the courts of magistrates are consumer courts.
The verdict said that a notice should be issued to the user before removing his gas meter.
During the hearing, the SSGC presented a report on gas pressure in Ziarat district, stating that the supply of gas to 6,000 consumers of Ziarat had been started from Kuchlak through a 16-inch-diameter pipeline. However, in more than 70 villages along the way, gas pressure is affected through pressure regulation stations.
According to the report, juniper forests in Ziarat are at risk due to non-availability of gas and low pressure. The gas company is finding it difficult to deliver gas to the hilly areas of Ziarat and has planned to lay a 21km pipeline which will solve the problem of gas pressure in Ziarat.
Rukhsana Kakar advocate and Kashif Panizai, joint secretary of Ziarat Bar Association, told the court that when VIPs visited Ziarat, there was no problem of gas pressure in the area.

Speaking at a meeting of fishermen in Ormara, he said nobody would be allowed to rob sea resources as it was the right of local fishermen to earn their livelihood from Balochistan sea waters.
Maulana Rehman warned the chief minister and provincial government that if the agreement reached between the government and the movement leaders was not honoured and implemented by the government, the movement would stage a massive protest sit-in of more than one million people in Quetta after three months.
“Our struggle will continue till all check-posts of security forces are removed and illegal fishing in Balochistan sea waters by trawlers was stopped,” Maulana Rehman said.
He said that Balochistan fishermen had been deprived of their livelihood because of illegal fishing by trawlers and they had plundered resources of Balochistan’s sea.
“Resources of the province are ours, Balochistan is ours, CPEC is ours, the beach is ours and Gwadar Port is also ours,” he said, adding that the city of Ormara belonged to local people and it was not the private property of any person, but it was the collective property of the people of Balochistan.
“From now on, if the Pakistan Navy builds a fence, it will have to ask the people of Ormara or else we will cut the fence and destroy it,” the maulana declared.

A total of 15,398 families have been affected and they would receive the cash assistance. Accordingly, the process of disbursement is under way.
Senator Dr Sania Nishtar said that the delay in reaching out to all affected people was because most of the people were still unaware of the relief package.
However, some people said they had gone to collect the payment but were unable to do so because of CNIC expiry, biometric failure or non-presence of family registration in the database. “We conducted a midcourse review district-wide and results of the quick telephonic survey revealed that most of the people who had still not received their Ehsaas cash of Rs12,000 were unaware of the programme,” said Dr Sania Nishtar.
