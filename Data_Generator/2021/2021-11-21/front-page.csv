0,"No one can dare dictate judiciary, says CJP",Kurd says Pakistan’s judiciary has the lowest ranking in the world due to its functioning,"LAHORE: Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmad on Saturday strongly denied having made any judicial decision under the pressure of any institution. 
“Neither I have taken dictation from anyone nor anyone has ever dared to dictate me,” he said, rejecting an ass­­ertion of former president of Supreme Court Bar Ass­o­c­iation (SCBA) Ali Ahmad Kurd that the judiciary was under pressure from the po­­w­ers that be in the country. 
CJP Gulzar was chief gu­est at the inaugural session of two-day Asma Jahan­gir Conference co-hosted by the SCBA. 
He said it was very inappropriate to make allegations against the entire judiciary merely through a general statement. 
“At least I have never taken pressure from any institution. I have always decided cases as per my understanding of law and the Constitution,” he said and reiterated that no one had ever interfered in his judicial work. 

Kurd says Pakistan’s judiciary has the lowest ranking in the world due to its functioning

Justice Ahmad said he believed that all his brother judges had the same characteristics. 
He asked Mr Kurd to visit the courts and observe their working as the judges delivered justice to people on a daily basis. 
“Come and see with what independence our courts are working,” he said while extending the invitation to the former president of the SCBA. The chief justice said the judgements being passed by the courts on a daily basis were being published in books.  
He reiterated that the judiciary could not be targeted through a generalised statement without quoting any specific instance. 
“The decisions of the courts are seen as an evolutionary process. The judiciary in every country of the world has gone through the same evolutionary process. Some decisions of the courts are good and some are bad,” he explained. 
However, he said, people termed the decisions of the courts good or bad as per their own opinions. 
He said everyone was free to have an opinion and this right was respected in the democratic system. “This is the beauty of our judicial and democratic system,” he added. 
Chief Justice Ahmad said: “Our courts are free to decide cases and conduct accountability of everyone involved in any case before them.” 
“Just disclose if there is any decision passed on the dictation of anyone. This assertion is not true. Do not create confusion and misunderstanding among the people. Do not try to shake the trust of the people in the institutions,” he said in the obvious context of Mr Kurd’s remarks. 
The chief justice said there was rule of law, not rule of men, in the country. 
He said the courts would continue to promote supremacy of the constitution and advocacy of democracy in the country. 
“We will not accept any undemocratic set-up. We will leave as we did in the past,” he concluded. 
Earlier, Mr Kurd said the late Asma Jahangir was a voice of the poor of the country. He said she had always spoken truth before the powerful without any fear. 
He expressed reservations over the title of the conference’s inaugural session, “The role of judiciary in protecting human rights and strengthening democracy”. “What judiciary are you talking about?” he asked the organisers. 
He regretted that the judiciary of Pakistan was on the lowest in the world ranking due to its functioning. 
He claimed that there was a clear division within the judiciary. 
Mr Kurd said one army general was superior to the 220 million citizens of the country. 
He alleged that the general was the reason behind the deplorable ranking of Pakistan’s judiciary. 
The fiery speech of Mr Kurd caused uneasiness among the organisers of the conference as the participants, particularly students, kept shouting slogans. 
SCBA President Ahsan Bhoon had to intervene and ask the participants to maintain decorum of the event. 
Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Athar Minallah acknowledged the criticism of Mr Kurd on the judiciary. 
He said: “It is very important for us to know what the bar and the people think about us.” 
Responding to Mr Kurd, he said: “No judge who is independent can ever make an excuse that he can be pressurised or influenced. Any such excuse is a violation of the oath that judges take.” 
Justice Minallah said the judiciary could not refuse to accept its mistakes. 
Speaking on the occasion, Justice Qazi Faez Isa of the Supreme Court said failure to abide by the Constitution had divided Pakistan into two countries and caused untold misery. 
He said: “We need to reflect upon, admit and accept our mistakes, set aside our arrogance and delusions, seek forgiveness and promise never to violate the Constitution again. Only then there is the possibility of being forgiven by the people.” 
He paid tribute to Asma Jahangir calling her an iron lady of Pakistan. 
In his speech, SCBA president Bhoon said dictators or representatives of imperial forces had used religion as a tool to perpetuate their rule.  
In Pakistan, he said, a dictator namely Ziaul Haq, used the same practice and inserted Article 62 (1)(F) in the Constitution, which required that parliamentarians should be “Sadiq and Ameen”. 
He said to be Sadiq and Ameen was a virtue of prophets whereas all humans were fallible whether they be judges, parliamentarians or representatives of any other segment of society. 
He said being in conflict with the basic spirit of Islam, the provisions of Article 162 (1)(f) inserted in the constitution were liable to be struck down. 
Mr Bhoon said power used by the Supreme Court under Article 184 (3) did not provide right of appeal to the aggrieved parties. He termed this a violation of Article 10 A of the Constitution and demanded amendment to the rules of the Supreme Court to grant right of appeal to the aggrieved party.

1,FO rubbishes India claims about seizure of radioactive consignment,"Calls Indian media report ""factually incorrect, baseless and laughable"".","ISLAMABAD: The Fore­ign Office on Saturday rej­ec­ted Indian claims about the seizure of a potentially radioactive consignment on board a vessel that originated from Karachi, and clarified it contained empty containers that had previously been used for shipping fuel for K-2 and K-3 Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs). 
“The reporting by the Ind­ian media about seizure of possible radioactive material is factually incorrect, bas­eless, laughable and a usual ploy of the Indian me­dia to malign Pakistan and mislead the internatio­nal community,” FO spokesman Asim Iftikhar said in a statement. 
Indian company Adani Ports, which manages Mun­dra Port where the Indian authorities offloaded several containers from a Shanghai-bound vessel on Thursday, had through a statement claimed: “A joint Customs and DRI team seized several containers at Mundra Port from a foreign vessel on concerns that they contained undeclared hazardous cargo.” 
The Indian company said the cargo was listed as non-hazardous in the documents, although the seized containers allegedly had Hazard Class 7 markings indicating radioactive substances. Therefore, it said, the authorities offloaded the cargo for further inspection. 
The FO spokesman, in his clarification said, the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant authorities had informed that the offloaded cargo contained ‘empty containers’ being returned to China and that they had previously been used for the transportation of fuel from China to Karachi for K-2 and K-3 NPPs. 
Both K-2 and K-3 NPPs and the fuel used in these plants are under the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, the spokesman underscored. They have been under the IAEA safeguards since March 2017. 
Safeguards are the measures through which the IAEA verifies that the nuclear facilities are not misused and nuclear material is not diverted from peaceful uses. 
Pakistani officials say that the country’s commitment to the IAEA safeguards is demonstrated by the fact that all of its nuclear power plants and research reactors are under the IAEA safeguards without exception and the implementation of these safeguards was ensured even during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
Rejecting the allegation of wrong declaration of the cargo in documents, the spokesman said the cargo was correctly declared as non-hazardous because the containers were empty. 
“The fake reporting by Indian media is indicative of a mala fide intent to twist procedural customs issues to bring into disrepute IAEA safeguarded nuclear power programme,” he added.

2,Punjab told to hold local govt polls early next year,Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry says a new bill will be presented before Punjab Assembly next week.,"• Bill to be tabled before assembly next week
• Direct vote to elect representatives, mayors
• Village council to comprise 13 members
• Five-year term of local bodies expiring on Dec 31     
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan has directed the Punjab government to hold local government (LG) elections in the province in the first quarter of next year.  
This was disclosed by federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry while talking to Dawn on Saturday. 
Mr Chaudhry said the prime minister had issued directives to Chief Minister Usman Buzdar and the minister for local government in this regard and the new local government bill would be presented before the Punjab Assembly next week. Providing some details of the proposed law, the minister said local representatives at the district level and mayors of the cities would be elected through a direct vote while the village council would comprise 13 members.  
The five-year term of the local governments in Punjab is expiring on Dec 31. 
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had reportedly already told the Punjab government to ensure compliance with its directions on holding of local government elections in the province within 120 days after Dec 31, failing which it may exercise the option of passing “order” as it did in case of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Islamabad Capital Territory. 
“On the expiry of the term of local government institutions on the 31st December 2021, the ECP is determined to conduct next LG elections in the Punjab Province, in any way, within 120 days as required under subsection (4) of the section-219 of the Elections Act, 2017. In case of lacklustre response or non-compliance of the directions, the commission may exercise the option of passing “order” as it did in case of KP & ICT,” the commission warned in a letter to the Punjab’s Local Government and Community Development Department (LGCD). 
On Oct 14, the ECP had rejected the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government’s plan to hold LG polls in the province in three phases, ordering it to complete the electoral process for the lowest tier of government by March 2022. 
The officials of the provincial ECP had held a number of meetings with the provincial government representatives on the conduct of LG elections in the province, and in these meetings, the commission had categorically stated that the ECP was fully conscious of its constitutional obligations for holding elections in the province as required under Article-219 of the Constitution, but no result-oriented progress has been made by the government. 
“The commission, keeping in view the situation, wants the LG department to convey to the Punjab government that: “Necessary laws/rules governing the conduct of local government elections in Punjab are required to be updated, if required. The up-dated Local Government Act-2019 and PLG (Elections) Rules-2021 may be provided to the ECP by November 30, 2021,” the ECP had directed. 
The commission has also asked the government to provide it pre-requisite for delimitation of constituencies, such as notification regarding the number of villages and neighbourhoods, an updated notification of all local areas showing notified population along with the documents relating to demarcation of local areas, copies of authenticated maps of LG showing the clear boundaries by Nov 30, 2021, positively to start the process well in time. 
The Buzdar administration in Punjab had reluctantly restored the local governments in the province to comply with a Supreme Court order subject to the outcome of its petitions seeking a review of the judgement in October. 
The PTI-led coalition government in Punjab had dissolved the local bodies constituted under the Punjab Local Government Act 2013 in May 2019 soon after coming to power. 
The PTI government had superseded the PLGA 2013 by promulgating the PLGA 2019 and the chief minister had immediately appointed LG administrators on May 4, 2019 – some 30 months ahead of completion of the tenure of LG representatives mostly belonging to the PML-N. 
The administrators continued exercising these powers for over 29 months, including the seven months since the Supreme Court had issued a short order on March 25 declaring PLGA 2019’s Section 3 ultra vires to the Constitution. 
The Punjab government initially delayed implementation of the Supreme Court order on the pretext that it was waiting for the detailed judgement, and later that it had filed a review petition after the detailed verdict was issued in July. 
It swiftly restored the local bodies only after the apex court expressed dismay over non-compliance with its March 25 order, and summoned both the incumbent as well as the former chief secretaries of Punjab. 
On Nov 19, the ECP had notified the schedule for delimitation of constituencies for the local government elections in Sindh, Balochistan and Islamabad.

3,Plea filed against former GB chief judge,"Petition requests court to proceed against Shamim, direct the federal govt to place his name on the no-fly list.","ISLAMABAD: A petition has been filed in the Islam­abad High Court (IHC) seeking recovery of salaries received by former chief judge of the top court of Gilgit-Baltistan, Rana Moh­a­m­mad Shamim, for issuing a controversial affidavit. 
Justice Shamim in the Nov 16 affidavit had claimed that former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar had asked an IHC judge to delay grant of bail to PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz. 
Chaudhry Mohammad Akram, a former vice president of the Islamabad Bar Association, in his petition cited Rana Shamim and the secretaries of law and justice and interior as respondents. 
IHC Justice Tariq Meh­mood Jahangiri will take up the petition on Monday (tomorrow). 
According to the petition, the former chief judge’s affidavit was a violation of Article 5 of the Constitution that requires every citizen to be loyal with the state and obedient to the constitution.  
Advocate Akram contends in the petition that Rana Shamim has tried to scandalise the judiciary which is an important pillar of the state. 
The petition requests the court to proceed against Rana Shamim and direct the federal government to place his name on Exit Control List. 
The petition also says that since Rana Shamim has violated his oath of office, he should be treated as an alien to the office of the chief judge and stopped from using the title of former chief judge. Besides he should be disqualified from holding any public office in future. 
The petition also seeks recovery of salaries drawn by Rana Shamim as chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan. 
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah has already initiated contempt proceedings against Rana Shamim, Editor-in-Chief of Jang Group Mir Shakeelur Rehman, Editor Investigation Ansar Abbasi and Resident Editor Aamir Ghouri. 
The chief justice’s order issued after a preliminary hearing on Nov 15 stated: “The news report and the purported affidavit have cast scandalous aspersions on the integrity, independence and impartiality of the Court and its judges. Liberty of the press and freedom of speech are of paramount importance but they are not absolute. They are subservient to proper administration of justice.” 
The court noted that the alleged contemnors has tried to undermine public confidence in impartiality and independence of the IHC and its judges. 
The IHC CJ also said this episode had created an opportunity for accountability of the judiciary. “This is an opportunity for holding this Court accountable. The onus is on the alleged contemnors to establish their bona fides by satisfying that the alleged aspersions are not unfounded to the extent of this Court and its Honourable Judges.”
