1,"Bowlers, Fakhar steer Pakistan to T20 series win over Bangladesh",DHAKA: Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman struck an unbeaten half-century as his side made light work of beating Bangladesh ...,"DHAKA: Pakistan’s Fakhar Zaman struck an unbeaten half-century as his side made light work of beating Bangladesh by eight wickets in their second Twenty20 international in Dhaka on Saturday, taking an unassailable 2-0 series lead. 
Fakhar hit 57 off 51 balls and put on 85 runs with opener Mohammad Rizwan for the second wicket that was instrumental in overhauling Bangladesh’s paltry 108-7 with 11 balls to spare. 
Rizwan scored a patient 39 off 45 with four boundaries. 
Fakhar was watchful after captain Babar Azam (5) dragged fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman’s (1-12) delivery on to his stump in the third over, similar to his dismissal in the first match. 
“Wasn’t easy to play shots early on, wanted to build partnerships and succeeded,” Fakhar said. “Thankfully we finished it off well.” 
He paced the innings, especially after being reprieved on 26 when Saif Hassan dropped his catch in deep midwicket off leg-spinner Aminul Islam (1-30). 
Aminul finally dismissed Rizwan as Saif took the catch at extra cover, but it came too late as Fakhar soon sealed the contest and the series with a single through cover off part-timer Saif as Pakistan got to 109-2. 
“The series win is a team effort,” said Babar. “The boys responded well as a unit and we carried forward the momentum from the World Cup.” 
Playing his first match of the series, Shaheen Shah Afridi (2-15) and Shadab Khan (2-22) caused the damage to Bangladesh amid Najmul Hossain Shanto’s resistance after captain Mahmudullah opted to bat first. 
Najmul struck 40 off 34, hitting five fours. 
Shaheen, replacing Hasan Ali, continued his habit to strike in the first over as he trapped Saif leg-before for duck in the fifth ball. 
Mohammad Naim Sheikh edged Mohammad Wasim’s delivery to Fakhar at first slip for two in the second over, leaving Bangladesh at 5-2. 
Afif Hossain flicked Shaheen to six over backward square leg in the first ball he faced. He also cut Wasim past point for a boundary as Bangladesh appeared to be in control. 
Najmul, at the other end, recovered from his vulnerable start to dominate bowlers. 
But Shadab stifled the innings and brought an end to the 46-run partnership when Afif’s premeditated reverse paddle cost his wicket for 20. 
Najmul chipped in the air to give Shadab, who dived to his left to take an excellent catch, his second wicket. 
Haris Rauf in between took the wicket of Mahmudullah, edging to wicket-keeper for 12, as the home team was 82-5 in 14th over. 
Shaheen and Wasim came back to their second spells to torment Bangladesh further, allowing them to score just 23 runs in the last five overs. 
Mahmudullah rued Bangladesh’s batting towards the end of their innings. 
“We started well, Afif and Shanto batted well and we were trying to get a partnership but didn’t capitalize in the last few overs,” Mahmudullah said. “For a team like us, we need a set batter to be there at the end but it didn’t happen today.” 
Pakistan won the first match of the series by four wickets on Friday. The third and final match of the series will be held on the same ground on Monday

2,Cricket Australia chairman admits mistake not axing Tim Paine earlier,"“The role of Australia captain must be held to the highest standards,"" he says.","SYDNEY: Cricket Australia (CA) chairman Richard Freudenstein on Saturday admitted the governing body should have axed Tim Paine as Test captain in 2018 after a sexting scandal that  “sent the wrong message that this kind of behaviour is acceptable”.
Paine abruptly quit on Friday, just weeks ahead of the Ashes series against England, over a series of lewd text messages with a female colleague in 2017 that he had learnt was about to be made public.
The incident was investigated in 2018 but Paine was cleared by Cricket Tasmania and CA’s integrity unit of breaching their code of conduct and was able to stay on.
Freudenstein, who was elected to the board in 2019, insisted Paine would not have survived as captain in 2018 under the sport’s current administration.
“While I cannot speak about the original decision-making in 2018 ... with the benefit of all relevant information about this matter, Cricket Australia would not make the same decision today,” he said at a press conference.
“I acknowledge that the decision clearly sent the wrong message to the sport, to the community and to Tim -- that this kind of behaviour is acceptable and without serious consequences.
“The role of Australia captain must be held to the highest standards,” he added.
Paine took over the Test captaincy in March 2018 in the wake of the  “Sandpaper-gate” scandal that rocked Australian cricket.
Then-captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner were forced to step down for their roles in trying to alter the ball with sandpaper during a Cape Town Test and were suspended for a year.
Freudenstein said that since 2018 CA had put in place better education for players over acceptable behaviour and social media use, including the exchange of sexually explicit material.
“But what is clear is that there are lessons to be learnt and we, as an organisation, have more to do and will do more in this area,” he added.
While admitting it was a mistake to keep Paine in the role, Freudenstein also praised him as an  “exceptional leader in Australian cricket over the last three years”.
He also confirmed the 36-year-old wicket-keeper, who is on the comeback from neck surgery, was available for Ashes selection as a player in the opening Test at Brisbane on Dec 8.
“The captain of the Australian cricket team has to be held to a very high standard,” he said. “Which is why I think it is absolutely appropriate that Tim has resigned the captaincy which is in the best interest of Australian cricket.
“The board of Australian cricket is comfortable with his availability as a player.”
Pat Cummins and Smith are seen as the frontrunners to take over as skipper.

3,"US, UN demand proof of Peng’s well-being",BEIJING: The United States and United Nations demanded proof of Peng Shuai’s whereabouts as a Chinese...,"BEIJING: The United States and United Nations demanded proof of Peng Shuai’s whereabouts as a Chinese state-affiliated journalist shared unverified photos of the tennis star, who has not been seen publicly since accusing a former vice-premier of forcing her to have sex.
Images of a smiling Peng emerged on a Chinese state-affiliated Twitter account late Friday, but their authenticity could not be verified and the user did not respond to a request for comment.
Earlier White House press secretary Jen Psaki said President Joe Biden’s administration wanted China to  “provide independent, verifiable proof” of Peng’s whereabouts and expressed  “deep concern” about the former top-ranked doubles player.
The United Nations insisted on a fully transparent investigation into the claims made by Peng against Communist Party grandee Zhang Gaoli — the first time China’s #MeToo movement has touched the highest echelons of the country’s politics.
Peng, 35, alleged on the Chinese social media site Weibo earlier this month that Zhang, now in his 70s, had  “forced” her into sex during an on-off relationship spanning several years.
The claims were quickly scrubbed from the Twitter-like platform and Peng has not been seen publicly since.
“It would be important to have proof of her whereabouts and well-being,” Liz Throssell, a spokeswoman for the UN Human Rights Office, told reporters in Geneva. “We are calling for an investigation with full transparency into her allegation of sexual assault.”
Other tennis stars, sports bodies, governments and human rights defenders have added to the growing clamour for information. The head of the WTA, the top world body for women’s tennis, has said the organisation is willing to lose hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Chinese business in one of its biggest markets to ensure Peng’s wellbeing.
China has repeatedly refused to comment on the case.
On Saturday, Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor of the Communist Party-owned Global Times, tweeted:  “she will show up in public and participate in some activities soon.”

4,Chelsea cruise as Kante rocket inspires Leicester rout,Chelsea are genuine title contenders this season.,"LEICESTER: Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante marked his latest return to former club Leicester City with a brilliant individual goal to help the Premier League leaders to a 3-0 win on Saturday. 
There was also a second league goal of the season for Christian Pulisic after his entrance as a second-half substitute as Chelsea swept aside a team they battled against last season just to secure a top-four finish. 
Chelsea are genuine title contenders this season, extending their advantage at the top of the table to six points ahead of the rest of the weekend’s matches. 
It helps having players of the ilk of Kante, and his goal showed another side to his incredible all-round game that helped Leicester win the Premier League at preseason odds of 5,000-1 in the 2015-16 season. 
Chelsea were already leading thanks to Antonio Rudiger’s back-header off a 14th-minute corner by Ben Chilwell when Kante collected a short pass from Reece James just inside Leicester’s half. 
He drove toward the penalty area unchallenged as Wilfried Ndidi tried to get back to him, before shifting the ball to his left foot and sending in a shot that flew into the corner, giving goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel no chance in the 28th. 
Pulisic made the points safe nine minutes after coming on as a substitute in the 62nd. The US forward was picked out in the middle of the penalty area by a pass from fellow substitute Hakim Ziyech and took a touch before producing a finish on the slide through Schmeichels legs. 
It was Pulisic’s second league goal of the season, having also scored on the opening day against Crystal Palace. 
The victory was the ideal preparation for Chelsea’s big week that features a crucial Champions League tie against Juventus on Tuesday before Manchester United visit Stamford Bridge on November 28. 
Their fifth from six away league games this season moved the Blues onto 29 points, six clear of second-placed champions Manchester City, who play West Ham United on Sunday. Leicester are well off the pace in 12th after their fifth loss of the season.

5,Pakistan squad off to India for Jr Hockey World Cup,The 16-nation global event is being staged at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar from Nov 24 to Dec 5.,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s junior hockey squad on Saturday reached New Delhi from Dubai on its way to Bhubaneswar to feature in the World Cup being held there from Nov 24.
According to the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), the national squad upon its arrival in New Delhi was received by Pakistan’s High Commissioner to India Aftab Hasan Khan who hosted a lunch in the honour of the squad.
The 16-nation global event is being staged at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar from Nov 24 to Dec 5. Pakistan are placed in pool ‘D’ alongside Argentina, Egypt and Germany.
The Pakistan squad had to reach Bhubaneswar the same afternoon as it will play the first practice match there against Chile on Sunday.
Prior to the squad’s departure from Lahore to Sialkot to fly for India, head coach Danish Kaleem said the boys were in high spirits to give their best.
“Despite the problems that emerged due to Covid-19 pandemic the boys have worked hard for this event,” the coach said. “The two practice matches will also help our players assess their strength and weaknesses before they face Germany in the first match on Nov 24.”

6,"One year to go until 2022 World Cup, clock ticks ever louder for Qatar","The opening match will take place on Nov 21 in the 60,000 capacity Al Bayt Stadium.","DOHA: Sunday marks the point where it is one year to go until the opening match of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, with the tournament, played for the first time in a northern hemisphere winter, rapidly taking shape. 
The opening match will take place on Nov 21 in the 60,000 capacity Al Bayt Stadium.  
Kickoff will no doubt come as some relief to organisers as the football takes centre stage, shifting the limelight away from the numerous off-pitch issues, such as labour rights for migrant workers, that have surrounded the event.
Given Qatar is the smallest country in size (11,600 km2) to host a World Cup, and, as all the stadiums are situated in and around the capital Doha, supporters can attend multiple games on the same day.
Fans around the globe watching on TV can tune in to an unprecedented four back-to-back matches in one day.
There will be no repeat of the last-minute rush to finish stadiums and infrastructure, as was the case at the 2014 tournament in Brazil.
According to the organising Supreme Committee, five of the eight stadiums purpose-built for the World Cup are complete.
Two more — the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium and Al Bayt — will be inaugurated during the Arab Cup, a dress rehearsal event which starts on Nov 30 and finishes a year to the day before the World Cup final on Dec 18. 
The last arena to be finished is the Lusail Stadium — the venue for the final. 
“For all those who love football, this will be like a toy shop is for a child,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said this week.  
“There will be eight, state-of-the-art stadiums some of the most beautiful stadiums in the world within 50 kilometres (of each other), so it’s going to be great. The World Cup is an occasion to get to know other cultures and other people.” 
Getting around Doha, according to the organisers, is not going to be an issue either. 
“When it comes to our progress, we have completed 98% of the infrastructure works,” Fatma Al-Nuaimi, spokesperson for the supreme committee, told reporters. 
Twelve months before the kick-off, the Qatari capital Doha, which is hosting almost the entire tournament, is dotted with roadworks and building sites that are causing chaos for its inhabitants. 
With some Qatari infrastructure projects delayed by the pandemic, the clock is ticking more loudly than organisers might have liked, just as scrutiny of the preparations starts to rise. 
LABOUR SYSTEM 
Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup has been controversial.  
As recently as April last year, organisers strongly denied allegations from the US Department of Justice that bribes were paid to secure votes when the hosting rights were awarded in 2010.
The feasibility of playing a tournament in the searing Middle Eastern summer heat led to the event being shunted out of its traditional timeslot and played later in the year, while Qatar’s labour system has been strongly criticised.
The government of Qatar said on Tuesday its labour system is still a work in progress but denied accusations in a report by Amnesty International that thousands of migrant workers were being exploited. 
Qatar has also come under fire for its criminalisation of homosexuality.  
“Since we won the World Cup (rights) we have received a lot of criticism. There is constructive criticism that we tried to take on board,” Al-Nuaimi said last month. “We also try not to let this criticism stop us.” 
A 48-page report by Amnesty, Reality Check 2021, said that practices such as withholding salaries and charging workers to change jobs were still rife. Qatar’s Government Communication Office rejected the allegations.  
Players from Germany, the Netherlands and Norway have since worn shirts before World Cup qualifiers voicing concern over human rights in Qatar and there could be further protests in the leadup to the tournament. 
Resource-rich Qatar has been active in other sports apart from football, holding the world athletics championships in 2019 and its inaugural Formula One grand prix takes place on Sunday, exactly a year before the World Cup opens. 
But the World Cup, with 1.2 million visitors pouring in — nearly half the country’s population — is an undertaking of an altogether different scale.
Serious questions are being asked about where the fans will stay, with reservations already closed at Doha’s limited collection of hotels.  
Officials have talked about providing floating hotels and promoting home-stays, while many fans will end up in newly built apartments and even air-conditioned tents.
Even so, accommodating such numbers — about 300,000 a day, plus 150,000 World Cup workers, according to one source with knowledge of the matter — looks difficult. 
‘UNCHARTED WATERS’
“This World Cup is being implemented in uncharted waters: there has never been a mega-sporting event with so many visitors and working staff in addition to the regular population on such a small territory who will stay put for the duration,” the source said. “There is simply no historic experience to draw from.” 
Fans from the majority of the traditional big hitters will be starting to plan their trips.
Brazil and Argentina will be there, while the first European group qualification phase is over with holders France sailing through.  
Uruguay could be a notable absentee given their poor form in qualification, while the last two European champions Italy and Portugal must negotiate a tricky 12-team European playoff system to compete in the finals. 
Expectations are low for Qatar, who will make their World Cup debut after qualifying as hosts, despite their impressive Asian Cup victory in 2019. 
Meanwhile, Qatar has pledged to vaccinate fans who are not inoculated against Covid-19, while FIFA has moved to allay concerns about the availability of alcohol in the Muslim country, where it is largely banned. 
“[Alcohol] will be available in designated areas during the upcoming FIFA World Cup,” a FIFA spokesperson said.

TURIN: Serbia’s Novak Djokovic celebrates after winning the ATP Finals round-robin match against Cameron Norrie of Britain at the Pala Alpitour.—AFP

 
TURIN: Casper Ruud will face Daniil Medvedev in the last four of the ATP Finals after coming from behind to beat Andrey Rublev 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5) on Friday, while Djokovic closed out the Green Group with a 6-2, 6-1 destruction of Cameron Norrie.
The Norwegian has followed up a brilliant year in which he won five tournaments by reaching the semis in his first appearance at the season-ending event.
Both Ruud and Rublev knew a win at the Pala Alpitour in Turin would take them into the semi-finals and Ruud impressed in coming from behind to make sure he will be taking on the world number two.
He did it despite being demolished in the first set by fifth seed Rublev, who then looked certain to be facing his countryman at the weekend after breaking Ruud’s serve in game three of the second set.
Fifth seed Rublev came into the match unbeaten in his four previous meetings with Ruud but after a strong start fell to a deserved defeat, failing to qualify for the knockout rounds from the Green Group.
Djokovic showed just how difficult it will be to stop him from winning a record-equalling sixth Finals title in his straight sets demolition of Briton Norrie, who leaves the tournament without a win under his belt after replacing injured Stefanos Tsitsipas.World number one Djokovic broke Norrie in the first game of the evening and from then on blitzed the 26-year-old, who barely laid a glove on the 20-time Grand Slam winner in a match which lasted just over an hour.
He barely broke a sweat, winning every one of his service games and breaking Norrie five times in a typically dominating display from the Serb ahead of his semi-final showdown with third seed Alexander Zverev.
Djokovic was in good spirits after the match and after a breezy post-match interview carried out exclusively in Italian he batted a few balls into a crowd who will almost certainly be supporting him in the semi.
“I played very ell from the first to the last point... There weren’t many negatives to my play,” said Djokovic in Italian on the court.

Bundesliga leaders Bayern suffered a shock 2-1 loss at Augsburg who struck twice against the run of play in the first half and held on after Lewandowski pulled a goal back to record a memorable victory in Friday’s Bavarian derby. 
Goals from Mads Pedersen and Andre Hahn in the 23rd and 36th minutes put the hosts in the driving seat, before Lewandowski reduced the arrears in the 38th, as Augsburg earned their third win in 21 Bundesliga matches against Bayern, who were without Germany midfielder Joshua Kimmich who is back in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.
The result snapped Bayern’s four-game winning run in the league but they are still top of the table on 28 points, provisionally four ahead of Borussia Dortmund. Augsburg’s victory lifted them out of the relegation zone into 15th place. 
“For us, this is of course a bitter setback in how we see ourselves, how we actually want to play the games,” Thomas Mueller said after his 600th competitive game for Bayern “We need that every match, this confirmation that we’re the ones who dictate and dominate the games. And that doesn’t mean ball possession, but the way and manner in which you play on an opponent.” 
Augsburg started with intent, playing at pace and caught Bayern with a sucker punch when Pedersen powered home a low shot for his maiden Bundesliga goal. 
With Bayern, who visit Dynamo Kyiv in the Champions League next week, struggling to create chances, Augsburg struck again. 
Bayern’s Marcel Sabitzer lost possession in his own half and Hahn rose above the defence to head in a perfect Iago cross. 
The celebrations of the home fans were dampened two minutes later when Bundesliga top scorer Lewandowski netted his 14th league goal from a Mueller assist to cut the deficit. 
But Augsburg remained disciplined in defence after the break and looked comfortable as they soaked up the Bayern pressure.

After carding 71 in each the first two rounds of the National Amateur Golf Championship, Nouman shot a 72 to move to two-under 214 at the end of the third here at the PAF Golf Course on Saturday to open up an eight-stroke lead at the top of the leaderboard. 
The four-handicapper opened with a bogey but then birdied the second before another bogey followed at the third. Two back-to-back birdies followed on the next two holes before another bogey on the sixth as he wrapped up the front nine at one-over. Two birdies and a bogey on the back nine saw him finish on even-par. 
Salman Jahangir’s strong back nine performance saw him emerge as Nouman’s closest rival as his 73 put him on six-over 222. 
Defending champion Omar Khalid posted his best score of this year’s event as a 73 put him a stroke further adrift, level with opening day leader Mohammad Shoaib (76) heading into Sunday’s final round. 
Saim Shazli (76) is at 225, two shots ahead of Hussain Hamid (73).  
Humna Amjad won the two-round ladies’ contest after a 72 saw her finish on two-over 146, four shots ahead of Rimsha Ejaz (73) and six ahead of Suneyah Osama (76).

Ben Yedder scored with an 83rd-minute volley for the principality side, shortly after Strahinja Pavlovic was sent off, adding to Krepin Diatta’s goal before halftime following Jonathan David’s early double for the visitors. 
“Coaches love to see that, a substitute scoring,” said Monaco coach Niko Kovac. “They never gave up, never stopped believing. It has the taste of a victory.” 
The result put Monaco, who had not scored in their three previous competitive games, provisionally in seventh place with 19 points from 14 matches, four points outside the top four spots. Lille are two points behind in 12th, having won only four games in the league so far this season.

Melbourne, where January’s Grand Slam is held, has spent more than 260 days under lockdown during the pandemic and the government of the state of Victoria made clear last month there would be no concessions for unvaccinated players.
Tiley said the playing group know they must get the jab to compete at Melbourne Park.
“There’s a lot of speculation about vaccination and just to be really clear, when the [Victoria] premier announced that everyone on site... will need to be vaccinated, we made that clear to the playing group,” he told Channel Nine television.
“All the playing group understands it, our patrons will need to be vaccinated, all the staff working at the Australian Open will need to be vaccinated.”
This includes nine-time champion Djokovic.
Tiley said the Serbian superstar, who would be gunning for a record 21st Grand Slam singles title if he competes in Melbourne,  “has said that he views this as a private matter for him”.
“We would love to see Novak here. He knows that he’ll have to be vaccinated to play here,” he added. “He’s won the Australian Open nine times, I think he’d love to make it double digits and win it 10 times.”
Djokovic said this month he would await official confirmation on the requirements from Tennis Australia before making a decision.
“I am going to decide on whether I go to Australia after I see an official statement from Tennis Australia,” he said on the eve of the Paris Masters.
“There has been no official announcement or statement and until that is out I won’t be talking about this any more. I do not want to be part of the stories about the assumptions and what ifs.”
Just 50 percent of players were fully vaccinated six weeks ago, but it shot up to 80 percent after the Victoria government’s announcement, Tiley said, adding that it was  “continuing to track towards 100 percent”.
The Australian Open went ahead this year, but players were forced to spend two weeks in hotel quarantine, crowds were restricted and a five-day snap lockdown was called mid-event.

The winners of the matches will earn the final two spots at next year’s World Cup in Qatar. 
FIFA cited unprecedented disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic when scheduling the games for June, more than two months later than the pre-pandemic schedule. Single games also avoid teams crossing several time zones for two-leg matchups.
A host was not announced for the two games, which will be played on June 13 and 14. 
The playoffs will feature the highest placed teams not to have automatically qualified from Asia, South America, Oceania and the CONCACAF (North and Central America and Caribbean) regions. 
Three of the playoff teams should be known by the end of March. Asia’s entry is scheduled to be decided in a regional playoff only days before the intercontinental playoffs. 
Two-legged intercontinental playoffs were introduced for the 1986 World Cup and typically demand long-haul travel. 
FIFA will make the World Cup tournament draw on April 1 in Doha. Only 30 of the 32 qualifiers will be known at the time, with the intercontinental playoffs still to come. 
The draw for the games will take place on Friday, following the draw for the European qualification playoffs. 
The World Cup is scheduled to start on Nov 21, with the final on Dec 18.

14,Thunder Snow comes from behind to win Memorial Cup,KARACHI: In a sheer surprise bay colt Thunder Snow came from behind to lift the Shah Mardan Shah II Pir Pagara VII...,"KARACHI: In a sheer surprise bay colt Thunder Snow came from behind to lift the Shah Mardan Shah II Pir Pagara VII Memorial Cup in the Gymkhana race meeting at the Karachi Racecourse on Saturday.
Thunder Snow got the better of bay horse G Sarkar by half-a-length as fancied pair of Sahil and Churchill bit the dust.
Filly Queen of Spades grabbed third place on board beaten by two lengths while Churchill completed the frame another half length behind.
Reigning Derby champion Sahil failed to finish on the board in his maiden run at the course perhaps due to the disadvantage of carrying 10-0 handicap on his back.
Thunder Snow who belongs to the stable of Ather Abbas and sent by trainer Nazir was ably ridden home by Lahore’s eminent rider Tahir Abbas.
Meanwhile, riders Waseem and Ali Raza II escaped injuries after falling from their mounts Lahori King and Fahad Jani respectively at three furlongs in the opening race. Favourite Lahori King who broke his leg was later destroyed.
Three favourites and as many rank outsiders shared the six-race card of the day.
The owner-rider duo of Ather and Tahir excelled with a double – Thunder Smile and Thunder Snow – in second and sixth race respectively.
The next Gymkhana race meeting will be held on Saturday (Nov 27).
