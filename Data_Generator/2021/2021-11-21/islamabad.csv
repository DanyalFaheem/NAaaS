1,Panchayat accused of delaying construction on H-9 plot in Islamabad,Pakistan Hindu Council chief says Panchayat is wasting the whole community's time.,"• Pakistan Hindu Council chief says Panchayat wasting time of whole community
• CDA backtracks from plot cancellation statement after backlash on social media
ISLAMABAD: After outcry on social media on the cancellation of a plot meant for the Hindu cremation ground and community centre, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) revised its statement in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), saying only those plots had been cancelled which were lying idle and that construction work was underway on the land allotted to the Hindu community.
On the other hand, the Islamabad Hindu Panchayat (IHP) has failed to build a boundary wall around the H-9 cremation ground even though the CDA issued permission for it almost a year ago.
Earlier, the CDA had told the IHC that the federal cabinet had cancelled all amenity plots where no construction work had commenced and it also included the plot allotted to the Hindu community.
However, a few hours later, following public outcry on social media, the CDA changed its stance and issued a statement denying that the plot had been cancelled.
It told the IHC that development activity was actually taking place on the 3.89 kanals of land for the community centre and cremation ground in H-9/2, and that the plot was not cancelled.
The Panchayat, meanwhile, has still not started building a wall, saying it was trying to arrange about Rs500,000 for the construction activity.
For this, a delegation of the Panchayat recently approached Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on CDA Affairs MNA Ali Nawaz Awan with a request that the civic body be asked to build the boundary wall on its own. Mr Awan assured the delegation of his cooperation.
Talking to Dawn, former IHP president Pritum Das said the community was short of finances and could not afford the construction cost, hoping the CDA would step in and carry out the construction.
But prominent member of the Hindu community Dr Ramesh Vankwani, who is an MNA and patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC), said the Panchayat was wasting time of the community.
“I have asked them to hand over the case of the cremation ground to the Hindu Council,” Dr Vankwani said, adding, “we will not only build the boundary wall but also get the design of the building prepared from an architect”.
Senior officials of the Hindu Panchayat had even turned down a request for a meeting from the commissioner, who is also the CDA chairman, an official from the civic authority claimed.
“The meeting with the officials will be decided by the Panchayat as we need to finalise the contents before the meeting with the CDA and Islamabad administration,” IHP President Muhesh Chaudhry said, after almost one week after the request for the meeting was forwarded to the Panchayat.
National Commission for Minorities Chairman Chela Ram Chairman said: “It (IHP) never tried to get in touch with the commission nor did they respond to any of our attempts to hold a meeting.”
The plot for the cremation ground was allotted to the IHP by the PML-N government in 2017 and handed over to the community in 2018. 
In 2020, they tried to build the boundary wall, but work was interrupted by local clerics who even approached the IHC seeking cancellation of the plot.
The court referred the matter to the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) which decided that a crematorium was the right of the Hindu community.
The IHC later directed the CDA to grant NOC to the Hindu Panchayat to build the boundary wall and allow construction of the main structure after the building map was approved.
Incidentally, due to a lacklustre attitude of the Panchayat, permission was first issued in the name of a Muslim activist who had been pursuing the case in December 2020, but later it was corrected and re-issued in the name of Pritum Das.
PML-N MNA and a member of the Parliamentary Committee against Forced Conversion Kesoo Mal Kheeal Das said the members of the Islamabad Panchayat were only interested in social media activism.
“I tried to meet them but they never responded back,” he said.
According to the Panchayat, there are around 300 Hindu families living in Islamabad, most of them had migrated to the city in the last decade. 
They belong to diversified professions, some having shops in various sectors while others were doctors and in government and private service.

4,Protesting I-12 allottees demand possession of plots,ISLAMABAD: Upset over an inordinate delay in the issuance of possession letters of their plots they had been ...,"ISLAMABAD: Upset over an inordinate delay in the issuance of possession letters of their plots they had been allotted over three decades ago, the allottees of I-12 staged a protest in front of the National Press Club (NPC).
Holding placards and raising slogans against the Capital Development Authority (CDA) administration, the allottees demanded action against the civic agency for not issuing possession letters to them. They also held a press conference at the NPC. 
Tahir Mahmood, a plot owner in I-12, said: “They had been allotted plots some 30 years ago but neither have we been issued possession letters not there is any hope that the civic agency will issue the letters in the near future.”
He said they had lodged several complaints with the CDA, but to no avail.
“Moreover, the slum dwellers have encroached upon I-12/3 which has become a safe haven for criminals.
They are now extending their encroachments to I-12/2 and I-12/4 but the CDA is doing nothing for the retrieval of their lands,” he said.
Khumar Gul, who is going to retire from government service in a couple of years, said: “I have invested my hard-earned money to buy a plot in I-12 to spend the rest of my life in my own home but development work has not been completed even after 30 years.”
Fahad Hameed, another plot owner, said: “In response to complaints filed by the allottees in the office of Wafaqi Mohtasib, CDA gave an undertaking on Feb 7, 2019 that development work will be completed in two years but it has still not begun.
Moreover, garbage of the entire federal capital is being dumped illegally in I-12 without any NOC from the relevant environment protection agencies.
Aftab Ahmed, another allottee said CDA earned billions of rupees by establishing cattle market on the land of allottees on Eidul Azha, which was unfair.
“We are living in rented houses and forced to pay the high monthly rent. So the amount the CDA earns from the cattle market should be given to us so that we can pay our monthly rent,” he added.
The allottees sought the prime minister’s intervention, and urged him to direct starting of development work in I-12.

5,Electric vehicle policy to reduce air pollution by over 40pc: PM’s aide,TAXILA: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam has said Pakistan’s ...,"TAXILA: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam has said Pakistan’s first ever electric vehicle policy introduced by the PTI government would achieve climate related goals besides helping in reducing air pollution by over 43pc.
He expressed these views while inaugurating work on the construction of a new road in Awanabad village of Tajik union council on Saturday. 
The project would be completed at a cost of Rs8 million during the current fiscal year.
Mr Aslam said with 43pc of the airborne emissions in the country coming from the transport sector, transition to electric vehicles would provide a huge opportunity to reduce air pollution.
He said the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Plantation and clean energy projects were acknowledged during the UN-led global climate summit (COP26).
He said Pakistan was awarded with Forestry Champion by the UN and Nature Leader award by UK at the summit.
He said though there were issues including inflation in Pakistan but it was also a fact that the PTI government under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan was taking practical steps to rid the nation of these problems.
“There are dozens of government’s programmes including Ehsaas Programme, Kamyab Jawan Programme, Insaf Health Card, and Ehsaas Scholarship through which efforts are being made to eradicate poverty and unemployment and people are also getting relief,” he added.
He said the government was striving hard to resolve public issues on a priority. Development projects have been initiated by the government to facilitate the masses. There is inflation not only in Pakistan but across the world and it would be controlled soon. 
He urged the masses to get themselves registered with Ehsaas Programme to get relief. 
He said heavy debt, corruption and expensive electricity contracts given by previous governments were one of the major causes of inflation.
Mr Aslam said work on the construction of 12-km-long Bhatiot Boota road had been started which will directly benefit thousands of residents of Attock and seven villages of Jand. 
He said the road project which was put on the back burner for many years was launched in a bid to provide better traveling facilities to the local people. It will reduce the distance of these villages from the Attock district headquarters by 40km.
He said at present the residents of these villages have to cover 80 to 100 km distance to reach Attock but after the completion of the road the distance will reduce by up to 50pc.
Mr Aslam said the road will also benefit other areas of Jand and Pindigheb besides generating economic activities.
He said steps were being taken to meet the paucity of teachers at Government Shuja Khanzada Shaheed College Hazro. Besides, work was being carried out on a water supply scheme for the area at a cost of Rs2.5 million.

Talking to media persons in Rawalpindi on Saturday, he said free, fair and transparent elections would help strengthen the democracy.
Expressing regret over the opposition parties’ stance regarding the legislation, Ghulam Sarwar said the government had time and again asked the opposition parties to give suggestions on the electoral reforms.
He said the opposition had the right to bring a no-confidence motion against the government. 
“The PDM is a bunch of losers. We are not afraid of them. The real problem for the government is inflation,” he said.
The minister said the opposition parties in Pakistan Democratic Movement were responsible for expensive electricity. “We are now responsible for this inflation which we are controlling,” he said.
He said as many as Rs130 billion has been allocated for targeted subsidy.
He questioned that why did Rana Shamim’s conscience not awaken before? 
The minister claimed that the 2018 elections were much better than previous ones.
Talking about electronic voting machine (EVM), he said that he was not technically familiar with EVM but the Supreme Court had the right to see that law made in the Parliament was constitutional or not.
“We have made legislation, it is their responsibility to work on it, if democracy is to be kept alive then elections have to be made compatible and transparent with modern requirements,” he said.
He said they gave right to vote to overseas Pakistani as per PTI manifesto. He said overseas Pakistanis played a vital role in Pakistan’s economy as total exports of the country was 28 billion dollars per annum and overseas Pakistanis sent more than 30 billion dollars in the country.
He said opposition should give suggestions to improve the electronic voting machine.
He said he also raised his voice against Kulbhushan Jadhav when he was arrested but the then PML-N government did not bring the issue in the Parliament because of the relationship between Nawaz Sharif and Modi.
He said the government and its allies have proved that they were united on national issues. 
He said that the counting was not recognised in the parliament by opposition but we had 223 numerical strength in the Senate and the National Assembly and 221 votes were cast, two could not come.

8,"Sanitation workers left underpaid, unprotected in pandemic: report","WaterAid findings show sanitation workers are often marginalised, stigmatised and shunned in Pakistan...","ISLAMABAD: During the pandemic, sanitation workers had been praised as ‘Covid warriors’ in some nations but WaterAid has found many of these workers in developing countries, including Pakistan, have been forgotten, underpaid, unprotected and left to fend for themselves.
Research carried out by WaterAid at the start of the pandemic on the safety and wellbeing of those who cleared and disposed of fecal waste revealed hazardous working conditions, a dangerous lack of personnel protection equipment, poor training as well as loss of income for millions.
According to the research published by WaterAid, Pakistan related findings of the report released ahead of World Toilet Day on November 19 showed that half of the sanitation workers who were interviewed faced challenges in meeting their daily expenses. Similarly, only half of the sanitation workers were able to access the social security measures introduced by the government.

WaterAid findings show sanitation workers are often marginalised, stigmatised and shunned in Pakistan

The report said sanitation workers included people who cleaned toilets and sewers, emptied latrine pits and septic tanks and operated pumping stations and treatment plants as well as those who cleared fecal waste manually, swept rubbish and transported fecal sludge. 
Despite providing a vital service of ensuring human waste was cleared, stored and disposed of safely, the sanitation workers were often marginalised, stigmatised and shunned as a result of their job. “Many have worked on the frontline of the pandemic throughout national lockdowns in hospitals and quarantine centres and in the heart of communities with poor access to safe water, decent sanitation and good hygiene facilities.
Tasleem Mai, 50, from Muzzafargarh, whose case study was part of the report, provided for her family of 12 and had been a sanitary worker for 25 years. She took on the job since there was no other work opportunity available. She rarely received or used any protective equipment despite the risks of infection or accidents. The study also said she knew the importance of her role but said: “We [sanitary workers] always have to compromise our dignity and personal wellbeing to do the job. We are an integral part of society, performing a vital role but we are not paid for overtime or leave, and we have no medical check-ups or testing, with or without the pandemic.”
Many sanitation workers told WaterAid they felt forced to go to work during lockdowns even if they felt ill for fear of losing their jobs. Even without the threat of the virus, sanitation work was hazardous. The workforce risk being exposed to a wide variety of health hazards and diseases and could often come in direct contact with human waste. Sharp objects in latrines and poor construction could cause injury and infection while toxic gases made workers lose consciousness and/or even their lives, the study found.
According to media reports, on October 3-4, two sanitation workers - Nadeem Masih, 38, and Faisal Masih, 28, - died due to toxic gases while performing their duties in manholes of Sargodha without safety gear. Similar cases were reported frequently from different parts of Pakistan.
“However, these incidents neither result in better working conditions for sanitation workers nor do their families get any compensation.”
Arif Jabbar Khan, WaterAid Pakistan Country Director, said: “Sanitation workers play vital role in keeping our neighbourhoods clean but they face social and economic exclusion and discrimination based on their profession. Many sanitation workers lose their lives while performing duties under unsafe health and safety conditions.”

9,PFUJ objects to some clauses of journalists protection law,"“These are thin lines that are placed in such laws that could be used against any individual or organisation,"" PFUJ official says.","ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) on Saturday said some clauses of the Protection of Journalists (PFUJ) and Media Professionals Act 2021 could be used to frame a mediaperson in a false case and that should have been avoided.
The bill was approved by the National Assembly on Nov 8 and the Senate on Friday.
The treasury side approved the bill without forwarding it to the relevant standing committee.
Later, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain congratulated working journalists over the passage of the bill in a tweet saying: “The law would, for the first time, give working journalists the same rights the journalist community enjoyed in highly developed societies.”
Meanwhile, PFUJ secretary general Nasir Zaidi said Clause 6 (3) of the Act could be used by any government to frame journalists and it should have been amended.
“These are thin lines that are always placed in such laws that could be used against any individual or organisation,” Mr Zaidi added.
Clause 6 of the Act states: “All journalists and media professionals must respect the rights and reputation of others and not produce material that advocates national, racial, ethnical, religious, sectarian, linguistic, cultural or gender based hatred which may constitute incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence.”
Mr Zaidi said these restrictions were also present in other laws and such a connotation in the Act could have been avoided if it would have been finalised after consultation in the Senate standing committee.
Under the Act, the government will establish a 16-member independent commission for the protection of journalists and media professional which will include 12 working journalists to be nominated by journalists’ bodies.
The Act highlights that the government will ensure that journalists and media professionals are allowed to carry out their journalistic work in conflict areas. 
The government will ensure that effective measures are taken to protect journalists and media professionals from forced or involuntary disappearances, kidnapping, abduction or other methods of coercion.
It also grants rights to privacy and non-disclosure of sources, and states that the government shall ensure that no person, officer, agency or institution unlawfully or arbitrarily interfere with the rights to privacy of any journalist and his/her family.
The Act says that the “government shall make efforts to safeguard confidentiality of the sources of a journalist. The Act also has provisions for independence for mediapersons in the performance of their duties.

12,Right to use of force should only rest with the state: experts,"Say ensuring rule of law, civic education, equality of citizens and youth vital to end extremism, terrorism.","ISLAMABAD: The right to use of force should only rest with the state and ensuring rule of law, civic education, equality of citizens and youth and women’s engagement are vital to end extremism and terrorism in the country.
These views were expressed by experts in a two-day regional consultation on ‘Promoting soft approaches in countering terrorism and extremism in Pakistan’ organised by Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) at a local hotel.
The event was aimed at seeking input from experts to formulate a charter of peace, which, with the support and endorsement of key stakeholders would be pursued for realising the goal of sustainable peace in the country.
Besides others, journalists, religious scholars, academics, rights activists, former military officials, representatives of civil society and law enforcement agencies attended the event and took part in different sessions.

Say ensuring rule of law, civic education, equality of citizens and youth vital to end extremism, terrorism

PIPS Director Mohammad Amir Rana and Project Manager of the institute Najamuddin were the moderators.
The speakers underlined that students of mainstream schools and colleges were as vulnerable to radicalisation as those from seminaries and needed to be engaged by creating spaces for them at different platforms including activation of local bodies. They emphasised the need to engage peaceful youth movements that stood for human rights and democratic values.
They said these were the basic ingredients of a much needed charter of peace in the country.
The state, the political parties and parliament should move forward to give a counter narrative on extremism and terrorism and realise their responsibilities and ensure civic education and constitutional literacy to promote tolerance and equality for all citizens in society.
The participants were of the view that whatever space was available to political parties must be used to give counter narratives on extremism and they should engage the youth.
Dr Zafar Nawaz Jaspal of the Quaid-i-Azam University said that there were no tangible initiatives to de-radicalise society. He also said the government reaching an agreement with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) would only have a “tactical but no strategic outcome in future.”
He cautioned that there should be a proper strategy to deal with “re-radicalisation”.
Former Corps Commander Peshawar retired Lt-Gen Masood Aslam in a panel discussion said hard approaches always created spaces for reliance on soft approaches but such opportunities had seldom been availed. He said the state and the government should give equal opportunities to citizens, including that of employment, to end extremism.
Former National Security Adviser retired Lt-Gen Nasir Khan Janjua was of the view that there was a need to redefine war on terrorism and soft approaches should be adopted.
“Prevent misuse of religion and that will dry down the militancy,” he said, urging a people-centric approach and introduction and implementation of madressah reforms.
He also said that a new counter-terrorism and counter-violent extremism (CVE) framework should be formed and parliament should play a key role to end extremism.
Former ambassador Qazi Humayun was of the view that the West would not accept Taliban government in Kabul and this would have blowback impact on Pakistan with rise in terrorism.
DSP Zarina Anjum, in-charge of CVE Section of Punjab’s Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), said that anti-radicalisation and counter-radicalisation were the two basic steps that should be prioritised ahead of de-radicalisation. DSP Shafqat Rasheed, another officer of CTD Punjab, in his remarks said that there was a need to de-radicalise those terrorists who were languishing in jails by engaging their families and childhood friends.
Senior journalist and columnist Wusatullah Khan said the use of force should only be the domain of the state.
Renowned economist Dr Kaiser Bengali said equal distribution of resources and wealth was necessary for “economy of peace”.
Journalist and rights activist Wajahat Masood emphasised the need for giving due rights to minorities.
“The way we have treated our minorities is a recipe of extremism,” he said.
PIPS Director Mohammad Amir Rana in his welcome note highlighted the need to improve the counter-narrative paradigm and said that mere absence of armed conflict alone does not amount to peace.

The minister announced this through his social media account on Twitter hours after former Fafen secretary general Sarwar Bari held a news conference in Islamabad and levelled serious allegations against Fafen over its working and funding.
Mr Chaudhry said he had directed the FIA to also initiate legal action on the matter after investigaitons.
On the other hand, Fafen’s executive council in a statement rejected the allegations raised by Mr Bari terming them “baseless and part of a malicious smear campaign” by one of its former members, who was expelled from the network for “misconduct” a few days ago.

Fafen terms allegations ‘baseless’; welcomes inquiry, audit

“Fafen, which receives administrative, financial and technical support from the Trust for Democratic Education and Accountability (TDEA), has always upheld transparency in its working and is open for any type of scrutiny, inquiry and audit of its data, reports, finances and decision-making,” says the statement.
Mr Bari alleged that the Fafen’s report on the 2013 general elections was based on “fudged data” and it had been prepared by one of its former chiefs in a “closed room”.
Quoting one of the former employees of TDEA, Mr Bari said after failing to get the data and the reports from a number of election observers due to the fault in the communication system developed by TDEA, the then executive director of the TDEA allegedly hatched a conspiracy and entered fake data. He alleged that TDEA had tampered some of the observers’ reports. He also alleged that some of the IT experts had resigned from the organisation over this “immoral” activity and some of them were paid for keeping their mouth shut.
Fafen in its statement termed the insinuations raised by Mr Bari “mala fide” that were only meant to damage the integrity, credibility and unity of Pakistan’s largest non-partisan network of civil society organisations.
Mr Bari’s accusations followed his and his organisation’s termination from the basic membership of Fafen a few days ago after he failed to provide any evidence to substantiate similar claims and his campaign against the network that he had been running since October.
