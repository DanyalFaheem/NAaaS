0,"Supporting Afghan Taliban may be counterproductive, seminar told",Director of Afghanistan's Tolo News says the Taliban and the world need to talk about the future.,"LAHORE: The more Pakistan favours the Afghan Taliban, the more strengthened the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) and other such groups become. And Pakistan’s support to the Kabul regime does not help the Afghan people in any way.  
Speakers stated this without mincing words at a session, titled “Chaos in Afghanis­tan and Talking to Banned Organisations”, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Saturday.  
The context of the ongoing talks between Islamabad and the TTP and a deal recently reached with the TLP attracted an enthusiastic crowd to the session. The audience was interested to learn about the experience of Afghans during their talks with the Taliban in Doha.  
Moderator Ahmed Rashid opened the discussion with news that Pakistan had refused visas to some Afghans who had been invited to the conference as participants and panellists. The panel included Nader Nadery (member of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan’s peace negotiation team); Abdullah Khenjani, Afghanistan’s former deputy minister; and Lotfullah Najafizada (director of Afghanistan’s Tolo News). They were able to participate in the conference because they had obtained visas prior to the fall of Kabul in August.  

Speaker says Afghanistan is the only country without a law, and a proper system of governance

Former senator Afrasiab Khattak, MNA Mohsin Dawar and Samina Ahmed (project director for South Asia and senior Asia adviser at the International Crisis Group) were also on the panel.  
Mr Najafizada blamed a “collective failure” for what happened recently in Afghanistan. In a very calculated tone, he said the Taliban and the world needed to talk about the future, instead of the failure of previous governments.  
He said the Taliban needed to understand that they were ruling an Afghanistan that’s different from that of 2001. As Afghans are now more connected, the Taliban should show maturity and learn to agree to disagree and that hatred for the US could not put food on the table.  
He was optimistic about the Afghans’ abilities and said the country could go in any direction in the post-America era.  
Mr Nadery recalled flaws in the Doha peace talks and came up with four factors for the ongoing chaos in Afghanistan: the US policy to get out of the country was flawed; talks were simply a PR exercise where the Taliban had no intention of reaching any settlement; the Ghani government’s failure to build institutions; and Pakistan’s emphasis on defeating Indian policies in the neighbouring country rather than in serving the interests of Afghans.  
The Afghan regime should adopt a political system to be able to become a part of the “mainstream world” and Pakistan must push the Kabul authorities to do so.  
Mr Khenjani said the Taliban were trying to hold the Afghans hostage in order to pressure the world to grant them acceptance. Instead, he said, they should realise they were the rulers of Afghanistan and should focus on delivery.  
Mr Khattak said the Taliban knew how to reward their commanders but not how to work for the people. He said Afghanistan was the only country without a law, and a proper government system, and the only country to be called a fenced prison after Pakistan installed barbed wires on its western borders.  
He said that issues in Afghan policy were being decided by someone other than the prime minister. Pakistan needed to stop supporting the Afghan Taliban if it wanted to defeat the TTP.  
He was of the opinion that Afghan Taliban and the TTP were two sides of the same coin. Similarly, the TLP and TTP had the common agenda of “political Islam”, which made them allies.  
MNA Dawar condemned the refusal to grant visas to Afghan invitees, and said Pakistan was open to people like [acting Afghan Foreign Minister Amir] Muttaqi, but not to the real Afghans. He said all those who played a role in the collapse of the previous Afghan government would soon regret their decision.

1,"Thousands rally against Covid curbs in Austria, Australia",Europe is battling a fresh wave of infections and several countries have tightened curbs.,"VIENNA: Thousands took to the streets in Austria and Australia on Saturday as anger mounted over new Covid restrictions imposed to tackle a resurgent pandemic, sparking overnight riots in a Dutch city and a French island. 
Europe is battling a fresh wave of infections and several countries have tightened curbs, with Austria on Friday announcing a national partial lockdown — the most dramatic restrictions in Western Europe for months. 
Other nations on the continent have resorted to less severe restrictions, often choosing to ban unvaccinated people from venues like restaurants and bars. 
Some 10,000 people marched in Sydney and there were protests in other major Australian cities against vaccine mandates, which are not universal and have only been applied to certain occupations by state authorities. 
“In Australia where a fanatical cult runs our health bureaucracies, they say it’s ok (to vaccinate children),” right-wing politician Craig Kelly told the Sydney crowd to large cheers. 
Violence marred protests on Friday in the Dutch port city of Rotterdam where police fired warning shots as protesters set fires. Two people were hospitalised with bullet wounds. 
There was also arson and looting overnight in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe where a night curfew has been imposed. 
Thousands gathered on Saturday in central Vienna near the Chancellery, responding to a call by the far right FPO party, to denounce the new measures. 
They held up banners decrying “Corona dictatorship” and slamming the “division of society”. 
“It’s not normal that the government deprives us of our rights,” said 42-year-old Katarina Gierscher, who travelled for six hours to get to the rally. 
“The government wants to divide us. We must remain united.” 
From Monday, 8.9 million Austrians will not be allowed to leave home except to go to work, shop for essentials and exercise. The restrictions will initially last 20 days with an evaluation after 10 days. 
Vaccination against Covid-19 in the Alpine nation will be mandatory from February 1 next year. 
Organisers cancelled a Dutch protest on Saturday but a few hundred people still gathered in Amsterdam and a similar number marched through the southern city of Breda.

2,Britain moves to ban Hamas as ‘terrorist organisation’,Parliament will vote on the proposals next week and a ban could become effective from Friday...,"LONDON: Showing support for Hamas in Britain could be punished with 14 years in prison if the government succeeds in banning the group as a “terrorist organisation”, the Home Office said on Friday. 
Home Secretary Priti Patel announced the move to bring Britain into line with the United States, which designated Hamas a “terrorist group” in 1995, and the European Union. 
Parliament will vote on the proposals next week and if successful, could become effective from next Friday. 
Patel argued an outright ban under the Terrorism Act 2000 was necessary because it was not possible to distinguish between Hamas’ political and military wings. 
The al-Qassam Brigades military wing of the Islamist movement that rules the Gaza Strip has been banned in Britain since March 2001. 

Parliament will vote on the proposals next week and a ban could become effective from Friday

“Hamas commits, participates, prepares for and promotes and encourages terrorism,” alleged Patel. 
On a trip to Washington, she earlier called Hamas “fundamentally and… anti-Semitic”, adding that proscription was required to protect the Jewish community. 
Israel’s Prime Minister Naftali Bennett applauded the news, calling Hamas “a radical Islamic group that targets innocent Israelis and seeks Israel’s destruction”. 
“I welcome the UK’s intention to declare Hamas a ‘terrorist organisation’ in its entirety — because that’s exactly what it is,” he claimed in a tweet. 
Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said the move was a result of “joint efforts” between the British and Israeli governments. 
Hamas’ reaction
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the move was a crime against “our Palestinian people and all their history of struggle, as well as a condemnation of the legitimate struggles of all free peoples against colonialism”. 
Qassem said the decision, if approved by parliament, would be “a great political, moral and legal sin committed by Britain” that only favoured Israel. 
The proposals would see the outlawing of flying Hamas’ flag, arranging to meet its members or wearing clothing supporting the group. 
Politically, it could force Britain’s Labour party to take a position on Hamas, given the strong pro-Palestinian support on the left of the main opposition party. 
Earlier this month, a man appeared in court for wearing T-shirts supporting Hamas’ military wing and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which was banned in Britain in 2005. 
On three occasions in June, Feras Al Jayoosi, 34, wore the garments in the Golders Green area of north London, which has a large Jewish population.

3,All options open if diplomacy fails to halt Iran’s N-plans: US,Pentagon chief rebuts claims Washington has become reluctant to use force.,"MANAMA: The United States warned on Saturday it was capable of deploying “overwhelming force” in the Middle East as it faced questions about its willingness to use its military power in the region. 
Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin told the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain’s capital that all options would be open if diplomacy fails to halt Iran’s nuclear programme, but he was also forced to rebut claims the US has become reluctant to use force. 
The Pentagon chief was asked why Washington did not respond to last month’s drone-and-artillery attack on a base used by the US-led coalition fighting the militant Islamic State (IS) group in Syria. 
“The United States of America maintains the right to defend itself. And we will defend ourselves and our interests, no matter what, at the time and place of our choosing,” he replied. 

Pentagon chief rebuts claims Washington has become reluctant to use force

“And let no country, let no individual be mistaken about that. We are committed to defending ourselves and our interests and that includes our partners as well,” said Austin. 
“And we’re also committed to not allowing Iran to get a nuclear weapon.” 
Iran and world powers are set for talks on November 29 aimed at reviving an accord that placed restrictions on its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. Tehran has always denied it is seeking nuclear weapons. 
Austin said Washington’s major goal was to strengthen its “unmatched” alliances in the Middle East, but said military force remained an option with tens of thousands of its troops stationed in the region. 
After ending its 20-year occupation of Afghanistan in August, the US is poised to withdraw its combat troops from Iraq by the end of the year. 
This month, Iraq’s prime minister escaped an assassination attempt two days after security forces clashed with supporters of Iran-backed parties that lost support in recent elections. 
On Saturday, Iran said it had seized a foreign boat smuggling diesel in the oil-rich Gulf. 
Since February, Iran and Israel have been engaged in a “shadow war” in which vessels linked to each country have come under attack in waters around the Gulf. 
The US and Israel accuse Iran of using drones and missiles to destabilise the region. 
In brief remarks to the forum, senior Saudi figure Turki bin Faisal Al Saud called for “demonstrative action” in the region, including the “total enforcement” of the arms embargo on Yemen’s Iran-supported Houthi rebels, who are fighting a Saudi-led coalition. 
Austin said that “America’s commitment to security in the Middle East is strong and sure”.  
“Ultimately, our mission is to support diplomacy and to deter conflict and to defend the United States and our vital interests,” he said. “If we’re forced to turn back aggression, we will win and we will win decisively.”  Austin’s visit comes days before Iran returns to talks with world powers on resuming a nuclear deal which has been stalled since 2018, when former US president Donald Trump walked away. 
On Friday, US special envoy Robert Malley told the conference that time was running out to return to the deal if Iran continues to make “advances” in its nuclear programme. 
“We remain committed to a diplomatic outcome of the nuclear issue,” Austin said. “But if Iran is not willing to engage seriously, then we will look at all the options necessary to keep them the United States secure.”
