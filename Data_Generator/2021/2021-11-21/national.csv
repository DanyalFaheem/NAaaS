0,120m doses of Covid-19 vaccine administered so far,Covid-19 vaccine administration for children between 12-15 years will remain suspended till Nov 27.,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has achieved another milestone of administering 120 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine. 
According to the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), 120,­448,598 doses of vaccine have been administered since the vaccination drive began in the country in February this year. 
It said on Saturday that 78,845,170 people have received at least one dose of vaccine and 49,010,906 others have become fully vaccinated. 
The NCOC said in a tweet that due to ongoing national MR [measles rubella] campaign (Nov 15-27), Covid-19 vaccine administration for children between 12-15 years will remain suspended till Nov 27. 

 



 
It said another 319 people were infected and seven others succumbed to the virus in the last 24 hours, while national positivity remained at 0.81 per cent. 
The NCOC claimed that the number of active cases was 22,479 and 1,117 patients were admitted to hospitals as of Nov 20. 
Spokesperson for the Ministry of National Health Services Sajid Shah told Dawn that it was a major achievement that over 120m doses of vaccine have been administered. 
“Although the pace of the vaccination has been slowed down due to the decision that children from 12 to 15 will not be vaccinated, we are hopeful that the number of vaccinations will again increase from Nov 29,” he said. 
Mr Shah said that the ministry was trying to make sure that 70m vaccine eligible people would be inoculated before the end of this calendar year. 
“We have ample quantity of vaccines and more vaccines will arrive in a few months through the international alliance Covax, which has pledged to provide free vaccines for 20pc population, and through procurement,” he said. 
He said as per the federal cabinet’s directives, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) has issued a code of conduct for health professionals and pharmaceutical companies. 
“Now pharmaceutical companies cannot pay cash amounts or provide incentives to doctors and strict action would be taken in case of violations. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies will not be allowed to pay for the travel expenses of doctors and their family members. They have been made bound to provide details of expenditure on scientific and educational conferences and even during those conferences companies will not be able to spend unnecessary amounts,” he said. 
An official of Drap said that pharmaceutical companies should also be stopped from arranging inspection visits of the Authority’s officers. 
“As Drap registers medicines after visiting the manufacturing units of pharmaceutical companies, and inspects the units, a number of multinational pharmaceutical companies pay for the inspection visits of Drap officers to different countries. This practice should be stopped as it is a perfect example of conflict of interest,” he said.

2,PTI senator meets TLP’s Saad Rizvi,LAHORE: Pakistan Tehr­­eek-i-Insaf (PTI) Sen­ator Ejaz Chaudhry on Saturday visited Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan...,"LAHORE: Pakistan Tehr­­eek-i-Insaf (PTI) Sen­ator Ejaz Chaudhry on Saturday visited Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Hafiz Saad Rizvi to congratulate him on his release after seven-month detention. 
Hafiz Rizvi was released from Kot Lakhpat jail on Thursday after reaching an agreement with the government. The government and TLP reached an agreement after many rounds of talks and two weeks of clashes which left seven policemen and an unspecified number of TLP workers dead. 
However, the contents of the agreement have not yet been publicly shared. 
Senator Chaudhry first paid homage at the shrine of Allama Khadim Rizvi on his first death anniversary and later held a meeting with TLP chief Hafiz Rizvi. He also presented him with a bouquet and congratulated him on his release. 
A TLP spokesperson said that the political discourse needed to continue and the door for politics was never closed. 
Mr Chaudhry said he had visited Hafiz Rizvi because he had promised to present him a bouquet on his release. 
Earlier, speaking in a private news channel programme, Mr Chaudhry said: “I will present a bouquet to Saad Rizvi when he is released.” He also spoke about forming a coalition with TLP in future elections on the TV channel. 
He said he came to meet Rizvi as a gesture of goodwill and it was the responsibility of the government to stay in contact with leaders who were different from others. “It is the responsibility of the state to build such ties with the people that create an atmosphere of harmony,” Mr Chaudhry said. 
He said TLP had a different past as compared to other political parties and the state should keep liaison with the masses to eliminate misunderstandings and ensure peace. 
When the government and TLP had inked the agreement, Mr Chaudhry said he wanted that the agreement should be executed in letter and spirit that eventually happened with the release of Hafiz Rizvi. 
He said TLP had a different past as it never remained in power. He hoped that the party would play its positive role in the political canvas of the country. 
Answering a question, Mr Chaudhry said he had never met any political party leader without the permission of Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
It may be mentioned that Mr Chaudhry had stated that PTI would support TLP candidates, if his party’s candidate Jamshed Iqbal Cheema was disqualified by the Lahore High Court. 
However, PTI’s support to TLP subsided as the latter did not field its candidate in the NA-133 by-election scheduled for Dec 5.

5,Cities’ contribution to GDP remains only 55pc: FPCCI,KARACHI: Pakistan’s cities contribute only 55 per cent to gross domestic product as compared to the world’s...,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s cities contribute only 55 per cent to gross domestic product as compared to the world’s average of 80pc, the president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) said on Saturday.  
A lack of investment in infrastructure is making Pakistan’s cities lag behind in economic and commercial growth, Mian Nasser Hyatt Maggo said in a statement.  
He attributed this phenomenon to the absence of urban planning through a master plan, which has resulted in poor transportation networks, abysmal health and educational facilities, insufficient provision of basic utilities like water, sanitation, gas and electricity, underdeveloped industrial areas, etc. Apart from the current provincial and federal governments, previous governments have also been negligent in this regard, he said.
