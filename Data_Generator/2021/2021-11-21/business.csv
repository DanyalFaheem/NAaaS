0,"Govt commits cheaper RLNG to Karachi exporters in winter, says Bilwani",The energy ministry has not issued any official statement on the agreement so far.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government and the value-added textile sector have reached an agreement over uninterrupted supply of regasified-liquefied natural gas (RLNG) at a preferential rate to the export industry from December for the next three months. 
The export industry has held out an assurance to the Ministry of Energy to buy RLNG at $9 per mmBtu for captive power plants and $6.5 per mmBtu for their boilers, Pakistan Apparel Forum chairman Jawed Bilwani told Dawn on telephone from Karachi.
He said the understanding was reached in a virtual meeting held on Friday with Energy Minister Hammad Azhar. However, the energy ministry has not issued any official statement on the agreement so far.
Taking to the social media platform on Friday, Hammad Azhar in a tweet  said, “A successful meeting held with export sectors of all provinces.  They have been assured of stable gas supply during winters and in return  inefficient gas captive plants will shift to power now.” 

 



 
Mr Bilwani said that a number of value-added exporters of Karachi have only RLNG connections and the Sui Southern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SSGPL) is charging $15.62 per mmBtu and even on this excessive tariff the required gas pressure is not available in the pipeline.
“Even at this high rate there are also gas outages of approximately 12 hours on a daily basis during daytime,” he deplored.
Keeping this high rate and outages, Mr Bilwani termed the deal a better one in the prevailing circumstances.  “The textile exporters are fully aware of the gas shortage during the winter season and admire the government support for the export industry”, he added.
Mr Bilwani said the value-added textile industry will pay the agreed rate provided the ministry ensures uninterrupted gas supply with required pressure. He also pointed out that there is a disparity in rates of RLNG across provinces. 
He said Karachi-based textile exporters were deprived of concessional RLNG tariff of $6.5 per mmBtu all-inclusive or $9 per mmBtu all-inclusive provided to industries in Punjab despite fact that export industries in Karachi have a share of over 54pc in total exports from the country.
He said exporters of Karachi also demand similar concessional rates of RLNG.
Mr Bilwani suggested to the ministry of energy to play its role in the national interest by assuring and taking all necessary steps and measures to provide gas to the export-oriented industries in compliance with the sitting government’s policy for export enhancement so that exports of  Pakistan must not suffer and the wheels of export industries must smoothly run during the quarter of winter season to ultimately more valuable foreign exchange for Pakistan.
According to Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data, the exports of textile and clothing posted a growth of 26.55pc in 4MFY22 to $6.02bn compared to $4.75bn over the year. 
In the value-added textile sector, the export of ready-made garments jumped by 22.34pc in value and in quantity by 20.50pc in July-October 2021-22, while those of knitwear edged up 35.45pc in value, but dipped 13.11pc in quantity, bedwear posted positive growth of 21.30pc in value and 23.53pc in quantity.
Towel exports were up by 14.17pc in value and 7.75pc in quantity, whereas those of cotton cloth rose by 18.54pc in value and dipped by 76.83pc in quantity.

1,"State Bank, FIA join hands against money laundering, cyberattacks","Central bank governor emphasises need to investigate white-collar crimes, apprehend and prosecute fraudsters.","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Federal Inve­stigation Agency (FIA) will strengthen coordination against money laundering, digital frauds and cyberattacks, it was decided on Saturday.  
The central bank governor while chairing a meeting emphasised the need for close cooperation among banks, SBP and FIA to expeditiously investigate white-collar crimes and apprehend and prosecute the fraudsters. 
The meeting was attended by FIA Director General Sanaullah Abbasi, bank presidents and senior SBP and FIA officials. Pakistan has been actively trying to fix its financial monitoring mechanism, especially since the country’s inclusion in the grey list of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) three years ago. 
FATF placed Pakistan on its grey list of countries with inadequate controls over terrorism financing in 2018, which made foreign firms more cautious about investing in Pakistan.  

Accord on fast-paced probe into white-collar crimes

The country has been trying hard to come out of the list but it has been unable to convince the watchdogs closely monitoring the country’s financial transactions.  
In its latest announcement on Oct 21, FATF announced that Pakistan will remain on its grey list.  
Announcing the decision, FATF President Dr Marcus Pleyer said that Pakistan had to complete two concurrent action plans with a total of 34 items. The country has so far addressed or largely addressed 30 items.  
The State Bank said it has taken several measures in the recent past to strengthen its work on anti-money laundering as well as taken regulatory and supervisory measures to improve banks’ controls to prevent digital and social engineering frauds.  
“In addition to better controls at the level of Financial Institutions and enhanced customers’ awareness, effective investigation and prosecution of criminals is needed to substantially reduce incidences of money laundering, digital frauds and cyberattacks,” the SBP said.
Just last month, the National Bank of Pakistan faced a cyberattack that disrupted its payment system for a few days, exposing the increasing risk of digital threats for financial businesses. However, the bank reported no data or financial loss.  
The FIA team offered support in strengthening cyber security at banks and suggested that banks should carry out an information security audit of their systems. 
Welcoming the suggestion, the SBP informed the agency that as per existing regulations banks are required to regularly carry out their information system audit and penetration testing. However, this would be re-emphasised to the industry through Pakistan Banks Asso­ciation.
The meeting identified key follow-up areas and associated timelines for strengthening cooperation between SBP, FIA and banks in this regard.

2,"Punjab govt, flour millers lock horns amid strike call",The food department has accused millers of creating an issue out of nothing.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government and flour millers have locked horns over the wheat release policy and other issues, with the food department accusing millers of creating an issue out of nothing while the millers sticking to their plan to go on strike. 
The government maintains that the release policy is more of a routine matter and the millers are only creating an issue that they were not taken on board. “The food department was not preparing a release policy for the first time. It has been doing it for decades. Is it necessary to waste weeks on talks with millers when the market is deteriorating on a daily basis?” a food department official questioned.
On the other hand, flour millers have threatened to go on strike next week unless the provincial government accepted their demands, including equal quota for all millers, increasing grinding and transportation charges and ending forced supply of flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in red bags.
Ever since wheat release started in late September, the Punjab Food Department and flour millers seem to be in a difficult situation.
“This haste has left the issues of millers unattended,” explained Asim Raza, the chairman of Pakistan Flour Mills Association’s (PFMA) Punjab chapter. 
“Under the official quota per body/grinding machine fluctuates from 12 bags in South Punjab to 46 bags in Lahore. This is making operations commercially unviable. The association has been arguing with the department to increase the quota to at least 18 bags to make grinding commercially viable,” Mr Raza said.
“Since when did commercial viability of mills become the department’s obligation,” wondered the Food Department’s officials. 
“The department has to ensure flour supply to the people, not the millers. If someone has put up mills, say in the remotest region of Rajanpur, is it departmental duty to ensure profits for it. Certainly not!” the food department official maintained.
Meanwhile, Mr Raza pointed out other bigger issues. “For almost eight years, the government has not increased grinding charges which are stuck at Rs100 per 20kg bag,” the PFMA office bearer said. 
The Punjab Food Depa­rtment sprang another surprise this season when it asked the millers to supply flour to KP in red bags. “The department can certainly decide about flour supplies in Punjab, but why should it interfere in supplies to KP?” he said.
Meanwhile, PFMA patr­on-in-chief Mian Riaz, who presided over the fourth emergency meeting of the millers, said that daily harassment of flour millers on different issues was yet another problem which must end.
“The government is asking millers to lift 25 per cent of quota from other districts which now costs a fortune. All these troubles need to be removed. Flour millers are putting the government on a three-day notice after which the millers would stop lifting official wheat and go on strike. A decision for the strike would be taken on Tuesday,” Mr Riaz said.

However, positive sentiments overcame uncertainty later in the week with the government agreeing to pay Rs190 billion to independent power producers and leaving the petroleum prices unc­hanged for the next fortnight. 
But investors bec­ame nervous once again when the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) called an early meeting of monetary policy committee with analysts expecting a steep interest rate hike. 
The committee ann­ounced a hike of 150 basis points in the policy rate following the release of data of the current account deficit, which rose to $5.1 billion in the first four months of 2021-22 versus a surplus of $1.3bn a year ago.

Arif Habib Ltd said foreign selling continued throughout the week and amounted to $25 million versus a net sell of $5.3m in the preceding week. 
Major selling took place in commercial banking ($14.7m) and fertiliser ($4.7m). 
Locally, insurance companies reported buying of $13.5m while companies purchased shares worth $7.7m. The average volume clocked in at 245m shares, down 23pc from a week ago. The average value traded settled at $53m, down 17pc on a weekly basis. 
According to AKD Securities, investors’ sentiments are linked to the announcement of the IMF package. “Once through, the market is likely to post a rebound,” it added.

4,Number of microfinance borrowers soars to record 8.2m,"According to the latest data, as many as 161,318 customers joined the ranks of active borrowers in the third quarter of 2021.","KARACHI: The number of active microfinance borrowers increased 20 per cent year-on-year to an all-time high of 8.2 million at the end of the July-September quarter.
According to the latest data released by the Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN) — the national association for retail players in the microfinance industry — as many as 161,318 customers joined the ranks of active borrowers in the third quarter of 2021, up 2pc from the preceding three-month period.
Speaking to Dawn, Mobilink Microfinance Bank CEO Ghazanfar Azzam called the 20pc expansion in the number of borrowers “less than satisfactory” given the large size of the potential market.
PMN estimates that the microfinance outreach or penetration rate was 39.9pc at the end of September. This means six in every 10 potential customers in the country still can’t access microfinance.
“We’re at 8.2m borrowers in 20 years. Growing at this pace will take us another 25 years to reach every potential customer. I think we should grow 40-50pc a year consistently,” he said.
In the July-September quarter, the microfinance provider with the highest number of active borrowers was Mobilink Microfinance Bank (2m), followed by Khushhali Bank (838,789) and Akhuwat Islamic Microfinance (764,287).
The gross loan portfolio (GLP) amounted to Rs365 billion, up 2.8pc from a quarter ago and 18pc from a year ago. Khushhali Bank was the biggest player in terms of the GLP as its asset book had outstanding microcredit of Rs68.2bn. It was followed by First Microfinance Bank (Rs50.5bn) and Mobilink Microfinance Bank (Rs34.9bn).
The number of active savers increased to 72.5m, up 3.1pc from a quarter ago and 24pc from a year ago. The value of total savings grew to Rs384bn, up 1.4pc and 20pc on a quarterly and yearly basis, respectively.
Growth in the number of active savers was driven by Mobilink Microfinance Bank’s m-wallets, which increased by 1.8m during the period. The rise in savings was led by Ubank. M-wallets held 81pc of the total depositors with 14pc of the total value of deposits. The remaining 19pc of the depositors used traditional branch banking accounts with 86pc of the total deposits.
As for the number of active savers, Mobilink Microfinance Bank (37m) led the sector with Telenor Microfinance Bank (21.8m) and National Rural Support Programme (3m) trailing behind.
The average loan size grew from Rs17,320 to Rs23,846 on a quarterly basis as the number of loans disbursed decreased 29.1pc owing to the “seasonal variation”. Credit risk, indicated by the portfolio-at-risk or loans that have been outstanding for more than 30 days, increased from 5.2pc to 5.9pc.
This is despite the fact that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) had launched its debt relief scheme to help small borrowers of the microfinance sector survive Covid-19 that intensified in March 2020.
According to the SBP, major beneficiaries of its debt relief scheme were individual borrowers, especially the ones who had taken out loans from microfinance players. Microcredit providers “significantly supported” their 1.7m small borrowers by extending the repayments on loans of up to Rs121bn. SBP statistics show the approval rate for the applications from micro-borrowers requesting debt relief remained 98.9pc until the end of the scheme on March 31, 2021.
“The microfinance industry should aim to increase the market penetration rate from about 40pc to more than 50pc within a couple of years,” said Mr Azzam.

5,"Iron, scrap imports plunge 33pc in July-October","Steel bar prices have surged to Rs195,000 per tonne","KARACHI: The import of iron and steel scrap in quantity terms plunged by 33 per  cent in 4MFY22 to 1.227 million tonnes from 1.824m tonnes in the same  period last year. 
However, the total import value of scrap rose by 9 per cent to $704  million in  July-October period from $646m in the same period last   year, witnessing 55.6pc increase in average per tonne price to $551 from  $354 in 4MFY21, data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics   (PBS) showed.
In October, arrival of iron and steel scrap stood at 347,888 tonnes valuing $204m as compared to 331,003 tonnes costing $192m in September, while imports in October 2020 were 411,228 tonnes amounting to $161m. 
Manufacturers continued pushing up rates citing higher exchange rates, fuel and electricity prices and shortage of scrap. Amreli increased its steel bar price by Rs3,000 to Rs193,000-Rs195,000 per tonne depending on gauge and quality from Nov 15. Others also raised prices by Rs3,000-Rs5,000 to Rs192,500-Rs195,500 per tonne.

Steel bar prices have surged to Rs195,000 per tonne

Steel bar price in November 2020 was Rs110,000-113,000 per tonne.
F.F. Steel chief executive Zarak K. Khattak told Dawn on Saturday from Lahore that supply chain issues of shipping lines had severely affected the import of scrap in the last few months. “Pakistan-bound containers are stuck at different ports all over the world such as South Africa, India, Malaysia etc.”
He said 85pc of imported iron and steel bar was utilised in manufacturing of steel bars while the rest in making steel structures.
He said the working capital bank lines, which once sufficient for 100pc of the demand for different factories, were now only able to service 60pc of the tonnage due to surge in international scrap prices. 
Mr Khan said the global commodity rush is having its toll on all manufacturers around the world including Pakistan. After easing of pandemic, supply chain issues have erupted. He said China, which used to produce 850m tonnes out of total production of 1,650m tonnes, had reduced its iron ore production to cut it carbon foot print. The alternative route of steel making ie from scrap is witnessing a lot of pressure resulting in price hike on world markets.
He said Pakistan is wholly dependent on imported scrap as there are no iron ore-based blast furnaces in the country except Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM), which has been closed since 2016.
Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSP) secretary general  Wajid Bukhari claimed that “drop in iron and steel scrap imports need to be checked as to which kind of raw materials have faced decline. Scrap import may not be included in it. It must be cold rolled coiled steel from pipe mills. Scrap import is stable.” 
The production of  billets/ingots rose by 15pc to 1.229m tonnes in July-September  2021-22 from one million tonnes in the same period last year.  Billets are used in making  steel bars. 
Production of hot and cold rolled sheets, strips,  coils and plates, also known as flat steel products used in making steel  pipes, sheds, electronic items, went up by 12.5pc to 854,500 tonnes  from 759,500 tonnes in 3MFY21. 
Mr Khattak said increase in billet production was based on the import of iron and steel scrap made in June-August period.
