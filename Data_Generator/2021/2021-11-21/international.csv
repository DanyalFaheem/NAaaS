0,Riots break out in US city over court verdict,"Protesters gather following the acquittal of 18-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin.","PORTLAND: Portland  police on Friday night declared as a riot a demonstration downtown against  the acquittal of a teen who killed two people and injured another  during a protest in Wisconsin.
The protest of about 200 people was declared a riot after protesters started breaking windows, throwing  objects at police and talked about burning down the Justice Center, KOIN TV reported.
The protesters gathered following the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse, 18, in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Portland  Police Bureau Chief Chuck Lovell said shortly after the verdict that  officers were working on plans for Friday night and the weekend, KOIN  reported.
By about 8:50pm, about 200 protesters had gathered in downtown Portland and blocked streets.
By  9pm, windows were broken and doors of city facilities were damaged.  Police tweeted objects were being thrown at officers in the area, KOIN  reported.
The police tweeted: ""A crowd has gathered near SE 2nd  Avenue and SE Madison Street and participants have begun breaking  windows and damaging doors of city facilities in the area. People are  throwing objects at police officers in the area.""

 



 
Portland saw  ongoing, often violent protests after the murder of George Floyd last  year by police in Minneapolis. Some activists complained that the police  were heavy-handed in their response.
On Friday, a jury found the 18-year-old Rittenhouse not guilty of reckless and intentional homicide and other charges stemming from the shootings that took place in August 2020 in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
The ruling sparked protests in cities across the country late Friday — from New York to Portland, Oregon — as well as scattered clapping outside the courtroom, and it drew praise from gun rights advocates, highlighting the divisive nature of the case.
In comments broadcast by Fox News, the teen — seen smiling as he rides in a car after the verdict — said he was relieved that his  “rough journey” had come to an end.
“The jury reached the correct verdict - self-defense is not illegal,” Rittenhouse says to Fox, ahead of a tell-all interview to be shown Monday evening and a subsequent documentary about the teenager scheduled to air in December.
“I’m glad that everything went well... We made it through the hard part.” Rittenhouse’s case drew national attention, in part because it arose from the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that swept the country last year and featured a controversial mix of guns, racial tensions and vigilantism.
The teen testified during the two-week trial that he shot dead two men and wounded another with his AR-15 semi-automatic rifle in self-defense after being attacked during a night of unrest in Kenosha.
Rittenhouse, who lived in neighboring Illinois, claimed he went to Kenosha to protect businesses from looters and act as a medic.
Prosecutors countered by arguing the then 17-year-old Rittenhouse  “provoked” the events on a chaotic night sparked when a white policeman shot a Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back several times during an arrest, leaving him paralysed.
The reaction to the verdict reflected the national divide over the right to bear firearms in America — and where the line should be drawn on that constitutionally protected right. President Joe Biden warned against violence following the verdict and appealed for calm.

1,Poland says Belarus has changed tactics on migrant crisis,Polish minister says he expects the border showdown to be long drawn.,"HAJNOWKA: Poland said on Saturday that Belarus has changed tactics in their border crisis by directing smaller groups of migrants to several points along the European Union’s eastern frontier.
Though there have been signs of the crisis easing, Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said he expected the border showdown to be long drawn out while Belarus said the situation remained  “tense”.
Polish border guards reported new attempted crossings by several groups mostly consisting of dozens of migrants, though also including one crowd of 200 people hurling rocks and using tear gas.
“We have to prepare for the fact that this problem will continue for months. I have no doubt that that will be the case,” Blaszczak told RMF FM radio.
“Now a bit of a new method has been taken on by the migrants and Belarusian services... Smaller groups of people are trying to cross the border in many places.” 
He added that  “there is no question that these attacks are directed by Belarusian services.” The West accuses Belarus of artificially creating the crisis by bringing in would-be migrants — mostly from the Middle East — and taking them to the border with promises of an easy crossing into the European Union.
Belarus has denied the claim, instead criticising the EU for not taking in the migrants.
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko told the BBC on Friday that it was  “absolutely possible” his forces had helped people cross into the EU but denied orchestrating the operation.
“We’re Slavs. We have hearts. Our troops know the migrants are going to Germany... Maybe someone helped them,” he said. “But I didn’t invite them here.”
The migrants have abandoned everything in their countries, spending thousands of dollars to fly into Belarus on tourist visas, determined to reach the EU. There were indications this week that the crisis was abating after several hundred migrants were repatriated to Iraq, while 2,000 others left a makeshift border encampment for a nearby logistics centre.
Muluseu Mamo, a representative of the United Nations refugee agency in Belarus, visited the centre Saturday, saying that while conditions there were better than in the forest,  “much is missing”.
“If you ask if these are good conditions for further living, I would say no,” he was quoted by Russian state news agency RIA Novosti as telling reporters, adding that migrants there have complained about a lack of food, clothing and medical services.
Also Saturday, the Belarusian health ministry said that a World Health Organisation mission had arrived in Belarus to help organise medical support for the migrants.
Yemen’s foreign ministry said Saturday that it was working on bringing back its citizens from the border, including eight on the Belarusian side and nine in Poland. Polish border guards said that on Friday there had been 195 attempted illegal crossings, with 82 migrants ordered to leave Poland.
“The largest group consisted of around 200 foreigners, the others each numbered several dozen,” the guards tweeted on Saturday. “The foreigners were aggressive — they threw rocks, firecrackers and used tear gas.”
The Belarusian state border committee, meanwhile, said that  “the situation on the border remains tense”.
“Attempts to violently and brutally expel refugees from the territories of neighbouring EU member states continue,” the committee said on its Telegram channel.

2,30 dead or missing in Andhra Pradesh floods,"NEW DELHI: At least 30 people are dead or missing after flash floods hit southern India, reports said on Saturday,...","NEW DELHI: At least 30 people are dead or missing after flash floods hit southern India, reports said on Saturday, with three buses washed away in one incident.
Rescue teams pulled out a dozen bodies after three buses were washed away in Andhra Pradesh state on Friday. At least 18 other people were still missing, media outlet The NewsMinute reported.
Analysts say unpredictable and extreme weather across South Asia is driven by climate change, exacerbated by damming, deforestation and excessive development.
Dozens have died since October in India after heavy rains triggered floods and landslides, and the country’s Met office said more heavy rains were expected in several southern areas on Saturday.
At least 42 people were killed last month when heavy rains pummelled Kerala, and on Friday authorities in the state halted entry to Sabarimala, one of Hinduism’s holiest shrines, due to heavy rains in the area.
Hundreds of devotees have been making the trek to Sabarimala since the shrine opened last week for the annual two-month-long pilgrimage season.
Rising water levels in the Pamba river, considered holy by the pilgrims, forced officials to stop devotees for a day, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported.Andhra Pradesh has been hit by intense torrents since Thursday, sparking massive floods in at least five districts.
Three people were killed  when a building collapsed, police said. Ten people trapped under the  debris were rescued but two are still missing.
Search and rescue efforts for missing passengers continued on  Saturday.
Deaths from various districts have been reported over  the past few days, with officials warning that the numbers could rise as  rescue operations carry on. Teams of the National Disaster Relief Force  have been deployed to worst-hit and vulnerable districts, and local  authorities have rescued and evacuated hundreds of families to shelter  homes.
In Kadapa district, one of the worst-hit, incessant rains  and floods forced officials to close down the local airport until  Thursday. Officials said breaches in dams and tanks have caused further  flooding, leaving hundreds of villages marooned and many residents stuck  in their homes.
Rains in southern India at this time are not  unusual, although the country has seen a prolonged monsoon this year  with experts warning that climate change has exacerbated the problem by  making downpours more intense and frequent.
Last week, neighboring  Tamil Nadu state was struck by floods while at least 28 people in  southern Kerala state died as heavy rains triggered landslides last  month.

3,Sudanese call for anti-coup protests as death toll rises to 40,Both the United States and African Union have condemned the deadly crackdown on protesters.,"KHARTOUM: Sudanese anti-coup activists called for mass protests on Sunday, as hundreds held demonstrations denouncing the deadly crackdown which left 40 people killed since last month’s military takeover.
Both the United States and African Union have condemned the deadly crackdown on protesters and called on Sudan’s leaders to refrain from the  “excessive use of force”.
Sudan’s top general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Oct 25 declared a state of emergency, ousted the government and detained the civilian leadership.
The military takeover upended a two-year transition to civilian rule, drew wide international condemnation and punitive measures, as well as provoking people to take to the streets.
Protests on Wednesday provoked the deadliest day so far, with the death toll standing at 16 after a teenager who had been shot died, medics said. The independent Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said the 16-year-old had been shot  “by live rounds to the head and the leg”.
Most of those killed on Wednesday were in North Khartoum, which lies across the Nile river from the capital, medics said.
On Saturday, hundreds of protesters rallied against the military in North Khartoum, building street barricades and setting tyres on fire, a correspondent said.
They chanted  “no, no to military rule” and called for  “civilian rule”.
During the unrest, a police station was set on fire, the correspondent said, adding that there were no police agents in the vicinity. It was not immediately clear who torched it.
The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA) have urged protesters to keep up their campaign.
On Saturday, pro-democracy activists made online calls for mass anti-coup protests with a  “million-strong march on Nov 21”.
The SPA is an umbrella of unions which were instrumental in the months-long demonstrations that led to the ousting of president Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.
Dozens of protesters also rallied on Saturday to mourn the latest deaths in North Khartoum, demanding  “retribution” and a transition to civilian rule.
Police officials deny using any live ammunition and insist they have used  “minimum force” to disperse the protests. They have recorded only one death, among demonstrators in North Khartoum. On Friday, small groups of protesters rallied in several neighbourhoods after prayers against the military coup.
In North Khartoum, the built barricades across roads as police forces sporadically fired tear gas until late at night to disperse them, witnesses said.
A correspondent said police forces also frisked passers-by and carried out identification checks. The SPA said security forces had also  “stormed homes and mosques” there on Friday. The US and African Union denounced the deadly crackdown.
“We call for those responsible for human rights abuses and violations, including the excessive use of force against peaceful protesters, to be held accountable,” US State Department spokesman Ned Price said.
“In advance of upcoming protests, we call on Sudanese authorities to use restraint and allow peaceful demonstrations,” he added.
The African Union, which suspended Sudan after the coup, also condemned  “in the strongest terms” Wednesday’s violence.

4,Ethiopia hails return of looted artefacts,Calls have long been mounting in Africa for Western countries to return their colonial spoils.,"ADDIS ABABA: Ethiopia on Saturday hailed the return of precious artefacts looted by British soldiers more than 150 years ago, after a long campaign for their restitution.
The collection — recovered from Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands — includes a ceremonial crown, an imperial shield, a set of silver-embossed horn drinking cups, a handwritten prayer book, crosses and a necklace.
Most of the items were plundered by the British army after it defeated Emperor Tewodros II in the Battle of Magdala in 1868 in what was then Abyssinia.
The treasures were unwrapped before the media at Ethiopia’s national museum on Saturday, more than two months after they were formally handed over at a ceremony in London in September.
Ethiopia said it was the largest such repatriation of artefects to the country, with its ambassador to Britain, Teferi Melesse, describing it as of  “huge significance”.
Calls have long been mounting in Africa for Western countries to return their colonial spoils, with many prized national treasures held abroad in museums or sometimes private collections.
Earlier this month, the West African state of Benin welcomed back nearly 30 royal treasures seized during France’s rule more than 130 years ago.
The Ethiopian government is still fighting for Britain to return other stolen artefacts including sacred wooden and stone tabots or tablets, which represent the Ark of the Covenant.
The tabots are housed in the British Museum in London — which has a vast trove of foreign treasures — but have never been put on public display.
Ethiopia is also seeking the remains of Tewodros’ son Prince Alemayehu who was taken to Britain after the emperor committed suicide following his battlefield defeat.
“A variety of artefacts which are a legacy of our culture and values were looted during the battle and taken out of the country illegally,” said Tourism Minister Nasise Challi.

But motorists hoping to line their pockets with an unexpected pre-Thanksgiving windfall were thwarted, as police cracked down and arrested two people.
“There’s a lot of video evidence of people stealing the cash from the freeway, picking it up,” California Highway Patrol Sgt. Curtis Martin told a news conference.

 

 
The money — of various denominations, totaling thousands of dollars — belongs to a bank and must be returned to a police station, he added.
The freeway free-for-all began after a door of the armored truck flew open near San Diego on the Interstate-5, which runs from California’s Mexican border all the way to Canada.
Video posted to social media showed people dashing around the roadway, scooping up cash and even throwing handfuls of greenbacks into the air in celebration.
“Have you ever seen this before?! What would you do?!” posted @demibagby on Instagram. But police warned that the same footage would be used to track down anyone who does not swiftly hand over the cash.

6,"Houthis say they attacked Saudi cities, Aramco facilities",CAIRO: Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement said on Saturday it had fired 14 drones at several Saudi Arabian...,"CAIRO: Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement said on Saturday it had fired 14 drones at several Saudi Arabian cities, including at Saudi Aramco facilities in Jeddah.
The Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis in Yemen had on Friday said it destroyed three drones launched towards southern Saudi Arabia and a fourth over Yemen. It said the group  “failed to launch two ballistic missiles” and they fell inside Yemen.
Saudi Aramco, the state oil firm, said when contacted that it would respond at the earliest opportunity.
The Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said in a televised press conference that the group had attacked Aramco’s refineries in Jeddah as well as military targets in Riyadh, Jeddah, Abha, Jizan and Najran.
Sarea’s statement contained inaccuracies. It mentioned the wrong name for the international airport in Jeddah and the wrong location for King Khalid base, saying it was in Riyadh when it is actually in the south of the kingdom.
The Saudi-led coalition said later on Saturday it has attacked 13 targets during a military operation against the Houthis in Yemen.
The operation hit weapons depots, air defence systems and drones’ communication systems in Sanaa, Saada, and Marib provinces, the coalition said.
Aramco’s refinery in Jeddah was decommissioned in 2017 but it has a petroleum products distribution plant there that the Houthis had previously targeted in March.
The Houthis have repeatedly launched cross border attacks on Saudi Arabia using drones and missiles since the coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the movement ousted the Saudi-backed government from the capital, Sanaa. Efforts led by the United Nations and the United States to engineer a ceasefire in Yemen have stalled.

7,Afghan Taliban begin paying salaries to govt employees,Finance ministry spokesman says some govt employees will also be paid for the month before the Taliban took power.,"KABUL: Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities said on Saturday they had begun paying government employees who had not received a paycheck since the Islamists seized power and triggered a major financial crisis.
Most government employees have yet to return to work and many had not been paid for months even before the Taliban captured power, especially rural workers.
“We are going to start paying salaries from today. We will pay three months’ salaries,” Ahmad Wali Haqmal, spokesman for the finance ministry said at a press conference.
Haqmal said salaries will be paid for the period starting August 23, adding that some government employees will be paid even for the month before the Taliban took power.
The payment will be made through the country’s banking system which Haqmal said had not been  “paralysed” since the fall of the previous government.
“It just needs time to operate normally,” he said.
The government employees will still be unable to access their full salaries.
Since August, Afghanistan’s banking sector has collapsed, and those with money in the bank have struggled to access their funds as branches curtailed withdrawals to $200 to $400 a week.
The financial crunch was aggravated after Washington froze about $10 billion of assets held in its reserve for Kabul and deteriorated further after the World Bank and International Monetary Fund halted Afghanistan’s access to funding.
Foreign donors led by the United States provided more than 75 percent of the public expenditure under Afghanistan’s previous 20-year Washington-backed government.
The rapidly worsening situation has forced Afghans to sell their household goods to raise money for food and other essentials with the local currency crashing and prices skyrocketing.
Meraj Mohammad Meraj, the spokesman for the government’s revenue department, said the authorities were in a position to pay salaries after earning revenues of 26 billion Afghanis (around $277 million) in the past two and half months.
“Only 20 to 25 percent of the economy was operational... Not all sectors are currently operational,” Meraj said at the press conference.
He added that the authorities will introduce a new Islamic tax to fund aid projects for poor people and orphans.

8,Germany’s gender-balanced cabinet takes shape as coalition deal nears,Coalition officials have repeatedly said that cabinet posts will be decided at the very end of coalition negotiations.,"BERLIN: Germany’s next cabinet is taking shape as coalition negotiations near a deal, with chancellor-in-waiting Olaf Scholz determined to deliver on his campaign pledge to have as many women as men in his team, sources said on Saturday.
Scholz’s centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), who narrowly won the federal election in September by beating Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, are trying to form a three-way ruling coalition with the pro-spending Greens and the fiscally conservative Free Democrats (FDP).
The SPD is set to nominate at least three women for cabinet posts: outgoing Environment Minister Svenja Schulze, outgoing Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht and Scholz’s former running mate in the race for party co-leadership Klara Geywitz, three people familiar with the decision said.
Schulze is expected to become economy or transformation minister, Lambrecht will likely be in charge of the interior portfolio including migration and Geywitz could get the science and education ministry, the sources said.
Depending on the coalition horse trading, the SPD could also nominate lawmaker and human rights expert Baerbel Kofler for the economic cooperation and development portfolio.
Among the SPD men, Scholz will lead the next government as chancellor, his right-hand man Wolfgang Schmidt is expected to become his chief of staff and Labour Minister Hubertus Heil is set to keep his job thanks to his strong performance during the Covid-19 pandemic, the sources said.
Coalition officials have repeatedly said that cabinet posts will be decided at the very end of coalition negotiations. Party officials have hinted that an agreement could be reached in the coming week, possibly as early as Monday or Tuesday.
FDP leader Christian Lindner is pushing to become finance minister, though Greens co-leader Robert Habeck was also keen on the post to guarantee enough public resources to pay for Germany’s faster shift towards a climate-friendly economy.
On Friday, Lindner said fears he would be a fiscal hawk as finance minister were overblown despite his repeated calls for solid public finances and debt reduction after the coronavirus crisis.
If Lindner get his way, Habeck is likely to lead a beefed-up climate ministry while Greens co-leader Annalena Baerbock is expected to become Germany’s first female foreign minister.
During the election campaign, Baerbock has called for a tougher approach towards Russia and China.
