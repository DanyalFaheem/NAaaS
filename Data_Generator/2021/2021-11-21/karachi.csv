0,"DNAs didn’t match in Dr Maha death case, court told",Investigating officer says a supplementary charge sheet will be filed after DNA matching is completed.,"KARAHCI: Police informed a sessions court on Saturday that the DNA sample of two accused had not matched with those of Dr Maha Shah, who had committed suicide after being blackmailed and harassed in Karachi. 
Initially, the police said the 34-year-old doctor practicing at a private hospital in Clifton had allegedly committed suicide by shooting herself at her home in DHA on Aug 18, 2020. 
Later, eight men — including her friends Junaid Khan, Waqas Hasan, Bilal, Yasin, Saad, Syed Tabish, Munir and Nasir — were charged with luring the victim into drugs, harassing and blackmailing her that led her to commit suicide. 
On Saturday, the matter came up before Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Ashraf Hussain Khowaja, when Syed Tabish, Junaid and Saad appeared on bail, while Waqas was absent. 
The investigating officer filed a report regarding the chemical analysis of the DNA samples of accused Junaid and Waqas, which had been sent to a laboratory for cross-matching with those of the victim. 
He informed that the samples of the two men drawn on the court’s order were sent to the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Science for cross-matching with those of the victim. 
“But, the report has shown negative results of the DNA matching of the accused with the victim,” stated the IO Sharafat in his report coupled with the chemical analysis report of the laboratory. 
Taking the report on its record, the judge fixed the matter on Dec 11 for recording the testimony of the complainant, who is the father of the victim. 
The complainant, Asif Ali Shah, had lodged an FIR against his daughter’s friends for causing her to commit suicide. 
In August, the court had indicted the victim’s ex-boyfriend Junaid Khan, his friend Waqas Hasan and her friends, Saad Nasir and Tabish Yasin, under manslaughter and rape charges. 
According to the charge sheet, Khan and Hasan allegedly raped her and caused the disappearance of the evidence to save them while Nasir and Yasin provided an illegal weapon to her which she used to end her life. 
Police had listed 38 witnesses, including the family members of the victim, a judicial magistrate who had supervised exhumation of the body for a second post-mortem examination on the court’s order, members of the medical board and others. 
Police had mentioned in the charge sheet that Khan and Rizvi used to torture her mentally and physically due to which she was suffering from severe anguish and had tried to commit suicide even before. 
It suspected that both the accused subjected the victim to rape, thus they were avoiding giving their samples for DNA matching. 
The IO said a supplementary charge sheet would be filed after the DNA matching was done. 
The report also stated that the victim was addicted to drugs which she procured from peddlers identified as Anmol alias Pinki, Nasir Baloch, Munir, Saadullah, Jamaat Ali and Bilal. They were charged separately. 
The court had taken cognizance of the offence under Sections 376 (punishment for rape), 322 (manslaughter), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

1,Scores of huts destroyed in Karachi's Teen Hatti blaze,The fire has left a large number of people living along the Lyari river without any shelter.,"KARACHI: A huge fire destroyed at least 100 huts in the Teen Hatti area along the Lyari Expressway while a tanker carrying thousands of litre oil caught fire at a fuel station in Saddar on Saturday.
However, no loss of life was reported in the two incidents, police and fire officials said.
In the first incident, the fire left a large number of people, including women and children, living along the Lyari river shelterless.
Chief Fire Officer Mubeen Ahmed said they received information about the fire at around 8.15am. Initially, three fire engines were sent from the nearby Nazimabad fire station. Later, realising the intensity of the fire, seven more fire engines were despatched, which managed to douse the fire.
He said the huts were built with cloths or tents and all the huts were connected with each other with piece of cloths. Therefore, when the fire erupted in one hut, it rapidly spread and engulfed 10-12 other huts, he said.

Another big tragedy averted as oil tanker fire at Saddar fuel station put out

The fire chief estimated that around 100 huts were destroyed.
He said the area residents immediately left the place and also save their children. They tried to save their utensils and other valuable. 
He said that this was the second fire incident at the same place as a fire had also erupted there last year destroying 150 huts.
Oil tanker fire at fuel station
In the second incident that took place at around 11.15am, an oil tanker caught fire at a PSO petrol pump, opposite the Parking Plaza, near Saddar. Three employees of the fuel station suffered burn injuries, police and firemen said.
The chief fire officer said that as they had just extinguished an earlier fire erupted in huts at Teen Hatti on Saturday and fire machines had just arrived their stations, they received information about another fire at a petrol pump. 
He said several fire engines, including one snorkel, were refilled with water immediately and brought from different fire stations in the metropolis to meet any eventuality. “The fire in oil works like a bomb and it is not easy to control it,” he said, adding that they used foam as the fire was sliding and had spread on the road and firemen put their life in danger to control it. 
Brigade Police SHO Khaliq Rafiq said that the blaze erupted in the oil truck belonging to the PSO, which was delivering oil to the fuel station. 
While the SHO said the fire had erupted due to a short circuit in the driver’s cabin, the fire chief said that it needed to be investigated. 
The fire chief said the fire erupted in the tanker when it was transferring oil to an underground tank. He asked why the valve of the oil tank was not closed immediately. 
There were fire extinguishers at the petrol pump, but they were not used to put out the fire. And when the fire broke out, the employees just ran away. 
Delivery rules violation 
Moreover, the fire chief said under the rules concerned and the policy of the government, oil trucks were supposed to deliver oil at fuel stations after the midnight. He asked as to why the PSO’s oil truck was delivering petrol in the daytime. 
He described it as ‘negligence’ on the part of the quarters concerned. 
The area SHO said the tank was filled with oil and estimated 21,000 litres of oil was burnt.

4,Action against culprits of child abuse demanded,Many people participate in a walk to mark Universal Children’s Day...,"KARACHI: Speakers at a walk held on Saturday in connection with Universal Children’s Day expressed concern over rampant violation of children’s rights in the country and rising incidence of child abuse.
They demanded that the government take immediate action against culprits of child abuse and ensure provision of fundamental rights to children.
The walk, which started from Arts Council and concluded at the Karachi Press Club, was organised by Konpal, Child Abuse Prevention Society, in collaboration with Medical and Social Welfare Committee of Arts Council.
A number of children rights supporters, parents, doctors, teachers and children participated in the 
walk with the theme ‘Investing in future means investing in our children’. 

Many people participate in a walk to mark Universal Children’s Day

“If we want to secure our future, the first thing we must do is to protect our children from abuse. This can be done with strict implementation of all laws pertaining to children’s rights in letter and spirit and taking immediate action against culprits of child abuse,” Dr Aisha Mehnaz said.
The senior paediatrician and chairperson of Konpal regretted official apathy towards children’s rights and said the whole nation would have to pay the price of this indifference.
“Pakistan has no future if it fails to invest in its children that constitute more than half of its population. The whole nation will pay the price of official apathy, if the government fails to provide justice to victims of child abuse,” she said.
Prof Mehnaz also referred to the United Nations Convention on Child Rights to which Pakistan was a signatory and said it contained fundamental steps required to be taken to help ensure mental and physical well-being of a child.
Dr Qaiser Sajjad, chairperson of the medical and social wing of Arts Council, highlighted how persistent official neglect had affected children’s health.
“A disturbingly high number of child abuse cases, growing malnutrition and preventable infectious diseases in children and low immunisation coverage, especially in Sindh, is a matter of big embarrassment for us,” he said.
The speakers emphasised that the government, community and political leaders give priority to the problems being faced by children.
Sindh PMA president Dr Mirza Ali Azhar also spoke.

5,Akhtar Hameed Khan’s contribution to urban public projects highlighted,The renowned social scientist’s motto was simple living...,"KARACHI: The Akhtar Hameed Khan Conference on Social Develop­ment organised by the NED University of Engineering and Technology, at their City Campus on Saturday didn’t just celebrate the life and times of the renowned social scientist and development practitioner but also looked at his kind of work and wisdom.
Speaking about his contribution in evolving urban public projects, architect and town planner Arif Hasan said that Dr Akhtar Hameed Khan’s thinking was based on making one self sufficient. 
“He wanted communities to work at providing basic infrastructure for themselves developing an understanding of each other while working collectively together,” said Mr Hasan.
“He had good reason for this. He used to say that there has been too much physical and social dislocation due to which local governance systems are losing their roles as new communities with misplaced roots emerge. They need to get together again to work and bond,” he said.

The renowned social scientist’s motto was simple living

“Through his programmes for development, he wanted to spread awareness and teach the people some skill as well,” he added.
Orangi sanitation project
Talking about the sanitation project in Orangi Town, Mr Hasan said that Akhtar Hameed Khan’s sanitation project had several issues. He said that in 1981, when he appeared on the scene he found him looking for some solutions. “The UN adviser appointed by the BCCI wanted Doctor Sahib to move from Orangi to a nice spot with a nice office where international donors would feel comfortable. But he would not budge because he said that the people they wanted to help, the people of Orangi, felt at home at his Orangi office. He was also against air conditioning, which eventually had to be brought in for the computers.
“Then the UN advisers wanted students as social organisers while Doctor Sahib wanted community people appointed there. But the UN advisers saw them as just musclemen. The students, graduates actually, were seen more useful for documentation. Then when they needed a map of Orangi there wasn’t one. A survey company was called. They provided an estimate. Doctor Sahib had a problem with their cost. He then wondered if the students could do the survey instead. We brought in 40 students from Dawood College and NED for the survey. These students would be roaming around Orangi. They would spend time with the people of the community and that helped them learn about katchi abadis, which they took back to their universities,” he said.
“The social organisers were important, but they were not students or graduates. They were all from Orangi — a community activist, a plumber, a rickshaw driver, a land developer, which one would call an encroacher. But they were really our teachers. They taught us about the real issues of the area,” he said.
He also said that in 1981 when he began his involvement with the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP), he was asked some key questions by Akhtar Hameed Khan. 
“He asked me why a sanitation programme was so expensive. Why it required loans? Could it be made cheaper so that people could do it themselves? I explained that that government sanitation costs were six to seven times more due to various factors including old tendering ways and the way contractors were hired. Then our international loans doubled the government’s costs. We had taken many development loans and say one rupee labour material would cost Rs20 as a result. We took this to the governor of Sindh who realised that projects worth Rs100 million could be done in Rs20m. Then if we brought in our own engineering standards while relieving the contractors also, the construction cost of Rs 4,000 would drop to Rs 600. Doctor Sahib found that quite affordable and acceptable.
“We looked at sanitation in two parts — internal development and external development. For the internal part, the people of the community would make sewers and the government would make sewerage plants. But our standards and way of work brought on several arguments. We were informed that the system will collapse. I was seen as some kind of a quack and the system I had designed was said to be under-designed. I said that I have not studied sanitation so they were welcome to call in a proper engineer. But Doctor Sahib was afraid that the new fellow would demand too much. So he stuck with me and said that ‘we will sink or swim together’. Then the foreign experts who were sure that our system was a failure returned to find it holding up very well. They wanted our calculations, they wanted to team up for a joint patent of the design. We didn’t want a patent. We wanted it used by all,” he said.
‘Govt lost an opportunity of a century’
Earlier, in his keynote address, Rural Support Programmes Network chairman Shoaib Sultan Khan spoke about Akhtar Hameed Khan’s life, from Comilla (in Chittagong, Bangladesh) to Orangi. 
He spoke about his innate qualities, his scholarship, his vision, his Buddhist way of life, his understanding of Quran and his passion for helping others.
“He had a versatile and complete personality. He was a complete human being whose motto was simple living. He carried praise for the British but he left civil service because he believed that they could not teach him anymore than he had learned from them. And then he became a labourer,” he said.
“When I had first heard of Akhtar Hameed Khan from the younger brother of a colleague in Comilla, he was all praise about his principal. I had dismissed it as the babbling of a teenager. But then three years later, I myself came face to face with the man himself,” he said before speaking at length about their lasting association.
“He wanted self-sustaining programmes and that is what he was doing with OPP. He said that the government was fickle and as it changed, it changed its mind. So he was not in favour of funding and grants. His greatest quality was flexibility and keeping an open mind. He had the vision and foresight to change circumstances and had faith in the self-reliance of people. The government didn’t use his expertise, and in that it lost an opportunity of a century,” he said.
In his welcome address, Prof Dr Noman Ahmed, head of the Department of Architecture and Planning at NED University, said that Akhtar Hameed Khan’s life and work reminds us to follow his kind of thinking. “His work and the organisations he set up ask to be revisited by our youth. And that’s the aim and focus of this conference,” he said.
The many others who spoke included researcher Mansoor Raza, Senator Taj Haider, rights activist Karamat Ali, Rabia Siddiqui of Dawood College and Tasneem Siddiqui of Khuda ki Basti were also among the many who spoke and shared their fond memories. 
Meanwhile, Anwer Rashid, Dr Mansoor Ali, Hafiz Rashid and Sumera Gul, who were also close associates of Akhtar Hameed Khan and worked with OPP at different times in various capacities, sent in recorded messages. 
Community development practitioner Fayyaz Baqir joined in live from Canada.

6,Absence of three accused delays witnesses’ testimony in sedition case,Held MNA Wazir is facing trial in a case pertaining to delivering an incendiary speech against state institutions...,"KARACHI: An antiterrorism court on Saturday adjourned till Dec 11 the hearing of a sedition case against MNA Ali Wazir and 10 other activists of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) due to the absence of three accused.
Police had booked PTM’s chief Manzoor Pashteen along with its leaders — MNA Wazir and MNA Mohsin Dawar, Muhammad Shafi and Hidayatullah Pashteen — for allegedly committing sedition by inciting the public to wage a war against the state by delivering provocative speeches against security forces at a rally held in Sohrab Goth on Dec 6, 2020.
On Saturday, the matter came up before the ATC-XII judge, who was set to record testimonies of prosecution witnesses. The interned MNA was produced from prison while other accused appeared on bail except three of them, who failed to ensure their appearance, judicial officials and lawyers said.

Held MNA Wazir is facing trial in a case pertaining to delivering an incendiary speech against state institutions

The special public prosecutor produced 15 witnesses to record their testimonies in the case. However, the witnesses could not be deposed due to the absence of the three accused.
The judge directed all the accused and their counsel to ensure their presence in court on the next date of hearing.
According to the prosecution, SHO Riaz Ahmed Bhutto had received information that PTM leaders along with 1,800-2,000 Pakhtuns, members and supporters of PTM in a playground opposite Al-Asif Square were preparing for a gathering without getting requisite permission from the department concerned.
It further stated that MNA Ali Wazir along with 10 other leaders as well as three proclaimed offenders, including Manzoor Pashteen, delivered hate speech by using sound system in Urdu and Pashto languages.
“Such speeches were recorded and got translated, which revealed that those hate speeches were against armed forces, civil armed forces, institution of Pakistan and State of Pakistan and a community,” it said. 
On Nov 3, the court had indicted Ali Wazir and 10 others for sedition.
On Oct 13, the court had declared PTM chief Manzoor Pashteen, MNA Dawar, Shafi and Hidayatullah, as proclaimed offenders after the investigating officer and revenue officials submitted their reports regarding completion of the process of their proclamation and attachment of properties. In his report, the IO had submitted that there was no likelihood of arrest of the PTM’s chief and three other leaders in the near future.
Police had arrested Wazir on Dec 16, 2020 in Peshawar in connection with the case on a request of the Sindh police and flown to Karachi.
In a charge sheet filed earlier, the IO had informed the court that the accused were found involved in committing offences punishable under Sections 120-B (punishment of criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging or attempting to wage war or abetting waging of war against Pakistan), 121-A (conspiracy to commit offences punishable under Section 121), 124-A (sedition), 153 (wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot), 153-A (promoting enmity between different groups, etc), 505 (statements conducing to public mischief), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.

7,Mental health screening can improve quality of diabetic patients’ life: experts,"KARACHI: Routine mental health screenings and assessment tools can improve diabetes outcomes,...","KARACHI: Routine mental health screenings and assessment tools can improve diabetes outcomes, evidence-based-treatment, and quality of life, suggested experts at an event held on Saturday at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC). The Annual Diabetes Symposium was organised by the Diabetes Clinical Ward 7 Medical Unit of JPMC in connection with World Diabetes Day.
During the programme, a panel of experts including endocrinologists, diabetologists, dermatologists, nephrologists discussed the untapped aspects of diabetes care, essential for students, general physicians and medical practitioners.
In his speech, acting Vice Chancellor of Jinnah Sindh Medical University (JSMU) and JPMC Executive Director Prof Shahid Rasul expressed concern over the worrisome figures of diabetes prevalence that currently affected 33 million people in Pakistan that had the third-highest diabetes prevalence in the world.
The keynote speech on the correlation between diabetes and the pandemic was delivered by Prof Syed Masroor Ahmed, dean of Medicine JSMU. He explained that excessive body fat and obesity increased mortality risk in Covid-19 patients.
‘Increase in diabetes prevalence is a major health and economic burden, and policy makers should make it a top priority on their political agenda,” he said. Dr Qaiser Iqbal of the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital said improved lifestyle, metabolism, and management were the keys to diabetes control.
“Depression, diabetic distress and the psycho-social aspects of diabetes often go unrecognised and unaddressed. The screening rate remains low, due to lack of training of healthcare providers,” stressed Dr Shabnam Naveed.
She also pointed out that healthcare practices lacked mental health assessment tools and that healthcare protocols must be defined for evaluating somatic and cognitive symptoms of depression in diabetic patients.
During the second-panel discussion focusing on complications and co-morbidities of diabetes, Dr Urooj Lal Rehman spoke about gestational diabetes and management whereas Prof Khalid Sher shed light on diabetes and dementia. Dr Shafiqur Rehman reflected on the impact of diabetes on bone health through a detailed presentation.
The symposium was followed by a question and answer session by a panel of experts including Prof Zaman Sheikh from Sir Syed Hospital, Prof Najm-ul-Islam from Aga Khan University Hospital, Prof Haleema Yasmeen and Prof Khadija from JPMC.

8,Study on premature coronary atherosclerosis in young people launched,KARACHI: A local pharmaceutical firm in partnership with the Tabba Heart Institute on Saturday formally launched the...,"KARACHI: A local pharmaceutical firm in partnership with the Tabba Heart Institute on Saturday formally launched the first-ever Pakistan study on premature coronary atherosclerosis in young adults called Pak-Sehat.
Launching the study at a local hotel, health experts and medical scientists highlighted the effectiveness of the study and called it a timely initiative from Getz Pharma and Tabba Institute which would benefit the country’s health system in the longer run.
They said that that the Pak-Sehat project was the largest, first-of-its-kind and 10-year nationwide longitudinal cohort study on atherosclerotic risk assessment in the healthy young Pakistani population.
Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, causing approximately 32 per cent of annual deaths, said the experts. 
Low-income and middle-income countries, they added, in particular, are experiencing the highest prevalence and mortality rates of cardiovascular disease.
“This research study will help determine risk factors for coronary heart disease so that early detection can be done, and disease can be prevented rather than treated,” said Dr Bashir Hanif of the Tabba Heart Institute, who is also the principal investigator of the Pak-Sehat study. 
Dr Wajiha Javed, head of Getz Pharma’s public health & research, shared the project brief of the study with the media and health professionals.
“This 10-year joint venture will help determine risk factors for coronary heart disease so that early detection can be done and disease can be prevented rather than treated,” she said.
The experts said that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The risk of ASCVD, they said, varies among different ethnicities. However, the risk is fourfold in the South Asian population compared to other races, they added.
The traditional risk factors associated with premature ASCVD are also alarming in the Pakistani population, with 50pc of adults suffering from hypertension, of which 70pc are unaware of their disease status.
“The findings from a study of this scale can provide groundbreaking results. It would help in informing future health policy targeting the native Pakistani population and it would allow early interventions for patients with risk of ASCVD from a younger age,” said Dr Wajiha.
She said that the initiative aimed to contribute to the growing research database in Pakistan and promote early screening and prevention for cardiovascular disease in the country.

He was speaking to journalists at Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf regional secretariat on Saturday. “The rotation policy of officers’ transfers is for entire Pakistan but Sindh chief minister says that Sindh is being discriminated against. This policy has nothing to do with Sindh as it is not Sindh specific,” he said.
“The federal government is empowered to post its officers wherever it likes. It is federal government’s legal right,” he said and disagreed with CM’s view that the federal government was bound to consult with the chief minister in this regard.
He said that electronic voting machine (EVM) would address all complaints about delay in announcement of results in election and rigging. No one would now be able to say that the results were withheld or changed, he said. 
He said that only those parties were opposing the use of technology in election who believed they would lose in fair election. Only ‘thappa mafia’ felt at losing end, he said.
Governor said earlier while addressing party workers at the secretariat that Imran Khan had promised to establish Hyderabad University and only Pakistan Peoples Party had opposed it. “I never seen anyone opposing a university,” he said.
He said that 7,000 schools were being closed instead of providing better teaching staff and academic environment in Sindh. People of Sindh were being deprived of their right to education, he said.
He said that PTI would again form government in centre as well as in Sindh and the party would get its mayor elected from among people of Hyderabad.
PTI leader Haleem Adil Sheikh said that Hyderabad would get mega projects after the prime minister had fulfilled his promise of establishment of Hyderabad University.
He said that party leadership would resolve problems of deduction of Rs2,000 from cash handouts under Ehsaas programme of federal government. Sindh government failed to ensure transparency in the programme’s management, he said. 
The governor told journalists before leaving for Tando Allahyar that Sindh’s rulers did not want to provide education to people as they wanted to keep children illiterate and work as their haris. 
He said that Sindh needed change and federal government was restrained from providing health cards to people of Sindh. “Does Sindh government not like design of health card?”, he said. He said that kissan card and Ehsas grant was being given by federal government.
Haleem Adil Sheikh said that PTI workers had to fight a battle in Sindh. Sindh’s rulers were not allowing PTI government to distribute health cards in Sindh.

Police citing preliminary investigation said Kahna, son of Pritam Kumar, was apparently subjected to criminal assault before being throttled to death. 
The boy was a student of St Mary’s School and had gone missing while playing outside his home after returning home from the school on Friday.  
The news of his murder sent a wave of shock among teachers and students of the school who held a protest demonstration on and outside its premises on Saturday.
According to the Babarloi police, the body was spotted by his parents and relatives who had mounted a hectic search for the boy since he had gone missing. 
The police said that the victim’s body also bore marks of torture. “He might have been hit with clubs and bricks,” they said.
Saint Mary’s School principal Sister Rosey Yacoub, leading the demonstration, expressed her profound grief over the student’s gruesome murder and said it was shameful that the incident had taken place while the world was observing Universal Children’s Day. She demanded immediate arrest of the culprits and justice to the bereaved family.
Meanwhile, the area police arrested two suspects, Syed Inaam Shah and Mudassir Maghanhar, in connection with the murder.

12,"No let-up in child abuse in Sindh over last decade, seminar told",‘Statistics show rights bodies fail to improve situation’...,"HYDERABAD: Speakers at a seminar held here on Saturday to mark Universal Children’s Day have urged Sindh government to utilise funds for protection of children’s future and ensure their rights to life, survival, health and education.
The seminar organised by the Hari Welfare Association (HWA) and district social welfare department in Shadeed Benazirabad discussed this year’s theme ‘A better future for every child’.
A Child Club activist, Ms Sabreen, said that quated an NGO as reporting that 861 cases of child abuses were recorded in Sindh in 2019. They include 155 cases of abduction, 231 cases of missing children and 85 cases of child marriages. In the same year, out of total 104 underage marriage cases in the country, 82pc were reported in Sindh.

‘Statistics show rights bodies fail to improve situation’

These cases showed that protection of children was not ensured by the authorities concerned, she said, and added that same number (861) of children were abused in the province in 2020. They included 390 cases of sexual abuse, 190 of abduction, 231 cases of missing children and 81 cases of underage marriages, she said.
Her club colleague, Ms Rabea, cited the Pakistan Education Statistics report stating that 6.4m children, including 3.3m girls, remained out-of-school. They were deprived of their fundamental right to education. She said these children were unable to attend school because of poverty, unavailability of a school nearby, lack of government’s interest to invest in education, lack of awareness and a high rate of corporal punishment.
HWA president Akram Ali Khaskheli noted that the Sindh Child Protection Authority, Sindh Human Rights Commission and Sindh Commission on Status of Women had been in place for a decade while there had already been the National Commission on Rights of Child (NCRC) at national level but these institutions could not mitigate sufferings of children.
“Children’s future in Sindh is not bright; worst forms of child and bonded labour are prevalent in this district but no steps have been taken in this regard,” he claimed.
Mr Khaskheli said these organisations would only pay lip service as they did not push governments to put in place proper systems and mechanisms at district level to protect children from slavery in agriculture and other sectors and kilns as well as in bangle, garment and other industries.

13,No flour crisis in province: minister,KARACHI: There is no crisis of wheat flour availability anywhere in the province from Karachi to Kashmore as the...,"KARACHI: There is no crisis of wheat flour availability anywhere in the province from Karachi to Kashmore as the Sindh government has been supplying 240,000 tonnes wheat to flour mills every month since Oct 15 to keep ex-mill price of the staple food item at as low a rate as Rs55 per kilogram.
The disclosure was made at a press conference jointly addressed by Minister for Food, Excise & Taxation Mukesh Kumar Chawla and Minister for Information and Labour Saeed Ghani at Sindh Assembly building on Saturday.
The food minister said in the presence of All Pakistan Flour Mills’ Association central chairman Mohammad Yousuf Chaudhry that since Oct 15, 2021, the flour mills of the province were being supplied with wheat on a daily basis in accordance with their demand. 
He said that up to 50 per cent of the wheat went to the flour mills in Karachi and the rest to the mills in other districts of the province, while 100,000 tonnes of wheat was apportioned to flour grinding units (chakkis).
He said that fine atta was available at as low a rate as Rs55 per kg, hence there was no crisis of flour availability anywhere in the province from Karachi to Kashmore. 
All commissioners and deputy commissioners had been tasked with supervising movement of the wheat flour trucks from the mills to ensure availability of flour in all areas of the province, he said.
He said that wheat production in Punjab accounted for up to 70 per cent of wheat flour consumption in the country while the rest of the 30 per cent production took place in other provinces. 
The minister said that provincial government had procured 1.2 million tonnes wheat last year to make sure the wheat stocks remained available to the mills at subsidised rates till the last month so as to keep flour prices under control.
Minister for Labour Saeed Ghani held “incompetent” rulers in the centre responsible for “unprecedented” surge in the prices of food items across the country. The prices were definitely to rise when the US dollar’s exchange rate increased to Rs175, petrol price shot up to Rs146 per litre and gas and electricity tariff witnessed unprecedented hike in in the country, he said.
He said the present rulers were so incompetent that one of the federal ministers had the audacity to state on the floor of the National Assembly that he had no idea where 6.6 million tonnes wheat had gone from Punjab.
He said that leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf had unduly claimed that wheat flour was available in Punjab at much cheaper rates than in Sindh although “the cheaper Punjab flour is not fit for human consumption”.
