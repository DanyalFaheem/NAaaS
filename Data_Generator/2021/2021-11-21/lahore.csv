0,"FIA alleges Rs16 billion illegal transactions by Shehbaz, Hamza",Says money laundering investigations against the Sharif group are underway.,"LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) on Saturday claimed to have found Rs16 billion credit transactions through secret bank accounts by PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz, opened in the names of their peons and clerks.
The FIA says the money laundering investigations against the Sharif group are underway.  
“The investigation team under the FIA’s Lahore director has worked very diligently to unwind the financial matrix in this extremely complex case,” FIA Lahore said in a handout issued here on Saturday.
It says the team analysed money trail of over 17,000 credit transactions (worth over Rs16bn) in the secret bank accounts of peons and clerks of the Sharif group (Sharif family) between 2008 and 2018. The investigation team has found “indelible and incontrovertible” documentary evidence of the direct involvement of Shehbaz Sharif, former chief minister, and his son Hamza Shehbaz in the affairs of the Sharif group which had been used as Sharif’s vehicle for money laundering, it claimed.
“Both Shehbaz Sharif and Hamza Shehbaz were holding public offices. They are fully accountable for Rs16bn acquired secretly in the names of their peons and clerks,” it says.
The FIA further says the public position taken by PML-N leader Attaullah Tarar, also a legal adviser to the Sharifs, that the agency has failed to collect evidence of corruption of even a single penny (against Shehbaz and Hamza) is totally “frivolous” and “an attempt to mislead the public at large”. 
In response to the FIA handout, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb said Prime Minister Imran Khan was suffering from ‘Sharif phobia’ for the past many years.  
“Earlier, there was National Accountability Bureau unleashed at the Sharifs and now it is FIA. Imran should be ashamed that his government [could not] prove a single corruption allegation against Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif neither in the UK nor in Pakistan,” she said and added the verdicts by the UK and Pakistani courts were a “slap on the face of the PTI government”.  
Ms Aurangzeb said the NAB had failed to present any evidence against Shehbaz Sharif in the money laundering case during the last three years and now the FIA was following in the bureau’s footsteps.  
“Through this political victimisation, the government cannot mitigate the sufferings it inflicted on the people through price hike, inflation, gas shortage,” she said.

“For the last three years, the people have been suffering from traumas, troubles and sufferings because of one failure after another of this PTI regime. The people are paying the cost of these disasters and indifference by the Imran Khan government. Despite the terminals built by Nawaz Sharif, the gas crisis signified the extreme incompetence of the government. This regime is the only reason behind this crisis because there was a terminal and capacity but the government had failed to provide gas in a timely and reasonable manner. At present less than half of the gas storage capacity in the terminals was being utilised”, Shehbaz said in a statement on Saturday.
He said this situation could have been avoided today if the government had focused on the issues of gas supply and public convenience instead of constantly lying and forcibly passing black laws.  
He said that these crises would only end by getting rid of this government. The people had been thrown helplessly in front of the demons of inflation, unemployment, misery and agony. After the flour and sugar crisis, this gas shortage and inflation were absolute cruelty by this government, he lamented.

4,Fawad blames past rulers for smog in Lahore,Says there was no serious discussion about the country's environment prior to PM Imran.,"GUJRAT: Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain on Saturday lashed out at the past rulers of Punjab for, what he called, causing substantial damage to its capital’s green cover which had adversely affected the air quality in Lahore. 
“We see Lahore engulfed by fog every winter due to the past rulers of the city, who had cut trees for erecting a jungle of concrete there which badly affected green cover of Lahore and its surroundings,” he said while addressing the inaugural ceremony of ‘Green Day Plantation’ in his home town of Jhelum. 
He said before Imran Khan, there was no serious discussion on environment in the country due to a lack of leadership which could stress on forestation and Eco-friendly activities. 
Fawad said it seemed that those who built palatial residences for themselves might have forgotten that they would feel suffocated in those concrete structures without planting trees. 
The minister said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government was the first to popularise the concept of ‘billion tree tsunami’ project when it came into power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Fawad said it was the PM’s vision to leave behind a safe and secure environment for the coming generations as respiratory ailments and deadly disease like cancer were already on the rise because of a lack of focus on environment by the past rulers. 
He said a jungle spanning over 10,500 acres in Jhelum district had been preserved by the present government.  
“We will plant 25,000 trees on 20,000 acres land today (Saturday) here,” he said while asking the audience to clap for around 6,000 students who came to participate in the plantation activity. 
Expressing gratitude to the envoys of different countries for attending the Green Day Plantation, the minister said, “I hope you will be able to tell this beautiful story that how these children actually contributed in a big way towards environment.”
The minister also shed the light on the mega projects carried out by the present government in Jhelum. He said Lillah-Jhelum dual carriageway would soon transform the economy of Jhelum and its adjacent areas. Similarly, he said, Jalalpur Canal project would irrigate 178,000 acres in Jhelum district after its completion.The minister said the agricultural economy and industrial sector got a new boost during the present government’s tenure. 
He said the government was making serious efforts to control inflation which went up in the country due to global inflation.

5,"‘Talibanisation of Afghanistan, KP affected women, children most’",LAHORE: The panelists at the session on ‘the Impact of Talibanisation on Women in Afghanistan and Pakistan’ at...,"LAHORE: The panelists at the session on ‘the Impact of Talibanisation on Women in Afghanistan and Pakistan’ at the Asma Jahangir Conference 2021 on Saturday said a new society had emerged in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Afghanistan where cultural norms had been destroyed in the name of religion.  
The session had Samina Ahmed as its moderator and Sima Samar, Mahbouba Seraj, Shaharzad Akbar, Shagufta Malik, Pashtana Durrani, Farzana Ali and Nader Nadery as panelists. 
Samina Ahmed, the senior adviser at the International Crisis Group, said the humanitarian crises in Afghanistan since the fall of the Ghani government had hit the women and children hard. She said 60pc of the Afghan population was facing critical situation while facing the issues such as displacement, high level of poverty, hunger, violence and absence of the rule of law.   
She termed the Taliban regime a total collapse as the insurgent group had no experience in tackling poverty and governance issues while some problems the regime was facing stemmed from its rigidity. For example, she added, the donors were ready to pay salary to teachers through their bank accounts if the Taliban lifted the ban on girl education. Similarly, cash could come to the health workers accounts if the Taliban allowed women to work but the Taliban only knew resolving problems with guns and not through talks, she lamented.  
Shaharzad Akbar, the chairperson of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, while attending the session online, said the Taliban had not shifted from an insurgency group to a responsible government, which turned the situation dire. She bemoaned that targeted and extrajudicial killings were rampant in Afghanistan and there had been a complete closure of the public space under the Mullahs rule. In the previous years, Ms Akbar added, the women helped raise household income through jobs and businesses but not anymore. She asked Pakistan to play its role for emancipation of the Afghan women.   
It was left to journalist Farzana Ali to recount horrific ordeals of the women of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. She said a mindset had been cultivated under the influence of the Taliban in parts of Pakistan, which devalued women and that mindset did not allow women to work and the girls to get education. She said when she joined journalism in 1997, the biggest hurdles to her work were the social norms while after 2007, religious norms emerged, which not only hindered her work but also put her life at risk. She said she had interviewed the wives of the militants and they were not normal human beings.   
Sima Samar, the former minister of women’s affairs of Afghanistan, said the destruction of education system had wreaked havoc in Afghanistan.  
“This has been done since the invasion of the Russians who tried to impose their own system.”  
Ms Samar said the Taliban rule had reduced the status of women and destroyed human dignity and founding principles.  
Mahbouba Seraj, the founder of the Afghan Women’s Network, said it was sad to see wonderful people were leaving Afghanistan since the inception of the Taliban rule because of fear and anxiety. She asked the neighbouring countries – Iran and Pakistan – to help Afghan people and warned them against using Afghanistan for their strategic benefits.  
Awami National Party MPA Shagufta Malik said that since 2008, girl education had been the main target of the militants in Afghanistan. She said things were so bleak now that a rape victim was told to wear burka to avoid such incidents instead of providing her with justice.

6,"Pre-arrest bail of Shehbaz, Hamza extended",LAHORE: A banking court on Saturday gave last opportunity to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to submit ...,"LAHORE: A banking court on Saturday gave last opportunity to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to submit challan (investigation report) in the money laundering and sugar scam inquiry against Leader of Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza.
Presiding Judge Sardar Tahir Sabir warned the whole prosecution team of show-cause notices in case of further delay in submission of the investigation report. Earlier Shehbaz and Hamza appeared before the court on expiry of their pre-arrest bail in the case.
Asked about the investigation report, the IO of the FIA told the court that an important suspect namely Muhammad Usman had not joined the investigation since he had been released on bail. The judge, however, directed the IO to ensure submission of the report on the next hearing.
Speaking before the court, Shehbaz said he had nothing to do with the affairs of the sugar mills of his sons. He claimed to have not received any income from the mills. He said his decisions as former chief minister caused financial loss to the business of his sons.
He also urged the court to take penal action against the prosecution for not filing the challan within the stipulated time.
The judge asked Shehbaz to file a separate application if he wanted to seek action against the prosecution.
He extended pre-arrest bail of Shehbaz and Hamza till Dec 11 and directed all suspects to join investigation before the FIA.
The FIA had booked Shehbaz and his sons, Hamza and Suleman, in November 2020 under sections 419, 420, 468, 471, 34 and 109 – financial fraud, impersonation and forgery – of the PPC and 5(2) and 5(3) – criminal misconduct – of the Prevention of Corruption Act and r/w 3/4 of the Anti Money Laundering Act.

7,"‘Free media essential to independent judiciary, parliament’",LAHORE: Journalists and activists from India and Pakistan sat together – some virtually – to share their views ...,"LAHORE: Journalists and activists from India and Pakistan sat together – some virtually – to share their views on censorship and lack of freedom of expression in the media in both countries in a session on the first day of the third Asma Jahangir Conference held at a local hotel on Saturday.
Journalist Zarrar Khuhro, who moderated the session, ‘Curtailing freedom of expression by legitimising censorship’, began by mentioning how censorship is much more insidious now and has taken varied forms. When asked, Steven Butler of the Committee to Protect Journalists said censorship is imposed in many ways across Asia through a series of legislation such as anti-terrorism, sedition, national security, cyber crime laws, adding that the ultimate form of censorship was murder.
Christine Chung from the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said the Covid-19 pandemic has exacerbated trends in the region and that violations of the right to freedom of expression extend beyond journalists to human rights defenders and ordinary people protesting government policies. South Asian states are falling short of their duties to protect, respect and fulfil the right to freedom of expression. On the World Press Freedom Index 2021, Pakistan is ranked 145thout of 180 countries, dropping from 142nd. “Free and independent press is essential to a functional democracy,” she stressed.
Journalist Hamid Mir started by condemning the denial of visas to the Indian panelists and Mr Butler. “If [those who refused to issue visas] can’t tolerate these speakers, it’s a sign of their weakness.” He claimed everyone in Pakistan knew media wasn’t free in the country, and quoted the press freedom predators list of the Reporters Without Borders that featured the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers among others.
Mentioning the chief justice of Pakistan’s claim made earlier in the day in another session of the conference that judiciary is free in the country, Mr Mir asked if that was the case then why no justice had been done in the cases of journalists Matiullah Jan, Asad Toor, Absar Alam. He asked the CJP to take suo motu notice on these cases to prove his claim, and also quoted Habib Jalib from 40 years ago about press freedom that he said was still relevant.
“Judiciary isn’t free if the media is not independent and resultantly there’s no democracy. There’s hybrid democracy in Pakistan that’s the biggest threat to the country.”
Here, Mr Khuhro mentioned how it’s silly to censor in the age of technology, adding “the more they try to clamp down, water finds its way”.
Indian journalist Jyoti Malhotra joining online talked about the rampant censorship, clamping down on dissent and freedom of expression across the border, mentioning the cases of comedians jailed for jokes they hadn’t even cracked and journalists booked for merely reporting. Both India and Pakistan will have to listen to their people, she said, addressing those in power in both countries, citing the Kartarpur Corridor as an example of giving in to the will of the people.
Indian activist and lawyer Vrinda Grover talked about how people now are careful about choosing their words carefully so as not to give an opportunity to those waiting to go after someone. “Yet, we must continue to speak our minds and voice our opinions.”
Law has been commissioned to censor speech today, such as sedition law that she called the “most legally repressive measures”, she remarked, adding that free speech for certain kinds of hate speech is rampant.
Indian journalist Barkha Dutt, joining from London, spoke about how she was called both anti-nationalist and jingoist, adding she believed in engagement no matter how much she disagreed with someone’s views. “Censorship, or self-censorship in particular, begins when we feel terrified of differences and feel the need to alter our opinion because we need to mirror that of the opposite side for whatever reason.”

8,Harking back: Need to analyse Lahore’s history in a scientific manner,Such has become our mindset that we have ceased to analyse historical events outside our ‘official’ narrative....,"Such has become our mindset that we have ceased to analyse historical events outside our ‘official’ narrative. Facts no longer matter. As time passes events become more and more bizarre, leading to a situation where we have no idea where our actions are leading to.
To the west of Pakistan a new dispensation has come about, those violent sprinkling exist within our beautiful country. To the east is a country where the majority cleanse Muslim praying places. To think in broader patriotic terms without a communal sprinkling seems impossible. The result is that we have ‘single syllabi’ and admissions have become a major legal minefield what with 1,800 Matric students getting 1,100 out of 1,100 marks. No other place on earth has this ever happened. If that is not a laugh then what else is. Our legislators support such bizarre happenings. Learning is almost a crime in such circumstances.
Let us look at events at Lahore over the centuries keeping in mind our current mindset. Take the Afghan invader Mahmud of Ghazni who invaded our land 17 times and enriched his own land. When he defeated the ruler of Lahore Raja Jayapala at Peshawar in 1001 AD, the proud but defeated Rajput returned home and committed ‘Johar’ - a Rajput ritual of self-immolation - outside Mori Gate where once the River Ravi flowed. Any other self-respecting people would declare him a national hero. Not in present-day Lahore where his faith determines his status.  
But what about the foreign invader? In 1021 the Afghan conquered Lahore and completely flattened it. In the process he removed all the pots and pans of the walled city, killed almost everyone and took as slaves all the young women, men and children he found on his invasion path. In that invasion of 1021 alone he collected 600,000 slaves and sold most of them in faraway markets of Samarkand and even Constantinople (Istanbul). So his interest was in slaves, gold, brass pots and pans, textiles and the entire food stores of Punjab. Yet he is known as a hero among Pakistanis today.  
What this invader did with the temples of the sub-continent (mosques did not exist till then) and their gold and silver idols is another story. Yet it is glossed over with so much praise that it is nothing but self-denial of the truth. Let us consider another two national heroes of Punjab and Lahore and see what we make of them today.
The Mughals were foreign invaders of Mongol origin from Uzbekistan. Today their Arabic-Persian corrupted name for ‘Mongols’ is the Mughals. The greatest among them Akbar (1556-1605) ruled Punjab and Lahore with ruthless vigour. They taxed the poor to such a degree that he faced rebellion in Punjab. That is where we hear the name of Abdullah, better known as Dulla Bhatti. He was duped by the emperor to come for negotiations, but was arrested and skinned alive and for a full one week his skinned body hung from the Lahore Fort’s Akbari Gate. Do we ever consider that aspect of this ‘great’ emperor. But then so were the skinned bodies of his father, uncle and cousins. It was to set an example in barbarity. Do we mourn that today? Not a chance in Hell.
But how do we see Akbar today? He was after all a foreign person who pillaged the poor. The Lahore Fort and the walls of the old city were built by him after a famine broke out. Almost 25,000 starving people of Lahore and its surrounding areas were used as free labour and brick makers for a square meal a day. Yet the ‘Akbarnama’ written in his praise does not mention this atrocity. History needs to be rewritten in terms of what actually happened, and the sources, what to speak of common sense, are all there. After all one day the truth must come forth.
Let us move on to study just how after the death of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb (1658-1707) we see that the Afghans again started invading Punjab and trying to take over Lahore. As we have more sources of this period available we can analyse just who and what were the forces at work. By this time the Punjab and Lahore had a fair mix of Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs. The Sikhs had been persecuted for their anti-establishment role, more so derived from a leadership that believed in all humans being equal.
But the struggle against new Afghan invaders led to a combined patriotic effort to oust all foreign forces. We never study the role of the Marathas who helped the Sukerchakia and Ahluwalia Misls of Punjab in the great ‘1759 Battle of Lahore’ when the Durrani Empire of Afghanistan were roundly beaten and forced to return to their country. Here the Hindu Marathas, the Sikhs of the two major Misls and the Muslim soldiers with both the forces defeated the foreign invaders that the Durranis were.
Even more important is the fact that the Maratha commanders Tukoji Holkar and Sabaji Shinde actually became the rulers of Lahore. How many school and college textbooks tell us this amazing fact? But the best one is that the Muslim and Hindu traders of Lahore, crushed under Afghan taxes and wanton raids on their stocks, actually assisted the patriotic forces of the land. In a way everyone collectively defeated the foreign invaders, and communal feeling did not play a role at all.
For that matter we all know that the Muslim and Hindu traders of Lahore, especially of Arain origin, played a major role in the victory of the Three Sikh Triumvirate rulers in 1766. The three were Lehna Singh Majithia, Gujjar Singh Bhangi and Sobha Singh Kanhiya. These three had led a prolonged guerrilla war against Ahmed Shah Abdali, ultimately defeating the Afghan invader.
Again it was economic exploitation of the people by the Three Sikh rulers that saw the Muslim Arain traders for a second time open the gates of Lahore for Ranjit Singh in 1799. So we have scores of examples where the patriotic forces, surely with their economic interest in mind, worked against foreign invaders. Today in the hearts and minds of the people of Lahore Maharajah Ranjit Singh has a special place because of his fair and equitable non-communal role in the lives of the people of Punjab. For that matter his army had more Muslims than Sikhs (have you ever read about this fact), and they all showed exemplary bravery and loyalty in battle and in affairs of State.
Yet today given the 1947 British imperialist moves to Partition the sub-continent, we have a situation where today the entire sub-continent is increasingly becoming extreme in matters of faith. All it shows is a lack of understanding of the basic facts of our history. In old Lahore toleration was the hallmark of the literate and well-groomed. That is no longer the case.
Take the case of the ‘Lal Khoo’ inside Mochi Gate where Guru Arjan was imprisoned in the house of a Hindu and where the Muslim sage Mian Mir prayed for his release. It is an amazing Lahore cultural landmark. Yet today it has been taken over, and as expected collects money. This needs to be stopped. But then is this possible in the environment of today?

9,Call for defining a child in law by age,LAHORE: The participants in a session on “Role of Children in Family Proceedings” at the third Asma Jahangir...,"LAHORE: The participants in a session on “Role of Children in Family Proceedings” at the third Asma Jahangir Conference said the state should define the age of a child in the laws. 
The session was moderated by Sulema Jahangir and Lahore High Court Justice Jawad Hassan, Circuit Judge and Deputy High Court Judge sitting in the Family Court and Criminal Court in London Justice Sapnara, PML-N MNA Mehnaz Akbar Aziz, and child rights activist Mumtaz Gauhar were present while European Commission for Democracy and Demography vice president Dubravka Suica’s recorded speech was also aired in the session. 
The participants also cut the cake in the session to celebrate the World’s Children Day. 
Ms Suica said the children rights were human rights and on the World Children Day they should remember that all children should enjoy same rights and live a life free of discrimination. She said the European Union’s strategy was renewing its commitment to protect and fulfill the rights of all children across the world. She said the strategy included children’s participation in the child family justice and economic inclusion and protection from all forms of violence. During the pandemic, she added, violence against children had increased and it was the collective responsibility of everyone to protect children from violence. 
Justice Hassan said the laws of the country were favouring mother and child and there were several judgments of the Supreme Court on children and they would have to follow it under the Article 189 of the constitution. 
He said there were several terms being used for children, including minors and child, and he would take them as citizens whose rights were ensured in the constitution. He said as the constitution had defined the rights of citizens under different articles and they would protect children rights as citizens. 
Justice Sapnara said the system was protecting the rights of the children in the UK and highlighted the issue of privacy of children 
She said the journalists might take it against the freedom of expression as the courts would not reveal the identity of children and their families in all types of cases.  
“Now they (journalists) did not reveal names but the media reported about the areas of the child, number of siblings and other things without naming the children themselves and it would result in establishing the identity of the children facing different problems,” she said. 
She said establishing the identity of the children would haunt them their entire life and would create psychological and other issues. She called for the measures to hide the identity of children to the media. 
Child rights activist Gauhar said close family members would be involved in sexual and other abuses in most of the cases of child abuse. 
MNA Aziz said the legislators were not focusing on children and their rights.  
“I have talked to the legislators. Those who are liberal remain silent and the others forcibly try to stop legislation about the minimum age of marriage, etc,” she said.

11,"Judges, lawyers dealing with gender-based violence should be trained: Justice Najafi",LAHORE: Panelists in a discussion stressed how victim blaming in cases of violence against women across South Asia...,"LAHORE: Panelists in a discussion stressed how victim blaming in cases of violence against women across South Asia discourages the survivors from seeking justice.
Speaking on ‘Victim blaming and the Hard Road to Justice’, moderated by activist Usama Khilji, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Saturday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ombudsperson Rakhshanda Naz talked about the many institutional measures she took after assuming office, including sending notices to government department to set up standing inquiry committees for harassment. She mentioned how her team members would mock that women were filing fake cases to avoid working, and how even she was discouraged to perform. Ms Naz also acknowledged the support of the KP government’s secretaries and judiciary for their cooperation.
She said women hesitated to report harassment at the workplace as their families discouraged them, and they faced abuse on social media.
Ambassador of the Netherlands Wouter Plomp discussed how gender-based violence was rampant in many parts of the world, adding that in many cases the survivor knows the perpetrator. He said preventing such cases was vital for which awareness was needed, mentioning a company he visited in Sialkot with a woman-majority workforce where the manager said the best way to deal with harassment was to believe every complainant.
Indian activist Vrinda Grover, joining online, said reforms in laws in South Asia had come about because of women’s movements in the region. The biggest challenge, particularly for sexual harassment, was to make it understood to be a wrong. She said stereotypes about women and a raped woman persisted and often overwhelmed investigating agencies and judicial decisions, adding it’s a challenge to move attention of all stakeholders from the survivor’s character to the conduct of the accused. The myths around sexual violence first re-victimise a woman and deny her right to justice, she stressed.
Lawyer and activist Nighat Dad was of the opinion that it needed to be discussed why women usually don’t speak up: it’s the fear of regressive laws. She then cited various laws and their lack of implementation. Women faced victim-blaming both in on and offline spaces and adding insult to injury was the cyber crime laws whose Section 20 was weaponised against survivors to silence them. After braving pressures from families, online spaces and society when women go to court they face character assassinations by lawyers and courts look on, she lamented. #MeToo started because survivors gave up, so there’s a need to look within what the judiciary, lawyers, and policymakers are doing, Ms Dad stressed.
Justice Ali Baqar Najafi admitted there needs to be a different approach for a victim by judges and lawyers. It was encouraging that at least there was law in place and discussion could take place about violence, people know complaints could be filed. But every member of society would need to come together to fight violence against women; judges and lawyers dealing with such cases needed to be trained and these cases fast-tracked. A survivor also needed to be provided a comfortable environment in court to narrate her story without any pressure, the judge maintained. Sheharyar Rizwan

12,Kashmiris feel bypassed by bilateralism,Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chief spokesperson Rafiq Dar says India is following the policy of...,"Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chief spokesperson Rafiq Dar says India is following the policy of disintegration of the parts of Kashmir by bifurcating Ladakh from the state and by annexing Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) with its territory, Pakistan is doing the same.  
“Pakistan should integrate GB with Azad Kashmir. It can be a one unit or GB can be given a similar set-up as AJK with both parts having a joint independent council, comprising nominees from both the parts and that council should be empowered to take up the Kashmir case at the international level,” he suggested while addressing a session titled “Conflict in Kashmir: Bypassing Kashmiris” during the Asma Jahangir Conference at a hotel here on Saturday.  
Mr Dar pointed out that the Kashmir Question was reduced to the India-Pakistan bilateral issue in Tashkent, Shimla Agreement, Lahore Declaration and Islamabad Declaration and these bilateral agreements between India and Pakistan bypassed Kashmiris.  
“The presence of Kashmiri leadership, the principal party, was missing there and that’s the reason for the failure of bilateralism until now,” he declared. 
The UN Missions used to come to Kashmir for assessing the situation but after these bilateral agreements, these mission stopped visiting to Kashmir, Mr Dar continued. He stressed that Kashmir was not a territorial dispute between India and Pakistan and every Kashmiri stood for total independence, reunification of the divided parts of Kashmir and sovereignty. He condemned the extrajudicial killings of Kashmiris by the Indian forces. The UN sought both India and Pakistan against going any territorial change in the parts of the state that both countries administered by India in 2019 tried to change the status quo and we expected Pakistan to respond vehemently to this Indian move. He demanded a dialogue between India, Pakistan and Kashmiris.  
Journalist Nasim Zehra rejected the statement of Mr Dar that Pakistan was integrating any part of Kashmir by making it a part of its own territory. She was confronted by a Kashmiri youth from the audience over her claim, but reiterated that Pakistan had done whatever maximum it could have done for Kashmir. She said the Kashmiris were always taken into confidence and during the Nawaz Sharif era, Yasin Malik remained in Pakistan for 10 days for consultations while Pakistan also consulted Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.  
Ms Zehra added that atrocities being committed to Kashmiris in held Kashmir by India were unprecedented. She talked about the genocide of Kashmiris even before the Partition of India, adding that the Kashmiris remained steadfast in their struggle for freedom.  
Journalist from India held Kashmir Syed Iftikhar Gilani, through the help of slides, gave the facts and figures of demography and population of the held Kashmir. While giving figures, he presented the current situation in the held Kashmir and how India was trying to change the situation by imposing its rule and bringing the officials and bureaucrats from outside Kashmir to rule over the Kashmiris.  
He said Ladakh was generally considered a Hindu majority region which was factually wrong. He said Kashmir has been ruled by outsiders since the Mughal era centuries back.  
Kashmiri journalist Naial Altaf Kayani said the Kashmiris had been bypassed, not only by those outside it but also by their own leaders in Azad Jammu and Kashmir as well as the United Nations. Referring to the Indus Basin Treaty, she said the right to the resources of the land rested with the Kashmiris only but Pakistan, by signing this treaty, admitted that the held Kashmir and its rivers were the legal part of India. “The Kashmiris were also bypassed when Sheikh Abdullah traded the right to self-determination with inclusion of 35-A in the Article 370 of Indian constitution.”  
Ms Kayani urged Pakistan to think beyond rhetoric, keeping in view the onslaught of RSS and BJP and in the held Kashmir. She demanded that ongoing war crimes in the held Kashmir must be tried under the international laws and urged Pakistan to move petitions in the UN as well as International Court of Justice over India’s war crimes in Kashmir.  
Tariq Naqash, the correspondent of Dawn in Kashmir, who also moderated the session, said discussing what Pakistan could not do or did not do would be akin to crying over the spilt milk. He added that only appreciation of the sacrifices given by Kashmiris in their freedom struggle also did not serve any purpose. He raised the questions of how things could move forward when Narendra Modi was ruling in India and Pakistan government was bereft of any fresh ideas. He suggested that Kashmiris should be given a leading role for finding solutions to their issues.

18,PTI to end outdated system thru’ EVMs: Qureshi,MULTAN: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi says the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) wants to strengthen democracy...,"MULTAN: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi says the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) wants to strengthen democracy and end the outdated system by using the electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the upcoming general elections. 
Addressing different ceremonies in various union councils of NA-156 on Saturday, he said the PTI government was trying to use the modern technology to make the future elections fair where no political party might level the allegations of rigging.  
“By holding the next elections while using the EVMs, we want to end the word ‘rigging’ forever,” he claimed. 
He said the overseas Pakistanis were the backbone of the country’s economy and asked why they were not allowed to cast votes if they were sending billions of rupees to the country.  
“Is giving the right to vote to the overseas Pakistanis a wrong step? Voting is their fundamental right from which they were being deprived. The overseas Pakistanis wanted to participate in the electoral process. They want betterment of Pakistan,” he explained. 
Mr Qureshi added that elimination of corruption, provision of justice and good governance were possible only if democracy was strengthened in the country while democracy could only be strengthened if all Pakistanis whether living in or out of the Pakistan had a right to vote. He said the PTI had made history by giving the right to vote to the overseas Pakistanis.  
About the differences of the opposition parties on the move, the minister said the opposition always opposed every good step taken by the government.  
“The opposition becomes united against all the steps, including the legislation, made by the government despite the fact it has differences within its own ranks. The successful legislation over the issues of giving right to vote to the overseas Pakistanis and the EVMs is a proof that there is a unity within the government’s ranks while there is disruption among the ranks of opposition,” he claimed.  
He said the government was facing multiple challenges since it came into power.  
“The rulers during the tenures of the previous governments looted the national exchequer ruthlessly whose consequences are being faced by the nation.”  
Mr Qureshi said the PTI government was making all-out efforts to overcome inflation, which was the biggest challenge.  
He said the PTI government also gave the gift of south Punjab Secretariat through which the people of this area would not have to travel to other districts for resolution of their issues.  
“The development of south Punjab is the priority of our government, which wants to divert the development process from the urban areas to the rural areas,” the minister said and added that the development schemes worth of billions were underway in Multan.
