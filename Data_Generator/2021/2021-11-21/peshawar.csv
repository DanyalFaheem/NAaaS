Addressing a protest rally here, the alliance chief said the opposition would respect the army if the latter was neutral.
“We don’t want a state institution like the army to be discussed in public meetings, but it depends on your [establishment’s] actions,” he said.
The multiparty opposition alliance held a public rally on the Ring Road against the rising rates of essential commodities, fuel and utility bills. The police cordoned off all routes to the provincial secretariat of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, where the PDM leaders addressed workers.
According to analysts, the PDM’s power show in the provincial capital like the past and the participation of workers was also very thin.

PDM chief addresses rally in Peshawar, insists PM ‘irrelevant’ in national politics

Former prime minister and PML-N leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao and others addressed the rally.
Mr Fazl came down heavily on the establishment for ‘open intervention in politics’ and said parliament had become a toy in the hands of the power that be after the government rushed bills through the joint session of parliament.
He said parliamentarians of the ruling PTI and its allies were pressured to attend the joint session and vote for the government’s bills.
The PDM chief said members of the opposition parties also received phone calls and were threatened not to attend the joint session. He said the opposition parliamentarians were warned that corruption cases would be registered against them if they attended the joint sitting.
“We are watching your (establishment) mischievous role in politics,” he said.
Mr Fazl said the establishment should withdraw its support for the ‘puppet’ PTI government if it wanted to serve the country in a ‘dignified manner’.
He said Prime Minister Imran Khan had become irrelevant in national politics and a ‘curse’ had been imposed on the nation through rigged elections.
The PDM chief said parliament had passed bills in its joint session to establish the hold of the International Monetary Fund on the country’s fiscal system and tighten the role of establishment in politics.
He said a bill was passed to benefit Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was involved in the killing of Pakistani soldiers and innocent civilians.
Without naming the PPP, the PDM chief said the joint session of parliament had exposed the people, who wanted to bring about an in-house change.
He said the opposition would be at the mercy of the establishment and taste defeatif no confidence motion was moved against the prime minister.
Addressing the rally, former prime minister and PML-N leader Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the government wanted to hold next elections through electronic voting machine (EVM) to steal the people’s mandate.
He said the next government would revoke the bills passed by the joint session of parliament.
Mr Abbasi said the country’s former top judge was allegedly involved in election rigging and that the recent scandal related to judiciary had created doubts about the country’s justice system.
He said the country would never make progress without following the Constitution.
Qaumi Watan Party chairman Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao rejected the use of EVMs in the next general elections and said the PTI government was planning to rig the next polls through those machines.
He said the PTI government knew it would suffer a crushing defeat in the next elections for breaking its all promises.
Mr Sherpao said there was a growing sense of resentment and despondency among have-nots, who had been exposed to record inflation by the rulers.
He said all segments of society, including youth, were disenchanted with the government. The QWP chairman said the PDM wanted free and fair elections in the country to enable the people to send their true representatives to the assemblies.
“We will not allow interference in the electoral process. We are committed to upholding the Constitution and democratic values in the country,” he said.
Mr Sherpao said the PM Imran Khan-led government had failed on all fronts.
He said the PDM would continue its struggle against the inefficient rulers for their early ouster.
The QWP chairman claimed that the PTI came to power through rigged elections.

5,Over 40 entomologists recruited to stem dengue spread,Seventy-seven more people test positive for fever in province...,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health department has recruited 41 entomologists on regular basis to check dengue transmission in the province by containing the production of the mosquitoes carrying and spreading the virus.
Eighteen entomologists are already working in the department on ad hoc basis, health officials told Dawn.
The officials said the regular recruitment of entomologists would ensure the sustainable control of dengue outbreaks.
They said the department had already deployed four ad hoc entomologists in Peshawar district, which was worst hit by dengue fever in the province.
The development comes amid high dengue incidence in the province.

Seventy-seven more people test positive for fever in province

On Saturday, 77 more residents tested positive for dengue increasing the province’s tally of the fever to 9,969 since its outbreak three months ago.
Of them, 50 were reported in Peshawar, according to a report of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response System of the health department.
A total of 107 patients recovered from the fever during the last 24 hours in the province, while the active cases totalled 169.
The provincial capital has so far recorded 52.74 per cent of the province’s dengue cases i.e. 5,258.
Adil Shah, a Peshawar-based entomologist working with the health department, told Dawn that dengue control could be possible only if it was properly planned in March.
He said the initial dengue cases should be isolated as the mosquitoes took the virus by biting infected person before transmitting it to others.
The expert said patients should be given impregnated bed nets for protection from mosquito bites.
He said the quick response to the first two to five cases could have averted the current dengue outbreak.
“The first 90 dengue cases reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa came from Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad, which were worst hit by the fever in the country. Previously, there’s no local infection, but as the mosquito population grew, the infection spread fast,” he said.
Mr Adil said the entomologist’s intervention would ensure indoor and outdoor larva surveillance for the elimination of puddles, fogging, and use of larvicides.
He said the health department was likely to establish a full-fledged setup for dengue control and strengthen entomologists by giving them resources such as transports and human resources.
“The dengue-related situation in the coming years will be totally different from the past,” he said. The expert said the dropping mercury would cause the dengue cases to decline as most mosquitoes didn’t survive at the temperature below 12 Celsius.
“The dengue virus thrives in clean water often stored in open pots and drums, so we [authorities] should ensure that the people get regular water supply to remove the need for its storage,” he said.
Mr Adil said Peshawar had mosquitoes in large numbers, so it recorded more dengue cases compared with other districts.
Meanwhile, the health officials said a lack of coordination among government departments was affecting the campaign against dengue.
They told Dawn that the people required regular water and electric supply, and clean environment, which was not the domain of the health department.
The officials said the people couldn’t be completely blamed for water storage, which was the main source of mosquito breeding, and that coordination among the relevant departments was a precondition for the elimination of mosquitoes.
They said the campaign against dengue in the province was affected due to involvement of most health workers in the activities and campaigns against novel coronavirus and measles.

Deputy chief of the CPWC Ijaz Mohammad Khan said Pakistan had signed and ratified the United Nation Convention on the Rights of the child and committed itself to protecting its children from all kinds of abuse.
He said it was the provincial government’s responsibility to improve the child protection mechanism and introduce laws, rules and regulations to protect children from violence, abuse and exploitation.
Mr Ijaz said the government enacted the child protection law in 2010 leading to the establishment of the provincial child protection and welfare commission.
“The commission established 12 child protection units at district level initiating a mechanism for child protection at provincial, district and community levels,” he said. The CPWC deputy chief said the CEWC also identified 30,474 cases, including 18,808 boys and 11,659 girls, besides seven transgender children at risk.
Executive director of the Group Development Pakistan Saima Qadeer said a lot had been done by Pakistan including adoption of many laws for child protection. She said the implementation of laws related to children was direly needed. Ms Saima said it was heartening to see eight of 13 child courts established in KP.

8,Parasitic fruit fly damaging guava in Kohat orchards,Official identifies areas where crop has been affected.,"KOHAT: The city’s famous guava orchards spread over about 1,700 acres have been damaged by a common parasitic fruit fly, resulting in big financial losses to the local farmers. 
When contacted, director agriculture Zahir Ullah Khattak said that the crop had been affected in areas, including Nasratkhel, Kaghazai, Mohammadzai, Shahpur, Jarwanda, Chakarkot, Garhijaat near Kohat Toi and in orchards located near Hangu and Bannu bypasses and Rawalpindi Road. 
He said the major reason for the damage was the transfer of flies from unsprayed orchards to the sprayed ones. He said he had been inviting the orchard owners for a meeting to distribute pumps and pesticide swabs for hanging so that all the orchards could be sprayed at a time, but they did not cooperate. 
He said when the fly stung the fruit the eggs inside it became worms after completing the 21-day cycle, meaning the orchard affected in September would give fruit full with worms in October and so on. He said spraying the orchards at a time was the permanent remedy. 

Official identifies areas where crop has been affected

Mr Khattak said they used to send the report of damage to their headquarters in Peshawar in such cases, but the farmers were never helped. He said most of the guava trees crossed their age limit of 40 years and had lost resistance to diseases.

Syed Sajjad Zeb, an elder, said they had long been informing the authorities concerned to replace the loosely hanging transmission cables and the rusted poles, but to no avail. “Wooden crossings (overlaps) on the pylons have long completed their lifespan and need to be replaced immediately to avoid any mishap,” he warned.
Gul Dad Khan, general secretary of the traders’ union, Bisham, said there was no proper mechanism for repair and maintenance of the transmission line. 
He said the local people had highlighted the issue at different forums, but Pesco did not take any corrective measures.
Sharafat Ali, a social activist, said an untoward incident could happen anytime if the rusted pylons and their crossings were not changed immediately.
Meanwhile, sources in the Pesco agreed that power supply infrastructure in Shangla needed to be overhauled as there had been no major maintenance on the main transmission line since its laying in early 90s.
They acknowledged that pylons were rusted, wooden crosses (overlaps) had broken down and electricity cables had become obsolete. 
They said 95 per cent of crossings on pylons were in severely poor condition, thus posing a risk to people’s lives. 
They said strong winds often knocked down pylons, suspending power supply.
When contacted, Rehmat Wali, an official in the Pesco subdivision Bisham, told Dawn that they had submitted demands for provision of new pylons and other equipment to overhaul the transmission line.
Meanwhile, an eight-year-old girl died after she fell from a bridge in Bisham while returning from school the other day.
A teacher of her school told reporters that Maryam Bibi was returning home from school when she fell from the bridge near her house.

He expressed these views while inaugurating work on the construction of a new road in Awanabad village of Tajik union council on Saturday. 
The project would be completed at a cost of Rs8 million during the current fiscal year.
Mr Aslam said with 43pc of the airborne emissions in the country coming from the transport sector, transition to electric vehicles would provide a huge opportunity to reduce air pollution.
He said the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Plantation and clean energy projects were acknowledged during the UN-led global climate summit (COP26).
He said Pakistan was awarded with Forestry Champion by the UN and Nature Leader award by UK at the summit.
He said though there were issues including inflation in Pakistan but it was also a fact that the PTI government under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan was taking practical steps to rid the nation of these problems.
“There are dozens of government’s programmes including Ehsaas Programme, Kamyab Jawan Programme, Insaf Health Card, and Ehsaas Scholarship through which efforts are being made to eradicate poverty and unemployment and people are also getting relief,” he added.
He said the government was striving hard to resolve public issues on a priority. Development projects have been initiated by the government to facilitate the masses. There is inflation not only in Pakistan but across the world and it would be controlled soon. 
He urged the masses to get themselves registered with Ehsaas Programme to get relief. 
He said heavy debt, corruption and expensive electricity contracts given by previous governments were one of the major causes of inflation.
Mr Aslam said work on the construction of 12-km-long Bhatiot Boota road had been started which will directly benefit thousands of residents of Attock and seven villages of Jand. 
He said the road project which was put on the back burner for many years was launched in a bid to provide better traveling facilities to the local people. It will reduce the distance of these villages from the Attock district headquarters by 40km.
He said at present the residents of these villages have to cover 80 to 100 km distance to reach Attock but after the completion of the road the distance will reduce by up to 50pc.
Mr Amin said the road will also benefit other areas of Jand and Pindigheb besides generating economic activities.
He said steps were being taken to meet the paucity of teachers at Government Shuja Khanzada Shaheed College Hazro. Besides, work was being carried out on a water supply scheme for the area at a cost of Rs2.5 million.
