ISLAMABAD: With gas shortfall estimated to peak closer to one billion cubic feet per day in January, the ministry of energy on Thursday reported the power sector circular debt at Rs2.419 trillion at the end of October, rising at the rate of about Rs35 billion per month.
This was the crux of a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Energy (CCoE) presided over by Minister for Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives Asad Umar.
An official statement said the petroleum division of the energy ministry presented projected natural gas supply and different policy options for the management of gas supply from the management side for the winter months — December 2021 through March 2022.
The meeting was informed about the efforts to enhance the natural gas supply. The CCoE directed the petroleum division to ensure maximum supply while ensuring implementation of a demand management plan as already approved by the Cabinet.

Non-export general industry to be provided gas on the basis of weekly rotation

After analysis of demand and supply situation, including domestic gas production and LNG imports, the overall gas shortage in December was estimated at about 720 million cubic feet per day peaking to 970mmcfd in January and the coming down to 640mmcfd in February. To overcome the shortfall in energy supply chain, particularly in the power sector, the furnace oil requirement was estimated about 170,000 tonnes in December, 150,000 tonnes in January and about 55,000 tonnes in February. The meeting was informed that furnace oil availability in December would be around 140,000 tonnes and 90,000 tonnes in January and over 130,000 tonnes in February. That meant some power shortages could also be expected depending on demand growth as a result of cheaper seasonal and industrial support tariff.
It was decided that gas and RLNG would be supplied uninterrupted to export industry, including top 50 exporters, in addition to zero-rated industry, unless technical constraints emerge in the system like pressure problems. Supply of gas and RLNG to export-oriented captive power plants would be monitored till December 15 and then re-adjusted based on availability. CNG would remain closed until February 15.
The general industry (non-export) would be provided gas on the basis of weekly rotation, with one-day off, for each sector or zone. The cement sector would be treated on par with non-export general industry and complete closure would depend on supply review. Uninterrupted gas supply of about 757mmcfd would continue to the fertiliser sector to boost agriculture productivity. Fauji Fertiliser and Fauji bin Qasim would get 330mmcfd, Engro 203mmcfd, Fatima 147mmcfd, Pakarab 49mmcfd and Agritech 29mmcfd.
The power sector IPPs on dedicated arrangements worth 3,000mw would get uninterrupted gas supply but then these are based on non-pipeline quality gas which could not be transported. LNG-based power plants would be provided 5 per cent extra supply as compared to last year’s actual consumption.
It was decided that after meeting national requirements of gas for critical industries, “maximum efforts would be made to accommodate the domestic consumers on priority” and in case of extreme winter, gas curtailed from CNG, cement, general industry (non export) and captive plants of export industry would be diverted to domestic sector to ease political noise.
For space and water heating, the domestic consumers were being encouraged to fully utilise the seasonal electricity tariff of Rs12.96 per unit. Also, electricity package for export industry at the rate of 9 cents per unit had already been provided while gas tariff for export sector (captive plants) has been increased from $6.5 per million British Thermal Unit (MMBTU) to $9 to switch industry from gas to power grid.

1,Dollar hits new high amid depleting SBP reserves,Well-informed analysts and brokerage houses are of the view that the dollar will soon touch the mark of Rs180.,"

KARACHI: The US dollar has appreciated further to set a new record while foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) have been declining on a weekly basis.
The dollar closed at Rs176.42 on Thursday as it gained 94 paisa.
Well-informed analysts and brokerage houses are of the view that the dollar would soon touch the mark of Rs180, indicating that the decline in foreign exchange reserves coupled with higher inflation would continue to devalue the purchasing power of the local currency.
The rupee has been losing value against the US dollar despite successful negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and reports about possible release of $3 billion from the Saudi Fund.
However, the country has yet to receive funds from these sources. Pakistan has also announced plans to launch Sukuk bonds to raise $1bn.
Currency experts believe the $20bn trade deficit is enough to keep pressure on the local currency.
The demand for the greenback has remained high since the beginning of the current financial year. Since July the US dollar appreciated by 12 per cent or Rs18.88 against the local currency.
The central bank reported on Thursday that the foreign exchange reserves fell by $244 million to $16.010bn during the week that ended on Nov 26. The SBP did not offer any reason for the decline but experts believe it was due to debt repayment.
The central bank has been facing a fast decrease in the reserves since it was at its peak with over $20bn in August this year.
The holdings of the commercial banks were $6.488bn while the country’s total stood at $22.498bn.
Currency experts and bankers said the remittances have been declining as reflected from the amount in October. Compared to Sept, inflows were short by about $200m.
Bankers said if the remittances did not improve, it would badly damage the government’s plan to deal with the growing problem on external front of the economy.
The government expected to net about $32bn as remittances in the current financial year, but the trend is not positive. With rising trade deficit and low remittances, the current account deficit would be the biggest problem for the country and will hit the exchange rate hard.
The US dollar would take advantage of the situation to further pressure the rupee.

2,E-commerce university being set up: PM aide,SAPM Aon Abbas Buppi says the proposed university will enhance the capabilities of e-commerce traders in Pakistan.,"ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on E-Commerce Senator Aon Abbas Buppi has said the government will soon lay the foundation of Pakistan’s first e-commerce university.
While presiding over the National E-Commerce Symposium organised by the Ministry of Commerce on Thursday, he said the proposed university would enhance the capabilities of e-commerce traders not only in Pakistan but also in the emerging international market.
Mr Buppi said most of the e-commerce business was being done by the youths and the government would provide them all facilities.
He said the e-commerce university would provide employment opportunities to the youths and Pakistan would become a part of the global supply chain which would enhance the country’s economic strength.
He said Prime Minister Imran Khan had high hopes from the youths and now mostly young people were in e-commerce trading, which could increase the country’s exports.
The special assistant said the government was also planning to create the first e-commerce web portal, which would help in curbing illegal trade.
He said with the help of Chinese company Alibaba, an e-commerce portal would be created and transparency would be brought in this sector.
Mr Buppi said the government had planned to increase e-commerce trade volume to $9 billion by June 2023. “There are conflicting figures in Pakistan’s e-commerce trade, however, with the current trade of $4.5bn, we can take it to $9bn. I will take care of all the issues of e-commerce traders, including State Bank of Pakistan and other tax agencies,” he said.
The special assistant said the most of the issues were related to finance, taxes, logistics data and ‘Ease of Doing Business’ of which the government was aware and would pay full attention to them.

3,Cut-off yields on T-bills increased by up to 229bps,Market experts see further hike in the interest rate due to mounting inflationary pressures.,"KARACHI: Cut-off yields on market treasury bills were increased by up to 229 basis points in the first auction held on Wednesday after the interest rate hike on Nov 19.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday announced that the government raised Rs504.33 billion through T-bills auction against the target of Rs740bn. It also raised Rs22.5bn through non-competitive bids.
The big jump of 229bps in cut-off yields was expected because the central bank had already raised its policy rate by 1.5 per cent to 8.75pc, which initially jolted the market, but the double-digit (11.5pc) rise in CPI-based inflation for November justified the major hike in the interest rate.
The major hike in the cut-off yields took place after over a year. The SBP had cut the interest rate from 13.25pc to 7pc within three months after Covid emergency in March 2020 and held it unchanged for over a year to support the economy besides injecting in massive liquidity to achieve growth.
Market experts see further hike in the interest rate due to mounting inflationary pressures.
The SBP reported that the cut-off yield for three-month T-bills was increased by 229bps to 10.79pc. The government raised Rs338.33bn for this tenor.
The six-month T-bills yield was incre­ased to 11.5pc while the government raised Rs110.9bn. The cut-off yield for 12-month papers was increased to 11.51pc and Rs55bn was raised.
However, some economists and analysts believe that the decision resulted into now increasing inflation as the currency in circulation is more than 25pc of the total supply. During the current fiscal year, the benchmark six-month T-bills rate was increased by 397bps from 7.53pc on July 14 to 11.50pc on Wednesday.Similarly, the rate on three-month T-bills was increased by 354bps to 10.79pc during the current fiscal year.
The government also raised Rs28.8bn through auction of Pakistan Investment Bonds as it raised Rs11.75bn for two years and Rs10bn for five-year while Rs7.111bn was raised as non-competitive bids.
Meanwhile, the SBP clarified in a late-night message in response to some media reports that the date of the next MPC is not being brought forward. The MPC meeting, it added, is scheduled to take place on Dec 14 — as announced previously.

4,"Attock Refi­nery Limited slams furnace oil imports, warns of shutdown",Reports suggest other refineries have also warned the govt about imminent shutdowns which could lead to fuel shortages.,"ISLAMABAD: Protesting over furnace oil imports ins­tead of procurement from local refineries, Attock Refi­nery Limited (ARL) on Thursday expressed its inability to increase kerosene production and warned of gradual closure of its refining units owing to surplus stocks.
In a letter to the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Divi­sion), ARL Chief Executive Officer Adil Khattak lam­ented that despite his warnings over the last two weeks, there was no improvement in the uptake of light and high sulphur furnace oil (LSFO/HSFO) from the refinery. Consequently, the furnace oil inventory at ARL — the country’s oldest and only refinery in the north — has increased manifold with hardly 8-10 days of storage capacity left.
“With no improvement in Furnace Fuel Oil (FFO) despatches, we are left with no option except to curtail our refinery throughput. In case there is no improvement in upliftment of FFO in next few days, we will be forced to shut down our distillation units one by one ultimately leading to total shutdown of the refinery,” the letter read.
The CEO said the company was surprised to note that huge volumes of FFO had been and was being imported on one hand and on the other hand the fuel from local refineries was not being uplifted.
“The IPPs which are bound by their agreements to maintain FFO inventory for thirty days are also not being pushed by the regulatory authorities to lift from local refineries,” Mr Khattak complained.
On the other hand, he said that at a time when refineries were heading towards shutdown, the Petroleum Division had asked local refineries on November 30 to increase production of kerosene oil as the country was left with only 10 days of stocks.
“The above situation points towards lack of planning and coordination rather disconnect between various sections of the government,” read the letter.
The ARL executive also pointed out that state-run Kot Addu Power Company (Kapco) had sufficient storage capacity to cater for ARL’s LSFO which should be utilised so that ARL can operate at optimum throughput and provide the committed volumes of POL products in its supply envelope.
With a view to sustain the entire crude oil supply chain and associated gas supplies from the oil fields, the ARL strongly demanded of the Petroleum Division for urgent intervention in giving directions to Pakistan State Oil, Kapco and other oil marketing companies for resuming supplies from ARL to ensure the refinery is able to operate “uninterruptedly”, failing which a complete refinery shutdown is imminent, Mr Khattak warned.
Reports suggest the other refineries have also warned the federal government about imminent shutdowns which could lead to petrol, high-speed diesel and jet fuel shortages.

5,KE allowed Rs1.08 per unit additional fuel cost for October,Utility told to resolve gas supply issues.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday allowed K-Electric (KE) to charge about Rs1.08 per unit additional fuel cost on account of electricity consumed in October.
The Nepra hearing – presided over by its Chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui – held a public hearing on KE’s petition on Fuel Charges Adjustments (FCA) for the month of October seeking an increase of Rs1.38 per unit.
Originally, KE had filed the FCA request for 29 paisa per unit increase on November 12 to generate Rs516 million additional funds from its consumers. The utility reported that its request was based on the Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA)’s rate fuel cost of September i.e. Rs7.4052 per unit which was the latest available rate at the time of filing of petition.

Utility told to resolve gas supply issues

However, during the hearing, KE requested to increase the demanded FCA to Rs1.38 per unit instead of 29 paisa per unit. The impact of the increase was estimated at Rs2.46bn on KE consumers.
Citing the reason for increased FCA, KE has taken the plea that the regulator had conducted a public hearing for CPPA request for additional FCA to ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) for October on November 30 during which the rate presented (for October 2021) was Rs9.9165 per unit.
Considering significant difference in both rates and its impact on KE’s FCA, the company’s revised its request to Rs1.38 per unit. The Nepra tentatively finalised additional FCA at Rs1.08 but said certain documents and data were subject to verification and would be confirmed through a written determination.
A KE official explained that this increase was mainly due to a surge in prices of furnace oil, regasified liquefied natural gas and CPPA prices by seven per cent, 5pc and 31pc, respectively. Considering significant variation in CPPA rate and its impact on KE’s fuel cost, the utility has submitted revised monthly cost variation for the month of October.
The regulator’s case officers said that after various adjustments, the increase under monthly FCA will be around Rs1.08 per unit. The increase will have a financial impact of Rs1.9bn, he said.

6,Imports of 30 items surge 142pc in November,Govt blames high global prices for the massive rise in import bill.,"

ISLAMABAD: Finance Adviser Shaukat Tarin is chairing a meeting on balance of trade on Thursday.—PPI

 
ISLAMABAD: Imports of top 30 items surged by over 142 per cent year-on-year in November due to higher prices of commodities mainly petroleum on international market and depreciation of the rupee, a senior official told Dawn.
The import bill of energy, steel and industrial raw materials posted growth, while high import of vaccines also contributed significantly to the rise in the November import bill from a year ago.
The total import value of these 30 products in Nove­mber reached Rs696.346bn from Rs287.131bn over the corresponding month of last year, registering a growth of 142.52pc.
The share of these products in total imports stood at over 53pc.

Govt blames high global prices for massive rise

The country’s overall imports also rose by 98pc to Rs1.362 trillion in Nove­mber against Rs686bn in the corresponding month last year.
In the top 30 imports items, the major contribution came from motor spirit (petrol) which increased by 279.54pc to Rs102.697bn in November from Rs27.058bn last year, followed by petroleum and oils obtained from bitumen by 131.76pc to Rs75.455bn and high-speed diesel 266.39pc to Rs57.234bn against Rs15.621bn over the last year.
The import of LNG also went up by 101.94pc to Rs72.372bn against Rs35.837bn over last year. The increase in LNG prices coupled with the massive depreciation of the rupee increased its import cost in November.
The import of bituminous coal also increased by 120.36pc to Rs41.339bn against Rs18.760bn over the last year. Coal is used in multiple industries including steel, electricity etc. A massive increase was seen in the import value of palm oil and palm olein.
The import value of palm oil increased to Rs33.611bn in November from Rs11.788bn last year, a growth of 185.12pc while import of palm olein edged up by 60.74pc to Rs29.056bn from Rs18.076bn last year.
In November, the government spent Rs31.482bn on the import of vaccines against Rs3.602bn last year. The vaccines were imported to vaccinate people against Covid-19 while the focus of the drive was shifted to schools with children aged 12 years and above.
The government imported sugar worth Rs12.654bn in November against Rs4.098bn over last year, indicating a growth of 208pc. The import of phosphoric acid surged by 8,509pc to Rs14.995bn this year against Rs174.18m over the last year.
The import of wind-powered machinery equipment stood at Rs7.349bn against no import over the corresponding month of last year.
The import of furnace oil posted growth of 243pc to Rs6.457bn in November for power generation against Rs1.881bn last year. This massive increase is because of LNG shortfall in the country.
Similarly, the import of vehicles in CKD/SKD conditions reached Rs30.152bn in November from Rs7.878bn over the corresponding month last year, an increase of 282.7pc.
The LPG import also witnessed an increase of 78.63pc to Rs9.320bn against Rs5.217bn over the last year. A massive increase was noted in imports of raw materials and chemicals used in several industries.
Meanwhile, Finance Adviser Shaukat Tarin chaired a meeting to review and discuss the import bill for the first five months (July-November) of 2021-22.
The meeting was infor­med that the pressure on import bill was mainly due to global high commodity prices especially energy, steel, and industrial raw materials.
The forum also noted that high import of vaccines contributed significantly to the rise in import bill.
Moreover, it was informed that there will be less import of food items, furnace oil and vaccine in the coming months that will significantly reduce the pressure on trade bill in the second half of the current fiscal year.
Mr Tarin directed authorities to take effective policy measures to reduce unnecessary imports of luxury items.
National Food Security Minister Fakhar Imam, Industries and Production Minister Khusro Bakhtiar, Energy Minister Hammad Azhar, Commerce Adviser Abdul Razak Dawood, and federal secretaries attended the meeting.
