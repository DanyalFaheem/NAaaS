1,Joint opposition to boycott house committee on security,PML-N leader says the decision has been made after mutual consultation.,"ISLAMABAD: The joint opposition in parliament on Thursday announced that it would boycott the upcoming meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security (PCNS) convened by National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser for a “presentation” by National Security Adviser (NSA) Dr Moeed Yusuf on the government’s national security policy.
According to Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb, the decision has been made by the opposition parties after mutual consultations.
The speaker has convened the PCNS meeting on the one-point agenda on Dec 6, inviting all 29 members of the committee, including Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, for discussion.
Besides 29 members of the committee, the speaker has also issued special invitations to 22 others, including the four chief ministers and other senior officials of the ministries of foreign affairs, interior, defence and finance.

PML-N leader says the decision has been made after mutual consultation

In a statement issued here on Thursday, Ms Aurangzeb said that the joint opposition had made the decision to boycott the in-camera meeting of the PCNS due to the government’s attitude of bulldozing important draft bills in the recently-held joint sitting of parliament and its “persistent authoritarian approach” on important constitutional, legal, national and security issues.
She said the united opposition had informed the government about the decision.
The joint opposition stated that the opposition parties had always shown very responsible and serious attitude on all issues relating to the Constitution, national security and public importance.
It said that despite the absence of Prime Minister Imran Khan and “his complete detachment from important national and public issues”, the opposition parties had not only fully participated in the previous briefings and meetings convened on national security, but the top leadership of the united opposition also gave their valuable suggestions.
“All parties of the joint opposition have a very mature vision, extensive experience and seriousness on critical issues related to the Constitution, the country and the people,” said the statement, adding that in the past too, they always played a historic role in safeguarding and promoting the rights and interests of the country and the masses.
“However, it is very unfortunate that the government is adopting the policy of using parliament as a rubber stamp,” the statement said.
“The opposition believes that important internal and external issues are not being brought and debated in the parliament.
“By ignoring the parliament, the government is in fact boycotting the parliament which is the basic constitutional, legal and public forum in a democracy,” said the statement.
The opposition said the prime minister did not attend meetings on the most important national issues of the country such as occupied Jammu and Kashmir and others, “because he is ignorant of the democratic spirit of consultation, the importance of different views in decision-making and the usefulness of opposing views”.
In such circumstances, it said, such an “in-camera briefing” would merely pave the way for a new government “spectacle” that would have nothing to do with the performance of serious and critical issues facing the country and the people or progress towards their solution.
Furthermore, the joint opposition has agreed that the prime minister’s national security advisers were devoid of relevant information and authority on decision-making and behind-the-scene facts.
“These advisers are mere showpieces whose objectives have nothing to do with the real world and future blueprints,” said the joint statement.
Ms Aurangzeb said that the decision to boycott the PCNS meeting had been unanimous and the parties that would boycott the meeting were the PML-N, PPP, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, Jamaat-i-Islami, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, Awami National Party, Balochistan National Party-Mengal, Qaumi Watan Party and National Party. She said that independent MNA Mohsin Dawar had also decided not to attend the meeting.
Informed sources told Dawn that opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif had contacted the leaders of all opposition parties over the past two days for consultations and all the leaders were of the view that the PCNS meeting would be a futile exercise.
Speaking at a news conference in Islamabad, PML-N’s senior vice president and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi questioned the credibility of NSA Moeed Yousuf.
“A person who had nothing to do with Pakistan two years ago will give us briefing,” said Mr Abbasi while mocking the government’s move.
He said that by simply apprising the members as to what was happening in Afghanistan or the region was not sufficient, adding that issues of price hike and corruption were also related to the country’s national security.
He regretted that the government had closed the doors of parliament for discussion on public issues.
The joint opposition had attended the previous meeting of the PCNS held on November 8 in which military officials had briefed the lawmakers on national security issues.
The meeting, held at the main hall of the National Assembly, was attended by MNAs, senators, members of the federal cabinet, four chief ministers and the Azad Jammu and Kashmir prime minister.

5,500 cops being deployed on anti-riot duty

The protesters put barricades, big boulders and hurdles on the Coastal Highway to block the road from Ormara to Gwadar, suspending all kind of vehicular traffic on the highway. The protesters also closed Pasni Zero Point and Sarbandan cross by staging sit-ins, due to which Gwadar was cut off from Lasbela district and other areas.
Maulana Rehman visited various places where the people were staging sit-ins. He said that by blocking Coastal Highway at various places, the enthusiastic people of Gwadar and Lasbela districts had proved that they were fed up with the oppressive system and wanted to be free to go to sea and their lands and do business at the Pakistan-Iran border freely.
“People have been staging sit-ins for the last 18 days, but the government has not accepted our demands,” he said, adding that the demands were legitimate and they were nor very big demands, which the government could not accept.
He said that the sea was a source of livelihood given to the locals by God and for hundreds of years their forefathers had been fishing in the sea to feed their children, but now access to it was restricted.
“The people have become fed up with a large number of unnecessary security check-posts due to humiliation they faced during checking. They want removal of unnecessary check-posts.”
He said that protest and struggle were constitutional rights of the people and they were not afraid of policemen coming to Gwadar from different areas of Balochistan. “We will not give up the struggle for rights.”

3,"BHC hears plea against SSGC, Qesco","QUETTA: A division bench of the Balochistan High Cou­rt, comprising Chief Jus­tice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice...","QUETTA: A division bench of the Balochistan High Cou­rt, comprising Chief Jus­tice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Abdul Hameed Baloch, on Thursday heard a constitutional petition filed against the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) and the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) regarding bills and additional charges.
Petitioner Advocate Syed Nazeer Agha, SSGC’s lawyer Kamran Murtaza, Rukh­sana Kakar, the deputy attorney general, and others appeared before the court.
Advocate Murtaza, on be­­half of SSGC, stated that the constitutional petition filed by Advocate Agha and others is not admissible. Con­­­sumers should have appro­ached the Consumer Court, Ogra and other forums.
Mr Agha said that the constitutional petition was filed in public interest. He said PUG/slow meter charges were not being sent to consumers in Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and other cities. “PUG/Slow meters are being sent to the people of Balo­ch­istan only which is an injustice with them,” he added.
He showed the gas bills of consumers of Karachi and Islamabad and said these bills of up to Rs160 and Rs250 had been sent to consumers. These bills do not even include PUG / slow meter charges and PUG / GST columns whereas consumers in Quetta are being charged Rs40,000 PUG charges. He said it was a violation of Article 25 of the Constitution.
During the last hearing, Justice Baloch observed that proper supply of gas to Ziarat, Quetta, Pishin, Kalat and Mastung should be ensured and gas pressure should be maintained in Ziarat. He said meters should not be taken off in the absence of consumers. If the company has any complaint, then meters should be taken off in the presence of consumers.
An advertisement published in newspapers by SSGC was also presented and the court was informed that the step was taken for the convenience of the people.
Advocate Agha requested the court that the next hearing be fixed for Dec 9 instead of Dec 16 as winter vacations are about to begin in the court while SSGC lawyer Advocate Murtaza told the court that he was leaving the country. Therefore, the next hearing should be fixed for Dec 16.
The court adjourned the hearing to Dec 16.

7,PkMAP doesn’t want Balochistan’s bifurcation: Mehmood Achakzai,"Rejects perception that by using the word Pashtunkhwa, the party wants bifurcation of Balo­chistan.","QUETTA: Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai on Thursday said that Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai was the leader who laid the foundation of politics in the region while struggling against colonial rule and after creation of Pakistan he presented the concept of establishing the province of Pashtoonistan.
Speaking at a public meeting on the eve of 48th death anniversary of Khan Abdul Samad Khan Achakzai at the Railway Hockey ground, he rejected a perception that by using the word Pashtunkhwa they want bifurcation of real Balo­chistan. “We do not want division of real Balochistan.”
He said that Abdul Samad Khan Shaheed had added the word Pashtunkhwa to the name of his party after developing differences with the National Awami Party before the 1970 elections.
Mr Achakzai said Abdul Samad Khan’s entire struggle was for upholding human and Islamic values, respect for all nationalities and a society where the rights of everyone are protected on the basis of equality.
“We are making efforts to hold a congress in January for the party’s elections in which everyone will have a right to take part,” he said.

8,Supreme Court again raises questions over recruitment of paralegal staff,Asks SHC registrar to clear its doubts.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court asked the registrar of the Sindh High Court on Thursday to convince it that the SHC was the competent authority for the appointment of almost 1,200 paralegal staff over the past four years and that it did not extend any favours by relaxing the service rules.
A three-judge bench of the apex court, headed by Justice Umar Ata Bandial, asked Abdul Razzaq, the SHC registrar, to compile data (by Dec 10, the next date of hearing) explaining whether the test for senior positions in the district judiciary was carried out in a proper manner and under what criteria the age and domicile requirements were relaxed.
The apex court made the observations after taking up a petition by Ghulam Sarwar Qureshi which had sought a declaration that all appointments made in the Sindh judiciary since 2017, including those of civil judges and additional district judges, were ab initio mala fide, illegal, unconstitutional and had no legal effect.
Advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam represented the petitioner.

Asks SHC registrar to clear its doubts

The apex court was perturbed over the fact that the requirement of domicile was relaxed in favour of 14 stenographers, out of 19 appointed, in Karachi West district. The picture in Karachi East was no different as out of 16 stenographers appointed, the domicile requirement was relaxed to favour 11 candidates while the age requirement was relaxed for six others.
Moreover, no test was carried out to test the skills of stenographers selected for appointment, the Supreme Court regretted.
Abdul Razzaq, the registrar, told the bench that the domicile and age criteria were relaxed under Section 14 of the Sindh Judicial Service Rules.
Justice Bandial observed that the age requirement was relaxed usually when there was a pressing need to do so, but regretted that in the case under review the entire testing system seems to be flawed and that pick and choose was rife. In one instance, Justice Bandial added, a graduate was appointed to the post of “Farash”, a low cadre position.
At the last hearing on Nov 22, the apex court had noted a preliminary review revealed that for the post of clerks in the Sindh judiciary, the age limit was relaxed by five years and six months. As another example, Justice Bandial said six of the selected persons appeared to be related to Zulfikar Sheikh, who in turn is a close relative of the SHC chief justice.
The registrar conceded in his report that out of a total of 1,184 paralegal posts, 606 were filled through entry tests while 578 positions were filled without entry test. However, he added, most of them were in Grade 1-16.
The report, which was compiled after getting feedback and information from the district and sessions judges across the province, also conceded that only 978 jobs were advertised whereas 206 were not advertised.
Marks were assigned only for entry tests conducted through the National Testing Service (NTS) or the Sukkur Institute of Business Administration (IBA). The minimum passing marks varied from 33 per cent to 55pc in different districts.
In all 33,712 candidates were interviewed for 1,184 positions.
Candidates were required to pass an entry test before being eligible for interview. But no weightage system or marks were awarded in the interview.
A total of 48 candidates were given relaxation in the domicile condition while 248 applicants got age relaxation.
The report explained that district judges had been advised through a letter last month that the advertisements inviting applications for the post of stenographer should make it clear that if a candidate does not fulfil the domicile criterion, the SHC chief justice would be the final authority to decide whether to relax the condition or not.

9,IHC seeks AGP’s help in writ about apex court workforce,Petition says Pakistan Information Commission failed to comprehend the difference between law and Constitution,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Thursday sought the assistance of the attorney general for Pakistan in deciding the maintainability of a petition seeking disclosure of the entire workforce working in the Supreme Court.
The registrar of the Supreme of Court, Jawad Paul, through Additional Attorney General (AAG) Amir Rehman, filed the petition in the Islamabad High Court against the order of the Pakistan Information Commission (PIC).
The PIC had on July 12 this year allowed an application filed by a citizen, Mukhtar Ahmed, seeking information about the sanctioned strength of Supreme Court staff of BS-1-22, vacant posts, daily wage earners, posts created after January 1, 2017, persons with disabilities and transgenders working in the apex court.
The SC registrar filed a review against the PIC order, which was dismissed on November 17 this year.

Petition says Pakistan Information Commission failed to comprehend the difference between law and Constitution

Subsequently, the SC registrar through the petition, filed in the IHC, requested the high court declare the information commission’s directive as illegal.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah heard the petition.
AAG Rehman argued that the PIC could not issue such an order under the law.
He informed the court that the PIC, when approached, said that they had no powers to further review the decision under the law.
Justice Minallah asked AAG Rehman as to how the Supreme Court registrar was an aggrieved party in this case and whether the court could issue a writ against or for the SC registrar.
Further hearing of the case was adjourned for three weeks.
According to the petition, the PIC, under Section 17 of the Right of Access to Information Act, can give a decision about designated official of a public body.
The petition contended that the PIC erred in law while observing that the Supreme Court is a public body and failed to comprehend the difference between the federal law and the Constitution as the source
of law, adding that Articles 191 and 202 empowered the Supreme Court and high courts to frame rules regulating their practice and procedure.
The petition stated that “the direction issued by the PIC in exercise of power under section 20 (e) of the Act for the notification of designated officer under section 9 of the Act and to take measure for publication of information and record…applicable to public bodies and not to the constitutional court”.
It further stated that “only information which tends to erode the independence of judiciary is withheld, not to avoid scrutiny or to shut out transparency but in the larger interest of the public for ensuring the
independence of the judiciary which is necessary for effectively enforcing the fundamental right to ensure due process of law and access to justice”.
The petition requested the court to declare the PIC order as illegal.
Applicant Mukhtar Ahmed initially sought information from the Supreme Court. He approached the PIC upon refusal by the SC registrar to provide the same.
