The SAI took the decision at its meeting held here on Thursday presided over by Nawab Zubair Talpur, also attended by Mohammad Anwar, Jawaid Riar, Sharif Nizamani, Abdul Rahim Dars and others. 
The meeting hoped that farmers would get justice and noted that reports were being received that the PSMA had threatened with closure of sugar mills in Sindh.  
It warned the Sindh government and cane commissioner that the SAI would resist if the PSMA closed sugar mills. 
The meeting said the government should take notice that farmers were not getting cane purchase receipts (CPRs). It also demanded of the government to take notice of water shortage in Kotri barrage command area. Even drinking water shortage was being reported there, it added.  
The meeting demanded release of water for drinking for a few days every month. 
It expressed concern over the fact that despite water shortage, Punjab stole one million acre feet of water through flood canals, which was great injustice with the growers of Sindh.  
The meeting said the tail-end areas were not getting water despite its availability in canals and that situation was affecting wheat sowing. 
The meeting said black marketing and artificial shortage of fertilizer were being reported and its price had increased by 100pc causing serious problem to farmers.  
It observed that the government statistics showed sufficient availability of fertilizer, but its producing factories and dealers were busy in loot.  
The meeting called for supply of fertilizer directly to farmers. It also demanded a ban on the import of tomato from Iran and permission for the export of onion.

1,MQM-P lawmakers oppose govt decision to hand over medical college to SIUT,HYDERABAD: Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) parliamentarians have accused Sindh government of ...,"HYDERABAD: Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) parliamentarians have accused Sindh government of discriminating against urban population in its polices and expressed reservations over the Pakistan Peoples Party government’s decision to hand over under-construction medical college in Hyderabad to the Sindh Institute of Urology Transplantation (SIUT).
MNA Sabir Kaimkhani and MPA Rashid Khilji said at a press conference at the site of the college that the government was deliberately delaying completion of the college to deprive children of the city of medical education. 
They said the government was trying to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Sindh Institute of Urology Transplantation (SIUT) to hand it over the college’s building. 
They said that they would meet SIUT leadership including Dr Syed Adeebul Hassan Rizvi in this regard because integrity of Dr Rizvi and his colleagues was beyond reproach.
They hoped the SIUT leadership would also play a positive role considering the fact that the building was meant for medical college and SIUT was a postgraduate institute with no experience of undergraduate medical education. SIUT, Kaimkhani said, could at the most run a dialysis centre anywhere in Hyderabad for which this specific building was not meant for.
He said that PPP government was showing its bias towards urban population which was evident from its policy decisions. People of major urban centres had equal right over resources of Sindh and its budget and everyone knew the urban centres contributed generously to the country’s financial resources, he said.
He said the college building was approved in 2012-13 and it was now 97pc complete after a cost of Rs1.39bn. It was to be completed in three years it had not yet been finished, he said.
He slammed Sindh government for its anti-education policy that was pushing urban centres towards backwardness. This discrimination must stop, he said.
He said that MQM-P did not doubt intention of SIUT leadership but it did have serious reservations over PPP government’s intentions. The Sindh government did not allow establishment of kidney centre and child mother care hospital in the city and shifted the facilities from Latifabad to Qasimabad without any reason, they said.
He said that students of Hyderabad and adjoining districts sought admission to Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS), which was 18kms from the city. When Lyari Medical College was completed the government set aside 50pc seats only for the students of Lyari, he said and added the same principle should be applied to Hyderabad’s medical college. 
MPA Rashid Khilji said that he and two other MPAs had personally requested Sindh chief minister in the assembly that this college should be completed. He had promised to look into it but the recent decision of handing over the college building to SIUT was quite contrary to his assurance, he said.
He said that MQM’s petition on local government system was pending decision in apex court but it had not yet been taken up. Now again, he said, PPP government had passed controversial amendments to the local government law through recent legislation. 
He urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu notice of these issues and said the new law had deprived urban population of its rights. PPP’s decision was causing a sense of alienation among urban population and making them feel as if they were second rate citizens in Pakistan which was created by their forefathers, he said.

Hyderabad Commissioner Abbas Baloch had formed the body which was to be headed by Deputy Commissioner Fuad Ghaffar Soomro, according to a handout.  
It was decided on Thursday at a meeting presided over by the commissioner that the body would propose a policy for education, health and other matters related to unclaimed newborns found at different places or left in hospitals. The meeting noted that those infants were thrown by callous persons at garbage dumps, in streets and around hospitals, which was painful and insult to humanity.  
It observed that it was responsibility of government departments to stop violation of human rights as certain departments were meant for taking care of children.  
The commissioner said that in the presence of those departments, such insult of humanity could not be allowed. 
He directed the social welfare department, Child Protection Authority and special education department to take care of such newborns.

3,Khuhro dismisses objections over amended LG laws,‘MQM’s’ objection is open distrust in party members’ loyalty’...,"LARKANA: Pakistan Peoples Party Sindh president Nisar Ahmed Khuhro has dismissed Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s objections over amended local government laws, including election of mayor through secret ballot, as open distrust in its members’ loyalty. 
Khuhro said in a press statement issued here on Thursday that MQM-P only wanted to have open ballot in mayor’s election and wondered when election to the offices of prime minister, chief minister and Senate members were held secretly then why was such uproar being made on applying the procedure to mayor’s election, he said.
He advised MQM-P to have trust in itself and its members and said he was confident people would reject linguistic politics in upcoming local government election. 
Khuhro claimed the amendments to LG laws ensured trickling down of authority to grass root level with creation of towns. The Election Commission of Pakistan had mandate to use Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) in election as the option rested with it either to use or not the EVM, he said. 
It was the ECP’s responsibility to conduct election and not the government’s, he said, adding the federal government was threatening ECP with stoppage of funds if it declined to use the EVM. It was an attempt to enchain the commission, he added.

‘MQM’s’ objection is open distrust in party members’ loyalty’

He said that PTI government was deceiving overseas Pakistani voters with eye-catching slogans and termed the government move to woo them as part of pre-election rigging plan. 
As everybody knew, Sindh had serious reservations over census in the past and it was again looking skeptically at the new announcement about holding of census in 2022, fearing that it might end up in another U-turn of the present government, he said. 
He demanded inclusion of actual facts and figures about the population so that Sindh could receive its just and legitimate share in the National Financial Commission award.
He said that PPP would foil rulers’ evil designs who had in past maneuvered to show a decrease in Sindh’s population under a conspiracy to deprive Sindh of its genuine and constitutional right in NFC award. 
Khuro was critical of government’s intention of putting State Bank of Pakistan under the supervision of IMF and said the decision was tantamount to handing over the country’s financial matters to IMF. PPP would oppose tooth and nail the government’s move, he said.
He held PTI government’s polices responsible for increasing deficit in current account, raise in interest rates and devaluation of the country’s currency. Despite drop in rates of petrol in international market ie: $69 per barrel people in Pakistan were not reaping its benefit. Instead, he said, the government’s finance managers had enhanced petroleum levy by Rs4 per liter and increased GST from zero per cent to 1.63 per cent, he said. 
He said that when people were braving unprecedented price hike the finance maestros were out to suck peoples’ blood through such Draconian steps. 
He announced holding demonstrations in all district headquarters in the province on Dec 10 in protest against rise in petrol prices.

Advocate Mahar was shot dead by armed pillion riders while he was returning home in a car after dropping his child to a school in Gulistan-i-Jauhar.
Lawyers boycotted court proceedings across the province on Thursday on a call given by the SBC in protest against the murder.
Newly-elected secretary of the Sindh High Court Bar Association Umer Soomro along with a delegation of bar members called on judges to request them not to hold the day’s proceedings. Lawyers also took out a rally from City Courts to the Karachi Press Club demanding immediate arrest of the unknown killers.
Sharea Faisal police have registered a case against two unknown suspects on the complaint lodged by the victim’s brother, Rizwan Mahar, who had come to the city from his native place in Shikarpur to receive the body.
The FIR was registered under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) of 1997 and sections 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). 
According to the FIR, the assailants’ motive may be to spread fear and panic among lawyers as the victim was secretary of the bar council.
Sharea Faisal police investigator Chaudhry Arif quoted the complainant as telling the police that his family had no enmity with anyone.
Additional inspector-general of Karachi Imran Yaqoob Minhas has established a high-level probe team led by SSP East Qamar Raza Jiskani. The SSP investigation-I, SSP special investigation unit, SPO Gulshan and Sharea Faisal SHO and SIO are the other members of the team.
SSP Jiskani has said no clue to the killers has been found as yet.
The spent bullet casings collected from the crime scene had been sent to the forensic science lab and a report was awaited, he said.
No proceedings in lower courts
Legal proceedings in lower courts also remained suspended on Thursday due the boycott by lawyers.Hundreds  of cases fixed for hearing at the City Courts could not be taken up due  to non-production of undertrial prisoners from jails. Work at district  courts in Malir also remain suspended.
Protesting lawyers stayed away  from Malir courts held a demonstration at a section of the National  Highway and raised slogans for the arrest of the killers.

5,Sindh cabinet lowers pass percentage to 50pc in MDCAT,"""PMC’s defective admission policy bound to cause shortage of doctors in future,"" warns provincial health minister.","KARACHI: The Sindh cabinet citing “defective admission policy of the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC)” on Thursday decided to lower the required passing percentage for the MDCAT-2021 from 65pc to 50pc to qualify for admission to colleges and universities in the 2021-2022 session.
The decision would not only provide an opportunity to candidates from Sindh to seek admission to the medical and dental colleges/universities of the province, but would also facilitate the process of filling vacancies, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said while presiding over the cabinet meeting  at CM House here on Thursday.
The meeting was told that after replacing the Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PMDC), the National Assembly had passed the Pakistan Medical Commission (PMC) Act with the objective of regulating medical education and profession; and to recognise medical and dental qualifications in the country.
Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho told the meeting that Section 16(f) of the PMC Act-2020 authorises the commission to conduct all examinations whereas Section 18(3) provided that “The admission to medical or dental programs conducted by public colleges is to be regulated as per policy of provincial governments ... and “the marks obtained by a student in MDCAT conducted by the Authority shall constitute a minimum of 50 per cent of the weightage for the purposes of admission in the public colleges”.

‘PMC’s defective admission policy bound to cause shortage of doctors in future’

“Hence in PMC Act-2020, there is no mention of pass or fail percentage in the eligibility criteria for Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT). Likewise, there is no mention of a minimum compulsory passing score, which at present is 65 per cent,” she argued.
The health minister noted that the PMC conducted computer-based MDCAT-2021 exams in Oct 2021, based on federal curriculum on different dates. “The test from federal curriculum puts Sindh students at a disadvantage which resulted in low percentage of passing students,” she said, and added that last year, the passing percentage of MDCAT test was 60 per cent whereas this year, this requirement had been unilaterally increased to 65 per cent. “As a result, the total number of students who qualified last year was 8,287 (32.8pc) while those who qualified in MDCAT 2021 is 7,797 (22.4pc), and the total number of seats in medical and dental colleges (public and private) in Sindh is 5,490,” she pointed out.
The minister informed the meeting that last year, with the passing percentage of 60pc, 8,287 students in Sindh passed the exams and 2,900 of them got admissions in the public sector colleges. “Of the remaining 5,387 students, about 800 got admissions in the private sector colleges. The remaining 4,587 were not able to get admission, mainly due to affordability issue, leaving about 1,800 seats vacant,” she said.
Dr Pechuho said that the private sector acquired 1,300 candidates from other provinces while 492 seats remained unfilled. “With this growing trend of fewer admissions, Sindh will face a severe shortage of about 10,000 doctors in the next five years,” she said.
The chief minister said that WHO recommended one doctor for 850 people whereas Sindh had one doctor for 3,200 people. “Hence this gap of availability of doctors would further worsen the situation in future if it persists,” he said.
Keeping in view the situation, the cabinet decided to lower the passing percentage in MDCAT 2021 from 65pc to 50pc. The weightage of MDCAT-2021 in overall merit would remain the same as prescribed under the PMCAct, according to the decision.
Buses procurement
Transport  Minister Awais Qadir Shah told the cabinet that his department had  signed an agreement with the National Radio & Telecommunication  Corporation (NRTC) for the procurement of 250 diesel hybrid buses in October.
It pertained to the Sindh  Intra-district Peoples Bus Service Project for Karachi,  Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana, Mirpurkhas and Shaheed Benazirabad and the procurement would be done through the  Sindh Mass Transit Authority.
He said that the construction of  a depot, operation and maintenance of the vehicles and revenue collection would  be undertaken by private operators.
The chief minister directed  the minister to make the buses operational latest by April 2022. The cabinet  approved the agreement signed by the transport department with NRTC.
Thalassemia Foundation
The  provincial cabinet on the recommendation of health department approved  creation of ‘Sind Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Foundation (STHF)’ to  work for the promotion, development and financing of Thalassemia and  hemoglobinopathy centres across the province for prevention and  treatment of the disease.
The foundation will have an 11-member body under the secretary health to govern the foundation.
Amendments
The  provincial cabinet on the recommendation of the population department  discussed and approved amendments to The Sindh Reproductive Healthcare  Rights Act, 2019. Under the amendment, premarital consultation on family  planning has been made mandatory for registration of Nikah. 
Telehealth & self-care and maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response have also been made part of the bill.
Through  an amendment to the Dow University of Health Sciences Act-2004, the Sindh  Medical College section was abolished from the Act as the SMC has been  established as a fully-fledged university and similar other amendments  were approved and referred to the provincial assembly. 
Khairpur Special Economic Zone 
The  provincial investment department told the meeting that the chief  minister had already approved creation of Sindh Economic Zones  Management Company (SEZMC) as an administrative agency of the Khairpur  Special Economic Zone, established on an area of 140 acres as the first  Industrial Park with the SEZ status.
On the request of the investment  department the cabinet authorised the SEZMC to take over as  administrative agency of KSEZ and immediately accommodate investors/zone enterprises.
The cabinet also abolished the  steering committee working under the Sukkur commissioner for allotment of plots and infrastructure development.
On the request of CM’s  Adviser on Agriculture Manzoor Wassan, the chief minister directed SEZMC  to complete all the ongoing schemes of the zone on a priority basis.

‘Robbers’ kill two men in separate incidents
Two men were shot dead by suspected robbers apparently over putting up resistance in separate incidents in the city, police said on Thursday.
A 45-year-old man, Mohammed Maqbool, was shot and killed during a robbery near Rangers post in a SITE locality.
Area SHO Zafar Ali Shah said that Maqool was returning from a bank on a motorbike when unidentified suspects shot him near the Rangers post. He suffered critical bullet wounds and was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where he died during treatment.

7,SHC stays takeover of Mohatta Palace by official assignee,Directive issued to change name of the heritage building to Qasr-e-Fatima in all documents.,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Thursday directed the official assignee not to take over the possession of Qasr-e-Fatima, commonly known as Mohatta Palace, till the final decision on an around 50-year-old suit about the heritage property.  
While disposing of a set of intra-court appeals filed against orders of a single-judge bench, the division bench of SHC headed by Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi also said that since the matter was very old, the final judgement/decree on the suit pending before the single-judge bench may be passed at an early date and preferably within four weeks after hearing concluding arguments from the lawyers of parties.  
It further stated that the single bench in an order had directed the provincial government and defendants to change the name of the subject property from Mohatta Palace to Qasr-e-Fatima in all documents and the same would remain suspended till a final decision on the suit in question.  
“However, the learned single judge may be at liberty to pass appropriate order to this effect, either by consent of parties or otherwise, at the time of deciding of the final fate of the subject suit,” the two-judge bench in its order added. 

Directive issued to change name of the heritage building to Qasr-e-Fatima in all documents

It further said that all lawyers for parties must appear before the single bench on the next date, which according to the lawyers has been fixed on Dec 8. 
“The suit may be taken up for arguments on Dec 15 when the counsel for parties may be at liberty to make their submissions on all factual and legal aspects involved in the matter and the single bench may pass appropriate orders and shall finally decide the suit through judgment or decree in accordance with law,” it concluded.  
Last month, the division bench through an interim order had restrained the official assignee from taking over the possession of property after the provincial government and the Mohatta Palace Gallery Trust, which is currently maintaining a museum there, filed intra-court appeals against earlier orders of the single-judge bench. Later, neighbouring residents of Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah’s heritage property located in Clifton also approached the bench against the single bench’s order.  
On Oct 13, the single bench had directed the official assignee to take over possession of the building for setting up a medical college and the same to be run under an independent body with the consent of the parties.  
In another order the bench had also stated that only Qasr-e-Fatima be used as the name of the heritage property in all documents.  
However, the provincial government in its appeal contended that an assistant advocate general had given consent to the impugned order of Oct 13 without any authority as he did not have any instruction to record his consent and the same was not binding on the appellants.  
The order was passed on a suit filed by a relative of Fatima Jinnah about the administration of her moveable and immovable properties including Qasr-e-Fatima in 1971 against the Shireen Jinnah Charitable Trust and others.

9,Experts call for plans to ensure patient safety in healthcare settings,"KARACHI: Highlighting importance of patients’ safety in healthcare settings in recent times, speakers at a...","KARACHI: Highlighting importance of patients’ safety in healthcare settings in recent times, speakers at a conference emphasised the need for plans and strategies to promote safety culture among healthcare providers and reduce burden of patient harm at medical facilities.
They were speaking at the First National Patient Safety Conference – Patient Centered Care -- organised by Sindh government in collaboration with the Indus Hospital & Health Network (IHHN) and World Health Organisation (WHO) at a local hotel.
The event attracted over 100 representatives from various public and private healthcare organisations.
According to speakers, patient safety has become an essential healthcare discipline in recent times due to the complexity of healthcare systems and the rising trend of patient harm at medical facilities. The noted that global efforts to reduce the burden of patient harm had not achieved substantial change over the past 15 years, despite pioneering work in some healthcare settings.
“Patient safety is a critical global issue, and it is vital how we deal with it. Every year many patients are harmed because of unsafe practices. We are working on plans to take action in addressing the issues of patient safety,” noted Dr Palitha Mahipala, Head of Mission-Pakistan, WHO, while addressing the conference virtually.
She informed the audience that the WHO-Pakistan was collaborating with the federal ministry of health on initiatives and national strategies that would help improve quality of care and expand patient safety to primary care and engage communities.
Dr Lubna Mushtaq representing the IHHN said the conference was the need of the hour and that times were changing due to Covid-19 and the Omicron variant.
“It is estimated that the cost of harm associated with the loss of life or permanent disability, which results in lost capacity and productivity of the affected patients and families, amounts to trillions of US dollars every year.”
Additionally, she pointed out, the psychological cost to the patients and their families (associated with the loss or disabling of a loved one), was undoubtedly significant, though more difficult to measure.
“Patient harm due to adverse events is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The available evidence suggests that hospitalisation in the low- and middle-income countries leads to 134 million adverse events annually, resulting in 2.6 million deaths,” she said.
Balochistan Health Minister Syed Ehsan Shah, also the guest of honour, said the event had provided an opportunity to talk about the critical aspect of healthcare on a larger level and take urgent action to ensure that patients were looked after during their hospital stay.
“Paramedics have the most critical role in healthcare and require proper training to ensure that qualified professionals are at the helm. Third-world countries suffer the most from poor patient care, which has resulted in over 2.5 million deaths. If we look at this closely, it is a statistical tragedy.”
Sindh Parliamentary Health Secretary Qasim Siraj Soomro spoke on the challenged faced by provincial government with respect to quality patient care, and said there was an enormous burden on the health sector despite the many initiatives taken to address them.
“Our specialised areas are neglected, and the root cause for diseases like HIV and others still have more questions than answers,” he remarked.
The conference held three sessions on ‘Access to care and health literacy, ‘Patient safety culture -- leadership commitment’ and ‘Patient advocacy’. The participants discussed the challenges of disease burden and health equity in the healthcare system of Pakistan and the role of regulatory authorities in patient-centered care.

10,Suicides in Karachi,"KARACHI: On Nov 29, a young man jumped off the third floor of a shopping mall in the Gulshan-i-Iqbal area and killed...","KARACHI: On Nov 29, a young man jumped off the third floor of a shopping mall in the Gulshan-i-Iqbal area and killed himself. A few days prior to that, a former employee of a TV channel, father of six, committed suicide in the same vicinity. The reason that the mainstream and social media gave for both deaths was the men’s poor financial status. They either owed money to people or could not put food on the table for their children.
This is a harrowing scenario. While suicide is a global phenomenon mainly triggered by either depression or the feeling of meaninglessness in life, and can be prevented, the recent occurrences in Karachi require a great deal of introspection and investigation.
The population of the Sindh capital, over the last two decades especially, has increased by leaps and bounds. Not that it’s a new phenomenon; ever since independence, Karachi has been witnessing demographic growth like no other city of Pakistan simply because of the economic opportunities that it offers to citizens of the country. To boot, when Pakistan came into being, it was a beautiful littoral town with breathtaking architecture and a charming atmosphere. Back then, the number of its inhabitants was between 300,000 and 400,000.
Seventy-four years later, the very fact that the city has always been known and appreciated for – that it provides ample opportunities to people to earn a decent living – is fast becoming a distant reality, almost a dream. The phrase “that no one sleeps in Karachi with an empty stomach” appears to be losing truthfulness.
To analyse why a pall of gloom has settled over the city, firstly, a look at its demographic situation, again, might give us a clue. The population of Karachi, some believe, is touching the 30 million mark – though official figures suggest much less. The container (where people can be placed) is filled to the brim. It puts tremendous pressure on those whose duty it is to make sure that the city gets an uninterrupted supply of amenities. In the last two decades, people from all parts of the country have arrived here, for reasons that range from a turbulent law and order situation in their cities of birth or to get employment. Fair enough. The metropolis belongs to all us.
(Political maneuvering is also cited as a cause, but let’s not go there, for it’s a sensitive topic.)
The other reason is the pandemic that has put the clamps on the entire world. Industries, such as the aviation business, have suffered like never before, incurring huge losses and prompting wide-scale layoffs. Karachi, like any other part of the world, has also had to bear the brunt of it.
It is in times like these that the power, sagacity and compassion of governments are needed the most. They need to take measures that emanate from a point of empathy than anything else. Prejudices and political compulsions blind us from the goodness that we carry within ourselves.
Karachiites have always played a significant role in the country’s financial progress and its cultural robustness. And now they have begun to feel the pinch.

11,Issues of KMC-run healthcare facilities be resolved: PMA,"KARACHI: Questioning the legality of the recently-passed local government bill, representatives of the Pakistan...","KARACHI: Questioning the legality of the recently-passed local government bill, representatives of the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) on Thursday called upon the Sindh health minister to take personal interest in the affairs of these institutions and address their longstanding issues pertaining to the funding, healthcare workers, medical education, hospital facilities and patient care. 
The association at a presser held at the PMA House suggested that the Karachi Medical and Dental College (KMDC) should be made autonomous and Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH) should be brought under the administrative control of the college. 
The briefing was held in the backdrop of the recently-passed Local Government (Amendment) Bill, 2021, which gives total control to the provincial government over municipal organisations. 
Among other things, the new bill also takes back health-related functions as well as operations of several healthcare facilities including the KMDC and ASH. 
“We are extremely concerned about the recent changes in the provincial healthcare system. The new legislation will have a long-term impact on patients, doctors as well as medical students attached with these institutions,” said Dr Abdul Ghafoor Shoro representing the PMA-Karachi. 
He also questioned whether the contents of the bill and Sindh Assembly’s approval were according to the spirit of the Constitution. “This bill has already been challenged in the court as the 18th Amendment empowers the local bodies. Nevertheless, there is no conflict over the urgency required to look into the sorry state of KMC-run institutions,” Dr Shoro said, suggesting that it would have been appropriate if the government had supported the KMC in bringing improvement at these institutions. 
The experts recommended that the government should make the KMDC autonomous with a government body having powers to take decisions related to finance as well as hiring and firing. All appointments, they said, should be on merit with immediate effect. 
“The KMDC students desperately need a competent faculty and structured medical education system. The School of Nursing at the ASH needs immediate intervention and support for smooth running and improvement in the training of human resources. 
“Sobhraj Hospital and attached maternity homes in the city of Karachi should be given autonomous status and run with public-private partnership,” said Dr Mirza Ali Azhar, while pointing out the issues plaguing these healthcare facilities for a long time. 
The Karachi Heart Hospital and Leprosy Centre, he said, were suffering due to chronic funding issues and lack of active support of the government. 
“These institutions are providing services to a large poor population. We hope that the health minister will take immediate action for the effective running of these centres,” he said.

13,Construction ordinance aimed at legalising land-grab: Haleem Adil Sheikh,Terms Sindh Local Government Amendment Bill a clear violation of the Constitution.,"KARACHI: Rejecting the Sindh Commission for Regularisation of Construction Ordinance, Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh on Thursday described the ordinance as an attempt to legalise land grabbing and forgeries by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government.  
Addressing a press conference at the Sindh Assembly building, he said that around 3.9 million acres of state land was under illegal occupation in the province and the PPP government was aiming to legalise all encroachments and counterfeit documentation on so-called “humanitarian grounds” amid the situation arising out of the judiciary’s order for the demolition of Nasla Tower and removal of encroachments along the Gujjar Nullah.  
“If the ordinance is aimed at compensating the affected families of Nasla Tower, Gujjar Nullah or Orangi Nullah and people living in katchi abadis, then it must be specified in the draft ordinance,” he said.  
Accusing the Sindh government of having ill-intentions, he said that “it is obvious from the terms of composition of the proposed commission that it would be headed by a retired judge and it might include Murtaza Wahab and a representative of the Association of Builders and Developers (Abad)”. He said stakeholders and parliamentary parties should be taken into confidence on the legislation as per democratic norms. 
He also suggested that the proposed commission should be notified by the chief justice of Pakistan after detailed consultation with opposition. The commission, he said, must be chaired by a sitting judge of the Supreme Court as case of illegal construction and land grabbing in Sindh was being heard by Supreme Court, he argued.  
“If reservations of opposition are not removed, we will challenge the ordinance in the court as this draft ordinance will bring Sindh Assembly, political system, executive and governor of Sindh in confrontation with judiciary,” added Mr Sheikh.  
He also took exception to Sindh Local Government Amendment Bill 2021, calling it a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan and the spirit of devolution of powers to grassroots level and announced that he would challenge the bill in higher courts as well.  
The Articles 7, 8, 32 and 140-A of the Constitution, he said, called for empowerment of local government institutions and transferring education, health, civic services and other basic functions and responsibilities to third tier of governance.  
“On the contrary, the local government bodies are deprived of all their basic functions and responsibilities and they are left only to manage public toilets,” he added.  
“The amendment bill would bring primary healthcare, including Sobhraj Hospital and Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Leprosy Centre, Sarfraz Rafiqui Shagheed Centre, Karachi Medical and Dental College, Infectious Disease Department and many educational institutions under control of the Sindh government.”

15,MQM-P warns of Sindh-wide protest against PPP policy,"“PPP is convinced since it can’t rule Karachi or any other city, it should deprive them of their basic rights,” says party leader.","KARACHI The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Thursday warned of strong province-wide protest against the ‘atrocities’ being committed against the people of Karachi and said that the MQM-P had left with no option but to take to streets against the Pakistan Peoples Party government and its policies which were ‘anti-Karachiites’ and ‘anti-development’ of the province’s urban centres.  
At a protest demonstration held in line with the recently-launched campaign against the Sindh Local Government Amendment Bill 2021 near Gujjar Nullah where anti-encroachment operation had demolished several homes, leaders of the MQM-P called for countrywide awareness movement to build momentum for the rights of Karachi and warned that the existing policies of the provincial government for the country’s business capital would cause suffering to the masses and could lead to a national disaster.  
“The PPP has never enjoyed government in urban areas of Sindh and what it’s doing in revenge is creating anti-city policies and isolating the Karachiites,” said the party’s parliamentary leader in the Sindh Assembly Kanwar Naveed Jamil said while addressing the protesters. A large number of people including women and children participated in the protest. Carrying placards and chanting slogans against the Sindh government, they demanded the authorities to restore Karachi rights and power to local bodies’ system.  
“The PPP is convinced that since it can’t rule Karachi, Hyderabad or any other city in Sindh, it should deprive them of their basic rights. The leaders of this [PPP] who call themselves champions of democracy are in fact true feudal and treat the people of the province as their bonded labourers. From court to parliament, we have knocked on every door to tell them that our houses are being demolished, our health system is collapsing and our youngsters are being deprived of jobs, but no one listens to us. We have left with no option but to protest.”  
He alleged that the jobs reserved for the people of urban Sindh were being doled out to the residents of rural areas on the basis of fake domiciles and permanent residence certificates (PRCs). The state of corruption in the Sindh government, he said, was such that 500 officers involved in the National Accountability cases were in offices reflecting the true face of PPP’s approach of governance and its direct involvement in such practices. 
“Under the same corrupt policy, they have decided to elect the mayor through secret balloting,” said Mr Jamil. “They know they can’t win elections or hearts but they can keep people silent or buy them through millions and billions, they have made through corruption. The PPP has attempted to create a replica of the same corrupt system at level of local bodies which it has been operating at provincial level for last 13 years.”
