0,Alex Carey wins race to be Australian wicket-keeper for Ashes,"“He is an excellent cricketer and a fine individual who will bring many great strengths,"" says chief selector George Bailey.","BRISBANE: Alex Carey called it  “a boyhood dream” as he won the race on Thursday to be Australia’s wicket-keeper for the first two Ashes Tests against England after scandal-hit Tim Paine stepped down.
The 30-year-old Carey has played plenty of limited-overs cricket for Australia and stood in as the ODI captain in the West Indies this year, but is yet to feature in a Test match.
That will change in Brisbane next week, barring any late mishaps, after he was added to the 15-man squad.
“Alex has been a regular member of the national side in white-ball cricket, particularly in the one-day game,” said chief selector George Bailey.
“He is an excellent cricketer and a fine individual who will bring many great strengths into the team.”
Carey and fellow gloveman Josh Inglis were in a showdown for the role, but the writing was on the wall after Inglis returned home to Perth this week when Australia’s planned intra-squad match in Brisbane fell victim to rain.
Carey has long been considered the understudy to Paine, but Inglis’ superb domestic form in recent seasons saw him vault into contention.
“I am incredibly humbled by this opportunity. It’s an exciting build-up for what is a huge series ahead,” said Carey, adding that he had  “a smile from ear to ear”.
“We all know there is a lot going on at the moment and my first thoughts are with Tim [Paine] and his family. Hopefully we see him back here soon. The full squad is with him and his family.”
Carey got the nod after Paine quit as Test captain and then last week stepped away from cricket over a text-message scandal, leaving selectors scrambling for an alternative just ahead of the Dec 8 first Test.
While Carey was overlooked for Australia’s T20 squad that won the World Cup last month, with Inglis preferred, it ultimately worked in his favour with plenty of domestic red-ball cricket under his belt in recent weeks.
“I feel like my lead-in has been pretty good and super-excited to get the call,” he said.
“To hopefully have full stands, an Ashes series on home soil, it’s really boyhood dreams coming true and excited to prepare as best I can.”
Australia’s starting eleven is now largely locked in, although selectors need to decide between Usman Khawaja and Travis Head at number five after incumbent Matthew Wade was axed from the squad.
There has also been some chatter that paceman Jhye Richardson might be preferred to Mitchell Starc.
Squad: Pat Cummins (captain), Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Marcus Harris, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Mitchell Swepson, David Warner.

1,Loss of China events over Peng could go past 2022: WTA,"“Our approach to this and our request to the authorities are consistent and they’ll stay there,"" says WTA CEO Steve Simon.","LAUSANNE: The suspension of all WTA tournaments in China because of concerns about the safety of Peng Shuai, a Grand Slam doubles champion who accused a former government official there of sexual assault, could result in cancellations of those events beyond 2022, the head of the women’s professional tennis tour said on Wednesday. 
“We’re hopeful we get to the right place, but we are prepared, if it continues as it is which hasn’t been productive to date that we will not be operating in the region,” WTA President and CEO Steve Simon told The Associated Press in a video call from California. “This is an organisational effort that is really addressing something that’s about what’s right and wrong.”
He said the move to put a halt to the tours play in China, including Hong Kong, came with the backing of the WTA Board of Directors, players, tournaments and sponsors. It is the strongest public stand against China taken by a sports body and one that could cost the WTA millions of dollars. 
Peng dropped out of public view after raising the allegations about former vice premier Zhang Gaoli in a Nov 2 social media posting that was quickly taken down by Chinese authorities. 
In the month since, Simon has made repeated calls for China to carry out an inquiry into the 35-year-old Peng’s accusations and to allow the WTA to communicate directly with the former top-ranked doubles player and owner of titles at Wimbledon and the French Open. 
“Our approach to this and our request to the authorities are consistent and they’ll stay there. We definitely would like to have our own discussion with Peng and be comfortable that she’s truly safe and free and has not been censored, intimidated or anything like that,” Simon said. “We still haven’t been able to have that conversation to have the comfort that what we’re seeing isn’t being orchestrated, to date. The second element of that is that we want a full and transparent without any level of censorship investigation on the allegations that were made.”
China typically hosts about 10 womens tennis tournaments each year, including the prestigious season-ending WTA Finals, which are scheduled to be held there for a decade. The nation is a source of billions of dollars in income for various sports entities based elsewhere, including the WTA (headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida), the NBA (run out of New York) and the International Olympic Commi­ttee (Lausanne, Switzerland). 
Simon said the suspension, announced Wednesday via a statement from him issued by the tour, means that tournaments could still end up being staged in China if its government follows through with his requests. If not, the events could be moved to other countries, as happened this year, when the tours Asian swing was called off because of COVID-19 concerns; the WTA Finals, for example, were shifted to Guadalajara, Mexico, last month. 
The WTA drew criticism on Thursday from China for its decision which comes as Beijing prepares to host the Winter Olympics in February. Global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Beijing Olympics over China’s human rights record. 
Many leading figures in the tennis world applauded the WTA’s decision to walk away from one of its biggest markets. 
Asked about the matter at a regular briefing in Beijing on Thursday, foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin did not directly comment on the WTA’s move, but said China “opposes the politicisation of sports”. 
While Beijing has remained largely silent over the Peng scandal, The Chinese Tennis Association expressed “indignation and firm opposition” to the WTA’s announcement while the Global Times newspaper published by the ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily took aim at the WTA. 
In an editorial on its Twitter account on Thursday, which is not accessible within China, the paper accused the WTA of “bringing politics into women’s tennis”, categorising it among “betrayers of the Olympic spirit”. 
The English-language tabloid added, “Some forces in the West are instigating a boycott against the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.” 
The International Olympic Committee said it held a second video call with Peng on Wednesday, following one late last month. 
The IOC, whose president Thomas Bach spoke to Peng for 30 minutes on November 21 in one of the first contacts that a Western organisation had with her. 
“We have offered her wide-ranging support, will stay in regular touch with her, and have already agreed on a personal meeting in January,” it said in a statement on Thursday. 
Peng appeared to be “safe and well, given the difficult situation she is in,” it added. 
Bach faced criticism after the first call for failing to make demands about Peng’s safety and the IOC defended its approach in a statement on Thursday. 
“We are using ‘quiet diplomacy’ which, given the circumstances and based on the experience of governments and other organisations, is indicated to be the most promising way to proceed effectively in such humanitarian matters,” the IOC said. 
Tennis, stars including men’s number one Novak Djokovic and women’s tour founder Billie Jean King, threw their support behind the WTA’s move. 
Djokovic called the WTA’s stance “very bold and very courageous”, while 12-time Grand Slam singles winner King tweeted that the WTA was “on the right side of history.” 
Tennis great Martina Navratilova challenged the IOC to respond, writing on Twitter that “so far I can barely hear you!!!”

After coming from behind to beat Sevilla 2-1 on Sunday, Real had a game in hand to play against Athletic and they took advantage of the opportunity to take control at the summit. 
Benzema put in another superb performance, scoring Real’s winner five minutes before the break. 
Bilbao keeper Unai Simon saved a Marco Asensio shot from outside the area, Luka Modric mis-hit the rebound and it landed at the feet of Benzema, who finished into the empty net. 
The France striker celebrated with the Real fans, who chanted “Benzema is Ballon d’Or” after he missed out on the award for the best player in the world earlier in the week. 
“Benzema deserved to win the Ballon d’Or,” keeper Thibaut Courtois told reporters. “It was weird. Looks like the voters only look at what happens in Copa America and the Euros, don’t look at the season as a whole.” 
Real opened a seven-point lead over both Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad. They have 36 points from 15 matches. Atletico have a game in hand compared to their city rivals. 
COPA DEL REY First-division clubs Sociedad, Mallorca, Espanyol, Sevilla and Real Betis all won their Copa del Rey matches against lower-division clubs to advance to the next round. 
Sevilla struggled the most, needing a goal by Lucas Ocampos in the second half of extra time to defeat fourth-division club Cordoba 1-0 in a match between southern Spanish clubs.

The Lahore-born Qasim will also captain the team in the U-19 Asia Cup that will be held in the UAE later this month. The junior selection committee of the Pakistan Cricket Board had invited 21 high-performing cricketers, born on or after Sept 1, 2002 (eligibility criteria), for a trai­ning camp that is currently underway in Lahore to prepare the side for the two events. The camp began last week.

4,Liverpool entertain as top trio break clear in title race,"LONDON: Only two points separate Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. There’s...","LONDON: Only two points separate Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool at the top of the Premier League. There’s no dou­bting who the entertainers are with the most high-powered attack. 
Liverpool hit four goals for a third consecutive game by beating Everton 4-1 in the Merseyside derby on Wednesday, taking the team’s scoring tally to 43 in 14 games the most in a major European league so far. 
Juergen Klopp’s 2020 champions remained in third, but with another 24 games to go that’s far from a concern. 
“The performance of all of the boys was absolutely outstanding,” Klopp said. 
On a rare occasion when the front-runners were playing at the same time, Manchester City won 2-1 at Aston Villa to stay a point ahead of Liverpool in second and Chelsea remain a point better off at the top after beating Watford by the same score. 
“We’ve had an incredibly tough first part of the league,” City manager Pep Guardiola said. “We are there one point behind. The important thing is the way we are performing. The way we are performing is a high level.” 
The top three are now seven points clear of fourth place after West Ham United held to a 1-1 draw at Brighton & Hove Albion. Leicester City and Southampton also drew 2-2, while the meeting between sixth-placed Wolver­hampton Wanderers and Burnley was goalless.
Klopp’s side got four goals at the home of their neighbours for the first time since 1982, with Mohamed Salah scoring twice to maintain his electric form. 
Jordan Henderson put Liverpool in front with a magnificent curling shot in the ninth minute before setting up Salah for the second. 
It was one-way traffic and Everton, led by former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez, looked at real risk of an embarrassing scoreline. 
Demarai Gray pulled back a goal before the interval to give a restless home crowd some hope before a mistake by Seamus Coleman allowed Salah in on goal to make it 3-1 and then Diogo Jota produced a brilliant turn before blasting past Jordan Pickford to complete the rout. 
Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard could not do his old club a favour as his 100 percent start as Villa manager was ended by City. 
Bernardo Silva’s volley from Gabriel Jesus’ cross followed Ruben Dias’ goal for City in the first half at Villa Park. Ollie Watkins reduced the deficit in the 47th with a first-time finish off a corner to the near post but City held on. 
After recent draws against Burnley and Manchester United, Chelsea could ill afford to drop points at Watford but manager Thomas Tuchel conceded they were fortunate to collect all three from Vicarage Road. 
After a half an hour hold up early in the match as a fan was attended to by emergency services, the visitors took the lead when Mason Mount coolly converted after a well-worked move in the 29th minute. 
Watford deservedly levelled before the break through Nigerian Emmanuel Dennis only for substitute Hakim Ziyech to strike the winner 12 minutes later with the outstanding Mount the creator. 
“We need a lot of points if we want to stay in the title race. We felt like we lost two points against Burnley and Manchester United. We stole minimum two, maybe three back today,” said Tuchel. 
“Overall we can do much better. There are some reasons — we have injured players and some key players due to overload were not on the pitch. I dont want to be too critical. Watford deserved more,” he added. 
An 89th-minute overhead kick from Neal Maupay frustrated West Ham at Brighton after the Londoners had taken an early lead through Czech midfielder Tomas Soucek’s header. 
Leicester had to come from behind twice to get a draw at Southampton with James Maddison’s 49th-minute strike earning Brendan Rodgers’s side a point that leaves the Foxes in eighth place. Southampton are two points above the relegation zone, which features Burnley, Norwich City and last-placed Newcastle United.

5,Inspired Djokovic doubles up as Serbia reach semis,MADRID: Imperious Novak Djokovic sent Serbia into a Davis Cup semi-final against Croatia as the world number one...,"MADRID: Imperious Novak Djokovic sent Serbia into a Davis Cup semi-final against Croatia as the world number one inspired a comeback victory over Kazakhstan on Wednesday. 
Serbia had their backs to the wall when Kazakh veteran Mikhail Kukushkin beat debutant Miomir Kecmanovic 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 7-6 (13-11) in a three-hour epic in the first singles rubber. 
But Djokovic calmly levelled the tie and preserved his 10-year undefeated Davis Cup singles record when he eased past 36th-ranked Alexander Bublik 6-3, 6-4 in 77 minutes before returning to court to team up with Nikola Cacic and beat Kazakh pair Andrey Golubev and Aleksandr Nedovyesov 6-2, 2-6, 6-3. 
“We were unlucky in the first match, we came so close. But Novak was incredible in singles and doubles,” said Serbia captain Viktor Troicki who had played alongside Djokovic in the team’s last appearance in the finals in 2019. Djokovic has played five out of a possible six rubbers at the Davis Cup Finals so far and looks in the mood to take the team to the title they won memorably in Belgrade in 2010. 
When Cacic, who had struggled during the second set, drilled a low return to enable Serbia to clinch victory on their third match point, Djokovic and his team-mates celebrated loudly. 
Kazakhstan, who were cheered throughout by a noisy band of followers in the Madrid Arena, have now lost all six Davis Cup quarter-finals they have contested. 
“I’m proud of the fighting spirit; we dropped off in the second set but we bounced back and held our nerves, I’m proud of Nikola and proud of this team,” Djokovic said on court. 
Serbia reached the last four for the first time since 2017 and will face Croatia, who got past Italy on Monday. 
Germany will face either Sweden or Russia in the other semi-final with the final also being played in Madrid on Sunday.

Milan were looking for improvement after back-to-back league losses to Fiorentina and Sassuolo, and they took control early on at the Stadio Luigi Ferraris when Zlatan Ibrahimovic fired home a 10th-minute free kick.
Brazilian winger Messias, who scored the winner against Atletico Madrid on his Champions League debut last week, was named in Stefano Piolis starting line-up for the first time and marked the occasion by scoring either side of the break. 
He opened his league account with the Rossoneri in first-half stoppage time with a looping header and scored his third goal in a week in the 61st with an angled drive into the bottom left corner. 
“Today I did the best I could. These guys make me enjoy myself and make me feel young,” Ibrahimovic told Sky Italia. “Unfortunately we lost the last two games but the season is still long. There are ups and downs over the year.” 
In Reggio Emilia, Sassuolo fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Napoli, leaving the Partenopei on 36 points, one ahead of second-placed Milan. 
Napoli looked set to strengthen their grip on first place when Fabian Ruiz and Dries Mertens struck in the second half to give Luciano Spalletti’s side a comfortable lead at the Mapei Staidum. 
But the hosts, fresh from beating Milan 3-1 at the weekend, launched a stirring comeback through a Gianluca Scamacca volley and 89th-minute Gian Marco Ferrari header. 
Sassuolo thought they had won it deep in stoppage time when Gregoire Defrel fired into the bottom corner, but Napoli were saved by a VAR review that disallowed the goal for a foul. 
Lautaro Martinez scored one goal and set up another as Inter Milan beat Spezia 2-0 to move to 34 points, two behind Napoli. 
Roberto Gagliardini finished off a well-worked team move to put the Nerazzurri ahead at halftime, and Martinez’s penalty after the break secured a third consecutive league win for the first time under coach Simone Inzaghi. 
Elsewhere, Bologna stunned AS Roma with a 1-0 win as Mattias Svanberg’s stunning first-half strike inflicted a sixth league defeat of the season on Jose Mourinhos side. 
The 22-year-old midfielder curled a fabulous shot into the bottom corner after 35 minutes to send his side eighth on 24 points, one behind fifth-placed Roma.

Argentine forward Messi, who skipped training on Tuesday with a bout of gastro-enteritis a day after claiming a record-extending seventh Ballon d’Or, was on par with an uninspired PSG who stayed top of the standings with 41 points from 16 games.
Olympique de Marseille leapfrogged Stade Rennais into second place with a 1-0 win at Nantes as the Rennes side slumped to a 2-1 home defeat against champions Lille.
Marseille, who have a game in hand, have 29 points, with Rennes on 28 and Nice in fourth place on 27. 
RC Lens, who have not won any of their last three games, are fifth on 26 points after drawing 2-2 at promoted Clermont. 
In Paris, Messi displayed his Ballon d’Or trophy and Gianluigi Donnarumma showed his Yashin trophy for the Best Goalkeeper of the Year before kickoff but PSG’s performance was far from glittering. 
They enjoyed possession but Nice were looking to hit them on the break and they had a huge opportunity just before the hour when Kasper Dolberg’s header crashed on to Donnarumma’s post. 
It was the highlight of a dismal, wet evening in Paris where Mauricio Pochet­tino’s side continued to struggle. 
Marseille are now 12 points behind with a game in hand after being in control throughout at Nantes.
Gerson scored in the 30th minute with a fine shot on the turn, two minutes before Nantes were reduced to 10 men when defender Nicolas Pallois picked up a second yellow card. 
Lille, who have been on and off form since the beginning of the season, looked like their 2020-21 selves in a dominant display at Rennes with Xeka and Renato Sanches scoring before the break. 
The big winners of the evening were Strasbourg, who crushed struggling Girondins Bordeaux 5-2 and sit sixth in the table, just above Monaco, 3-1 winners at Angers. 
Olympique Lyonnais are languishing in mid-table after suffering a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Reims, with Hugo Ekitike scoring an injury time winner for the away side following a mistake by goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. 
Montpellier moved into the top half of the table by downing lowly Metz 3-1, Brest won a fifth straight game by edging bottom side St Etienne 1-0 while Troyes snapped a three-game losing streak by defeating Lorient 2-0 to move three points above the relegation zone.

10,"Malik, Sarfaraz, Hasan rested for West Indies series",PCB will review the situation before deciding to appoint new coaches keeping in view the needs of the team after the series end.,"LAHORE: Veteran all-rounder Shoaib Malik, fast bowler Hasan Ali, all-rounder Imad Wasim and wicket-keeper Sarfaraz Ahmad were left out as the national selectors named on Thursday Pakistan’s ODI and Twenty20 squads for the home series against West Indies starting later this month. 
The series comprises three ODIs and as many T20 Inter­nationals all of which will be staged at the National Stadium, Karachi from Dec 13 to 22.
Four changes were made in the 18-member team, which played the T20 series in Bangladesh last month. Only pace bowler Mohammad Hasnain has been added to the 15-man T20 squad.
From the 17 players who were available for selection for the England ODIs in July, Asif Ali, Haider Ali, Iftikhar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah and Mohammad Wasim Junior have replaced Faheem Ashraf, Hasan, Salman Ali Agha and Sarfaraz in the 17-member side, while Abdullah Shafique has been named as a travelling reserve.
Meanwhile commenting on the squads, chief selector Mohammad Wasim said: “As we have been playing T20Is since October and now have a pretty settled and balanced side, we have decided to reduce the number of players to 15. As such, we have not included Imad Wasim, Sarfaraz Ahmed and Shoaib Malik.
“For the ODIs, which we last played in July, we have accepted the team management’s request and provided them two additional resources,” Wasim added.
“In consultation with [pace bowler] Hasan Ali and taking into consideration that he has been playing non-stop cricket since returning from a back injury, we have decided to give him time off from this series,” the chief selector concluded.
INTERIM COACHING SET-UP TO REMAIN
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided not to add any  batting or bowling coach to the interim coaching set-up of the national   team for the white-ball home series against the West Indies, it is learnt. 
When  contacted by Dawn, a PCB official said that after evaluating the situation in  detail, the PCB has decided not to appoint any batting or bowling coach  in place of Matthew Hayden (batting consultant) and Vernon Philander  (bowling consultant), who have left the Pakistan squad one after  another following their short assignments. Former Australian opener  Hayden and ex-South African pacer Philander had been hired ahead of the  T20 World Cup staged in the UAE during October-November. While  Hayden had left the Babar Azam-led team after the World Cup, Philander  left Bangladesh for South Africa after Pakistan’s first Test in Chittagong Test that ended  early this week.
Considering the home series against the West  Indies would be just a nine-day affair, adding any coach for such a short  period may not suit the winning combination of the Pakistan squad and  furthermore no one could serve the purpose in such a short time period,  the PCB official said.
However, he added, after the end of the  West Indies series, the PCB would review the situation before deciding  to appoint new coaches keeping in view the needs of the team.
Meanwhile, responding  to a question about non-payment to the contractual players of dome­stic  cricket for the last three months, the official said all the payments  would be made in the beginning of next week.
“It may not be necessary to appoint separate coaches for every department,” he said. “There is a possibility that the PCB will focus more on the junior teams by providing them with more coaches.”
Responding  to a question regarding selecting only one wicket-keeper for the West  Indies series, the official underlined as all the matches would be  played in  Karachi where Quaid-e-Azam Trophy matches are also going on,  so in case of an urgent requirement of the national team either Sarfaraz  Ahmad or Azam Khan would be easily available.
“The delay [in making  payments] occurred due to some administrative and clerical mistakes  which should not come to pass,” the PCB official stated.
Squads:
ODI: Babar Azam (captain), Shadab Khan (vice-captain), Asif Ali, Fakhar Zaman, Haider Ali, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Imam-ul-Haq, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Wasim Jr, Mohammad Hasnain, Saud Shakeel, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shahnawaz Dahani, Usman Qadir

KARACHI: Shabbir Iqbal attempts a putt during the second round of the Chairman JCSC Golf Championship at the Karachi Golf Course on Thursday.

 
KARACHI: With the direction of the wind changing, the fortunes of Ahmed Baig changed as well. 
During the past week, Ahmed has been out-of-sorts and struggled with his swing — first at the Sindh Gover­nor’s Cup at the DHA Golf Course and then in the first round of the Chairman JCSC Championship at the Karachi Golf Club on Wednesday. 
But as the winter winds blew across Karachi on Thursday, things fell in place for Ahmed. With two rounds to go, he’s firmly in contention for the title at the most lucrative tournament on the Pakistan golf circuit.“You have to adjust at the KGC,” he told Dawn after firing three birdies in a two-under 70 saw him move within two shots of the lead. “In the summers, the wind blows from right to left but in winters it changes direction so it becomes a challenge. 
“The way the KRC is designed, you have to try the fade shot in winters so that you’re able to find the greens. It worked out for me today.” 
A two-way tie at the top of the leaderboard sees Matloob Ahmed (72) and Mohammad Khalid (71) level at three-under 141, a stroke ahead of Talib Hussain (69), Minhaj Maqsood (72) and Mohammad Afzal (70). 
Four other golfers are level with Ahmed at 143, including Shabbir Iqbal (74) — the winner of the Governor’s Cup last week. 
Shabbir’s long-time rival Mohammad Munir (72) is in a group of eight at 144 while the joint-leaders at the end of the opening round, Waheed baloch and Mohammad Imran, both slipped five shots off the lead after returning a card of 76. 
Also on Thursday, the two-round senior professionals’ championship came to a thri­lling close as Naseer Khan and Mohammad Akram both fired rounds of 69 to finish level on seven-under 137 before the former prevailed in a playoff. 
The junior professionals’ event was won by Nabeel Khan (74) who finished on eight-over 152 to edge Moham­mad Saqib (76) by a shot. 
In the opening round of the amateurs’ competition, Yas­hal Shah shot a 72 to take a five-shot lead over Omar Khalid — the winner at the Gover­nor’s Cup — and Saim Shazli. 
Hamna Amjad (73) closed the penultimate round of the women’s amateurs at 158 for a four-shot lead over Daniya Syed (81). 
The ladies’ contest began on Thursday with Humera Khalid (80) taking a four-stroke lead over Tabassum Sharif. 
Khurram Khan (75) has a similar lead over Ahmed Jamil Siddiqi after the first round of the senior amateurs.

12,Dhananjaya De Silva dampens West Indies hopes of first Test win in Sri Lanka,Sri Lanka finished on 328 for eight at stumps and are ahead by 279 runs. No team has chased that many to win a Test in Galle.,"GALLE: Dhananjaya de Silva ended the West Indies’ hopes of a maiden win on Sri Lankan soil with a brilliant six-hour spell at the crease to finish day four with an unbeaten 153 here at the Galle International Stadium on Thursday.
The tourists went wicketless through the final session, with Lasith Embuldeniya rounding out a record 107-run partnership.
Sri Lanka finished on 328 for eight at stumps and are ahead by 279 runs. No team has chased that many to win a Test match in Galle.
“A target close to 300 runs is a little bit difficult especially on a wicket that is tough to bat on,” said West Indies coach Phil Simmons.
“De Silva batted really well and there was one chance and we couldn’t hold on. He played us out of the game.”
De Silva’s back to the wall knock helped the hosts out of trouble when he walked in to bat at 73-3, a lead of just 24.
Having first put up a 78-run stand with overnight batsman Pathum Nissanka, de Silva then went on to eke out a crucial partnership of 51 with Ramesh Mendis.
It was de Silva’s eighth Test ton and the 30-year-old ticked over 150 in style by driving Nkrumah Bonner for four.
The West Indies were ruing a dropped catch off de Silva when he was on five, with wicket-keeper Joshua Da Silva spilling the chance. The batsman made the tourists pay with an excellent counterattack.
To add insult to injury, Veerasammy Permaul dropped de Silva off his own bowling when he was on 116.
The West Indies trail the two-Test series 0-1. The highest successful run chase in Galle is 268 by Sri Lanka in 2019 against New Zealand.
The tourists introduced pace to unsettle the batsmen, but with a couple of pulled boundaries off Kemar Roach, de Silva ensured that Sri Lanka had the momentum.
Opener Nissanka, playing just his sixth Test match, posted his third half-century in the series with a conservative approach. Nissanka made 66 before a Roston Chase delivery saw him dismissed on the last ball before lunch.
Mendis then lost his wicket and Angelo Mathews — struggling with a hamstring injury — came into bat at the fall of the seventh wicket. He managed just one run.

13,Kohli declares Wriddhiman Saha fit for second NZ Test,"“Saha is fit as of now and he has completely recovered from the neck niggle or spasm that he was suffering from,” says Kohli.","MUMBAI: India wicket-keeper Wriddhiman Saha has recovered from a neck problem and is available for selection for the second and final Test against New Zealand, captain Virat Kohli said on Thursday.
Saha was unable to don the wicket-keeping gloves on the final day of the first Test in Kanpur due to a stiff neck with K.S. Bharat taking his place behind the stumps during the drawn Test.
“Saha is fit as of now and he has completely recovered from the neck niggle or spasm that he was suffering from,” Kohli told reporters before the Wankhede Stadium Test starting on Friday.
Kohli himself skipped the three-match Twenty20 series and the opening Test against New Zealand to take a rest.
While Kohli’s return will be a welcome boost for India’s batting, it will also leave them with a selection headache.
In Kohli’s absence, Mumbai batter Shreyas Iyer made a dream test debut with a first-innings 105 followed by a crucial 65 in the second in Kanpur.
Calls have grown to drop either Ajinkya Rahane, who led India in Kanpur, or Cheteshwar Pujara -- both of whom have been short of runs -- to vacate a spot for Kohli and allow Iyer to retain his place.
Unseasonable rain in Mumbai has also meant that both teams have not been able to practise outdoors since Wednesday and the weather conditions could have an impact on the team selection, according to Kohli.
“We will discuss our combination. The change in weather and the change in conditions have to be taken into account,” he said, adding that he expected the Wankhede Stadium pitch to have something on offer for batters and bowlers.
“But we also can’t assume that the weather will remain the same for the next five days. So we have to have a combination which can adapt to any change.”
New Zealand have never won a Test series in India, let alone a Test match since the 1988-89 tour.
The top-ranked Black Caps, who beat India in a June contest in Southampton to win the inaugural World Test Championship, have a chance to make history with a win in Mumbai.
“We gained a lot out of our efforts in Kanpur [Test],” New Zealand’s pace speahead Tim Southee said.  “We’re just looking forward to a new challenge here in Mumbai.”
Squads:
INDIA: Virat Kohli (captain), Ajinkya Rahane, Suryakumar Yadav, Mayank Agarwal,  Cheteshwar Pujara, Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, Wriddhiman Saha, KS  Bharat, Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Axar Patel, Jayant Yadav,  Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna
NEW ZEALAND: Kane Williamson, Tom Blundell, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Henry  Nicholls, Daryl Mitchell, Ajaz Patel, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra,  Mitchell Santner, Will Somerville, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Will Young,  Neil Wagner.
