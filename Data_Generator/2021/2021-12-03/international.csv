0,World Bank backs using $280m in frozen funds for Afghanistan,"Afghan experts have said the aid would help, but big questions remain, including how to get funds into Afghanistan.","WASHINGTON: The World Bank’s board has backed transferring $280 million from a frozen trust fund to two aid agencies to help Afghanistan cope with a brewing humanitarian crisis after the US withdrawal, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The 31 donors to the World Bank-administered Afghanistan Recons­truction Trust Fund (ARTF) must approve the transfer before the funds could flow to the World Food Programme and Unicef, the sources said. The donors were expected to meet on Friday, the sources said.
The World Bank board met informally on Tuesday to discuss transferring up to $500 million of the $1.5 billion in the ARTF to humanitarian aid agencies, people familiar with the plan said.
Afghanistan’s 39 million people face a cratering economy, a winter of food shortages and growing poverty three months after the Taliban seized power as the last US troops withdrew from 20 years of war.
Afghan experts have said the aid would help, but big questions remain, including how to get funds into Afghanistan without exposing any financial institutions involved to US sanctions.
While the US Treasury has provided “comfort letters” assuring banks that they can process humanitarian transactions, concern about US sanctions continues to prevent passage of even basic supplies, including food and medicine.
Any decision to redirect ARTF money requires the approval of all its donors, of which the United States has been the largest.
The White House and the Treasury had no immediate comment on the World Bank board’s endorsement of transferring the funds to the World Food Programme and Unicef.
A World Bank spokesperson confirmed the bank’s board had discussed the issue and that the donors were to meet on Friday.
The board “discussed an approach to transfer out funds from the ... ARTF to humanitarian aid agencies with presence and logistics on the ground to enable basic humanitarian support directly to the people in the country,” the spokesperson said. “The ARTF Donors Steering Committee is scheduled to meet on Dec 3 to consider transfers out from the fund.”

2,"‘Walls of fear’, nationalism slow Europe’s progress, warns Pope","“We need to welcome and integrate one another, and to walk together as brothers and sisters, all of us,” says Pope Francis.","NICOSIA: Pope Francis said on Thursday that “walls of fear” and nationalism were slowing down Europe’s progress, speaking on a visit to Cyprus, a frontline nation in the continent’s migrant crisis.
“The European continent needs reconciliation and unity; it needs courage and enthusiasm if it is to move forward... for it will not be the walls of fear and the vetoes dictated by nationalist interests that ensure its progress,” he said in Nicosia.
Pope Francis called for unity as Europe deals with the arrival of refugees and migrants, speaking on the divided Mediterranean island of Cyprus, a major destination for people fleeing war and poverty.
“We need to welcome and integrate one another, and to walk together as brothers and sisters, all of us,” said the pontiff, 84, at the start of a five-day trip that from Saturday takes him on to Greece.
Speaking in a Maronite church in the Cypriot capital Nicosia, the pope said “the presence of many of our migrant brothers and sisters” had made Cyprus “a true point of encounter between different ethnicities and cultures”.
The island’s experience served as a reminder to Europe that “we need to work together to build a future worthy of humanity, to overcome divisions, to break down walls, to dream and work for unity,” he said.
Speaking of religious diversity in Cyprus, he said: “We should not experience diversity as a threat to identity. We should not be jealous or defensive”.
Pope Francis — on his 35th international trip since becoming pope in 2013 — is the second Catholic pontiff to set foot on Cyprus after Benedict XVI visited in 2010.
The country of one million has a Catholic minority of about 25,000, among them Maronites whose ancestors arrived from Syria and Leba­non, and overseas workers from the Philippines, South Asia and African countries.
“We’re such a small minority so it’s great to feel that you belong to a greater family, the Catholic family,” said Eliana Maltezou, 38, holding her one-year-old son Pavlo, and waving a small Cypriot flag.
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish forces invaded and occupied the island’s northern third in response to a coup sponsored by the Greek junta in power at the time.
Only Ankara recognises the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and tensions simmer between the two sides.
The division saw about 200,000 people, including many Maronites from the north, displaced from their homes.
Maronite Monica Despoti, 55, whose village Asomatos remains in the occupied north, said the pope’s visit meant “we’re very, very happy and we also have a hope that with his help we can go back to our motherland.
“We want so badly to go back to our villages to live there and for us it is a hope that we are having the pope here with us.” The majority-Greek speaking south accuses the north of sending migrants across the UN-patrolled Green Line and also says that it receives the highest number of first-time asylum seekers of any EU member country.
The pope has long called for better protection for migrants. In a video message ahead of the trip, Francis described the Mediterranean as a “huge cemetery” for migrants who drowned.
“We know that Pope Francis goes above all to the most vulnerable and marginalised,” the Maronite archbishop of Cyprus, Selim Sfeir, said.

3,"Taliban, Myanmar junta condemn move to deny their envoys seats at UN",Two diplomats say there was a “consensus” within the UN credentials committee to delay the decision.,"YANGON: Myanmar’s junta and the Taliban authorities of Afghanistan on Thursday slammed the United Nations for denying their chosen representatives seats at the world body.
The committee responsible for approving nominations of ambassadors met on Wednesday but deferred a decision over rival claims to the seats for both countries, diplomats said.
The deferral keeps in place envoys appointed to the UN by former governments in both nations before they were toppled — by a coup in Myanmar in February and the Taliban’s takeover in Afghanistan in August.
“This decision does not reflect the reality on the ground and existence of our country,” Myanmar junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said.
“We will continue submitting (to the UN) as usual according to diplomatic procedure and the right to representation in accordance with international and local laws,” he added.
The deferral leaves Kyaw Moe Tun, appointed by Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, in place as Myanmar’s envoy.
He made headlines shortly after the putsch by flashing the three-finger salute of democracy protesters from his UN chair, brazenly defying the junta’s insistence that he no longer represents the country.
In August US prosecutors said they had charged two Myanmar citizens in a plot to attack him. The junta has denied any involvement and chosen former soldier Aung Thurein as its envoy to the UN body.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy government, sparking huge democracy protests which have triggered a bloody crackdown from the junta.
The Taliban in September asked the UN to accept its former Doha-based spokesperson Suhail Shaheen to succeed Ghulam Isaczai, a cabinet member of ousted President Ashraf Ghani.
Shaheen on Twitter said the UN had “deprived the people of Afghan­istan of their legitimate right”.
“We have the support of the people of Afghanistan and we are able to defend the country, the people and all the borders,” he said.
Isaczai continues to occupy Afghanistan’s offices at the UN headquarters and participated in a recent Security Council meeting in which he openly criticised the Taliban.
The Taliban have been seeking international recognition for their new government as the country faces worsening economic and humanitarian disasters.
There was “consensus” within the UN credentials committee to delay the decision, two diplomats said.
“China, Russia and the United States were in the same position,” one of them said.
The nine-member committee is due to submit a report next week to the General Assembly, diplomats said.

4,US defence chief slams China’s drive for hypersonic weapons,"SEOUL: America’s defence chief rebuked China on Thursday, vowing to confront its potential military threats in ...","SEOUL: America’s defence chief rebuked China on Thursday, vowing to confront its potential military threats in Asia and warning that its pursuit of hypersonic weapons intended to evade US missile defences increases tensions in the region.
US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin’s stern comments after annual security talks with South Korea, a top US ally, are a window into one of the Biden administration’s top foreign policy worries: How should Washington and its partners contain a Chinese military that is strengthening both in sheer firepower and in confidence as it pursues an end of American dominance in Asia?
China sees much of Asia as its natural sphere of influence. But many in the region warn of a pattern of Chinese interference, accompanied by moves to acquire the weapons needed to dominate its rivals. Austin’s comments were directed at China’s July test of a hypersonic weapon capable of partially orbiting Earth before reentering the atmosphere and gliding on a maneuverable path to its target.
Experts say the weapons system is clearly designed to evade US missile defences, although China insisted it was testing a reusable space vehicle, not a missile.
We have concerns about the military capabilities that the PRC continues to pursue, and the pursuit of those capabilities increases tensions in the region, Austin said about the hypersonic weapons test, using the abbreviation for the Peoples Republic of China, the country’s official name.
Well continue to maintain the capabilities to defend and deter against a range of potential threats from the PRC to ourselves and to our allies, he said.
The Pentagon released on Monday the results of a global posture review that calls for additional cooperation with allies to deter potential Chinese military aggression and threats from North Korea.
Last month, Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States is also working on hypersonic weapons. But there is worry in Washington that it is lagging behind China and Russia in pursuing these types of weapons. Russia said its navy successfully tested a prospective hypersonic cruise missile.
Hypersonic weapons, which fly at speeds in excess of Mach 5, or five times the speed of sound, could pose crucial challenges to missile defence systems because of their speed and maneuverability. But some experts argue that hypersonic weapons would add little to Americas ability to deter war and worry that they could trigger a new, destabilising arms race. Austin also addressed another major US worry: North Korea.
He said that he agreed with South Korean Defence Minister Suh Wook that the North’s growing weapons programme is increasingly destabilising for regional security.” Austin said the allies remain committed to a diplomatic approach to North Korea.
Suh said the two agreed on a document updating joint contingency plans in the event of a war on the peninsula to reflect changes in North Korean threats and other conditions, but didn’t elaborate on the document’s details.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal is believed to have grown significantly in recent years.
After a series of high-profile missile and nuclear tests in 2016-17, North Korea claimed to have the ability to launch nuclear strikes on the American homeland. According to a 2018 South Korean estimate, North Korea has built up to 60 nuclear weapons.

VIENTIANE: Laos held a Buddhist ceremony on Thursday to bless its new $6 billion high-speed rail line, a Chinese-led initiative that marks one of the biggest leaps towards modernisation by one of Asia’s least-developed nations.
The rail connects China’s southeastern city of Kunming to the Laos capital Vientiane, stretching more than 1,000 km, and traversing mountains ranges and water systems.
Laos state news agency KPL on Thursday said the project was part of the government’s strategy to convert Laos “from a landlocked country to a land-linked one”.
The rail line, which China hopes to eventually extend to Singapore, is part of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
On Lao National Day on Thursday, Buddhist monks chanted at a new railway platform and blessed a train car with water and auspicious markings ahead of Friday’s official opening. With a population of 7 million and gross domestic product of just $18 billion in 2019, communist Laos is one of Asia’s poorest nations.
Economists have warned the rail project could complicate its challenges in repaying external debt, much of it to China.
China holds a 70pc stake in the rail joint venture established in 2015.
Total investment was 50.55 billion yuan ($7.93 billion), according to an article by China’s Belt and Road Portal earlier this year. KPL put the value at $5.98 billion.
For Nokphone Photsavang, 35, who works in the hotel sector, the rail project will be a boon for Laos.
“I believe the railway will bring a lot of opportunities and I’m looking forward to the economic growth,” Nokphone said. “It also eases travel between towns and will bring families closer together.”

6,"Armed man outside UN HQ prompts standoff, lockdown",People inside UN headquarters were initially told to shelter in place but were later allowed to move about the complex.,"NEW YORK: The United Nations headquarters in New York City was locked down for several hours on Thursday after a man was seen pacing outside one of its main gates with what police said appeared to be a shotgun.
Police negotiators were speaking with the man, who appeared to be in his 60s, and hoped to resolve the situation peacefully, NYPD spokespeople said.
Police said there was no danger to the public. People inside UN headquarters were initially told to shelter in place, but were later allowed to move about the complex and come and go from other entrances.
The UN General Assembly and Security Council were both in session Thursday.
The man was first spotted around 10:30am outside a security checkpoint on Manhattan’s 1st Avenue, police said.
Videos posted on social media showed the man pacing outside the fence that rings the complex, carrying an object, possibly a firearm, pointed at his own throat.
The gates were closed and the person didn’t appear to be trying to breach the security perimeter.
Numerous police UN spokesperson Stphane Dujarric said there was zero indication the man was a current or former UN employee.

7,Erdogan removes finance minister as Turkey’s lira crashes,The Turkish currency has lost about 40 per cent of its value since the start of the year.,"ANKARA: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appointed a new treasury and finance minister on Thursday after the previous one stepped down as the country’s currency has tumbled to record lows.
Erdogan named deputy minister Nureddin Nebati to the post, according to an announcement published in the Official Gazette. It said Lutfi Elvan asked to be pardoned from the job and that his request was accepted.
His resignation comes as the Turkish lira has been plummeting to successive all-time lows over concerns about the government’s economic policy. The lira’s plunge follows a series of cuts in borrowing costs despite soaring consumer prices that have made it difficult for people to buy food and other products.
The Turkish currency has lost about 40pc of its value since the start of the year.
Erdogan strongly argues that high interest rates cause inflation contrary to conventional economic thinking and has made clear that the country would press ahead with rate cuts.
Nebati, 57, who has a doctorate in political science and public administration, is known to be a supporter of Erdogan’s drive to reduce interest rates even with inflation running at around 20pc.
Nebati said that high interest rates would not be a priority.

8,Twitter shuts down ‘propaganda accounts’ in six countries,"Says vast majority of accounts were part of a network that “amplified Chinese Communist Party narratives"".","SAN FRANCISCO: Twitter said on Thursday it had shut down nearly 3,500 accounts that were posting pro-government propaganda in six countries, including China and Russia.
The vast majority of the accounts were part of a network that “amplified Chinese Communist Party narratives related to the treatment of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang”, Twitter said in a statement.
China faces accusations of human rights violations against the ethnic minority in the northwestern province.
Aside from 2,048 accounts linked to the pro-Beijing campaign, Twitter also shut down 112 accounts connected to a company named Changyu Culture, linked to Xinjiang’s regional government.
The move came a day after Facebook’s parent company Meta said it had shut down more than 500 accounts that were part of a China-linked influence campaign relating to Covid-19.
The accounts promoted claims from a reportedly fictitious Swiss biologist, Wilson Edwards, that the United States was interfering in efforts to identify the origins of the coronavirus.
Both Twitter and Facebook are banned in China, but Beijing frequently uses both US social networks to promote its positions on the international stage.
Twitter also shuttered 16 accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company labelled a “troll farm” by critics, which runs pro-government online influence campaigns.
“The operation relied on a mix of inauthentic and real accounts to introduce a pro-Russia viewpoint into Central African political discourse,” Twitter said.
Russia has wielded increasing influence in the Central African Republic since 2018 when it sent a large contingent of “instructors” to train the army.
“We also removed a network of 50 accounts that attacked the civilian Libyan government and actors that support it, while voicing significant support for Russia’s geopolitical position in Libya and Syria,” Twitter added.

9,"Israel didn’t probe shootings that killed 200 Palestinians, says report",JERUSALEM: Rights groups said on Thursday that Israel failed to investigate shootings that killed more than 200...,"JERUSALEM: Rights groups said on Thursday that Israel failed to investigate shootings that killed more than 200 Palestinians and wounded thousands at protests along the Gaza frontier in recent years, strengthening the case for the International Criminal Court to intervene.
The Israeli military rejected the findings, claiming the “mass riots” organised by Gaza’s Hamas rulers were aimed at providing cover for cross-border attacks. The military said alleged abuses were thoroughly investigated, with soldiers held accountable.
Beginning in March 2018, Gaza activists organised weekly protests that were initially aimed at highlighting the plight of Palestinian refugees from what is now Israel, who make up three-fourths of Gaza’s population of more than two million people.
But Hamas soon co-opted the protests and used them to push for the easing of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade imposed on the territory when the group seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007, according to critics.
Every week for around 18 months, thousands of Palestinians gathered at different points along the frontier. Groups of protesters burned tyres, and hurled stones and firebombs.
Israeli snipers fired live ammunition, rubber-coated bullets and tear gas from sand berms on the other side in what Israel claimed was self-defence, to prevent thousands of Palestinians from rushing into Israel.
Israeli fire killed at least 215 Palestinians, most of them unarmed, including 47 people under the age of 18 and two women, according to Gaza’s Al-Mezan Centre for Human Rights. Hundreds of others were seriously wounded in the demonstrations, which wound down in late 2019.
Many were far from the border fence when they were shot. An Israeli soldier was killed by a Palestinian sniper in 2018 and several others were wounded.
A report released on Thursday by the Israeli rights group B’Tselem and the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights said the military failed to investigate orders issued by senior commanders and took virtually no action against any soldiers.
As of April, out of 143 cases transferred to military prosecutors by an Israeli fact-finding mechanism, 95 were closed with no further action. Only one case, the killing of a 14-year-old Palestinian, led to an indictment, with the remainder still pending, the report said.
It cited figures obtained from the Israeli military through a freedom of information request.
The indicted soldier was convicted of abuse of authority to the point of endangering life or health in a plea bargain and sentenced to one month of community service, the report said.

10,US and Iran voice pessimism about revival of nuclear deal,"""Recent moves, recent rhetoric, don’t give us a lot of cause for ... optimism,” says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.","VIENNA: The United States and Iran both sounded pessimistic on Thursday about the chances of reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, with Washington saying it had little cause for optimism and Tehran questioning the determination of US and European negotiators.
“I have to tell you, recent moves, recent rhetoric, don’t give us a lot of cause for ... optimism,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters in Stockholm, saying he could judge in a day or so if Iran would engage in good faith.
Blinken made the comments after Iran provided the European powers who are shuttling between US and Iranian officials in Vienna with drafts on sanctions removal and nuclear commitments, as world powers and Tehran seek to reinstate the tattered pact.
“We went to Vienna with serious determination, but we are not optimistic about the will and the intention of the United States and the three European parties to the deal,” Iranian foreign minister Hossein Amirabdollahian was quoted by Iranian media as saying in a telephone conversation with his Japanese counterpart.
While Blinken said “it is not too late for Iran to reverse course and engage meaningfully,” it appeared as if both sides might be seeking to avoid the blame if the talks break down.
The comments came on the fourth day of indirect US-Iran talks on bringing both nations fully back into the deal, under which Iran limited its nuclear programme in return for relief from US, European Union and UN economic sanctions. The talks resumed on Monday after a five-month hiatus prompted by Iran’s election of an anti-Western hardliner as president.
The UN nuclear watchdog said on Wednesday that Iran has started producing enriched uranium with advanced centrifuges at its Fordow plant dug into a mountain, further eroding the nuclear deal during talks with the West on saving it.
“What Iran can’t do is sustain the status quo of building their nuclear program while dragging their feet on talks. That will not happen,” Blinken told reporters in Stockholm in a possible reference to that development.
It was unclear whether Blinken had been briefed on the latest proposals by the Iranians when he made his comments.
“We have delivered two proposed drafts to them ... Of course they need to check the texts that we have provided to them. If they are ready to continue the talks, we are in Vienna to continue the talks,” Iran’s chief nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani told reporters in the Austrian capital. A European diplomat in Vienna confirmed draft documents had been handed over.
Under the pact, Tehran limited its uranium enrichment programme, a potential pathway to nuclear weapons though Iran says it seeks only civilian atomic energy, in exchange for relief from the economic sanctions.
But in 2018, then-US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal, calling it too soft on Iran, and reimposed harsh U.S. sanctions, spurring Tehran to breach nuclear limits in the pact.
“We want all sanctions to be lifted at once,” Bagheri told reporters. He said an Iranian proposal regarding how to verify the removal of sanctions — Tehran’s overriding priority in the talks — would be handed over to the European parties later.

11,67 countries reach ‘historic’ deal on trade in services,Trade in services has grown significantly over past decade and WTO now estimates that it accounts for around half of world trade.,"GENEVA: A group of 67 countries, including the United States, China and EU members, reached a deal at the World Trade Organisation on Thursday on facilitating trade in services.
The countries, which account for just over a third of all WTO members but represent 90 percent of global trade in services, concluded the accord after four years of negotiations.
WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala hailed the deal as “historic”, pointing to estimates that it would lower the costs associated with the services trade by as much as $150 billion each year.
Faced with WTO’s long-time failure to conclude multilateral trade deals among all 164 members, smaller numbers of countries have increasingly moved to plurilateral negotiations in a bid to move forward in areas including domestic services regulation.
Washington hailed Thursday’s deal in a statement, saying it would “improve the transparency and fairness of processes for obtaining authorisations to provide services by professionals and firms in a wide array of fields.” “This initiative is the first successful WTO services negotiation in years, and shows how WTO members can take practical, common sense steps to address clearly defined trade problems,” US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement. EU Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis also hailed the “groundbreaking” deal, tweeting that it would “cut red tape in services trade.”
Trade in services has grown significantly over the past decade and the WTO now estimates that it accounts for around half of world trade. However, trade in services costs are about twice that of trade in goods.
A significant portion of the costs is attributable to regulatory differences as well as opaque regulations and burdensome procedures.
WTO members are free to regulate their service sectors, but starting in 2017, the growing group of countries has worked towards developing good regulatory practices so as not to restrict trade unnecessarily.
