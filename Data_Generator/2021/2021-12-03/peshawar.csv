0,Covid vaccination push planned through cash prizes for health workers in KP,A summary has been sent to the chief minister in this regard.,"PESHAWAR: The health department has proposed cash prizes for the ‘best performers’ in the Covid-19 vaccination campaigns to boost up immunisation in 20 districts, where the percentage of eligible people getting vaccine shots is below 50.
A report of the department revealed that 11.45 million people had so far been vaccinated against the virus by Nov 30.
According to it, 46.32 per cent of the total targeted 24.71m people aged between 12 years and above 70 years have received vaccine jabs.
Upper Chitral district has 73.28pc eligible people fully vaccinated against coronavirus, Lower Chitral 60.83pc, Haripur 53.62pc and Kurram 50.95pc, while the percentage in the other 24 districts is below the targeted 50.
A total of 17.79pc vaccination coverage was reported in Upper Kohistan, 12.39pc in South Waziristan and 11.67pc in Kolai-Palas.

Secy also promises action over laxity by vaccinators

Meanwhile, health secretary Mohammad Tahir Orakzai told Dawn that a summary had been sent to the chief minister to give away cash prizes to the best performers in the Covid-19 vaccination drive to motivate others and thus, increasing the vaccination rates.
He said the workers got low salaries but worked wholeheartedly for the success of the vaccination campaign and therefore, cash prizes had been proposed to motivate them and others to increase vaccination coverage.
“We [health department] have proposed the payment of Rs3,000 per week to the ‘best vaccinators’ selected after a performance review,” he said.
The secretary said the Covid-19 vaccination had slowed down due to the involvement of the health workers in the recently-concluded measles and rubella vaccination campaign.
“Now once the measles and rubella drive is over, we have planned to give Covid-19 vaccine shots to 200,000 people in the province every day,” he said.
Mr Orakzai said the government schools had been very cooperative for the vaccination of their students and employees.
He said around 50 per cent of the targeted people were schoolchildren and the vaccination problems were reported in private schools.
“Covid-19 immunisation is mandatory and all eligible people have to receive jabs,” he said.
The secretary said the department’s officials had met the top officials of the Private Schools Regulatory Authority as part of efforts to vaccinate more and more children in private educational institutions.
He said the province had enough vaccine stock and was spending huge sums of money on storage and related facilities.
“We need to protect the lives of people from Covid-19, which has killed 5,851 people and infected 180,146 people in the province. We have recruited 1,700 more health workers to speed up immunisation, especially in the districts, where the vaccination rates are very low,” he said.
Mr Orakzai said Covid-19 vaccination campaigns were monitored online from the health secretariat to ensure its smooth progress.
“The inoculation exercise will continue until the infection is there. The people can be protected against the virus only through jabs provided free of charge at over 700 centres in the province,” he said.
The secretary said a mechanism had also been introduced enduring that the district administration led the campaigns in collaboration with the health and other departments and reach the targeted population.
He said the people, who had received the first Covid-19 vaccine dose, should get the second one as well to ensure their protection against the virus.
Mr Orakzai said the department had planned a Covid-19 performance review meeting after three days and would look into the issues slowing down immunisation and the ways to create demand for immunisation.
He said health workers showing laxity in the vaccination campaigns would face disciplinary action.
APP adds: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa health minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra on Thursday said the department had improved the capacity of hospitals in the province and was ready to deal with Omicron variant of coronavirus.
The minister told reporters after the two-day KP Business Expo at the University of Peshawar here that coronavirus vaccination campaign was in full swing and the government was set to deal with any emergency situation related to Omicron.
“We are making all-out efforts to vaccinate majority of population against coronavirus and thus, enabling them to fight Omicron variant,” he said.
The minister said a special vaccination programme had been planned to administer vaccine to unvaccinated people.

5,Gas outages irk domestic consumers in Swabi,People say they are forced to buy food from bazaar...,"SWABI: The loadshedding and low pressure of natural gas have caused great hardships to consumers in the district.
Since the commencement of the winter, complaints of low gas pressure have been poured in from all the areas including rural and urban.
The low gas pressure has forced the consumers to use liquid petroleum gas (LPG) and wood or buy food at the bazaar. “All these alternatives are costly on one hand and use of LPG is risky on the other but there is no other option,” said the consumers.
They said that traders increased the price of wood by Rs200 per 50 kilograms when they came to know about the low gas pressure in the district.

People say they are forced to buy food from bazaar

“I have purchased fuel wood at Rs700 per 50 kilograms instead of Rs500. When I wanted to know the reason for the increase, the dealer told me to buy wood from another trader,’ said Aamir Khan of Maneri Bala village.
The consumers said that owing to gas outages, they were forced to arrange food from local hotels and buy bread from tandoor owners, who reduced the size of bread.
They said that their preparing lunch or dinner had become an uphill task owing to gas outages and low pressure. “The most difficult task is to make breakfast for the children because they leave for schools and colleges in time. The gas outage has made the mothers helpless,” Dr Shahzad Khan told this scribe.
The residents of the district complained that despite their repeated requests and contacts, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) failed to give any heed to their genuine demand.
About the issue, a local university has issued a letter, which says that as per government’s announcement the gas pressure has been adjusted by SNGPL to meet the country-wide requirements. 
It is beyond the control of a local management to improve the gas pressure, it adds.
The letter has advised the consumers to organise all the kitchen activities keeping in mind the gas pressure available for domestic use. 
They are also advised to be specifically careful not to leave the gas appliances switched on unattended. It is quite possible that there may be a total cutoff at a certain time and restoration in a short span, thereby, causing accumulation of unburned gas at that location that may result in an unwarranted situation subsequently, it adds.

PESHAWAR: Veteran Pashto film director Mumtaz Ali Khan passed away in his Lahore residence, family sources confirmed on Thursday. He was 74.
The noted director is said to have been suffering from multiple health issues for quite some time. 
He left behind two daughters, four sons and a widow to mourn his death. He was laid to rest in Lahore the same day. Artists, fans and relatives attended his funeral prayers.
The artists of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa widely condoled his death and sympathised with the bereaved family.
Mumtaz Ali Khan was born in Pabbi, Nowshera district, in 1947. He qualified 10th grade from his village government high school. 
He was admitted to Edwardes College Peshawar but he could not complete his education due to financial constraints. He got employment with known actor Rangeela in Lahore studio who explored a director in the young film fan.
Mr Khan started his career in 1963 with Rangeela and proved himself an excellent director and came up with supper hit Urdu and Punjabi films including Diya Aur Toofan, Dil Aur Dunya , Dulhan Ek Raat Ki, Teri Qasam and a few others. However, he became a brand name after he directed Pashto film ‘Darra Khyber’ released in December 1971 followed by Orbal, Khanabadosh, Deedan, Jawargar, Naway Da Yway Shpay and Rahmdad Khan.
Pashto movies reigned over hearts of Pakhtun viewers due to Mumtaz Ali Khan’s superb direction, characterised by quality contents including music and beautiful locations coupled with excellent camera shoot.
Like his ideal hero, Dillip Kumar, he strongly believed in quality rather than quantity. He was responsible for introducing noted actors including Waheeda Khan, Asif Khan, Suriya Khan, Ismail Shah, Musarrat Shaheen and Humayun Qureshi. Also, he enjoyed the unique talent to have had pioneered double version trend in pollywood industry. Bangree Au Hatkarrai, Zakhooma, Qanoon, Qaidi, Da Dako Loor and Dukhmani were among other super hits released between early 80s and late 90s.
The noted director could gift only 50 top Pashto flicks to pollywood industry as he called it a day after Pashto cinema declined to sponsor quality productions and devoted his rest of life to religious activities.

Addressing a news conference here, ANP district general secretary Nisar Baz Khan and deputy general secretary Sayed Sadiq Akbar, who is also running for Khar tehsil chairman, said their party had welcomed the holding of the local body elections in the tribal district as it was one of the main components of the 25th Constitutional Amendment, which merged tribal areas with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in May 2018.
They said the local body system was imperative for the region’s speedy and sustainable development to ensure the provision of basic facilities of life to the residents.

ANP leaders seek intervention of authorities

They alleged that the local PTI lawmakers were trying to influence the upcoming local body elections by canvassing for the nominees of their party in the district.
The ANP leaders insisted that the PTI assembly members were participating in elections campaigns of the candidates and announcing development projects for constituencies in a clear violation of the code of conduct formulated by the Election Commission of Pakistan for local body elections.
They urged the relevant authorities to immediately take note of the matter to ensure free and fair electoral exercise.

Addressing the students and faculty at the Army Burn Hall College for Boys here, the president said all necessary ingredients for the making of a developed and prosperous Pakistan were in place, but there was a need to exhibit unity and discipline. 
He said that nations were not built on the basis of resources, but determination, resilience and moral character. He expressed his strong faith that following the same spirit, Pakistan would emerge as a strong country in the comity of nations. 
President Alvi said that for students both home and school contributed to their character building with its impact on society. 
However, he said that with changing times the modes of acquiring knowledge were also shifting from books to electronic gadgets to access cloud information. 
He said the importance of character building of youth had increased manifold amid challenges such as the influence of foreign culture. 
President Alvi said as the West turned a blind eye to the migrants, Pakistan proudly championed the cause of humanitarian approach by hosting four million refugees from Afghanistan for the last four decades. 
He said that Pakistan’s culture of humanity and care for the underprivileged was grounded in the teachings of Islam. Besides focusing on academics, the president said sports and physical activities played a significant role in inculcating the values of courage and discipline among students.

They said four passengers were being huddled up on seats with the capacity for three in flying coaches on Peshawar, Bannu, Rawalpindi, and Hangu routes. 
The drivers and station managers forced 18 people on seats made for 15 passengers and thus they collected Rs600-1,200 more from each side depending on routes. 
Haji Adeel, who regularly travels on business trips to Peshawar and on local routes, regretted that the Suzuki and pickup van drivers seated more than 20 passengers on the seats made for 16. He said the drivers also allowed passengers to sit on roofs of their vans on the local routes. 
He said that on inter-district routes the passengers were seated shoulder to shoulder, which caused suffocation on long journeys. 
Reacting to the complaints by hundreds of passengers on the Citizen’s Portal against an unrealistic rise in fares, RTA secretary Mr Samiullah had doubled the fine for violation of rules by drivers on the local and inter-district routes. 
Speaking at a press conference along with chief traffic warden Faheem Bangash on Thursday, the secretary said they had called the meeting of all the drivers and bus stand owners and briefed them about the government fixed fares. 
However, he regretted that despite that the drivers raised the fares on their own. 
The traffic warden said the fares were never implemented rather the drivers increased passengers by seating four of them on seats reserved for only three. 
The secretary said they had fixed the fare of Rs1.43 per mile per passenger for local transport, while the fines had been increased for traffic rules violations.

The demand was made during an emergency meeting held in Mingora. The meeting was attended by the civil society members and members of Swat Traders Federation (STF).
They said that Wapda was collecting taxes in the electricity bills from the people of Swat and other districts of Malakand division, which was not legal. 
They said that Malakand division including district Swat was exempted from all kinds of taxes as it was tax-free zone.
“Constitutionally, the entire Malakand division is tax-free zone where no department or organisation can collect taxes but Wapda is collecting taxes in the electricity bills which is illegal. We reject any illegal activity in Swat,” said Abdur Rahim Khan, president of STF.
He said that a jirga and all-party conference would be called to make final decision against illegal collection of taxes in the bills if Wapda did not stop collecting taxes. The civil society members also opposed tax collection in the bills and said that people of Malakand suffered a lot in the recent past but the government, instead of giving them relief, was putting burden on them.
“For some months, I have been receiving my electricity bills with additional taxes. This month I have received my bill in which Rs846 is a tax, which is not legal in Swat. I am a poor labourer and can hardly manage to meet my food expenses. I cannot pay the heavy electricity bill,” said Suleman Khan, a resident of Amankot.
