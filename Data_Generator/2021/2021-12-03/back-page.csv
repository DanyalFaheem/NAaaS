0,Billion Tree Tsunami project being probed: NAB chief,Claims bureau has summoned ‘sacred cows’ —  something that was impossible in the past.,"PESHAWAR: National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman retired justice Javed Iqbal on Thursday said that the anti-graft watchdog was investigating the PTI government’s much-touted Billion Tree Tsunami afforestation programme.
The afforestation programme launched during the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)’s previous tenure in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had cost the province Rs17 billion.
During his visit to the NAB KP office, Justice Iqbal scoffed at critics for not pursuing PTI government-linked cases, saying the Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) case was sub judice.
He said that the probe into Billion Tree Tsunami project was in process while Malam Jabba resort probe had been concluded in the light of the Peshawar High Court’s directives.

Claims bureau has summoned ‘sacred cows’— something that was impossible in the past

A Supreme Court bench, headed by the then chief justice Saqib Nisar, had in September 2018 stopped NAB from probing alleged corruption in the BRT project. The apex court in February last year had also stopped a Federal Investigation Agency probe into the project.
KP Minister for Labor and Human Rights Shaukat Yousafzai, while explaining the provincial government’s rationale for stopping the probes through stay order said that the project was built through a loan from the Asian Development Bank.
He said that if the provincial government had not taken stay from the apex court, the investigations would definitely have led to the stopping of work on the project.
Besides, Mr Yousafzai said, it would also have led to an increase the amount of the loan.
He said that the provincial government took stay from apex court to complete the project on time. “The BRT is now functioning,” he said.
Mr Yousafzai said that they were not opposed to investigations into the project and NAB and the FIA could investigate into the project after it was complete.
A NAB statement issued here quoted Justice Iqbal saying that NAB had summoned even “sacred cows” which was impossible in the past.
It said that Director General of NAB KP Farooq Naseer Awan briefed Mr Iqbal about the latest status of mega corruption cases.
Mr Awan said that NAB KP since its inception had processed 56,397 complaints, 3,831 complaint verifications, 1,940 inquiries and 765 investigations and filed over 560 references.
He said that presently, 192 corruption references were under trial in different accountability courts of Peshawar.
He said that NAB KP had recovered Rs12.621 billion from corrupt elements since its inception, whereas it had incurred expenditures of Rs3.103bn.
“The bureau has also recovered billions of rupees from fake housing societies and returned the looted money to investors,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, the NAB chairman said that the KP chapter was an important chapter of the accountability body and playing a vital role its overall performance.
He said that business community and bureaucracy were backbone of country’s progress and prosperity.
“Bureaucracy should not be scared of NAB as the bureau has regard for it. NAB is a friendly institution which respects law- abiding officers and departments.”
Mr Iqbal said that separate cells had been established in all offices of NAB, including in KP, to address complaints of business community.
He said that a total of 1,270 corruption references involving Rs1,386 billion were under trial in various accountability courts.
“NAB has decided to file early hearing pleas in the courts for early conclusion of these references,” he said. “NAB adheres to its decision of strictly respecting self-esteem of the suspects.”
Mr Iqbal said that NAB had signed a memorandum of understanding with China to ensure transparency in China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects.
He said that reputed international organisations like Transparency International, World Economic Forum and Global Peace, Canada, had lauded the performance of NAB.

1,"US, Russia seek to avoid nightmare confrontation over Ukraine",American secretary of state says it is “likely the presidents will speak directly in the near future”.,"STOCKHOLM: Momen­tum was building on Thursday for direct talks between US President Joe Biden and Russian leader Vladimir Putin as both sides sought to avoid a “nightmare” confrontation over Ukraine.
The Russian and US foreign ministers came face to face in Sweden to discuss recent allegations raised by Kiev and its Western allies that Russia could invade ex-Soviet Ukraine this winter.
Western powers have been sounding the alarm for weeks about Russia massing troops along the border with Ukraine, further stoking tensions in an area where a long-running conflict has already left 13,000 dead.
Moscow, which seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and backs separatists fighting Kiev, has strongly denied it is plotting an attack and blames Nato for fuelling tensions.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday called for “long-term security guarantees” on his country’s borders to halt Nato’s eastward expansion after meeting US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.
As Lavrov warned that the “nightmare scenario of a military confrontation was returning” in Europe, Blinken said it was “likely the presidents will speak directly in the near future”.
Russia also said that it hopes for “contact” between Putin and Biden in the coming days.
“The date has not yet been agreed. There are difficulties in aligning the calendars of the two leaders, but contact is very necessary, our problems are multiplying,” said Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov.
“There is no movement on bilateral affairs, which are more and more reaching an acute crisis phase. There is no mutual understanding about how to de-escalate the situation in Europe,” he was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.
“The situation in Europe is very alarming,” he added.
“It’s clear that this will be one of the main topics of discussion at the presidential level.”
Attending a meeting in Stockholm of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Lavrov accused Nato of inching its military infrastructure closer to Russia’s borders.
Blinken said the US had “deep concerns about Russia’s plans for renewed aggression against Ukraine,” and warned Moscow of “serious consequences” if Russia “decides to pursue confrontation”.
But the top US diplomat also struck a conciliatory note, saying the US was ready to “facilitate” the “full implementation” of the Minsk peace accords.
The Minsk deal was reached after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and aimed at resolving the conflict with pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine but was never enforced.
“The best way to avert a crisis is through diplomacy,” Blinken said.

2,‘Mini-budget’ with adjustments worth Rs600bn finalised,Bill to be submitted to parliament after approval by the cabinet.,"ISLAMABAD: The government on Thursday finalised a ‘mini-budget’ involving fiscal adjustments and expenditure cuts worth about Rs600 billion as part of an understanding with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cool down the over-heating economy.
The steps will serve to reverse the effects of the federal government’s ‘pro-growth budget’ for Fiscal Year 2022 adopted only five months ago, according to some analysts.
The steps are being described as the “prior actions” that will pave way for submission of Pakistan’s request to the IMF board for approval in the middle of January. The board’s approval will ensure the release of $1bn for the country.
Meanwhile, the government has removed Yusuf Khan from the position of finance secretary and appointed secretary of the Planning Division Hamid Yaqoob Sheikh in his place.

Bill to be submitted to parliament after approval by the cabinet

As part of the adjustments finalised, the government has decided to reduce spending under the Public Sector Development Programme by Rs200bn, with Rs50bn coming from decrease in general government expenditure.
On the other hand, the withdrawal of tax exemptions will earn around Rs350bn for the government.
The IMF actually wanted tax measures worth Rs700bn, including withdrawal of tax exemptions and revision of tax slabs. However, an understanding for the current fiscal year was reached only on withdrawal of tax exemptions of Rs350bn. The exemptions on food items, fertilisers and pesticides will remain.
The IMF had also asked for an increase in tax on provident fund and upward revision in salary slabs for tax. However, this proposal has been set aside for the time being.
A senior official in the finance ministry said a bill would ultimately be submitted to the National Assembly after vetting. It is being vetted in the law division, the official said, adding that it would then be placed before the cabinet for approval.
After the cabinet’s approval the bill would be laid in the parliament.
According to sources, the government has revised upwards the valuation rates in the real estate sector to 90 per cent of the market level for calculation of tax in 40 major cities of the country, including Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar and Islamabad.
The number of cities in the list was increased from 20 to 40 to increase the tax collection from transactions in the real estate sector.
Under the head of customs, the government has decided to consider imposing regulatory duty on import of electric vehicles to lower its import. In the budget the government had lowered duty on electric vehicles to encourage its use in the domestic market.
It has also been proposed that import of complete built unit (CBU) vehicles of all types be restricted by imposing across-the-board regulatory duties.
Similarly, imposition of federal excise duty on vehicles in CKD/SKD conditions is also under consideration, which amounts to more than 80pc of the total imports in the automobile sector. The CKD/SKD imports posted a massive increase in the month of November.
It has also been decided that the facility of corporate guarantees against disputed import duties be reversed. Now it will be replaced with a bank guarantee or pay order.
The PM’s adviser on finance also proposed imposition of regulatory duty on several non-essential and luxury items. At the same time, to discourage import of non-essential items, it has been decided that regulatory duty on 525 items be imposed. These items were already subject to 100pc cash margin, which did not help achieve the desired result of restricting the imports.
Under the cash margin, the importer will deposit 100pc value of import with the bank before processing of the case.
According to an official source, the commerce ministry is opposing the imposition of regulatory duties as well as cash margin on the plea that it will slow down the economy. However, the finance adviser is serious about implementing the decision.
The ministry said that import value is price-driven because of increase in global prices. The situation further deteriorated because of the highest-ever depreciation of the rupee.
The central bank is pushing for a cash margin proposal instead of managing the free float of the exchange rate, which leads to inflation and a high cost of energy in the country.

3,‘Mischievous spin’ given by India to gurdwara incident rejected,FO says Pakistan accords highest primacy to the minorities’ rights,"ISLAMABAD: A senior diplomat of the Indian High Commission was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and conveyed Pakistan’s “categorical rejection of the mischievous spin given by India to an isolated incident” at Gurdwara Darbar Sahib.
In a statement on Thursday, the Foreign Office said: “It was conveyed to the Indian diplomat that the incident was swiftly addressed and clarified.”

The FO said the government of Pakistan accorded “highest primacy to the rights of the minorities”.

FO says Pakistan accords highest primacy to the minorities’ rights

“Sanctity of religious places and revered sites of every community is ensured in Pakistan,” it said.
The FO said the Indian diplomat was instead told to urge the government of India to investigate the incidents of gross and systematic persecution of minorities, which continue with impunity and state complicity.
“Given its systematic marginalisation and brutalisation of minorities, India has no locus standi to even feign concern for minorities elsewhere,” it said.
The FO said Indian authorities must focus on ensuring effective protection of their own minorities and places of worship from repeated instances of desecration, hate crimes and mob lynching.

5,Victory for Meghan as tabloid’s court appeal dismissed,The duchess accuses the newspaper of dragging out the case to sell more copies,"

MEGHAN Markle.—AP

 
LONDON: Meghan Markle, Britain’s Duchess of Sussex, called for an overhaul of tabloid newspapers after she won victory on Thursday in her long-running privacy battle with a British newspaper which had printed a personal letter she wrote to her estranged father.
The Court of Appeal in London threw out an appeal by the Mail on Sunday against an earlier ruling that it infringed Meghan’s privacy and copyright by publishing parts of a letter she penned to her father Thomas Markle, three months after her wedding to Prince Harry, Queen Elizabeth’s grandson.
The letter’s contents “were personal, private and not matters of legitimate public interest”, the court said in a ruling.
“This is a victory not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what’s right,” the duchess said in a statement.

The duchess accuses the newspaper of dragging out the case to sell more copies

She accused the paper of dragging out the case to generate more headlines and sell more papers, saying the “harmful practices” of the industry needed reform.
Associated Newspapers, Mail on Sunday’s publisher, said it was very disappointed with the decision and would consider an appeal to Britain’s Supreme Court.
“It is our strong view that judgement should be given only on the basis of evidence tested at trial, and not on a summary basis in a heavily contested case,” it said.
Meghan wrote the handwritten five-page letter to Markle after a collapse in their relationship in the run-up to her wedding, which her father missed due to ill health and after he admitted posing for paparazzi pictures.
The paper, which published extracts in February 2019, argued Markle wanted the letter public to respond to anonymous comments by Meghan’s friends in interviews with the US magazine People which made reference to it.
A high court judge ruled in February in Meghan’s favour, concluding the paper should print a front-page apology and pay her legal bills.
The paper appealed, arguing Meghan, 40, had written the letter knowing it could become public, a suggestion she rejected.
During three days of hearings at the appeal court last month, the paper’s legal team produced a witness statement from her former communications chief Jason Knauf which they said cast doubt on her account.
Knauf’s statement also showed she and Harry had discussed providing assistance to authors of a biography about the couple, something she had previously denied.
That led to the duchess apologising but said she had not intended to mislead the court.
The Court of Appeal rejected the paper’s arguments and said Meghan’s “unfortunate lapse of memory” did not impact on the outcome.
“It is hard to see what evidence could be adduced at trial that would alter or bear upon the issue,” the three judges said.
The paper’s publisher said the article had corrected “the false briefings” from Meghan’s friends and raised other issues of public interest.
“No evidence has been tested in cross-examination, as it should be, especially when Mr Knauf’s evidence raises issues as to the Duchess’s credibility,” it said.
Meghan and Harry’s relationship with the media soured quickly after their marriage, and they stepped down from official duties last year, citing the intrusion from the press as one of the main reasons for their decision.
Harry said it was destroying his mental health, and that was why the couple had moved to Los Angeles.
Critics of the couple have said they are keen for publicity but only on their own terms, having given an explosive in-depth interview to Oprah Winfrey in March while last month Meghan appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres talk show.
Their refusal to engage with some of Britain’s biggest-selling tabloids has also led to a slew of negative headlines, with papers contrasting Harry as self-serving compared to other dutiful members of his family, such as the queen and his elder brother Prince William.
“What matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create,” Meghan said.
