“Such incidents tarnish the image of the legal fraternity,” said a joint statement issued by LHCBA president Maqsood Buttar, vice president Mudassir Maghiana, secretary Mohsin Abbas and finance secretary Faisal Tauqir Sial. The bar leaders said the incident in the court of Mandi Bahauddin consumer court was highly condemnable. They said respect for the judiciary was the responsibility of all.  
However, they also condemned police for, what they claimed, harassment and arrest of lawyers who had no link to the incident. They said all the institutions were supposed to work within their lawful boundaries.
Police had registered a first information report under multiple criminal charges including terrorism against a group of lawyers for misbehaving and thrashing District and Sessions Judge Rao Abdul Jabbar Khan while he was conducting his court.
Taking notice of the incident, the Punjab Bar Council also suspended the licences of five lawyers including local bar association president Zahid Yar Gondal and secretary Yasir Arafat, for their alleged involvement in manhandling and thrashing of judge Rao Abdul Jabbar.  
The lawyers’ attack was in retaliation to the conviction of Mandi Bahauddin DC Tariq Basra and AC Imtiaz Ali Baig awarded by the sessions judge in a contempt case. However, the Lahore High Court had suspended the conviction.

4,Punjab's farmers fear ‘significant’ drop in wheat yield,Punjab Agriculture Department has decided to offer special prayers for rain at all its offices in the province on Friday.,"LAHORE: Farmers fear a ‘significant’ drop in the wheat output this season because of the ongoing fertiliser crisis coupled with unfavourable weather and high diesel rates.
Wheat sowing begins in Punjab in the first week of November and the Crop Reporting Service says so far 80pc of the 16.7 million acres sowing target fixed for the 2021-22 season has been achieved.
Last year 16.21m acres of land had come under wheat and the acreage has been increased this season on the direction of the federal government’s Wheat Review Committee which met this September and desired that Punjab should produce three million tonnes more grain this year. The province had produced over 20m tonnes of wheat during 2020-21. But farmers fear the target may not be achieved because of multiple factors.
Mian Saqib, a wheat grower from Sahiwal, says prices of diammonium phosphate (DAP), Nitro phosphate and urea fertilisers have shot through the roof. DAP, which is applied while preparing land for sowing wheat, is available in the black market at a rate of up to Rs9,800 against its official price of Rs7,300 per bag. At least one and a half bags of DAP are applied in an acre. Likewise, a bag of urea is being sold at a rate ranging between Rs2,200 and Rs2,500, while its controlled rate is Rs1,760, he adds.

Prayers for rain today

Saddam Bodla, another farmer, says an increase of at least Rs20 per litre in diesel rate is also affecting the crop because tractors for tillage purposes have not been used as extensively as required while the costly fuel will also deter growers from running tubewells for pumping out water for irrigation to overcome the canal water shortage.
The Indus River System Authority (Irsa) has already forecast an average 38pc water shortage for Rabi crops, while weather pundits are also predicting below normal rains in Punjab plains during the Rabi season.
Mr Bodla apprehends around 20pc decline in the wheat output if the government does not act timely to remove the factors likely to hit the yield.
Agriculture authorities in Punjab are, however, pinning their hopes on a mega awareness campaign recently launched by it with the help of 30,000 students from various universities to impart the wheat growers knowledge about new farming techniques and adopting good agricultural practices for a better yield.
SPECIAL PRAYERS: The Punjab Agriculture Department has decided to offer special prayers for rain at all its offices in the province on Friday (today).
A spokesperson for the department says the province is facing 28pc water shortage for Rabi season while there have been no rains for the last many weeks creating a drought-like conditions at a time when main Rabi crops, wheat and gram, are being sown.
He says the dry season is not only creating hurdles in achieving production targets for Rabi crops but also causing smog in the province. To overcome the situation, divine help will be sought by offering special prayers at all divisional and district offices of the department at 11am on Friday, he says.

According to the PML-N, both leaders stressed that democratic forces should gather on one platform for the sake of the people of the country. They also expressed serious concern over unbridled inflation and the worst economic condition in the country.
Shehbaz Sharif said the Imran Khan government had failed to deliver as it had brought the country to the brink of economic disaster. The country’s economic reins had been given to the IMF.
The opposition leader in the National Assembly further said the PTI government was responsible for the ‘crash’ of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). He said this showed where the country was heading economically. The PSX witnessed a massive selling pressure on Thursday as the benchmark KSE-100 index shed more than 2,000 points.
Mustafa Kamal said the people of the country wanted to get rid of this government at the earliest as it had made the lives of the masses miserable through its poor governance.
Meanwhile, PML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz has suspended political activities for two weeks because of her engagements in her son’s (Junaid) walima festivities at Jati Umra.

PML-N MPA Samiullah Khan submitted the resolution in the PA on Thursday. It said this House demanded from the federal government to listen to the grievances of the people of Gwadar who had been protesting for the last many days and address their problems on a priority basis.
The resolution said it was a matter of concern that the protesters included a large number of women and children and they had taken to the street for their just demands. Gwadar played an important role in the progress of the country and ignoring its residents would not be wise on the part of the government, it said and demanded that the federal government must act immediately to improve the law and order situation after redressing the grievances of the protesters.

Besides, fishermen have been deprived of earning their livelihood, a ban imposed on border trade and people are not getting health, education, water supply and other basic amenities. Similarly, they said drug mafia was running drugs and liquor business with the connivance of the local administration due to which the youth were becoming drug addicts and the provincial government was doing nothing to abolish liquor shops and act against the drugs business.

LUMS National Incubation Center Lahore (NICL) in collaboration with the Innovation-Acceleration Lab at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan hosted Solutions Fest 2.0: Reimagining our Relationship with Plastics in Pakistan.  
The event was aimed to discuss, strategise and create solutions to plastic pollution. The festival brought together people at the heart of the design process and curated a community-led problem-solving engagement opportunity to address the issue of plastic waste management in Pakistan.  
During the event, plastic problem solvers explored materials, tested connectivity, worked with tools and mechanics, created structures, and improved on iterations by focusing on and responding to the problem of plastic waste generation and on creating a system for a circular economy.  
Solutions included a mobile app to facilitate door-to-door collection of recyclable plastics; prototypes of interlocking plastic bricks to enable low-cost housing for slums; upcycled, aesthetic furniture; another solution to turn non-recyclable plastics from waste to energy; and eco-friendly, low-cost, specialised shoes made of recycled material for children born with clubfoot.
All prototypes were created at NICL’s state-of-the art, Makers Lab, which includes metal, CNC, PCB, wood, and 3D printing facilities for speedy, high quality hardware solutions.  
UNDP Pakistan Innovation-Acceleration-Lab Head of Experimentation Ehsan Gul stated, “We need to rapidly prototype and experiment to find solutions for fixing the rapidly increasing plastic waste management problem in Pakistan.”  
He said the fest provided an opportunity to bring sustainability enthusiasts, local recyclers, private sector partners, etc. together to catalyse ideation and invention.  
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Pakistan Director General Hammad Naqi Khan said they came across a myriad of good ideas in the fest and few of the ideas were both viable and scalable. He said radical change should be brought in terms of plastic use and small steps for sectors like healthcare plastic usage was imperative but for most other sectors it would boil down to mere convenience where they needed to intervene and bring change.  
He emphasised the importance of taking a collaborative approach, and involving stakeholders across the value chain, from consumers to multinational corporations to the government to create synergies and tangible impact.
