0,Teachers in Islamabad vow to continue protest against local govt ordinance,"""Schools in Islamabad to remain closed until our demands are accepted,"" say protesting teachers.","ISLAMABAD: Thousands of schoolteachers staged a protest demonstration outside Parliament House on Thursday demanding the government withdraw its decision of placing public sector schools under the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI).
The teachers along with non-teaching staff from 390 schools first gathered in front of the National Press Club and then moved towards Parliament House. At D-Chowk, they faced some resistance from the police but the protesters managed to reach Constitution Avenue.
Before ending the protest peacefully, the protesters said schools will remain closed and next week they would hold a sit-in, which will be participated by parents and students as well.
“Next week, we will give a decisive call. Today’s show was just to make the government realise that we will not accept this decision and an amendment has to be made to the Local Government Ordinance 2021,” said Joint Action Committee Chairman Fazal-i-Mola.

Schools in Islamabad to remain closed until demand accepted; students, parents will also join protest sit-in next week, say protesters

Leaders of opposition parties, including former defence minister Khawaja Asif, former federal minister Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, ex-MNA Anjum Aqeel, PPP leader Sibtul Hassan Bukhari, Mian Aslam of Jamaat-i-Islami and others visited the protesters and expressed solidarity with them. They also assured them of their full support.
Holding banners and placards, the protesters raised slogans against the government, demanding the withdrawal of section 166 of Local Government Ordinance 2021 which states that the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) will be devolved to the local government and the mayor will be the reporting officer of the director general FDE.
Senior school Principal Farida Yasmin said it was unfortunate that the government had forced the teaching community to take to the streets.
“We will not accept this ordinance come what may. The local government completed its five-year term without funds, rules, regulations and bylaws. So, now through an ordinance educational institutions are being placed under the local government.”
The local government is supposed to generate its own resources and funds while Islamabad’s education sector require billions of rupees every year, something which is beyond the capacity of the local government, she said, adding in case the decision was not reversed the local government could go for privatisation of schools.
She said government representatives were saying that worldwide schools worked under the local government. But why they are not telling us that in developed countries local government is too strong and even a mayor is regarded more powerful than the legislature. But here in Pakistan, mayors are unable to get their own honorarium and offices for their representatives. 
Islamabad’s mayor was unable to get office spaces for the union council chairmen, she said.
“We are here for our future generation. The government is going to place our schools under the MCI. We are federal government employees and would not work under the corporation,” said a schoolteacher, Shazia Khan.
She said the federal government never cooperated with a mayor of the opposition party so in case the opposition wins the elections what will be the future of the local government and the mayor. In this case, the federal government will leave the local government unattended, she said.
Another teacher said instead of doing experiment with the education sector in the capital, which was running smoothly, the government should focus on controlling inflation and skyrocketing prices.
Federal Government Teachers’ Association President Malik Ameer Khan and Non-Teaching Staff Association President Sardar Sadiq and others said schools will remain closed until the government withdraws its decision.
“Thousands of teachers were on roads but the government representatives did not bother to contact us. This is enough to gauge government’s seriousness towards education,” Mr Khan told Dawn on Thursday night. He, however, said all opposition parties had assured them of their support.
“I would request Prime Minister Imran Khan to look into the issue to know why the teaching community is being forced to take to the streets,” he said.
Meanwhile, senator Irfan Siddiqui chairman on Education took notice of the protest and decided to take up this issue in upcoming meeting of standing committee to be held on December 7.

The sacked employees, however, claimed that the decision was a violation of the Islamabad High Court’s orders which had directed the commission not to take any action against the employees.
A few months ago PMC had made the employees OSDs and sent letters to them that they should accept voluntary golden handshake scheme. They were asked that if they were terminated from the service, their financial package, which had to be given at the time of golden handshake, will be reduced.
Employees received e-mails, instead of registered letters, informing that Under Section 8 (2) (a) of the PMC Act 2020 and pursuant to the terms of the compulsory golden handshake scheme duly approved by the government on Sept 15, the PMC has approved their severance from the employment.
The letters, available with Dawn, stated “the severance packages shall be the full and final settlement of any or all dues and claims that may exist prior to April 14, 2021 and shall include and represents ex-gratia payment for period served and period unserved up to the age of retirement, gratuity payments due under your current contract, refund of amounts deposited on account of any defunct schemes with the erstwhile PMDC and adjustment of any other due benefits or deduction of outstanding loans, etc.”
Employees have been informed that they will get around Rs2 million or in some cases a little over Rs3 million and are advised to contact Finance Division, in case of query within seven days.
An employee, who has received the letter, requesting not to be quoted, said:“We are at the mid of our carrier so now we will not be able to get permanent jobs. It is unfortunate that no one has bothered to think about us and future of our children.”
“Employees were part of a constitutional petition seeking justice against pseudo health reforms, where PMDC was dissolved after an Act of Parliament despite rejection from opposition parties. The PMC Act 2020 discontinued the representation of the provinces including one slot reserved for the Supreme Court judge,” he said.
The PMC spokesperson was contacted to get version but it did not respond till filing of this story.

On the direction of the Public Accounts Committee, PARC had regularised the services of the employees on August 25, 2021.
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah issued the direction while hearing a petition filed against the regularisation of the employees.
Barrister Umer Ijaz Gillani, the counsel for the petitioners, pointed out that the PARC management had issued notifications for regularisation of these employees stating that they were being regularised under the direction of the PAC.
Justice Minallah observed that neither the PAC nor any parliamentary committee could exercise executive powers.
The counsel for the employees requested the court to refer the matter to the PARC board.
The court declined the request as the chief justice remarked that he will examine the matter in accordance with the law.
In August, the PAC subcommittee had expressed anger over PARC’s chairman for not abiding by its orders and warned him of initiation of contempt proceedings.

4,NA body’s report points out ‘massive’ maladministration at IIUI,The report highlights that several appointments at the university were made in violation of rules.,"ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary panel in its report has made startling revelations about alleged maladministration in the affairs of International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI).
A subcommittee of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Education, headed by MNA Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, through the report with documentary evidence revealed the alleged violations.
The report proposed that action should be taken to bring improvement in IIUI, which is one of the largest public sector universities with around 30,000 students. It stated that there was sufficient evidence to establish that several appointments on the posts of deans and head of departments have been made by violating provisions of the IIUI Ordinance and statutes.
“This includes appointment till further orders without specifying tenures. It is creating an environment of ad hocism and vulnerability in the university which eventually erodes the academic freedom; a hallmark of any academic institution,” read the inquiry report. Several office orders issued by IIUI regarding appointments have also been mentioned in it.

Says several appointments made in violation of rules

The report stated that the university administration should be given 15 days to rectify all notifications which were issued in violation of the IIUI ordinance. 
“A perusal of the record shows that there is a complete lack of transparent mechanism of the appointment of vice presidents (VPs) in IIUI. Currently, these appointments are made in selective and whimsical manner,” it stated, adding these appointments were made in violation of orders of the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
It suggested that the board of governors of IIUI should be directed to finalise the procedure of appointments of VPs in a transparent manner.
The report said: “The practice of appointment of handpicked and blue eyed persons should be immediately stopped by removing the incumbent VPs. In addition, no teaching faculty should be appointed on position of VP (AF&P) because it creates conflict of interest ... a large number of ad hoc and contractual employees have been appointed without any competitive process. The selective application of the policy (contractual pay system) is not only discriminatory but it also involves the exercise of colourful discretion by the university authority”.
It added that this policy should be replaced with a transparent recruitment policy.
While discussing the payment received by IIUI Rector Dr Masoom Yasinzai, the report states: “Evidence also shows that the Rector IIUI has been receiving sizeable payments from Imam Muhammad Bin Saud University Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. No plausible justification or explanation has been provided to justify the payment of the sum received by the Rector. These periodic payments cannot be presumed to be consultancy fee as the quantum and regularity of the payments clearly show that it was a salary arrangement. Hence, receiving of dual salary is an established case of misrepresentation and financial misconduct”.
It has been recommended that this matter should be referred to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for investigation and punitive action. It states that fixation of the salary of the same rector for his second tenure was done by the board of governors without any authorisation of competent authority (the chancellor). The rector has also been accused of getting illegal house rent.
Regarding a scandal about the university’s VP which alleges his involvement in making inappropriate videos, the report states that there is nothing on the record to show that proper inquiry has been authorised and conducted.
“University’s lukewarm action and half hearted attempt to probe this matter through junior level committee comprising of subordinates of VP is clear indication of the cover up.
“This VP should immediately be removed from his administrative position of VP, IIUI and a high powered and impartial committee should be constituted to investigate this matter,” it stated, adding that officials from FIA, Intelligence Bureau, Higher Education Commission (HEC) and Ministry of Education should be made part of the inquiry committee.
It added: “The crux of findings is that there is severe management/administration/academic mess in the university. There is continuous infighting between the two top offices of Rector and President IIUI. There are so many lacunas in the IIUI Ordinance 1985 and it requires overhauling and needs to be brought at par with other federal universities”.
IIUI spokesperson Nasir Farid said he had no idea of this inquiry report, adding the IIUI administration was performing its duties in accordance with rules and regulations.
Talking about the rector’s dual salary, he said the rector did not get double salary rather it was a consultancy fee. Whereas appointments of deans are legitimate, he added.

5,Steps being taken to quell smog: PM’s aide,TAXILA: Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam on Sunday said tackling pollutant...,"TAXILA: Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam on Sunday said tackling pollutant sources was the most effective way to quell the growing challenge of smog that causes serious health and environmental hazards during winter months.
Talking to newsmen in Hassanabdal, he said burning of rice crop residue, dirty fuel sources in traditional brick kilns, solid waste, existing aging urban transport system and factories were the typical causative factors behind smog.
He said it was time to change our transport culture as 40 per cent of the smog was caused due to smoke emitted from vehicles and that was why the government was shifting fuel from Euro-II to Euro-V.
He said the serious issue of smog will continue to affect public health besides afflicting the environment and economic sectors as long as these very sources of smog remained unaddressed. 
“We are also taking action against smoke-emitting vehicles,” he said and added that the use of electric vehicles would also help in lessening pollution. He said the much-needed technology had been finally launched and was being provided to the farmers which would help avoid burning of the paddy crop residue and instead convert the residue into organic fertiliser for boosting fertility of their farmlands. He stressed the need for changing the decades-old techniques of the farmers, especially in the paddy crop cultivation areas, as the use of the technology would help avoid burning of the paddy crop residue and convert the waste into organic fertiliser.
He said technology was being introduced across the country under the government’s national project ‘Mechanised Management of Rice Crop Residue’ and hundreds of pairs of rice straw shredder and happy seeder technology were being provided to the farmers under a joint multibillion rupees initiative launched by the Agricultural Engineering Division (Lahore) and the Federal Ministry of Climate Change.
He said Rs30 billion were being spent on the disbursement of 50,000 units of rice straw shredder and happy seeder technology to the farmers.
Responding to a question, he said that artificial rain could be carried out next year to minimise the effect of smog in Punjab, especially in Lahore.
Referring to the government’s accord with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Mr Aslam said two moves of the government to get rid of the clutches of the donor organisation had failed, leaving the government with no other option.
Responding to another question, he refuted MNA Riaz Fatyana’s statement about his quarrel with Minister of State for Climate Change Zartaj Gul at COP26 meeting held in Glasgow. He said the party had served a show-cause notice on the MNA for this.

Mr Siddique said on Nov 3 he approached the district and sessions court seeking directions to the police for registration of the case.
On Nov 25, the court ordered the police to register the case, he added.
According to the FIR, an autopsy was conducted on the body on October 20 and the report was obtained on October 21. The doctor in the report said the “probable cause of death was strangulation due to hanging.” However, the forensic report was still awaited, it added.
When contacted, Station House Officer (SHO) Koral Sub-inspector Fazal Khaliq told Dawn that some doubts over the incident delayed registration of the case. The police are still waiting for the autopsy report and the court had been informed about it, he added.
However, the case has been registered in response to the court order, the SHO said.

“New approval should not be given for construction of schools, colleges and hospitals on the main road. All schools and hospitals must have four road-cross assistants,” he said and directed the deputy commissioners of four districts of Rawalpindi Division including Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal and Jhelum to make sure that assistant commissioners of the division become a part of traffic awareness in their respective districts. 
Schools located in rented buildings should change their location immediately, change orders should be issued and the condition of an assistant on the road will also apply to hospitals, he said.

14,Pakistan reaffirms commitment to end HIV/Aids by 2030,"Health ministry coordinating closely with all provinces to halt spread, SAPM says...","ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) Dr Faisal Sultan on Thursday said the government has devised national and provincial strategies to end HIV/Aids by 2030.
While attending an event in connection with World Aids Day, he said a plan of action has been set for 2021-25 to create an enabling environment with multi-sectoral engagement to address legislative, socio-cultural-economic, religious, political, legal and financial determinants that can influence HIV awareness, education, prevention, care, treatment and support initiatives.
The theme for this year’s World Aids Day was ‘End Inequalities. End Aids. End Pandemics.’ The Aids epidemic in the Asia Pacific is rising and becoming all the more challenging in Pakistan. There has been a significant rise of people with HIV living in Pakistan, with 84 percent of these new infections being reported between 2010-2021.
Influential diplomats, representatives of United Nations Country Team (UNCT); Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids (UNAIDS); Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM); health, population, nutrition and health development partners; Association of People Living with Aids (APLHIV) and other community-based organisations working on HIV attended the event.

Health ministry coordinating closely with all provinces to halt spread, SAPM says

Mr Sultan said that the health ministry has been working closely with provinces to take steps to work with communities to halt the spread of new infections.
“With support from GFATM, we are providing free of cost HIV diagnostic, treatment, care and support services to people living with HIV through dedicated HIV treatment centres. Even multi-month dispensation has been ensured during lockdowns through door-to-door service provision,” he said.
Dr Sultan concluded his speech by pledging to lead efforts towards increased government spending to cover all aspects of the national HIV response specially along the HIV prevention and treatment cascade, by mobilising domestic resources and integration of HIV services into the health system.
It is worth mentioning that as the world’s attention is focused on the Covid-19 global pandemic, there is a danger that the ongoing HIV and Aids pandemic will be forgotten.
Speaking at the event Ms Yuki Takemoto, UNAIDS country director for Pakistan and Afghanistan said that HIV/Aids still threatens the world including Pakistan.
Sharing his opinion, UN Resident Coordinator Julien Harneis said for course corrections, people need to end Aids as it will also protect Pakistan against future pandemics.
National coordinator of APLHIV Asghar Satti stressed upon constant HIV testing for ensuring that all people living with HIV can lead a healthy and productive life.
Furthermore, another event was held at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in collaboration with APLHIV.
Parliamentary Secretary for Health Dr Nausheen Hamid expressed concern over the rising rate of HIV in Pakistan and advocated for better preventive measures to discourage quackery which is one of the leading causes of HIV in Pakistan.
Deputy national coordinator, National Aids Control Programme Prof Ayesha Isani Majeed said steps are being taken to control Aids in Pakistan.
“We have done comprehensive testing at Central Jail Rawalpindi and camps in Islamabad Capital Territory at Meharabadi and Bari Imam to identify positive cases and give awareness to them not to become a source of spread,” she said.
Pims Director Dr Ejaz Qadeer said communicable diseases should be tackled by the government at the primary health care level.

18,Economy on ventilator: Sherry,Says last three years of government disastrous...,"ISLAMABAD: Voicing concern over the rising tide of inflation and regressive taxation, members of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) on Thursday alleged that the government has wilfully put the economy on a ventilator.
Senator Sherry Rehman said the last three years of this government have been disastrous as the whirlwind of economic policies that have been implemented have resulted in a perfect storm of multiple economic disasters.
“All economic factors point towards a failure in governance, be it the $5.107 billion trade deficit or the falling PKR which is now at 176.65 and is putting immense pressure on the current account deficit. The dangerous double-digit inflation rate now stands at a whopping 11.5 percent, haunting the public that is already exhausted from unemployment and poverty. Whether it is the record-breaking debt, extortionate petrol prices, perilous trade deficit or the plunging value of the PKR; our economy is on a ventilator”, she said while talking to reporters.
Pakistanis have been forced to choose between gas for heat during the winter, education for their children, food on their plates or petrol for motorcycles.

Says last three years of government disastrous

She pointed out that the inflation rate has surged to a shocking 11.5pc from 9.2pc, adding, food inflation was at an abysmal 11.2pc compared to 10.8pc last month. 
She regretted that in one year alone, the price of flour has increased by 26.58pc, oil by 45.85pc and petrol by 44.4pc, with all other commodity prices following suit. “Despite this, the government is hell-bent on announcing a mini-budget as per blind instructions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). What the country needs is to get rid of this incompetent government, not dictation from the IMF”, she added.
The government conveniently shifts the blame onto the opposition without addressing the obvious cracks in its system of governance, which came as a result of the government’s own inability to enact stabilising economic policies. 
Talking about the massive trade deficit, the senator said it was creating an enormous domino effect, exposing fault lines in Pakistan’s macroeconomic policies. “For the fifth consecutive month, Pakistan’s trade deficit has reached an all-time high at $5.107 billion in November, against $1.946b last year - a whopping 162.4pc increase due to the severe imbalance in the imports and exports. A painful further devaluation in the PKR is now inevitable. 
“Why is the ‘data on imports’ still being analysed by the Ministry of Commerce? The PTI government is spreading a false narrative by mentioning the historic rise in exports and further rubbing salt on the public’s wounds as they continue to conceal the increase in imports by over 94pc and its devastating impact on the trade deficit and the already plummeting PKR. For the July-November period, the trade deficit rose to $20.7bn, in the same period last year the trade deficit stood at $9.5bn. On average, the trade deficit grew by $4.15bn per month. 
“At this rate, by the end of FY22, the trade deficit will be at $50bn. It is shocking that the PTI government has been importing agricultural products for a country known for its thriving agrarian sector.
“To further exacerbate the situation, the government plans to add an additional Rs4 to the petroleum levy every month and already decided on an increase in electricity tariff of Rs4.7 per unit. It is shocking that the domestic oil price has not changed since Nov 5, when it was increased by over Rs8 to Rs145.8 per litre, at the time brent oil price was $82.47/bbl but now there has been a drastic decrease in brent oil which stands at $70.01/bbl. 
The government had a duty to provide much-needed relief to the people of the country and the ability to reasonably lower petrol prices by Rs5 to 8 – yet no action was taken, Ms Rehman said, adding there is an urgent need for Pakistan to revamp economic policies as the tenure of the government has led to an economy in freefall and endless adversities for the Pakistani people.
