0,Panic gives way to carnage at stock market,"KSE-100 index sheds over 2,134 points, highest in a single day since March 2020.","KARACHI: Share prices sank like a stone on Thursday as the latest economic data showed a worsening trade deficit with an indication that interest rates may go up sharply in the immediate term.
The KSE-100 index lost 2,134.99 points or 4.71 per cent to close at 43,234.15 points. The benchmark lost the highest number of points in a day since March 2020 when the Covid-related restrictions kicked in. The single-day decline in share prices constituted the fourth largest fall ever in terms of index points, according to Ismail Iqbal Securities Ltd. The trade deficit for November amounted to $5.1 billion, the highest-ever in the country’s history. In addition, investors expected an interest rate increase in the next monetary policy as the cut-off yields of treasury bills recorded a major jump in the latest auction.
The expectation of a higher inflation number next month on the back of the low-base effect, coupled with currency depreciation, further eroded investors’ sentiments, according to Arif Habib Ltd.
Market participation increased by 60.4pc to 386.8 million shares as investors rushed to dump their holdings. The value of traded shares jumped 52.4pc to $79.7m.

Speaking to Dawn, Next Capital CEO Najam Ali said volatility in the stock market would continue until the return of stability to the foreign exchange market. “The [stock] market can predict an interest rate hike and build it into earnings. The real problem is the perception that the government is unable to control inflation and curb imports. That’s creating nervousness,” he added.
But Mohammed Sohail of Topline Securities asserted that nobody anticipated that the yields on treasury bills would jump close to 12pc so quickly. “[The latest auction] sent a signal that interest rates would not just increase, but increase rather sharply. That’s why investors sold their positions aggressively, which created a panic-like situation,” he told Dawn, noting that the stock market will remain under pressure and “take a long time” to recover from the sudden jolt.
The only stock that contributed positively to the KSE-100 index was First Habib Modaraba, although its weight in the benchmark index is just 0.09pc. Its share price increased by Rs0.07 or 0.77pc to Rs9.22.
Six index constituents that registered no change in their share prices were Ibrahim Fibres Limited, EFU General Insurance Limited, Feroze1888 Mills Limited, Murree Brewery Company Limited, Pakistan Services Limited and Shakarganj Limited.
The rest of 93 companies that contribute to the performance of the KSE-100 index posted share price declines ranging from 0.2pc to 9.98pc on a day-on-day basis. Sectors taking away the highest number of points from the benchmark index included commercial banking (360.42 points), cement (314.2 points), oil and gas exploration (240.12 points), technology and communication (211.75 points) and fertiliser (203.7 points).
Shares that contributed most negatively to the benchmark included Lucky Cement Limited, which took away 149.77 points from the KSE-100 index, followed by Systems Limited (118.9 points), Hub Power Company Limited (101.45 points), Habib Bank Limited (91.39 points) and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (76.94 points).
Stocks recording the biggest declines in percentage terms included Yousaf Weaving Limited, which went down 9.98pc, followed by Byco Petroleum Pakistan Limited (9.3pc), Pakistan International Bulk Terminal Limited (8.11pc), International Industries Limited (7.5pc) and Attock Refinery Limited (7.5pc).
Stocks that contributed significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Limited (33.02m shares), Dolmen City REIT (29.58m shares), Byco Petroleum Limited (22.82m shares), Unity Foods Limited (17.73m shares) and G3 Technologies Limited (17.58m shares).
Foreign investors remained net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.74m on a net basis.

1,"Centre urges Sindh, Balochistan to join ration, health schemes","Decides to hold LG elections in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through EVMs.","ISLAMABAD: The Centre on Thursday urged Sindh and Balochistan to join the federal government’s much ambitious social welfare programmes — Ehsaas Ration and Sehat Card — and decided to hold local government (LG) elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa through electronic voting machines (EVMs).
The decisions were taken at a meeting of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) core committee presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan.
At a press conference after the meeting, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the Balochistan government had agreed to join and contribute to the social welfare programmes, but Sindh had not yet agreed.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Poverty Alleviation and Social Welfare Dr Sania Nishtar briefed the core committee on various social welfare programmes.

Decides to hold LG elections in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through EVMs

Fawad Chaudhry said the government was persuading the Sindh government to join the federal government for starting such welfare programmes in the province, but they were reluctant due to the “absence of chances of receiving personal gains from the programme”. “The Sindh government is anti-people as they are reluctant to join social welfare programmes of the federal government,” he added.
On the other hand, Sindh Information Minister Saeed Ghani told Dawn that the provincial government would never join the Ehsaas Ration Programme under which both the federal and provincial governments will have to contribute Rs350 and Rs650, respectively, as subsidy on three essential items — wheat flour, pulses and edible oil/ghee.
“If the federal government wants to give some relief to the poor, it should increase monthly stipend under the Ehsaas Programme from Rs2,000 to Rs3,000 instead of opting for a complicated process of availing Rs1,000 subsidy per month on three food items,” he added.
Mr Ghani said that under the Ehsaas Ration Programme, the Sindh government had to bear Rs17 billion on account of subsidy. “We [Sindh government] do not have such additional money to contribute to the programme,” he added.
Sinia Nishtar had told Dawn that if the Sindh government did not join the programme, the eligible people of the province would get only Rs350 subsidy, and not Rs1,000 per month.
LG polls through EVMs
At the press conference, Fawad Chaudhry said the Punjab Local Government Bill would be approved over the next few days, adding that LG elections in Punjab and KP would be held through EVMs.
He said local government elections were being held in 17 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on December 19 in which 37,752 candidates were taking part, with 689 candidates in the run for the slots of village chairmen and tehsil mayors and 19,282 for neighborhood councils.
Brushing aside the reports suggesting that the upcoming elections would be costly, the minister claimed that the process of elections would be a bit cheaper than to the past due to use of EVMs.
The PTI’s core committee also discussed the issue of inflation and noted that the Sensitive Price Index had posted a decrease of 0.67 per cent.
Fawad Chaudhry claimed that people would get relief in the days to come. Responding to a question, he said inflation was a result of devastating policies of the previous governments and now people like former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi were shedding crocodile tears on the price hike. He invited Mr Abbasi to have a session with the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics to understand their system of issuing figures about inflation.
The information minister termed the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) a “story of five rats” and said four rats had left the opposition alliance. “It sounds awkward to call Maulana Fazlur Rehman [PDM chief] a rat,” the minister said in an informal way while replying to a person standing behind him.
PM’s special assistant Shahbaz Gill claimed that a new video tape of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz vice president Maryam Nawaz would soon come to the fore which, he said, “will add in humiliation of the party”.
Fawad Chaudhry said former PM Khaqan Abbasi had left Rs157 billion debt, adding that “Pakistan is still bearing the brunt of their anti-people policies”.
He said the opposition was not ready to participate in the meetings of parliamentary parties [for election reforms]. “It is obvious that the opposition is not going to end their reservations over the use of EVMs in the elections,” he added.
Meetings
Presiding over a meeting on Ehsaas Ration Programme, Prime Minister Imran Khan emphasised the need for involving district government authorities to raise awareness among Karyana (grocery shops) stores and the potential beneficiaries about the programme. “The government is taking all possible measures to provide maximum relief to the common man,” he said.
The prime minister was informed that under the ration programme, a monthly subsidy of Rs1,000 on flour, ghee and pulses would be given to 20 million households of the country that have monthly income below Rs50,000.
The programme will be launched across the country on December 15. Registration of Karyana stores under the programme is in progress and more than 15,000 such stores have been registered so far.
Meanwhile, during a meeting with Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, Prime Minister Khan directed the formulation of an effective media communication strategy to highlight various government initiatives for the welfare of the people.
Special Assistant to the Punjab Chief Minister on Information Hassan Khawar and Special Assistant to the KP Chief Minister on Information Barrister Saif Ali also attended the meeting.
According to a source, the prime minister directed them to highlight alleged corruption of the opposition leaders in the media.

2,Vawda given last chance to explain dual nationality,ISLAMABAD: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday gave the last chance to Senator Faisal Vawda to...,"ISLAMABAD: The Elec­tion Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday gave the last chance to Senator Faisal Vawda to explain the concealment of his foreign nationality.
A three-member bench of the commission headed by Chief Election Commis­sioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, while hearing a petition seeking disqualification of the ruling party senator over failure to disclose his foreign nationality at the time of submission of his nomination papers for the 2018 general elections, gave Mr Vawda the last chance and adjourned hearing till Dec 23.
Mr Vawda’s counsel could not attend the hearing due to a family member’s illness.
“If no one attends the next hearing, we will reserve judgement,” the CEC warned, saying the commission had to conclude pending cases and begin preparations for the next elections.
The CEC gave Senator Vawda the option to either submit his arguments to the commission in writing, in which case the bench would reserve its ruling, or present the arguments himself so the bench could issue a verdict.
During the hearing, he noted that it had been established that Mr Vawda possessed a dual citizenship and if he had renounced his foreign nationality, he should submit a renunciation certificate.
Senator Vawda contended that he possessed dual citizenship from birth. At this, the CEC pointed out the issue was whether he possessed a dual citizenship at the time of filing his nomination papers for contesting the 2018 elections.
Mr Vawda said he had already surrendered his American passport, but in the same breath feigned ignorance about the law regarding renunciation of the nationality of any country. He maintained he was not aware of the requirement to submit a renunciation certificate as well, saying he would try to obtain one now.
Regarding the submission of a copy of his alleged renunciation certificate by the petitioner at a previous hearing, Mr Vawda said: “Seven such certificates are circulating on social media. Which one of these should I consider to be the right one? I don’t know how the petitioner got the certificate.”
He sought more time to submit his reply and pleaded to the bench to dispose of the case.
During the hearing, the ECP Sindh member also rebuked the assistant counsel representing Mr Vawda over his failure to submit a relevant file. “They have decided not to let the case proceed,” he said.
The CEC noted that the Islamabad High Court, where the plea for Vawda’s dismissal was originally filed, had directed the ECP to conclude the case within two months. “We have to start preparing for the next general elections as well and will not let the proceedings be delayed anymore,” he stressed.
During the last hearing on Nov 11, the bench had set Dec 2 as the date for final arguments.
The petition, filed in 2020, challenged Mr Vawda’s election as a member of the National Assembly in 2018, claiming he was a US citizen at the time of filing his nomination papers.
The petition said since Mr Vawda had furnished an affidavit to the ECP claiming he was not a national of any other country at the time of contesting the elections, he had made a false statement on oath, hence he must be disqualified under Article 62(1)(f) of the Constitution.
Vawda had resigned from his NA seat hours before he was elected as a senator in March this year.

3,President Alvi allays opposition fears about EVMs,"Says after their success in the upcoming elections, the EVMs will be marketed as a “product of Pakistan”.","ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Thursday attempted to mitigate fears of the opposition parties regarding potential misuse of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and rigging in the next general elections in 2023.
“Do not be afraid of a simple electronic voting machine that will help hold a fair election and bring an end to rigging. People will have to trust it. It is not very technical and is very convenient. A country progresses by adopting new things,” the president said while addressing a ceremony to sign the Election (Amendment) Bill 2021.
Passed by parliament, the bill provides for holding of the next general elections through the EVMs as well as granting the right of vote to overseas Pakistanis through I-voting.
President Alvi said the EVMs would ensure holding of a fair election, which had long been desired in Pakis­tan, as every election was followed by controversies and claims of rigging that also impacted the credibility of respective governments.
He said after their success in the upcoming elections, the EVMs would be marketed as a “product of Pakistan”.
Calling it a “great step”, the president said the legislation was made possible by the consistency of Prime Minister Imran Khan and hard work of his cabinet members despite massive resistance. The EVMs would enable taking a print-out of a vote on the spot instead of printing ballot papers and the technology will also end printing of extra ballots, he explained.
He claimed that people will easily understand the method to cast their vote through EVMs. “The voters will cast votes by touching the screen instead of stamping a ballot paper. The process is the same. What is the resistance for?” he questioned.
To achieve accurate results, Dr Alvi said, the votes would be counted through an in-built calculator though there was an option for manual counting also for the sceptics. He clarified the Ministry of Science and Technology did not manufacture the EVMs itself, but rather created a prototype for an experiment. The Election Commission of Pakistan would select the right EVM based on the required specifications, he stated.
Talking about I-voting for overseas Pakistanis, the president, while brushing aside the possibilities of hacking, quoted the 2018 data of digital transactions worth $5 trillion a day and said the chances of hacking were far lesser than a plane crashing. Due to multiple complications, in-person voting for the expatriates was not possible, he explained.
The president also said the countries that had rejected the EVMs already had better systems in place. On the contrary, Pakistan needed this technology owing to its system’s weakness. He added that EVMs would help eliminate the confusion caused by post-election rigging charges and bring about a strong government to support democracy.
“Don’t worry, the nation will be convinced [about the use of EVMs]. Following this, the country will make progress in other fields too,” the president remarked.
Earlier, Minister for Science and Technology Shibli Faraz called the legislation a historic achievement, saying in the past, controversies around the fairness of elections begot political and economic instability besides confrontation in parliament.
He said following a 90-day deadline issued by the prime minister, the ministry got a prototype of an EVM manufactured through the National University of Sciences and Technology and experimented with it on multiple forums such as universities, chambers, and before the media.
The senator said it was now up to the ECP to choose the EVM based on polling requirements, though the commission had already formed three committees on the matter that would monitor the floating of an international tender.
Adviser to the PM on Parliamentary Affairs Dr Babar Awan said the previous governments’ claims of holding free and fair elections were confined to slogans. The incumbent government was also trying to incorporate the use of EVMs in local government election laws of Islamabad as well as Punjab.
He said the EVMs were meant to minimise human involvement in elections that would also do away with the possibility of double stamping and rejection of votes. Asking the opposition not to be afraid of the technology, Mr Awan said the resistance to EVMs on the pretext of technology was irrational as over 186 million people were already using mobile phones in the country as well as social media.

4,PML-N chides govt over galloping inflation,PPP asks why petrol being sold at costliest rates though global prices are falling.,"ISLAMABAD: Lambasting the government over its economic policies, senior vice president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has said that Pakistan is at number three in the list of countries with highest price hike.
Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, Mr Abbasi, without mentioning his source of information, claimed that in the list of 200 countries with highest inflation, Pakistan was trailing at number three behind Argentine and Turkey.
The former prime minister said if the government continued with the same policies, Pakistan would soon acquire number one position on the list.
He ridiculed the government’s logic that price hike was a worldwide phenomenon. He claimed that Pakistan had the highest inflation in the region as there was no such price hike in neighbouring India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and even Afghanistan.

PPP asks why petrol being sold at costliest rates though global prices are falling

Mr Abbasi said that the country’s import bill had touched the record mark of $8.1 billion for the first time. In June, the import bill was $6.3bn. He claimed that the highest import bill during the PML-N’s government was $5.1bn. However, he said at that time the country was making progress and the government resolved the problem of electricity and gas.
The PML-N leader said today no minister or head of any institution could face the public. He asked the government to make a public confession that it had failed in addressing economic issues of the country.
He was of the view that fresh and fair elections were the only solution to the present crises.
He predicted that soon Adviser to the PM on Finance Shaukat Tarin would be ousted like his predecessor Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, who was sacked by the government over his failure to check price hike only days after his defeat in the Senate elections. Mr Abbasi said it was yet to be seen if Mr Tarin faced the same fate after coming into the Senate or before it.
He also criticised State Bank of Pakistan governor, saying he would also have to face accountability.
Mr Abbasi also lamented the government’s decision of not decreasing the prices of petroleum products despite reduction in the world prices. Instead of providing relief to the masses, he said, the government had increased Rs4 levy on petrol.
Earlier, PML-N president and Leader of Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif in a statement said the PTI government’s economic policy and disastrous steps had crashed the Pakistan Stock Exchange. He warned if the country was not saved from this “corrupt, incapable and incompetent” government immediately, it would be too late to save Pakistan and they would all be crying over spilt milk.
Similarly, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) information secretary and MNA Shazia Marri in her statement questioned as to “why Imran Khan’s incompetent government is selling petrol at highest rates to people of the country while global oil prices are being dropped?”
Ms Marri said Prime Minister Imran Khan should be ready to face the people of Pakistan who would be on roads and streets against the government over the rising prices of petroleum products on December 10.
Ms Marri said that neighbouring India had reduced the petrol prices and was also reducing government taxes, but the PTI government was not providing any relief to the people.
“It is the injustice and height of oppression that Imran Khan’s government is receiving up to Rs27 from the people on per liter on account of petroleum levy,” she added.
The PPP MNA said it was a fraud with the people of Pakistan that the lowest per capita income country like Pakistan was being compared with the most prosperous countries in the prices of petroleum products.
