0,ECP urged to decide PTI funding case without delay,"“The case related to the funding of the PTI from banned sources is a tale of historic fraud,"" says PPP leader Shazia Marri.","ISLAMABAD: The opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has asked the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to decide the seven-year-old foreign funding case of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) without any further delay when it has all the related evidence.
“The case related to the funding of the PTI from the banned sources is a tale of historic fraud,” said PPP information secretary and member of the National Assembly Shazia Marri on Saturday.
She said the ECP possessed all the proofs and, therefore, it should decide the case as early as possible, according to a statement issued by the PPP media office. 
Ms Marri alleged that the PTI government was making every effort to block the announcement of the ECP verdict in the foreign funding case. She alleged Prime Minister Imran Khan had collected funds for his cancer hospital through cheques in the name of the PTI from foreign banned sources.

PPP leader calls the funding from banned sources ‘a tale of historic fraud’

The PPP leader said the prime minister who raised the slogan of accountability wanted to evade his own accountability.
One of the founding members of the PTI and a party dissident, Akbar S. Babar, had filed the foreign funding case against the PTI leadership, including its chairman Imran Khan and the then secretary general Dr Arif Alvi, in November 2014.
In his petition before the ECP, Mr Babar who was once known as a close confidant of Mr Khan had alleged that the PTI leaders were involved in illegal funds collection, corruption, money laundering, and misappropriation of party funds under the political party’s funding laws.
For over a year, case proceedings remained pending before the ECP, because the PTI filed a writ petition in October 2015 before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in an attempt to restrain the ECP scrutiny of its accounts. In February 2017, the IHC remanded the case back to the ECP for a fresh review of its jurisdiction.
Later, the PTI in a tit-for-tat move also filed similar cases against the PPP and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and asked the ECP to scrutinise the accounts of all the registered political parties on the same terms of reference which were being followed in the PTI foreign funding case.
After the last hearing of the case on Oct 11, Minister of State for Information Farrukh Habib, who is a petitioner in the cases against the opposition parties, claimed that the ECP had allowed the PTI to peruse documents related to foreign funding cases against the PML-N and the PPP.
The minister alleged that the PML-N had concealed seven accounts while the PPP had hidden 12 accounts from the ECP.
Next day, however, PPP’s finance secretary Senator Saleem Mandviwala not only refuted the minister’s claim but also asked the ECP to take notice of the “false and incorrect statement” made by the state minister.
Mr Mandviwala termed the minister’s statement an attempt to influence outcome of the foreign funding case being heard by the ECP against the country’s three major political parties.

2,Pemra issues show-cause notice to Channel 24,Media regulator says remarks made during the 'Najam Sethi Show' were aired without any editorial control.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) has issued a show-cause notice to Channel 24 for allegedly airing hate speech, inciting violence and being offensive to commonly accepted standards of decency in the programme ‘Najam Sethi Show’.  
The show-cause notice has been issued to the Central Media Network (Pvt.) Ltd — the parent company of Value TV and Channel 24 — for airing the programme on Nov 24. 
Responding to the show-cause notice, senior journalist Najam Sethi tweeted the clip of the programme, explaining the debate within the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), and said the alliance was directionless and if at all it felt that the common man was devastated by the incumbent government, the opposition must protest aggressively.

 



 

Host of Najam Sethi Show accused of inciting violence

Mr Sethi uploaded another clip of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan setting fire to his electricity bill as part of his civil disobedience campaign against the PML-N government, and commented, “but that has been reported on mainstream media without any action from Pemra”. 

 



 
He also tweeted a video clip of the current interior minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, delivering a fiery speech from the same stage. The show-cause notice said the host of Najam Sethi Show, while commenting on a call related to the PDM’s long march, passed highly objectionable remarks which were tantamount to inciting violence. 

 



 
The electronic media regulator said the remarks were aired without any editorial control. The notice contains a list of violations made by the channel as a result of the remarks by Mr Sethi which includes violation of Section 20(e)&(f) of Pemra Ordinance, 2002 as amended by Pemra (Amendment) Act 2007, Rule 15(1) of Pemra Rules 2009, Regulation 18(1)(c), (g) of Pemra (Television Broadcast Station Operations) Regulations 2012 and Clauses 4 (7) (a) (b) (c), 4(10), 5, 17 & 24 of Electronic Media (Programmes and Adv­er­t­isements) Code of Conduct, 2015 read with Section 27 of Pemra Ordinance, 2002 as amended by Pemra (Amendment) Act 2007. The violations have also been explained in the show-cause notice.
