0,"Code of conduct ‘violation’: ECP serves notices on Aslam Gill, Pervaiz Ashraf",The NA-133 by-election is scheduled to be held on Dec 5.,"LAHORE: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has served notices on former prime minister and MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and PPP candidate for NA-133 by-poll Aslam Gill for allegedly violating the code of conduct.
The by-election is scheduled to be held on Dec 5.
According to the ECP, MNA Ashraf allegedly participated in the election campaign of Aslam Gill despite a bar.
“Sufficent evidence has been found which corroborates your alleged violation of para-17 of the code of conduct for political parties and contesting candidates issued by the ECP for the conduct of the by-election in NA-133,” the ECP notice to Mr Ashraf reads.

Rs20,000 fine imposed on Shaista Pervaiz

It further says: “In view of the alleged repeated violations, you are called upon to appear in person, along with a written statement, to clarify your position on Nov 29 before the district monitoring officer.” The Election Commission also issued a notice to Mr Aslam Gill for violating the election code of conduct.
“The candidate is accused of taking such steps that may affect voters’ right to franchise,” it said and summoned Mr Gill to appear before the district returning officer on Sunday (today) in person to respond to the allegations in this regard.
Meanwhile, the district monitoring officer has imposed a fine of Rs20,000 on the PML-N candidate for NA-133, Shaista Pervaiz Malik, for violating the code of conduct.
According to the ECP, there is a complete ban on displaying hoardings, billboards, pana-flexes and wall-chalking during the campaign.
The NA-133 seat had fallen vacant after the death of PML-N MNA Parvaiz Malik and the party nominated his wife Shaista Parvaiz Malik to contest for the seat.
The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has already been out of this contest after the party candidate, Jamshed Iqbal Cheema committed a “blunder” by not meeting legal requirements to contest the election, thus giving a virtual walkover to the rival PML-N. The proposer of Mr Cheema and his covering candidate, his wife Musarrat, was not a voter of the constituency they were contesting from.
Following disqualification of its candidate, the PTI has asked its voters to abstain from voting in NA-133 by-election.

1,"Ex-CJP Nisar will have to be answerable, warns Maryam","“Every word of Saqib Nisar [in the audio clip] has compatibility with the events of the last few years,"" she says.","LAHORE: PML-N Vice-President Maryam Nawaz has said former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar will have to be answerable for his deeds as he cannot get away with the allegations he is facing.
“Every word of Saqib Nisar [in the audio clip] has compatibility with the events of the last few years. Saqib Nisar cannot deny these events as he will have to be answerable and face accountability,” she tweeted on Saturday.

 



 
She also uploaded a video of Imran Khan in which he was saying that Justice Asif Khosa had “requested” him to come to the Supreme Court in connection with the Panama Papers.
Earlier, Ms Nawaz had said ex-CJP Nisar should not hide behind his institution (the judiciary). “At least five testimonies had emerged to substantiate the PML-N’s stance that ex-CJP Nisar was actively involved in the conspiracy to disqualify a thrice-elected prime minister [Nawaz Sharif] and sending him and me to jail,” she said.
The PML-N had also asked Mr Nisar to ‘come clean’ about a leaked audio clip of a conversation purportedly held between him and an unidentified man regarding the conviction of former premier Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam, though the former CJP has claimed that the voice in the clip was not his.
In the audio clip, a voice, allegedly Mr Nisar’s, can be heard saying: “Let me be a little blunt about it. Unfortunately, here it is the institutions that dictate judgements. In this case, we will have to punish Mian sahab (Nawaz Sharif).
I have been told `we have to bring Khan sahab (Imran Khan) [into power]’.”
He allegedly goes on to add in the conversation, “Punishment will have to be given.” When the man on the other end of the line says Maryam “doesn’t merit a sentence”, Mr Nisar purportedly tells him: “You are absolutely correct. I talked to my friends that something should be done about this, but they did not agree. There will be no independence of the judiciary. So, let it be.”
As the audio leak remained the top trend on social media, the PML-N asked the former CJP to explain his position on it.

4,"Convicted DC and AC evade arrest, leave for Lahore",Mandi Bahauddin Deputy Commissioner Tariq Basra and Assistant Commissioner Imtiaz Ali were convicted of contempt of court.,"GUJRAT: Mandi Bahauddin Deputy Commissioner Tariq Basra and Assistant Commissioner Imtiaz Ali who were convicted for a contempt of court and awarded three-month imprisonment by the judge of the consumer court have reportedly evaded arrest and left for Lahore.
This happened despite the orders of the judge for their arrest from the courtroom who also asked the district police officer (DPO) to send the convicted officers to Gujrat District Jail instead of Mandi Bahauddin jail. Earlier reports had said that instead of taking the convicts to the jail, as per orders of the court, police had detained the both officers in DC house.
Mandi Bahauddin DPO Sajid Khokhar also went leave until Monday.
On the other hand, uncertainty looms over Mandi Bahauddin district administration in the wake of conviction of DC and AC for contempt of court. The Gujranwala commissioner has handed over the charge of Mandi Bahauddin DC to Additional Deputy Commissioner Revenue (ADCR) Ehsanul Haq Zia on a temporary basis.

DPO goes on leave; ADCR gets charge of DC office

The acting DC said he was unaware of any further move of the DC and AC or the government and he could not talk about the issue. He declined to comment when asked about the whereabouts of the convicted officers.
According to an official of the Gujrat District Jail, both the convicts have not yet been shifted to the jail though the judge had issued a written order of sending them to the said jail after awarding them three months imprisonment.
Official sources say both the officers left for Lahore late on Friday, the day they were convicted. They say the decision of the consumer court, headed by the district and sessions judge, has sent a wave of shock among the civil servants across the country, particularly the administrative officers in Punjab.
Sources in Mandi Bahauddin say both the convicted officers are weighing various options to come out of the situation, including filing an appeal before the Lahore High Court or applying a bail application. They say the officers may move a bail application on Monday (Nov 29).
Mandi Bahauddin consumer court judge Rao Abdul Jabbar, who is also district and sessions judge, had convicted DC and AC for contempt of court in connection with the hearing of a plea by a citizen,
Muhammad Asim, who was forcibly evicted from an official residence in Wapda Colony by Rana Mehboob Ali, a litigation clerk in the local administration.
The court issued notices to the DC and AC to appear before the court; however, they sent the litigation clerk who committed grave misconduct and contempt by misbehaving with the judge. The clerk challenged the authority of the court, as well. At this, the judge convicted him. However, DC Tariq Basra personally made a phone call to the judge and misbehaved with him, asking him to set the clerk free whereas AC Imtiaz Ali also appeared in the court and misbehaved with the judge.
The judge issued notices to both DC and AC under Section 228 of the PPC to appear and personally answer as to why contempt proceedings should not initiated against them. Both the officers appeared in the court on Friday but they could not satisfy the judge. At this, the judge awarded three months imprisonment to both the officers and sent them to the Gujrat District Jail.

6,PML-N launched drive to pressurise institutions: Fawad,Farrukh wants N-League’s apology for Maryam’s clip,"LAHORE: Federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Fawad Chaudhry alleges that the PML-N has launched a consolidated campaign through journalists, anchors and tweeps to pressurise the judiciary and the army and keep focus off from former premier Nawaz Sharif’s cases.
“The simple way to come out of these cases for Mr Sharif is to present ‘receipts’ explaining the sources of funds he used to purchase expensive properties in the UK,” Mr Chaudhry suggested.
“Avoiding answers to the money-laundering allegations will not help you (Mr Sharif),” Mr Chaudhry asserted while speaking to media persons here on Saturday.
The minister said the conspiracy hatched against the judiciary had been exposed. He said the conspiracy that began with Rana Shamim’s affidavit had ended with the unearthing of a racket involved in blackmailing by spreading former Chief Justice Saqib Nisar’s fake audio-tape.

Farrukh wants N-League’s apology for Maryam’s clip

“This is how some elements try to sabotage Nawaz Sharif and PML-N vice-president Maryam cases when they are nearing conclusion,” he said.
Commenting on Rana Shamim’s credibility, Mr Chaudhry said this character was an office-bearer of the PML-N and was appointed as Gilgit-Baltistan chief justice. He said now he was being used to write ‘required’ affidavits.
After the disclosure of fake Calibri font, he said it had now become a norm with the PML-N to create fake videos and audios to pressurise state institutions.
“The judiciary needs to take cognisance of this activity besides lodging cases for tampering with evidence and punish the perpetrators,” he said.
Answering a question about former CJP Saqib Nisar audio tape’s forensic audit by the government itself, Mr Chaudhry said the government could no do so because two judges of the Islamabad High Court had taken this case’s jurisdiction.
“If Maryam considers that the audio tapes are genuine, she should present it to the court for examination,” he said.
Answering a question about Shehbaz Sharif approaching the Election Commission of Pakistan seeking legal action against those involved in Daska by-election rigging, he said the PML-N was a Supreme Court certified party known for rigging elections.
Replying to a question about anti-state institutions’ speeches at the Asma Jahangir Conference, the minister said there should not be any curb on freedom of expression and everything within the ambit of law be allowed. He also said the conference’s funding sources were being investigated.
He said Pakistan would soon come out of the economic crisis and added that daily use items’ prices had already started coming down. “Overall inflation has downslided by 0.67 per cent,” he added.
Mr Chaudhry said the petrol prices had decreased in the international market and added that the impact would reach Pakistan in two months. “If the trend of petrol prices sliding down continues, it will impact greatly in easing economic crisis in the country,” he said.
Farrukh Habib: State Minister for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib said on Saturday that the PML-N should apologise for the audio clip of Maryam Safdar in which she was talking about stopping media ads.
He was talking to the media after attending a two-day second International Conference on Business and Commerce at Hailey College of Commerce, Punjab University, on Saturday.
He said the audio clip of Maryam was proof that the PML-N during its tenure was working as a fascist government. He said the PML-N should also tell the nation in what capacity Maryam was controlling the advertisements for the media.
To another question about the alleged audio leak of former CJP Saqib Nisar, he said, “If PML-N believes in the authenticity of the audio clip, they should make it part of the judicial record. Earlier, former judge Arshad Malik’s video was also released but it was not included in the judicial record,” he said.
Mr Habib said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government was working on judicial reforms, adding that legislation had been done with regard to civil laws.
He said consultations with all stakeholders on reforming the CrPC [Code of Criminal Procedure] had almost been completed and it would be presented in the parliament after getting approval from the cabinet.
He said the IT exports [last year] amounted to $2 billion and would increase to $3bn billion during the current year.
He said universities should focus on developing industry and academia linkages.
He said the world was changing speedily and “it is knowledge economy time.”
“We have set Rs6,000 billion tax collection target for the current year and Rs3,000bn would be paid for loans,” he said.

7,LHC orders inquiry into Indian’s claim to property,The court has directed the chief settlement commissioner of Punjab to hold an inquiry.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court has directed the chief settlement commissioner of Punjab to hold an inquiry to find out any allotment of property made in the name of an Indian citizen in Pakistan.
The court issued this order while dismissing a petition challenging an order of a Lahore’s civil court in litigation among the legal heirs of Muhammad Umar who died in 2002 in India.
The legal heirs are also permanent residents of India and one of them had initiated a civil litigation through a special attorney for the transfer of land allotted to their predecessor being an evacuee citizen.
Abdul Rehman and other heirs submitted through counsel that Umar was a displaced person and was allotted land measuring 23 kanal 9 marla at Malku village in Lahore Cantonment in 1955. They said Umar was in possession of the land in question and died in 2002 and after his death, one Mumriaz Khan fraudulently got entered in the revenue record inheritance mutation which was later cancelled in 2004.
They said they were legal heirs of Umar and they also got a decree from the civil court in 2009.
Justice Chaudhry Muhammad Iqbal, in his verdict, observes that the record of the suit shows that the petitioners are permanent residents of India and that Umar, predecessor of the petitioners, was also a permanent resident of India who never migrated to Pakistan.
The judge observes that Umar was not an evacuee person and was not entitled for any allotment against any evacuee claim in Pakistan and if he had obtained any allotment that was the result of manifest fraud, forgery and misrepresentation.
“The petitioners are also permanent residents of India who are pursuing the instant proceedings of this petition through their special attorney, as such, they are legally debarred to claim any allotment as evacuee persons in Pakistan,” the judge adds.
The judge dismissed the petition being devoid of any force with cost of Rs500,000 to be recovered as arrears of land revenue.
The judge also directed the chief settlement commissioner to conduct a detailed inquiry as to whether any allotment exists in the names of Muhammad Umar, predecessor of the petitioners, or the petitioners and if any other allotment is found to be in existence in record, the commissioner shall cancel the same forthwith and retrieve possession of the land in favour of the state.

Zafar is pursuing a Rs100 million defamation suit against Shafi for leveling ‘false’ allegations of sexual harassment against him.
In an application, Zafar stated the defendant (Shafi) presented a lame excuse of pandemic-related restrictions on the air travel to seek permission for her and her husband’s cross-examination through a video link.
Whereas, he said, the defendant herself announced on social media that she was travelling to Dubai to perform in a musical concert on Nov 28. The counsel for Zafar also attached a copy of Shafi’s tweet wherein she announced her musical performance at the ongoing Dubai Expo 2020.
Zafar stated that under these circumstances Shafi’s application had no justification.
His application said Zafar was already willing to deposit the travel expenses of Shafi and her husband to return to Pakistan for their cross-examination. It also sought an early hearing of the defamation suit which was already fixed for Dec 3.
A duty judge took up the application and issued a notice to Shafi for Nov 29.
Verdict on her application seeking the cross-examination through a video link from Canada was reserved on Nov 17.
In his suit, Zafar had asked the court to issue a decree against Shafi directing her to pay him Rs1bn as damages for leveling the harassment allegation.

“The 223,000 cases of encroachment are in fact receipts of incompetence of the previous governments,” Mr Khawar said while speaking at a news conference here on Saturday.
He said a forensic audit of fire incidents in public offices in the previous government would prove that the officials were hand in glove with the qabza mafia.

The state land belonged to forest, revenue, auqaf and other departments. He said the retrieved land was being handed over to the departments concerned to be used for projects of public welfare.
Mr Khawar said the chief minister had instructed that the remaining 35,000 acres land should be retrieved in the next five weeks.

Giving examples of Orhan Pamuk of Turkey and Haruki Murakami of Japan, he said they were read a lot in their own countries before getting popular in the world.
“Ismail Kadare is popular and people read his novels globally although he writes in Albanian language. Our Karachi is equal to six Albanias,” he said on Saturday in a session on the second day of 8th Faisalabad Literary Festival being held virtually.
The session, titled, Our Literature in Comparison with the World Literature, had Ghazi Salahuddin, fiction writer and critic Nasir Abbas Nayyar and Saeed Naqvi as panelists while it was moderated by Asghar Nadeem Syed.
Salahuddin said it was imperative to note the environment in which literature was being produced rather to first look at the quality of literature. He raised the question of the number of readers in the country and what change a new book could bring about in society. He said we had treasure of novels and literature requiring attention but they could not get attention like those written in other countries.
Ghazi Salahuddin said Oprah Winfrey used to show a book in her show and it would become a best seller but on the contrary, Masood Ashar wrote about four novels in his columns in a reliable Urdu newspaper but nothing happened. Similarly, he added, reviews of books in New York Times also made books the best sellers but situation was different in Pakistan.
Asghar Nadeem said he had asked the committee selecting the vice chancellors to ask the candidates which book they had read and which film they had watched recently. With these two questions, he added, the committee could determine how the candidates’ sensibility had been developed.
Nasir Abbas Nayyar said we lacked the reading habit and discussion on the books being written.
“We have no standing at the international level as our writers are not being appreciated here and that’s why their books are not being translated.”
Mr Nayyar said that the governments in other countries would promote literature internationally but here the governments did not give the same treatment to literature.
Saeed Naqvi termed literature a dialogue between the writer and the readers. He said being reader we want to read the pieces which appealed to us rather than those which contradicted our thoughts.
He lamented that among the population of 200 million people, sale of 500 books of first edition was considered a success.
Four sessions were also held in the festival on Saturday while the same number of sessions would be held on Sunday (today).
