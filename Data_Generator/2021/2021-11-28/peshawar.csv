Earlier, father of the twins from Gahtak Denin village of Chitral had alleged that his children had suffered dehydration after taking the oral polio vaccine (OPV). The Chitral Lower DC had constituted a committee for looking into causes of dehydration of the infants.
In a meeting of the committee presided over by AC Saqlain Saleem, district child specialist Dr Gulzar Ahmed said infants were highly exposed to rotavirus which caused diarrhoea and vomiting.
He said OPV had no contra indication and had no relation with dehydration.
Mr Ahmed contended that doses for 20 children were prepared from a single bottle, and if OPV was the cause, then it should also have affected the rest of 18 children.
He said he examined the twins a day after they suffered dehydration and they had started convalescing after getting medicine through infusion, but their condition deteriorated when they were shifted to their home.

Prize distribution ceremony of sports event held in Swat

“Before this government, there were 64 colleges for women in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but today we have at least 124 colleges for girls in the province which shows how serious is this government about female education,” he said, adding that educated women must come forward and play their role in the progress of the country.

The party had first awarded ticket for the seat of tehsil chairman to former tehsil nazim Haji Hidayatullah Khan. Mr Munawar and his family criticised the decision of party leadership, leaving Hidayatullah with no option but to return the ticket.
The party leadership again ignored Mr Zafarullah, the nephew of the lawmaker, and decided to field district chief Maulana Abdul Rahim in the election for the tehsil top slot.
The Ahmadkhel family rejected the decision and instead announced to support Zafarullah Khan, who had also filed his nomination papers for the tehsil chairman slot.
At a public meeting, MPA Munawar had even declared the award of party ticket to Maulana Rahim as a conspiracy against his family. However, the leadership asked the lawmaker and his family to support the party candidate.
In this regard, JUI-F’s provincial chief Maulana Attaur Rehman and MPAs Maulana Lutfur Rehman and Mehmood Betani held separate meetings with Mr Munawar at his residence in Lakki city a couple of days ago in a bid to persuade him to support Maulana Rahim in the local government elections.
A party leader told this correspondent the exercise proved futile as Mr Munawar stuck to his stand and had urged the party leaders to review their decision.
When contacted, Mr Munawar’s nephew Fawad said on Friday the JUI-F leaders discussed matters pertaining to the local body polls with Ahmadkhel family elders.
However, he said that they had formally launched the campaign for Mr Zafarullah.

9,Shortage of yarn badly affects Swat handloom industry,Dealers say items used in shawls could not be imported due to pandemic,"

SWAT: The dealers associated with the famous handloom industry in Swat said that they were badly affected by the low demand for woolen shawls due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
They said that not only the low demand during the pandemic affected them financially but also the suspension of import of wool, yarn and other items used in the woolen shawls had bad impacts on the production of shawls.
“The high quality wool and yarn, which we use in the woolen shawl, come from China, Kora and Australia but the pandemic has also affected it and we cannot import them easily due to which we cannot produce sufficient shawls and other woolen products,” said Afazal, a dealer of woolen shawls in Salampur.
Salampur, a village near Saidu Sharif, is famous for its handloom industry and high quality of woolen shawls. About 70 per cent of the local people are connected with the industry, earning livelihood for their families. According to local dealers, Salampur houses more than 5,000 handlooms.

Dealers say items used in shawls could not be imported due to pandemic

The local artisans and workers, who used to earn handsome amount by weaving woolen shawls, said that they were also affected financially by the closure of the exports.
“At first we were affected by the lockdown when the handlooms were closed. Now suspension of imports of the stuff used in the woolen shawl from abroad has decreased our earnings,” said Azmat Ali, a local handloom artisan.
He said that he used to weave four woolen shawls a day but now he had to make one or two shawls due to decrease in the supplies of yarn.
The local leaders said that the handloom shawls of Salampur were identified by numbers instead of names. The price of a shawl ranges from Rs800 to Rs40,000. The special shawls made from camel wool cost up to Rs100,000.
The dealers said that before the outbreak of Covid-19, they would stock a large number of woolen shawls in their warehouses in the summer season and would supply them to the cold parts of the country before advent of winter.
However, they said that in the current year they prepared a lesser number of shawls owing to shortage of yarn and other items.

12,All 4 private Covid labs at Peshawar airport unregistered,"Health dept committee also says staff untrained, not following infection prevention guidelines.","PESHAWAR: A health department committee of experts has revealed that all the four private Covid-19 testing labs working at Peshawar’s Bacha Khan International Airport are not registered with the provincial government, have untrained staff members and are largely not complying with infection prevention guidelines.
The department will formally share the panel’s report with NCOC, the country’s nerve centre in the fight against coronavirus, for action, say officials.
The revelation comes as three more people lost life to Covid-19 and 40 were infected with the virus in the province on Saturday.
Of the deaths, two were reported in Peshawar and one in Abbottabad.

Health dept committee also says staff untrained, not following infection prevention guidelines

Officials told Dawn that the health secretary had formed the three-member committee of experts for checking the quality of Covid-19 testing done by four private labs at Peshawar’s airport after several international travellers complained that those labs declared them coronavirus patients a few days after they tested negative for the virus in the US and UK and thus, landing them in quarantine centres.
According to the committee’s report, the four airport-based labs are actually franchises of those based in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi, and began operation on the permission of the national health services ministry without getting themselves registered with the provincial government, so the health department didn’t monitor them.
It added that staff members of those labs were not properly trained in Covid-19 testing, while the recommended infection prevention protocols were also not enforced.
The officials said the airport labs were required by the rules to get registered with the health department for Covid-19 testing but they all were non-compliant.
They said those labs performed tests on ‘rapid kits’ and samples from positive cases were sent to the Public Health Reference Laboratory at the Khyber Medical University, Peshawar, for PCR.
The officials said the confirmed coronavirus patients were sent to quarantine centres and were allowed to go home only after their negative PCR test reports came in.
They also said the airport labs didn’t maintain testing data and therefore, the health department committee didn’t know the number of rapid kits utilised and tests done by them. The officials said the records of Covid-19 testing reports issued by those labs were available.
They said the committee also revealed that there existed no mechanism inside nor outside the labs to check quality control.
The officials said the air-conditioner drains were found at the labs to be in waste bin against bio-safety protocols to stem the transmission of virus, while non-compliance was noted regarding Covid-19 guidelines for proper waste management.
They said social distancing guidelines were also violated at the labs.
Meanwhile, health officials said some private travel agents working in Dean Centre, Saddar Bazaar and University Road issued fake negative Covid-19 clearance certificates to customers without even taking their testing samples.
They said private airlines had own panels of coronavirus labs and those labs got bar codes of Islamabad-based ones that were linked with airline companies and the people flying abroad didn’t have any issue with them.
The officials said the provincial authorities had authorised 20 coronavirus labs, including 13 in public sector and seven in private sector, after examining their facilities, human resources and SOP compliance mechanism.
