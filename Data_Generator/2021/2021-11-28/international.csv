0,Countries convene for pandemic treaty talks,WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wants a treaty to end the sorry cycle of  “neglect and panic”.,"GENEVA: World nations gather on Monday to thrash out whether to pursue a pandemic treaty setting out how to handle the next crisis — which experts fear is only a matter of time.
The three-day meeting at the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Geneva comes with the planet still besieged by Covid-19, nearly two years on from the first recorded cases.
The economic turmoil and millions of lives lost have triggered calls for new international defences strong enough to prevent a repeat disaster.
“We will have more pandemics in the future. The question is not if, but when,” Jaouad Mahjour, the WHO assistant director general for emergency preparedness, told reporters.
The World Health Assembly — the WHO’s decision-making body comprising all 194 member states — is holding an unprecedented special session to consider developing a new accord on pandemic preparedness and response.
The meeting should conclude with a resolution on the way forward. The desired outcome — whether a treaty or another formulation — will come later down the line, potentially as far off as 2024.
But how far countries are prepared to go in agreeing binding terms on getting ready for the next outbreak, and effective systems for stamping it out, remains uncertain.
Rapid regulations or tougher treaty? 
The existing International Health Regulations were simply not designed to handle pandemics on the scale of Covid-19, or ensure equity and preparedness, said Mahjour. Indeed, the word ‘pandemic’ does not even appear in the texts.
Though faster to enter into force, the scope for what can be done via regulations is far narrower than for a treaty.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wants a treaty to end the sorry cycle of  “neglect and panic”.
“The ongoing chaos of this pandemic only underlines why the world needs an iron-clad global agreement to set the rules,” he said. The United States is thought to be less keen on talk of a treaty and more focused on agreeing content with rapid impact.
However, more than 70 countries so far are backing a treaty, the health ministers of 32 of them said in a joint article.
The ministers — from nations including Britain, Chile, Germany, Italy, Kenya, South Korea, Spain, Thailand and Turkey — said a treaty was  “the only substantial proposal” that could ensure a  “rapid, joint, effective, and equitable global response” to future outbreaks. “We cannot wait for the next crisis before we act,” they wrote.
Ensuring equitable access to vaccines, tests and treatments is a key special session issue for many African countries starved of tools to fight this pandemic.
“Whatever we do, we need a continued commitment at the highest political level in the future,” one European diplomat said, adding:  “We need a legally-binding instrument to structure this... it’s too important.” Steve Solomon, the WHO’s chief legal officer, told reporters there was  “good reason to believe” a collective way forward could be found.
‘Get on with it’
The Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response, convened to rake over the failings in tackling Covid-19, reported its findings and recommendations in May. It proposed establishing a WHO framework convention. Under that treaty format, the bulk of it could be agreed quickly and elements could then be added to the framework over time.

1,Taliban won’t ‘interfere’ in other countries’ affairs: PM,KABUL: The Taliban co-founder and now prime minister of Afghanistan Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund pledged on ...,"KABUL: The Taliban co-founder and now prime minister of Afghanistan Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund pledged on Saturday that his government will  “not interfere” in other countries’ internal affairs, and urged international charities to continue offering aid to the war-ravaged country.
Hassan’s audio speech broadcast on state television — his first address to the nation since the Taliban seized power in August — came ahead of next week’s meeting between the United States and the Taliban in Doha.
“We assure all the countries that we will not interfere in their internal affairs and we want to have good economic relations with them,” said Hassan in a nearly 30-minute speech that came amid criticism on social media for remaining silent since the Islamists took power, even as the nation faced severe challenges.
The Taliban seized power on August 15 after ousting the previous US-backed government, as Washington hurriedly withdrew its troops from the country after a 20-year war.
The Taliban’s previous regime was toppled in a US-led invasion after the 9/11 attacks in the United States that were carried out by Al Qaeda, whose now-killed founder Osama bin Laden lived in Afghanistan at that time.

2,China conducts drills near Taiwan Strait,Move follows a contentious visit to the island by a group of American lawmakers.,"BEIJING: The Chinese army has carried out a  “naval and air force combat readiness patrol” near the Taiwan Strait following a contentious visit to the island by a group of American lawmakers, a spokesperson said.
Tensions between Beijing and Washington have soared over the fate of democratic self-ruled Taiwan, which China has vowed to one day retake, by force if necessary.
A group of American lawmakers arrived on the island Thursday offering support for the Taiwanese authorities, who Beijing accuses of seeking independence for the island.
In response, the Chinese army on Friday carried out  “a naval and air force combat readiness patrol in the direction of the Taiwan Strait,” a spokesperson for the Eastern Theater Command said in a statement.
“This is a necessary measure in response to the current situation in the Taiwan Strait,” they added, pledging the army would  “protect sovereignty and territorial integrity of the nation.”  
“The army will continue to be on high alert and take all necessary measures to counter, at any time, any interference by external forces and any conspiracy by separatists aiming at the so-called ‘Taiwan independence’.” No other information about the drills was given.

3,Two killed as powerful storm batters UK,"LONDON: Two people were killed, thousands of homes cut off from power and drivers stuck on freezing roads overnight...","LONDON: Two people were killed, thousands of homes cut off from power and drivers stuck on freezing roads overnight as a powerful storm hit the northern UK, authorities said on Saturday.
One woman tweeted a video of her flight from Paris struggling to land in Manc­hester, northwest England, in high winds late on Friday.
Passengers’ nervous laughter gave way to screams and sobs before the pilot aborted the landing, succeeding on a second attempt. The UK’s meteorological service issued a rare  “red weather” warning as  “Storm Arwen” brou­ght wind gusts of almost 100 miles (160 kilometres) per hour. 
“People should stay away from the coast as waves and debris are a danger to life,” the Met Office warned.
One man was killed when his car was struck by a falling tree in Northern Ireland late on Friday, police said. Another man died when he was hit by a tree in the Lake District, northwest England.
The severe gale left 75,000 homes still without power on Saturday in Scotland, according to the country’s electricity utility.
Express train services were suspended north of Newcastle and roads closed by fallen debris in parts of Scotland, while snowfall from Friday afternoon brought disruption to routes more widely.
The snow and fallen trees caused road blockages across northern England and Scotland, forcing many drivers to sleep in their vehicles overnight, according to traffic police and social media.
Around 120 lorries were  “stuck in the snow” on one section of motorway between Manchester and Leeds, police said, tweeting pictures of the road blanketed in white before snow ploughs could be deployed.
While the winds had eased by Saturday morning, the Met Office warned conditions would remain challenging because of ice and snow, and the public was urged to avoid non-essential travel.
The railway operator for southwest England warned of  “multiple trees and obstr­uctions blocking the railway”. ScotRail services were suspended between Edin­burgh and Glasgow after a barn was blown onto the line.
The storm also forced the cancellation of at least one lower-league football fixture and a horse racing meet later on Saturday.

4,Riot police deployed in Iranian city after 67 arrested,Dozens arrested in violent protests over the drying up of a lifeblood river.,"TEHRAN: Riot police were deployed in force on Saturday in the Iranian city of Isfahan, a day after dozens were arrested in violent protests over the drying up of a lifeblood river. 
Security forces fired tear gas during the clashes with stone-throwers in the protest in the dry bed of the Zayadneh Rood river that crosses the city, Fars and ISNA news agencies said. 
“We have arrested 67 of the main actors and agitators behind the troubles,” police General Hassan Karami said on Saturday. He said between 2,000 and 3,000 “rioters” took part in the protest. 
On Saturday, the situation was “calm” and streets empty, with riot police deployed on the city’s Khadjou bridge, an Isfahan city resident said. 
The demonstration was the latest since protests kicked off on November 9 in Isfahan, some 340 kilometres south of Tehran, a tourist magnet due to its majestic mosques and heritage sites, including a historic bridge across the river. 
But it was the first to turn violent. 
Between 30,000 and 40,000 farmers and city residents turned up for the gatherings last week, estimated Gen Karami. 
The riverbed has been the rallying spot for farmers and other people from across Isfahan province protesting the lack of water since November 9. 
Drought is a reason, but they also accuse the authorities of diverting water from the city to supply the neighbouring province of Yazd, which is also desperately short on supplies. 
“I used to walk along the riverbed with friends, but today the riot police are deployed in large numbers near the Khadjou bridge and they are asking people to avoid the area,” said a woman in her 50s. 
During the clashes on Friday, some people set fire to objects in the city, Fars and ISNA reported. “After the farmers left, the opportunists and counter-revolutionaries were left behind, which made it easy for the security apparatus, especially the police, to identify and arrest those who destroyed public and state property,” Isfahan police chief Mohammad-Reza Mirheidari said on television. 
But members of the security forces were hit by fire from hunting rifles, he said, without specifying how many. 
One of them was stabbed, although his condition was not believed to be critical. 
A Fars journalist said two bulldozers were used to destroy a pipe taking water from Isfahan province to Yazd. 
“Among the injured demonstrators, two are in a serious condition,” Nourodin Soltanian, spokesman for Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, told the Mehr news agency on Saturday.  Recently, there have been almost daily protests in the region of Isfahan, which has been hit particularly hard by drought. 
On Saturday, the ultra-conservative daily Kayhan pointed the finger of blame for the violence at “mercenary thugs”, whereas the pro-reform Etemad said the protests in Isfahan showed a “lack of trust in the government”. 
Last Sunday, more than 1,000 people marched towards the governor’s office in the western province of Chahar-Mahal Bakhtiari to demand a solution to water shortages, state media reported. 
According to Fars, farmers and local authorities struck a deal on Thursday about water distribution. 
President Ebrahim Raisi met representatives from the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd and Semnan earlier this month and vowed to resolve water issues. 
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said the topic is the country’s top problem, without making reference to the protests.

5,UK scientist backs vaccines against Omicron,"“The processes of how one goes about developing a new vaccine are increasingly well-oiled,"" he says.","LONDON: The British scientist who led the research underpinning AstraZeneca’s coronavirus jab said on Saturday a new vaccine could be developed against the emerging Omicron variant  “very rapidly” if needed.
Professor Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, also said existing vaccines should work against the new strain, but that would only become apparent after more research in the coming weeks.
“It’s extremely unlikely that a reboot of a pandemic in a vaccinated population like we saw last year (with the Delta variant) is going to happen,” he told BBC radio.
But if required,  “The processes of how one goes about developing a new vaccine are increasingly well-oiled, so if it’s needed that is something that could be moved very rapidly.” 
The UK government announced new travel restrictions affecting inbound passengers from six African countries including South Africa.
The United States and European countries have followed suit on the restrictions, and the variant has been confirmed in Belgium.In a statement, AstraZeneca said it had  “developed, in close collaboration with Oxford University, a vaccine platform that enables us to respond quickly to new variants that may emerge”.
The UK-based drugs company said it was  “already conducting research in locations where the variant has been identified”.
Vaccine makers Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax have also said they are confident of being able to combat the Omicron strain.

Alvin Chau, head of Suncity Group, is wanted by prosecutors in China’s Wenzhou city on alleged cross-border gambling activities and causing  “severe damage to the social order of the country”, state media reported.
Almost all gambling is forbidden in China but permitted in Macau, a former Portuguese colony that boasts a bigger casino industry than Las Vegas.
The vast majority of punters are mainlanders and junket operators like Suncity arrange for high-rollers to come to Macau for legal gambling. Macau’s government confirmed Chau was among a group of people taken in for questioning on Saturday over the warrant.

7,Police protest against security law reform in Madrid,MADRID: Thousands of police protested in Madrid on Saturday over plans to reform a controversial security law ...,"MADRID: Thousands of police protested in Madrid on Saturday over plans to reform a controversial security law banning the unauthorised use of police images if it puts them in danger.
The rally focused on plans by Spain’s left-wing government to change the citizen security law, known as the  “gag law”, passed in 2015 under the previous right-wing administration at the height of the anti-austerity protests. The reform bill aims to bring the law in line with a Constitutional Court ruling that requiring authorisation to use images of police was  “unconstitutional” because it amounted to  “prior censorship”.
Waving Spanish flags and union banners, the protesters, accompanied by senior right-wing politicians, marched to the interior ministry in a rally called by Jusapol, an umbrella organisation from which emerged the police and Guardia Civil unions.
They say such reform would remove protection from police and security forces, endanger public security and reduce operational ability to stop violent demonstrations.
“We say no to this reform. We believe the law must be adapted to current times and must be reformed, but we must never trample the rights of those responsible for security who work with this law every day,” Jusapol president Miguel ngel Gmez told reporters.
Speaking at the march, opposition leader Pablo Casado, who heads the right-wing Popular Party, said he fully supported the protesters’ demands.
“Every day four police officers are assaulted and this is absolutely intolerable,” said Casado, urging Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez  “to listen to the street and to the thousands of police who have risked their lives to defend Spanish democracy and freedom.”
