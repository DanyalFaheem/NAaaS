0,UK court upholds decision to cancel Malik Riaz visa,"Malik Riaz and Ahmed Ali Riaz's ""exclusion from the UK is conducive to public good,"" judgement states.","LONDON: A UK court of appeal has upheld a Home Office decision to cancel the 10-year multiple-entry visit visas of Bahria Town founder Malik Riaz and his son, Ahmed Ali Riaz, on the grounds that their “exclusion from the UK is conducive to the public good”.
The Home Office decision to cancel their visas was taken after the top immigration body considered the National Crime Agency’s (NCA) investigation and settlement of £190 million with Mr Riaz in 2019; Supreme Court judgements concerning Bahria Town in May 2018 and March 2019; a Joint Investigation Team (JIT) report probing money deposited by Bahria Town into fake accounts and a National Accountability Bureau (NAB) reference filed in April 2019 linking Bahria Town to an investigation into Karachi Land Developments.

While rejecting the appeal, the UK court judgement notes that the conclusion of the Home Office that Mr Riaz and his son have been involved with corruption and financial/commercial misconduct was founded on their involvement in the affairs of Bahria Town — a company owned and run by the appellants’ family and described as the largest property developer in Asia.
Both the court and Home Office heavily relied on SC judgements and orders, NAB inquiries and the JIT report linked to Bahria Town. 

Despite multiple challenges filed by Bahria Town owner and son, Home Office decision to cancel visit visas stands

Timeline of events 
Mr Riaz and his son had held 10-year visit visas to the UK valid till July 28, 2021 and May 18, 2021, respectively. The Home Office cancelled the visas on December 10, 2019, a week after the NCA announced its probe and settlement with the Bahria Town founder.
In attempt to resolve a dispute before court proceedings are initiated, Mr Riaz’s lawyers filed a pre-action protocol (PAP) letter to the Home Office, which took a fresh cancellation decision against their visas on January 31, 2020.
Subsequently, they filed a judicial review application to the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber). A judicial review is a type of court proceeding in which a judge reviews the lawfulness of a decision made by a public body, in this case, the Home Office. On November 17, 2020, the tribunal dismissed Mr Riaz’s claim for a judicial review, and found no wrongdoing in how the Home Office made its decision about the visas’ cancellation.
Mr Riaz and his son then mounted an appeal on seven grounds in the Royal Courts of Justice that upheld the tribunal’s decision on the judicial review. 
A detailed judgement outlining the grounds of appeal, the evidence considered by the Home Office as well as the decision taken to cancel the visas was published by the court on November 26.
Immigration law and Home Office decision 
The judgement features the letters written by the Home Office to Mr Riaz and his son informing them of the decision to cancel their visas.
One such letter reads, “…whilst there has not been a criminal conviction against you I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that you have been involved with corruption and financial/commercial misconduct. As a result, having regard to the UKs commitment to combat corruption and financial crime, I believe that your exclusion from the UK is conducive to the public good due to your conduct, character and associations.”
The judgement notes that the conclusion of the Home Office that Mr Riaz and his son have been involved with corruption and financial/commercial misconduct was founded on their involvement in the affairs of Bahria Town.
According to the Home Office, an exclusion decision is a personal decision of the Secretary of State, on the ground that it is conducive to the public good. This means that it is undesirable to admit the person to the UK because they pose a threat to UK society. 
The appellants’ visas were cancelled under V 9.1 and V 9.6 of Appendix V of the Immigration Rules read with paragraphs V 3.3. The Home Office rules note that a person does not need to have been convicted of a criminal offence for this provision to apply.
In response to their PAP letters, the Home Office wrote, “I have taken into account the fact that these were not criminal proceedings and that the Supreme Court of Pakistan stopped short of making a finding of bribery. However, I consider that the majority judgments of the Court provide strong support for the conclusion that Bahria Town, you and/or your associates benefited financially from the proceeds of illegitimate activities. By way of example, the court judgment features the following quote ‘Grant of land to MDA for an incremental housing scheme proved to be a gimmick to accomplish the agenda of Malik Riaz aiming at his personal enrichment at the cost of the state and the people. It is, thus, a brazen betrayal of the trust of the state and the people and a blatant fraud on the statute’ (Paragraph 12) which strongly supports this conclusion.”
Grounds of appeal
Mr Riaz and his son had challenged the tribunal’s decision on seven grounds. They maintained that 1) the judge wrongly rejected their challenge to the UK government reliance on the SC judgement in concluding that the appellants were involved in corruption; 2) challenge to the respondent’s approach to the SC implementation bench order; 3) challenge to the respondent’s approach to the JIT report in the fake accounts case; 4) challenge to the respondent’s approach to the NAB’s interim reference; (5) challenge to the respondent’s approach to the account freezing proceedings; (6) challenge to the respondent’s cumulative reliance on weak strands of evidence and (7) challenge to the respondent’s failure to acknowledge the differences in the evidence against the appellants.
The judgement summarised the appellants’ case by saying that the rationality challenge is that the decision-maker (Home Office) failed to take into account relevant considerations such as the content and implication of Baqar J’s dissenting opinion in the SC judgment and the fact that the JIT report is said to be superseded by the NAB reference. The appellants also said that the decision-maker took into account irrelevant considerations such as the NCA’s reliance on the same material emanating from Pakistan and Bahria Town’s agreement to pay “a vast sum of money as consideration for a vast amount of land, valued at market price”.
Mr Riaz and his son further maintained that the Home Office and the tribunal wrongly concluded that the majority opinions provided serious and/or cogent evidence of corruption.
The appellants pointed out the allegations contained in the JIT report and the NAB reference were in respect of a separate matter, the fake account case. They argued that the JIT report is no more than a prosecutorial document containing untried and untested allegations and that it makes no mention of Mr Ali, thus it could not be relied upon to conclude he was guilty of alleged offences.
To conclude, Mr Riaz and his son said the individual strands of evidence relied upon by the decision-maker amounted to weak evidence of corruption.
Discussion and conclusion
To conclude, Lady Justice Nicola Davies concluded that in approaching the issue of the exclusion of a person from the UK on the ground that it is conducive to the public good due to the individual’s conduct, character and associations, a broad discretion is accorded to the decision-maker, in this case the Home Office.
The judge applied a civil standard of proof with the qualification that the seriousness of the allegation is to be reflected in the quality of the evidence required which is to be subject to critical and anxious scrutiny.
The judge noted, “I regard the findings that each appellant had a ‘significant association’ with Bahria Town and that ‘on the balance of probabilities, you would have had knowledge of the operations of Bahria Town’ as being logically and reasonably based upon the totality of the evidence before the decision-maker. In my view there are critical findings linking each appellant to the activities of Bahria Town and, following from that, possessing knowledge of the same.”
“It is clear from each letter that the decision-maker considered all three judgments of the Supreme Court dated 4 May 2018. In my judgement, the decision maker was entitled to place substantial weight upon the majority judgments and to the issues and concerns contained therein… It was accepted by the decision-maker that the Supreme Court proceedings were not criminal. It was not the role of the Supreme Court to make findings of specific criminal offences. It is accepted that neither appellant has a criminal conviction in Pakistan or the UK.”
Regarding the JIT report, the judge held, “I accept that the JIT report was a prosecutorial report but that does not diminish the scope of its investigation, nor the detail and analysis which led to its findings. It was a report which was required to be subjected to critical scrutiny by the decision-maker and it was.”
The judge noted that the decision-maker considered separate strands of evidence. “The approach which was properly taken by the decision-maker was to consider the totality of the evidence. The Home Office Guidance states: ‘You must assess if there are cumulative grounds for refusing a person on character, conduct or associations grounds.’ It was open to the decision-maker to consider the cumulative effect of each strand of evidence and in so doing to draw inferences having regard to the whole of the evidence. The totality principle requires relevant evidence to be examined cumulatively and not piece by piece.”
At the end, the judge was “satisfied that the cumulative effect of: i) the evidence and findings set out in the majority judgments of the Supreme Court in May 2018; ii) the significantly increased sum of money paid by Bahria Town for the Karachi land in the 2019 Implementation proceedings; and iii) the detail provided in the JIT investigation, which was consistent with the findings of Khan J and Arab J; of themselves provided evidence of sufficient strength and quality to enable the decision-maker, on the balance of probabilities, to conclude that by reason of each appellant’s involvement with corruption and financial/ commercial misconduct his exclusion from the UK would be conducive to the public good due to the conduct, character and associations of each appellant. Further, it is clear from the detail of each letter that the evidence had been subject to critical scrutiny by the decision maker.”

1,FO assails RSS chief’s remarks on partition,ISLAMABAD: The Fore­ign Office on Saturday hit back at RSS chief Mohan Bha­gwat’s provocative rem­arks about...,"ISLAMABAD: The Fore­ign Office on Saturday hit back at RSS chief Mohan Bha­gwat’s provocative rem­arks about partition, asking the extremist Hindu group to accept “established realities” and learn to peacefully co-exist with Pakistan.  
“Those belonging to the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Par­ty) and its ideological fountainhead RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) would be well-advised to refrain from making such provocative and irresponsible statements, accept the establis­h­ed realities, and learn to follow the imperatives of pea­­ceful coexistence,” said FO Spokesman Asim Iftikhar.  
He was responding to Bha­g­wat’s remarks at the lau­nch of a book about the par­tition of subcontinent in Noida, India, on Friday. “The solution to the pain of partition is in undoing it,” Bhagwat had said.  
“This is India of 2021 and not of 1947. Partition has happened once, it won’t happen again. Those who think that way will face partition themselves,” he had further said.  
Iftikhar said Bhagwat’s remarks were “highly provocative and irresponsible”. He said the RSS chief had “publicly indulged in such delusional thinking and historical revisionism” in the past as well.  
RSS was staunchly opposed to the partition of subcontinent and had mobilised Hindus against it at that time.  
The FO spokesman said that Pakistan had repeatedly highlighted the threat posed to regional peace and stability by the toxic mix of the extremist ‘Hindutva’ ideology (Hindu Rashtra) and expansionist foreign policy (Akhand Bharat) being pursued by the ruling RSS-BJP dispensation in India.  
“In the internal context, this dangerous mindset aims to completely marginalise and dispossess the minorities in India. In the external dimension, it poses an existential threat to all of India’s neighbours in South Asia.”

2,New Covid strain prompts govt to place travel curbs,"• Seven countries, including South Africa, placed in category C • Minister asks citizens to get vaccinated without delay...","• Seven countries, including South Africa, placed in category C
• Minister asks citizens to get vaccinated without delay
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Satur­day placed seven countries in category ‘C’ and imposed a ban on direct and indirect inbound travel from these regions with immediate effect following the emergence of ‘Omicron’ — a virulent strain of Covid-19 — in South Africa and its subsequent transmission to several countries.
Passengers from South Africa, Hong Kong, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Botswana will face the travel ban. “A complete ban has also been enforced on direct and indirect travel from these high-risk countries,” a notification issued by the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) stated, explaining that the countries have been included in category ‘C’ due to the surfacing of Omicron coronavirus variant in South Africa and its spread to adjoining regions.



 
Omicron has been classified by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as “highly transmissible” variant — the same category that includes the predominant Delta variant.
The strain was first detected in South Africa this week, with scientists holding it responsible for the recent spike in Covid-19 infections in Gauteng, the country’s most populous province.
“However, Pakistani passengers tra­velling from these countries on ext­r­e­me emergency will only be allowed after obtaining exemptions and a number of health/testing protocols including presenting vaccination certificates, negative PCR report (72 hours old maximum) before boarding and rapid antigen tests (RAT) on arrival at the airport.” 
The NCOC statement said RAT negative cases would undergo three-day mandatory home quarantine and re-RAT would be conducted on the third day by the civil administration. 
Positive cases would have to observe a mandatory quarantine (government/self-paid) for 10 days after which a PCR test would be carried out, it stated. “To facilitate stranded Pakistanis, travel from these countries will be allowed till Dec 5 without exemption but above-mentioned health/testing protocols will remain applicable,” the statement added.
Moreover, the Aviation Division, Airport Management and Airport Security Force have been directed to devise a mechanism to screen passengers traveling from category C countries through indirect flights and share it with the relevant authorities by Nov 29.
Meanwhile, Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar, who also heads the NCOC, advised people to get themselves as well as their children over the age of 12 years vaccinated at the earliest in the wake of new Covid variant.
“Based on the emergence of the new Covid variant, notification has been issued restrict travel from 6 South African countries and Hong Kong. The emergence of new variant makes it even more urgent to vaccinate all eligible citizens 12 years and older,” the minister tweeted.
The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) also expressed its concerns over the classification of the new variant by the WHO as “highly transmissible”.
According to the PMA statement, Omicron was detected in South Africa where very mild to moderate symptoms of the variant were clinically found with no loss of smell or taste. The PMA warned the government to be vigilant and take urgent measures to prevent the variant entering into Pakistan. 
The PMA stated: “We strongly suggest the government to improve the facilities at airports and other entry points of the country to scan and monitor passengers and resume antigen Covid-19 test at airports, especially for passengers arriving from high-risk countries particularly South Africa.”

3,Commission sought to probe ex-CJP audio leak,"The petition, filed by Sindh High Court Bar Association president, seeks inquiry to restore public confidence in judiciary.","ISLAMABAD: The Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) and a judicial com­mission member from Sindh on Sat­u­rday moved the Islam­a­bad High Court (IHC) for constitution of independent co­mmission to asc­er­tain authenticity of the alleged audio of former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar and probe certain events be­fore and after a former premier’s conviction.
The petition filed by SHCBA Pre­si­dent Salahuddin Ahmed and member of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (Sindh) Syed Haider Imam Rizvi highlighted the events which were reported in the mainstream media prior, during and after the conviction of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) supremo Nawaz Sharif, his daughter and son-in-law. 
The registrar office of high court has fixed the petition before Chief Justice Athar Minallah for hearing on Monday.
The petition requested the IHC to ap­point an independent commission co­m­prising members or retired jud­ges of superior judiciary, legal professionals, journalists and civil society members to undertake “a comprehensive inquiry” to ascertain authenticity or otherwise of the “audio recording purported to be of former Chief Justice Saqib Nisar”.

Petition seeks transparent inquiry to restore public confidence in judiciary

The petitioners urged the court to empower that commission to also probe the events/allegations hurled at the judiciary prior and after the conviction of the Sharif family. According to the petition, “series of events that have taken place tend to erode the credibility, reputation and independence of the judiciary in the eyes of the people.”
The petition also mentioned a letter dated April 28, 2017 written by the then chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to Supreme Court’s registrar after having a phone conversation with him in which the former was told to expect a Whatsapp call. “The then chairman received a call on Whatsapp from a USA number werein the caller said ‘the directions are that the name of Mr Bilal Rasool should be included in the new panel’,” the petition stated. It explained that in the context of the said letter the panel that he [caller] was referring to was the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) ordered to be formed by the Hon’ble Supreme Court on April 20, 2017 on the petition of Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and Imran Khan.
Another event the petition described was the speech of former justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiuqi to the Rawalpindi Bar Association on July 21, 2018 in which he accused officials of a spy agency of “manipulating judicial proceedings and that the Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court had accepted ISI instructions regarding constitution of benches to hear cases involving the former premier Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz”. The petition recalled that Justice Siddiqui was put on show cause notice following his speech before being dismissed from service.
The petitioners referred to Maryam Nawaz’s presser on July 6, 2019 as a third event in which she released the alleged video confession of a former judge of the accountability court Arshad Malik to have convicted the ex-premier ‘under duress’.
According to the petition, the affidavit of former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) that surfaced on November 15, 2021 was the fourth event. In the affidavit, Rana Mohammad Shamim accused former CJP Saqib Nisar of asking the IHC judge “that Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz Sharif must not be released on bail before the general elections at any cost.”
Later on November 20, an audio in which ex-CJP Nisar allegedly could be heard talking about the conviction of Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz went viral on the social media. This was described as the fifth event. 
The petition mentioned that all those events undermined public confidence in the judiciary and damaged its reputation for independence and neutrality in the eyes of the general public which ultimately impinge access to justice. “While various aspects of the aforementioned events are sub-judice before various courts, the underlying question of the truth or falsity of the allegations of outside interference with judicial functions and, in particular, the audio recording of former CJP Saqib Nisar is yet to be considered at any judicial forum,” it stated.
Public trust
The SHCBA and the judicial commission member through the petition highlighted the need for restoration of public confidence in judiciary by “conducting a comprehensive, free, fair and impartial inquiry”.

4,Supreme Court sounds alarm over child pornography,One of the reasons for the rise of child abuse/rape cases is child pornographic content: Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi.,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Saturday deplored that the most alarming social evil is child pornography that has wreaked havoc and poses a great threat to morality as well as the future of children. 
“One of the reasons for the rise of child abuse/rape cases is squarely child pornographic content,” regretted Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi in a judgement he wrote. 
A two-judge Supreme Court bench comprising Justice Maqbool Baqar and Justice Naqvi had taken up an appeal of Umer Khan against the rejection of his bail application by the Peshawar High Court. The petitioner had sought post-arrest bail in a case registered against him under Section 22(1) of Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 at a cyber crime reporting centre in Abbottabad. 

Appeal of accused against PHC’s refusal to grant him bail rejected

Khan faces charges of sharing child pornographic content on social networking website Facebook. On receiving information from the website, the matter was inquired into by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and subsequently a first information report was registered and the petitioner arrested. 
In his judgement, Justice Naqvi observed that there are concerns regarding child sexual abuse and exploitation in the past too, but due to various factors, the gravity and impact of the offence of child pornography is increasing at an alarming rate and this menace needs to be curbed with an iron fist. 
Although the offence the petitioner had been charged with did not fall into the prohibitory clause of Section 497 of CrPC and the maximum punishment for the same is seven years, the nature of the accusation, its impact on society and the material collected so far merit the case to be included within the exception of granting bail when the offence falls within the non-prohibitory clause, the judgement explained. 
It regretted that it is yet to be determined since when was the petitioner involved in spreading child pornography and how many videos he had shared so far. In any case, it added, it is a crime to “hollow out society”, therefore, the argument of the petitioner’s counsel was of no help. Even otherwise, this petition is barred by three days and no plausible explanation for the condonation of the delay has been given, the judgement said. 
Consequently, the court dismissed the appeal with a directive to the trial court to proceed expeditiously and conclude the case as early as possible.
