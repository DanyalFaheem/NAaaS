Abid, who reached the 1,000-run mark in his 15th Test, closed in on his fourth century to stay unbeaten on 93 while Abdullah was batting on 52 as Pakistan reached 145-0 at stumps owing to bad light, 185 shy of Bangladesh’s first-innings total. 
“In the afternoon, it started to spin a bit,” Abid said. “The ball was old. So it was gripping and doing a few other tricks. Our plan was that we have to stay at the wicket and utilise the bad balls. 
“We are in good position now and will try to take it session by session. Our first target is to go past Bangladesh’s 330 and then we will try to take a big lead to give our bowlers an advantage.”
Abid struck the first three boundaries when Abdullah struggled to get off the mark. 
Abdullah flicked through midwicket for four off pacer Abu Jayed and grew with confidence. 
Abid was fluent in his approach and glanced off-spinner Mehidy Hasan for a couple to reach his third half-century off 84 balls. 
Abdullah brought up his half-century in style, clubbing occasional bowler Mominul Haque for the maximum.
Bangladeshs hope of racking up a substantial total was dashed by fast bowler Hasan earlier. 
Hasan broke Bangladesh’s resistance in the first session as the home side resumed on 253-4. 
He alone took four wickets on day two with Bangladesh adding just 77 runs for the rest of the six wickets. 
Hasan’s sixth five-for was well-complemented by his new ball partner Shaheen Shah Afridi who returned figures of 2-70 and medium pacer Faheem Ashraf, 2-54. 
For Bangladesh, Liton Das top-scored with 114 after hitting his maiden century and Mushfiqur Rahim added 91. Mehidy Hasan was not out on 38. 
“When we lost four wickets before lunch, everyone thought we would be bowled out early. Mushfiqur and I put together a good partnership,” said Liton. “By the end of the day, we were thinking about a big total. But cricket is unpredictable. Pakistan are in a good position now. If we can take two or three wickets tomorrow morning, we will be back on par.” 
Liton, starting the day with 113, added just one run before Hasan had him leg-before, which the umpire disagreed, only for the decision be overturned on review. 
Debutant Yasir Ali spent some nervy moments in the crease and survived a leg-before review by Pakistan. 
However, he got off the mark in international cricket with a cover-drive four off Shaheen on the 14th ball he faced. 
But Hasan tested him with short balls and finally rattled his leg and middle stumps with a delivery that jagged in sharply. 
Bangladesh relied on overnight unbeaten Mushfiqur to take the side to safety and he grew with confidence, hitting Shaheen for a boundary through backward point. 
Medium pacer Faheem moved the ball nicely to coax an edge from him as Mushfiqur, who reviewed the decision in vain, fell nine runs short of his eighth century. 
After losing three wickets for just 23 runs, the much-needed resistance came from Mehidy who guided lower order amid the well directed short ball barrage of Shaheen and Hasan. 
Hasan cleaned up the tail to bring an end to the innings.

1,Arsenal stroll past rock-bottom Newcastle,Newcastle now face back-to-back home games against fellow strugglers Norwich City and Burnley.,"LONDON: Arsenal returned to winning ways and deepened Newcastle United’s relegation worries as goals by Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli sealed a comfortable 2-0 Premier League win on Saturday. 
Bottom club Newcastle had new manager Eddie Howe on the touchline for the first time, but it made no difference as they were well beaten and remain without a league win after 13 games. 
Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal, whose 10-match unbeaten run in all competitions came to a juddering halt at Liverpool last week, dominated the opening half with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang missing a sitter. 
But their patience was rewarded as Saka finished superbly in the 56th minute before substitute Martinelli volleyed the second with his first touch. 
Newcastle’s Jonjo Shelvey was denied by the woodwork in the first half but once they went behind, a 17th defeat in 18 league games against Arsenal looked inevitable. 
“I’m happy with the points after losing to Liverpool. You have to win straightaway,” Arteta said. “The word was we had to be patient. We had to play with urgency and rhythm. We found spaces and that’s how we scored the goals.” 
Arsenal stayed fifth in the table, level on points with fourth-placed West Ham United while Newcastle, who have six points and are five behind 17th-placed Leeds United, are the sixth different team to fail to win any of their opening 13 Premier League games. 
Of those, only Derby County in 2000-01 survived relegation. 
Howe, who had to watch last week’s 3-3 draw against Brentford from a hotel room due to a positive Covid-19 test, took some encouragement from his team’s display. 
“I thought it was a good performance, especially the start. We were good for the first half an hour,” he said. “The pleasing thing today is how we started and finished the game. We created chances.” 
Newcastle now face back-to-back home games against fellow strugglers Norwich City and Burnley. 
“We just have to look at the first one,” Howe said. “Momentum in football is so important. We need to get that win as quickly as we can.”

2,Women’s World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe cancelled due to virus concerns,"“We are incredibly disappointed to have to cancel the remainder of this event,"" says ICC official.","JOHANNESBURG: The women’s cricket World Cup qualifying tournament in Zimbabwe has been abandoned after the discovery of a new Covid-19 variant in South Africa that prompted travel curbs, the sport’s governing body (ICC) said on Saturday.
The detection of the new coronavirus variant called Omicron in South Africa forced a number of countries to tighten border controls and impose curbs on travel from several southern African countries, including Zimbabwe.
The ICC took the decision after Saturday’s game between the West Indies and Sri Lanka was called off when a member of the Sri Lankan support staff tested positive for COVID-19.
“We are incredibly disappointed to have to cancel the remainder of this event,” Chris Tetley, the ICC Head of Events, said in a statement.
“But with travel restrictions from a number of African countries being imposed at such short notice, there was a serious risk that teams would be unable to return home.
“We have explored a number of options to allow us to complete the event but it isn’t feasible and we will fly the teams out of Zimbabwe as soon as possible.”
Bangladesh, Pakistan and the West Indies will progress to next year’s World Cup in New Zealand by virtue of their rankings, the ICC said. They will join hosts New Zealand, Australia, India, England and South Africa.
“We are disappointed for all the players and teams who are in Zimbabwe at the moment, but from a health and safety perspective this is the correct decision,” said Richard Holdsworth, High Performance Director for Cricket Ireland.
South African sport began to shut down on Friday as the travel bans forced rugby teams and golfers to scramble to try to leave the country.

Rizwan Ali, Pakistan’s promising drag flicker, scored a brilliant hat-trick — scoring all goals on penalty corners — while Awad Husein scored a field goal for Egypt in the 22nd minute of the game at the Kalinga Stadium.
Pakistan’s forward line attacked the Egyptian goal post several times whose goalkeeper Mahmoud Saleem made a number of impressive saves.
Rizwan took advantage of the penalty corners in the 19th, 32nd and 53rd minutes to score.
Vice-captain Moin Shakeel was declared man-of-the-match.
Speaking after the match, Moin said Pakistan would make a better strategy for the next game. 
“[Against Egypt] we followed the plan given by the coach and got penalty corners which we took advantage of,” he said. “We will adopt a better match strategy against Argentina in our last pool match.”
Pakistan, who lost their opening pool match against heavyweights Germany 5-2, face Argentina on Sunday.
Argentina thrashed Egypt 14-0 in their opening match but went down 3-2 to Germany and Pakistan will need to beat them in order to reach the quarter-finals.

Rain forced Friday’s first ODI at Centurion to be abandoned. The boards had said it was  “highly unlikely” the visiting team would be able to fly out of the country over the weekend.
The decision came as a result of  “mounting anxiety and concern” from the Dutch side with travel bans and restrictions on flights from South Africa being imposed by the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union.
“It must be made clear that the concerns are strictly over travel issues and how soon the team can get home and have nothing to do with the integrity of the Bio-Secure Environment that CSA has successfully hosted,” KNCB chairman Jurgen Delfos said.

5,Vaughan apologises for Rafiq’s pain but denies racism,LONDON: Former England captain Michael Vaughan said he is sorry for all the hurt Azeem Rafiq has experienced...,"LONDON: Former England captain Michael Vaughan said he is sorry for all the hurt Azeem Rafiq has experienced following his ex-Yorkshire team-mate’s revelations about racism in English cricket. 
Rafiq, a player of Pakistani descent, told a British parliamentary committee last week that he had suffered “inhuman” treatment in his time at Yorkshire and described the sport in England as riddled with racism. 
Rafiq also alleged that Vaughan told him and two other players of Asian origin that there were “too many of you lot, we need to do something about it”, before a match in 2009. 
Vaughan has denied the allegation, saying he never made racist comments while at Yorkshire. 
“It hurts deeply, hurts me that a player has gone through so much be treated so badly at the club that I love,” Vaughan told the BBC. 
“I have to take some responsibility for that because I played for Yorkshire County Cricket Club for 18 years and if in any way shape or form I’m responsible for any of his hurt, I apologise for that.” 
The BBC on Wednesday said Vaughan will play no part in their coverage of the upcoming Ashes series after being named in the racism controversy involving Rafiq. 
The 47-year-old, who has been an analyst with the BBC since 2009, was dropped from a radio show by the broadcaster this month after the allegations came to light. 
“Time I don’t think can ever be a healer in the situation that he [Rafiq] has gone through,” Vaughan added. 
“But, hopefully, time can be a way of us making sure that Yorkshire County Cricket Club never goes through this situation again and never puts themselves in a position of denial that they treated a player so badly.” 
Vaughan also apologised for a series of offensive historic tweets, including one questioning the lack of English speakers in London and another suggesting that England spinner Moeen Ali should ask random Muslims if they are terrorists. 
“I apologise deeply to anyone that I’ve offended with those tweets,” Vaughan said. “Times have moved on and I regret those tweets. We all make mistakes and in my life I’ve made quite a few mistakes on Twitter. I apologise for that.” 
Vaughan has been defended by former England spinner Monty Panesar. 
Panesar, the first Sikh to represent England, played international cricket under Vaughan and he insisted he had never known any prejudice from his former skipper. 
“I only experienced positive things with him,” he said on Friday. “I cannot reconcile the man I know with the one who has been the subject of these allegations.”

6,Patel’s five-wicket haul gives India handy lead over New Zealand,"“This is the kind of pitch where you can’t expect wickets all the time,"" he says.","KANPUR: Left-arm spinner Axar Patel claimed figures of 5-62 to help India grab a handy 49-run first-innings lead in the opening test against New Zealand on Saturday. 
The home side suffered a setback, however, with Shubman Gill’s late dismissal as they finished day three on 14-1 at Kanpur’s Green Park Stadium. 
Kyle Jamieson bowled Gill for one and troubled Cheteshwar Pujara who remained unbeaten on nine. 
Opener Mayank Agarwal was on four not out with India 63 ahead in the first match of the two-Test series. 
“This is the kind of pitch where you can’t expect wickets all the time,” Patel said after registering his fifth five-wicket haul in seven innings. 
“You have to be consistent with your line and length. The odd ball turned and occasionally it kept low. I think the wicket will slow down further.” 
Earlier, after inducing several edges that fell agonisingly short of fielders, Ravichandran Ashwin ended India’s 66-over wait for a first wicket by ending a 151-run opening stand between Tom Latham and Will Young. 
Young, having made a career-best 89, edged Ashwin and substitute wicketkeeper KS Bharat — replacing Wriddhiman Saha who was being treated for a stiff neck — grabbed a low catch. 
Young was initially ruled not out, but India reviewed that decision, which had to be overturned after replays confirmed the edge. 
The 29-year-old told journalists after play that batsmen have to use the conditions to “take calculated risks to keep the scoreboard ticking over”. 
“I think each one has their own method of how they’re going to combat the conditions and also the Indian bowlers who are highly skilled in these conditions,” Young said. 
Replying to India’s first-innings total of 345, New Zealand were cruising at 197-1 in the morning session with Latham approaching his hundred and skipper Kane Williamson in the middle. 
Soon after India took the second new ball, however, seamer Umesh Yadav trapped Williamson lbw on the stroke of lunch. 
Williamson, who made 18, reviewed the decision, but replays confirmed the ball would have hit the top of his middle stump. 
Patel ran through the New Zealand middle order removing Ross Taylor and Henry Nicholls and denying Latham his century. 
Latham made 95 before stepping out against Patel, only to be stumped after a fine knock that included 10 fours. 
Ravindra Jadeja dismissed debutant Rachin Ravindra and Ashwin (3-82) claimed the last two wickets as New Zealand were bowled out for 296.

The result left Lens fourth on 25 points from 15 games, 12 behind runaway leaders Paris St Germain, while Angers stayed sixth on 22 points.
Angers always looked more likely to break the deadlock in a cagey first half and Sofiane Boufal gave them a 40th-minute lead when he bundled the ball in past home goalkeeper Jean-Louis Leca after he was put through by Azzedine Ounahi.
Falling behind spurred Lens into action and they turned the tide inside the opening 10 minutes of the second half, with Gael Kakuta levelling when he rifled in a bouncing volley from 10 metres after good work by Massadio Haidara.
Florian Sotoca made it 2-1 to Lens with a superb reflex as he turned in a Przemyslaw Frankowski cross from the left at the near post, but the 31-year old striker then missed a sitter which proved costly.
Sotoca headed wide from close range with the goal at his mercy in the 69th minute and Lens were punished two minutes later as Thomas glanced in a header at the far post after Angelo Fulgini chipped the ball into the right back’s stride.
Angers keeper Danijel Petkovic denied the hosts a stoppage-time winner as he kept out Sekou Fofana’s effort, giving the visitors a well-deserved point.

Djokovic beat Dennis Novak 6-3, 6-2 to give Serbia a 2-0 lead over host Austria in Innsbruck after Dusan Lajovic had defeated Gerald Melzer 7-6 (7-5), 3-6, 7-5 to open the best-of-three series in Group ‘F’. 
The victory extended Djokovic’s winning streak in Davis Cup singles matches to 15. 
“It feels great to play for Serbia again,” said Djokovic, who helped his country win the Davis Cup in 2010 but more recently failed to win a medal in either singles or mixed doubles at the Tokyo Olympics. “It’s been a long year but you always find motivation playing for your country.”  
Nikola Cacic and Filip Krajinovic made it a clean sweep for Serbia with a 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-3 win over Oliver Marach and Philipp Oswald. 
In Madrid, Lopez and Pablo Carreno Busta helped holders Spain to an insurmountable 2-0 lead over debutants Ecuador. 
Veteran Lopez breezed past Roberto Quiroz 6-3, 6-3 before Carreno Busta fought back from a set down to beat Emilio Gomez 5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) and secure victory for Spain. 
Carreno Busta then returned for doubles action with Marcel Granollers and the Spanish duo earned a 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (7-2) win over Gonzalo Escobar and Diego Hidalgo.
Backed by a hearty home crowd, Italy raced into a 2-0 lead over the States thanks to wins from Lorenzo Sonego and Jannik Sinner in Turin. 
Sonego, the world No.27, was ecstatic. “I played the best tennis of my life,” he claimed after seeing off Reilly Opelka 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). 
Sinner then pulverised a static John Isner 6-2, 6-0 in 62 minutes. 
In the doubles rubber Rajeev Ram and Jack Sock struck back for the States in a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 win over Simone Bolleli and Fabio Fognini to make it 2-1, while Colombia are the third team in Group ‘E’. 
On the opening day of the revamped 2021 finals brothers Elias and Mikael Ymer helped Sweden sweep aside Canada, France fought back to down the Czech Republic and Croatia crushed Australia. 
The Davis Cup, which began life back in 1900 as a bilateral contest between Britain and the United States, was cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic. 
This year’s competition sees 12 qualifiers — Australia, Austria, Colombia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Ecuador, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Kazakhstan, Sweden and USA — joined by the previous edition’s semi-finalists — Spain, Canada, Great Britain and the Russian Tennis Federation. 
These are joined by two wild card nations France and Serbia. 
These 18 nations are divided into six groups of three, with winners and the top pair of second places going into the quarter-finals pot. 
The semi-finals and December 5 final will all be played in the Spanish capital, reward for the team that won the title two years ago after 2020 was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

Goals from Borna Sosa and Hiroki Ito earned Stuttgart their first win in seven games across all competitions and their first in the Bundesliga since Oct 2.
The 23-year-old Silas hadn’t played since suffering a cruciate ligament injury against Bayern Munich last season on March 20. He’d scored 11 goals and set up five more in the 24 leagues games before that one.
Ito broke the deadlock against Mainz with a fine strike inside the far post in the 21st minute, set up by Orel Mangala. 
The home team had a penalty awarded shortly afterwards but the decision was reversed after a VAR review.
Alexander Hack equalised with a header from a corner in the 39th, but Sosa scored what proved to be the winner in the 51st by firing inside the near post from Mangala’s layoff. 
Silas looked lively after coming on to a rousing reception from the home fans in the 85th and will be looking forward to the next game at home to Hertha Berlin next weekend.
Stuttgart climbed out of the relegation playoff place and up to 13th ahead of the rest of the 12th round.

Little-known Minhaj Maqsood had been top of the pile in the opening two rounds at the DHA Golf Club but in the third, Pakistan’s top golfer Shabbir Iqbal came to the fore.
Shabbir struck seven birdies in a five-under 67 to move to a total of 10-under 206 for a one-stroke lead over Minhaj who could only manage a 72.
Three strokes further adrift were Shabbir’s historic rivals Matloob Ahmed (71) and Waheed Baloch (69) while Mohammad Shahzad’s 68 took him to 211.
Three golfers are at 212 including Mohammad Naeem, Mohammad Nazir and Shahid Javed Khan who all matched Shabbir in carding a 67 in the third round.
Another three golfers are a stroke behind: Akber Mehroz (68), Mohammad Imran (70), and Mohammad Zubair (71).
Khalid Khan fired the day’s best of 66 but is on 214 alongside four other golfers including Pakistan’s rising golf star Ahmed Baig (72).
Another of Shabbir’s long-time rivals, Mohammad Munir is seemingly out of contention after his 72 saw him finish the third round 11 strokes behind the leader.

Granada rallied to take the lead after Darwin Machis made it 1-1 in the 25th with a shot that went in off the post. Jorge Molina then swept in a poorly defended shot by Machis that hit two defenders before reaching the striker to send the visitors into halftime with the lead.
After almost equalising with a long shot that hit the crossbar, Garcia’s headed pass to Inaki Williams started a team move that ended in a 76th-minute own goal by Granada goalkeeper Luis Maximiano. Williams’ shot was saved off the line, only for Muniain to finish it off with a ball that ricocheted off the post and Maximiano before going in.
Bilbao remained winless in five rounds but stayed in eighth place. Granada moved into 14th place, three points from the relegation zone.

“[Prime Minister] Imran should realise that due to departmental cricket many players [in Pakistan] were earning their livelihood in a respectful manner,” said Zaheer, who played international and departmental cricket alongside Imran Khan during their playing days.
“Imran has to do something outstanding for promoting cricket in Pakistan to be remembered for many years,” Zaheer, 74, emphasised.
Commenting on the current Pakistan team, Zaheer said Babar Azam was doing well with the bat and Pakistan’s performance was also comparatively better.
“Though the [other] batsmen are also performing well but hiring a [full-time] batting coach would be the team management’s decision,” he said.
