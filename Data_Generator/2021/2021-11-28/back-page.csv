0,PIA announces schedule of 35 weekly flights to Saudi Arabia,"Flights to be operated to Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam and Al-Qasim.","RAWALPINDI: After Saudi Arabia’s decision to allow direct flights from Pakistan starting from Dec 1, the Pakistan International Airlines has announced its flight schedule to operate 35 flights weekly to the kingdom. 
The Saudi authorities on Thursday decided to withdraw a ban on flights from six countries — Pakistan, India, Indonesia, Egypt, Brazil and Vietnam — and passengers from these countries will no longer be required to undergo a 14-day quarantine in a third country. 
A spokesman for PIA said that the administration has begun expanding air operation to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with operating 35 flights weekly from Pakistan’s different destinations. 

Flights to be operated to Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam and Al-Qasim

He said the flights will be operated to Saudi Arabia’s cities of Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam and Al-Qasim. 
The PIA flights will depart from different cities of Pakistan — Islamabad, Karachi, Multan, Lahore and Peshawar — he added. 
Earlier, some flights of the national airline in some categories were operating even before this new flight schedule. Passengers departing from December 1 must comply with the five-day quarantine requirement according to Saudi law, said the PIA spokesman. 
He added that the decision to increase the number of flights will be taken after the demand increases. 
Since the travel restrictions were relaxed by the Saudi government, a large number of people intending to travel to Saudi Arabia have been contacting the airline offices for tickets. 
The General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) of Saudi Arabia had issued a notification to all airlines operating in the kingdom’s airports on November 25 allowing direct entry to the kingdom from the Republic of Indonesia, Islamic Republic of Pakistan, Federal Republic of Brazil, Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Arab Republic of Egypt and India without the need to stay 14 days outside these countries before entering the kingdom. 
“Institutional quarantine procedures must be applied for a period of 05 days, regardless of passengers’ immunisation status outside the kingdom, with the continued application of exceptions issued regarding some groups in this regard.”

1,Dutch isolate South Africa cases as world confronts new virus variant,"Australia and Thailand have joined the US, Brazil, Canada and others in restricting travel from southern Africa.","SCHIPHOL: Dutch autho­rities scrambled on Satur­day to see if 61 passengers from South Africa who tested positive for Covid-19 have the Omicron strain, as shutters came down around the world to contain the new variant. 
Germany became the second European country to find a suspected case of the highly infectious new variant, which has sparked fears of a major setback in the global effort to end the coronavirus pandemic. 
Alarm grew after the World Health Organisation said the new type, originally known as B.1.1.529 and subsequently renamed Omi­cron, was a “variant of concern” and more transmissible than the dominant Delta strain. 
Australia and Thailand joined the United States, Brazil, Canada and a host of other countries around the world restricting travel from southern Africa where the strain was first discovered. 
Anxious travellers thron­ged Johannesburg international airport, desperate to squeeze onto the last flights to countries that had imp­osed sudden travel bans. Many had cut back holidays and rushed back from South African safaris and vineyards. 
“It’s ridiculous, we will always be having new variants,” British tourist David Good said, passports in hand.  “South Africa found it but it’s probably all over the world already.”  
“I think we got the last two seats,” said Briton Toby Reid, 24, who had been watching the sunrise on Cape Town’s Table Mountain with his girlfriend when the ban was announced. 
The main countries targe­ted by the shutdown inc­lude South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini (Swaziland), Lesotho, Namibia, Zambia, Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. 
But in a sign of the how difficult it is to contain the virus, the Netherlands found that almost one in ten — 61 out of 539 — people who had arrived on Friday from South Africa were positive for Covid-19. 
The infected people, who flew in on two KLM flights from Johannesburg, were being kept quarantined in a hotel near Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, one of Europe’s biggest international air hubs. 
“The positive test results will be examined as soon as possible to determine whether this concerns the new worrisome variant,” the Dutch Health Authority said in a statement. 
Europe is already struggling with a coronavirus surge that has forced several countries including the Nether­lands to tighten restrictions, and a new variant threatens to worsen the situation. 
A German official said that health authorities have identified the first suspected case in the country, in a person who returned from South Africa.

2,IHC seeks report on govt steps to protect journalists’ rights,"There is no effective legislation for protecting the rights of media workers and journalists, petitioner says.","ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has sought a report from the information ministry on the measures the government has taken to safeguard the rights of journalists and media persons. 
IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah heard a petition filed by a faction of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists. The journalists’ body has invoked the jurisdiction of the IHC under Article 199 of the Constitution. 
Advocate Umer Ijaz Gillani, representing the petitioner, contended that security of media workers and journalists has a direct nexus with protecting fundamental rights of people guaranteed under Articles 9, 19 and 19-A of the Constitution. 
He argued that the Implementation Tribunal for Newspaper Employees (ITNE) has not been constituted and more than 40,000 cases are pending in it. He contended that there is no effective legislation on protection of the rights of media workers and journalists.  

40,000 cases are pending in ITNE, court told

Justice Minallah observed: “The questions raised are in the context of an independent free press and media. Article 19-A guarantees that every citizen shall have the right to have access to information in all matters of public importance. 
“The independence of an editor, opinion writer and reporter is of crucial importance. Their independence and noninterference in editorial policies are relatable to the regulation of the proprietorship of the media and press.”  
The questions are, therefore, of paramount importance and it is important to understand and comprehend the international best practices and principles employed to ensure the access of citizens to information and for an independent and free media and press to play its role as contemplated under Article 19-A of the Constitution, the chief justice observed. 
The court directed the registrar office to issue notices to the information ministry and the ITNE for filing reports and para-wise comments within a fortnight. 
The ITNE registrar was directed to submit a report on the current status of the pending complaints. The information ministry was directed to highlight the measures taken by the government to protect the rights of media workers and journalists. 
The court also appointed senior journalists Mazhar Abbas and Hamid Mir and the presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Islamabad High Court Journalists Association as amici curiae. 
On the next date of hearing, the counsel for the petitioner and the amici curiae are expected to assist the IHC whether it would not be beneficial for adjudication of the questions raised in the petition to seek an amicus brief from the United Nations Human Rights Commission.

3,Amendments to elections laws challenged in apex court,"The amendments were never put to any debate and were simply bulldozed, petitioner says.","ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has been asked to declare void and of no legal affect recent amendments to the elections laws that allow the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in general elections. 
“The wholesale amendments were never put to any debate and were simply bulldozed into the Election Laws, to enable the most suspected massive rigging of the general election, including other elections conducted by the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC),” pleads a petition filed by a concerned citizen, Saleemullah Khan, in person. 
On November 17, a joint session of the parliament passed a record 33 bills in a single day, including the controversial bill on the use of EVMs in elections, the petition says, adding that the amendment is against the spirit of the Constitu­tion and the law the amendment has replaced. 
The petition argues that the law makes a distinction between an amendment and an entire substitution, and that the substitutions made are an act of doing away with the original provisions pertaining to elections to be held, in future, in Pakistan. 
The amendment has been made with mala fide intent and in contravention of the Constitution and is bound to open the floodgate of election rigging, the petition fears, adding that the amendment would ultimately create confusion in the country. 
It says that computer literacy in Pakistan is so low that the use of EVMs in polls is bound to let loose an avalanche of mistakes on the part of illiterate and partially literate voters, which would only benefit the ruling party, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf that has grown highly unpopular. 
The amendment does away with the initial pilot projects, which were envisaged in the pre-amendment law, even otherwise, the amendment is “practically impossible”, it says. 
Moreover, the cost of EVMs is much higher than its benefits, if any, and it entails huge concomitant cost and ills and risks, the petition says. The amendment is confusing and raises many pertinent questions relating to its implementation, it says. 
Moreover, the authority of chief election commissioner (CEC) has been reduced, curtailed and abridged through the amendment, in contravention of the Constitution, the petition fears. It says that the objections raised by the Election Commission of Pakistan have been ignored and trampled over. 
Besides, different opposition parties were never taken on board while passing the law, the petition says, adding that the amendment to Section-94 of the election act is strangely silent as to how overseas Pakistanis would exercise their vote from their countries of residence. 
The government in the joint session of the parliament was in such an ugly haste in its act of bulldozing the election amendments that the mistakes of English language stand out like a sore thumb in the amendment in Section-103, the petition says. 
The National Database and Registra­tion Authority has been made to usurp upon the jurisdiction, authority and independence of the CEC, which the Constitution does not permit, it adds.
