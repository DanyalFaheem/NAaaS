0,"Amenity plots can’t be allotted for commercial, residential purposes: SC",Housing ministry has no power to change original land use status.,"\KARACHI: While expressing surprise over city’s housing societies working under federal organisations for misusing public spaces, the Supreme Court has observed that the land meant for amenity purposes cannot be allotted for commercial and residential purposes.
It directed the ministry of housing and works to file a comprehensive report in this regard.
A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed ordered that no marriage function and parking of vehicles would be allowed on two plots apparently meant for amenity purposes in the Karachi Cooperative Housing Society (KCHS).
The bench also restrained all parties not to create a third-party interest in a multi-storey building reportedly built on parkland in Bahadur Yar Jang Cooperative Housing Society till further order.
The CJP also came down hard on the president of the Pakistan Employees Cooperative Housing Society (PECHS) during hearing of a matter about allotment of green belt to K-Electric for setting up a grid station and warned that he could be sent to prison for leasing out public spaces to private persons.
The court observed that the PECHS administration had also leased out the land of Kidney Hill Park for residential and commercial purposes.

Housing ministry has no power to change original land use status

In its written order issued on Saturday about the hearing held on Friday, the apex court directed housing and works secretary Imran Zaib to come up with a comprehensive report about allotment of land meant for park, playgrounds and other amenity purposes to private persons for commercial and residential purposes in such societies.
During the proceedings, the secretary conceded that the ministry had no power or authority to change the original land use in the layout plan of housing societies operating under its domain.
The bench was informed that two plots measuring 11,780 and 11,660 square yards in KCHS on main Tipu Sultan Road were actually meant for amenity purposes, but one of the plots was illegally bifurcated into small plots and some of them allotted to one Junaid Makda, who was reportedly running wedding halls and parking lot on it.
The bench observed that such allotment appeared to have been made by the ministry of housing and works. However, Mr Zaib, present in court, submitted that the ministry did not make any such lease/allotment.
The bench in its order said that apparently both plots were specifically meant for amenity purposes, but incidentally the office-bearers of the society not only mismanaged the amenity plots but also tried to create interests of individual persons through a factious Al-Riaz Cooperative Society.
It further noted that the original layout plan appeared to be tampered with by the officer-bearers of the society, which was illegal as a layout plan once prepared and amenities were provided, such amenities cannot be removed or altered/converted into private buildings for commercial use.
The bench observed that the matter required further clarification as the housing and works secretary stated that he would place on record complete details of such plots and also took stand that the ministry had no authority to change original land use in the layout plan.
The lawyer for the society submitted that both the plots were meant of amenity purposes and all purported allotments and leases may be cancelled. The bench allowed the secretary to file a report in a month and also granted similar time to Mr Makda to file documents.
However, it ordered the officer-bearers of the society to ensure that no marriage functions and parking spaces would take place on such plots.
The bench was further informed that a plot measuring 3,931 square yards and meant for a family park in Bahadur Yar Jang Cooperative Housing Society had been bifurcated into three plots and only a small portion of the plot was left for the park. The other two plots had been allotted and a huge building known as Al-Bari Towers built on one such plot, it added.
Senior lawyer Rasheed A. Razvi appeared on the behalf of builder of Al-Bari Towers and requested for time to file a concise statement upon which the bench allowed him one-month time.

1,PMA wants strict Covid screening at airports,"""The govt must take immediate measures to prevent the new variant from entering into the country,"" says PMA official.","KARACHI: Expressing concern over the threat posed by the new Covid-19 variant, ‘Omicron’, that has attracted serious worldwide concern, the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) on Saturday called upon the government to temporarily suspend travel from South Africa, which has reported this variant, and other countries of the region.
“It’s a wake-up call. The government must take immediate measures to prevent this variant from entering into the country and impose a temporary ban on air travel from South Africa and other countries of this region,” said PMA secretary general Dr Qaiser Sajjad.
On behalf of the association, he suggested that the government improve Covid-19 surveillance facilities at airports and other entry points of the country, especially for passengers arriving from high-risk countries.
“If anybody is found with symptoms of Covid-19, the person should be quarantined at entry points whereas passengers testing positive for coronavirus should be kept in isolation facilities,” he emphasised.
He feared that the government failure in taking immediate action might lead to another Covid-19 wave in the country.
“It could be serious because this new variant is more contagious. We should be very careful to avoid any untoward situation. We ask people to get vaccinated. Wear masks properly whenever they go out, improve ventilation in indoor spaces, avoid crowded places, ensure physical distancing and hand hygiene,” he said.

2,Situationer: New bill tightens Sindh govt’s control over local bodies,PPP govt takes away many functions mentioned in LG law of 2013...,"THE new Local Government (Amend­ment) Bill, 2021, that the Sindh Assembly passed with majority vote a day before gives total control to the provincial government over municipal organisations so much so that it can effectively pull back their reins with just a notification without going through the cumbersome process of legislation. 
Through Section 16 of the amended bill, the Sindh government added Section 140-A (Power of government to amend schedules) in the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013, that reads: “Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, the government shall have powers to amend, alter, add or remove any entries from the Schedules, by notification in the official gazette.” 
While LG Minister Nasir Shah had claimed to have ‘empowered’ the municipal organisations under the new legislation, practically his government took away the many functions mentioned in the LG law of 2013 but also ensured that the elected mayor of Karachi would remain at its mercy as far as his / her role in the affairs of water and sewerage, solid waste management, building control, master plan, food control is concerned. 
After the passage of the bill on Friday, the LG minister had told reporters that the elected mayor would be given “a role” in the organisations currently tasked with solid waste management, building control, water board, etc. However, the amended bill is silent about such a role. 

PPP govt takes away many functions mentioned in LG law of 2013

An opposition lawmaker aptly put it as centralisation / provincialisation of powers instead of devolution of powers at the grassroots level. 
Restoration of town system
The one good thing in the new seven-page document is restoration of town system and abolishment of district municipal corporations. 
Towns were first introduced in the Sindh Local Government Ordinance, 2001, during the era of former military dictator Gen Pervez Musharraf.  
Under that system, a city district government replaced the old Karachi Metropolitan Corporation and 18 towns replaced five district municipal committees. The system was wrapped up by the Pakistan Peoples Party government around a decade before reviving the KMC and DMCs. 
Currently, Karachi is divided into seven DMCs — South, West, East, Central, Malir, Korangi and Keamari — and after the bill becomes law these DMCs would stand abolished and town metropolitan corporation will take their place. 
As per the population limit — 500,000 to 750,000 — Karachi may get between 20 and 25 towns since its population stands at 16 million in the controversial Census 2017. However, the new legislation is also silent about the number of the expected towns. 
In the amended bill of 2021, the minimum limit of population for a metropolitan corporation was enhanced to 5m from 3.5m in the SLGA 2013.  
Likewise, a municipal corporation’s population would be in between 300,000 to 750,000 from previous 300,000 to 3.5m; the population of a union committee in a metropolitan corporation should be 45,000 to 75,000 while the population of a union council (rural areas) mentioned in the new legislation is between 10,000 and 25,000. 
The new bill also takes back health-related functions as well as operations of hospitals and a medical and dental college from the only metropolitan corporation of the province as mentioned in Schedule-II Part-I (5).  
The said clauses of the LG law of 2013 say: “Medical College and Teaching/Specialised Hospitals e.g. Karachi Medical and Dental College, Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, Sobhraj Maternity Home, Sarfaraz Shaheed Hospital, Spencer’s Eye Hospital, Leprosy Hospital and such other institutions as were being managed by City District Government Karachi or Karachi Metropolitan Corporation or as may be specified by Government before commencement of this Act.” 
No direct election for mayor
In the new legislation, the chairmen, vice chairmen and councillors of union committees in urban areas and union councils in rural areas would be directly elected through people’s vote.  
While Prime Minister Imran Khan had time and again advocated the direct election for the office of mayor of big cities, the amended legislation in Sindh says mayors would be elected indirectly as UC chairmen of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation would elect mayor and deputy mayor.  
According to the SLGA 2013, one has to be chairman of a union committee in the jurisdiction of a metropolitan corporation to contest the mayoral election to be held via ‘show of hands’. But, in the new legislation, any person can contest the mayoral election for which the procedure has been changed via an amendment to ‘secret ballot’.  
Sindh Information Minister Saeed Ghani had defended the indirect election for mayor, saying it was not possible for a candidate to cover such a big city like Karachi having 21 National Assembly constituencies. “Those giving this proposal should tell as to why they are not in favour of direct election of prime minister and chief minister,” he asked. 
“There is a dire need of a new local government system for which an entirely new legislation is required as amendments in the 2013 LG law won’t work,” says a former government official. “I know there are people in the PPP who wanted a better and effective system to run Karachi, but their proposals were given a cold shoulder.”

He also vowed that the PSP would challenge the PPP moves at every legal and democratic forum and would not allow the ruling party easy sailing.
“The PPP-led provincial government in Sindh is a democratic terrorist and Karachi is the worst victims of the PPP’s democratic terrorism,” he said while talking to reporters after leading a protest rally from Hasan Square to Federal Urdu University against the ‘bad’ governance of the PPP.
A number of people including women and children participated in the rally.
Carrying placards and chanting slogans against the Sindh government, they demanded the authorities for restoration of Karachi rights and empower the local government system.
“The way corruption is growing in the city is the extreme of misconduct. Files are being signed without building roads and all the money is being spent on corruption. The people of Karachi would prefer to die together while standing firm against the oppressors instead of dying one by one.”

4,"Do we wind up our businesses in Karachi, ask builders","""We get orders for bulldozing Nasla Tower but we never do anything about Bahria Town,"" says Abad chairman Mohsin Sheikhani.","KARACHI: The builders and realtors operating in Karachi on Saturday called for immediate action plan from the authorities so they could do their business in line with defined laws otherwise, they warned, the situation emerged after the  demolition of Nasla Towers under the Supreme Court orders could lead to suspension of all commercial activities in Karachi.  
Addressing a press conference near Nasla Tower with fellow builders and allottees of the building, Association of Builders and Developers (Abad) chairman Mohsin Sheikhani wondered over the double standards being devised by institutions for one illegality and referred to some 700 buildings being still raised in Karachi without facing any warning or action from the government machinery. 
The protesting builders and residents were also joined by politicians who came there to express solidarity with them.
He also appealed the key business bodies of the country including, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry to join hands with builders for a final business strategy in Karachi.  
“We should decide together whether we could do any business in this city or not,” he said.  
“This city generates revenue for the whole country. This is a business capital of Pakistan, but here we are treated as criminals. We get orders for bulldozing Nasla Tower but we never do anything about Bahria Town spread over 16,000 acres without any approval or regularisation. We are told about regularisation of Banigala. Why the law is different for different people?” 
He reiterated that Abad had stopped work on all ongoing projects in Karachi in protest against uncertainty over the future of housing schemes as everyone was afraid that their buildings could be demolished in the future.  
“We get approval of a single project from 17 different agencies,” he said. “Now I beg you to please tell us that from how many more agencies we need to get permission [for a project] so that there is no action against builders in the future. If you can’t run a transparent system then hand it over this regulation to DHA or even the Supreme Court may take it up. We can’t afford this uncertainty and fear like situation.” 
In Hyderabad, Sindh Information Minister Saeed Ghani called for looking at the issues like Nasla Tower demolition from human angle saying a commission headed by a Supreme Court judge may be appointed to come up with findings on these human settlements and future guidelines.
He said this while speaking at a programme of the Hyderabad Union of Journalists (HUJ) at the local press club.
Mr Ghani said the Punjab government had formed a commission to regularize 6,000 illegal societies. Proposing a judicial body, he said: “Such commission see whether we have to bomb settlements, displace them, penalize them.”
He said this commission must suggest ways to avoid such irregularities in future.

5,The Rumi-Iqbal matrix discussed,KARACHI: A session titled ‘Ruminations to explore the Rumi-Iqbal Matrix’ was held on Friday in which...,"KARACHI: A session titled ‘Ruminations to explore the Rumi-Iqbal Matrix’ was held on Friday in which distinguished playwright Zafar Mairaj delivered a talk.
The event was organised by the English Programme and Literary Society of the DHA Suffa University.
Mr Mairaj said he was introduced to Allama Iqbal and Rumi when he was a child and his maternal grandfather’s eyesight was getting weak. Since they spoke Persian around the house, it was his duty as a young boy that every morning he get to read Rumi and Iqbal’s poems to the grandfather because he could not see well. With the passage of time, all that poetry and the discussions on it enabled him to get a position in society because of which now he’s asked to speak on the two poets [though he modestly submitted that he wasn’t an scholar of the subject]. 
Mr Mairaj said before Rumi and Iqbal there was a personality called Shams Tabriz. “Who was Rumi [before he met Tabriz]?” He was a maulana who had wealth of knowledge because he’d read a lot. Then something transformed Rumi. 
In that connection the writer told a story. Once the maulana was sitting along the bank of a river; he had books by his side. A faqir [Tabriz] came and asked what was in the books, to which he replied that “you don’t know what’s in them”. The faqir picked up the books and threw them in the river. When the maulana protested, the faqir put his hand in the river, brought the books back, and they weren’t wet. When the maulana asked what that was about, the faqir answered, “This is something that you don’t know about. This can’t be learnt from books. This is inside of you.” From that point Rumi changed; he took off the turban of knowledge full of arrogance and embarked on a new journey — the journey within. 
Mr Mairaj argued that when a poet has a convoluted (uljha hua) mind he writes using a difficult language. When there’s clarity in his mind, his language becomes simple. In the beginning honeybees, ants and rabbits were Rumi’s metaphors and symbols. Then he drew his attention to human beings (insan). 
On Rumi’s poetry he said that the poet’s famous masnavi begins with: 
Bishnu az ney chun hikayat mi kunad
Az judai ha shikayat mi kunad 
[Listen to the reed flute
It’s song of separation] 
Mr Mairaj claimed the sound of ‘ney’ covers all of his poetry well. 
Shifting to the other half of the talk, he said the 13th century, when Rumi was born, was a stable time period. But when Iqbal (19th century) saw the light of day, it was a turbulent period, not just for the subcontinent but for Central Asia — it was a period of movements, especially with reference to Muslims. Iqbal, too, wrote about human beings, but wherever he saw man [of a certain region] in a troubled state he turned that state into a poem. Be they Muslims of the subcontinent or Russian Marxists, be they those who suffered at the hands of Mussolini’s fascism or those living in Balochistan at the time… [Iqbal wrote for all of them]. The playwright backed up his argument by referring to Iqbal’s poem in which a Baloch old man is giving instructions to his son, calling it “motivational”. If Muslims in his poetry are seen suffering from zabun haali (bad state) then they’re seen as human beings, he pointed out. 
In the end, Mr Mairaj concluded that Rumi worked on humans while Iqbal on humanity (Rumi ne insan pe kaam kiya aur Iqbal ne insaniyat pe).
Earlier, Prof Dr Bashir Ahmad, dean management and social sciences, informed the attendees, which largely comprised the university’s students, about the importance of literature and gave a brief comparison of Iqbal and Rumi. 
Dr Sarah Syed Kazmi moderated the event.

Sixty-one girls and 20 boys received top positions at the event whereas 18 students received doctorate degrees.
A total of 916 and 868 students received graduation and masters’ degrees, respectively.
The ceremony was divided into two parts; the morning session was presided over by the varsity Chancellor, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail, and the evening session by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah.
Congratulating the students, the governor said absolute sincerity and dedication could help achieve anything in life. “Your future is Pakistan’s future. Don’t limit yourself to academic excellence alone. Dream big and think how you can uplift your nation, your people.”
The government, he said, was making every effort to facilitate the youth. “The Prime Minister’s Kamyab Jawan Programme is one such initiative that aims at providing financial support to youth for starting businesses. Don’t look for jobs, create them and become a tool to assist others.”
Appreciating the faculty and the university administration, the chancellor said he was impressed by the progress made at the university and its Thar campus.
In his speech, Vice Chancellor Prof Sarosh Hashmat Lodi recalled how everybody played its part during the pandemic, which claimed many precious lives and hoped that the situation would further improve.
Talking about the university’s progress over the past 100 years, Prof Lodi said the institution was initially established as an engineering college so as to produce engineers who were required for construction of Sukkur Barrage.
“Since then, NED has produced thousands of engineers, and now professionals in many other disciplines. The alumni of this institution are not only contributing within Pakistan but also serving in various key positions all around the world including North America, Europe and Australia,” he noted, adding that the university was the first engineering institution in the country to award 18 PhD degrees.
On university’s services during the pandemic, the vice chancellor shared that it played a very important role in combating Covid 19 challenges.
“The indigenous development of the ventilator prototype is a case in point. Once commercially produced, this assemblage will become an affordable life-saving alternative in our healthcare facilities. Input to epidemiological projections of the pandemic is another worth noting service. It has helped the concerned public departments to better position the policy and action response to emanating Covid 19 challenges,” he informed the audience.
To students, he said they must never settle for anything less than excellence and “never lose heart. Success always embraces those who know how to rise after a fall”.

7,An evening of art immersion and tech experience,Governor Ismail appreciates modern art through technology.,"KARACHI: The curtain-raiser of the third Karachi Biennale, KB22 ‘Collective Imagination: Now and the Next’, organised by the Consul General of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Trustees of the Karachi Biennale Trust, turned out to be an evening of art immersion and tech experience. 
Keeping to the theme of art and tech and hybrid art, the guests at the residence of the German consul general on Friday evening were introduced to augmented reality in the form of the installation of Hermes’ Tears, an exhibition of three paintings by the German artist Dennis Rudolph. The conceptual artist from Berlin is known to work primarily with augmented reality, virtual reality, performance and paintings. 
The guests were provided a QR code to scan or download an application from the Apple/Play Store in order to be able to interact with the exhibited art while turning up their phone volumes to maximum.

They were also required to scan the three small paintings on display as they were details of much larger figures painted in virtual reality. There were lots of ‘ohhs’, ‘ahas’ and ‘wows’ coming from everywhere as after doing the needful the paintings appeared in 3D as seen on the screen of people’s phones and tablets to the tunes of Richard Wagner’s three-act opera Prelude to Lohergrin. It truly felt like one had entered the paintings. 

Governor Ismail appreciates modern art through technology

The chief guest on the occasion, the Governor of Sindh, Imran Ismail, also appreciated the modern art through technology as he was pulled into the paintings virtually by the artist himself from his tablet. 
Speaking about the relevance of his work in Karachi, artist Dennis Rudolph said that he had never been in the city with a population of over 20 million people, and he was excited to share his kind of art with them. “There is so much diversity here and I am glad to find that everyone has a smartphone in which they are downloading my app to enjoy the illusion,” he said. 
Glad to see a huge turnout at his residence for the curtain-raiser post Covid-19, the Consul General of Germany, Holger Ziegeler, said that Pakistan and Germany are two countries that are more than 5,000km apart and yet they have come together. “We have built a bridge of cultural exchange, not iron and steel,” he said. 
The curator of KB22, Faisal Anwar, said that the third Karachi Biennale offers connoisseurs of art to find new ways of looking at the past, present and future of art.

“The Biennale will present projects and practices that visualise new connections between the real, the physical and the virtual world,” he said. “We believe in cultural diplomacy. This year we marked 70 years of diplomatic relations with Pakistan. Besides our political and economic relations, the German contribution to cultural preservation is visible in heritage sites such as Mohenjo Daro and Makli necropolis and our study of the poetry and philosophy of Allama Iqbal,” he said.
One of the founders of the Karachi Biennale, Niilofur Farrukh, said they are going to bridge conventional art with technology this year. “Through the Karachi Biennale, we are taking art to the public,” she said. 
Finally, the Karachi Biennale Trust Patron Rabiya Javeri Agha summed it all up when she said: “Earth without art is just ‘eh’!”
Artist and art educator Munawar Ali Syed, creative technologist Jahanzeb Khawaja, trustee Seema Jaffer also spoke.

8,JI to challenge new LG law in court,KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami on Saturday said that it would challenge the Local Government Amendment Bill 2021 of ...,"KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami on Saturday said that it would challenge the Local Government Amendment Bill 2021 of the Pakistan Peoples Party government, which it got passed by the Sindh Assembly on Friday. 
The JI called the passage of the bill a dictatorial move from the ruling PPP which had made every attempt to paralysed the local government system in the province through legislation and grab all power, resources and funds. 
Addressing a press conference along with its lone MPA in the Sindh Assembly Syed Abdul Rasheed and JI deputy chief Dr Osama Razzi at Idara Noor-i-Haq, JI Karachi chief Hafiz Naeem ur Rahman said that the PPP government had crushed all legal requirements, democratic norms and parliamentary traditions while passing the bill in haste, which was never discussed in house and rejected by the opposition unanimously. 
“And they [PPP leaders] lecture us about democracy and rule of law,” he said. 
“What the PPP has done is that it has tried to legalise all illegal things by using the Sindh Assembly to make this torn and bruised draft a law. They have even deprived the local government representatives of taking a decision or initiative even for a sewerage or water line in their constituency. They have turned all LG members into puppets, who are answerable but don’t enjoy any authority. We reject this bill and we would be challenging it in the apex court.” 
MPA Rasheed shared details as to how the ruling PPP violated the rules of business at the Sindh Assembly, created at an atmosphere of panic just to exclude the opposition members from the process and passed the bill in haste. 
“The [opposition] members were not even provided a copy of the draft bill,” he said. “Then after hue and cry was made, the copy was made available, but in the meantime the process for its approval was started. The PPP has unfortunately has made fun of one of the most respected institutions just for its political gains and vested interests. You would hear their leaders lecturing about democracy, values, human rights and norms. But when you see them as ruling party, you would find feudal in each one of them. They are not only corrupt, but also oppressors.” 
He said the PPP was well aware of the fact that it could not win hearts of people in urban areas of Sindh like in rural parts where it used its feudal forces and authority to keep people suppressed. 
For control of urban centres, he said, the PPP had decided to devise powerless local bodies’ system which would always remain under its thumb.

11,Father demands judicial inquiry into CMC student’s mysterious death,"DADU: Father of Nosheen Shah, fourth year student of MBBS who was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her hostel ...","DADU: Father of Nosheen Shah, fourth year student of MBBS who was found hanging from a ceiling fan in her hostel room at Chandka Medical College on Wednesday, has said that he has firm belief his daughter has not committed suicide, she has been brutally murdered. 
Dr Syed Hidayatullah Kazmi, the victim’s father, and his brother Syed Fida Hussain Shah said at a press conference at their residence here on Saturday that they had no trust in the fact-finding committee formed by Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Medical University’s vice chancellor Dr Anila Atta Rehman as well as police teams investigating the case.
Dr Kazmi rejected all the probe teams and appealed to Chief Justices of Supreme Court and Sindh High Court to order judicial inquiry into the case to be carried out by the judges of SC and SHC or by SHC Justice Iqbal Kalhoro.
He held the CMC administration responsible for his daughter’s “murder” and demanded the college administration, SMBBMU, the hostel warden, provost, roommates, and other hostellers residing in the rooms adjacent to Nosheen’s should also be made part of the investigation in order to reach the real killers of his daughter.
He said the university administration was only protecting itself by trying to prove the murder as suicide. His daughter was the second student found dead in similar circumstances at the same college but no one was held responsible then, nor now, he said.
He said that for three years her daughter had no complaint against her roommates but as soon as her room was changed by the warden in the fourth year she registered complaints with the hostel administration about her room partner but the officials concerned did not pay heed to her for 12 months. 
Dr Kazmi said that Nosheen had attended marriage ceremony of his sister three days before her death and she looked truly happy. All family members had talked to her even a few hours before her death but she had not spoken of anything that might be troubling her, he said. 
He arrived at the hostel immediately after he was informed about the incident and noticed his daughter’s body was hanging from a ceiling fan but her feet were clearly touching the table underneath, suggesting someone might have killed her before hanging the body, he said, adding where were her roommates, other students in adjacent rooms and the hostel warden when the incident took place. 
Dr Kazmi appealed to people to support his family in their efforts for finding out the actual murderers of his daughter.
Syed Ameer Shah, son of legendary poet Ustad Bukhari and uncle of Dr Nosheen, said at a press conference that the “murder” had caused panic among all girl students who had to reside in hostels at public universities, hence, it was necessary to track down Dr Nosheen’s killers. 
He demanded removal of SMBBMU vice chancellor till completion of the inquiry into Dr Nosheen’s death.
Meanwhile, a large number of citizens and social activists took out a procession in protest against mysterious death of Dr Nosheen and demanded removal of the SMBBMU’s VC.
University registrar proposes judicial inquiry 
LARKANA: The management of SMBBMU has proposed initiating process for judicial inquiry into the mysterious death of Dr Nosheen at her hostel room in the CMC.
The university’s registrar said in a letter dated Nov 26 to the secretary of Universities and Boards Department that the matter might be sent to the district and sessions judge of Larkana for conducting judicial enquiry into the student’s death so that the real and factual cause of death could be known.
He informed the secretary that some elements had created hype over the incident and they were trying to provoke public by creating hatred against the university while threats had also been issued to the university management by some evil minded persons. 
They also talked of alleged reluctance by the hostel management on changing Dr Nosheen’s room despite her repeated requests, he said.
The registrar had also constituted a fact-finding committee but the victim’s family had rejected it. 
Hostel warden removed 
The registrar has meanwhile issued an order to relieve Dr Lubna Adnan, assistant professor of pathology, of her additional charge as deputy to hostel provost with immediate effect. She, however, would continue her primary job as assistant professor, said the order.

The administration of Sindh University, Jamshoro, has finally issued notices to its 30 students studying in various disciplines for allegedly indulging in anti-state slogan mongering while violating the institution’s rules and code of conduct during an event on Nov 18 to celebrate the Sindh culture day on the campus.

Since then an inquiry had been under way. Finally, SU vice chancellor Prof Dr Muhammad Siddique Kalhoro gave his consent to the issuance of notices to the errant students.
It transpired on Friday that  students affairs director Dr Younis Leghari issued notices to 30 students directing them to appear before the university’s discipline committee on Nov 30 in the office of the dean faculty of natural sciences. Each of them have been asked to bring his/her father or guardian to the venue.
The notice read: “It has been observed that they [students] have not followed the guidelines given in the Registrar Office [vide] Circular No. S.U.G/623, dated: 12.11.2021 and created law and order situation which has severely affected the educational environment and peaceful study atmosphere”.
It reminded students of all disciplines that they were asked  to celebrate the day on November 18 within the vicinity of their respective department and avoid taking out rallies and resort to indulging in prohibited acts.

He said that the matter was brought to to the notice of the administration by law enforcement agencies which took a serious notice of the unlawful activities and urged the SU vice-chancellor to take take action against those involved in raising anti-state slogans on the campus.
When contacted, a spokesman for the university said that a group of students had violated the guidelines issued by the registrar’s office. They took out rallies on Nov 18 to celebrate Sindhi culture day and also created a law and order situation on the campus, he added.
Sources in the administration claimed that the VC agreed to issue notices to the errant students and also to rusticate them if recommended by the disciplinary committee.  He pointed out that the routine academic and extracurricular activities had remained suspended for almost two years on account of the Covid-19 pandemic-related restrictions and the situation on the campus had returned to normality only a few months back. 
Therefore, he said, students were allowed to hold events like culture day celebration, farewell to passed out students and welcome reception to newly admitted ones.
However, the cases of those students who challenged the administration’s writ on the campus had now been referred to the disciplinary committee, which would recommend appropriate action against anyone found to be at fault.
