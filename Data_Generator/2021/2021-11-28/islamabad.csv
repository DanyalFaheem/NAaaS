0,Pakistan to reduce another 15pc emissions from own resources: PM’s aide,ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to Prime Minister Malik Amin Aslam on Saturday said Pakistan had promised another 15pc...,"ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to Prime Minister Malik Amin Aslam on Saturday said Pakistan had promised another 15pc reduction in carbon emissions from its own resources. Pakistan had already reduced 20pc of its carbon emissions under the previously submitted National Determined Contribution (NDC)
While speaking at a webinar organised by Devcom-Pakistan, he stressed the need for vigorous implementation mechanisms for the commitments Pakistan had made globally to resist against climate change.
He said some policies and strategic frameworks were launched before going to the 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) of the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change (UNFCCC) hosted by the UK.
“Pakistan’s National Determined Contribution (NDC) to the COP26 was declared as one of the best. We have asked for a $100 billion grant in a decade to reduce 50pc of its carbon emissions. The country has promised 15pc reduction in carbon emissions from its own resources,” he said.
Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) Executive Director Dr Abid Qayyum Suleri said Pakistan’s performance at COP26 had been exemplary for every country participating there. Environmentalist Azhar Qureshi said though Pakistan’s NDC was ambitious, it could not be explained that how it would be implemented.
“I want to know that how Pakistan would be able to contribute such a huge funding as it (country) is already facing severe financial crisis. Moreover, concerns regarding 10 billion tree tsunami project should be addressed. Climate change impact is continuously increasing but we don’t have concrete plan,” he said.
A speaker Zainab Zahid said that Ministry of Climate Change was approached by her to support those who were registered for the participation in COP26 but no one listened to her. Another environmentalist Hafiz Jawad also said that youth was the major representative among people of Pakistan but they don’t get representation in such events.
However, Mr Aslam said that a youth representative would also be sent in next COP27 which would be held in Egypt and representative would be selected through competitive basis.

2,Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s discretion to appoint SC judges challenged,The petition has been filed by the president and secretary of the Sindh High Court Bar Association.,"ISLAMABAD: The president and secretary of the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) challenged before the Supreme Court (SC) on Saturday the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s (JCP) discretion in the appointment of judges to the apex Court.
Through a joint petition, the petitioners, Salahuddin Ahmed and Mohammad Omer Soomro, have sought a declaration that the JCP should structure its discretion of elevating superior court judges by inviting suggestions from all relevant stakeholders, including judges, senior lawyers and bar representatives, members of the parliamentary committee, federal and provincial governments, civil society and litigants.
The suggestions should ask for structuring the process of judicial appointments to the superior courts and make it more objective and transparent by conducting seminars, workshops or consultations as may be necessary in this regard to hear all relevant viewpoints, the petition said.
It also pleaded that the apex court should direct the JCP to frame comprehensive and detailed rules or guidelines to structure both the process of appointments and criteria and parameters for appointments after considering the different aspects in light of suggestions, directives or framework the Supreme Court may deem it appropriate to make.
The petition also pleaded that till the pendency of the present petition, the seniority principle should be adhered to strictly in the elevation of the high court judges to the apex court.
The petition recalled how the five of the last seven judges elevated to the Supreme Court were not the senior-most in their high courts and during the tenure of former chief justice Mian Saqib Nisar, Justice Muneeb Akhtar was elevated to the apex court despite being fourth in seniority in the Sindh High Court (SHC).
Likewise during the tenure of the former chief justice, Asif Saeed Khan Khosa, Justice Qazi Amin Ahmed was elevated to the apex court in April 2019 although he had retired from the Lahore High Court (LHC) only a month earlier while ranked 26th in seniority.
Similarly Justice Aminuddin Ahmed was only fifth in seniority in the LHC prior to his elevation to the apex court, Justice Sayyed Mazahir Ali Akbar Naqvi was elevated to the Supreme Court despite being third in seniority in the LHC and most recently during the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan Gulzar Ahmed’s period, Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar was elevated to the apex court despite being fifth in seniority in the SHC, the petition highlighted.
This stark departure from the seniority principle — to the extent that deviation has become the new norm and adherence the exception — is a phenomenon that has started from 2018, the petition regretted, stating that previously, the appointment of junior judges from the high courts to the apex court was an exception and even then it was at most the senior-puisne judge who would be elevated and that too with the consent of his chief justice.
This recent trend of completely ignoring the seniority principle has led to serious concerns and misgivings among the legal fraternity and within the judiciary and even inside the JCP and the Parliamentary Committee, the petition argued.
Different bar councils and associations have been protesting the same since 2018 when Justice Muneeb Akhtar was appointed, the petition said.
Unfortunately reservations by different bar associations were ignored and the same have now culminated in resolutions passed by all the provincial and ICT bar councils as well as their principal high court bar associations, the Supreme Court Bar Association and the Pakistan Bar Council.
The abandonment of the seniority principle without any cogent reasons has given rise to dissensions among the JCP and the parliamentary committee, the petition argued, adding that on the other hand, superseded judges have been voicing their grievances at being bypassed both privately and publicly.
Not only does this reflect poorly on the reputation of the judicial institution but it is only natural that out-of-turn promotions have a negative impact on the morale and performance of those judges who feel that they have been bypassed unfairly and without cogent reasons.
Even the Attorney General of Pakistan has opined that there is a need to improve the process of judicial appointments to the apex court and frame objective and transparent criteria for the same.

4,FDE declares over 800 employees habitual latecomers,"Teachers’ body demands change in criteria, issuance of names of FDE officers as well","ISLAMABAD: The Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) has issued a list of 810 employees working in its headquarters and educational institutions who habitually come to work late.
The list includes the names of 19 heads of institutions/principals, three vice principals (headmasters/mistress), 16 associate professors, 24 assistant professors, 89 lecturers and four senior teachers.
However, representatives of teachers demanded a change to the yardstick of declaring an employee ‘habitual latecomer’ and also called for disclosing the names of officers working in the FDE who come late.
The list, available with Dawn, also includes the names of one director physical education, eight senior computer teachers, four computer teachers, nine junior teachers, two deputy headmistresses, 16 daily-wage teachers, 16 secondary school teachers, 21 trained graduate teachers, nine elementary school teachers, two DPI/PTI, 16 senior elementary teachers, one Qari, five computer lab attendants, 16 computer lab incharges, eight lab assistants, 15 lab attendants, four library assistants, one library attendant, 19 gardeners, 18 accountants, four admin officers, seven assistant private secretaries, 14 assistants, 59 watchmen, one superintendent, one telephone operator, two drivers, four conductors, 16 daily wagers, one electrician, five head clerks, one inspector, 38 UDCs, 129 LDCs, 77 Naib Qasids, 52 sanitation workers, one stenotypist, one storekeeper and five employees whose designation was not specified.

Teachers’ body demands change in criteria, issuance of names of FDE officers as well

A principal, requesting not to be named, claimed that the biometric attendance of employees from Nov 1 to Nov 24, 2021, was observed before issuing the list.
“We have heard that the names of around 17 officers of FDE, including directors and deputy directors, were also presented to the director general who arrived late in the office but their names were deleted from the list. Currently, the names of non-gazetted employees of the FDE and gazetted and non-gazetted employees of educational institutions have been mentioned in the list. So we demand that the names of FDE officers should also be mentioned,” he added.
President of Federal Government College Teachers Association Dr Rahima Rahman said: “Teachers at all times are devoted to their duties. They are responsible to take their classes and complete their academic assignments efficiently. They follow the timetable and never miss their classes. The official opening timing of educational institutions is 8:30am. If the class of a teacher is at 9:15am and he/she arrives at 9am it is not generally a big issue.”
“There are different timings for classes/periods. There should not be a similar yardstick to gauge the attendance of teachers. The biometric attendance system cannot assure quality education in the institutions,” she said.

A statement, issued here by the ministry, said COP26 was held in a successful manner with due recognition to Pakistan, during which useful meetings of the special assistant and the state minister with various heads of delegations, heads of international organisations, with UN bodies were held as per official schedule of meetings.
During the meetings, Pakistan’s green agenda was appreciated and Pakistan’s pavilion was one of the busiest pavilions lauded by the several heads of delegations and international organisations, the statement said.
While representing Pakistan both of them individually and jointly attended various events and highlighted the prominent initiatives of the government including Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Programme, Glacial Lake Outburst Flood , Climate Smart Agriculture, Protected Areas Initiatives, Clean Green Pakistan, etc., held during COP26. They maintained that they highlighted Pakistan as one of the top climate action champion countries of the world. “The officials of MoCC attending COP26 worked day and night and were able to make COP26 a successful event for Pakistan,” said the statement.
“The success of Pakistan in COP26 can be gauged from the facts that the British government had regarded Pakistan as one of the four countries ranked as nature champions out of 196 countries in the world. Also, the UN system has declared Pakistan as one of the top three countries ranked as Forestry Leaders, among 196 countries across the Globe,” Malik Amin Aslam said while talking to Dawn.
“MNA Riaz Fityana was not part of Pakistan’s official delegation and was representing a non-governmental organization without any invitation of MoCC,” said Malik Amin Aslam.

7,Work on Tourism Highway to begin next month,"Road to set up new transport, trade link between Pindi’s three tehsils, tourist destinations","RAWALPINDI: The Punjab government will inaugurate work on the 123.6km-long Tourism Highway next month.
This was decided in a meeting of PTI’s parliamentarians from the area. It was also decided that two functions would be arranged - one in Kahuta and the other in Kotli Sattian - to inaugurate the road work.
The road will commence from Chowk Pindori Kallar Syedan and go on till Mator, Payor and Punjar in Kahuta. It will further connect Chent.
Though there is already a highway from Chent to Kotli Sattian, a new road will be built from Kotli Sattian to Lower Topa, which will then connect Muzaffarabad in future.

Road to set up new transport, trade link between Pindi’s three tehsils, tourist destinations

On the other hand, the Punjab government imposed Section 144 in the area where the road would be constructed to stop sale and purchase of land till the completion of land acquisition.
Section 144 has been implemented in the area of the proposed road alignment to build the tourism highway for three months.
Additional Chief Secretary Home Punjab Zafar Nasrullah Khan has issued a notification in accordance with the powers vested in him under Section 144 (6) of the Criminal Code, 1898. Any construction on either side of the 220-foot road is prohibited.
According to a senior official of the district administration, the cost of the tourism highway under the Public Sector Development Programme 2021-22 has been estimated at Rs4.051 billion.
He said it would be the shortest possible road link to connect New Murree to Panjpeer Rocks, adding that, “the proposed road link will reduce the travelling time between both tourist destinations”.
The official said stop over and camping sites were available for tourists on either sides of the track while two beautiful natural streams (flowing throughout the year) will cross the track at different locations, giving an access to tourists to undertake water activities.
This proposed road link will also establish a new transport and trade link between the three tehsils and tourist destinations of Rawalpindi district.
This proposed road link will facilitate the local inhabitants leading to an economic and tourism growth in the hilly belt of Punjab.
The senior official said 6,610 vehicles were expected to pass daily through the 123.62km-long tourism highway in Rawalpindi district.
Under the scheme, he said Rs2,486 million would be spend on road work, Rs912m on road structure, Rs180.359m on road furniture and Rs39m on land acquisition.

ISLAMABAD: First lady Samina Alvi on Saturday said self-dependent women could play a productive role in the progress of their families as well the society.
Addressing the opening ceremony of an annual charity bazaar held by the Pakistan Foreign Office Women Association (PFOWA), she said the government had taken various measures to make women self-dependent.
Held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the bazaar provided a mix of cultures and cuisines with stalls depicting artifacts and apparels of multiple countries.
The stalls were set up by embassies of various countries, including China, Turkey, Thailand, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, UAE, European Union, besides educational institutes and private companies.
Ms Alvi exemplified the women-specific easy loan scheme launched by the government and urged the citizens to never ignore the differently-abled people rather develop inclusivity for them.
She lauded the association for keeping up its charitable services even during the pandemic besides taking part in awareness drives on breast cancer.
She also asked women to spare just five minutes for their self-examination for an early diagnosis of breast cancer.
She said besides charity, the bazaar had become a source of cultural affinity and social contacts. She expressed the hope that the activity would contribute to the welfare of deserving people besides promoting the national culture.
Referring to the display of artisans’ work, she called for exchange of artists to promote art as well as generate economic activity.
The first lady urged educational institutions to arrange skill training for their students which was essential to enhance their acceptability in the market.
Earlier, Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood said the bazaar had become a part of Islamabad’s social calendar contributing to fundraising for charity works.

10,Lawyers warn of protests if AJK high court judges not appointed in a month,MUZAFFARABAD: Legal practitioners of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) have warned of complete boycott of judicial work ...,"MUZAFFARABAD: Legal practitioners of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) have warned of complete boycott of judicial work as well as a demonstration in the federal capital if the long due appointments of judges in the region’s High Court are not made within one month.
The warning came through a resolution, adopted by the top office bearers of the AJK supreme court and AJK high court bar associations as well as the bar associations of different districts and tehsils, at a meeting in the lakeside city of Mirpur.
AJK Bar Council vice chairman Fayyaz Haider Nawabi was also present on the occasion.
“The authorities concerned [in Islamabad and Muzaffarabad] should make appointments against the [eight] vacant posts of judges in the high court within one month in accordance with the Constitution, relevant laws and principle of merit,” demanded the resolution.
“During this month lawyers will boycott judicial work only on Thursdays as a mark of symbolic protest over the inordinate delay. However, after one month they will go on complete strike followed by a demonstration at D-Chowk in Islamabad,” it added.
With a sanctioned strength of nine judges, the AJK high court has been functioning with only one judge – Chief Justice Sadaqat Hussain Raja - since May this year due to which the old and fresh petitions cannot be taken up, to the detriment of the lawyers and litigants alike.
Between Nov 2019 and July 2020, six HC judges, one of them a sitting CJ, were sent packing by the AJK apex court through two separate but almost identical verdicts on account of some “technical mistakes” in their appointment process, leaving the high court with only three judges as against its sanctioned strength of 9.
Of the three judges, one retired on attaining superannuation on March 22 this year and the other died of brain hemorrhage on May 3. Justice Sadaqat, who was thus left as the only judge, was elevated initially as acting and later as permanent CJ.
According to the AJK Constitution, the apex court judges are appointed by the AJK president on the advice of the AJK Council chairman – the prime minister of Pakistan - and after consultations with the AJK CJ. Appointment of judges in the high court involves additional consultations with its chief justice.
As Justice Raja Saeed Akram was sworn in as AJK’s permanent CJ on May 18 this year, two judges were directly appointed in the apex court within a week to complete its sanctioned strength of three.
However, there has been no progress with regard to the appointments in the high court despite the passage of nearly four months after the installation of the new government in AJK, led by the PTI.
Speaking at the Mirpur event, Babar Ali Khan, president of the high court bar association, regretted that the governments in Islamabad and Muzaffarabad were paying no attention to this important issue.
He pointed out that the dictum laid down by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the famous al-Jihad Trust case which was also declared applicable to AJK’s judiciary by the AJK supreme court, made it clear that “the permanent vacancies occurring in the office of the CJ and judges should normally be filled in immediately not later than 30 days but a vacancy occurring before the due date on account of death or for any reason should be filled in within 90 days on permanent basis.”
“But ironically no one seems to be bothered about the wilful infringement of the apex court judgment in AJK, where posts have been lying vacant for more than a year,” he said.

13,Govt to provide Rs7 million to police stations,Account officers to be appointed at police stations to maintain funding record,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad Development Working Party (IDWP) has decided to directly provide funding to police stations aimed at eradicating the culture of bribe.
The federal government will provide around Rs7 million to police stations and appoint or depute 22 account officers directly at the police stations to maintain the funding record.
According to a statement issued by Capital Development Authority (CDA) the meeting of the IDWP was held with CDA Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed in the chair.
Besides approving 680 million for cameras surveillance of entry points of Islamabad, the party has ordered performance audit of safe city cameras.

Account officers to be appointed at police stations to maintain funding record

“During the meeting, two projects for Islamabad police were approved. These projects would help in improving security situation in the city. In this context meeting approved 680 million for cameras surveillance of entry points of Islamabad,” it stated.
“Hiring of accounts staff for police station was also approved after that police stations will function financially independently. This will also lead to better check and audit control system at police stations. This step will provide budget to each police station for the first time and the same will be spent at police station level. The chair directed that performance audit of cameras already installed in ICT be carried out and presented to the IDWP forum so that linkage can be established on efficacy of technology and crime control,” statement concludes.
Spokesperson of Chief Commissioner Office, while talking to Dawn, said in the past police stations did not have funds due to which officials used to demand money from the criminals and their families for fuel, photocopies of documents, phone calls and a number of other activities such as shifting cost of suspect to court.
“Unfortunately all those amounts were paid by the families. Now Rs7 million has been allocated for each police station and as many as 22 accounts officers will either be appointed or deputed from surplus pool to maintain the record of expenses,” he said.
He said while allocating funds to procure more cameras, it was decided to do performance audit of already existing cameras.

14,"1,252 kanals of societies in Islamabad registered without tax",Islamabad DC says the final approval for the transfer of the land has not been accorded so far.,"ISLAMABAD: The district administration registered 1,252 kanal prime land in the name of three persons without collection of over Rs360 million mandatory capital value tax (CVT), documents available with Dawn revealed.
According to the documents, officials of six revenue estates of Islamabad registered the land in the name of Raja Ali Akbar Tabassum, Chaudhry Abdul Rehman and Shujaatullah Qureshi.
Tabassum and Rehman are founders of Ghouri Town. They swapped 626 kanal with Qureshi who is the secretary of the management committee of Intelligence Bureau Employees Cooperative Housing Society (IBECHS).
The agreement for exchange of land between Ghouri Town and the society was signed on May 15, 2014. As per the agreement, Tabassum and Rehman provided 626 kanals to the society in return for the latter’s land of the same size. The agreement was executed in December last year.
The revenue office of the district administration then registered the entries of 1,252 kanals in the name of the above mentioned persons. However, none of them deposited the CVT despite the lapse of about a year.
CVT has been imposed through section 7 of the Finance Act 1989 which places the responsibility of collecting it on the registering or attesting authority at the time of registering or attesting the transfer. According to the Federal Board of Revenue rules, CVT is payable by individuals, firms and companies which acquire an asset by purchase or a right to use for more than 20 years.
The revenue officer, Tehsildar Awais Khan, could not be contacted for comments despite repeated attempts.
Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Hamza Shafqaat confirmed that the revenue officials had registered the land in the revenue record without collection of the CVT.
However, he said, the final approval for transfer of 1,252 kanals had not been accorded so far.
Interestingly, the revenue officials did not cancel the registration for non-deposit of the CVT.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has initiated an inquiry into the allegations of tax evasion, illegal extension and commercialisation by IBECHS. The society has filed a petition in the IHC against the inquiry initiated on the direction of the Supreme Court.
