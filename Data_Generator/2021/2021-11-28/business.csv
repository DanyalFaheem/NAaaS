0,Profits outflow down 16pc in July-October,Fresh foreign investment declined 12pc during the period under review.,"KARACHI: The outflow of profits and dividends on foreign investment in Pakistan witnessed a decline of 16.5 per cent during the first four months of the current fiscal year (4MFY22). 
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported that outflow of profits fell to $566.6 million compared to $678.6m during the same period in FY21.  
The biggest outflow was from banks indicating that financial business in the country was in the best shape yielding highest profits. Almost all banks showed profits in their annual and quarterly reports. The profits outflow during July-Oct FY22 was $125m against an outflow of $91m in the same period of FY21. 
However, highest jump in the profits outflow was noted in the power sector. The profits outflow from this sector rose to $72.8m compared to just $9.3m in the same period of FY21. Within the power sector, thermal power saw an outflow of $69.2m compared to $8.5m during 4MFY21.  
The food sector noted the biggest decline of profits outflow during 4MFY22. The outflows during this period fell to $84.2m compared to a profit outflow of $161m during 4MFY21. 
The profits outflow from communications also noted a decline to $89.3m during this period compared to $118.7m of previous fiscal year. Within communications, the outflow from telecommunications dropped to $52m compared to $104m while the profits outflow from IT sector increased to $37m compared to 14.8m of previous fiscal. 
The profits outflow from transport fell to $42m against $69m of previous fiscal while it decreased to $30.5m from the chemical sector against an outflow of $56.7m. 
The profits from tobacco and cigarettes also fell significantly to $22m compared to $50m of the previous fiscal year. 
The macro indicators of the economy show a better growth trend during FY22 but the outflow of profits showed a decline. Analysts believe foreign investors were reinvesting their profits in the country as they see higher growth in several sectors.  
However, fresh foreign investment declined by 12pc during 4MFY22. The SBP data shows the FDI during July-Oct FY22 was $662m compared to $750m in the same period of FY21. 
Foreign investment also eroded from the domestic bonds market as the outflow from Treasury bills and Pakistan Inves­tment Bond were much higher than the low inflows. The investment outflow from equ­ity market during FY22 was also very high.

1,PSX tumbles 5.1pc on policy rate hike in a week,"The KSE-100 index lost 2,375 points or 5.11 per cent on a weekly basis to close at 44,114 points.","KARACHI: The benchmark of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) registered the highest weekly decline after March 27, 2020, in the outgoing week.
The KSE-100 index lost 2,375 points or 5.11 per cent on a weekly basis to close at 44,114 points. According to Arif Habib Ltd, the decline in the value of shares was mainly because of the State Bank of Pakistan increasing its policy rate by 150 basis points to 8.75pc coupled with an alarming current account deficit that widened to $5.1 billion in the first four months of 2020-21.
Other key drivers of the decline in the share market included the continuation of net selling by foreign investors amid the PSX’s transition from MSCI’s emerging market to frontier market as well as a decline in foreign exchange reserves that put pressure on the national currency. 
The fact that the last week was also a rollover week also led to chaotic and gloomy sentiments on the bourse, it added.
Despite the announcement of a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), investors’ sentiments remained subdued. 
There was, nonetheless, a rebound of sorts in the benchmark index after petroleum dealers ended their strike following an agreement with the government to increase their margin. 
The news about the inflow of $3bn from Saudi Arabia next week and a sharp decline in international oil prices also gave a breather to the stock market.
Sector-wise, contribution to the downside was led by cement, which took away 462 points from the index, followed by commercial banking (326 points), technology and communication (290 points), fertiliser (270 points) and oil and gas exploration (252 points).
Scrip-wise, major losers were Lucky Cement, which dropped 205 points, followed by TRG Pakistan (177 points), Habib Bank Ltd (114 points), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (98 points) and Engro Corporation (95 points).
Foreigners sold stocks worth $39.1 million versus a net sell of $25m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in commercial banking ($15.7m) and fertiliser ($6.3m). On the local front, buying was reported by individuals ($16m) and companies ($13.3m). 
The average daily volume and traded value for the outgoing week were up 8pc and 13pc to 264m shares and $60m, respectively.
According to AKD Securities, the stock market is likely to switch gears and shift to the positive side in the coming week. 
The expectation of the change in direction is on the back of a meltdown in crude oil market, which will give some relief on the commodities’ front. 
On the flipside, the news of a new Covid-19 variant may give rise to panic across the globe, it added.

2,Poor boardroom governance mars Discos’ performance,Research paper says chairmen of 10 distribution companies aren’t certified directors.,"KARACHI: None of the 10 chairmen in as many electricity distribution companies (Discos) is a certified director from the Pakistan Institute of Corporate Governance (PICG), an independent training body set up by multiple regulatory authorities to improve boardroom governance in the corporate sector.
According to a recent research paper by Afia Malik of the Pakistan Institute of Dev­e­lopment Economics (PIDE), only three of the 40 independent directors on the Disco boards are PICG-certified directors.
The bifurcation of the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) in November 2007 created initially eight and eventually 10 Discos that are now distributing electricity to end-consumers in their respective geographical areas as monopolies. Their overall performance is less than satisfactory as almost one-fifth of electricity units generated in the country were lost in the transmission and distribution (T&D) network in 2020-21.

Research paper says chairmen of 10 distribution companies aren’t certified directors

“Discos lack technical and managerial skills to operate independently. The structure of these companies based on corporate governance principles has not been established. Poor corporate governance is the main reason behind the poor technical and financial performance of Discos,” wrote Ms Malik.
New boards were appointed in all the 10 Discos in the last seven months. During the selection process, the Power Division relied on the candidates’ enlistment as independent directors with the PICG, their CVs, and affidavits from each proposed nominee that they fulfill the fit-and-proper criteria as required under the rules. “While going through the profile of these independent directors, wherever available, we find that the actual practice is different from what was stated in the [newspapers],” it said.
As many as 11 directors serve on the boards of two Discos while one of them is on three boards at the same time. At least five of the 10 appointed chairmen of Discos happen to be ex-employees of K-Electric Ltd, a privatised distribution company that sells power to Karachi-based consumers. “In the selection of independent directors, the focus seems to be on those with K-Electric experience. In total, 10 independent directors, including chairpersons, remained affiliated with K-Electric in various capacities,” it said.
The paper noted that Disco board chairmen were appointed against Corporate Governance Rules 2013, which state that the chairperson be elected by the board to achieve an appropriate balance of power, increase accountability and improve the board’s capacity to exercise independent judgment. “But in these Discos, the chairman is appointed by the government,” it said.
Similarly, the government also appoints Disco CEOs against the rules, which state that this responsibility belongs to the respective boards. Besides, the government takes all major decisions, which is “evident from the minutes of board meetings” that discuss only human resource–related issues.
None of the 10 Discos publishes its annual company report except Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco), Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco) and Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco).

3,World Trade Organisation cancels ministerial moot due to Covid variant,The conference has already been postponed once before due to the pandemic.,"GENEVA: Next week’s World Trade Organisation (WTO) ministerial conference, the global trade body’s biggest gathering in four years, was postponed at the last minute on Friday due to the new Omicron Covid-19 variant.
The WTO hoped the four-day gathering in Geneva would breathe new life into the crippled organisation, which has been stuck for years trying to make progress on resolving issues like fishery subsidies.
New director-general Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala was also hoping, against the odds, to make progress towards a deal on lifting Covid vaccine patents, proving the WTO had a relevant role to play in combating the pandemic.
But the conference was postponed four days before it was due to start, hours after Omicron was declared a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation.
Fears surrounding the spread of the variant saw countries banning flights from southern Africa, where the strain was first detected on November 9.
“This has not been an easy recommendation to make,” Okonjo-Iweala said.
“But as director-general, my priority is the health and safety of all MC12 participants – ministers, delegates and civil society. It is better to err on the side of caution.” 
WTO General Council chair Dacio Castillo called an emergency meeting of all 164 member states to tell them about the Omicron situation, including travel restrictions and quarantine requirements.
The members unanimously supported the postponement call.
Okonjo-Iweala said the travel constraints would have prevented many ministers from reaching Geneva, rendering equal participation impossible.
The beleaguered WTO’s 12th ministerial conference (MC12) has already been postponed once before due to the pandemic. It was originally due to take place in Kazakhstan’s capital Nur-Sultan in June 2020.
The WTO intends to reconvene “as soon as possible when conditions allow”, said Castillo.
IP waiver must wait: The conference normally takes place every two years.
It was expected to draw more than 100 ministers to Geneva, where the organisation is based, including heads of state, plus 4,000 or so delegates.
The gathering was being seen as a test of Okonjo-Iweala’s ability to fulfil promises to turn around the crisis-hit institution.
The Nigerian former foreign minister, who in March became the first African and first woman to lead the WTO, has been widely hailed for her revitalisation efforts.
She has helped kick-start blocked trade negotiations, and made reaching a long-elusive deal to end harmful fishery subsidies a top priority for the conference.
She also stressed the urgency of agreeing on how to remove trade barriers blocking access to Covid-19 vaccines.

4,OICCI seeks clarity over sales tax payment by distributors,KARACHI: The Ove­rseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has said that the issue of declaring...,"KARACHI: The Ove­rseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has said that the issue of declaring distributors as “service providers” has posed challenges for those companies/distributors that are registered with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and have already paid federal sales tax to the FBR. 
In a Nov 24 letter addressed simultaneously to FBR chairman Dr Muhammad Ashfaque Ahmed and Sindh Revenue Board chairman Dr Wasif Ali Memon, the representative body of over 203 foreign businesses operating in the country said the recent judgment of the Sindh High Court (SHC) declaring that distributors are liable to Sindh sales tax on services carries implications for foreign investors. 
“No guidance is available as to which portion of the sales tax needs to be deposited to the FBR or the SRB and how the Sindh sales tax imposed by the SRB will be claimed from the FBR. 
Hence, we request the FBR and the SRB to mutually decide which portion of the sales tax from the overall sales tax needs to be deposited with which authority,” it said. 
The Ove­rseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry asserted that the prime reason for working through a distributor is to sell goods to a person who has the capacity to sell it further down the value chain. 
That’s the reason the transaction between a company and its distributor has long been accepted as a sale-purchase transaction not only in Pakistan but also globally, it said. 
“Until resolved, this uncertainty is hampering the businesses and creating operating hurdles for our 200-plus OICCI members who have presence in 14 sectors of the economy and contribute nearly one-third of Pakistan’s total tax revenue,” it added.

5,Blacklisted Chinese firm seeks similar action against ‘favourites’,The firm was blacklisted in October by the NTDC and barred from participating in any tender for a month.,"LAHORE: A Chinese firm, which was blacklisted in October by the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC), has sought similar action against five companies for submitting forged documents while participating in bidding for various projects.
The complaint filed by the company has also proved to be genuine after an inquiry team thoroughly examined it along with the evidence, Dawn has learnt.
“The Chinese firm was blacklisted last month and barred from participating in any tender for one month. However, in a recent complaint submitted to the NTDC managing director (MD), the firm called the decision based on mala fide intention and discriminatory, asking why various ‘favourite’ firms were not treated the same way,” an official source in the NTDC told Dawn on Saturday.
The NTDC — a state-owned subsidiary of the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) — had on Oct 11 blacklisted a Chinese firm over allegations of preparing and submitting forged documents to the department concerned during the bidding of a project for the procurement of insulator hardware assemblies, including Pre-RTV-Coated 160kN disc insulator (anti-fog type, porcelain or glass) for 500kV D/C Quad Bundle Transmission Lines for power evacuation from K-2/K-3 nuclear power plants.
On the other hand, the NTDC management has been told by an inquiry committee that the way the Chinese firm was treated seemed to be discriminatory, as some companies whose documents were also proved bogus during scrutiny for various tenders and projects were ‘favoured’ allegedly by some officers.
“Since the proofs appended with the firm’s complaint show that some bids of several companies in various projects were declared non-responsive instead of blacklisting them, the firm sought to also blacklist them,” the source added.
The official said the team probing the complaint also declared the firm’s stance based on facts. “The team in its report has termed the punishment given to the firm discriminatory, recommending to the MD to also take similar action against the companies declared non-responsive instead of being blacklisted in tendering process of various projects,” he added.
Talking to Dawn, NTDC MD Manzoor Ahmad said he would take appropriate action once he went through the complaint and the inquiry report. “I took over charge as MD last week. But I will look into the issue soon and take action,” he added.

7,"Sindh decries PM’s remarks, asserts no fertiliser crisis in province",Sindh govt representatives say PM Imran is blaming the provincial govt to cover up his govt's shortcomings.,"KARACHI: The Sindh government on Saturday denied the federal government’s allegations of a fertiliser crisis and its price hike in the province.  
Representatives of the Sindh government said Prime Minister Imran Khan was blaming the provincial government to cover up his government’s shortcomings.  
Addressing a joint press conference, Sindh CM’s Adviser on Agriculture Manzoor Wassan, accompanied by Sindh Energy Minister Imtiaz Shaikh and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawala, said the price of diammonium phosphate (DAP), the world’s most widely used phosphorus fertiliser, was still lower in Sindh than in Punjab.  
The agriculture adviser said the PM had “adopted the method” of Muttahida Qaumi Movement’s founder who issued threats and then cried. “That’s why I am naming him (PM) Altaf Khan,” he sarcastically said.  
He predicted that 2022 would be a “dangerous” year for the prime minister. “Imran Khan may either resign in October or himself dissolve the assembly.”  
Mr Wassan said that PTI was unable to run the country’s affairs, adding that the federal government blamed the provincial government if there was any crisis or shortage of anything in the country. “Avoid creating a sense of deprivation in Sindh and hold fresh elections to steer out the country from the ongoing crises,” he advised the prime minister.  
He said that officials of the provincial agriculture department had taken effective and strict action against the profiteers and made surprise visits to control urea prices, imposing fines and making arrests. He said that 22 FIRs were registered against those who sold DAP at exorbitant prices.  
Answering a question, he alleged the federal government was conspiring against the Sindh government.  
The provincial energy minister said gas was an important issue in Sindh. The federal government had deliberately created shortage of gas in the country, he alleged.   
He said that Sindh, which produced more than 68 per cent of the total gas produced in the country, had been deprived of gas. “If you are not capable of handling a fair distribution of gas, then hand over Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) to Sindh, we have the capacity to run it (properly),” he added.  
He deplored that Sindh was not given any representation in the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra). “The province does not have representation even in Hesco and Sepco. This is adding to the sense of deprivation among the people of Sindh,” he added.  
He urged the prime minister to take concrete action against incompetent members of the federal cabinet. “Changing ministers won’t solve the problems,” he added.
