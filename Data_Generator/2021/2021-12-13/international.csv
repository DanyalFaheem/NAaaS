0,Pandemic pushed 500 million people into poverty: WHO,"The pandemic disrupted health services globally and triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, says global health body.","GENEVA/VIENNA: More than half a billion (500 million) people globally were pushed into extreme poverty last year as they paid for health costs out of their own pockets during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, the World Health Organisation and the World Bank said on Sunday.
The pandemic disrupted health services globally and triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it even more difficult for people to pay for healthcare, according to a joint statement from both the organisations.
“All governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences,” WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
Tedros urged governments to increase their focus on healthcare systems and stay on course towards universal health coverage, which the WHO defines as everyone getting access to health services they need without financial hardship.
Healthcare is a major political issue in the United States, one of the few industrialised countries that does not have universal cover for its citizens.
Globally, the pandemic made things worse and immunisation coverage dropped for the first time in ten years, with deaths from tuberculosis and malaria increasing.
“Within a constrained fiscal space, governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets,” Juan Pablo Uribe, global director for health, nutrition and population at World Bank, said. Meanwhile, Austria  ended lockdown restrictions for vaccinated people across most of the  country on Sunday, three weeks after reimposing strict rules to combat a  rising wave of coronavirus infections.
The rules, which vary by  region within the country, largely allow for the reopening of theaters,  museums and other cultural and entertainment venues on Sunday. Shops  will follow on Monday. Some regions are reopening restaurants and  hotels on Sunday, while others will wait until later in the month. In  all cases, there will be an 11pm curfew for restaurants, and masks  will still be required on public transportation and inside stores and  public spaces.
Chancellor Karl Nehammer last week called the move  an opening with a seatbelt, giving each of Austria’s nine regions the  ability to loosen or tighten restrictions based on the local situation.
Unvaccinated  people will still be subject to the lockdown restrictions and should  remain at home for all but a handful of specific reasons, like buying  groceries, going to the doctor or exercising.

1,Putin says he drove cab after Soviet fall,Russian president says disintegration three decades ago remains a  “tragedy” for  “most citizens”.,"MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin has said the collapse of the Soviet Union spelled the end of  “historical Russia,” revealing he drove a taxi to make ends meet following the USSR’s fall.
Putin, a former agent of the Soviet Union’s KGB security services, who has previously lamented the USSR’s fall, said the disintegration three decades ago remains a  “tragedy” for  “most citizens”.
The comments, reported by state-run news agency RIA Novosti on Sunday, were excerpts from an upcoming film by broadcaster Channel One, dubbed  “Russia Recent History”.
“After all, what is the collapse of the Soviet Union? This is the collapse of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union,” the Russian leader was cited as saying.
A loyal servant of the Soviet Union, Putin was dismayed when it fell apart, once calling the collapse  “the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century”.
Putin is sensitive to the perceived expansion of Western military ambitions into ex-Soviet countries and Russia this week demanded that Nato formally scrap a 2008 decision to open its door to Georgia and Ukraine. The end of the Union brought with it a period of intense economic instability that plunged many into poverty, as newly independent Russia transitioned from communism to capitalism.
RIA-Novosti, reporting from excerpts of the documentary, said Putin had revealed that he worked occasionally as a taxi driver to boost his income. 
“Sometimes I had to earn extra money,” Putin said.
“I mean, earn extra money by car, as a private driver. It’s unpleasant to talk about to be honest but, unfortunately, that was the case.” Russia was the centre of the Soviet Union that grew to include 15 republics from the Baltics in the West to Central Asia.
In 1991, wracked by economic woes the Soviet Union disintegrated and Russia became an independent nation.

2,British PM accused of breaching Covid rules,"He has faced a barrage of criticism and calls to quit over claims of an illegal Downing Street party on Dec 18, 2020.","LONDON: Boris Johnson on Sunday faced fresh questions about alleged government breaches of coronavirus restrictions after a photo emerged of him at a Christmas event last year.
The British prime minister has faced a barrage of criticism and calls to quit over claims of an illegal Downing Street party on December 18, 2020.
He has repeatedly said he was assured the gathering complied with social distancing restrictions in place at the time and has ordered an internal investigation.
But the Sunday Mirror published a photograph of Johnson said to have been taken three days before that party, at a  “virtual quiz” for his staff, in which four teams of six people took part to raise funds for charity.
Christmas lunches and parties that were  “primarily social activity” were banned at the time, as Britain — one of the worst-hit countries by Covid-19 — battled a surge in cases of the Delta coronavirus strain.
Mixing of more than two people from two households indoors was banned, scuppering Christmas plans for millions after months of tight restrictions, including lockdown. The left-leaning Sunday Mirror said Johnson took part for up to 15 minutes and asked questions as quizmaster in one round.
Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi dismissed the latest report, telling Sky News television:  “Many people would have had similar Zoom quiz nights around the country.” But the main opposition Labour party said it showed Johnson presided over  “a culture of disregard for the rules at the heart of government”, after a slew of claims that parties were held across Whitehall last Christmas.
An Opinium poll for The Observer put Labour nine points ahead of Johnson’s Conservatives, and suggested 57 percent of people think he should quit — up nine points from just two weeks ago.
Johnson’s popularity rating fell to -35 percent, down from a record low of -21 percent in the same period, the newspaper said. The claims of double-standards have put Johnson’s position under threat at a crucial time.
MPs vote next week on the government’s latest proposed restrictions to curb the spread of the Omicron variant, with many Tories unhappy at plans to introduce mandatory vaccine passports.
Johnson also faces a by-election in a safe Tory seat vacated by an MP found to have illegally lobbied ministers on behalf of two companies that had him on their payroll.
A significant rebellion in the House of Commons and either a defeat or substantial loss of majority in Thursday’s by-election could see calls for Johnson to go reach fever pitch.
One commentator said the by-election was effectively  “a referendum” on his premiership.

3,Modi’s Twitter account hacked again,NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Twitter account was hacked on Sunday with a message declaring his...,"NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Twitter account was hacked on Sunday with a message declaring his country had adopted bitcoin as legal tender and was distributing the cryptocurrency to citizens.
Modi is a prolific tweeter and is the world’s most popular incumbent politician on the platform, with more than 73 million followers on his main account.
A swiftly deleted tweet from his main @narendramodi handle said the Indian government had officially bought 500 bitcoin and was  “and distributing them to all residents of the country”, along with a scam link.
His office tweeted that the account was  “very briefly compromised” and that Twitter had since restored control.
It was the second time one of Modi’s Twitter accounts was hacked, after another was taken over last year to send out a tweet urging the public to donate to a fake coronavirus relief fund.
Sunday’s hack ironically comes as India prepares to clamp down on a flourishing cryptocurrency trade with a new law likely to be introduced in parliament this month.
Details of the legislation remain unclear but the government has flagged a broad ban on private digital currencies.
The local crypto market has boomed since the Indian Supreme Court overturned a previous ban last year, with Bollywood actors and cricket stars fronting ad campaigns for local exchanges.
Modi himself said last month that cryptocurrencies could  “spoil our youth” and the central bank has repeatedly warned they could pose  “serious concerns on macroeconomic and financial stability”.

4,New Caledonia rejects independence from France in boycotted vote,"With all ballots counted, 96.49 percent were against independence, while only 3.51 percent were in favour.","NOUMEA: Islanders on the Pacific territory of New Caledonia voted overwhelmingly on Sunday to remain part of France in a third referendum that was boycotted by pro-independence groups, raising fears of new tensions.
With all ballots counted, 96.49 percent were against independence, while only 3.51 percent were in favour, with turnout a mere 43.90 percent, results from the islands’ high commission showed.
“Tonight France is more beautiful because New Caledonia has decided to stay part of it,” President Emmanuel Macron said in a recorded video message that made no direct mention of the boycott.
Police reinforcements have been sent to the territory known as  “the pebble”, which is of strategic importance to France and part of a wider tussle for influence in the Pacific between Western countries and China.
The boycott and crushing nature of the  “No” vote will raise fears of protests as well as questions about the democratic legitimacy of the referendum on the archipelago, 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles) east of Australia.
Macron noted  “the high abstention rates” but said France could be  “proud” of a more than 30-year process designed to settle the islands’ status under which residents were asked in three separate referendums if they wished to break away.
Having rejected independence in 2018 and then again last year, inhabitants were called on Sunday to answer one last time whether they wanted New Caledonia  “to accede to full sovereignty and become independent”.
Pro-independence campaigners boycotted the vote, saying they wanted it postponed to September because  “a fair campaign” was impossible with high coronavirus infection numbers.
The result could exacerbate ethnic tensions, with the poorer indigenous Kanak community who generally favour independence staying away from polling booths on Sunday. The wealthier white community turned out in large numbers.
“We have decided in our souls and consciences to remain French,” Sonia Backes, a senior pro-France figure, told supporters on Sunday evening.
“The sad dreams of an independence at the cost of ruin, of exclusion and misery have crashed on the reef of our pioneering spirit, our resilience and our love for our own land,” she added.
The main indigenous pro-independence movement, the FLNKS, had called the government’s insistence on going ahead with the referendum  “a declaration of war”.
Kanaks had also been called by their traditional community leaders to observe a day’s mourning on Sunday for those killed by the coronavirus.
Around 2,000 police and troops were deployed for the vote, which appeared to have passed off largely without incident except for an attempted roadblock on an outlying island.
At stake in the vote was one of France’s biggest overseas territories which is home to about 10 percent of the world’s reserves of nickel, which is used to make stainless steel, batteries and mobile phones.
The territory is also a key part of France’s claim of being a Pacific power, with New Caledonia granting France rights to the surrounding ocean, as well as serving as a military staging post.

Local gemologists, who have examined the sapphire, said it was one of the rarest gems in the world as it weighed more than 300 kilograms. International organisations are yet to certify the precious stone.
The sapphire was put on display at the home of one of the gem pit owners in Horana, 65 kilometres (40 miles) south of Colombo. A group of Buddhist monks chanted blessings for the gemstone before it was unveiled.
The stone was found in the gem-rich Ratnapura area where local people had previously found the world’s largest star sapphire cluster in a backyard by accident  Ratnapura is known as the gem capital of the South Asian country, which is a leading exporter of sapphires and other precious gems.
The country earned around half a billion dollars through the export of gems, diamonds and other jewellery last year, the local gems and jewellery industry body has reported.

Several rounds of United Nations-brokered negotiations in Geneva since 2019 between the government and opposition aimed at forging a new constitution have so far failed.
“I think there is a possibility now to start to explore what I call ‘a step for step’ approach, where you put on the table steps that is defined with precisions, that is verifiable, that hopefully can start to build some trust,” he said after talks in Damascus with Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad.
“My message is that there is another possibility to start to explore possible avenues, to start to move forward on this process,” he told journalists.
Pedersen has toured all the main foreign players with a stake in Syria’s conflict.
With major fighting having subsided since 2020, Damascus has made inroads into easing its international isolation, especially with fellow Arab states.
“I think we should now analyse not only the Arabs but also the American position, the Europeans, the Turkish, the Russians, the Iranians,” the UN envoy said.
The war in Syria is estimated to have killed nearly half a million people and displaced millions more since it began with a brutal crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011.
It quickly spiralled into a complex conflict that pulled in numerous actors, including jihadist groups and foreign powers.
Throughout the civil war, the UN has been striving to nurture a political resolution.

Anne Rice

 
WASHINGTON: Anne Rice, the gothic novelist best known for writing  Interview with the Vampire, died on Saturday aged 80, her family said.
“In her final hours, I sat beside her hospital bed in awe of her accomplishments and her courage,” her son Christopher Rice said in a post on her Facebook page.
He said she died of complications from a stroke.
“Interview with the Vampire,” published in 1976, was made into a movie starring Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in 1994.
She wrote dozens of books, many of them in the  “Vampire” series, selling more than 150 million worldwide.
Another of her works, The Queen of the Damned, was adapted into a film in 2002.
“The immensity of our family’s grief cannot be overstated. As my mother, her support for me was unconditional — she taught me to embrace my dreams, reject conformity and challenge the dark voices of fear and self-doubt,” her son wrote.
“As a writer, she taught me to defy genre boundaries and surrender to my obsessive passions.” She will be interred at a private ceremony in New Orleans, the statement said.
A public celebration will be held next year in the city, with  “friends, readers and fans” invited, her son added.

The announcement marks another dramatic twist in the 13-month-old conflict that has killed thousands of people and triggered a deep humanitarian crisis in the north of Africa’s second most populous nation.
Tigrayan fighters  “are in the town centre, there’s no fighting”, said a resident reached by telephone on Sunday afternoon.
“Yes they came back. They are already here,” said a second resident, adding that they appeared to have come from the east, in the direction of Woldiya.
“The population, most of the people are scared. Some are running away. Most of the people, they already left because there might be a revenge. We expressed our happiness before when the junta left.” The Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) rebel group’s military leadership said in a statement shared with pro-TPLF media they had launched  “comprehensive counter-offensives” in numerous locations including along the road linking Gashena and Lalibela.
“Our forces first defended and then carried out counter-offensives against the huge force that was attacking on the Gashena front and surrounding areas and managed to achieve (a) glorious and astonishing victory,” it said.

9,"G7 issues strong warnings on Iran, Russia",Britain portrayed the two-day conference in Liverpool as a chance to stand up to authoritarianism around the world.,"LIVERPOOL: The G7 on Sunday said time is running out for Iran to agree a deal to curb its nuclear ambitions, and warned Russia of “massive” consequences if it invades Ukraine. 
Foreign ministers from the world’s richest nations held a two-day meeting in Liverpool, northwest England, seeking to present a strong, united front on key issues. 
On Iran, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, from G7 host Britain, said resumed talks in Vienna were the Islamic Republic’s “last chance to come to the negotiating table with a serious resolution”. 
“There is still time for Iran to come and agree this deal,” she told a news conference. 
The final communique from the talks said Iran “must stop its nuclear escalation and seize the opportunity to conclude a deal, while this is still possible”. 
Negotiations restarted on Thursday to try to revive the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers, which the United States withdrew from under Donald Trump in 2018. 
Iran says it only wants to develop a civilian capability but Western powers say its stockpile of enriched uranium goes well beyond that, and could be used to develop a nuclear weapon. 
US President Joe Biden has said he is ready to return to the agreement and Iranian officials maintain they are serious about committing to the talks. 
But Tehran has been accused of backsliding on progress made earlier this year and playing for time. 
Truss’s comments are the first time a signatory to the original deal has given an ultimatum for the talks. 
Britain, which hands over the G7 presidency to Germany next year, portrayed the two-day conference in Liverpool as a chance to stand up to authoritarianism around the world. 
As well as Iran, Russia’s build-up of troops on the border with Ukraine dominated talks, given fears of a possible invasion of the former Soviet state. 
Truss said there was “very much a united voice... that there will be massive consequences for Russia in the case of an incursion into Ukraine”. 
In the final communique, ministers unanimously backed Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, praising President Volodymyr Zelensky for Kiev’s “posture of restraint”. 
All options, including wide-ranging political and economic sanctions, are on the table if Russia ignores a diplomatic solution, officials indicated. 
A senior US State Department official on Saturday said “a large number of democratic countries” were ready to join the G7 nations of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States in taking action. 
Biden earlier this week held a virtual summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to voice Western concerns. 
He is sending his top diplomat for Europe and Eurasian affairs to Kiev and Moscow next week for follow-up talks with senior officials. 
Russia says the military build-up is a defensive measure against Ukraine moving closer to Nato. 
Pope Francis also called for the situation to be “resolved through serious international dialogue and not with weapons”, following the Angelus prayer at St Peter’s Square. 
From Liverpool, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken flies on to southeast Asia as part of Washington’s push for “peace, security and prosperity” in the Indo-Pacific region. 
Britain’s G7 presidency this year has been dominated by responding to Beijing’s alleged domestic rights abuses, as well as creeping authoritarianism in its former colony, Hong Kong. 
Ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) took part in talks with the G7 for the first time, with concerns high about security in the South China Sea.

10,Four killed in shooting at Palestinian camp in Lebanon,The shootings took place during the funeral of a Hamas supporter who was killed in an explosion on Friday.,"CAIRO: Four people were killed and others were injured in a shooting on Sunday in the Palestinian camp of Burj al-Shemali in Lebanon, two officials of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas said and they blamed rival movement Fatah for the bloodshed.
The shootings took place during the funeral of a Hamas supporter who was killed in an explosion on Friday night in the camp in the southern Lebanese port city of Tyre.
“Fatah gunmen deliberately opened fire against people taking part in the funeral march,” one Hamas official said, asking not to be named.
There was no immediate response from the office of the Palestinian ambassador in Lebanon to a request for comment about the Hamas allegation.
Fatah controls the Palestinian Authority that exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Palestinian Authority officials in the West Bank, contacted for comment, said they were checking the reports.
Earlier on Sunday, Lebanese state media said two people were killed and seven were injured in a dispute that erupted in the Burj al-Shemali camp.
Hamas said in a statement on Saturday that the blast on Friday night was caused by an electrical fault in a warehouse containing oxygen and gas cylinders for coronavirus patients, as well as detergents and disinfectants.
A number of armed Palestinian factions, including Hamas and the Fatah movement, hold effective control over roughly a dozen Palestinian camps in the country, which Lebanese authorities by custom do not enter.
In another statement, the Hamas group said that explosions that shook a  refugee camp in southern Lebanon were caused by an electrical  short-circuit in a storage area for oxygen bottles used to treat  coronavirus patients.
Later in the day however, a Lebanese  security official said that the explosion in the camp was clearly  ammunition not oxygen bottles.
Lebanons  state-run National News Agency had reported that arms stored  for Hamas exploded on Friday in the Burj Shamali camp, killing and  injuring a number of people. 
A security official also said the  explosions caused casualties but did not give a breakdown.
Hamas  in a statement described the explosions as an incident adding  that a fire in the refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre caused  limited damage. In a later statement, the group said that one of its  members, Hamza Chahine, was killed.
It called on its supporters to take  part in his funeral on Sunday afternoon at a mosque in the camp.
Hamas  said the oxygen bottles and containers of detergents stored at the camp  were to be distributed as part of its aid work in the camp.
Hamas  condemns the misleading media campaign and the spread of false news  that accompanied the incident, the militant group said in its statement.  It added that reports about the cause of the blast and the deaths of  dozens are baseless.
Immediately after the blasts, Lebanese troops deployed around the camp and briefly prevented people from entering or leaving.
NNA  said the state prosecutor in southern Lebanon has asked security  agencies and arms experts to inspect the Hamas arms storage site inside  the camp.
Lebanon is home to tens of thousands of Palestinian  refugees and their descendants. Many live in the 12 refugee camps that  are scattered around the small Mediterranean country.

11,Race to rescue survivors as tornadoes leave 94 dead in US,"“It’s a tragedy,” says President Biden, who pledged support for the affected states.","MAYFIELD (United States): US rescuers desperately searched for survivors on Sunday after tornadoes killed at least 94 and left entire towns in ruin, with emergency crews racing against time to find dozens still missing from a collapsed Kentucky factory. 
President Joe Biden called the wave of twisters, including one that travelled more than 320 kilometres, “one of the largest” storm outbreaks in American history. 
“It’s a tragedy,” a shaken Biden, who pledged support for the affected states, said in televised comments. “And we still don’t know how many lives are lost and the full extent of the damage.” 
With the death toll all but certain to rise, scores of search and rescue officers were helping stunned citizens across the US heartland sift through the rubble of their homes and businesses overnight. 
More than 80 people are dead in Kentucky alone, many of them workers at a candle factory in Mayfield, the state’s Governor Andy Beshear said on Sunday as he raised the confirmed toll by 10 fatalities. 
And the forecast was grim. “That number is going to exceed more than 100,” Beshear told CNN. 
Meanwhile, at least six died in an Amazon warehouse in Illinois where they were on the night shift processing orders ahead of Christmas. 
Emergency crews worked through the night into Sunday at both locations, but the Kentucky governor’s sombre remarks suggested his state’s residents should brace for the worst. 
Of the 110 employees working on Friday night in the candle factory, “about 40 have been rescued and I’m not sure we’re going to see another rescue,” Beshear said. “I pray for it,” he said, but “it would be an incredible miracle” if more factory victims were found alive. As Americans grappled with the immensity of the disaster, condolences poured in, with Pope Francis saying he is praying “for the victims of the tornado that hit Kentucky”. 
Biden’s Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin, in a break from tense bilateral relations, said his country “shares in the grief” of those who lost loved ones and expressed hope that victims quickly overcome the tornadoes’ consequences. The catastrophe has shaken many Americans, including officials who have worked in the aftermath of tornadoes and other big storms. 
“This event is the worst, most devastating, most deadly tornado event in Kentucky’s history,” Beshear said on Saturday, adding he feared “we will have lost more than 100 people”. 
“The devastation is unlike anything I have seen in my life, and I have trouble putting it into words.” 
The largest tornado among the swarm that smashed through the US South and Midwest had rumbled along the ground for over 320km, Beshear said, one of the longest on record. 
The western Kentucky town of Mayfield was reduced to “matchsticks”, its mayor Kathy O’Nan said. 
“There’s always hope” for survivors among the missing, O’Nan told NBC on Sunday. “We hope for a miracle in the days to come.” 
The town of 10,000 was described as “ground zero” by officials, and appeared post-apocalyptic: city blocks levelled; historic homes and buildings beaten down to their slabs; tree trunks stripped of their branches; cars overturned in fields. David Norseworthy, a 69-year-old builder in Mayfield, said the storm blew off his roof and front porch while the family hid in a shelter. “We never had anything like that here,” he said. 
In a demonstration of the storms’ power, winds derailed a 27-car train near Earlington, Kentucky, one car was blown 75 yards up a hill and another landed on a house. No one was hurt. 
Reports put the total number of tornadoes across the region at around 30. At least 14 people were killed in other storm-hit states, including six at the Amazon facility in Illinois.
