0,Drive to enforce vaccination regime in transport sector picks up pace,The campaign started on December 8 and will continue till the 18th of the current month.,"• Over 12,000 inspections conducted
• Efforts on to inoculate staff, passengers
• Pandemic likely to halt two decades of progress towards Universal Health Coverage    
ISLAMABAD: The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Sunday claimed that a total of 12,073 inspections were conducted, 172 vehicles impounded and 37 arrests made across the country under its campaign to ensure observance of the mandatory vaccination regime in the transport sector.
Inspections were carried out as part of a special drive being undertaken by all federating units through joint monitoring teams (JMTs) to implement the obligatory vaccination regime in the transport sector. The campaign started on Dec 8 and will continue till the 18th of the current month.
The NCOC stated that the JMTs had been mandated to check all types of public and private intercity/intra-city transport at entry and exit points, bus stands/terminals, toll plazas, interchanges, rest areas and inter-provincial boundary on the national highways and motorways.
“Only vaccinated individuals and those carrying medical exemption certificates will be allowed to travel,” the forum said in a statement.
It said efforts would be made to inoculate unvaccinated vehicle staff/passengers on the spot through the mobile vaccination team (MVT), adding that areas that had been inspected for implementation of the obligatory regime were Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Lodhran, Okara, Keamari, Hafizabad, Lahore, Kasur, Multan, Jhelum and Shahkot.
On the other hand, seven patients succumbed to Covid-19 and 288 more tested positive for the virus during the last 24 hours, the NCOC data said.
The number of active cases as of Dec 12 was recorded at 9,118 out of which 773 were hospitalised.
Half billion people in extreme poverty
New evidence compiled by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and World Bank shows that the Covid-19 pandemic is likely to halt two decades of global progress towards the Universal Health Coverage.
The organisations also revealed that more than half a billion people were being pushed into extreme poverty because they had to pay for health services out of their own pockets.
Moreover, financial hardship is likely to become intense as poverty grows, incomes fall and governments face tighter fiscal constraints.
According to a statement, the findings are contained in two complementary reports launched on the Universal Health Coverage Day, highlighting the devastating impact of Covid-19 on people’s ability to obtain healthcare and pay for it.
In 2020, the pandemic disrupted health services and stretched countries’ health systems beyond their limits as they struggled to deal with the impact of Covid-19.
As a result, for example, immunisation coverage dropped for the first time in 10 years and deaths from TB and malaria increased.
The pandemic also triggered the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it increasingly difficult for people to pay for care. 
Even before the pandemic, half a billion people were being pushed (or pushed still further) into extreme poverty because of payments they made for healthcare. The organisations expect that the number is now considerably higher.
“There is no time to spare,” said WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, adding that “all governments must immediately resume and accelerate efforts to ensure every one of their citizens can access health services without fear of the financial consequences.”
“This means strengthening public spending on health and social support and increasing their focus on primary healthcare systems that can provide essential care close to home,” he said.
Mr Ghebreyesus said prior to the pandemic, many countries had made progress.
“But it was not robust enough; this time we must build health systems that are strong enough to withstand shocks, such as the next pandemic, and stay on course towards universal health coverage,” he added.
The new WHO/World Bank reports also warn that financial hardship is likely to become more intense as poverty grows, incomes fall and governments face tighter fiscal constraints.
“Even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, almost one billion people were spending more than 10 per cent of their household budget on health,” said Juan Pablo Uribe, Global Director for Health, Nutrition and Population, World Bank. 
“This is not acceptable, especially 
since the poorest people are hit hardest. Within a constrained fiscal space, governments will have to make tough choices to protect and increase health budgets,” he added.
Together, these two new reports offer both a warning and guideposts to all countries as they strive to build back better from Covid-19 and keep their populations safe, healthy and financially secure.

1,"PIA flight diverted twice, scaring passengers",Passengers criticise the government and the airline management for causing inconvenience to them.,"RAWALPINDI: More than 140 passengers refused to travel by a Pakis­tan International Airlines’ (PIA) Karachi-bound flight on Sunday after its pilot made two attempts to continue the journey but was forced to return to Islamabad owing to a technical fault with the aircraft.
Finally, the national flag carrier’s flight PK-301, an Airbus A320, took off for Karachi for the third time at around 5.30pm with only 17 passengers on board.
The passengers had an exchange of words with the crew members and a Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) provincial leader onboard, and criticised the government and the airline management for causing inconvenience to them.
Passengers were nervous and furious while the PIA staff kept insisting there was nothing wrong with the aircraft.

Over 140 of the 160 people on board refuse to travel

According to sources, Captain Amjad Malik operating the plane from Islamabad to Karachi took off at the scheduled time of 12.30pm on Sunday with 160 passengers on board, but he was forced to return after half an hour when the plane’s inertial navigation system — a device that can precisely guide an aircraft without any reference to the ground — developed some problem.
Unconfirmed sources said that the plane had to return to Islamabad after developing “a trouble in the engine”.
The captain safely landed the plane at the Islamabad International Airport, where engineers tried to rectify the problem. However, an interesting situation developed when the captain disappeared after disembarking. After some time, he was located by the airline’s officials. The captain then made another attempt to take off the plane at around 4pm.
Again, the flight was diverted back to Islamabad as the fault could not be removed. It created panic among the passengers who demanded the crew members to open the doors to disembark them, as most of them were not willing to continue their journey.
At this stage, the passengers protested and had an exchange of words with the crew members and the PTI leader. They forced the crew members to open the doors to allow them to disembark.
The engineers were again called to recheck the problem, but they insisted that the issue had been rectified and the captain was in stress.
A video posted on social media showed some passengers arguing with crew members and thanking God for a safe landing. “We thanked God for blessing us with new life,” said the passengers.
A spokesman for PIA, Abdullah Hafeez Khan, said the flight had landed at Islamabad airport for the second time because the captain deci­ded to return back due to safety concerns. “We apologise for the inconvenience caused to the passengers,” he said. “There is no compromise on precautionary measures.” 
After maintenance, the plane departed for its destination and safely landed at Jinnah International Airport at around 7.15pm.

2,Pulse imports slow down as prices surge,Impact visible on wholesale and retail rates across the country,"KARACHI: Importers have substantially slowed down placing pulse orders as global prices have surged by $100 to $600 per tonne over the past two months, pushing up the wholesale rates in the local market. 
Karachi Wholesale Grocers Association (KWGA) chairman Rauf Ibrahim said importers were reluctant to open letters of credit in view of the rising global prices, rupee’s massive devaluation and skyrocketing freight charges. 
The impact of rising wholesale prices was also visible in retail rates of pulses all over the country. According to the Sensitive Price Indicator for the week ending Dec 9, masoor, gram pulse and mash rates went up by 2.32-3.29 per cent over the preceding week. 
Masoor was selling at Rs170-230 per kg, moong at Rs115-230, mash at Rs200-310 and gram pulse at Rs124-200 per kg. 

Impact visible on wholesale and retail rates across the country

The KWGA chairman said mash pulse rate in the global market had soared to $1,060 per tonne from $800 over the last two months, followed by black gram (to $700 from $600), masoor (to $965 from $600), medium sized white gram (to $1,000 from $550) and large sized white gram (to $1,400 from $850). 
He said moong imports had been negligible due to local crop which started from July. However, the price of locally produced moong also rose to Rs4,600 per 40kg from Rs3,500. 
He said the wholesale price of mash had gone up to Rs250 per kg from Rs190 in the last two months, while black gram price is now tagged at Rs160 compared to Rs130 per kg. Masoor rate rose to Rs195 per kg from Rs140, whereas the prices of medium and big sized white gram surged to Rs160 and Rs260 from Rs110 and Rs180.
Pakistan consumes 800,000 tonnes of whole black gram every year which is later processed into gram pulse (dal chana). Consumption of moong, mash and masoor stands at Rs200,000 tonnes each annually, while the demand for arhar pulse hovers around 25,000 tonnes. 
Mr Ibrahim said imports from various countries made up 80pc of the overall demand for pulses, which arrived in the whole form and were later processed in mills located in Sindh and Punjab. White gram is not processed and consumed directly. 
After an upsurge, imports of pulses had been slowing down over the last few months, he said. 
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data showed that 86,033 tonnes of pulses were imported in October against 109,962 tonnes in September. Mr Ibrahim claimed that imports in November plunged to 38,000 tonnes, while arrivals from Dec 1 to 11 stood at just 11,800 tonnes. 
When asked why imports in July-October rose to 419,626 tonnes from 374,836 tonnes a year ago, he said this was because of previous orders as shipments had been taking at least three months to arrive due to logistics issues compared to 30 to 45 days a few months back.
He said there should be some mechanism as import permits should be issued to the traders as per the demand and supply situation of pulses in the country. Another option is that the government should get involved in importing pulses as per the country’s requirement or announce a subsidy on imports to control rates.

4,Fissures appear in PTI’s AJK chapter,Over a dozen PTI members stayed away from a luncheon meeting hosted by AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood in their honour.,"MUZAFFARABAD: Friction in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) became more visible on Sunday after more than a dozen members of the parliamentary party stayed away from a luncheon meeting hosted by AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood in their honour at his camp office in Kashmir House Islamabad.
According to Sardar Imtiaz, an adviser to the AJK president, invitation for the meet was extended on behalf of the presidency by him and some lawmakers to 30 parliamentary party members, leaving out the remaining two members — Prime Minister Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and senior minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.
However, the names of the attendees mentioned in a press release, issued by the president’s office, made it clear that only 17 had accepted the invite while Speaker Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, Deputy Speaker Riaz Gujjar and 11 others, including five ministers and three advisers, had kept themselves away.
According to the press release, the parliamentary party members apprised the president of their problems in their constituencies and departments. They also complained that the “prime minister was not holding consultations with them and was rather ignoring them in matters related to their respective constituencies”.
Underlining the need for improving overall performance, President Mahmood observed that “…neither the government has been able to create goodwill among the masses nor our workers are satisfied with it”. 
While exhorting everyone to fulfil his duties to bring about improvement, he said without mincing words that it was particularly binding upon the AJK prime minister to carry out his responsibilities for the much-needed improvement so that the government could make headway in accordance with the vision of PTI chairman and Prime Minister Imran Khan.

5,FIA digs deep into cyberattack on NBP,"FIA DG Dr Sanaullah Abbasi says the agency received 75,356 complaints about cybercrime this year.","DADU: The Federal Inves­tigation Agency (FIA) has started digging deep into cyberattacks on different organisations, particularly banks, with an improved focus on cybercrime that resulted in the arrest of as many as 1,160 suspects this year.
FIA Director General Dr Sanaullah Abbasi expressed these views while speaking to Dawn during his visit to FIA zones in Sindh on Sunday. 
The FIA DG, in response to a question, said the agency was investigating the cyberattack on the National Bank of Pakistan, as all stakeholders agreed that it came under FIA’s domain. 
The NBP, despite being hit by a cyberattack in the end of October, has not lodged a formal complaint, according to sources. 

DG says 75,356 complaints received in a year

Asked if the FIA faced resistance from the bank, Dr Abbasi said that when he talked to top officials of the NBP and State Bank of Pakistan, they all agreed that the cyberattack on the bank came under FIA’s domain. 
About its ongoing operations against cybercrime and money laundering, the FIA DG said that only this year the agency had received 75,356 complaints about cybercrime, indicating the gigantic challenge that it had to meet despite staff shortage. He said 14,757 inquiries were initiated, 1,083 cases registered and 1,160 suspects arrested. He said the cases were being pursued in courts, with the result that 28 of the suspects had already been convicted. 
Similarly, he added, the FIA had registered 911 money laundering cases and arrested 1,025 suspects since 2017. He said that 197 of the suspects had already been convicted and more than Rs5.3 billion seized as case property in these matters. 
Responding to a question about illegal foreign exchange dealers, Dr Abbasi said the FIA had in crackdowns on the operators arrested 60 suspects and recovered local and foreign currencies worth Rs263.128 million. 
While taking actions against illegal holding of Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) assets, the FIA retrieved 13 properties worth more than Rs2 billion, he said, adding that 17 persons were booked and arrested for illegally holding the ETPB assets. The FIA DG confirmed to Dawn that properties worth billions of rupees had been handed over to the ETPB. Besides, he said, 59 other cases of evacuee property were also under investigation. 
The FIA DG during his two-day visit to Sindh reviewed progress of inquiries and complaints in different matters related with Nawabshah, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana and Karachi zones. 
When asked about the shortage of staff and resources in the FIA to handle tens of thousands of complaints, Dr Abbasi said the recruitment process had already been started while the federal agency had been directed to take services of police, customs and other departments on a need basis. 
He disclosed that the FIA had received 1.1 million applications for 1,100 vacant positions. After an agreement with Virtual University, the FIA was confident that it would be completed soon. 
He said physical test of the candidates had been conducted, while the university was going to conduct exams of the candidates. Dr Abbasi said the prime focus of the FIA was cybercrime, besides money laundering. 
The FIA DG earlier chaired a meeting of senior officers from the headquarters and all zonal directors. He also visited the FIA Hyderabad Sindh-Zone-II where he issued directives to speed up inquiries. 
Speaking to the media, Dr Abbasi said the federal agency had recovered a total of Rs20 billion in a year, while investigations into some major corruption cases were under way. He said the FIA was working together with different departments to purge the country of corruption.

6,No pressure to be accepted in Quetta video scandal probe: Langove,Says the suspects will be given exemplary punishment.,"QUETTA: Adviser to the Balochistan Chief Minister on Home and Tribal Affairs, Mir Ziaullah Langove, has said no pressure from any quarter would be accepted in the investigation against the suspects involved in the kidnapping and raping of two sisters, making their objectionable films and blackmailing them.
Speaking at a press conference after presiding over a meeting on the video scandal on Sunday, the adviser said the suspects would be given exemplary punishment.
He said Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo had taken serious note of the incident and a team of senior police officers was interrogating the main suspect and his accomplices.

Says law and order situation is not ideal in Quetta

He said the meeting discussed the issue and its impact on society. Police and other agencies had presented a report on the progress made so far in the scandal.
The adviser said some important decisions had been taken in the meeting about law and order and the Gwadar sit-in.
He said all videos and other objectionable material recovered from the suspects had been saved by the authorities to be produced as evidence in a court of law.
He regretted that people who lodged complaints did not cooperate with the police and other institutions. “Even in this case people who reported the incident to police are now missing.” 
Mr Langove asked the affected people to come forward and cooperate with the investigating team. It was the right of people to protest, but the police needed their cooperation to bring the case to a logical end, he added. 
In reply to a question about the Gwadar sit-in, he said Prime Minister Imran Khan had taken note of the demands of the sit-in participants.
He said the chief minister had taken notice first and steps were being taken to resolve the issue.
“We have implemented 16 out of 19 demands of the protesting people, while three demands relate to the federal government, which included stopping illegal trawlers, return of illegally seized boats and vehicles and opening of borders for trade.
Mr Langove said the law and order situation in Quetta was not ideal. “Balochistan is a victim of international terrorism. Hundreds of organisations are working here.”
Qadir Ali Nayal, a member of the Balochistan Assembly, Quetta Commissioner Sohailur Rehman Baloch, senior police officers and other officials attended the meeting.

Talking to a delegation of SMEs experts, led by Nasir Hussain, Chief Financial Officer, Chen One, Mian Kashif said furniture worth $2.78 million was exported from July to October 2021 compared to corresponding period of last year.
According to a press release issued by the PFC, the furniture industry had a big potential to dominate global markets with innovative designs and it could significantly contribute to exports, but it needed a package of incentives and facilitation.
Mian Kashif said unfortunately in past the furniture sector remained neglected. It needed special attention of the federal and provincial governments for the training of woodworkers on modern lines to meet international standards, he added.
He stressed the need to explore the international market for boosting our exports as there is a lot of potential in Pakistani products. He said the value of furniture export was very nominal but the beginning had been made and with an aggressive marketing strategy it could be doubled in a short time. The PFC chief said if the government supported furniture companies, the volume of export could touch $5 billion in the next five years.
He urged the businessmen to work extensively to promote local industry. “Pakistan is blessed with abundant resources and our people are equipped with the best of inherited skills that can help develop the country at par with developed countries.”

11,President Alvi directs State Life to pay to families of deceased policyholders,State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakis­tan has been ordered to pay a collective sum of over Rs1.6 million.,"ISLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi rejected four representations filed by the State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakis­tan (SLICP) against decisions of the federal ombudsman, ordering it to pay a collective sum of over Rs1.6 million to the families of the deceased policyholders.
The corporation had refused to pay the amount assured in the life insurance policy on the flimsy ground that the insured persons did not deliberately disclose their pre-insurance ailments at the time of obtaining the policy.
The president upheld the decision of the ombudsman and ordered that SLICP must fulfill its contractual obligations and pay the policy besides reporting compliance to the ombudsman within 30 days.
Shakeel Zafar Khan, Muha­m­mad Nawaz, Ghulam Yaseen and Tanveer Hussain had obtained life insurance policies from SLICP for the sums assured of Rs700,000, Rs500,000, Rs210,000 and Rs200,000, respectively.
Subsequently, the insurance policyholders expired and their families filed separate insurance claims, which were denied by SLICP on the ground that the deceased policyholders had pre-insurance ailments which they had concealed at the time of obtaining the policies.
Feeling aggrieved, the family members of the policyholders approached federal ombudsman to seek justice. 
The complainants contended that the deceased persons had no pre-insurance diseases and the insurance claims had been rejected unjustifiably.
The federal ombudsman, having investigated the cases, noted that the onus to prove that the policyholders suffered from some disease before obtaining the policy and willfully hid the facts from the insurance agency rested upon the SLICP. It further stated that the insurance agency must present evidence regarding the existence of alleged pre-insurance ailments and its knowledge on the part of policyholders.
The ombudsman observed that in the instant cases, the agency had failed to present any evidence or diagnostic assessment to corroborate the SLICP claim.
It further noted the fact that all four field officers of the agency had categorically declared that the deceased were healthy at the time of the issuance of the policy.
The ombudsman, therefore, ordered SLICP to fulfill its contractual obligations by making payments of the full policy claims to the complainants.
