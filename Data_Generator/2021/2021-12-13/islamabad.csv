1,Call to devise indigenous policies instead of relying on donors’ advice,"ISLAMABAD: It is high time for meaningful research, informed decision-making and formulating indigenous policies...","ISLAMABAD: It is high time for meaningful research, informed decision-making and formulating indigenous policies instead of relying on substandard donor advice. For too long, public policy-making in Pakistan has surrendered ‘thought leadership’ to donors.
Economist and vice-chancellor of Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) Dr Nadeemul Haque expressed these views while talking to a group of journalists.
He said last year, in October, PIDE had launched a competitive grants programme for policy-oriented research in Pakistan titled ‘Research for Social Transformation and Advancement’ (Rasta).
The mission of the programme was to develop local thought communities and establish a research network of academia and think tanks across Pakistan, producing high-quality, evidence-based policy research to keep those involved in the country’s public policy process informed.
Mr Haque said one of the objectives of the Rasta programme was to put the Pakistani researcher to serious work on economy and key public policy issues to accelerate economic growth and development, and improve society. He said it was important to understand what type of research would be more meaningful.
“It has been observed that people are used to acquiring hard data, conducting regression analysis and presenting some generic results, which are not always sufficient to inform public policy.
“In Rasta, we want applicants to conduct policy-oriented research that should not only find solutions to policy problems but also help to improve better practices and interventions by informing organisations, policymakers, and decision-makers with pragmatic, action-oriented recommendations. In this context, we want applicants to focus on real policy issues and questions, build their research argument keeping in view pressing challenges facing Pakistan, and use analyses as well as data to inform people and policymakers of Pakistan”, he added.
“We would encourage applicants to study complex socio-economic dynamics, examine development interventions, explore the interplay of actors involved in managing policy decisions, and review institutional development and governance issues,” he said.

3,Sustainability of nature-based tourism threatened: experts,"Soft loans, grants can help small companies restore businesses","ISLAMABAD: Sustainability of nature-based mountain tourism is likely to be threatened in the wake of the impact of climate change.
This was pointed out by experts during a webinar on Sunday who urged the authorities to take urgent measures for economic sustainability of mountain tourism.
The webinar was organised by Devcom-Pakistan in connection with its ongoing 11th Pakistan Mountain Festival, the annual flagship event to commemorate International Mountain Day.
Those who spoke at the event were Kuala Lumpur-based international hospitality and tourism expert Choon Loong Lee, Gilgit-Baltistan Tourism Minister Raja Nasir Ali Khan, sustainable tourism expert Aftabur Rehman Rana, Devcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed and agricultural expert Azhar Qureshi.

Soft loans, grants can help small companies restore businesses

The speakers stressed on the need to shift towards contemporary and innovative business models. Mountain cultural festivals, visits to heritage sites, mountain biking competitions and jeep rallies will not work from now onward after the deterioration of mountain ecosystems.
They said Covid-19 had already shown its impact on mountain tourism, adding that the governments need to take immediate steps to revive tourist destinations for provision of consistent livelihoods for mountain communities.
Many companies engaged in mountain tourism have gone bankrupt during the pandemic and soft loans and grants could help them restore their businesses, they said.
Mr Lee said the pandemic had severely impacted mountain tourism by disturbing the supply chain while climate change had devastated mountain ecology and culture.
Tourism companies have gone bankrupt globally because of the pandemic and climate change while mountain communities, who are the poorest, need sustainable mountain tourism for better livelihood and living, he said, adding that relevant leadership, trained human resource and scientific data was missing for sustainable mountain tourism in the developing and least developed countries.
The other key challenge, he said, was the absence of required funds to support the companies and communities engaged in tourism.
Mr Khan spoke about different steps being taken to revive tourism and adventure sports in the province. Some policy frameworks have been in the process of approval where different stakeholders will be engaged for the sustainability of community-based tourism, he added.
Aftab ur Rehman Rana said constitutionally, the federal government was hand-cuffed after the 18th Amendment as tourism, sports and culture had been devolved to provinces. The Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation is trying its best to promote tourism and engage international tourists through the inter-provincial coordination ministry.
“Our mountains are the best tourist destinations in all provinces. More than 5,000 glaciers and the ecology around offer the best opportunities for tourism and adventure sports. Climate change is a big threat but adaptation and mitigation strategies will help in developing sustainable mountain tourism,” he said.

5,75pc eligible residents of capital fully vaccinated: DHO,Weekly positivity rate in Islamabad declines again.,"ISLAMABAD: The federal capital has become the only city in Pakistan which has partially or fully vaccinated 95pc of its residents against Covid-19.
On the other hand, 36 cases were reported in a single day in the capital and the weekly positivity, which had increased in the first week of the month, has again dropped.
In the district of Rawalpindi, one person died and eight people tested positive while five patients were discharged from hospitals.
District Health Officer (DHO) Islamabad Dr Zaeem Zia while talking to Dawn said that initially there was a target of vaccinating a million residents of the capital as the minimum age for vaccination was 18 years.

Weekly positivity rate in Islamabad declines again

“However, later the age limit was decreased to 12 years so our target was enhanced to 1.6 million. At the moment, 95pc vaccine eligible citizens - 1.52 million - have received at least one dose and 75pc - 1.2 million - have become fully vaccinated,” he said.
The data showed that on Sunday 36 more infections were reported in the city with the positivity rate of 0.6pc. However, the weekly positivity has dropped.
A document available with Dawn showed that in the first week of the current month (Nov 29 to Dec 5) over 29,000 tests were conducted out of which 261 samples were found positive and the weekly positivity remained 0.88pc.
However, during the last week over 34,000 tests were conducted and 230 samples were found positive with the positivity rate of 0.66pc.
Similarly, the number of cases was 43 on Dec 6 but it then started dropping and reached 36 on Sunday. However, a prominent dip was observed on Dec 10 when only 20 cases were reported.
Dr Zia said that the situation seemed to be under control because the residents showed responsibility and got themselves vaccinated.
“We feared that the trend may go up due to the winter season but it is a positive development that the weekly positivity has reduced. Now we are eyeing on the current week’s positivity to know if it happened just for one week or the positivity has permanently started declining,” he said.
“I suggest to the residents to strictly adhere to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) which include wearing masks and maintaining social distance. Those who could not be vaccinated till date should go to the vaccination centres at the earliest for inoculation,” Dr Zia said.

6,CDA prepares PC-I of two new parks,Ferris Wheel to be named as ‘Islamabad Eye’ will be 180 feet high from where the visitors could view Islamabad.,"ISLAMABAD: The city managers have prepared PC-I of two new parks, including a project of ‘Ferris Wheel’ which will be installed in Lake View Park.
The PC-I will be placed before the Development Working Party (DWP) of the Capital Development Authority (CDA)’s upcoming meeting for approval.
A senior officer of the CDA said the Ferris Wheel to be named as ‘Islamabad Eye’ would be 180 feet high from where the visitors could view Islamabad.
“It will be similar to London Eye,” he said. The London Eye is one of the highest public viewing points, which is installed on the South Bank of River Thames. It is one of the most popular paid tourist attractions in the United Kingdom.
A senior official said PC-I of the extension of Lake View Park had been prepared and would be placed before the upcoming meeting of the DWP.
He said PC-I of another project - Bhara Kahu Park - would also be placed before the meeting for approval.
Some years ago, the CDA had made announcements about installing a Ferris wheel in F-9 Park. Later, the civic agency said it would be installed at Malpur. However, it could not translate the announcement into reality.
“In the past, CDA’s financial health was not good; therefore, it could not move beyond announcements. But this time round, we have sufficient funds and will install the Ferris wheel in Lake View Park,” said the official.
Meanwhile, a press release issued by the CDA on Sunday stated: “CDA is all set to launch another entertainment initiative for the citizens. Pakistan’s largest Ferris Wheel with a height of about 180 feet has been planned for installation at the Lake View Park.”
Phase-II of the park stalled for over a decade is now being developed. The CDA chairman has directed the environment wing to submit the PC-I for approval at the earliest.”
Meanwhile, the CDA said a new park had been planned near Bhara Kahu in the national park area. This park apart from other features will have an exclusive section for women and children.
According to the CDA, the park would also have a walking track, kids’ playing gadgets, exercise units, a water sports area, a mini-golf course and a forest area.
CDA officials said the park would be constructed at forest number 8 on around 350 acres.
They said before the start of Bhara Kahu on Murree side, the CDA has over 350 acre forest land from Shahpur road stop to Bhara Kahu. They said this area would be utilised for the park.
Furthermore, the Pakistan Movement Park is being developed along Islamabad Expressway around the tallest flag in H-8.
The park along with landscape features will also have walls with 2-D images showing pictorials of largest migration of the history.
The press release said work was in progress and the park will be inaugurated on March 23.

9,Veteran politician pens memoirs on Kashmir issue,"MUZAFFARABAD: Justice retired Abdul Majeed Mallick, a prominent Kashmiri jurist and politician, has finally ...","MUZAFFARABAD: Justice retired Abdul Majeed Mallick, a prominent Kashmiri jurist and politician, has finally published his memoirs to the benefit of the readers eager to peep into the pre- and post-1947 developments in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir through his eyes.
Having turned 89 this September, Mr Mallick enjoys good health with a surprisingly good memory and still leads an active life in Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s (AJK) lakeside city of Mirpur, where he receives visitors at his place and also attends outside events regarding Kashmir issue.
Born in a suburban village of Dadyal he chose a career in law and practised it initially in Lahore from 1956 to 1958 before returning home due to family’s relocation in the wake of construction of Mangla Dam.
Back in AJK, Mr Mallick was deeply attached with the visionary Kashmiri leader Khurshid Hassan Khurshid aka K.H. Khurshid from a young age. When Mr Khurshid launched his Jammu Kashmir Liberation League (JKLL) party in 1962, Mr Mallick was appointed its founding chief organiser.
In 1967, Mr Mallick became JKLL’s secretary general and held this position over the next 11 years. Since he was also an eminent practising lawyer, he was inducted in the AJK High Court as judge in May 1978.
There, he rose to the position of chief justice in August 1983 and held it until his retirement in September 1994 on attaining the age of superannuation.
Talking to Dawn by telephone on Sunday, Mr Mallick said his family members, friends and followers had long been asking him to pen his personal memories about the genesis of Kashmir issue, efforts by the Kashmiri leaders for its settlement as well as politics in the liberated territory.
“Since my memory was serving me right, I thought I should not disappoint them and write my autobiography,” he said.
“I have put together my personal observations and experiences which also include some controversies that have not come into the open to this day,” he said, adding that he believed that a writer should be fair to his readers and set the record straight without bothering about the response.
