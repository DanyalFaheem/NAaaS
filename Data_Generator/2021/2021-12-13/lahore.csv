0,Central business district phase-1 likely to complete by April,Authorities trying to raise height limit of skyscrapers beyond 500 feet,"LAHORE: The development work on the Lahore Central Business District’s phase-1 is likely to be completed by coming April as over 80pc sewerage-related works were completed a couple of days back.
The phase-I will have 12 skyscrapers, each of 500 feet height, distinguishing Lahore from other cities of the country. The Lahore Central Business District Development Authority (LCBDDA) is presently in contact with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in a bid to take the limit of the building height to more than 500 feet to attract more investors, Dawn has learnt.
“The 252 kanal land has been allocated for the LCBD’s phase-I and 12 plots have been carved out for skyscrapers. Of these, five plots have been auctioned for Rs21.5bn—a record price so far. After auction of five plots, the development work at phase-I was launched in October,” a source in the Punjab government told Dawn on Sunday.
Talking about the pace of work, the official said the contractor had been asked to complete development work (except the underground areas) by April. After firm is preparing for launching the works related to roads, footpaths, lake, pedestrian passages, electricity, parking etc, he maintained.

Authorities trying to raise height limit of skyscrapers beyond 500 feet

It may be mentioned that Prime Minister Imran Khan had, on Feb 26, laid the foundation stone for the central business district at the Walton Airport site, claiming that the project would help the government generate funds to pay off foreign loans. He had called it an out-of-the-box initiative to create wealth, overcome fiscal as well as current account deficit and sustain the country’s economy, saying that the economic hub would lead to the construction of many high-rises in Gulberg and Ferozepur Road areas.
The total land demarcated for the district consists of various chunks of land measuring 278 acres while 122 acres out of the total land are situated along the Ferozepur Road. The remaining pieces of land are in the jurisdiction of Walton Airport and the Bab-e-Pakistan (Walton Road). All the 278 acres fall under the CBDDA’s controlled area.
After the auction of five plots in September for building high-rises and promoting vertical growth in the city, the planning for auctioning the remaining seven plots is under way these days.
The official said development work at phase-I was launched after the LCBDDA’s Board of Directors (BoD) approved Rs3.5bn PC-1, following recommendation of bidding & development scrutiny committee.
“The commercial zones (phase 1 and others) would have a mixture of the UAE and Singapore building architecture. The zones would be pedestriansed as there would be no room to allow motorists in the area. Operation of a tram service is also under consideration in the phase-I to ease mobility,” the official explained.
He said the business district would focus on water conservation by all means. The grey water (wastewater other than of toilet) would be reused through treatment plant. Similarly, the black water (toilet) would also be treated and used for the toilets, watering of plants, green areas etc.
“The parking is being planned to be kept underground. Moreover there would be several shops, food corners etc in underground markets,” he said, claiming that it would be the first commercial area of the country that would have 43pc open spaces.
To a query, he said those who won the auctions were making arrangements required for launching civil works for their high-rises.

Representatives of farmers’ organisations said on Sunday farmers were facing an acute fertilizer shortage in Sadiqabad. They said that various fertilizer retailers would sell a urea bag for Rs2,300 to 2,500, but would issue the receipt of Rs1,768 after taking a picture of the farmer with this document.
Similarly, a DAP bag is being sold at Rs8,500 to 8,700 against the receipt of Rs8,123. Farmers said their complaints to district and agriculture officials brought about no results.
District Organiser of the Pakistan Kissan Ittehad Jam MD Gaanga told Dawn the district administration had hoisted banners in the whole district that two bags would be sold against one CNIC which was not sufficient for a farmer who cultivated wheat on 10 acres.
He said in a meeting of the deputy commissioner with the representatives of Fatima, Engro and FFC fertiliser companies and main dealers, company representatives said the shortage of fertilizer was due to the closure of plants. Gaanga said the government should investigate the matter.
Sadiqabad Assistant Commissioner Kalim Yousuf chose not to respond. According to the deputy director of the Public Relations Department handout, the district administration was active to ensure the supply of urea to farmers. Also, seven hoarders were arrested and five cases were registered.
BAHAWALNAGAR: Scores of farmers staged a sit-in outside the local press club in McLeod Ganj against the artificial shortage of urea on Saturday.
Protesters said fertilizer dealers, with the connivance of the agriculture and revenue departments, were selling urea at Rs2,300 per bag.
Moreover, Kashif, Shukat, Ibrahim, Shabbir, Yaseen and other members of the Farmer Association (Kisan Dost) alleged that the administration would take action only against retailers while big dealers had yet to face action.

2,Bilawal welcomes 180 new entrants to PPP,LAHORE: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari welcomed at least 180 new entrants to the party at Bilawal House here on...,"LAHORE: PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari welcomed at least 180 new entrants to the party at Bilawal House here on Sunday. The new entrants are stated to be from the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, PML-N, PML-Q, Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat Ulema Pakistan.
Flanked by former prime minister Raja Parvez Ashraf, Hassan Murtaza, Shehzad Cheema, Aslam Gill, Ali Badar and Samina Pagganwala, the party chairman said that as the PPP had been founded in the Punjab capital, they would have to work hard to re-win the city.
Recalling the party’s achievements in the provision of employment and housing, he pledged to visit each tehsil of Punjab for direct interaction with the people. He believed that his mass-contact drive would be so successful that it would upset the rivals.
He vowed to hoist the party flag at the houses of all those who were currently with the PPP or had been with it in the past. “Whosoever has raised the slogan of ‘jiay Bhutto’ will be taken along.”
Bilawal asserted that the slogan of roti, kapra aur makan (bread, dress and housing) is still relevant in present-day politics as it had been in the 1970s.
He claimed that only the PPP could offer jobs to the people of Punjab.
In an apparent reference to the Sharifs, he sought to negate the impression that they had any personal enmity with any political figure in the province and stressed that the PPP was the only fighting for the basic rights of the people because “it does politics to serve the masses and not to rule the country”.
Those who joined the party included Alauddin Bahadari, Shehzadi, Afraz Abbas Naqvi, Hafiz Zeeshan, Nabeel Kazmi, Khalil Kamran, Haji Shakeel, Shabnam Sial, Toni Shah, Salman Arshad, Imtiaz Qureshi, Anwar Khan, Khurram Pervaiz, Rana Wasif, Jafar Iqbal, Sudheer Khokhar, Tahir Gujjar, Arif Gujjar, Ashraf Nagra and others.

3,Paramedics in Lahore await Covid risk allowance,Warn of agitation if not treated on a par with doctors and nurses.,"LAHORE: The Punjab government seems to be indifferent towards paramedics and other lower-grade employees who had been doing their duties during the Covid-19 pandemic at the state-run hospitals as they still await the payment of special risk allowance as promised by Chief Minister Usman Buzdar last year for their services.
The chief minister had announced during the first wave of Covid-19 in March last year that special risk allowance, equal to one salary, will be paid to the doctors, nurses, medical staff and others engaged in the treatment of the patients affected by the coronavirus.
Declaring it a glaring example of “discrimination”, these employees say the health department paid special risk allowance or Covid allowance to the doctors and nurses but denied the same to the lower grade staff of the public hospitals.
The Pakistan Health Support Staff Association (PHSSA) has warned of a province-wide agitation, stating that if the government continued to show apathy towards the lower health staff, thousands of these employees would take to the street, demanding their right.
PHSSA president Rana Pervez, chairman Hakeem Khan Niazi, Amanat Ali and other office- bearers also took up the matter of non-payment of the allowance with heath secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi in a meeting held here the other day.
Rana Pervez deplored the government’s discrimination against the paramedics and other supporting staff and warned it was causing unrest among them.
“We are giving time to the health secretary and other high-ups for payment of risk allowance to the paramedics as was promised by the chief minister and if our demand was not met, we reserve the right to take any step,” Rana Pervez said.
Amanat Ali said these employees risked their lives while attending the Covid patients and were still discharging their duties in corona wards and emergency units of the public hospitals during the 4th wave of the paramedics.
In many cases, he said, the critical Covid patients were left unattended even by the doctors and nurses, but the supporting staff kept on taking care of them.
He appealed to the chief minister to take notice of the “discriminatory policy” of the health authorities and direct them to treat all hospital employees, including doctors, nurses and paramedics, equally.

It arose as the human need of communicating with others who did not share one’s language was compelling. Co-speakers don’t need translation among themselves as what they speak is directly understood. It’s always meant for those who are aliens in the linguistic sense; they speak a different language. A different language invariably implies a different culture whose soul or soullessness it represents.
Diverse cultures have to interact and translation provides the most effective conduit for the travel of literary and cultural expressions from one society to another. In other words, translation is a story of cross-cultural communication and interaction. It’s through translation that thoughts, experiences and ideas of one society are transferred to other societies, which triggers a process of cross-cultural fertilisation. It helps a wide range of things such as trade, business, political relations and conflict- resolution, for example. At a higher level, translation of literary works has been/is a potent means to bring cultures together, facilitating the sharing of what is shareable in a specific culture. Great literary compositions have been/are accessible to the most of people because of translation. We are no exception.
Waseem Gardezi’s book of translations, titled ‘Rung Rus’, published by Sanjh Publications, Lahore is a good sign. Gardezi is a good writer and translator. The book contains a selection of world short stories translated into Punjabi. There are fourteen stories selected from diverse cultures, which represent an impressive array of celebrated fiction writers such as Hermann Hesse, Knut Hamsun, Naquib Mahfouz, Ernest Hemingway, Mikhail Sholokhov, William Faulkner, Franz Kafka, Joseph Heller, Guy de Maupassant, Aldous Huxley, Erskine Caldwell and Ray Bradbury. Along with the translation, we find concise biographical notes on the authors, carefully prepared by Gardezi. The notes serve a purpose of briefly introducing the great writers to Punjabi readers. The quality of translations is good as they reflect a serious effort aimed at conveying the original narratives of the stories in Punjabi as well as evoking cultural ambiance subtly concealed beneath the surface. The language is not far removed from the speech and its flow makes them highly readable without losing literary embellishments. ‘Rung Rus’ is an enjoyable read. Don’t miss it.
Dictionary is something we are all familiar with. Every literate person at some point of time needs a dictionary of his/her own language or of some foreign language. Language is a mysterious product if it’s a product at all; it is always bigger than what its speaker imagine it to be. Language never fully exposes itself to its speakers as it reveals itself in measures to each according to his need. And individual need is always immeasurably less than what his/her language can fulfill. Language has the capacity to grow bigger than what its speakers know it as at a particular moment. Subsequently, it conceals more than what it reveals. Dictionary is one of the tools with which we try to measure its length and breadth. But still even the most comprehensive dictionary of a language cannot grasp its full spectrum. By the time a dictionary comes out of printing press, language throws up some new words and phrases because of ever self-generating and self-expanding power of language. But still dictionary is what opens window to the secrets of treasure trove that language is. Among others, a student is the one who constantly needs a dictionary. Teaching and learning at school, college and university is hardly imaginable without the help of dictionary. Even kids need it to learn language and improve their expression.
Realising such a need Suchet Kitab Ghar, Lahore has published ‘Punjabi Baal Dictionary’ edited by Maqsood Saqib. The editor has taken help from Bhasha Vibhag Patiala’s Primary Punjabi Dictionary in preparing the dictionary in question. The dictionary gives meanings of the words along with their usage, which throws light on how words can be used in writing. For some strange reason, the prevalent alphabetical order has been discarded in favour of a new one but no convincing explanation has been given for such a radical decision. It can make the search for words time consuming and thus a hassle. Our kids are more comfortable with our Arabic-based alphabetical order.
“In this dictionary, the words are listed which school going children use or may use,” says the editor. The statement is partly correct because there are words that cater to higher level students. On the title, for example, we have Punjabi words ‘Ukka’ (totally, entirely, completely), ‘Ukka Pukka’ (total, all, in entirety, lump sum), which are beyond most of the children in the urban area. The dictionary is a good work that fulfills one of our children crucial needs, which has been ignored for long. It will be very useful for children, especially for secondary school students who are offered Punjabi as an elective subject. Schools must have it in their libraries. Your personal library will be poorer without it.
Have you heard of Bahawalnagar? It’s a sleepy boondocks town on the radar of a few people. But actually it is an interesting district sandwiched between two rivers, Hakra and Sutlej. Unfortunately, both have gone dry. The former died out due to natural causes but the latter was sold to India by one of our foolish rulers for a paltry sum. Hakra supported a vibrant society, which was a part of Harappa civilisation way back in time. With the selling of Sutlej came a fulcrum point, which tipped the future against the region depriving it of a vital source of economic activities, water. Defying the odds, it can boast of valuable agricultural production. Fortunately, the entire area has been deeply influenced by our giant poet and mystic Baba Farid at literary and spiritual level. Saghir Tabassum, a poet and writer, has attempted to capture the literary history of the region in his book ‘Asaan Chup Nahi Vattni Dharti Te’ published by Print Media Publications, Lahore. The book ‘is a historical and critical evaluation of Bahawalnagar’s Punjabi literature…’ says the author.
The fact is that it’s a history of poetry. Scores of poets have been included. Each entry has the biographic sketch of the poet followed by a sample of his/her representative verses. The book is a compendium of poems that deal with diverse experiences that evoke the ethos of a particular region. The book is a commendable effort. — soofi01@hotmail.com

The department is launching a pilot project in four divisions – Sargodha, Sahiwal, Gujranwala and Dera Ghazi Khan – in the first phase that will be replicated in five other divisions in the second phase, officials say.
Under the project, the extension service providers will be hired from the private sector and assigned duties as field force at the union council level, they say.
“The project for privatisation of agricultural extension services to enhance service delivery will employ ICT-based services and a command and control system will be put in place with the help of the Punjab Information Technology Board at a cost of Rs10 billion,” an official says.
Elaborating, he says that under the programme two field assistants will be posted in each union council and an agriculture officer in every three union councils to provide modern agricultural extension services and technical guidance to the farming community.
According to him, the public sector extension services staff will be deployed in the field along with privately hired service providers for a “healthy competition” between the two and comparing their efficiency.
He says the challenges of productivity enhancement, diversification, intensification, value addition without harming soil, water and environment are mounting and the existing field services staff engaged in multifarious jobs is finding it difficult to cater to the needs of some 5.2m farmers in Punjab.
Under this project, latest crop production information will be provided to the farmers at their doorstep through the private provider ICT-based extension, he adds.
He says a call centre for farmers awareness will also be set up under the project to provide them information regarding the latest crop production technologies, weather and market-related issues.

7,Harking Back: ‘The King of Lahore’ and other images of our past,"As we study Lahore, the city so adored and yet so ignored by us, we come across some amazing descriptions by the...","As we study Lahore, the city so adored and yet so ignored by us, we come across some amazing descriptions by the greatest western writers. Of recent, finally, local academics and journalists have started taking the city seriously. But let us recall the colour and twist of the great western writers over the last 300 years.
The colonialists, as even Europeans traders-cum-‘explorers’ before them, tended to paint Lahore as almost a ‘dreamland’ of perfection. Of the colonialists probably Rudyard Kipling painted a picture of ‘perfection,’ yet on the other hand he also ‘lamented’ its shortcomings. But more on that later.
For starters, let us begin with the famous lines of John Milton and go on to Thomas Moore’s 1817 poem ‘Lalla Rookh’, which are described as having a ‘pseudo-historic Mughal colour’. The poem is about Aurangzeb’s daughter going to Kashmir from Delhi and stopping in Lahore. The description of Lahore is utterly amazing, with a few lines worth recalling. “life in Lahore is a brilliant display of life and pageantry among the palaces and domes and the gilded minarets of a city where trades ensure it is a city of enchantment …”.
The interesting point is that Aurangzeb never had a daughter named Lalla Rukh. But then that is what imagery is all about.
The image of Lahore’s walled city as a secure ‘procession of a happy life’ is better provided by the Russian traveller Prince Alexis Soltykoff (1806–1859) in his co-authored book ‘The Punjab a Hundred Years Ago’. He writes: “cavalcades of horsemen and mounted elephants move through the narrow streets with five-storey aging buildings leaning over on both side. Additional colour is provided by bare-chested dervishes, bearded akalis, loathsome eunuchs and fakirs covered in ashes, yet in the windows stand barefaced females”. What could be more colourful? Probably this was the scene in the northern portions of the city opposite the fort.
The colour and mystic image of Lahore managed to slip into Western opera and exotic musicals too, with Felicien David using different classics for show in Paris’s famous Opera Garnier (Grand Opera). Outstanding among them was Jules Massenet’s ‘The King of Lahore’ which made him world famous as an opera composer. The play ‘The King of Lahore’ was staged in most European and American opera houses, and with time as the French musical theatre’s grandeur receded, so did the fame of ‘The King of Lahore’ fade. Maybe it could be resurrected as a classical Pakistani musical.
Amazingly, such an image of Lahore in various operas of Europe was attacked by the great Leo Tolstoy who wrote: “such an image of Lahore did not exist in reality, and all this was beyond the possibility of doubt. There never was, or ever could be, such a Lahore”. The world of realism brings down even the greatest of poets and writers when a master provides his realistic opinion.
It would not be out of place to recall the plot of this classic ‘The King of Lahore’. It begins with Mahmud, the Afghan invader, and the scene is of a temple with the population of the city requesting the deity Indra to save the city. The chief minister, then by the name of Scindia, appears and wants to marry his niece, Sita. The ‘king’ rejects the proposal and marries her instead.
The second act is located in the Thar desert, while the third act is in Indra’s heaven (Svarga) and is located on Mount Meru. The fourth act is in the palace of Lahore where Sita is in captivity and is begging Indra to free her from the captivity of Scindia, the newly-crowned King of Lahore.
The fifth act is where Sita has managed to escape from the palace of Lahore and the clutches of Scindia. In the end, Sita kills herself with a dagger and Scindia begs forgiveness for his wrongs. Reviews of the play mention amazingly colourful scenery and backdrops. It seems that later writers were influenced in their descriptive narrations by the play. It seems most descriptions of Lahore were based on pre-colonial images of the city provided by travellers and traders.
But among the leading writers about Lahore was surely Rudyard Kipling and his classic, titled ‘Kim,’ and his Lahore. Kipling learnt to speak Urdu and a bit of Punjabi before he learnt English. He recalled that his Portuguese nanny and Hindu bearer used to tell them strange wild stories, and once it was time for dinner they would send them with the caution: “Now speak in English”. He was then sent to England, as all colonial children were then sent for their education, and returned to join the newspaper ‘The Civil & Military Gazette’ as an assistant editor. Here his Lahore columns started.
Just for the record, in those days Lahore was divided into two sections, one was the ‘Civil Quarters’ and the other was the ‘Military Quarters’, hence the name of the newspaper. In Lahore, as a journalist, he walked all over the city and learnt matters most colonial officers were unaware of. In Lahore, he wrote ‘Confessions of an English Opium-Eater’, and this was located just next to the Wazir Khan Mosque, in the ‘Tambanwali Gali’. He used the phrase ‘chandoo khana’ and brought forth the hidden social evils of old Lahore.
But Kipling’s description of Lahoris is excellent for he writes: “They sit together, laughing, calling each other their pet names and descriptions that would move the wrath of the gods’. He describes the scene opposite the mosque in the square at night as “people sleeping like corpses”. The excellent novel ‘Kim’ brings forth all these images of Lahore as few Europeans could have understood.
All these and many more aspects of Lahore have best been described by Dr Anna Suvorova in her book on Lahore. As she is a scholar of classic Urdu literature, she has mentioned Iqbal’s ability to describe the Lahore as he saw it standing on the banks of the River Ravi near Jahangir’s tomb:
Fasana e sitam-e inqilab hai yeh mahal
ko’i zaman-e salaf ki kitab hai yeh mahal
But then the poet Faiz also described Lahore in his poem ‘Ae Roshniyon Ke Shehr’ written in prison in 1956. The translated concluding lines are:
“Just tell all your lovers
To turn the wicks of their lamps high
So that I may find you, Oh city,
My city of many lights” 
There is so much to learn about our city, and the best and colourful portions exist in the lives of ordinary people. All you have to do is visit them, talk to them, or share a meal with them. That is the lesson that we can derive from the observations of John Dryden, Thomas Moore, Jonathan Scott, John Hoppner, Francois Bernier, Alexis Soltykoff, H. Blavatsky, Rudyard Kipling, Pran Nevile, Allama Iqbal and Faiz, as also M.A. Munir, what to speak of others.
The point is to ask whether our schools and colleges, let alone our universities, teach the students of Lahore about their city? The answer our readers know well. The fact is that we know ourselves the least. The official lesson is: ‘Go to the shiny monuments and forget the rest, be it people, places, things or faces’.

The family alleges that the Saddar police are insisting that they will register a case only when the complainants will report the less number of robbers than the actual seven.
Seven armed men targeted constable Manzar Ali’s house at Mohallah Madina Town in the city and tortured family head Bashir, Dr Humayun Bashir, a brother of Manzar Ali, and women and took away valuables including cash, gold ornaments and electronics, besides warm clothes and blankets meant for wedding of Manzar Ali’s sister and even food items.
Dr Humayun approached the Saddar police for registration of a case and said he had been visiting the police station for a week but no FIR had been lodged. He alleged that Saddar SHO Muhammad Riaz Bajwa was forcing him to report less number of robbers than the actual seven.
The SHO did not respond to the call by this correspondent whereas DSP Headquarters Sheikh Ilyas said there was no such incident of robbery.
The family has demanded Chief Minister Sardar Usman Bazdar and the IGP to take notice.

Police recovered heroin from Muniran Bibi during a raid at Mohallah Islamnagar under the supervision of SHO Shafiqur Rehman. Officials arrested the woman and her two sons Babar and Amir while one of their accomplices escaped.

The district police booked ringleader Muniran under a minor section 9B at the Madrassa police station instead of the Mandi Sadiq Ganj police station for possession of 660 gram charas on Nov 26, while her sons were booked on Nov 28 for possession of 17.6kg narcotics-like powder.
A police official, while requesting anonymity, told Dawn that the mobile phone location and the CCTV footage installed at the house of the woman could reveal the facts distorted in the FIR against the woman.
