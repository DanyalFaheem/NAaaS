Addressing a public meeting in Sarband village on the outskirts of Peshawar on Sunday, PML-N provincial president Amir Muqam warned the government to desist from announcing development schemes as it amounted to pre-poll rigging, according to a statement issued here.
The PML-N leader asked the district administration and the police to not support the government in case of any attempt at rigging the elections. He said that all the opposition parties had rejected the results of the 2018 general elections on the basis solid proofs about rigging, and that was why the candidates feared repetition of the illegal practice in the local government elections scheduled for Dec 19 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Mr Muqam said that the ‘selected’ government had no concrete plan to overcome the soaring prices of daily use commodities, which had made lives of the poor people miserable. He said that the government had bowed down before the International Monetary Fund for taking loans, adding that the agreements were not in the interests of the country.
He asked the people to reject the candidates of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and take revenge from the government through the ballot.
Qari Zahir, the PML-N candidate for Peshtakhara tehsil chairmanship slot, PML-N former district councillor Rahmadil Nawaz and others also spoke on the occasion.

2,Samples of Covid patients being sent to NIH to detect Omicron variant,PESHAWAR: The health department has started sending samples of suspected patients to National Institute of Health...,"PESHAWAR: The health department has started sending samples of suspected patients to National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad to detect Omicron variant of coronavirus as psychiatrists say that some people, who have previously recovered from mental illness, relapsed during the pandemic.
So far, Public Health Reference Laboratory at Khyber Medical University has sent 71 positive coronavirus samples of which nine have been tested negative for Omicron variant while the results of others are awaited. 
The experts said that genome sequencing/Omicron testing was part of the international surveillance requirement under which every positive sample was being tested.
“The details of the samples have been shared on daily basis. There is no case as yet but we would continue to dispatch samples in accordance with the guidelines issued by National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), which is reporting to World Health Organisation,” a senior laboratory scientist at KMU told Dawn.
Meanwhile, psychiatrists say that the pandemic has an impact on the mental health of people globally, be it be due to the fear, isolation, restricted movement, social interaction, loss of jobs or loss of loved ones and so is the case in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where the virus has killed 5,889 people and infected 180,661 others.
Prof Bashir Ahmad, head of psychiatry department at Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar, says that those people, who are vulnerable because of their poor stress coping abilities or strong genetic predisposition for developing mental health problems, are the worst hit.
“Some patients develop extreme anxiety and phobia while others dip into depression. Some people, who have previously recovered from mental illness, relapsed during the pandemic,” he said. However, he added that the impact was more severe initially that faded as the pandemic lingered on.
“If we look at the available statistics, the impact of Covid-19 on mental health is not that huge as was expected in the beginning. Majority of the people coped with the pandemic very well, showing resilience and maturity,” he said. 
He added that family and community were instrumental in providing strength and vigour to individuals with Covid-19 infection.
Noted psychiatrist Dr Mian Iftikhar Hussain said that coronavirus had multi-dimensional impact on the lives of people. “It has compelled people to remain in isolation which has led to development of anxiety disorders, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, anger, frustration, suicidal thoughts and suicidal acts in the people,” he adds.
According to him, the virus has deprived people of jobs and economic activities which has caused unemployment and has further been perpetuating psychological and psychiatric disorders.
He said that the infection badly affected social activities and physical social interaction, an important ingredient of human mental health promotion. Children living abroad couldn’t attend funeral ceremonies of their parents, relatives and dear and near ones.
There is a global depression and economic decline. “The virus has given birth to conflicts, disputes among families leading to separation and break up of marriages in the families. Is has caused a lot of grief and bereavement due to untimely deaths of people,” he said.
Dr Iftikhar said that it adversely affected education of children particularly as information technology was not sufficiently developed in the country. “Its adverse impact on functioning of our institutions due lack of sufficient IT facilities and training in the field is huge,” he added.
The quality of education has markedly deteriorated. Due to the lingering on pandemic, the government should develop IT systems to overcome the challenges to the education and other sectors by the infection.

He alleged that public funds were being spent on attracting voters. He said that initiation of development schemes for changing public opinion was of no use as the people were no longer ready to tolerate the incompetent rulers. 
Referring to the prices of essential commodities and unemployment, the ANP provincial chief said that people were unable to afford routine expenditures of kitchen and education of their children. 
Aimal Wali said that PTI had not nominated its candidates on majority of the seats mainly due to the fear of public reaction. He alleged that the PTI leaders were violating the poll code of conduct and urged the Election Commission of Pakistan to take action against the relevant ministers.

7,"LG system to ensure basic facilities to ex-Fata people, says Jamaat",BAJAUR: Jamaat-i-Islami provincial chief Senator Mushtaq Ahmed on Sunday said the local government system will ...,"BAJAUR: Jamaat-i-Islami provincial chief Senator Mushtaq Ahmed on Sunday said the local government system will ensure provision of basic facilities to the residents of the merged districts, and called upon the people to support the JI candidates in the local body polls scheduled for Dec 19.
Addressing separate public meetings in Laghari area of Mamond tehsil and Memola locality of Barang tehsil, the JI leader said the local government system was meant to address people’s issues at their doorsteps.
However, he said history of local governments in the country was not that impressive as vested interests did not want the system to take roots.
Senator Ahmed insisted that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government was not willing to hold the local government polls in Khyber Pakhtukhwa, but had to do so after the superior courts issued directives on the matter. He said local body polls were being held in the province after a gap of over six years.
Mr Ahmed said the PTI government also wanted to hold the polls on non-party basis as it knew that the people won’t vote for the ruling party candidates over the government’s poor performance.
The JI provincial chief said his party’s nominees for the local body polls were educated, experienced and committed to serving the people.
He also lashed out at the government for putting the country in serious financial crunch. He said the upcoming elections would prove a referendum against the PTI government.
The public gatherings were part of the election campaign of the JI candidates in Bajaur tribal district. Party’s candidates and local elders also spoke on the occasion.

8,"PTI, ANP main contenders in Swabi polls",SWABI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Awami National Party candidates are emerging as frontrunners in the race for the...,"SWABI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and Awami National Party candidates are emerging as frontrunners in the race for the Swabi tehsil chairman slot in the local government elections though all the contestants have been making efforts to win voters’ support for the Dec 19 poll. 
The candidates include Attaullah Khan of PTI, Mohammed Akmal Khan of ANP, Rab Nawaz of PML-N, Imtiaz Zeb of Qaumi Watan Party, Malik Amanullah Khan of Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians and Noor Islam of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl besides independent candidates Asif Iqbal and Hassan Khan. 
Local political analysts say that PTI candidate Attaullah is a close relative of National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser. They said that now the speaker’s integrity was at stake because he had allegedly claimed that record development projects were initiated in the district and ‘he would give a special package for every union council in case the ruling party wins the elections’. 
They also referred to the people’s reservations, recalling that PTI ticket for National Assembly was twice awarded to Mr Qaiser and one each NA and KP Assembly ticket to his brother Aqibullah Khan. They said that now award of party ticket for Swabi tehsil chairman’s slot to his close relative was being questioned by the leaders and workers. 
The political analysts said that the activists who had offered sacrifices for the party felt dejected over the fact that all PTI candidates would belong to only one family. 
ANP candidate Akmal Khan hopes to regain the party’s past glory in the district. The area from which he is contesting election was the stronghold of his party till 2013 general elections. Political pundits said if the ANP candidates contesting election for general council campaigned well for Akmal Khan he had the bright chances to win.
Also, the support of former Saleem Khan union council nazim Muqarrab Khan and withdrawal of Ayaz Khan of Pakistan Aman Partyin his favour has boosted his position. 
PML-N’s Rab Nawaz is young candidate actively running his campaign, reaching out to the voters. He said that his big advantage was that he belonged to proper Swabi and had the support of former MPA Babar Saleem from Maneri region.

9,Political parties opt for solo flight in KP LG elections to gauge popularity,The Pakistan Democratic Movement has failed to nominate consensus candidates for the LG polls.,"PESHAWAR: Instead of striking electoral alliances and joining hands with each other, major political parties are going solo in the upcoming local government election to gauge strength of their individual vote bank for general elections 2023.
As canvassing for the local government elections, scheduled for December 19 in 17 districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, reaches a fever pitch, political parties have fielded individual candidates for top mayoral positions in 66 city/tehsil councils.
Pakistan Democratic Movement, an alliance of opposition parties, has failed to nominate consensus candidates for the LG polls. The alliance’s constituent parties PML-N, JUI-F and QWP are all contesting the elections as individual parties, except Peshawar where PML-N and QWP would be supporting JUI-F candidate Zubair Ali for the position of city mayor.

Pakistan Democratic Movement also fails to field joint candidates  

Still, the alliance members do not view it as a joining of forces under the banner of PDM. “PML-N and QWP’s support for our candidate does not mean it is an electoral alliance. We are open to seat adjustment with other political parties except PTI,” Jalil Jan, JUI-F provincial spokesperson, told this scribe.
JI and ANP are not members of PDM but both the parties are significant players in the political scheme of the province. They have also ruled out alliance with other parties.
Mohammad Iqbal, JI provincial spokesperson, said that unlike in the past, the party decided that it would not context elections in alliance with other parties.
“Elections, whether general or local government would be contested under the banner of the scale, JI’s electoral symbol,” he said. However, party insiders say that JUI-F had approached JI to withdraw its mayoral candidate in Peshawar in support of the former. However, JI declined, saying the party wanted to assess its own popularity graph by fielding the party candidate Advocate Bahrullah.
Political analysts see this assertion of independent identity in the LG context as natural for the political scheme of KP. 
The political dynamics of local government, they say, are different from national elections where the winning chances are improved through a closing of ranks in the form of seat adjustments and electoral alliances where a larger political party enters these to improve its chances to win. That logic, however, does not apply to KP.
“The LG elections in KP have to be seen from this lens where the local parties have their own individual vote bank and they do not need to mobilise alliances as in case of general elections in the entire country,” says Zaigham Khan, a political commentator.
“It is more a chance of mobilising their own vote bank, which an alliance would only dilute. Why would JUI-F, for example, want an alliance for a mayoral contest in Bannu, or ANP or PTI in Karachi where a (local) mayoral position is the prize,” he questioned.
M Khan said that removal of district tier from the LG polls was anti-parliamentary. The LG elections this time would be only contested only at tehsil council and village/neighbourhood council levels. “This negates spirit of devolution because after the province, the next stage is the district, not tehsil and village councils,” he added.
A source told this scribe that support of PML-N and QWP to the JUI-F nominee was not due to PDM but the two parties had no suitable candidates to win the elections. Besides, Zubair Ali’s father Haji Ghulam Ali, a former senator and district nazim of Peshawar, also managed to get support of the two parties for his son on the basis of personal understanding.
“PDM is in grip of JUI-F. JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman is its central president and his brother Maulana Attaur Rehman is its provincial chief but they did not bother to convene at least a single meeting of the allies to develop consensus for electoral alliance also,” the source said.
He admitted that the opposition alliance also lacked understanding and every party was attempting to find its own way out despite being in the alliance.
PML-N provincial spokesman Ikhtiar Wali Khan said that his party had also withdrawn its candidate Jan Mohammad in favour of JUI-F’s candidate for Nowshera tehsil council Qari Akhtar Munir. He claimed that his party’s support would lead to success of the JUI-F nominees.
He described it very difficult for uneducated voters to understand the voting process. He said that people had enough of the elections, which brought no financial relief to them rather wasted their time.
Similarly, QWP provincial senior vice chairman Tariq Khan said that in the prevailing situation, the best option for his party was to support the JUI-F candidate. He said that opposition parties needed to develop understanding to give tough time to PTI.
PPP deputy provincial secretary information Tahir Abbas told Dawn that his party had nominated candidates without any alliance with the hope to win the election. “Besides door-to-door campaign, we held 24 corner meetings in Peshawar with large number of people in attendance,” he said.
