0,"Extremism is affecting lives of creative individuals, moot told",Urdu Conference concludes,"KARACHI: The four-day 14th International Urdu Conference organised by the Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi, concluded on Sunday evening.
A resolution, read out by the council’s president Ahmed Shah, was also passed on the occasion stating: “Different facets of extremism are being witnessed in the country. It is affecting the lives of creative individuals and shrinking cultural spaces. We demand federal and provincial governments to fulfil their constitutional obligations and take steps to bring about peace in the country. 
“Curricula should be made keeping the plurality in society and the importance of tolerance in mind for the benefit of the coming generations. Scientific knowledge and texts should be given importance. Society should be deweaponised. 
“The government should play its part in publishing literary journals. Steps be taken for free education of children. Children’s literature be given the same status as other forms of literature,” it demands.  
After the passing of the resolution, writer Anwar Maqsood read his piece in his distinct satire-laden style. 

Urdu Conference concludes

Four lifetime achievement awards were also given on the occasion to poetess Zehra Nigah, writer Mustansar Husain Tarar, poet Imdad Hussaini and Dr Adib Rizvi (on whose behalf Anwar Maqsood received the award).
Session on contemporary Urdu criticism
Earlier, the day began with an insightful session on the contemporary Urdu criticism, presided over by Shahida Hasan and Anees Ashfaq.   
Rukhsana Saba, who also moderated the programme, in her paper raised the question about the meaning of criticism written against the background of civilisation. She said instead of writing criticism with western references, it should be analysed through the local landscape. Going forward with her thesis, she mentioned the names of eminent critics such as M H Askari, Muzaffar Ali Syed and Jamal Panipati.  
Qasim Yaqoob, who joined online from Islamabad, said Urdu criticism is often seen in the light of partition of India, that is, the one written before independence and afterwards. In fact, the first important book in that regard was penned by Ali Abbas Husaini in 1944. Subsequently, criticism focused on the initial days of the Urdu novel. However, he pointed out, “the novel should be distinguished from fiction”; the criticism of the short story (afsana) and that of the novel have a marked difference. Before writing on novels, the writer should take into account their ontological textures. The problem is that Urdu criticism is stuck in the early days of the novel. It is yet to get the right critic. “Life has become complicated in the 21st century and the novel, too, has become complicated. Yet, criticism is set in its old ways.”  
Sofia Yusuf said debates on feminist consciousness in Urdu literature began in the 1960s. Although male writers are credited with writing novels in Urdu, women had their share as well. It was as far back as 1881 that the first woman novelist came out with a book. Ms Yusuf argued, women in our novels haven’t been treated like human beings but are seen as relations (rishtey).
Kazi Abid said terminologies (istilahaat) are used excessively in criticism. It was in the 1980s that criticism in Urdu started to change its lexicon. What happened in the ‘90s was different from it. But from the discussion on narrative styles to postmodernism, all used terminologies were western. In the 1980s the poetics of creating a work of art was non-existent from critical analyses. The emphasis was on understanding the text (tafhimaat). And in the last 30 years, there was a lot of hubbub about structuralism. Its practical application wasn’t there. “For a 24-page book there is a 250-page book with its structural interpretation but for a 250-page book there is no 24-page structuralist analysis.”  
Nasir Abbas Nayyar said there is a difference between trends (rujhanaat) and movements (tehreekein). Criticism can be undertaken through many ways and have many approaches. Trends work with two major metaphors — time and origin. The human mind tries to get to reality through metaphors. Whoever says that Urdu criticism is written under western influence makes an insulting comment. This idea came about as a result of resistance to colonialism.   
Mr Nayyar said in the last 75 years there have been three main aspects in criticism: it brought about a new prose (nai nasr); reasoning (istadlaal); and it associated literature with the concept of a nation (qaum). Pakistani criticism begins from Deccan whereas Indian criticism from Banaras where names such as that of Kabir are mentioned.   
Summing up the discussions, Shahida Hasan lauded the papers that were read and said creativity is the real thing, criticism comes later.  
Anees Ashfaq, who spoke via video link from India, said Urdu literature is rich (sarwatmand) in criticism.   
Apart from that, sessions on journalism, book launches and a conversation with Arifa Syeda Zehra etc were held. 
Renowned classical dancer Nahid Siddiqui’s performance and a qawwali were the last items on the programme’s list.

Irfan Mahar was gunned down on Dec 1 when he was driving home in Gulistan-i-Jauhar after dropping his son to his school.
Acting city police chief Additional Inspector General Ghulam Nabi Memon told a press conference that victim’s brother-in-law, Ghulam Akbar, and his childhood friend, Wajid Jakhro, were arrested.
Flanked by senior officers of the Counter-Terrorism Department, he revealed that suspect Akbar told the police that the victim used to torture his sister. Besides, he (Akbar) had borrowed huge money and was not in a position to return it. He (Akbar) was promised a share in the property of the victim in return of the murder, added Mr Memon.
He said it was a ‘high-profile case’ and the police were under pressure to solve it. Different teams were set up for investigation and CTD’s Raja Umar Khattab made a breakthrough in the case, he added.
Umar Khattab said on the occasion that during the investigation, it was transpired that ‘family members’ were involved in the murder. “Their domestic and property disputes led to the murder,” he said.
He said the held suspect had borrowed Rs3 million and he was told that the debt would be retired if he killed Mahar.
He said the victim’s second wife had given cash to her brother for purchasing a motorbike and a pistol to carry out the murder. 
When Mahar was returning home after dropping his son at a school, the suspects intercepted his car, Akbar got off the bike and fired at him, he said, adding that Akbar’s son was also travelling in the same car, but the prime suspect was not aware of it.
He said that when Mahar left his apartment to drop his son at the school, his wife, Sahibzadi, informed her brother over phone.

2,Activists stage rally to highlight climate injustice,"KARACHI: The Peoples Climate March (PCM) was about marching for clean air, for water, for looking into the housing...","KARACHI: The Peoples Climate March (PCM) was about marching for clean air, for water, for looking into the housing crisis, for land rights, for an end to land reclamation, an end to demolitions, an end to forced displacement, and for putting a check on turning already dense areas into concrete spaces. 
That’s what brought out some 25 organisations and many individuals to the Boat Basin, Clifton, for a peaceful march to Bilawal Chowrangi on Sunday afternoon. 
They came with printed panaflex to support their demands, they came with handmade placards with messages such as Nalko main paani do (Put water in the taps), ‘Your greed, our death’, Tum karo tau development, hum karein tau encroachment (When you build, you call it development, when we do the same it is encroachment), ‘Remove weapons, private guards, tents’, ‘Housing crisis is a climate crisis’, Mahol nahi, nizaam ko badlo (Change the system to change the environment), etc. 
Representatives of the Malir Expressway Affectees Action Committee were the first ones to arrive. Hanif Dilmurad, Azeem Dehkan and Haji Azizullah Memon spoke to Dawn about the planned Malir Expressway. “It is planned to connect DHA Phase-8 to DHA City [on Suprehighway]. There are 20 old goths in Malir that will fall prey to the expressway,” said Dilmurad. 
“And not just the villages, even the historic system of distributing water to Karachi created by the British, the Dumlottee Wells, will have to be sacrificed. At least eight of the 12 wells fall in the path of this expressway along with the Samo Goth water pumping station,” he pointed out. 
The exploited affectees of the recent demolitions around Karachi’s storm water drains also came and demanded for their inclusion in environmental decision-making and policy-making that involved them. “We are stakeholders and it is required by law to listen to us along with the concerns of experts during hearings and before taking drastic steps in favour of commercial projects,” 
said one forcibly displaced protester representing the Awami Workers Party. 
Muneeba from the Women Democratic Front said that in this society women were expected to stay within the four walls of their home. “But where does she go when you take away her four walls? What does she do without a roof over her head?” She questioned. 
“In the name of development, the government is destroying nature. It is cutting hills, bulldozing villages to replace them with posh houses for the rich. It is dredging rivers for silt that filters the water. Thus it is killing our rivers too. It is taking away islands from the fishing community,” she pointed out. 
Many fisherfolk also joined the protest to raise their voice about pollution in the sea and the government’s eye on their islands such as the Buddo and Bundal. 
Appreciating the huge turnout, Dr Nausheen Anwar from Karachi Urban Lab said that it was very much needed. “It is an unprecedented and critical moment for climate change action,” she said. 
Environmental activist Afia Salam said that it was great to see the coming together of different constituencies under the banner of the People’s Climate March. “Urban issues are integral to any conversation about climate change. It’s good to see people making their case in numbers,” she said. 
Shahzad Qureshi of the Urban Forest said that it was about time that the people woke up to climate change. “We are already very late in climate awareness,” he said. 
As more people arrived and were assembling themselves to march up to Bilawal Chowrangi on the service road of Khayaban-e-Saadi along Boat Basin, some police mobiles started arriving and pulling up too. At first it was thought that they were there to offer protection to the protesters, but then they blocked their path and informed them that they did not have permission to walk up to Bilawal Chowrangi. The protesters then stood their ground and marched up and down whatever little space they had on the service road while chanting slogans. 
The joint demands of the 25 organisations participating in the march included an end to the demolition of working-class homes and villages and realisation of the right to shelter, the passage of a bill in reference to the affectees of Gujjar and Orangi Nullahs, the Karachi Circular Railway and Haji Lemo Goth with the same urgency as displayed to protect buildings and the affectees be given alternative housing of 120 square yards based on the household size in their districts. Also, ceasing the planning and construction of roads in the affected areas and land be returned to the people. 
They said that the Malir Expressway should be taken over to the left bank of the Malir river, which is vacant so that the agricultural land and houses of residents can be protected. They demanded a fresh survey for the project. They wanted the activities of the reti-bajri (river silt) mafia, which they say is working under the patronage of the government, to be halted. 
They also demanded the removal of industries from Malir and Kathore’s agricultural and residential areas as they are not only dangerous for Malir, but pose an environmental threat for all of Karachi. They wanted projects of Bahria Town, DHA City, Commander City to be stopped and their leases cancelled. 
They wanted the entire Indus Delta to be designated a Marine Protected Area. 
They said that the transgender community had been rendered particularly vulnerable to exploitation and discrimination when accessing their right to shelter and safe housing so they demanded that the government set up a network of safe houses and community centres across the city for the community to run itself.

3,"Civil society, business leaders, politicians reject PPP’s local govt bill",Some participants also demanded that the federal government take over the control of Karachi from the PPP-led Sindh government.,"KARACHI: Political parties, business and industry leaders, rights activists and members of civil society unanimously rejected on Sunday the recently passed local government bill by the Pakistan Peoples Party government calling it against democratic and constitutional spirit and demanded a strong, comprehensive and autonomous city government system mainly for Karachi and other urban centres of Sindh. 
They agreed at a ‘Stakeholders’ Conference’ organised by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf that the municipal organisations under the recently passed law would be ‘toothless’ and upcoming elections would become absolutely irrelevant for all true democrat forces of the province. 
Some participants also demanded that the federal government take over the control of Karachi from the provincial government. 
The PTI Karachi chapter organised the conference for consultation on the controversial LG bill that had been passed by the provincial assembly on Saturday. 
Leaders of Grand Democratic Alliance, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, Jamaat-i-Islami, Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan, Awami National Party and other political parties attended the conference. 
Sources privy to the event said that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) were not invited to the conference. The participants accused the Sindh government of taking over all municipal organisations, which was against the defined rule of Article 140-A of the Constitution.
The conference came with a consensus resolution that demanded direct election of city mayor, financial and management control of all municipal organisations, including health, education and police systems by the local government and its autonomy in revenue generation. 
Summing up the conference at a local hotel in his keynote address, Federal Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar warned the Sindh government to review its ‘feudal mindset’ before the people of the province take to streets against the ruling party. 
“Karachi shouldn’t be begging for its rights from Sindh CM,” he said. 
“We are here together and soon we would be again at some forum for a joint strategy. Because this isn’t a problem of any particular political party, it is about whole a system. We can’t just sit and see the exploitation of people in the name of ‘democracy’ or local bodies’ elections. The devolution of powers means you have to make local government responsible but at the same time powerful so it can deliver.” 
Resolution
The 11-point resolution passed by the conference rejected the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 and vowed a joint struggle against the law at both parliamentary and legal forums. 
“This conference demands all municipal organisations, health system, police and law enforcement system, environmental control regulation and education system under the local government,” said the resolution. 
“Similarly the local government should be made powerful so it can control transport system, building control management, water and sewerage system and solid waste management. The municipal body at all district levels should be more power and authorised that it can regulate and enforce all affairs directly related to local governance.” 
The conference participants also demanded financial autonomy for major urban centres and sought certain share and control on property and motor vehicle taxes collection. 
“To make it more powerful and effective, tax collection should assigned at each local council level,” it added. 
During his address, PTI Karachi president Khurrum Sher Zaman said that PPP had exposed its ‘dictatorial and feudal’ mindset despite assuring the opposition parties of strong and powerful local government system. 
“This new system will be a helpless system,” he said. 
“The mayor has been made subordinate to the chief minister. He’s not given powers to control even the sanitation and water supply then how can you expect that he under the defined rules would look after police and transport systems. It’s a black law. There’s no description of powers and resources to the mayor.” 
Former Karachi mayor and senior MQM-P leader Wasim Akhtar said that it took him four years to convince political stakeholders and institutions that the PPP was anti-development and anti-Karachi. 
“Now the PPP itself has documented this fact through this law,” he said. “This party which has been ruling over this province for last more than 13 years has never owned Karachi for a day. It is time for all true democratic and Karachi loving parties to get united on single point agenda — development of Karachi.”

But it had...","THE Indian Air Force’s bombing of Karachi on the night of Dec 8-9, 1971 was being widely condemned. But it had already caused a great deal of damage to civilians. By Dec 17, the death toll had risen to 71 and over 100 injured — most of them seriously in Bhutta Village which had a population of 75,000. Women and children were among those who had lost their precious lives. As many as eight bombs were dropped on the village out of which six exploded, causing death and destruction all around. Two unexploded bombs were later removed by the local authorities. 
Given the seriousness of the situation and nefarious Indian designs, the government set up some relief funds for those affected by the war. Countrymen from all segments of society contributed to them with compassion, empathy and patriotism. On Dec 13, it was reported that the day before a three-member deputation of the Karachi Hindu Panchayat, led by Dingomal N Ramchandani, presented 21 cheques worth Rs49,502 to the Governor of Sindh as donations to the National Defence Fund and partly to the Sindh Governor’s War Victims Relief Fund. Out of them, seven cheques carrying an amount of Rs33,000 were for the former support scheme and the rest for the latter. 
On Dec 16, another important and integral group of Pakistani society made an announcement: that on Dec 19 the Parsi community of Karachi would hold ‘Sehan Baj’ at the Fire Temple in Mahmoodabad, a ceremony which is held on very rare occasions — when the country is in a state of danger. They hoped that their prayers would help Pakistan and its people, and bring back prosperity and success to the country. Sohrab Hommie Mehta, chairman of the Karachi Parsi Anjuman Trust Fund, appealed to all Parsis to attend the ceremony. 
Then there was another aspect of devotion to motherland. On Dec 19, this newspaper carried a news item which said that to save the lives of soldiers and civilians who received injuries in the Indian attack, hundreds of men and women were donating blood at various centres in the city. A majority of them were students, labourers and office workers. Even teenagers were coming forward in large numbers to donate blood. Doctors faced difficulty in convincing them that their donation was not required, and that they would be called later when needed. As per the doctors, the enthusiasm displayed by the people was remarkable and even greater than the one demonstrated during the 1965 war. The staff at the blood banks, too, was working round the clock.
The young ones again made the headlines on Dec 19 when it came to light that a number of student bodies had asked the United Nations (UN) and International Red Cross (IRC) to take urgent measure for the safety and security of all pro-Pakistanis in East Pakistan. After a meeting arranged under the auspices of the Inter-Collegiate Body, the associations sent telegrams to the Pakistani government asking it to establish contacts with the UN and IRC headquarters in Geneva. They expressed grave concern over reports about organised goondaism and riots against refugees and people from West Pakistan.

The hint came from a key member of the Sindh cabinet, who however insisted that the passed bill had already promised all due rights to the local government and its representatives. 
A PPP delegation led by Sindh Information Minister Saeed Ghani met with the Sindh chapter president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Shah Muhammad Shah, at the latter’s residence. 
“We are still willing to further amend the LG law to ensure that the devolution of powers to the grassroots level takes place in the province in a real sense. We have already made the best possible recommendation. But things can further be changed,” Mr Ghani told reporters at a joint media talk after the meeting.
The PPP and PML-N leaders said they would not allow promotion of politics on the basis of ethnicity in Sindh on the issue of municipal governance. 
The PPP leader assured the PML-N that the Sindh Finance Commission would be made functional soon after holding the forthcoming local government polls in Sindh. 
“The municipal agencies have been made more powerful through the passage of Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill-2021 as compared to the situation in the aftermath of the enactment of Sindh Local Government Act-2013,” claimed Mr Ghani. 
Mr Shah said that the PML-N had always considered Sindh as a single entity. 
He said his party also wanted that the process of devolution of powers was completed in Sindh. He welcomed the gesture of the PPP that it was ready to further amend the LG law.

7,"JI, PSP blame PPP for promoting ethnic politics over new LG law","PPP’s moves are tantamount to legalising the politics of hatred and creating a rural-urban divide, says JI's Karachi chief.","KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) and Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) on Sunday agreed that the Pakistan Peoples Party government was promoting ethnic politics in the province that would have “devastative consequences”.
The two parties also observed that the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 would further widen the rural-urban divide in the province and ignite hatred among people.
The consensus emerged during a meeting between JI-Karachi chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman and PSP chairman Syed Mustafa Kamal at the former’s Idara Noor-i-Haq headquarters. PSP president Anis Kaimkhani and others were also present.
Talking to reporters after the meeting, JI’s Hafiz Naeem said that his party was willing and open to take on board every political stakeholder against the PPP’s policies in Sindh.

“The PPP always chants the mantra of the constitution but now it has attempted to violate the same constitution. The ruling party recently bulldozed all rules of business in the Sindh Assembly. The Jamaat demands an empowered local government set-up for Karachi. The PPP should have returned the institutions taken away from the local governments,” he said.
He warned that the PPP’s moves had been legalising the politics of hatred and creating a rural-urban divide.
Speaking on the occasion, PSP leader Kamal endorsed the JI chief’s thoughts and said more than five years ago he had warned that certain parties would again exploit ethnic politics for their petty gains.
“I see the LG law as a gateway to the politics of ethnicity and hatred,” he said. “We already have suffered a lot due to this hatred and divide. This law would revive it. You are not making a law, but signing a document to create new terrorists.”
He said that the chief minister had seized all the monetary resources and powers to themselves in a sheer violation of the Constitution and against the spirit of the 18th Amendment.
“Until the powers and resources are taken away from the chief ministers and passed on to the people at street level, the integrity of Pakistan will be in jeopardy. The state must stop the PPP before it’s too late. Sindh province is not the dynasty of the PPP,” said Mr Kamal.

The victim’s father Hanif Birohi forced open the guesthouse door after he came to know that inspector Pir Allah Bachayo, who was posted as SHO of Jhangara police station, was seen taking his 19-year-old son to the autaq of PPP leader Abbas Talpur.  
He filmed the disgusting scene, showing his son lying unconscious on the floor and the perpetrators — SHO, PPP leader and an unidentified man — slipping out while hurling threats at the shocked father.  
Birohi stated in an FIR he later got registered against the inspector, the PPP leader and the unknown suspect that his son was crossing a road in Shahbaz Colony where they lived when the SHO spotted him. He asked him to accompany him to the Talpur’s autaq where he and his accomplices subjected his son to rape after drugging him, he said.

""The desire was a result of myopic thinking and spoke volumes for ignorance of the opposition parties. The only thing they [opposition] knew was mud-slinging as they received applause over it,"" said the chief minister while talking to reporters at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh Bhutto on Sunday.
He said that everybody had watched the opposition’s attitude during the assembly session. “We have been working on local government bill for eight months and if we have still missed something we are ready to work on it,” he said. 
“We are a majority party in the house. Is it an issue then if we term opposition a minority,” he said, adding that they [opposition] were in the habit of using indecent and abusive language and creating rumpus in the House.

Flanked by Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, PPP Sindh president, the chief minister rejected the impression that decisions about Karachi were taken in Larkana. He was made chief minister by majority of members, he was therefore not restricted only to Sehwan, he said. 
He said that even though “we have addressed 90 per cent objections of the opposition” a group of political parties called upon Sindh governor and subsequently the LG bill was returned. The governor had no political role but if he did play politics they could not stop him, he said.
“In contrast, if we say something we are questioned by the party leadership,” he said. 
He said the centre had always blamed Sindh government or previous governments for all the ills but the fact was that the federal government itself was inept and inefficient to tackle issues. 
He said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government always played with peoples’ emotions by claiming that they would be able to control price hike within three or six months. People were grinding between two millstones of skyrocketing prices but the federal government appeared unconcerned, he said. 
Shah said in a sarcastic tone that perhaps intentionally the PTI-led government had not increased price of salt because it needed the commodity to sprinkle on peoples’ wounds. 
Earlier, the chief minister accompanied by Syed Nasir Shah, Minister for Local Government, MNA Khurs­heed Junejo, Aijaz Jakhrani adviser to CM, offered fateha and placed wreaths on Bhuttos’ graves and then presided over a meeting to review arrangements for the 14th death anniversary of slain chairperson of the party and former premier, Benazir Bhutto.

The PPP lawmakers and leaders, including MNA Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani, Gianchand Tharani, MPA Faqir Sher Mohammad Bilalani, Dost Mohammad Rahimoon, Nandlal Malhi and others told media persons after a meeting at Tharani House that the top PTI leadership was dreaming of taking over Sindh with the help of some defeated elements. 
They claimed that PTI leaders staged protest for two days in a desperate bid for political survival. The party leaders leveled baseless accusations against PPP leaders in their speeches but they had to taste humiliation after people started leaving the protest venues, they said. 
They said that it was indeed a very insane move by some rejected politicians to create lawlessness in Thar through the protest demonstration. They had nothing to do with the cases registered against some ‘criminals’ and drug pushers at certain police stations of the district as it was duty of police officers to not only maintain law and order but also curb social evils and patrons of crime, they said.
They said that there was no presence of PTI and other groups in the desert region. “The PTI leaders had time and again staged such dramas after having failed to get any response from people of Thar but now they stood fully exposed before public in the wake of failed show and baseless accusations of political victimisation of supporters,” they said and added that it was their last ploy to gain political mileage but they had to eat the humble pie. 
They said that PTI leaders, including Dr Arbab Ghulam Rahim, told lies during their speeches before gullible public and used foul language against the PPP leadership. 
They said that PTI had no future and those, who had recently joined the party, would only suffer humiliation and utter failure in their attempt to sneak into power corridors through backdoor.
They said that the PPP leaders had never indulged in dirty politics of victimisation but it was  Dr Rahim himself, who had tried to turn the desert district into  a living hell for the leaders and  workers of PPP when he was chief minister in Gen Musharraf’s government, they said.
