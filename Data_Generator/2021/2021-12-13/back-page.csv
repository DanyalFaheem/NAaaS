0,PML-N assails govt’s ‘fresh attempt to put Shehbaz in jail’,SAPM Shahbaz Gill says Nawaz Sharif and Ishaq Dar should return home to face court cases.,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) declared on Sunday that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) would not be deployed at the time of general elections in 2023. 
The main opposition party expressed fears the government was again trying to send Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif behind bars — this time through the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). 
On the other hand, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Dr Shahbaz Gill said Mr Sharif should answer the queries raised by FIA in the Rs25 billion corruption case against him. 
Speaking at a press conference, PML-N’s information secretary Marriyum Aurangzeb said: “Imran Khan does not care about people because he is not an elected PM; he believes the next elections will be held through EVMs and that he does not need people’s votes as he will win by rigging the machines. But the next elections will not be held through EVMs.” 

Nawaz, Dar should return home to face court cases, says PM’s adviser

Asked about the basis of her claim that the next elections would not be held through EVMs, she said: “Imran Khan knows people will not vote for him, so elections will not be held through EVMs.” 
The government seems to be adamant about introducing EVMs at the time of next elections and for the purpose it got the parliament to approve legislation regarding the use of EVMs in the polls. However, the opposition parties have expressed fears that the use of EVMs will pave the way to systematic rigging in the elections. The Election Commission of Pakistan has also objected to the use of EVMs in the polls. 
Ms Aurangzeb alleged that Mr Khan’s “fresh witch-hunt against Mr Sharif through FIA” was just another attempt to imprison the opposition leader on fictitious charges so that he could not expose the government’s corruption and incompetence. 
“Ever since being imposed on the country in 2018, the corrupt, cruel and incompetent Imran (Khan) has done nothing other than abusing government resources to monitor and persecute the PML-N leadership,” she said. 
The PML-N spokesperson said that even after putting behind bars former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz and other party leaders — including Shehbaz Sharif, Hamza Shehbaz, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Khawaja Asif, Ahsan Iqbal, Khawaja Saad Rafiq and Rana Sanaullah — the government had failed miserably to prove “a single penny of corruption against them”. That’s why most of them had been granted bail by courts. 
She claimed that Mr Khan’s “unholy” alliance with the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had failed to keep Shehbaz behind bars because the government had failed to produce any evidence against the PML-N president. 
“Imran Sahib, this drama should end now. When the NAB-Niazi nexus has failed, the same cases are being reopened by the FIA. The same questionnaires have cropped up again that were responded to by Mr Sharif three years ago,” she said. 
The opposition lawmaker alleged that there was no accountability in cases involving the government’s wrongdoings, in flour, sugar, gas and Rawalpindi Ring Road scams. “The government either takes stay orders or hushes up its massive corruption in the Ring Road, Peshawar BRT, flour, sugar, electricity, gas and medicine (scandals),” she said. 
The PML-N spokesperson said everybody should recall how the premier’s adviser Shahzad Akbar used to sit in the Press Information Department to “level fake allegations of corruption” at Mr Sharif. “Imran had formed a special cell to put Shehbaz Sharif in jail, but the courts granted him bail, compelling the NAB and the government to withdraw their petitions,” she added. 
Ms Aurangzeb was of the view that the government had checked each and every bank account of the Sharif family and searched its every business and every company but “couldn’t prove any corruption” against them. 
Responding to the PML-N spokesperson’s statement, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Dr Shahbaz Gill said the “thieves who remained in power for three decades are simply reaping what they have sown”. 
He was of the opinion that people had full confidence in the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. “Marriyum Aurangzeb should give account of the money of her masters instead of waging a propaganda battle,” he said. 
The “corrupt leaders who had plundered the national wealth” and went abroad for “bringing medicines” should return to the country and answer the questions put to them. “When will the then finance minister return?” 
Both Nawaz Sharif and Ishaq Dar should return and face the court cases against them, Dr Gill added.

1,Naftali Bennett first Israeli PM to visit UAE,"The prime minister said his trip “is aimed at deepening the cooperation between the countries, in all fields”.","ABU DHABI: Israel’s Naftali Bennett arrived in the United Arab Emirates on Sunday for the first official visit by a prime minister of the Jewish state, after they established diplomatic ties last year. 
The trip announced by Bennett’s office comes with Israel making a renewed diplomatic push against international talks which global powers resumed with its arch foe Iran over the Islamic republic’s nuclear programme. 
Bennett on Monday meets Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan to discuss “deepening the ties between Israel and the UAE, especially economic and regional issues,” the prime minister’s office said. 
Just before 4:30pm, Bennett’s office announced his plane had taken off from Ben Gurion Airport in central Israel on what the premier called a “historic” visit and “first of its kind”. 
A spokesman for Bennett, Matan Sidi, later confirmed: “The entourage of the prime minister has landed now in Abu Dhabi, the UAE, for PM Bennett’s first visit to the country.” Before boarding the plane, the prime minister said his trip “is aimed at deepening the cooperation between the countries, in all fields”.

2,US bill drops negative references to Pakistan,Original text sought to determine Pakistan’s role in Taliban’s victory in Kabul but the new text does not mention this reference.,"WASHINGTON: The US House of Representatives has dropped all references to Pakistan from a bill that sought to blame the country for enabling the Taliban to capture Kabul in August this year.
But this comes with a negative development too. Last week’s tragic death of a Sri Lankan factory manager in Sialkot seems to have increased concerns about the security situation in the country as the Americans become more secretive about official US visits to Pakistan.
The original text of the US National Defence Act for 2022 required the US secretaries of defence and state to certify before a relevant Congress committee that providing “covered support” to Pakistan was in the national security interest of the United States.
The amended version changed the text by striking off “Pakistan” and inserting “any country in the near abroad of Afghanistan”. Another reference in the original text sought to determine Pakistan’s role in Taliban’s surprising victory in Kabul. The amended text does not mention this reference either.
The act, however, retains a condition to probe the cause and effects of the US withdrawal. It suggests forming a commission to do so, with the authority to review the role played by Afghanistan’s immediate and distant neighbours.
Another indication of continued US interest in maintaining, at least, a working relationship with Pakistan came earlier this week when the Biden administration invited Islamabad to its first-ever democracy summit, held in Washington on Dec 9 and 10.
Commenting on the invitation, an influential Washington think-tank, Brookings Institution, cited two reasons for inviting Pakistan and not inviting Bangladesh, “which scores slightly higher” on the US democracy index.
“Since 2015, Pakistan’s score has improved slightly, while Bangladesh has worsened,” and another likely factor was the US “desire to balance India’s inclusion with a regional, if aspiring, democratic rival,” the report added. While India ranks in the middle tier of the index, its “scores on constraints on government powers, absence of corruption, and fundamental rights have significantly decreased” from 2020 to 2021, Brookings explained.
The negative impact on Pakistan’s image came from the lynching of Sri Lankan factory manager Priyantha Kumar on Dec 3.
Soon after the incident, a US Senate delegation visited Pakistan.
The delegation — which included Senators Angus King, Richard Burr, John Cornyn and Benjamin Sasse — met Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday and expressed the desire to maintain friendly relations with Pakistan.
But the news of their arrival, and meetings in Islamabad, was released after the delegation’s departure, apparently on US instructions.
The United States and other Western nations have had concerns about Pakistan since the 9/11 attacks in America. But Washington had slowly become less strict with the restrictions.
US officials had started talking about future visits to Pakistan at official briefings as well, although the schedules were never announced. But after the Sialkot tragedy, the Americans seem to have returned to their old practice of talking about a visit to Pakistan only after it’s over.
