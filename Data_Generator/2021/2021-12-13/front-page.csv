0,Amendments to tax laws proposed for $1bn IMF tranche,Supplementary Finance Bill may be put before cabinet this week.,"ISLAMABAD: With an annual revenue impact of more than Rs350 billion, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is seeking amendments to all the three key tax laws relating to customs, sales tax and income tax, besides the services tax law for the federal capital to meet ‘prior conditions’ of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and secure about $1bn inflows direly needed for balance of payments support. 
According to a summary about revenue measures shared with Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin for an overall briefing to the federal cabinet, FBR chairman Dr Ashfaq Ahmad has explained key features of the Finance (Supplementary) Bill 2021 for “achieving tax reforms with the assistance of development partners with the ultimate objective to be able to generate sufficient revenue for the state”. 
The supplementary finance bill, along with other fiscal adjustments, including Rs200bn cut in development budget and about Rs50bn reduction in grants to special security organisations, is likely to come up for approval by the cabinet this week. 

Supplementary Finance Bill may be put before cabinet this week

The underlying purpose of the reform exercise as pushed through by the international lenders is to “rebuild the tax system on ideal principles of taxation and without any distortions” as far-reaching structural and administrative reforms had already been initiated by the ‘present government’ to “achieve economic and financial stability through inclusive reforms and sustainable economic growth”. 
Officials said the FBR chairman had proposed withdrawal of certain powers of senior customs officers which used to be interpreted by many within the tax machinery as proverbial NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance) — a term used for giving amnesty to past actions and deeds. 
In terms of revenue generation, withdrawal of exemptions and removal of different rates under the sales tax law appear to be the biggest sources of additional tax. There is a long list running in hundreds of items that would attract higher sales tax rates and application of fresh tax. 
“Under the Sales Tax Act 1990, zero-rating under the Fifth Schedule is proposed to be streamlined and certain entries are to be withdrawn,” says the summary seen by Dawn. “Exemption regime under Sixth Schedule is proposed to be curtailed including pharmaceutical sector and restricted to import and local supply of essential commodities only,” it states. Moreover, “reduced rates of sales tax under Eighth Schedule on certain items are proposed to be streamlined in order to achieve equity in the tax system”, the FBR chief wrote. 
There are hundreds of items in the schedule on which different sales tax rates at one per cent, 2pc, 5pc, 6pc, 7pc, 8pc, 10pc and 12pc are applicable at present instead of standard sales tax rate of 17pc. 
“Likewise, sales tax on import of high-end mobile phones in CBU (completely built unit) condition under Ninth Schedule is proposed to be rationalised,” the FBR chairman said, adding that the “scope of Tier-I retailers is also proposed to be rationalised”. 
Under the Islamabad Capital Territory (Tax on Services) Ordinance 2001, a few notifications issued from time to time prescribing reduced rates in respect of some services were not consolidated, which is now being done in the schedule to the ordinance. 
The summary reports that “minimal amendments in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 are aimed at promoting digital economy, documentation and facilitation measures”. Additionally, advance tax on foreign drama serials is proposed to be introduced and slightly enhanced on cellular services. 
Disclosure of information in respect of high-level public officials is proposed in the income tax law in line with the requirements of the development partners, rule of law and integrity. Tax relaxations to real estate investment trusts are also being extended to their subsidiary entities called special purpose vehicles. 
“Under the Customs Act 1969, the power of collector to determine the value of imported or exported goods is proposed to be withdrawn which shall be exercised by director valuation that has been the case prior to Finance Act 2021,” explained the FBR chief. 
Similarly, the appeal against the decision of the director general valuation shall now be filed before judicial fora instead of Member Customs (Policy) in consonance with the principle of separation of judicial and executive functions. “Moreover, in the interest of revenue, corporate guarantee is proposed to be taken out as was the case before September 15, 2021,” he said. 
The changes in the Customs Act 1969 followed reports that through the presidential ordinance — Tax Laws (Third Amendment) Ordinance 2021 — on September 15, the tax authorities had broadened the discretion of the customs officials at the risk of massive revenue losses at the import stage. There were demands that these clauses be examined if authors were beneficiaries of the amendments to the customs law. 
One such amendment has transferred from the Customs Appellate Tribunal to the Member Customs Policy (FBR) the power to hear appeals against the decisions and judgements of the director general of customs valuation, enabling a customs officer to make, in his capacity as collector, underassessments of duty and taxes on arbitrarily low values and then empowering the same officer to finally uphold such low and arbitrary values in his capacity of appellate authority as member customs.

1,PM Imran assures Gwadar protesters of action against illegal fishing,"PTI Senator Abdul Qadir says some of the protesters' demands are ""unacceptable"".","• Rights leader awaits practical steps
• CM’s aide says release of boats not in provincial domain
• Solidarity Day rallies staged in Balochistan districts     
ISLAMABAD / QUETTA: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday said that demands of the coastal community of Gwadar were ‘very legitimate’ and announced that he would take up the matter with Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Abdul Qudoos Bizenjo. 
The intervention by Prime Min­ister Khan came nearly a month after the Gwadar fishermen took to the streets to press the government for their dem­ands including halt to illegal fishing.
Mr Khan vowed to take ‘strong’ action against illegal fishing by trawlers. “I have taken notice of the very legitimate demands of hardworking fishermen of Gwa­dar. Will be taking strong action against illegal fishing by trawlers and will speak to CM Balochistan,” the premier tweeted. 

 



 
While both CM Bizenjo and leader of the Gwadar protest movement Maulana Hidayatur Rehman hailed the PM’s tweet, the latter pointed out that the real issue was fulfillment of promises. 
A senator belonging to the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), meanwhile, told the state-run TV channel that some demands of the local fishermen were unacceptable. “If some of these demands are met, the government will have to provide such facilities to all people of the country,” Senator Abdul Qadir, who hails from Balochistan, said.
Fishermen in large numbers along with women and children have been protesting on the shores of Gwadar for past 28 days to press the relevant authorities for elimination of illegal fishing by trawlers, removal of Gwadar Development Authority director general as well as Pasni’s deputy commissioners and assistant commissioner, cross-border trade with Iran, provision of clean drinking water, closure of wine shops, jobs, job quota for disabled and free 300 units of electricity. 
Led by Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, Balochistan gen­­eral secretary of the Ja­­m­a­at-i-Islami, the protesters have vowed to continue their protest till the achievement of their ‘rights’. They blocked roads and other places by holding rallies and staging a sit-in. 
Adviser to the CM on Home and Tribal Affairs Mir Ziaullah Langau told a PTV show that the Balochistan government had already fulfilled most of their 19 demands and vowed to take stern action against what he called “illegal trawlers mafia”. 
Regarding one of the three remaining complaints, the CM’s aide said Maulana Rehman had recently admitted during a meeting that illegal fishing by trawlers had ‘declined’ though at the same time he feared a resurge in the activity if the protesters ended their sit-in. 
About their boats and vehicles that had been confiscated under the Customs Act, the adviser said he had informed the protesters that it was an act of the federal government and was “out of the domain of Balochistan government”. 
Speaking to Dawn, PTI Senator Abdul Qadir said some of their demands were ‘unacceptable’. “If some of these demands are met, the government will have to provide such facilities to all people of the country. For example, fishermen are demanding free 300 units of electricity, cross-border trade with Iran and use of non-custom duty paid cars,” he said before adding that people of Gwadar already enjoyed those facilities which were unavailable to those residing in other parts of Balochistan. 
The senator said some ‘anti-state’ elements were provoking the fisherman against the government in order to create unrest in the port city. 
The Gwadar rights movement leader also lauded the tweet of PM Khan saying: “We are not stubborn and believe in solution of the issues” though the prime minister took notice of the demands after their protest entered 28th day. He said the protest would continue as the people awaited practical steps to meet all the demands, which were very much legitimate.
He said the PM did not talk about some other important issues including opening of border, power and water issues and return of the confiscated boats and vehicles.
Despite official notifications issued by the provincial government, no step had been taken to fulfill those promises, he said. “We want implementation as our people are deprived of their livelihoods due to the restrictions,” he said.
Maulana Rehman had earlier said the protest would continue until the acceptance of two major demands — action against ‘trawler mafia’ and cross-border trade with Iran — out of the 19 demands. 
While hailing the assurance given by the prime minister, CM Bizenjo said the assurance was encouraging. He claimed that the steps demanded by the Gwadar rights movement, which came under the purview of the provincial government, were already being implemented as per its policy.
“Relevant provincial departments are ensuring prevention of illegal fishing and trawling,” he said, adding that unnecessary checkpoints and token system for border trade had already been abolished. He said licences of wine shops had been canceled in Gwadar and funds had been released for urgent solution to the drinking water problems as well as for the Gwadar old city development plan.
“Some other demands, including electricity, are related to the federal government,” the CM said, expressing the hope that the demands related to the federation would also be resolved with better coordination between relevant departments and agencies to curb illegal trawling.
However, to end the standoff, National Party Secretary General Mir Jan Mohammad Buledi urged the government to immediately hold meaningful negotiations with representatives of the protesters.
Rallies were also staged in other parts of the province to mark ‘Balochistan Solidarity Day’ on the call of Jamaat-i-Islami chief Sirajul Haq.
Protest demonstrations were staged in Quetta, Dera Murad Jamali, Jaffarabad, Zhob, Sui, Dera Bugti, Bela, Khuzdar, Duki and several other districts to press the provincial and federal authorities for the demands of Gwadar rights movement.

2,"Petrol, diesel output can be raised by 50-60pc, say experts",Local refineries have been facing operational challenges because of lower furnace oil off-take by power producers.,"ISLAMABAD: The domestic production of high-speed diesel (HSD) and petrol could potentially go up by 60 per cent and 48pc, respectively, leading to a significant foreign exchange saving provided the local refineries operated at optimum capacity.
The oil import bill, particularly of refined petroleum products, has been the largest chunk of about 83pc increase in imports in the first five months (July to November) of the current fiscal year, causing unrest among the government’s ranks, as money and share markets nosedived with the start of this month.
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin earlier this month reported that the biggest additional burden of $508 million, out of the total increase of $1.4bn in the November import bill, was on account of the petroleum group mainly because of higher prices. 
He conceded that there were fault lines in the government policy, as local refineries operated at low capacity and refined products were being imported. “This should not have been happening. This is a fault line,” he said at a news conference.
The local refineries had been facing operational challenges because of lower furnace oil off-take by power producers despite their extremely low storages than contractually required and large import quantities of both petrol and diesel by oil marketing companies (OMCs). Strangely though, the Federal Board of Revenue’s customs policy member, Saeed Jadoon, told a parliamentary panel last week that imports of petroleum products were inelastic and could not be controlled.
Data collected from industry sources suggest that all the five local refineries are operating at sub-optimal capacity. The five refineries could together produce about 274,000 tonnes of petrol per month with optimum capacity utilisation but were operating about 170,000 tonnes per month, almost 60pc lower than capacity. 
As such, refineries can produce about 3.3m tonnes of petrol per year but their cumulative production is estimated at about 2.05m, a deficit of 1.25m tonnes that has to be met through additional imports.
Likewise, the local refineries are producing a total of about 330,000 tonnes HSD per month, almost 48pc (or 160,000 tonnes) lower than their total monthly capacity of about 490,000 tonnes. Stretched over the year, the estimated local production works out to be 3.96m tonnes, about 1.92m tonnes lower than the optimum capacity of about 5.9m tonnes. The combined deficit production of petrol and HSD comes in at about 3.2m tonnes with an estimated cost of over $1.8bn per year.
The refinery data, which has also been shared with the government, suggests that Attock Refinery was producing 23pc and 50pc lower petrol and diesel than its capacity, while Pak-Arab Refinery’s HSD and petrol production was 42pc and 52pc lower than its capacity. 
National Refinery’s production of diesel and petrol is about 80pc and 108pc lower than the capacity while Pakistan Refinery’s underproduction stood at about 30pc in both products. Byco refinery was producing about 25,000 tonnes of petrol, 106pc lower than its 65,000 tonnes capacity while its HSD production was around 55,000 tonnes, about 45pc lower than its 80,000 tonnes capacity.
Mr Jadoon told the Senate’s finance committee that despite regulatory duties some of the big-ticket imports were unavoidable, such as petrol, whose import value more than doubled to Rs353bn during July-November this year against Rs174bn a year ago due to the international price factor as its import quantities did not increase significantly. 
Likewise, the monetary impact of gas also more than doubled to Rs322bn in five months against Rs144bn last year despite the fact that its import quantities had actually come down. The situation was not different for diesel and coal.
Last week, the Directorate General (DG) of Oil of the Petroleum Division warned of supply chain challenges and great financial loss to the oil refineries and state-run oil suppliers because of acute refining and storage capacity constraints, as the power sector backed off its commitments. The DG Oil warned that refineries had repeatedly been highlighting their difficulties that they were heading towards closures.
The DG Oil said the local refineries were supplying over 11m tonnes of various petroleum products a year. However, “due to non-upliftment of furnace oil, owing to limited storages, the refineries are forced to reduce throughput and close the crude processing which will affect the availability of all the other petroleum products eventually disturbing the already fragile supply chain”, he wrote.
The refineries had complained that OMCs were allowed to import low sulphur furnace oil (LSFO) and high-sulphur furnace oil (HSFO) during July-November on the firm demand placed by the power division but the non-upliftment of the committed quantities by the power generation companies or independent power producers (IPPs) ensued a stock build-up at OMC storages. Consequently, the upliftment of furnace oil from refineries was limited and stocks continued to build up.
He said substantial payments were released to IPPs this year and one of the conditions was that power plants would keep mandatory stocks as required by their fuel supply agreements with the OMCs, but all storages of power plants were empty and IPPs were maintaining two to three days of stocks in storages against the mandatory 30 days. 
On the other hand, the refineries were compelled to export furnace oil at great a financial loss. “This export will cripple the already overburdened port infrastructure and industry will face huge demurrages as well,” the DG warned.

4,Simultaneous scrutiny of parties’ funding sought,Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry says ECP can complete in two months the process to ensure use of EVMs in next polls .,"LAHORE: The PTI government has called upon the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to simultaneously scrutinise the funding sources of three major political parties of the country — Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan Peoples Party — and make them public. 
In the second phase, the ECP should do the same for the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), Jamaat-i-Islami and Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI-F). 
The demands were made by federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Fawad Chaudhry and Minister of State for Information Farrukh Habib at a news conference at the Governor House on Sunday. 
“Making ECP-registered political parties’ accounts scrutinised honestly and without any discrimination is mandatory for the commission as advised by the Supreme Court in the Hanif Abbasi case of 2016,” said the state minister. 
The information minister said the incumbent government wanted that the funding sources of all political parties, registered with the ECP, should be open for all. Mr Chaudhry also gave some examples of huge amounts transferred to the PML-N and PPP accounts without disclosure about any sources. 

Minister says ECP can complete in two months the process to ensure use of EVMs in next polls 

He alleged that the PML-N leadership used its party account to whiten their ill-gotten money. “The PTI will continue pursuing this case since it is a complainant against the PML-N and PPP,” he added. 
Mr Chaudhry said the PPP’s funds record for the years 2009-12 was not available and depositing of Rs420 million in a newly opened account in 2013 also lacked information about the funding sources. 
He said that the PPP had got its company registered in the United States for which former ambassador to the US Hussain Haqqani had raised funds. There was no record of millions of dollars collected in the fundraising campaign, he added. 
Farrukh Habib said the PTI had introduced a system of acknowledging its donors and the party had submitted 22 volumes of record of its 40,000 donors to the ECP. He said the commission had constituted a committee in 2017 to scrutinise the accounts of the PML-N and PPP but failed to conclude the exercise so far. 
Mr Habib said the PML-N had nothing to say about its funding sources, adding that former premier Benazir Bhutto had written in her book that Nawaz Sharif had taken money to topple the PPP government. He also said the PML-N had got its party registered in the United Kingdom and the PPP in the United States. 
Fawad Chaudhry said democracy would strengthen when political parties would have their own structures and funding system. He regretted that many extremist parties had got registered with the ECP and they had never given any detail of their funding sources. 
“This is very serious issue and needs to be handled with care,” he said, adding: “There has been an objection that the JUI-F continues getting foreign funding, while there is no information about the funding sources of TLP,” Mr Chaudhry observed. 
The minister, meanwhile, objected to the ‘threats’ hurled by Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and asserted that he should refrain from criticising the federation. “Mr Shah is not ashamed of carrying Faryal Talpur’s purse but always remains ready to hurl threats of breaking Pakistan,” he said. 
Punjab LG law, EVMs
Mr Chaudhry praised Punjab for finalising the Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) 2021 that would devolve powers and resources to grassroots level and create an empowered government. Under the new law, he said, mayors would be elected through direct election in every district of the province and they would nominate their cabinets. 
He said every mayor in a district would literally be a chief minister and all the funds sent to the provinces would ultimately reach the respective districts. “Prime Minister Imran Khan has fulfilled his promise of empowering local governments at grassroots level despite opposition from within the party,” he said. 
Referring to a statement that the upcoming local government elections could not held by using electronic voting machines, the information minister asserted that these could be held by using EVMs by all means. “The ECP should issue a tender and the companies from all over the world would bid and it [commission] could select, purchase and use them in elections,” he said, adding that this process could easily be completed in just two months. 
Stating that the ECP should take this matter a bit seriously, Mr Chaudhry acknowledged that the commission had constituted a committee and was heading towards the use of EVMs. In the upcoming LG elections, he said, all political parties would get a chance to show their muscles. He said PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari had destroyed the party and it would not even be able to get candidates in the next elections. 
Balochistan rally
The information minister said the federal government would give a comprehensive package to southern Balochistan this week and also remove hurdles in the way of resolving the issues being confronted by the people of Gwadar and the province. 
He said the prime minister had taken notice of the rally in Gwadar demanding resolution of their local issues, adding that the people of Balochistan faced problems on the Iranian border following the government’s decision to monitor all borders strictly after the US forces left Afghanistan. “The government is working to resolve Balochistan people’s issues as they feel a sense of deprivation,” he added. 
Fawad Chaudhry said the prime minister would inaugurate the Health Card programme in Punjab on Monday (today), adding that it would help all families save money currently being used for their health concerns. 
The minister said five accused in the Army Public School attack case had already been executed, while one case was being heard by the Supreme Court on a review petition.
