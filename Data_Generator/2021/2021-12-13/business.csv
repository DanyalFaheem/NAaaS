0,Recycling to succeed sustainably,"Tetra Pak has managed to recycle 41 per cent or 26,000 tonnes of its total annual production last year, says MD.","Awais Bin Nasim knows you cannot win all the battles in life and that you should not try to. But the one battle he is determined to win targets the creation of a socially and environmentally sustainable value chain around his company’s main product: liquid food carton packages.
A mechanical engineer with a Lahore University of Management Sciences degree in business management, Mr Nasim has been running Swedish liquid food packaging and processing giant Tetra Pak’s operations in Pakistan as its managing director for around a couple of years. Before his elevation to this position, he had also been the director of the firm’s operations in the Greater Middle East and Africa region.
“In Pakistan, we have managed to recycle 41 per cent or 26,000 tonnes of our total annual production, which stood at nearly five billion cartons last year. Next year we hope to recycle 28,000 tonnes of carton waste. The global recycling average for our company is about 26pc. Pakistan ranks among the top 10 nations out of 190 countries where Tetra Pak is operating,” he says, proud of the sustainability initiative started by Tetra Pak nearly 15 years ago.

In Pakistan, we have managed to recycle 41pc or 26,000 tonnes of our total annual production, which stood at nearly 5bn cartons last year

“We have partnered with two recyclers in Lahore and Karachi for this purpose and developed a demonstrable, scalable and financially sustainable recycling model,” Mr Nasim, who has more than two and a half decades of experience leading operations and business development in companies like Engro, Dadex and Tetra Pak, elaborates.
“We support them in the collection of cartons and marketing the products they make from the carton waste. These are small companies and can’t do without our support.” 
The recyclers have developed technology to separate paper, aluminium and polyethylene from the cartons. Paper is used in making corrugated cartons and aluminium and polyethylene to manufacture roofing tiles and slabs that give you temperature insulation of 10 degrees Celcius. In addition to that, they produce cabins, and lawn and park furniture and swings. These products are now in great demand because of their quality and durability.
Mr Nasim is spot on when he says the success of sustainability initiatives largely depends on the profitable economic activity around them. For example, he says, the billion tree Tsunami initiative needs to be linked with commercial activity to replace import of paperboard and pulp. The government must try to promote the concept of commercial forestry. “Any initiative to increase forestation that does not have an economic activity tied to it will fade out.”
Recycling challenges
The biggest recycling challenge in Pakistan is the absence of waste handling and sustainability initiatives. Thus, the recyclers in Pakistan face enormous difficulties in the collection of carton waste and it starts from the points where these packages are emptied: at homes, restaurants, etc. “There is no concept of segregating different solid waste — glass, paper, plastic, etc — in our country as all is dumped, rolled out and collected as one. With collection starting in one bin, it increases the cost of recycling 2-3 times as it makes waste sorting extremely challenging. 
This also damages the quality of the recyclable waste; our carton packages start to decay, if not sorted out from the dump, in three days following which they cannot be recycled and have to be consigned to landfills,” Mr Nasim explains. 
“Then we don’t have a legal framework around the recycling of waste in our country. This makes the creation of profitable economic activity around waste recycling next to impossible. Tetra Pak is able to achieve a significant amount of its waste recycled because we have created profitable economic activity around this in the last 10 years or so. Legal framework and infrastructure are crucial to the generation of viable business models and economic activities around sustainability initiatives. The government should provide a law. When the government says you can’t dispose of all solid waste in one bin consumers will start  segregating the waste. Until then why would anyone invest additional money in waste disposal?”
Now the recyclers are approaching housing societies and asking them to segregate solid waste and forward for recycling. 
“Nobody has asked us to take this sustainability initiative as there is no law in Pakistan. We are doing it because of our social responsibility.”
Mr Nasim says his company is working closely with other industrial stakeholders as well as the government to build legislation and regulations, and create public awareness around its sustainability initiative. 
“Everybody is trying to do something. Now we have formed an industry alliance, which is also working closely with the government to address issues related to waste recycling. But the problem on the ground relates to building infrastructure for collection and recycling. There is a unanimous agreement by the industry that we all need to come together to address the recycling needs; how it will happen is the challenge. That’s why we need legislation around it because, in its absence, it is very difficult for people to follow it — or for the industry to make it happen. 
“If someone thinks the change can be brought about overnight, they are grossly mistaken. We need laws, regulations and initiatives that can assist in the creation of economic activity around the sustainability initiatives, and help us move forward in phases,” the managing director underscores.
Mr Nasim rightly says no one can do this alone. “We are doing our part but that is not enough. What we are saying is that let’s solve the problem starting from waste collection, waste sorting, and not dumping the collected waste in landfills that are creating an environmental challenge and are not generating any economic activity. 
“Neither government nor the private sector can pull it off on their own. It has to be a collective, collaborative effort that takes the whole view of solid waste and not just food cartons or plastic. But the government’s role is crucial in providing infrastructure and environment where the shift towards social and environmental sustainability can be made gradually. But the push has to come through legislation and regulations on the disposal of waste.”

"
1,From poor to the rich,The tax proposals show that the FBR could have been carried away by the demands of rent-seeking business.,"The ‘mini-budget’ coming up soon before the parliament envisaging around Rs550 billion in fiscal adjustments would carry two critical highlights among other things — taxing the poor and facilitating the rich. This is in the shape of withdrawal of tax exemptions on items of common use and substantial further relaxations to the real estate.
In the broader narrative, the Chairman Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) crafts the Finance (Supplementary) Bill, 2021 as an amendment in tax laws that “are warranted in order to achieve efficiency and equity in the tax system through removal of aberrations, broaden the tax base, and document the economy”.
As they say, however, the devil is in the details. The proposals in effect promote further inequity in the country’s taxation system as the summary of tax proposals seeks to make it difficult for the people to have access to medicines and extends further tax breaks and concessions to certain vested interests.
An analysis of just two tax proposals contained in the summary is a case in point to uncover the direction of these proposals. For example, amendment in the Sales Tax Act, 1990, demands that “exemption regime under the Sixth Schedule is proposed to be curtailed including pharmaceutical sector and restricted to import and local supply of essential commodities only”.
It has been proposed to the government that the Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, enlisting items exempt from sales tax on import may be curtailed to only essential commodities and that the pharmaceutical industry may be excluded from the Sixth Schedule and therefore exempt from sales tax.

The tax proposals show that the FBR could have been carried away by the demands of rent-seeking business groups as often bemoaned by PM’s adviser on finance Shaukat Tarin

The FBR does not seem to have considered the implications of this proposal viewed in the context of already too expensive medicines, rising manifold over the last three years. The FBR apparently wants to maintain sales tax exemption on essential commodities needed in good health but withdraw such exemption on essential items needed by patients.
The prices of medicines have already risen beyond the reach of middle and lower-income segments of society. Many people have learned to live with diseases because they cannot afford the cost of treatment. The FBR’s proposal to take the pharmaceutical industry out of the Sixth Schedule carries implications for the health of the multitude.
Another amendment from the FBR through supplementary finance bill seeks that “Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under the Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) regulations, 2015, is proposed to be extended”. The tax proposals in the summary show that the FBR could have been carried away by the demands of certain business groups that keep on lobbying for rent-seeking as often bemoaned by the prime minister’s adviser on finance Shaukat Tarin.
This is based on a joint demand from seven REIT sponsors — AKD Reit Management, Arif Habib Dolmen Reit Management, ISE Reit Management, Magnus Investment Advisors, SB Global Reit, TPL Reit and Veritas REIT.
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) apparently have supported this as it amended the Real Estate Investment Trust Regulations, 2015, allowing such trusts to create SPVs. The management of the seven such REITs has not been content with the tax benefits already extended by law to the REITs under their management and control.
Therefore, they jointly wrote to the FBR asking for tax benefits for their SPVs similar to those already being enjoyed by their REITs. Without going into the merits of the move, some precautions are genuinely required when dealing with private SPVs that would involve citizens’ money.
The SPVs are business entities that have been used in the past to commit the greatest accounting frauds in American corporate history. The theoretical justification for any parent company to create an SPV is to get a credit rating better than its own and thus to cut down the cost of its capital. However, an SPV also affords the parent company a novel opportunity to commit accounting fraud or to defraud its investors.
Enron, the well-known energy giant in corporate America capitalised on this opportunity, used its SPVs to conceal huge debt from its investors and finally became bankrupt bringing financial demise to its millions of investors.
While seeking exemption of corporate income tax, the REITs proposed that any income derived by a collective investment scheme, a REIT Scheme including the income of an SPV structured under 2015 REIT Regulations, if not less than 90 per cent of its accounting income of that year as reduced by capital gains whether realised or unrealised is distributed among the unit or certificate holders or shareholders as the case may be.
Secondly, it has also been proposed that dividends received by REITs from SPV should not be taxed. Similarly, capital gains accruing to a seller of shares of SPV to a REIT scheme should not be taxed until June 30, 2023.
Interestingly tax benefits for an SPV are something which even Enron did not seem to have demanded from its regulators in America where SPVs had been repeatedly used to plunder the investors. In Pakistan too, the FBR and SECP would hopefully put in place safety nets that ensure that SPVs allowed by the Securities & Exchange Commission and to be nurtured through tax exemptions by FBR will not follow that route.
On the positive side, the supplementary bill also seeks, on the demands of international lending agencies and Organisation for Eco­nomic Cooperation and Development to fight corruption across borders, to have mandatory “disclosure of information in respect of high-level public officials” regarding assets and investments in line with the requirements of the development partners, rule of law and integrity.

2,Trade deficit — the worst is almost over,"Global Container Freight Rate Index soared from $3,143 in Dec 2020 to $10,839 in Sept 2021 before falling.","There’s bad news. The trade deficit has gotten out of hand. But there’s good news too. The deficit has peaked and it is expected to shrink in the second half of the fiscal year, between January and June 2022. 
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics says imports in July-Nov 2021 surged 69 per cent year-on-year to $32.934 billion. But export earnings totalled $12.344bn, despite about 27pc yearly growth. This produced a huge trade deficit of $20.59bn, about 112pc higher than the July-Nov 2020 deficit of $9.724bn.
This meteoric rise in the deficit is the primary reason for the rupee depreciation. In five months, the rupee lost over 11.5pc value against the greenback. It plunged to 175.72 a dollar at the end of Nov from 157.54 at the end of June. Now, the placement of the $3bn Saudi foreign currency deposit with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has minimised the worries of the central bank regarding the adequacy of its forex reserves. This means speculative dollar buying may remain under check at least for a few months taking extra pressure off the foreign exchange rate.

Global Container Freight Rate Index soared from $3,143 in December 2020 to $10,839 in September 2021 before falling — this should help check the growth in the import bill in the second half of our fiscal year 

But is there any hope for improvement in the fundamentals of the external sector, particularly in foreign trade? 
The answer is YES. The merchandise trade deficit has almost peaked. We may see a declining trend in the deficit from January 2020, if not from Dec 2021. This is not mere optimism. A careful review of the foreign trade situation points towards this possibility. 
One big reason for the increase in the import bill has been a steep rise in global freight rates. Global Container Freight Rate Index that tracks these rates soared from $3,143 in December 2020 to $10,839 in September 2021. The index then started falling. At the end of November, it was $9,353. This declining trend is expected onwards if no eventuality hits the world. This should help check the growth in the import bill in the second half of our fiscal year ie Jan-June 2021. (Most containerised import cargoes are booked a few months before at the prevailing freight rates and the benefit of lower rates comes with a time lag).
Crude oil prices are showing some respite in the rising trend that we saw till the end of November and the trend may continue as the global economy is not growing at the initially estimated pace. Arab Light Crude, for example, fell from about $85 a barrel on November 10 to a little over $75 on December 7. This oil pricing trend, along with the efforts being made to strike the right balance between imports of crude oil and finished oil products, should also help in containing the imports bill in the second half of the fiscal year. 
The International Monetary Fund’s estimate for 2021 global economic growth is 5.9pc and 4.9pc for 2021. A full one percentage deceleration in the global growth rate for the next year may lead to some reduction in international fuel oil prices next year. And, that may translate into a lower average oil import price for Pakistan as well. Although the government hopes to hit Pakistan’s economic growth target of 5pc during this fiscal year, a slowdown in the targeted pace of growth would also lead to a lower import bill. 
Even if Pakistan is spared from the spread of the latest variant of Covid-19 (Omicron) and thus avoids lockdowns and lowered business activities, ongoing energy woes have already started affecting large-scale industrial output. Besides, the initial pick up in aggregate demand is losing steam. 
Together these two factors can reduce the goods’ import bill in the second half of this fiscal year. (The output of large-scale manufacturing grew just 5.15pc in July-Sep this year from a year ago. And, the monthly quantum index of manufacturing continued to slide downwards in seven out of eight months since February 2021 when it had peaked past 175. In September, the index reading was close to 140).
On the other hand, consumer demand for goods has also seen its best during the first half of FY22 (July-Dec 2021) and it cannot be expected to grow any faster in the second half. Fears of Omicron are real, political uncertainty is growing and growth-induced job creation remains limited. All three factors put together are expected to lead to slower consumer spending. And, on top of all this interest rate tightening and the SBP’s advice to banks to pay a certain rate of return on savings may also depress demand in the coming two quarters. 
Even if the central bank, that hiked its key policy rate by 150 basis points on November 19, keeps the rate stable in its next policy review due on December 14, it may come up with some mechanism for keeping the interbank market less liquid, (for example, an increase in banks mandatory cash reserves or statutory liquid reserves) and some measures to contain rapid growth in imports (like revised regulations for imports). That, too, would lead to a slower rise in the import bill in the second half of this fiscal year. And, that deceleration can become more pronounced if the government also decides to bring more tariff lines under stricter regulations and higher import duties.
So, a slowdown in merchandise imports bill growth in the second half seems almost a certainty. What is yet to be seen is how much relief it would bring in terms of volumes of foreign exchange and at what cost to the economy and to the manufacturing sector that relies heavily on imported inputs.

3,The cost of outdated farm machinery,Harvesters alone wreck 10-20pc losses at the final stage that can translate to losses as high as $1.52bn in imports,"Led by its energetic agriculture minister Hussain Jehania Gardezi, Punjab this year has put in an extraordinary effort to meet the wheat sowing target and that too on time. It has largely been successful on both accounts: it has almost achieved its assigned target of 16.20 million acres and did so by the start of December — at least two weeks before the traditional timeline.  
Punjab set itself a difficult task when it accepted the 21.9m tonnes target against actual production of 20.9m tonnes last year — critics thought it was much less than that. For achieving it, it revised its acreage target upwards to 16.7m acres against the federal target of 16.2m acres. For the first time, it inducted over 20,000 agriculture students to convince farmers in favour of sowing wheat and do so early. It offered a subsidy (Rs1,200 per bag) on one million bags of certified seed, on weedicides for 3m acres and rusticide for another million acres.
With this heroic effort completed, the wheat planners, the minister including, are now worried if their exertions would be translated into actual yield or the current dilapidated state of farm machinery will send it down the drain. 

Harvesters alone wreck 10-20pc losses at the final stage that can translate to losses as high as $1.52bn in imports 

Dusting off old studies and conducting new research, they now say that the harvesters alone wreck 10 to 20 per cent losses at the final stage. In quantum, it means about 2m tonnes of wheat every year. In monetary terms, it means Rs100 billion to Rs200bn losses to farmers, two to four million tonnes of wheat loss to national food basket, import of corresponding quantity costing $760m to $1.52bn (at the current rate of $380 per ton) in foreign exchange and food insecurity to hundreds of thousands of people. The sheer force of these numbers has overwhelmed planners, who now want the government to come up with a plan to control these “controllable losses.” 
“Most of them, if not all, were imported as secondhand machines, or downright scrap, and assembled here with the help of local mechanics and are imperfect,” accepts Mr Gardezi. They certainly need to be refurbished or replaced, if we want to save those losses. “A plan for them is surely required, and required right away,” Mr Gardezi pleads.    
“According to the Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited (PRAL) data, the country has 25,000 to 30,000 combine harvesters, which were imported during the last two decades, working in the country” explains Dr Iqrar A. Khan, vice-chancellor of the Agriculture University (Faisalabad), who inducted students and led the wheat-sowing campaign. These harvesters are too old to work efficiently and are causing losses. Seasonal wear and tear, rough environment and lack of maintenance have rendered them counter-productive for the crop. Farmers over time have become overwhelmingly dependent on them.  
“Over 90pc of the area is now harvested through these machines,” says Abad Khan, a farmer from central Punjab. The actual operations of these machines reveal the damages they wreak on the yield. They are rarely sent to qualified mechanics during the season because of loss of the daily income and the high cost of repair. Thus routine faults are attended by drivers in the fields, costing efficiency. 
Parts for replacements also come from old machines or are copied by the local grinders, says Mr Khan adding: “to make matters worse, the major brunt of poor operations is borne by smaller farmers. The bigger ones have the luxury of choosing machines and service providers.
“We need to look at the crop from start to end — from sowing to harvesting — not at one stage, like Punjab seems to be doing right now; riveting all attention on the sowing side.” 
It can be done easily. “The government can pre-qualify a few well-reputed global firms. Allow them to open showrooms here, bring their spare parts and offer after-sale services. Ask importers to import from them only. Then offer soft loans to farmers or service providers” suggests a senior official of the Punjab government. These proposals have been on the table for decades now. 
However, with Pakistan becoming a net importer of wheat and the national food security picture worsening, these losses assume added significance and so efforts are being made to control them. 
“Or alternately, press the local tractor manufacturers into making these farm machines as well,” suggests Mr Khan. These machines are not too sophisticated. And then why only combine harvesters, why not all kinds of machines required in the field. The real challenge is to develop a service providing industry. This can be done by offering subsidised  loans to manufacturers and duty breaks, he recommends.

4,Can the arhti be eliminated?,The field is left open to him and he exploits it to the fullest.,"In the recent episode of hyperinflation and the galloping commodity prices, a market player that has constantly been attacked for profiteering and manipulation is the arhti. It is, of course, a repeat of the chorus from all such episodes in the past. Once prices stabilise somewhat, business as usual will return. 
Also forgotten will be the fact that that the farmers are the most excluded lot when it comes to formal credit. The total stock of private sector credit at the end of 2020-21 was Rs7.63 trillion. Out of this, a mere Rs 292.3 billion was the share of agriculture. 
In the first month of the current fiscal year, the flow of credit to agriculture declined by Rs8.8bn or almost seven times the decline in the corresponding month of last year. This is despite the fact that banks are given targets by the State Bank and noncompliance invites penalties.
Paying penalties is, however, deemed by the banks as less costly than the hassles of compliance in an area that gives them little comfort. Commercial banks are used to lending to a profligate government to live happily ever after.

The National Rural Support Programme’s Sugarcane Production Enhancement Project aims to link the small farmer, microfinance institutions and the processor in a high-impact value chain

This is where the arhti comes in. The field is left open to him and he exploits it to the fullest. He performs a useful function. For the farmer, it’s a Hobson’s choice. The arhti is there when he needs cash for inputs. He facilitates the movement of output from the farm to the commodity market at prices that favour him rather than the farmer. In times of crop failures and personal needs such as births, deaths and marriages, he is like the next-door neighbour. He charges a lot more than is his due when the going is good. The interest can be as high as 70-80 per cent, and roll-overs are easily granted. 
Lending is in money, but the servicing is usually in kind. Both sides avoid using the word interest. In short, arhti caters to the needs of production, development and consumption. The last-mentioned is a no-go for bank lending.
An International Growth Centre (IGC) study in 2013 prescribed the creation of an intermediary that functions like the arhti, but without its exploitative and speculative characteristics. “To create a win-win, where farmers and banks both benefit, a model involving an ‘intermediary’ that incorporates the arhti’s strategies needs to be tested. 
The ‘intermediary’ would connect the bank to the clients and play the role that the arthi plays, with value-added services (such as access to latest farming techniques, modern farm equipment and inputs that can help increase yield and productivity). 
The intermediary, like the arthi, would help manage the bank’s risk by a) identifying the right client b) correctly assessing his credit needs c) ensuring that loan proceeds are used for the intended purpose d) controlling the farmer’s cash flows by managing his crop’s sale proceeds. 
The intermediary’s value-added service relating to farm efficiency and productivity would further reduce the credit risk. Insurance against catastrophic risks (such as floods or pest attacks) would need to be built into the model as these tend to be the only systemic threat.
Could the intermediary be the microfinance banks? These have been in the field for quite some time, but their footprint in the rural economy remains limited. To a certain extent, they act like commercial banks and, to that extent, are disabled to adapt to the arhti’s function. In the first quarter of the current fiscal year, they disbursed 15.4pc of their annual target, even less than 19.3pc by commercial banks.
The inspiration for the IGC study came from a project undertaken by the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP) in 2001, called the Sugarcane Production Enhancement Project (SPEP). It aimed to link the small farmer, microfinance institutions and the processor in a high-impact value chain with high financial and social returns. 
Some 1,800 small farmers were organised and extended loans ranging from Rs7,000-10,000 per acre to buy inputs. To improve yield per acre, an institutional mechanism was created to provide modern advisory services. 
The soil was tested to set up a benchmark and the farmer was obliged to follow the guidance of the advisory services. An agreement was signed between the sugar mill and NRSP to buy all output with prompt cash payment.
This experiment’s success can be judged by the fact that the registered farmers had doubled by the end of the third year. The project was able to reach 3,666 smallholder farmers. Per acre yield increased and the contribution of small farmers to the overall sugarcane supply of the mill reached 11.5pc. 
The small farmer benefitted from high incomes because of improved yields and the sugar mill from getting high-quality yields which lead them to plan for expansion of their factory.
Most importantly, this collaboration benefited small farmers because investments were made in developing infrastructure irrigation, and technical guidance regarding seed and farm equipment. The social impact has been assessed by a third party evaluation and found to be highest amongst all NRSP microfinance investments. The SPEP project is now operational in 44 union councils of Rahim Yar khan with registered smallholder farmers. 
Today, 15pc of sugar mill supply (after extending the production capacity of sugar mills) is provided by communities organised by NRSP. They are now able to obtain a yield of around 32 tonnes of sugarcane per acre. The experiment demonstrated that the generational bondage between the small farmer and the shop arhti can be broken.

5,Pakistan’s progress on SDGs,Report acknowledges a data lag.,"The Sustainable Development Report 2021 has been released and hotly debated among policy circles. Here I take a deeper look at the report with a reference to Pakistan. 
An annual publication, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Index claims to track a country’s performance on the 17 SDGs. The report combines data and analyses produced by the United Nations, the World Bank and others as well as from non-official sources (research institutions and non-governmental organisations). 
It is not an official SDG monitoring tool but instead complements efforts of national statistical offices and international organisations to collect data on and standardise SDG indicators. Due to time lags in data generation, reporting and addition of new indicators, this year’s SDG Index and dashboards do not fully reflect the impact of Covid19. 
Owing to changes in the indicator selection, the 2021 rankings and scores are not comparable with last year’s results. The report points to consider countries’ performances at the goal and indicator level. 
The report highlights that the pandemic has been a huge setback for sustainable development. For the first time since the adoption of the SDGs in 2015, the global average SDG Index score for 2020 has decreased from the previous year: a decline driven to a large extent by increased poverty rates and unemployment following the outbreak.
Pakistan’s position — 2020 vs 2021
The score signifies a country’s position between the worst (0) and the best or target (100) outcomes. 
Pakistan with an overall Index score in 2021 of 57.7 means that the country is on average 57.7 per cent on the way to the best possible outcome across the 17 SDGs. This score is 1.5pc higher than the country’s score in 2020. Pakistan is categorised in the East and South Asia region that comprises 21 countries including China and Singapore, pushing the regional scores upward. Compared to 2020, Pakistan’s performance has increased by 3pc in the region. 
Despite the Covid-19 global pushback, Pakistan’s SDG Global Rank is 129 (out of 193) in 2021, improved by five ranks, 134 (out of 166) in 2020. Compared to its neighbours, Bangladesh’s rank stayed at 109 during 2020 and 2021. India’s rank declined by three, from 117 to 120 between 2020 to 2021. 

The report acknowledges a data lag — for example, the proportion of the population with access to electricity is reported to be at 71.1pc, however, according to updated national data sources access to electricity stands at 96pc 

Despite the overall improvement in the score, in terms of trends for Goals’ achievement, Pakistan’s performance is only on track against Goal 13 (Climate Action). All other goals’ progress is either moderately improving or stagnating and worsening in the case of Goal 15 (Life on Land).
The report does not refer to national and updated data sets at some places, thus affecting the ranking and scoring of the country. The report acknowledges that data lags in reporting. This means some of the progress in certain areas that countries including Pakistan made remains unaccounted for in the report. For example, against SDGs indicator 7.1.1, the proportion of the population with access to electricity is reported to be declining and at 71.1pc (2018). According to updated national data sources (Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement), access to electricity has increased by 3pc between 2015 to 2020 and stands at 96pc in 2020 including 5pc off-grid. 
Similarly, population with access to clean fuels and technology for cooking, SDGs indicator 7.1.2, has been reported 43.3pc (2016). According to the latest national data sources (PSLM), the population with access to clean fuels and technology for cooking increased by 5.7pc between 2015 to 2019 and stands at 47pc in 2019-20.
The government has taken a number of steps to help keep the achievement of SDGs on track. To measure the effects of Covid-19 and to produce an evidence-based plan, the government initiated a dedicated survey. 
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics Covid-19 specific survey (2020), 27.31 million working population was affected. Related to SDG 1 (No Poverty) and SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth, 20.6m people could not work during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. Whereas 6.7m people said that their income was declined. As a coping mechanism, half of the households reduced their non-food expenditures and 74pc of the informal workers were affected. 
The government came up with an Rs1.24 trillion stimulus package to boost the overall economic situation and especially, in a bid to reduce the impact of Covid-19 on poverty (SDG 1), hunger (SDG 2), health (SDG 3) and SDG 8 on Decent Work and Economic Growth. 
Related to SDG 3 on Good Health and Well-being, even before Covid-19, Pakistan had a fragile healthcare system with insufficient facilities to meet the needs of the population. There is on average one hospital bed available for over 1,680 people. 
Related to SDG 4 on Quality Education, the Covid-19 pandemic directly impacted 42m children from pre-primary and primary to higher secondary and degree college levels. Mobility constraints, non-availability of internet, non-access to tele-schooling facilities had a disproportionate adverse impact on the most vulnerable groups, particularly females and other marginalised groups and those in rural areas and urban slums.
The government is continuing with the better containment of pandemic along with the roll-out of vaccination and continuation of Ehsaas Programme, linked to SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3 and SDG 4. As of December 1, 2021, 33pc (5.07m) of Pakistan’s eligible population has been fully vaccinated with a total of 124.05m vaccines administered. Taking timely action in view of the new coronavirus variant Omicron, the government, NCOC, also approved a booster shot of Covid-19 vaccines for healthcare workers, immunocompromised people and those aged over 50 years on December 1, 2021.
One of the key areas of government’s attention is education. Concerning education achievements, the country’s progress has been dismal. The primary completion rate has stagnated at 67pc in five years between 2015-20. Similarly, the gender gap of 9pc between the primary completion rate of males and females has also persisted in this period. 
The government, like other developing countries, faces huge fiscal challenges to meet SDGs. This has been also been acknowledged in the Sustainability Report 2021. According to an International Monetary Fund study (2021) on the costing of SDGs relating to education, health and physical capital (electricity, roads, and water and sanitation), additional annual spending of about 16pc of GDP will be required until 2030 from the public and private sectors combined to help these SDGs.

6,Steering growth with rising risks,The share of economic activities in overall tax revenues is less than the windfall from inflation.,"Owing to double-digit inflation, currency depreciation, interest rate hikes and higher import bill, the prime minister’s finance advisor Shaukat Tarin says there are uncertainties in the market.
The record imports in November dragged the rupee to a historical low, share prices crashed and forex reserves fell to $16 billion on December 2 from $20.146bn on August 27.
The economy is in slumpflation where output is slowly growing along with accelerated inflation, says Dr Fahd Rehman, assistant professor of economics at Lahore University of Management Sciences.
Despite the current recovery, the overall domestic production is still below the pre-pandemic level.
However, the profits of the corporate sector are growing on the back of stimuli as well as inflation especially of those firms which can manage to sell their goods at higher prices.
And Prime Minister Imran Khan says growth this year would be 1 per cent higher than that in 2020-21.
“There is no need to worry, look at the fundamentals of the economy,” says Mr Tarin, adding that “the only permanent is that the economy is growing.” He assured the people and the market that the difficulties would subside in a few months. 

The share of economic activities in overall tax revenues is less than the windfall from inflation

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has however recently started to hike its policy rate with more frequent planned periodical reviews of its monetary policy.   
The SBP has already taken some steps and the government is planning to take regulatory measures to curb ‘non-essential’ imports while trying to protect the growth trend.
The short-term regulatory measures taken in the first two years of the PTI government and the State Bank’s tight monetary policy did reduce trade and current account deficits by suppressing domestic demand and economic growth.
But this did not bring structural changes in the deep-seated foreign trade pattern in an import-oriented, debt-driven and heavily subsidised economy. During July-November, spending on imports soared to $33bn as against the much slower-moving export earnings of $12.4bn.
An International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) empirical study in 2011 suggested that fragmented countries with a high degree of political instability need to address root causes. Only then they could have durable economic policies that can engender high economic growth.
That is perhaps the reason why the IMF is insisting that the PTI government should get the proposed State Bank autonomy bill passed by the parliament instead of issuing a presidential ordinance. 
Mr Tarin says inflation and import bill were interconnected as domestic produce and perishable items had an inflationary rate of only 3-4pc. He was referring to the inflation rate of 11.53pc and the surge in the import bill to $7.75bn in November.
As the economy is growing, he says, taxes are not only growing because of imports but across the board. There is 32pc growth in income tax and a 16pc increase in the overall tax collection during the first five months of this fiscal year.
However, the Federal Board of Revenue figures show nearly 54pc of the total tax revenue was raised at the import stage. Sales tax contributed 80pc while it was negative at the domestic stage. And the share of economic activities in overall tax revenues was less than the windfall from inflation.
Under the IMF deal, the government is required to impose Rs525bn worth of taxes on consumers, increase electricity charges and withdraw untargeted subsidies. Analysts say this would lead to another round of inflation.
Despite the rise in international commodity prices, more quantity of goods exported fetched fewer dollars because the value of the national currency has fallen below its real effective exchange rate. The growing adverse terms of foreign trade are further widening the trade deficit.
The government is however confident that rising exports and workers remittances would finance the trade deficit that it expects to come down to a manageable level as international prices of commodities, now beginning to fall, stabilise.
Here it may be noted that foreign debt repayments and debt servicing have increased to $13.4bn this year from $7.5bn in June 2018. Out of $31bn borrowed by the incumbent government, the bulk was used to pay interests on past loans but more than $5bn were procured to finance current expenditure. 
In an article titled Economic aid: a curse?, independent researcher Ayaz Ahmed wrote that stagflation can’t be addressed by IMF’s loans and the Fund’s induced reforms.
A meeting convened by Mr Tarin to discuss the balance of payments position noted that the global prices of crude oil and coal had started falling which will reduce the import bill and import-related inflation. And there will be fewer imports of food items, furnace oil and vaccines. That may lead to a drop in inflation and strengthen the rupee.
But global commodity prices are unlikely to stabilise before June 2022, according to creditable research reports. In the United States, over half of the small businesses — the highest on record — plan to increase their prices over the next three months, according to a National Federation of Independent Business survey.
In America, there are two conflicting approaches to tackling inflation. Noting that inflation has hit its highest level since the 1990s, Noble prize winner Paul Krugman still argues that the call to the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to cool the economy, ‘seems premature at best.’
In his opinion, “the overall demand hasn’t actually grown all that fast.” GDP is still below its pre-pandemic trend even though labour markets seem very tight, with high quit rates and rising wages.
(Under its dual mandate the US Fed is also obligated to maximise sustainable employment.)
There is growing evidence that supply chains are getting unkinked, which, Mr Krugman says, should provide some relief to the consumers. Inflation should come down as the economy adjusts. Matters would be different if we saw signs of a 1970s wage-price spiral. But so far we don’t.
The contrary view is: with the inflation rising to alarming levels, the Federal Reserve Bank should move to cool the economy, says Michel R. Strain, director, economic policy studies, at the American Enterprise Institute.
“If the Fed doesn’t, it risks inviting a sluggish economy — or even a recession — in the coming years.”

7,Data points,Historic burst of entrepreneurship,"Historic burst of entrepreneurship
The pandemic has unleashed a historic burst in entrepreneurship and self-employment. Hundreds of thousands of Americans are striking out on their own as consultants, retailers and small-business owners. The move helps explain the ongoing shake-up in the world of work, with more people looking for flexibility, anxious about Covid exposure, upset about vaccine mandates or simply disenchanted with pre-pandemic office life. It is also aggravating labour shortages in some industries and adding pressure on companies to revamp their employment policies. The number of unincorporated self-employed workers has risen by 500,000 since the start of the pandemic, Labor Department data show, to 9.44m. That is the highest total since the financial-crisis year 2008, except for this summer. The total amounts to an increase of 6pc in the self-employed, while the overall US employment total remains nearly 3pc lower than before the pandemic.

Fear is not fact
Our brains interpret uncertainty as danger, which is why — in our minds — a typo at work turns into us being fired. Thanks to our ancient ancestors, our brains are designed to expect the worst. When early humans were wandering the Earth, underestimating what was around the corner could be deadly. This is why the most primitive parts of our brains take a “better safe than sorry” approach to uncertainties, both big and small. This is called catastrophising and is especially common among young adults because the most uncertain and unsettled years of our lives happen between the ages of 18 and 35. It’s the time when we are picking our graduating from school, getting our first jobs or living alone for the first time. Research shows that, in our 20s, the prefrontal cortex — or the part of our brains that problem solves during uncertain moments — is still developing. That doesn’t mean young adults can’t cope. Rather, it means that now is a great time to hardwire new habits, such as slowing down and thinking things through.

Money does buy happiness
That money can’t buy happiness is an age-old trope. Since the advent of modern public-opinion research, scholars have been trying to test it — with varying results. Researchers have found while Americans’ assessment of life satisfaction went up in lockstep with income, their emotional well-being plateaued after a household income of about $90,000 a year. Harvard psychology doctoral student and former software product manager Matthew Killingsworth developed a measurement tool, an iPhone app called Track Your Happiness that pings users at random intervals and asks about their activities and feelings, often using a sliding scale for answers. One early finding, published in 2010, was that wandering minds bring unhappiness. Mr Killingsworth, now a senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, has since used his app to measure the link between happiness and income. The conclusion is that while the connection is stronger for life satisfaction than it is for experienced well-being, it doesn’t disappear for the latter after $90,000. Money keeps buying happiness, even for the affluent.

Missing votes of youth
Youth voter turnout in the past eight elections happens to be just 31pc, which is 13 percentage points lower than the average overall voter turnout in these eight elections. Youth voter turnout is even lower than women voter turnout during the past two elections. The estimated average youth voter turnout is a mere 31pc compared to 40pc for women voter turnout and 53pc for average national voter turnout during the last two elections in 2013 and 2018. In India, youth participation in the 2019 general election exceeded the all India turnout by approximately 2pc. Generally, voter turnout in Pakistan is on an upward trajectory for the past 3 decades after hitting the lowest point in 1997. The age group of 30 -49-year-old voters has always had the highest turnout whereas youth voter turnout is very low, much lower than usual voter turnout.

13,A summit too high to scale?,"Govt may well have its reasons to stay away from US-led Summit, but decision has sent jitters down spine of business community.","WHAT purpose, if at all, the recent Democracy Summit hosted by US President Joe Biden served is not clear, but the business community seems to be worried by the government’s decision to stay away from it. Turning down the US invite, they think, was not a smart move for a country already seeking favours from Western institutions. The decision may entail economic consequences, they fear. 
Those with particular concerns are the exporters and ones seeking partnerships with Western companies. “As if adjusting to rising input cost, utility rate hike, gas shortages, expensive bank loans, reversal of subsidies, exemptions and amnesty schemes was easy. A more hostile world will be too much to deal with,” said a businessman on return from an investors’ conference in Dubai last week. 
He was disturbed because a potential investor he was courting for a business partnership told him over the dinner table: “Individually, you are great to associate with, but Pakistan is the last place I would consider investing in irrespective of returns. Nothing is worth risking life for me.”  
A trade expert sharing views anonymously said: “On the heels of the ghastly Sialkot incident, the government’s stance on Biden’s Summit could be misconstrued and used by the hostile lobbies to hurt Pakistan’s interests. Unless China had given an ultimatum to pick a side, there was no justification for missing an opportunity to represent Pakistan at a global forum”.

The govt may well have its reasons to stay away from the US-led Democracy Summit, but the decision has sent jitters down the spine of the business community

Commenting on the issue adviser on finance and revenue Shaukat Tarin owned up the government’s position. He wrote in a brief response to Dawn: “We cannot compromise on our principles no matter what the consequences”. 
M. Abdul Aleem, General Secretary of the Overseas Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was not convinced. “From a trade and investment perspective, Pakistan should have participated in the virtual summit, maybe through a member of the PTI team, if the prime minister was reluctant. Granted the US has underplayed Pakistan’s contribution towards regional peace, but we must keep in perspective US’s influence in the international finance institutions and the Financial Action Task Force. Moreover, the US is our largest trading partner. Considering the negative fallout of the Sialkot incident, we should have been rational and not emotional”.  
Reluctant to own his comments, a former president of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) said diplomacy was all about engaging; to hear and to be heard. “The government could have conveyed its reservations over excluding China, Russia, Sri Lanka etc, while at the same time adding a voice to the global call to resist and reject the resurgence of intolerant authoritarian streaks around the world,” he commented.
FPCCI President Mian Nasser Hayat Maggo sounded anxious. “No, I am not satisfied with Pakistan’s economic diplomacy. I don’t believe we can grow and prosper in isolation. The government should not have missed a global platform to address world’s concerns,” he said over the phone. 
On its part, the government seems content with the quality of economic diplomacy. It has claimed a close cordial relationship with all nations. According to a source in the relevant ministry, Pakistan has bilateral investment agreements with Australia, Azerbaijan, Mauritius, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Morocco, Belarus, Netherlands, Belgo-Luxemburg Economic Union, Oman, the Philippines, Bosnia, Portugal, Bulgaria, Qatar, Cambodia, Romania, China, Singapore, the Czech Republic, South Korea, Denmark, Spain, Egypt, Sri Lanka, France, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Indonesia, Syria, Iran, Tajikistan, Italy, Tunisia, Japan, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kuwait, the UAE, the Kyrgyz Republic, the United Kingdom, Lebanon, Uzbekistan, Laos and Yemen. The country has free trade agreements with Sri Lanka, China, and Malaysia. Pakistan is a member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and signed preferential trade agreements with Iran, Indonesia, and Mauritius.
Pakistan has still not been able to boost exports or attract foreign direct investment anywhere close to its potential. Bangladesh annual exports are racing to cross $40 billion while Pakistan’s has been vacillating in a narrow band of $25-28bn for the past many years.  According to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to India have grown by a whopping 45 per cent from $44.5bn in 2016 to $64bn in 2020. Pakistan on the other hand found FDI to contract by almost a fifth from $2.5bn to $2.1bn in the same period.
Khalid Mansoor, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), was reached for his input on the issue. In a written response, he said: “Since I do not have the full background of the decision taken by the government with regards to the Democracy Summit, I can’t comment. As far as China relations are concerned, the CPEC Authority has been receiving full cooperation and support from the Chinese side regardless of any developments on the international front.”
A private trend-watcher tried to paint the larger picture thus: “The government can scream itself hoarse boasting friendly ties with China, but the fact that Beijing is dragging its feet over CPEC is obvious. Saudi Arabia that bailed Pakistan out in the past has also changed colours. It did agree to lend $4.2bn, including a $3bn cash deposit at 4pc interest for a year that can be withdrawn on a three-day notice and $1.2bn for deferred oil payment facility at 3.8pc interest that has to be returned in full next year. The International Monetary Fund has yet to resume funding under its programme though the government has complied with many of its conditions. Sorry, but how delusional can one be?” 
“The elite in Pakistan may not champion democracy, but resent souring relations with the West. The government must do all in its power to re-energise CPEC, but must keep the orientation of society and economy in mind when dealing with global partners,” advised a former diplomat.
The ministries of foreign affairs and commerce were approached, but their response did not reach Dawn till the filing of this report.

14,Will the Sialkot incident affect GSP Plus?,"These incidents are adding up — the European Union would like to exercise some pressure, especially regarding blasphemy law.","Ladies stripped and paraded, hundreds of rapes taped, a person burnt to death, but the business mill continues.
While random unverified tweets claim that Pakistan’s exports orders are suffering in the aftermath of the horrific Sialkot incident, all stakeholders contacted were unified in vociferously discrediting such a notion.
“It is an isolated incident,” said Khurrum Mukhtar, Patron in Chief of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association. “The community responded in a positive manner and the government swiftly took action so I do not think that GSP Plus will be affected either.”
Other stakeholders admitted that while there was some reputational damage, there was no negative news from Lahore or Faisalabad, the bigger markets, of a drop in orders or a change in business as usual.

These incidents are adding up — the European Union would like to exercise some pressure, especially with regards to the blasphemy law

“Overall it was a disaster,” said a stakeholder who requested to not be named, “we can only do damage control now. But the country’s overall response, religious cleric statements and joint visits to the Sri Lankan embassy helped contain the situation.” The business community of Sialkot is trying to compensate the family with $100,000 and a lifetime pension for the wife, he added.
There seem to be no short term business repercussions of a mob murdering a man, perhaps for personal vengeance under the guise of the blasphemy law, but it can have longer-term consequences for when the GSP Plus is reviewed.
“It will figure somewhere when Pakistan’s status is being considered,” said Dr Manzoor Ahmed, a former ambassador to the World Trade Organisation .“These things have been adding up. The European Union would like to exercise some pressure, especially with regards to the blasphemy law.”
Earlier this year, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for a review of the GSP plus status granted to Pakistan in view of the “alarming” increase in the use of blasphemy accusations in the country.
The European Parliament highlights that while there have never been official executions, Pakistan’s blasphemy laws incite harassment, violence and murder against those accused. Regardless of the judicial procedures, people accused of blasphemy fear for their lives though it is widely known that the laws are manipulated for the personal interests of the accuser. A lot of those accused are human rights defenders, journalists, artists or the most marginalised people in society.
GSP Plus is viewed as a tool to enforce human rights in less developed countries. Those who point to the white portion of the flag or sprout quranic ayats and hadiths claiming that minorities are protected in Pakistan belong in straitjackets for their delusions.
A whole host of laws and policy measures exist on paper to broadcast Pakistan’s theoretical progress of human rights but the Sialkot incident is just one among many; there is no doubt that there will be another Priyantha Kumara in a few months, if not weeks.
And while business continues as usual, beyond words of condemnation and the furious Twitterati there will be no change. The reckoning, if and when it comes, in terms of a formal boycott of Pakistan’s products, sanctions, or removal of GSP Plus status, will also be more on political grounds than actual outrage.  
Brexit has ensured that the United Kingdom, an ally historically, has no say in the GSP Plus review process. Southern Europe limited competes with some of Pakistan’s exports. France can hardly be expected to look kindly at a country that is placating a party that has been staging violent anti-France protests and demanding the expulsion of the French envoy.
To say nothing of the Muslim beheading the French school teacher Samuel Paty who showed caricatures in his class. The blasphemy mania has infected other countries with teachers in France claiming they are more cautious with what they say, according to media reports.
Punishing Pakistan through the withdrawal of GSP Plus is a line that European countries may pursue further down the road. And if the governments choose to exercise restraint, the consumers may not be so forgiving.
“On the purchase side, consumers check the label before buying a product. At least for a while there is a reaction and potential buyers shift to a competitor from another country,” said Dr Ahmed.     
Regardless of the horrific nature of the most ghastly crimes in Pakistan, without an uproar from the international community that inflicts monetary damage, the worst among us continue to feel sanctioned. If the West chooses to inflict penalties high enough for the pain to be felt in the upper echelons of the powers that be, only then they will feel the need to influence the narrative on the ground. But for the moment, business continues as usual with no change on the horizon.
