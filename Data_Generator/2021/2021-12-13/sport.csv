0,"Leicester thrash sorry Newcastle, West Ham held by Burnley",Liverpool remained in second place with Chelsea another point back in third.,"LONDON: Leicester City left Newcastle United still rooted in the Premier League relegation zone with a 4-0 thrashing of the Magpies on Sunday, while West Ham United’s Champions League ambitions were dented by a 0-0 draw at Burnley. 
Despite being hit by a coronavirus outbreak that left Brendan Rodgers without seven players, the Foxes gave Eddie Howe another reminder of the task he faces to keep Newcastle in the top flight as Youri Tielemans struck twice at the King Power. 
Howe will be able to call on the resources of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund in the January transfer window and results elsewhere this weekend mean they remain just three points adrift of safety. 
But Newcastle face Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United in their next three games and, on this form, will be lucky to escape that run without another severe hit to their goal difference. 
Leicester had won just two of their previous nine games in all competitions and were dumped out of the Europa League by Napoli on Thursday. 
However, they got the break they needed to edge in front before half-time when James Maddison engineered contact with Javier Manquillo to win a penalty. 
With Jamie Vardy watching on from the bench, Tielemans took responsibility from the spot to open the scoring seven minutes before half-time. 
Patson Daka’s form has seen him earn his spot ahead of Vardy in recent weeks in the Premier League and Zambian had the easiest of tasks to roll in his seventh goal of the season from Harvey Barnes’ unselfish pass to double Leicester’s lead. 
Tielemans rounded off a fine team move for his second of the afternoon before Maddison’s fine finish compounded Newcastle’s pain five minutes from time. 
Victory lifts Leicester to eighth and back in the fight for a place in the top four while West Ham wasted the chance to extend their advantage over the chasing pack. 
The Hammers have won just one of their last five league games as Nick Pope frustrated David Moyes’ men with a string of saves at Turf Moor. 
West Ham edged one point ahead of fifth-placed Manchester United, but Tottenham Hotspur, who are not in action this weekend due to their own Covid outbreak, are just two points back with two games in hand. 
A point also does little to aid Burnley’s hopes of survival as they remain in 18th, but are now just two points adrift of safety. 
On Saturday, league leaders Manchester City and title challengers Liverpool and Chelsea all needed penalties to secure victories on Saturday, leaving the top of the table unchanged. 
City maintained their one-point lead after Raheem Sterling’s 100th league goal secured a 1-0 home win over Wolverhampton Wanderers in the early kickoff, and chasing duo Liverpool and Chelsea responded with slim victories of their own. 
Aston Villa manager Steven Gerrard’s return to Anfield nearly dealt a damaging blow to Liverpool’s title hopes but Mohamed Salah’s penalty in the 67th minute secured a 1-0 win for the Reds after goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez frustrated the hosts for much of the game. 
“The first 75 minutes was incredible football,” said Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp. “We played in the spaces we wanted to play but we did not finish the situations which is tricky.” 
At Stamford Bridge, Jorginho had to convert two spot kicks the second in the fourth minute of stoppage time for Chelsea to beat Leeds 3-2. His first penalty in the 58th put Chelsea 2-1 up but Joe Gelhardt equalised in the 83rd. 
“We deserved to win but of course its lucky when you have a late goal in [injury] time,” Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel said. “But coming back twice is very impressive and Im very happy we turned things around.” 
Liverpool remained in second place with Chelsea another point back in third. 
A Cristiano Ronaldo penalty in the 75th minute helped Manchester United to an unconvincing 1-0 win at bottom team Norwich City, their second successive league victory under interim manager Ralf Rangnick. 
Arsenal, who are one point behind United in sixth, bounced back from two straight losses by beating Southampton 3-0 at home.

The chestnut filly Stunning One was withdrawn from the race as she did not enter the starting gate.

Sunday was a good day for the only female rider Alishba Mohsin, who was provided an opportunity to ride on two mounts that showed that sanity has prevailed as racing mafia did not interfere to dislodge her at the starting gates as has unfortunately happened on some occasions previously.

Montpellier’s third straight win extended their unbeaten record against Brest in the top flight, and lifted Olivier Dall’Oglio’s players to fourth in the standings. Brest are 12th in the standings, four points behind Montpellier. 
Brest played with pace in the first half but could not convert their chances and were punished just before the interval as Elye Wahi headed home a a cross from Teji Savanier. 
Montpellier striker Stephy Mavididi made it 2-0 three minutes into the second half with a superb half-volley. Junior Sambia gave more lustre to the win at the hour mark and Valere Germain completed the rout five minutes from time with a shot to goalkeeper Marco Bizot’s right side. 
In his first match in charge, interim coach Julien Sable could not turn last-placed St Etienne’s fortunes around at Reims. St Etienne were reduced to 10 men just before the interval when Denis Bouanga was dismissed and lost 2-0. 
Hugo Ekitike was instrumental in Reims’ win, first provoking a penalty converted by El Bilal Toure before assisting Nathanal Mbuku for his team’s second goal.

6,Max Verstappen wins first F1 title with last lap pass of Lewis Hamilton,"“Congratulations to Max and to his team, I think he did an amazing job this year,” Hamilton said.","

FORMULA ONE world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull celebrates with the trophy at the podium on Sunday.—AFP

 
ABU DHABI: The most dramatic Formula One season in years ended, of course, in one of the most dramatic finishes possible when Max Verstappen snatched the world championship away from Lewis Hamilton with a pass on the final lap of the Abu Dhabi GP. 
Mercedes filed two protests after the race. 
Hamilton was five laps away from passing Michael Schumacher in the record books with an eighth championship Sunday until a crash gave Verstappen and Red Bull one final chance. 
Whatever Hamilton said over his radio when Nicholas Latifi crashed to bring out the safety car was only played as one long beep to cover the expletives. 
F1 race director Michael Masi took his time figuring out how to conclude the race before controversially settling on one final lap of racing to decide the title. Verstappen started the final lap just behind Hamilton, chasing him through the first four turns. 
Verstappen made his pass in the fifth turn and Hamilton had one last shot. He pulled his Mercedes even with the Red Bull but couldn’t clear Verstappen, who surged ahead to become the first Dutch world champion. 
Verstappen and Red Bull celebrated in a champagne soak, received hugs from his fellow competitors including Hamilton and Hamilton’s father and made his way to the DJ stand at Yas Marina Circuit and jumped wildly up and down to the music. 
“It’s just insane, I mean, my goal when I was little was to become a Formula One driver and to go for wins, to be on the podium,” said Verstappen. “When they play the national anthem, you want it to be yours and when you stand here and they tell you that you are the world champion, it’s something incredible and special.”

It was a fitting end to a season that saw the two contenders go wheel-to-wheel over 22 races spanning four continents and arrive in Abu Dhabi tied in the championship standings. It marked the first time the contenders were equal at the season finale since 1974. 
“Congratulations to Max and to his team, I think he did an amazing job this year,” Hamilton said. 
This bitter rivalry between Mercedes and Red Bull got the ending it deserved one that left the victor speechless. 
“Oh my God!” Verstappen screamed over his radio as he crossed the finish line.
“You are the world champion! The world champion!” screamed back Red Bull boss Christian Horner. 
“Let’s do this for another 10 or 15 years!” Verstappen replied. 
Red Bull won their first F1 title since 2013; Mercedes had won every championship since.
The mood was far different in the Mercedes camp, where Hamilton sat motionless in his car for several moments as other drivers made their way to congratulate Verstappen. The defeat ended his reign of four consecutive titles and denied Hamilton a chance to pass Schumacher as best all-time in F1. 
Mercedes boss Toto Wolff was incredulous on the radio, demanding the last lap be reinstated. 
“Toto, it’s called a motor race,” Masi tersely replied. “We want car racing.”
Hamilton received a long hug from his father, who then went to the Red Bull garage and hugged both Verstappen and Verstappen’s father. Jos Verstappen was himself a former F1 driver and raised his 24-year-old son to become a world champion. 
Mission accomplished and Red Bull celebrated by playing ‘We are the Cham­pions’ in its garage.

7,Pakistan start as heavy favourites against virus-depleted Windies,"“We want to carry the momentum and the confidence that we have gained during the World Cup,” says captain Babar Azam.","

KARACHI: If being shorn of their top players due to injury or otherwise wasn’t enough for the West Indies, Covid-19 has robbed them of three more players for the Twenty20 series against Pakistan starting from Monday. 
Pacer Sheldon Cottrell and all-rounders Roston Chase and Kyle Mayers all tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday night, reducing the 15-man travelling party for the three T20s to 12. 
From those remaining ones, only batter Rovman Powell and bowling all-rounder Odean Smith have any experience of playing in Pakistan — the duo being in the West Indies team which last toured the country in 2018. 
But for skipper Nicolas Pooran, who is only leading the side after Kieron Pollard failed to recover from an injury, it’s an opportunity for fresh faces to come to the fore.
“Obviously Pakistan are playing very good cricket and are at the top of their game,” Pooran said during a virtual news conference on Sunday about Babar Azam’s side who come into the series with a 3-0 whitewash of Bangladesh which followed their barnstorming run into the semi-finals of the Twenty20 World Cup. 
“But this is T20 cricket and it can be anyone’s game. Even the top players can have a bad day so I’m not too worried about the inexperience of my side. Of course we understand the Pakistan will have the crowd behind them but at the end of the day it’s a game of cricket.”
After West Indies’ disappointing T20 World Cup campaign, where they exited in the group stage in a meek surrender of their title, star all-rounder Dwayne Bravo hung up his boots while swashbuckling opener Chris Gayle also hinted he was headed towards retirement. 
Shimron Hetmyer, Evin Lewis, Lendl Simmons, and Andre Russell opted out of the Pakistan tour due to personal reasons and from the World Cup squad, only Pooran and Oshane Thomas remain with Chase sidelined by virus.
“It’s very unfortunate that we had the Covid-19 cases,” Pooran said. “It has affected our original plans but now the other guys have the opportunity to showcase their talent. I want to see how we play together and I’m excited to see what’s going to happen.” 
Babar, meanwhile, warned his side against dropping their guard against the West Indies despite starting the series as heavy favourites. 
“We are not going to take them lightly because they didn’t bring their best players,” Babar told a virtual news conference on Sunday. 
“Those who are here are of international standard … they’ve played in the Caribbean Premier League and international matches as well so we have to give our 100 per cent. 
“We want to carry the momentum and the confidence that we have gained during the World Cup and the tour of Bangladesh.” 
He sympathised with the West Indies, who are carrying on with the series despite the positive virus cases. 
“It’s a difficult time for a team when a player tests positive,” Babar said. “It’s difficult to live in isolation and we have gone through this. Lots of negative things do come in your mind when you are alone in the room and the team combination also gets affected.”
Babar has led from the front with his runs with Pakistan having won eight of their last nine T20 Internationals — the only defeat coming against eventual T20 World Cup champions Australia in the semi-finals. 
Babar was also hopeful that the West Indies series will aid the return of international cricket in Pakistan. 
Pakistan cricket was rocked in September when New Zealand abandoned their tour due to a security alert in September with England withdrawing their team from their series in October. 
“It is important that this series is going ahead,” said Babar, “and we appreciate West Indies for coming to play because there were fears whether teams will tour Pakistan or not.” 
With the government allowing full capacity crowds at the National Stadium for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic, Babar was hopeful fans will get to see some quality cricket.
“I’m sure with 100 per cent crowds allowed, we will have entertaining cricket,” he said, with the second T20 coming on Tuesday and the final game of the series being played on Thursday, ahead of the three-match One-day International series. 
Squads: 
PAKISTAN: Babar Azam (captain), Shadab Khan, Asif Ali, Fakhar Zaman, Haider Ali, Haris Rauf, Iftikhar Ahmed, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Hasnain, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Rizwan, Mohammad Wasim Jr, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shahnawaz Dahani, Usman Qadir  
WEST INDIES: Nicholas Pooran (captain), Shai Hope, Darren Bravo, Dominic Drakes, Akeal Hosein, Brandon King, Gudakesh Motie, Romario Shepherd, Odean Smith, Oshane Thomas, Hayden Walsh Jr, Rovman Powell.

8,"Michael Atherton, Alastair Cook say poor preparation behind England’s Ashes defeat","“If you look at England in the last dozen Tests... they’ve become so reliant on Root,” says former skipper Michael Atherton.","LONDON: Former England skipper Michael Atherton said their over-reliance on Test skipper Joe Root and a lack of preparation had hurt them in the opening clash of their five-match Ashes series against Australia, which the tourists lost by nine wickets.
England had clawed their way back into the contest riding a 162-run partnership between Root (89) and Dawid Malan (82) but they collapsed on Saturday, losing eight wickets to suffer a heavy defeat at the Gabba in Brisbane.
“If you look at England in the last dozen Tests... they’ve become so reliant on Root,” Atherton, who captained England in 54 tests, wrote in his column for Sky Sports.
“And if England are going to do well in Australia, you’d think he’s going to have to have a productive series, but he needs others around him to support him as well.
“Malan batted well ... but England’s batting in both innings, other than that one partnership, was poor and that’s going to cost them. They were completely under-prepared, and I have a lot of sympathy for them in this regard.
“There is the COVID pandemic which has necessitated the kind of schedule they had but then the torrential rains in Queensland just knocked out the minimal preparation they had been given or had given themselves.”
Former England captain Alastair Cook agreed that wet weather during the build-up to the game had not helped.
“You could say that Australia have endured similar issues but that’s not quite true,” Cook wrote in The Sunday Times.
“We had some figures on BT Sport which showed that since the end of the English summer, their batsmen had faced about 3,600 balls in competitive cricket, while England’s top order had faced less than a quarter of that.”

Broad and fellow pace stalwart James Anderson share 1,156 Test wickets between them but the duo were rested for the Gabba Test, which England lost by nine wickets to trail 1-0 in the five-match series.
“Over the past 12 months, Anderson and I tried to ensure we were as fit as could be in the current Covid climate, ready to go and available for all five Tests in Australia. I think we ticked that box,” Broad wrote in his Daily Mail column.
“But England selection isn’t in the hands of players. It’s in those of people who have to make choices based on conditions and the balance of the team and our job now, with four matches to go, is to be ready for the next of the series in Adelaide.
“... I’ve been left out on numerous occasions and sometimes it comes as a real surprise. This was less of a surprise, maybe because I wasn’t in the team for the previous series against India due to a calf injury.”
Broad, 35, said he could have made a difference in bowler-friendly conditions in Brisbane.
“Of course, I was disappointed not to play but I realise this series is a marathon and not a sprint,” Broad said.
“Never have five Test matches been as bunched up as this and it will be exhausting, so realistically I don’t think any seamer will play all five.
“Do I want to be on the field at Hobart in the fifth Test with the opportunity to do something special? Of course. And if I’m not needed before then, we will have done bloody well.”
The second Test starts on Thursday in Adelaide.

Should he miss the game which starts on Thursday, Jhye Richardson is expected to take his place in the team.
Hazlewood underwent a scan on Friday but bowled on Saturday when Australia cruised to comprehensive victory to go 1-0 up in the five-match series.
Captain Pat Cummins said after the match that Hazlewood’s injury was nothing too serious.
