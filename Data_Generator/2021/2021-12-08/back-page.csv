0,GB’s former chief judge confirms contents of affidavit,Willing to confront ex-CJP Nisar to ascertain its veracity; IHC CJ directs Rana Shamim to submit affidavit by 13th,"ISLAMABAD: Former chief judge of Gilgit-Baltistan Rana Mohammad Shamim on Monday confirmed the contents of his affidavit accusing former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar of delaying the release of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz.  
In response to a show-cause notice issued by Chief Justice Athar Minallah of the Islamabad High Court to Rana Shamim and others over the publication of the affidavit in an English language newspaper, the ex-chief judge of GB explained the “compelling force” behind the execution of the statement in the form of an affidavit and expressed his willingness to confront former CJP Nisar to ascertain veracity of the affidavit.  
In the statement, Mr Shamim claimed that he had neither circulated nor shared the affidavit with anyone. “The only compelling force behind executing this statement in the form of an affidavit was a promise with my late wife before her death that I must get this fact reduced in writing and preserve the same to set the record straight,” he said, adding: “Statement was recorded in the form of an affidavit because of tremendous emotional pressure and to honour promise made by me to my late wife before her death.”  

Willing to confront ex-CJP Nisar to ascertain its veracity; IHC CJ directs Rana Shamim to submit affidavit by 13th  

As per the statement, Mr Shamim’s wife died on June 4 this year and after that his first foreign visit was to the United States and while returning home he stayed in London for two days where he recorded the statement, notarised it and handed it over to his grandson for keeping it in a locker.  
The former GB judge stated that he “has no clue or knowledge how the affidavit came in the possession of the reporter who actually published it as a news item”. He said that as a practice the copy of such statement was retained by the notary public in London for record. However, he added, this fact could best be answered by those who had released this statement or shared it with Ansar Abbasi — the reporter who published the story.  
It may be mentioned that Rana Shamim claimed in the affidavit that Justice Nisar had during his visit to Gilgit-Baltistan called a judge of the IHC and asked him to ensure that Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz were not granted bail before the 2018 general election.  
The statement submitted to the IHC said: “The events mentioned in the affidavit occurred on July 15, 2018, around evening time, approximately 6pm while we were having tea and refreshments together at the official rest house of the Supreme Appellate Court of Gilgit-Baltistan.”  
Mr Shamim expressed his willingness to testify the affidavit even in front of the former CJP, saying that he is “ready to state the facts mentioned in statement on solemn oath and the answering respondent [Rana Shamim] is ready to confront the person mentioned in the affidavit i.e. former Chief Justice of Pakistan Mian Saqib Nisar”. The ex-CJ of GB reiterated that he never intended to scandalise or ridicule the judiciary and requested the court to withdraw the show-cause notice.  
Advocate Lateef Afridi appeared before the IHC on behalf of Rana Shamim.  
Chief Justice Athar Minallah observed that the affidavit had cast serious aspersions on all the judges of the IHC. He asked Mr Afridi to act as amicus curiae, besides representing Mr Shamim.  
Attorney General Khalid Jawed Khan argued that the timing of executing the affidavit was important as an IHC division bench was supposed to resume hearing on an appeal which was linked with the events narrated in Mr Shamim’s sworn statement.  
He informed the court that he had written a letter to the ex-chief judge of GB for swift transportation of the affidavit from the UK through the Pakistan High Commission there.  
Justice Minallah directed Mr Shamim to submit the affidavit by December 13 and warned that the court would otherwise frame charges.

The minister took action on a video that went viral on social media showing the train driver stopping and buying yoghurt from a shop. 
After the video clip invited criticism of the railways department, which has been in trouble of late due to various issues of accidents, passenger safety and declining revenue, the minister took action and ordered the Pakistan Railways Lahore administration to suspend driver Rana Mohammad Shehzad and his assistant Iftikhar Hussain. 
“I will not tolerate such events in the future and allow anyone to use national assets for personal use,” the minister warned in a statement.

They had also been barred from taking selfies, recording video and audio messages on their phones in all trains (passenger and goods). 
Respective divisional heads had also been directed to keep tracking crew members of a train (especially drivers and their assistants) and take prompt action if someone was flouting the orders.

2,ECP meets today to discuss PTI foreign funding case report,"After in-camera session, the commission will decide about public hearing of the case.","ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is meeting on Wednesday to take up a number of issues, including the report of the scrutiny committee which was constituted to audit foreign funds of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). 
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja will preside over the in-camera meeting, informed sources in the Commission told Dawn on Tuesday. 
The ECP’s Director General of Law Muhammad Arshad will brief the commission on the report as head of the scrutiny committee, which was constituted in March 2019 to audit foreign funds of the PTI. Informed sources said that after an in-camera review of the report, the ECP would make a decision about public hearing of the case. 
The committee submitted its report to the Commission last month, around six months after the last deadline given to it by the ECP in September last year. 

After in-camera session, the commission will decide about public hearing of the case 

The foreign funding case against the PTI has been lingering since November 2014 when it was filed by the party’s founding member and now dissident Akbar Babar. 
In his petition, Mr Babar had alleged serious financial irregularities in the ruling party’s accounts, including illegal sources of funding, concealment of bank accounts within the country and abroad, money laundering and use of private bank accounts of party employees as a front to receive illegal donations from the Middle East. 
The ECP had in September last year through an order trashed an “incomplete” report of its scrutiny committee on the foreign funding case, declaring that the report was neither complete nor well detailed. 
“The scrutiny committee on the basis of documents provided by both parties and collected from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has neither scrutinised the record nor evaluated the evidence from the documents and failed to form a definite opinion,” the ECP had noted. 
While reprimanding the panel, it had observed that it was the duty and responsibility of the committee to scrutinise the authenticity, reliability and credibility of each and every document(s) submitted to it by both parties.  
It said the committee had the authority to approach proper forums, sources and people to confirm the authenticity or otherwise of the documents. 
“Admittedly, law provides criteria of authenticity and credibility for scrutiny of the documents, but the committee has not adopted a proper procedure in this respect,” the ECP had observed.

3,Ulema demand strict action against those involved in Sialkot incident,CII declaration affirms there is no place of extremism in Islam,"ISLAMABAD: Ulema belonging to the four mainstream schools of thought on Tuesday denounced self-declared vigilantism and demanded strict legal action against those behind lynching of Sri Lankan national Priyantha Kumara in Sialkot last week. 
The clerics not only termed the killing an extrajudicial murder but also called it un-Islamic after a condolence meeting with Sri Lankan High Commissioner Mohan Wijewickrama at the Sri Lankan High Commission in Islamabad. 
The ulema’s delegation was led by Hafiz Tahir Ashrafi, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Religious Harmony and Middle East. He said that members of the delegation represented the country and they belonged to various schools of thought from all regions of the country. 
After the meeting with the Sri Lankan ambassador, the chairman of Council of Islamic Ideology (CII), Dr Qibla Ayaz, read out a joint declaration and said that the entire situation was against the teachings of holy Quran and Sunnah, the Constitution of Pakistan and the laws prevailing in the country. 

CII declaration affirms there is no place of extremism in Islam 

“It was an inhumane act and to accuse someone of blasphemy without proof is not in accordance with Sharia,” Dr Ayaz said. 
Dr Ayaz said accusing anyone of having committed blasphemy without proof was illegal. 
He said this act of some people had brought shame to the nation. 
The joint declaration said that strictest possible legal action must be taken against the culprits. 
The CII chairman said there was no place for extremism and violence in Islam. He urged religious scholars to play their role in uprooting the menace of extremism from society. 
The joint declaration said that Paigham-i-Pakistan was a national document under which all such violent actions had been banned. 
“Today’s representative meeting of ulema declares that there is no place for violence and extremism in Islam,” the declaration said. 
Sri Lankan High Commis­sioner Wijewickrama called the Sialkot incident a horrific and horrendous act, but added that he was satisfied with arrests of suspects made so far and the launch of investigations. 
“At the same time, I have seen over the last three days that Pakistanis belonging to all walks of life have been condemning the sad incident,” the high commissioner said. 
He acknowledged that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had both assisted each other on a number of occasions, adding that the incident in Sialkot would not have any negative impact on relations between the two countries. 
“Our relations are very old and time-tested, since our independence as Pakistan became independent in 1947 and we became independent in 1948,” Mr Wijewickrama said, adding that Mr Kumara’s family would be provided an adequate compensation. 
The delegation included Maulana Abdul Khubair Azad, chairman of Ruet-i-Hilal Committee; Maulana Abul Khair Zubair, chairman of Milli Yakjehti Council; Hamid Saeed Kazmi, former minister of religious affairs; Mufti Taqi Usmani, Allama Amin Shaheedi, Allama Arif Wahidi and Senator Sajid Mir.
