0,Everton end barren run with fightback against Arsenal,LIVERPOOL: Another night of frustration looked in store for the Toffees as  Richarlison had two goals marginally...,"LIVERPOOL: Another night of frustration looked in store for the Toffees as  Richarlison had two goals marginally ruled out by VAR for offside either  side of Martin Odegaard’s opener for the Gunners. 
But Richarlison was not to be denied a third time when he headed  home before Demarai Gray smashed home a thunderous strike in stoppage  time for a deserved win.
On a night of protest then jubilation inside Goodison Park, Everton  ended their eight-match winless run by rallying for a 2-1 victory over  Arsenal on Monday and it was all thanks to a winger whose offseason  arrival from Bayer Leverkusen for 1.7 million pounds is  proving a bargain. 
Gray sent in a fierce strike from the edge of the area that struck  the crossbar and was headed in by Richarlison off the rebound for  Everton’s equaliser in the 79th minute. 
Then, from further out, Gray cut inside from the left and unleashed  a right-footed shot with even more venom in the second minute of  stoppage time. The ball flew in off the inside of the post and Gray  celebrated by removing his jersey and wading into a section of fans  beside the field. 
It sparked wild celebrations inside the stadium at the end of a  match that featured a walkout by some fans after 27 minutes, in a signal  of their unhappiness at the Everton board’s running of the club amid  the 27th season without a trophy. 
Some of the fans were seen making their way towards the exits inside Goodison as play continued, with the score at 0-0. 
The majority that hung around saw its team fall behind again thanks  to Martin Odegaards’ volley in the second minute of first-half injury  time, which put Arsenal on course for a win to climb back into fifth  place. 
The visitors rode their luck, with Richarlison having two goals a  header in the 43rd and a low finish in the 57th ruled out by video  review because of marginal offside decisions. 
The Brazil forward kept plugging away and got his reward with the  equaliser inspired by Gray, who then produced the crowning moment of the  game. 
“It was a crazy moment, my best moment here so far,” Gray said. 
“It  was important to get that win. We have gone through a bad patch but we  stuck together.” 
It was Everton’s first win since Sept 25 and moved the team eight points clear of the relegation zone. 
“It is clear when the fans, the players, everybody sticks together,  we are stronger,” Everton manager Rafa Benitez said.  
“The reaction of  the team to the goals that were disallowed and conceding a goal at the  end of the first half, we still scored goals and reacted.”
Arsenal will regret late chances squandered by substitute strikers  Eddie Nketiah, who headed against the base of the post from point-blank  range when the score was 1-1, and Pierre-Emerick Aubam­eyang, who  side-footed wide with one of the last kicks of the game. 
Aubameyang, Arsenal’s club captain, was left out of the team and  came on only as a substitute after Nketiah had been introduced a  decision by manager Mikel Arteta that might be viewed as something of a  snub to his star player. 
It was a second straight loss for Arsenal in the northwest of England, after a 3-2 at Manchester United on Thursday. 
“Its hard to say exactly what happened,” Odegaard said.
“We have to do  better when we have that lead. We stopped playing and gave them the  game they wanted to play.”
The outcome left Arsenal seventh on 23 points from 15 games, four points outside the top four.

3,Olivier returns to SA squad for India Tests,JOHANNESBURG: Fast bowler Duanne Olivier was on Tuesday named in a 21-man South African squad for a three-Test ...,"JOHANNESBURG: Fast bowler Duanne Olivier was on Tuesday named in a 21-man South African squad for a three-Test series against India, starting in Centurion on Dec 26.
The 29-year-old signed a Kolpak deal with Yorkshire in 2019 and declared that he wanted to qualify for England. He spent three seasons with the English county.
The strongly-built fast bowler returned to the South African domestic system this season and in four first-class matches for the Johannesburg-based Lions team has taken 28 wickets at an average of 11.10.
Olivier took 48 wickets in 10 Tests before signing for Yorkshire, including a man of the series performance of 24 wickets at an average of 14.70 in 2018-19.
Olivier’s success was built on hostile, short-pitched bowling on helpful pitches in Centurion, Johannesburg and Cape Town — the venues for the upcoming series against India.
He had a relatively modest return of 75 wickets at an average of 32.42 in 25 first-class matches for Yorkshire.
The 21 players named by Cricket South Africa provide cover in all departments in case of injuries.
The players will go into a bio-secure environment for the duration of the Test series.
There are six uncapped players in an expanded squad, including three fast bowlers in Glenton Stuurman, Marco Jansen and Sisanda Magala.
Other uncapped players are batsmen Sarel Erwee and Ryan Rickelton and off-spinner Prenelan Subrayen.
The second Test will be played in Johannesburg from Jan 3-7 followed by the third Test in Cape Town from Jan 11-15.
Squad: Dean Elgar (captain), Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wicket-keeper), Sarel Erwee, Beuran Hendricks, Marco Jansen, George Linde, Sisanda Magala, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje, Duanne Olivier, Keegan Petersen, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Glenton Stuurman, Prenelan Subrayen, Rassie van der Dussen, Kyle Verreynne (wicket-keeper).

4,Injured Kane Williamson out for at least two months,His elbow tendon injury rules him out of January’s two-Test home series against Bangladesh.,"MUMBAI: New Zealand captain Kane Williamson will be sidelined by an elbow tendon injury for at least two months, coach Gary Stead said on Tuesday, ruling him out of January’s two-Test home series against Bangladesh.
The recurring injury also forced Williamson to miss the second Test against India in Mumbai, where New Zealand went down by a record 372 runs on Monday to lose the series 1-0.
“Kane’s going along okay,” Stead told reporters from Mumbai on the eve of the squad’s return home.  “I said right from the start, I expected it to be a sustained period of time.
“Last time ... was about eight or nine weeks. I expect it’s some­where in that timeframe again.”
Stead said surgery on the joint was unlikely, but he was also reluctant to predict that Williamson would be fit to face South Africa in two Tests in February-March.
“We’re trying not to put a timeframe on it,” Stead added.  “It’s all about the load on the elbow and when you’re in the test arena, the extra time in training and batting as well is what tipped him over the edge, I guess.
“Kane’s doing it tough, don’t get me wrong. He hates the thought of missing any cricket, let alone Test cricket for New Zealand.”
The India series was the first in the Black Caps’ defence of the World Test Championship title that they won this year.
While clearly unhappy that the side were bowled out for 62 in their first innings in Mumbai, Stead was pleased that the drawn first Test in Kanpur would earn them some championship points.
“A lot of teams come here and struggle, so to pick up any points from here ... was a really good achievement,” he said. “India were just better than us in their conditions.”

Australian Barty, who won the title in 2019, won a tour-leading five titles this year including the second Grand Slam trophy of her career at Wimbledon where she beat Czech Karolina Pliskova in the final.
She also defended her title at Miami and triumphed in Melbourne, Stuttgart and Cincinnati to secure her third year-end number one ranking in a row.
Raducanu, 19, entered the US Open as a qualifier ranked 150th in the world and ended it as Britain’s first female Grand Slam champion for 44 years.
Czech Barbora Krejcikova took the WTA prize for the Most Improved Player of the Year following a stellar season in which she won the French Open singles crown.
She also excelled in doubles with playing partner Katerina Siniakova, with the pair earning the Doubles Team of the Year award which they also won in 2018. Carla Suarez Navarro was named the Comeback Player of the Year award.
The 33-year-old announced in September, 2020 that she was being treated for early stage Hodgkin lymphoma and underwent months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before returning at the French Open in June.

6,"PCB, PTV Sports resolve dispute over broadcast rights",Sources say it was decided that PTV will have the right to broadcast Pakistan’s international matches within country till 2023.,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board and the Pakistan Television Sports administration have resolved their dispute over broadcasting rights in Pakistan with PTV Sports having decided to withdraw its legal cases against the PCB and preferring an out-of-court settlement.
Sources told Dawn that a virtual meeting between the PCB chairman Ramiz Raja and the PTV administration was held on Tuesday where it was decided that PTV will have the rights to broadcast Pakistan’s international matches within the country till 2023.
However, the percentage from the revenue of PTV Sports through those matches has been changed in favour of the PCB. Now, the PCB will receive 72 percent of the revenue which PTV’s share is down to 28 percent from 42.5 percent previously. The out-of-country broadcasting rights of international matches are still with the PCB.
PCB and PTV Sports had signed a three-year satellite broadcast deal and a separate agreement to secure cable distribution with I-Media Communication Services in September last year with both parties — the PCB was under the chairman of Ehsan Mani at that time — signing the agreement at the Prime Minister House in the presence of Prime Minister Imran Khan. 
It was forecast that PCB would earn in excess of US$200million during the three-year period through cable operators but the PCB was unable to earn a single penny from it during the last year as the cable operators’ association was not on board and was not ready to earn money for the PCB or PTV Sports.
With the PCB not getting any income through the deal with PTV Sports, the deal was suspended only for PTV Sports to file a petition against the PCB decision. Now, though, both parties have reached at a mutual understanding.
The new deal has no link with the matches of the HBL Pakistan Super League as it is not an international but a domestic event of the PCB.

7,Jimmy Anderson out as Pat Cummins warns Australia ‘tough to beat’,England are keen to manage the 39-year-old’s workload for what will be a gruelling five-match series.,"BRISBANE: Bowling great Jimmy Anderson was on Tuesday left out of the England team for the first Ashes Test as Pat Cummins warned his Australian side boasting some of  “the all-time greats” would be tough to beat.
The home team head into the Ashes opener in Brisbane on Wednesday defending the hallowed urn and with their arch-rivals having a dismal record in Australia, losing nine of their last 10 Tests.
The task for Joe Root’s side was made harder on the eve of the Ashes when veteran Anderson — Test cricket’s most prolific fast bowler with 632 wickets — was not named in England’s 12-man match squad for the opening clash at the Gabba.
Anderson was not risked after reportedly suffering a minor calf problem, although England did not give any reason for his omission.
But wicket-keeper Jos Buttler told the BBC:  “Jimmy’s not going to play but he is fit. It’s just precautionary.”
England are keen to manage the 39-year-old’s workload for what will be a gruelling five-match series, with the second Test starting in Adelaide in just nine days’ time.
That will be a pink-ball, day-night match with conditions expected to be more helpful to Anderson’s swing bowling.
His absence leaves England to choose four bowlers from Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Ollie Robinson, Stuart Broad and Jack Leach to form the attack alongside returning all-rounder Ben Stokes, who has barely played since July.
England were already without injured pacemen Jofra Archer, who is recovering from an elbow injury, and Olly Stone who has undergone back surgery.
A decision on whether to include spinner Leach or go for an all-seam attack will be made after a last look at the Gabba wicket before the toss on Wednesday morning.
Higher up the batting order, Haseeb Hameed won the race to open the innings with Rory Burns ahead of Zak Crawley, while Ollie Pope was preferred to Jonny Bairstow at number six.
“He [Anderson] obviously a great player and it’s a shame that he won’t be out there tomorrow, but it doesn’t change what we are going to do,” said new Australian captain Cummins.
Cummins, who took the reins when Tim Paine quit over a text-messaging scandal, nominated Root, the world’s number one Test batsman, as the key wicket for Australia.
“He’s going to be right up there as the biggest wicket, he’s had a really good last 12 months or so, but I wouldn’t necessarily say he’s going to make it or break it for them,” he said.
Cummins did suggest England could struggle against an Australia side that includes superstar batsmen Steve Smith and David Warner and bowling giants Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon.
“I look around our team and we’ve got a pretty special side,” he said, although Australia haven’t played a Test since January due to Covid.
“We’ve got some of the greats of all time of Australian cricket in our changing room and when you get most of them clicking we’re going to be a pretty tough team to beat.
“We get along really well and have a lot of fun, so hopefully a tight-knit group. We are enjoying our cricket and we’re relentless when we have our chance to play,” he added.
England haven’t won a Test in Brisbane since 1986 and have only done so four times — twice in the 1930s, once against the Kerry Packer-weakened 1978-79 Australians and 35 years ago during Ian Botham’s heyday.
But Root insisted the first Test, where showers are forecast, would  “not define” their Ashes campaign.
“Avoiding defeat would be a brilliant start to the series, absolutely,” he told BBC Sport on Tuesday before the Anderson news was confirmed.
“In many respects we’ve got nothing to lose coming here for this series.
“Ultimately we’ve just got to concentrate on what’s in front of us right now and starting the Test match well, getting into the series and managing everything else that goes around an Ashes first morning and taking the game from there.” 
Squads:
AUSTRALIA: Marcus Harris, David Warner, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Pat Cummins (captain), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood
ENGLAND: Joe Root (captain), Stuart Broad, Rory Burns, Jos Buttler, Haseeb Hameed, Jack Leach, Dawid Malan, Ollie Pope, Ollie Robinson, Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes, Mark Wood.

The WTA 250 tournament, which is usually played in the first week of the year, was held last year before events in China were wiped out due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
The women’s tour has suspended its tournaments in China due to concerns over the treatment of former doubles world number one Peng Shuai.
It is unlikely the tournament would have gone ahead early this year anyway due to China’s travel restrictions.
The WTA said in a statement late on Monday that in the first half of next year the Tour will have five WTA 1000 events in Doha, Indian Wells, Miami, Madrid and Rome, along with eight WTA 500 events and at least 15 WTA 250 events.
“The 2022 WTA Tour calendar will once again provide a prestigious stage for the world’s best women’s tennis players to compete on,” WTA chairman Steve Simon said.
It is the second half of the year when the WTA calendar is usually more crowded with events in China, with the world’s most populous country hosting nine tournaments in 2019 -- the last full season before the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The reasons for his departure are not specified. According to the sports daily L’Equipe, Forget, 56, presented his resignation to the president of the FFT Gilles Moretton on Tuesday morning.
“Guy Forget, whose contract ends on Dec 31, 2021, is stepping down as director of the Roland-Garros tournament and of the Paris Masters. His successor for the Grand Slam will be announced in the coming days,” said the FFT in a statement.
The announcement comes just a month after Forget was cleared of any wrong-doing by the FFT’s ethics committee following his naming in an investigation into a tax avoidance scheme in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands.
Forget’s name was cited in early October in the Pandora Papers, an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), according to which he had benefitted from tax packages in the British Virgin Islands.
The FFT’s ethics committee cleared Forget on November 5  “in the absence of established tax evasion or other criminally reprehensible behaviour”.
The former French number one took over as director of the Masters in 2012 adding the French Open to his portfolio four years later.

Speaking at a book launch in Rome, 27-year-old Jacobs announced he would compete at the ISTAF outdoor event at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin on Feb 4.
Jacobs has yet to compete since winning gold in the 100 metres and 4x100m at the Tokyo Olympics this year.
He missed five Diamond League events that followed his Olympic triumph, including the two-day finale in Zurich on Sept 8-9.
Jacobs’ manager Marcello Magnani told Reuters at the time there were no injuries or other health reasons behind his decision to take a break.
“It is simply that Marcell has given so much this year, all he had, so to insist [on competing] would only mean risking an injury,” he added.

It was the fifth draw for Athletic during their winless streak, leaving the Basque Country club in ninth place after 16 matches. Their last league win was in October at home against Villarreal.
Athletic goalkeeper Unai Simn made several key saves, including in second-half stoppage time, to help the visitors avoid defeat against Getafe. Athletic have been held scoreless in four of their last five games.

Getafe started the season with seven consecutive defeats but have improved significantly lately. They have only one loss in their last six league games, and had won two straight at home.

The 20-time Grand Slam champion had cast doubt on whether he would defend his title at Melbourne Park next month, refusing to reveal whether he was inoculated against coronavirus.
However, he was listed as part of the five-man Serbia team when the draw was made for the ATP Cup in Sydney that will precede the opening major of the year.
Rafael Nadal was missing, with the Spanish fellow 20-time Grand Slam winner last month suggesting he would play an exhibition in Abu Dhabi this month, then another tournament before arriving in Melbourne for the Australian Open.
The only other absent top 20 player for the 16-team ATP Cup was injured Swiss great Roger Federer.
“The playing group enjoy representing their countries and to see 18 of the world’s top 20 players commit to the event is testament to that,” said tournament director Tom Larner.  “The event shows off the passion the playing group have for this format.”
An ATP statement accompanying the draw noted that top seed Serbia was  “headlined by world number Novak Djokovic”, who won three of the season’s four Grand Slams.
The 34-year-old ended his rollercoaster season with a Davis Cup defeat last week and then promised to make a decision on his Australian Open participation  “very soon”.
Organisers of the Australian Open have insisted only fully-vaccinated players will be allowed into the country, which saw Djokovic’s father Srdjan last month suggest his son  “probably won’t” play.
“Of course he would want to go with all his heart,” he told Serbian television.
“But I really don’t know if that will happen. Probably not under these conditions, with this blackmail and when it’s done that way.” Djokovic contracted Covid-19 during the ill-fated Adria Tour event he organised in the Balkans in June 2020, but said he did not suffer from any symptoms.
Russia are the defending ATP Cup champions after their team spearheaded by Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev swept past a Matteo Berrettini-led Italy in the final.
Djokovic’s Serbia won the inaugural event in 2020, overpowering the Nadal-led Spain.
The teams in next year’s US$10 million event, from Jan 1-9, are divided into four groups of four, playing across two Sydney venues — the Ken Rosewall Arena and Qudos Bank Arena — with each tie comprising two singles matches and one doubles.
Top seeds Serbia were grouped with Spain, Norway and Chile, while Russia will face Italy, Austria and home nation Australia.
Germany, led by reigning ATP Finals champion Alexander Zverev, headline Group C against Canada, Great Britain and the US, while Greece, featuring world number four Stefanos Tsitsipas, are in Group D with Poland, Argentina and Georgia.
It kicks off a bumper series of ATP and WTA tournaments in the lead-up to the Australian Open, beginning on Jan 17, with events across Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne.

15,Pak vs Ban: Tigers trying to avoid follow-on after Sajid Khan takes six,"After day three was washed out, Pakistan resumed the fourth day from 188-2 and declared at 300-4 after lunch.","DHAKA: Off-spinner Sajid Khan claimed a career-best 6-35 as Pakistan reduced Bangladesh to 76-7 and produced a glimmer of hope of forcing a result in the second and final Test on Tuesday. 
After day three was washed out, Pakistan resumed the fourth day from 188-2 and declared at 300-4 after lunch. Then spinners Sajid and Nauman Ali got to work until stumps was called an hour early because of bad light at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. Bangladesh trailed by 224 runs and still needed 25 runs to avoid the follow-on at the end of a dramatic day. 
“After the declaration, our target was to give us the best chance to win the game and attack relentlessly and that’s what we did,” Sajid said. 
“Fortunately, there was turn and bounce aplenty. We two spinners bowled in partnership. We will try to get the three wickets tomorrow and force them to bat again and win the game.”
Bangladesh’s last hope to avoid the follow-on was Shakib Al Hasan on 23. Taijul Islam was with him, the tailender yet to score after facing 10 balls. 
With the light insufficient to allow any more than just the one over from fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi, Sajid and Nauman bowled relentlessly in a desperate bid to win the rain-hit game.
Rain and bad light have eaten up the majority of the game and just 63.2 overs were possible in the last three days. 
Nauman was slightly luckless, ending up without a wicket, but he gave the control that allowed Sajid to rip through the Bangladesh lineup. 
Sajid dismissed all but skipper Mominul Haque, who was run out for 1 by a direct hit from Hasan Ali at point. 
The Bangladesh batsmen, however, also invited the trouble by playing rash shots as if it was a Twenty20 game. 
“The wicket was difficult and, here, we understand a defensive mindset won’t work,” said Najmul Hosain, who has top-scored for the side with 30. “So during batting, our plan was to play our natural game and score runs quickly but, unfortunately, the execution was not good.”
Opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy got a duck on his debut after poking at a flighted delivery to slip, and his opening partner Shadman Islam was baffled by extra bounce.
Mominul was run out, and Bangladesh went to tea at 22-3. 
Experienced batsman Mushfiqur Rahim deepened the crisis by playing a slog-sweep to gift his wicket for 5. 
Liton Das, who hit 114 and 59 in the first Test, was on 6 when he charged Sajid, while Mehidy Hasan was bowled for a duck while trying to sweep a delivery that turned sharply. 
Shakib fought back with some aggression of his own to hit three fours and survive a run out chance to give some small relief for Bangladesh. 
After a delayed start due to early morning rain and a wet outfield, Pakistan scored briskly in a bid to put pressure on Bangladesh. 
Babar Azam and Azhar Ali added only five runs to their partnership before it finished on 123 for the third wicket. Azhar top-edged a delivery from fast bowler Ebadot Hossain on 56, and Babar quickly followed, leg before on 76 to give fast bowler Khaled Ahmed his maiden Test wicket. 
Bangladesh were back in the contest, but Fawad Alam and Mohammad Rizwan played with caution to combine for a 107-run unbeaten fifth-wicket stand. Both of them reached half-centuries Rizwan on 53 and Alam on 50 when Babar declared the innings. 
Rizwan was given out twice, on zero and 12, off the bowling of Ebadot and Taijul Islam respectively, but on both occasions he survived on review. 
Taijul took the first two Pakistan wickets, on the opening day, before rain interrupted the game. 
Pakistan lead the two-Test series 1-0 after an eight-wicket win in Chittagong.
