0,Biden warns Putin of sanctions if Russia invades Ukraine,WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday the West was concerned...,"WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden told his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Tuesday the West was concerned Moscow would invade Ukraine and warned of “strong economic and other measures” as punishment should it start a military conflict, the White House said.
The two leaders held two hours of virtual talks on Ukraine and other disputes in a video call about US-Russian relations, which have sunk to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War.
The Kremlin, which said before Tuesday’s meeting that it did not expect any breakthroughs, has denied harbouring any intention to attack Ukraine and has said its troop posture is defensive.
Biden voiced the “deep concerns of the United States and our European allies about Russia’s escalation of forces surrounding Ukraine”, the White House said, and “made clear that the US and our allies will respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation”.  
Biden reiterated US support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, the White House said, and called for de-escalation and diplomacy. Putin and Biden agreed to have their teams follow up.
Russian TV footage showed Biden and Putin greeting each other in a friendly manner at the start of the virtual summit. The two leaders talked for almost two hours, according to the White House.
Both sides say they hope the two leaders can hold an in-person summit to discuss ties between the two nations, which have long-standing differences over Syria, US economic sanctions and alleged Russian cyber attacks on US companies. The Russian government issued a terse statement after the call. “Talks between Vladimir Putin and President of the United States Joseph Biden took place via videoconference,” it said.
US officials said before the conference that Biden would tell Putin that Russia and its banks could be hit with the toughest sanctions yet if it attacks Ukraine.
Sanctions, which one source said could target Russia’s biggest banks and Moscow’s ability to convert roubles into dollars and other currencies, are designed to dissuade Putin from using tens of thousands of troops massed near the Ukrainian border to attack its southern neighbour.
Moscow has voiced rising vexation over Western military aid to Ukraine, a fellow former Soviet republic that has tilted towards the West since a popular revolt toppled a pro-Russian president in 2014, and what it calls creeping Nato expansion.
Moscow has likewise questioned Ukrainian intentions and said it wants guarantees that Kiev will not use force to try to retake territory lost in 2014 to Russia-backed separatists, a scenario Ukraine has ruled out.
“We’re looking for good, predictable relations with the United States. Russia has never intended to attack anyone, but we have our concerns and we have our red lines,” said Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov before the talks.
Washington has accused Russia of massing troops near the border with Ukraine to intimidate an aspiring Nato member, suggesting it could be a repeat of Moscow’s 2014 playbook, when it seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine.
For Moscow, the growing Nato embrace of a neighbouring former Soviet republic _ and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia _ is a “red line” it will not allow to be crossed.

1,UAE to drop Friday as weekly holiday,DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates will shift to a working week of four and a half days with a Saturday-Sunday weekend...,"DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates will shift to a working week of four and a half days with a Saturday-Sunday weekend from the start of next year to better align its economy with global markets, but private companies will be free to choose their own working week. 
The oil-producing Gulf state, the region’s commercial, trade and tourism hub, currently has a Friday-Saturday weekend. From Jan 1, however, the weekend will start on Friday afternoon, including for schools, a government circular said. 
“Each company, depending on the sector they operate in and what suits and serves their business best, can choose the weekend they decide for their employees,” Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation Abdulrahman al-Awar said. 
Over the past year, the UAE has taken measures to make its economy more attractive to foreign investment and talent at a time of growing economic rivalry with Saudi Arabia. 
Addressing any religious sensitivities in the Muslim-ruled country, where expatriates make up most of the population, the government said work on Friday would end at 12 noon before weekly prayers, which would be unified across the UAE. 
It said the longer weekend would improve employees’ work-life balance and noted that several Muslim-majority nations, such as Indonesia and Morocco, have Saturday-Sunday weekends. 
The UAE said the move would “ensure smooth financial, trade and economic transactions with countries that follow a Saturday-Sunday weekend, facilitating stronger international business links and opportunities” for UAE-based and multinational firms. 
The change will impact state entities like the central bank, which would communicate details about the new working hours to commercial banks, said al-Awar, adding that UAE stock exchanges would also be more integrated with global markets. 
“This change will enhance the integration of the banking sector in the UAE with the banking community internationally... it will eliminate the gap that existed in the past,” he said. 
Mohammed Ali Yasin, chief strategy officer at Al Dhabi Capital, said the financial sector would benefit from being able to make simultaneous payment settlements with developed markets and the tourism industry would also be a beneficiary. 
“It could be a good experiment for other countries in the region,” he said. 
Friday is a weekly holiday in the other five Gulf Arab states and many predominantly Muslim countries.

2,Billionaires’ share of global wealth soars during pandemic,Report calls for a “modest progressive wealth tax on global multimillionaires” in order to redistribute wealth.,"PARIS: The share of global wealth of the world’s richest people soared at a record pace during the Covid pandemic, a report on inequality showed on Tuesday.
Since 1995, the slice held by billionaires has risen from one percent to three percent, according to the World Inequality Report.
“This increase was exacerbated during the Covid pandemic. In fact, 2020 marked the steepest increase in global billionaires’ share of wealth on record,” the document said.
The club of the richest one percent has taken more than a third of all additional wealth accumulated since 1995, while the bottom 50 percent captured just two percent.
“After more than 18 months of Covid-19, the world is even more polarised,” Lucas Chancel, co-director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics, said.
“While the wealth of billionaires rose by more than 3.6 trillion euros ($4 trillion), 100 million more people joined the ranks of extreme poverty,” said Chancel, noting that extreme poverty had been previously falling for 25 years.
A real-time ranking by Forbes magazine shows that the top 10 richest people each have a net worth exceeding $100 billion, with Tesla boss Elon Musk on top with around $265 billion.
Only one of the men is not American — LVMH luxury group chief Bernard Arnault — and all but two are tech industry leaders whose fortunes have been turbocharged by soaring company share prices.
According to the report, the world’s 52 richest individuals have seen the value of their wealth grow by 9.2 percent per year for the past 25 years, well above less wealthy social groups.
Women’s share of total global income from work was less than 35 percent, up from near 30 percent in 1990 but short of parity with men.
Europe was the world’s most equal region, with the richest 10 percent taking 36 percent of the income share, whereas the Middle East and North Africa was the most unequal as the wealthiest 10 percent of society took 58 percent of income.
Chancel, the study’s lead author, said state intervention was crucial in the fight against poverty but that wealthier nations were able to act more during the coronavirus pandemic.
Rich countries introduced measures such as furlough and increased social security payments during the crisis to prop up income levels and save jobs, which states with fewer resources did not replicate.
The 228-page report, whose contributors include French economist Thomas Piketty, calls for a  “modest progressive wealth tax on global multimillionaires” in order to redistribute wealth, along with measures to prevent tax evasion.
“Given the large volume of wealth concentration, modest progressive taxes can generate significant revenues for governments,” the report said.
It added that today’s taxes excessively target property and should instead include all forms of wealth, particularly financial assets, which make up the core of modern fortunes.
The authors also recommended the creation of an international financial register to allow authorities to monitor taxpayers’ assets and capital income and reduce tax evasion.

3,UN court tells Armenia and Azerbaijan to cool feud,"Azerbaijan told to protect Armenian prisoners from 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, stop desecration of Armenian cultural heritage","THE HAGUE: The UN’s top court ordered rivals Armenia and Azerbaijan on Tuesday to prevent racial hatred and avoid aggravating their feud following last year’s war between the Caucasus arch-foes.
Azerbaijan was also told to protect Armenian prisoners from the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and to stop the desecration of Armenian cultural heritage, including churches.
The former Soviet republics had both made tit-for-tat requests asking the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague to take emergency measures against alleged breaches of a treaty banning racial discrimination.
“Both parties shall refrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the court or make it more difficult to resolve,” ICJ chief judge Joan Donoghue said.
The court’s orders — which are binding even though the ICJ has no real means of enforcing them — are pending a full case on the row that could take years to resolve.
The ICJ was set up after World War II to resolve disputes between United Nations member states. Tensions have simmered for years over Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian region of Azerbaijan that broke away from Baku’s control in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Conflict erupted in autumn last year, claiming more than 6,500 lives. It ended in November with a Russian-brokered ceasefire under which Armenia ceded territories it had controlled for decades to Turkish-backed Azerbaijan. Judges on Tuesday ordered Azerbaijan to  “protect from violence and bodily harm” all Armenian prisoners from the conflict and ensure they are treated lawfully, following allegations of mistreatment. Azerbaijan must further prevent the  “vandalism and desecration” of Armenian cultural heritage including churches, it said.
Baku had already ordered the removal of wax mannequins of Armenian troops from Azerbaijan’s so-called Military Trophies Park, which Armenia had requested due to their  “Armenophobic features”, the court said.

4,Afghan currency slides on bank collapse fears,Afghanistan has been hit by an enormous shortage of dollars since the Taliban marched into Kabul and seized power on August 15.,"KABUL: Afghanistan’s currency hit 100 to the US dollar on Tuesday, losing five percent of its value in one day in a panic triggered by fears that one of the country’s biggest banks could collapse, traders said.
Afghanistan has been hit by an enormous shortage of dollars since the Taliban marched into Kabul and seized power on August 15, as international donors suspended billions in aid provided annually to the previous regime.
Since the Taliban takeover, the US has frozen around 10 billion dollars in reserves that Afghanistan’s central bank had parked in the US Federal Reserve.
The crisis looked set to deepen overnight and this morning when news circulated that Maiwand Bank — among the country’s five biggest lenders, according to traders — had collapsed.
“That was false,” said Haji Sher Shah Ahmadzai, who heads the dispute resolution committee at Kabul’s Money Exchange Commission.
But  “trust has been eroded,” he said, as Maiwand has in recent weeks failed to return funds owed to the commission, which has some eight million dollars deposited in the bank, Ahmadzai said.
A spokesman for Maiwand said that the bank remained operational and was continuing to honour commitments to depositors in line with central bank directives.
One financially insolvent trader among the hundreds at Kabul’s open air exchange held his head in his hands, repeatedly crying out:  “I have drowned!” The Afghani stood at 104.5 to the greenback in late Tuesday trade, compared to around 80 in early August.
One trader said that the market is being hit by fears of a much wider collapse of the country’s financial system.
“There are rumours about the collapse of all Afghanistan’s banks,” said Bilal Khan as he counted batches of Afghanis.
“There is no money in the banks. The banks are refusing to pay your own money to you.” Khan also cited a dawning realisation in the market that the Taliban will not be recognised by the international community any time soon. Traders had initially expected that  “the new government would be recognised,” he said.

Discussing Malala Yousafzai’s inclusion in the list, a BBC article said: “The youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate… is a Pakistani girls’ education activist and UN messenger of peace. She has spoken up for the right of young women to an education since she was 11. 
“Her activism began with blogs for the BBC about living under Taliban rule in Pakistan and the ban on girls attending school. In October 2012, a gunman boarded her bus, looking for her, and shot her in the head.
“Following her recovery, she has continued her work as co-founder of the non-profit Malala Fund, aiming to build a world where every girl can learn and lead without fear.”

6,France arrests suspected member of  Khashoggi murder squad,Khalid Alotaibi was detained by border police on basis of an arrest warrant issued by Turkey as he was about to board a flight.,"PARIS: French police on Tuesday arrested a suspected member of the hit squad that murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul and who is wanted by Turkey to face justice over the killing.
Khalid Alotaibi, 33, was detained by border police on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by Turkey as he was about to board a flight to Riyadh from Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, judicial and airport sources said. He is due to appear before prosecutors on Wednesday.
He is one of 26 Saudis charged in absentia by Turkey over the killing in a trial that got underway in October 2020. If convicted, he could face life imprisonment.
Two of the 26 being tried in absentia in Turkey are former aides to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. No Saudi official has ever faced justice in person in Turkey for the killing.
Alotaibi is also one of 17 people that the US Treasury designated for sanctions in 2018 over their role in the murder.
He has the right to fight extradition to Turkey. If he does, the French judiciary must decide whether to keep him in detention pending a formal Turkish extradition request, or to free him on condition that he does not leave France.
It can typically take several weeks for a court to rule on whether to hand him over to Turkey against his will.
In September 2020, a Saudi court overturned five death sentences issued after a closed-door trial in Saudi Arabia, sentencing the accused to 20 years in prison instead.

7,"US will ‘pay the price’ for Olympics diplomatic boycott, warns Beijing",Washington’s move was broadly welcomed by rights groups and politicians in the US.,"BEIJING: China warned on Tuesday the United States would  “pay the price” for a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics over human rights concerns.
The US move — which stopped short of preventing athletes from attending — comes after Washington spent months wrangling over what position to take on the Games, beginning in February next year, over what it has termed China’s  “genocide” of the Uyghur minority.
The move drew fiery opposition from Beijing, which threatened unspecified countermeasures, warning the US would  “pay the price for its wrongdoing”.
“Stay tuned,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters at a daily press briefing.
“The US attempt to interfere with the Beijing Winter Olympics out of ideological prejudice, based on lies and rumours, will only expose (its) sinister intentions,” Zhao said.
“The Winter Olympics are not a stage for political shows and political manipulation,” he added, accusing the US of  “actions that interfere in and undermine the Beijing Winter Olympics.” But Washington’s move was broadly welcomed by rights groups and politicians in the US, where President Joe Biden has been under pressure to speak out against Chinese rights abuses.
White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the administration would send no diplomatic or official representation to the Games given China’s  “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity in Xinjiang and other human rights abuses.” Sending official representation would signal that the Games were  “business as usual,” Psaki said.  “And we simply can’t do that.”  “The athletes on Team USA have our full support. We will be behind them 100 percent as we cheer them on from home,” she added.
The International Olympic Committee called it a  “purely political decision for each government, which the IOC in its political neutrality fully respects.” The announcement  “also makes it clear that the Olympic Games and the participation of the athletes are beyond politics and we welcome this,” an IOC spokesperson said.
Russia — whose predecessor state the USSR was subject to a full boycott of the Olympics by the United States in 1980 following its invasion of Afghanistan — slammed the decision.
“Our position is that the Olympic Games should be free of politics,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, but said it was positive that participants were not impacted by the decision.
US-China relations hit a low point under Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump, with a massive trade war and incendiary debate over how the Covid-19 virus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Biden has sought to re-engage with Beijing while at the same time focused on strengthening traditional US alliances to counter China’s growing economic clout and military presence across the Indo-Pacific region.
His administration has left Trump-era trade tariffs on China in place and continues to order naval patrols through sensitive international sea lanes that Beijing is accused of trying to bring under its control.
But with Biden also emphasising the need for dialogue, critics on the right say he is being too soft, making the looming Olympic Games a political flashpoint.
Members of Team USA, their coaches, trainers and other staff will still receive consular and diplomatic security assistance, State Department spokesman Ned Price said.
Campaigners say that at least one million Uyghurs and other Turkic-speaking, mostly Muslim minorities have been incarcerated in camps in Xinjiang, where China is also accused of forcibly sterilising women and imposing forced labour. Bob Menendez, chair of the powerful US Senate foreign relations committee, welcomed the diplomatic boycott as  “a powerful rebuke” of the  “genocide in Xinjiang.” Human Rights Watch called the Biden administration’s decision  “crucial” but urged more accountability  “for those responsible for these crimes and justice for the survivors.” 
The Beijing Olympics have also been overshadowed by sexual assault accusations made by former tennis star Peng Shuai against a retired top Communist Party politician. The three-time Olympian was not heard from for nearly three weeks before re-emerging, after her claims were rapidly censored.
Coming just six months after the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Summer Games, the Winter Olympics will be held from February 4 to 20 in a  “closed loop” bubble because of Covid-19 restrictions
On the streets of Beijing, residents said that they didn’t agree with the US move.
“Sports is sports. How is it connected to politics? Besides, should political standards be set by the US? Does whatever standard you say become the de facto standard?” said a 72-year-old retired teacher, who gave her surname as Wang.
