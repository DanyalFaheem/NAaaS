• Certificate of appreciation awarded to person who tried to save Priyantha
• Business community pledges $100,000 for heirs    
ISLAMABAD: While condemning lynching of Sri Lankan national Priyantha Kumara in Sialkot, Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed that no one will be allowed to kill anyone in the name of religion and stern action will be taken against those who resort to violence in the name of Islam or the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him). 
“I will not allow such incidents to happen as long as I am alive,” asserted Mr Khan while addressing the condolence reference held at PM Office for the Sri Lankan national who was lynched by a mob last Friday. 
Members of the federal cabinet also attended the event, which was held to express solidarity with the victim’s family and the people and government of Sri Lanka.  
The premier laid a wreath on a portrait of the late Kumara. On the occasion, he said the business community in Sialkot had collected $100,000 for the victim’s family and that they would continue to receive his monthly salary. 
Lamenting the cruelty in the name of Islam, Mr Khan said people attacked others in the name of religion despite the fact that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) preached peace [...], kindness and justice.  
“Justice is meted out in a humane society, but there is no rule of law in a society of animals,” he remarked. 
Referring to deterioration of social values, he said society had reached a point where if someone was accused of blasphemy, the victim rotted in jail, as everyone seemed reluctant to investigate what had actually transpired. “Everyone is afraid of it. In fact lawyers do not come forward and judges also refuse to hear the cases,” Mr Khan noted. 
In this situation, the PM said it was heartening to see that a person, Malik Adnan, tried to save his colleague by risking his own life. “I am sure our youth will remember the way Malik Adnan stood up against those beasts,” he added. 
On the occasion, a certificate of appreciation from the government was awarded to Mr Adnan. Earlier on Sunday, the PM had taking notice of his struggle to defend his colleague lauded the “moral courage and bravery” and announced that he would be honoured with the Tamgha-i-Shujaat.  
Hailing his gallantry efforts, the prime minister said: “It was painful to see what the mob did [to Kumara], but seeing Adnan restored our faith in humanity.” He said Tamgha-i-Shujaat would be awarded to Mr Adnan on Pakistan Day. 
Prime Minister Khan also recalled the December 2014 attack on the Army Public School, Peshawar, and said the horrific incident had united the nation that resolved to end terrorism. Similarly, he added, “after the Sialkot incident, the whole nation has decided that we will not let such a thing happen again.”  
He urged the nation to read more and more about the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). “Our country is the only one that was built in the name of Islam, but the Sialkot incident has brought us embarrassment,” he said, adding that he received many messages from those living abroad. 
Mr Khan also noted that Indian media highlighted the Sialkot tragedy with an aim to defame Pakistan. “Their TV programmes portrayed the incident as a routine occurrence in Pakistan, which is unjust,” he observed. 
A short documentary promoting interfaith harmony was also screened at the event.

1,FBR puts off new property valuations till Jan 16,"Realty stakeholders highlight anomalies, aberrations in the notified valuation tables.","ISLAMABAD: To bring an end to the ongoing controversy over the decision to increase valuation rates for property, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Tuesday held in abeyance the new valuations for taxation until January 16 next year in the wake of an extraordinary rise in property rates and complaints from realty stakeholders.  
The FBR had on December 1 revised upwards the property valuations for the purpose of taxation in 40 major cities of the country to bring them on a par with market rates. The rates were revised in order to charge actual income tax on property transactions.  
An official announcement said all chief commissioners inland revenue (CCIRs) would constitute valuation review committees (VRCs) and notify them by December 10. Any stakeholder having any reservations over the valuations may lodge a representation before the VRC by Dec 15.  
The CCIRs will undertake meaningful consultative processes with the stakeholders and engage the SBP-approved valuers for determination of values, which could be either more or less than the lately notified valuations.  

Realty stakeholders highlight anomalies, aberrations in the notified valuation tables 

The FBR has already announced engaging top property valuation experts of the State Bank of Pakistan who will hold meaningful consultations with the key stakeholders, including real estate agents and town developers. This consultative process will review such cases individually and thereby make necessary recommendations to remove distortions if any and bring property value near market price.  
Until this process is completed, the application of new valuation rates will be suspended till mid-January 2022. The FBR received complaints from across the country from various stakeholders, including real estate agents and town developers, about an extraordinary rise in property rates resulting from the recently notified property valuation.  
To begin with, the FBR issued detailed instructions through an office memorandum on the procedure to be adopted to review the anomalies in the property rates and rationalise the same. Accordingly, it has been decided to review and revisit the notified valuation tables wherever overvaluation or undervaluation is pointed out by a stakeholder.  
It is pertinent to mention that the FBR is empowered to determine fair market value of immovable properties in terms of Section 68(4) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001. Therefore, the FBR vide SRO No.1534-1572(I)/2021 issued new valuation tables of properties across 40 major cities with a view to bringing them closer to the actual market prices.  
However, the FBR received certain objections from various stakeholders, including real estate agents and housing societies, highlighting anomalies and aberrations in the newly notified valuation tables. Although the notified valuations have been arrived at by the FBR Field Formations through a rigorous consultative process and wherefore have largely been well received, yet the possibility of error cannot be ruled out, and the same cannot be taken as carved in stone.  
The VRCs will take a decision on the representations by January 10, 2022, and forward the same to the FBR for notification. All recommendations made by the VRCs on revaluations will be re-notified on January 15, 2022, which will come into force on January 16.  
In the meantime, SRO1534-1572(I)/2021 is held in abeyance to allow registration of in-process transactions, said the announcement.

2,SJC accused of acting under intelligence agency’s influence,"ISLAMABAD: Senior lawyer Hamid Khan, representing the outspoken former judge of the Islamabad High Court Shaukat ...","ISLAMABAD: Senior lawyer Hamid Khan, representing the outspoken former judge of the Islamabad High Court Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, on Tuesday accu­sed the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), which had recommended removal of the judge from the office, of acting under the influence of the country’s key intelligence agency.
The assertion did not go down well with the five-judge Supreme Court bench that had taken up Mr Siddiqui’s appeal against the opinion of the SJC and the Oct 11, 2018 notification under which he was removed as superior court judge for his July 21, 2018 speech at the District Bar Association, Rawalpindi. 
In the speech he had made remarks about involvement of certain officers of the executive organ of the State, specifically the Inter-Services Intelligence, in judicial affairs to allegedly manipulate formation of the benches of the high court.  
“I am deeply grieved by such sweeping remarks,” Justice Umar Ata Bandial, who headed the bench, said and told Mr Khan that he was a senior lawyer but when he started hitting boundaries it became unbearable.  
“Don’t hurl abuses like this,” Justice Bandial said. “One can criticise judgments of this court to their heart’s delight but don’t go beyond it and start criticising the people and the judges who are voiceless and cannot defend themselves.  
“We do not even have a PRO (public relations officer) to stand for us,” Justice Bandial observed, reminding the counsel that he (the judge) was also a member of the five-judge SJC. But Mr Khan retorted that he was mentioning the old SJC of which Justice Bandial was not the member.   
The former judge was not present in the courtroom No. 2.  
“The petitioner has swept us all across the board,” Justice Bandial regretted adding the former judge had maligned his own institution.  
Referring to the order the former judge had issued after hearing the case about the Nov 2017 four-week long sit-in by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), Justice Bandial regretted that the former judge had started fresh proceedings on suo motu with observations against the armed forces, when he was supposed to issue notices to them and bring to the notice of the chief justice of his high court or the then chief justice of Pakistan if some information had come to his attention since they were the only competent authorities to initiate any action on such matters.  
“As judges we have to abide by certain discipline but the speech made by the former judge goes beyond that discipline,” Justice Bandial observed.  
Hamid Khan however tried to establish that his client had been facing a number of complaints but things had been going at a snail’s pace. He recalled that the reference filed in 2015 for excessive renovation of Mr Siddiqui’s official residence was adjourned sine die on July 31, 2018 but another show cause notice was issued the same evening 10 days after he made the speech at the Rawalpindi bar. Earlier in Nov 27, 2018, the former judge faced another reference on the complaints of former MNA Jamshed Dasti and Ms Kalsoom for bringing the institution of the army into disrepute for his order issued in the TLP dharna case.  
In the dharna case order the former judge had referred to an agreement reached between an army official and the TLP, which had blocked the Faizabad junction, and had regretted that armed forces had no business bringing a compromise over the TLP dharna and that the agreement bore the signatures of the then director general counter terrorism Maj Gen Faiz Hameed and by doing so the top leadership of the armed forces went beyond its constitutional domain thus putting the dignity of the army at stake.  
That was the critical order after which all hell broke loose against his client, the counsel argued, adding it was after these observations in the dharna case judgement that things started moving fast and show cause notices started coming from the SJC one after another. The counsel tried to establish that it was done under the influence of the ISI.  
He emphasised that making speeches at public forums did not constitute misconduct and recalled that the incumbent chief justice of Pakistan recently made a speech at a public forum and that former judge M.R. Kiani used to criticise martial law at public forums.  
Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan said the judges had to follow certain parameters and their speeches should concern issues related to the bench and the bar or jurisprudential issues. “But speeches criticising the government or different institutions go out of the way.”  
Had there been an inquiry by the SJC, the scope of the speech could have been determined, Mr Khan argued. But Justice Ahsan wondered whether it was the job of the judge to go to public forums and make speeches against his own institution.  
“There are certain parameters like a judge cannot question foreign policy or demand sacking of foreign minister or foreign secretary or discuss CTBT or suggest that the country’s nuclear policy should be scrapped,” Justice Ahsan observed adding the SJC acted against the former judge since he chose to take his point of view to the public forum.  
Justice Sardar Tariq Masood reminded the counsel that Justice Kiani never maligned his own institution, highlighting that the court had to define the real meaning of the inquiry.   
Justice Masood wondered why the former judge who questioned the action of Faiz Hameed in the dharna case order later met the same officer at his house on three occasions.  
The counsel argued that he was making a case of mala fide since the SJC did not conduct any inquiry.   
He said the court’s judgment on the matter would lay down precedence for future of the judiciary since any military regime in future could throw out any judge on flimsy grounds without any inquiry by the SJC even for having a quarrel with his wife by issuing a simple show cause notice.  
Justice Bandial however emphasised that Mr Siddiqui was removed on a reference as the SJC took suo motu notice and since the speech was undisputed there was no need of conducting an inquiry.   
The case will be taken again next week.

3,Public Accounts Committee accepts NAB chief’s request for in-camera session,Committee chairman assures NAB chief of help in settling an audit objection of Rs3.6 billion lapse of funds.,"ISLAMABAD: Chairman of the National Accounta­bility Bureau retired justice Javed Iqbal finally appeared before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the parliament on Tuesday and requested it to convene an in-camera meeting to review the performance of his organisation. 
While the NAB chairman had been avoiding successive meetings despite repeated summons, the committee members hailed his decision to appear before the accountability panel. 
Contrary to the routine practice of aggressively grilling the principal accounting officers (PAOs) of ministries/divisions, the committee members put friendly questions and the auditors raised fewer objections in the audit report of NAB as compared to different ministries. 
PAC chairman Rana Tanveer Hussain also assured the NAB chairman of the committee’s help in settling an audit objection of Rs3.6 billion lapse of funds, which was not in the committee’s domain. He said the committee would write a letter to the National Assembly for settlement of the audit para. 
However, when he expressed dissatisfaction over the report submitted by the NAB about recoveries, Justice Iqbal requested the PAC for holding an in-camera session so that he could satisfy all the members. 
Subsequently, the PAC decided to convene the in-camera meeting in the first week of January. 
While talking to the media later, Justice Iqbal said he continued to hold the office as per law after his tenure as President Arif Alvi had promulgated the ordinance regarding his extension till the appointment of new chairman. 
Asked about bureau’s inaction on the issues of wheat and sugar crisis, NAB chairman said that those issues were being dealt by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). 
Former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who appeared before an accountability court in LNG-terminal reference, meanwhile, criticised the NAB and the government for being lenient with sugar and wheat mafia. 
However, retired Justice Iqbal in response to another question said only those in the opposition who were facing references for their wrongdoings were criticising the bureau. 
The ex-premier in his interaction with journalists also criticised the delay in appointment of new chairman of the accountability watchdog. He said the summary for the appointment had been forwarded to President Alvi, but the latter appeared to be too busy in materializing contracts with foreign dentists. 
He said the economy was at the verge of collapse and the opposition members had the options to resign from assemblies en masse and tabling a no-trust motion to topple the government.

4,"ECP, opposition need to understand EVMs: govt",ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Tuesday said the government...,"• Committee formed to strengthen PAC
• Cabinet condemns lynching incident
• Ration programme to be started for those earning below Rs31,000    
ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Tuesday said the government wanted the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and the opposition to first understand the working of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) and then criticise it. 
“The ECP and anyone else first need to understand what the [EVMs] system is and avoid criticising it without having any knowledge about it,” Mr Chaudhry said at a post-cabinet meeting press conference. 
The meeting, which was presided over by Prime Minister Imran Khan, formed a high-powered committee to strengthen the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). 
The committee is presently headed by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Rana Tanvir. 
“If they [ECP and the opposition] criticise the EVM system without understanding it, we will have objections then,” the information minister said. 
He said the government wanted to give time to the Election Commission for its satisfaction over the use of EVMs [in the next general elections in 2023]. 
“But it should not be that long; the process, which started in 2012, has still not concluded,” he added. 
The minister said an awareness campaign on EVMs would be launched to make people understand its benefits, adding that the ECP had already given 27 recommendations for EVMs and should therefore issue tenders to manufacture the voting machines under the same conditions and ask manufacturers to do the same. 
Mr Chaudhry said the objective of introducing EVMs was to make the election process free and fair, adding that the PTI had promised in its election manifesto to give overseas Pakistanis the right to vote. 
About the recent legislation that bestowed voting rights to expats, the minister said the opposition was committing ‘political suicide’ by participating in a campaign launched by some elements against provision of voting rights to overseas Pakistanis. 
“It appears as if only the PTI [Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf] is responsible for the welfare of overseas Pakistanis, but the fact is that the entire diaspora is not associated with the party,” Mr Chaudhry said. 
It was beyond the minister’s comprehension that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and PML-N were taking part in a campaign launched to deny right of vote to 10 million expats whose families were living in Pakistan. 
He said almost the entire family of the PML-N supremo, Nawaz Sharif, was abroad and his two sons – Hassan and Husain Nawaz – might have even torn their Pakistani passports, but still they would get the opportunity to vote for their father’s party if voting rights were given to expats. 
Mr Chaudhry said Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s objection on the use of EVMs in the elections was also beyond understanding as he had lived abroad for many years. 
PAC strengthening
The minister said PTI members in the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) met the prime minister recently and it was decided that all institutions would be strengthened to bring transparency in governance. 
He said the committee had been constituted comprising Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Tarin, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Poverty Alleviation Dr Sania Nishtar and PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar to suggest steps for strengthening the PAC. 
Food inflation
Mr Chaudhry said the cabinet was given a comparative study of the prices of essential commodities and it transpired that during the past two weeks Sensitive Price Index (SPI) had shown a downward trend. 
From January, he said a ration programme would be started under which 30pc subsidy would be given to those earning less than Rs31,000 per month. 
He said those benefiting from this scheme would get flour at a price even less than the cost in 2018. 
The information minister appreciated the Sindh government for taking some steps to control prices of daily-use items in Karachi and Hyderabad. 
“Now a bag of 20kg wheat flour is being sold at Rs1,456 in Karachi and at Rs1,316 in Hyderabad whereas it was available for Rs1,100 in the rest of the country,” he added. 
The minister said per kilogram sugar was available for Rs90 across the country except Karachi and Islamabad where the commodity was being sold at Rs97 per kg. 
A reduction of up to Rs4 per kg in the price of sugar was also expected in the coming days, he claimed, adding that vegetable oil was available for Rs399 per kg across the country. 
He said it was ridiculous to criticise the government on drawing comparison of inflation in Pakistan with regional countries. 
“We are not drawing comparison of the country with France and UK; it is being compared with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India,” he added. 
Except tea, Mr Chaudhry said, every commodity including wheat flour, lentils, sugar, onion, tomato, chicken, eggs, fresh milk and even petrol was cheaper in Pakistan as compared to other regional countries. 
He agreed that there had been inflation in the country for the salaried class, “but there is a need to adjust with the situation”. 
There has been an additional income of Rs400 billion in the agriculture sector this year, he said, adding that the comparison could be done in contemporary times instead of the past. 
Cabinet condemns lynching
Fawad Chaudhry said the cabinet strongly condemned the lynching of a Sri Lankan manager by a mob in Sialkot, adding that it was against Islamic teachings and was tantamount to distorting the image of Pakistan. 
The prime minister and the cabinet directed the Punjab government to start the trial of the arrested accused as soon as possible and take steps to punish them, Mr Chaudhry said, adding that “the way Pakistan’s society and government have reacted to this tragedy shows that we are very different from India and some other countries”. 
He said in India, such incidents against Muslims occurred on a daily basis but its government was reluctant to take any action against the culprits. 
“The whole nation was united on the Sialkot incident just like it was at the time of the APS tragedy and every citizen was condemning this act,” he added. 
In a separate decision, the federal cabinet refused to meet the family of a missing journalist, Mudassar Mehmood, and decided to file an appeal against the Islamabad High Court’s Dec 1 decision, which stated that the prime minister and cabinet members were responsible for the recovery of missing persons. The journalist went missing on Aug, 19, 2018.
