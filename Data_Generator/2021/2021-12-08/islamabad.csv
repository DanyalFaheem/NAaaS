Final notices issued to schools, colleges to shift out of residential areas, says official  
Protesters ask cantonment authorities to provide them alternative place

RAWALPINDI: Private school and college owners along with hundreds of teachers and students on Tuesday staged a protest rally from Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) to Chaklala Cantonment Board (CCB) after they were served with notices to vacate residential areas by December 31.
The RCB has issued notices to 495 private schools and colleges to shift out from residential areas under the directives of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, an official said.
The protesters demanded that the eviction of private educational institutions from residential areas should be stopped until the cantonment administration provides them an alternative place to operate.
When contacted, RCB spokesman Qaiser Mehmood told Dawn that final notices had been issued to 495 private schools and colleges to shift out of residential areas otherwise strict action would be taken against them, including sealing of their buildings.
He said the RCB had also displayed banners at prominent places in the cantonment for the information of the public, parents, principals and owners of the educational institutions.
The institutions were earlier issued several notices to shift from the residential buildings by December-end so that the academic year of the students could be saved, he added.
In 2018, the cantonment boards had declared private schools and colleges in residential areas illegal and issued notices to the owners.
On Tuesday, the Joint Action Committee of All-Pakistan Private Schools and Colleges Association along with teachers, students and parents held the rally and later staged a protest in front of the RCB offices.
Former MNA and PML-N Divisional President Malik Abrar Ahmed, leader of the Joint Action Committee Chaudhry Mohammad Tayyab and Malik Azhar Mahmood, Nasir Mahmood and Abrar Ahmad Khan were also present.
The protesters were carrying placards and chanting slogans in favour of their demands. They urged the chief justice of Pakistan, the prime minister and the army chief to stop the eviction of private educational institutions from the cantonment areas.
Malik Abrar Ahmed announced his support for the protesters, including students and teachers. 
He said the private schools and colleges served people and provided better education on reasonable fees.
Chaudhry Tayyab said middle class parents will face problems to enroll their children in schools located away from their homes if the schools were shifted out of residential areas.
He said the closure of street schools will also leave thousands of teachers unemployed.
Others speakers said educational institutions operating in the cantonments were fulfilling all the legal requirements.
They said in all the 42 cantonment boards, private educational institutions provided revenue to the cantonment managements.
The cantonment administration should provide an alternative place for the private educational institutions, they added.
They also said due to the closure of such a large number of educational institutions, the door of education would be closed on 3.7 million students.

Besides the chief justice of Pakistan, the JCP comprises the senior most judges of the Supreme Court, chief justice and senior most judge of the Islamabad High Court, law minister, attorney general, members of the Pakistan Bar Council and Islamabad Bar Council.
The JCP held a meeting in the Supreme Court building.
Last year, the JCP had recommended both the judges for appointment as additional judges of the IHC for a period of one year. The parliamentary committee then gave a nod to the JCP’s recommendations.
Sources said the JCP now unanimously decided that the services of both the judges be confirmed as permanent judges of the IHC.
Mr Sattar has studied Master of Law (LLM) at the Harvard School of Law. He is also a writer, columnist and analyst.

3,Senate body forms committee to submit report on schools’ closure,Protesting teachers say strike to continue till decision to place schools under local govt withdrawn,"ISLAMABAD: Expressing concerns over the closure of public schools in Islamabad, the Senate Standing Committee on Federal Education on Tuesday formed a committee to submit a report within 15 days.
On the other hand, the protesting teachers continued boycotting classes for the last over a week.
Around 200,000 students, who already faced educational loss during the Covid-19 pandemic, are sitting at home as teaching and non-teaching staff under the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) are on a strike against the federal government’s decision of placing the schools under the local government.
The Senate standing committee headed by Senator Irfan Siddiqui took up the issue at a meeting and after hearing the view points of the protesting teachers formed the committee headed by Parliamentary Secretary Education Wajiha Akram.
The committee, however, urged the protesting teachers to call off the strike.
But the teaching and non-teaching staff decided to continue the strike until the government revokes section 166 of the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Ordinance 2021.

Protesting teachers say strike to continue till decision to place schools under local govt withdrawn

The teachers are of the view that placing the FDE and its schools under the local government would be an injustice with the education sector as the local government has no capacity to deal with the sector which requires around Rs20 billion budget annually.
Last week, the teachers staged a massive protest outside Parliament House. The protesters expressed the fear that in future the local government could privatise the education sector besides charging tuition fee. Currently, education is free in all schools while the government also provides free textbooks to the students.
Senator Irfan Siddiqui urged representatives of the Federal Government Education Joint Action Committee to take into consideration the future of the students affected by the strike and resume duties.
The representatives of the action committee informed the committee that the issue had arisen in the wake of the promulgation of the ordinance which under its section 166 envisaged placing educational institutions under the Municipal Corporation of Islamabad (MCI).
They expressed concerns over the ambiguity in their pays and promotion as well as the possible revocation of their status of federal government employees. They said better policies were needed to promote education in the country which was not possible under an administrative unit.
They also expressed concerns regarding funding, which according to them, had always been an issue in the MCI.
Senator Siddiqui remarked that apparently there was absolutely no urgency or emergency to promulgate an ordinance and create chaos. He said hundreds of students, already enduring loss of study time due to the Covid-19 restrictions, continued to suffer due to the teachers’ strike that entered its 9th day.
Members of the committee, despite being divided over the pros and cons of the matter, agreed that a committee should be formulated to review the matter in detail and address the issues of the stakeholders.
Senator Ejaz Ahmed Chaudhry, Senator Fawzia Arshad and Senator Mehr Taj Roghani said despite being a step in the positive direction all-out efforts must be made to address the teachers’ concerns. 
Senator Rukhsana Zuberi said this was a negative measure which will seriously hit the education system in the capital.
The committee while discussing details of the Single National Curriculum stressed the need for clarity of concepts and ideas. The need to review textbook content and ensure removal of typographical errors was emphasised. Inclusion of alternative institutions of learning such as madressahs was also stressed.
The committee showed concerns regarding credentials of authors and their selection criteria. The head of the committee said the matter must be discussed in more detail in the next meeting.
It was recommended that Rafiq Tahir, who headed the National Curriculum Council previously, be invited to the next meeting for more clarity on the subject.

The exhibition was jointly organised by the Rawalpindi Arts Council (RAC) and Development Communications Network (Devcom-Pakistan) in connection with the ongoing 11thedition of Pakistan Mountain Festival (PMF).
Two MPAs from the Punjab Assembly Seemabia Tahir and Shamim Aftab and Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) Chairperson Rina Saeed Khan were the chief guests.
More than 50 paintings by students of different universities and colleges from Rawalpindi and Islamabad were put on display.
Arfaa Ilyas, a student of the Fatima Jinnah Women University (FJWU), who won the first prize painted burning mountains. Haya Aslam, an a-level student from the Westminster Academy also won the first prize; her work portrayed melting icebergs. 
Sara Khan, a student of the National College of Arts (NCA), Rawalpindi won the second prize. Her work portrayed deteriorating mountains in a bubble of water.
Zaneera Ghafoor of the Rawalpindi Women University won the second prize for showing trophies of markhor on rocks. Loss of wildlife due to illegal hunting was depicted in her work.
Other winners included Hadia Aroob from Rawalpindi Women University, Mohsin ur Rehman Baig from NCA, Hifza Naseeb from FJWU and Midhat Fatima from NCA, Rawalpindi while Devcom director’s choice consolation prize went to Zainab Masood, a student of the Westminster Academy, Islamabad.
Climate change has been affecting mountain communities badly and these poor communities have no choice but to bear the brunt, Ms Rina Saeed said, adding Pakistan has made no contribution towards global warming as less than 1 percent of global emissions are from here. Pakistan’s climate action is ahead of global commitments but we need to engage youth for the common good, she said.
Seemabia Tahir said students need to adopt environment-friendly practices while they visit mountains and check their consumption behaviour while educating others to reduce carbon emissions. All can be done with little efforts for larger common gains, she added.
PMF Director Munir Ahmed said young emerging artists participated in the live painting competition organised at FJWU a week back.
RAC’s former director Nahid Manzoor said visual arts could be the best medium to highlight the impact of climate change as we can see the disasters and droughts affecting our lives. 
Waqar Ahmed, director of RAC said the paintings have reflected the vulnerability of our mountains in a creative way.

The residents have held the authorities of the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines (SNGPL) responsible for the situation, claiming they had provided connections to commercial units from the line meant for domestic consumption. Low gas pressure has affected schoolchildren and office goers the most as they have to leave for their respective destinations without breakfast.

Members of the association were speaking at a press conference at the National Press Club. 
PPMA Chairman Mansoor Dilawar, Vice Chairman Atif Iqbal, Chairman PPMA North Dr Faisal Khokhar, former Chairman Asad Shuja were also present at the press conference.
Mansoor Dilawar said though the pharmaceutical products were exempted from sales tax, prices of a number of relevant materials such as bottles, aluminium, impulse glass and utility services such as electricity, gas, etc., were continuously on the rise and government also charged sales tax on them.
“Moreover, the government had imposed sales tax on services of contractors and consultants. Unfortunately, there is also a huge tax on import of machinery and pharmaceutical plants, due to which we have been left with no option but to increase prices of medicines because our profit margins have been squeezed. However, any step to further increase the tax will increase the financial burden on the people,” he said.
He said that according to credible sources, as per agreement of the government with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it has been decided to impose 17pc sales tax on the raw material or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) which are used in the manufacturing of medicines.
“We request the government to reconsider the proposal to increase the taxes in the best interest of the people,” he said.
Usman Shaukat said increase in tax will increase the production cast and ultimately patients and their families will suffer.
“Govt should understand that there is already shortage of a number of medicines just because of narrowing profits on medicines. Government will earn the bad repute in case of imposing 17pc tax,” he said.
He said unfortunately energy cost was continuously increasing due to which government should take steps to provide relief to pharma industry, otherwise medicines will either 
disappear from the market or prices will increase.
While replying to questions, he said that after the appointment of Dr Faisal Sultan as Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Health, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) has taken a number of positive steps to bring transparency in the system and pending issues were 
being addressed due to regular meetings.
“Moreover, Drap has taken some of the steps due to which we are hoping that the exports of medicines will be increased. We are hopeful that Dr Sultan will personally look into the issue and will address the grievances of the industry,” Usman Shaukat said.

Sources in the CDA said officials from the Punjab government and the CDA held a virtual meeting headed by Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar. Chairman Amer Ali Ahmed and members estate and engineering participated from the CDA side.
The sources said it was decided that the CDA will construct the portion of the road along with an interchange. However, the Punjab government will pay against the work that will be carried out in the jurisdiction of the province.
The portion of the ring road will link MI (Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway) with GT Road near Sangjani where it will also be linked with Islamabad’s Margalla Road where an interchange will be constructed.
Another interchange will likely to be constructed near N-5, Wapda Town.
The construction of Margalla Road is already in progress from Sanjgani to D-12 where it will be linked with Khyaban-i-Iqbal. The sources said work on Margalla Road was in progress and was likely to be completed by the end of July next year.
“Today’s meeting made a good decision of allowing same civic agency to do construction of this small portion of 3.4 km road. Now, after completion of this entire project MI-GT road and Margalla Road will be linked, and this step will provide a speedy road network to people,” said an official of CDA.
Last year, concerned departments of Rawalpindi made several efforts to construct the entire 3.4 km road portion but the CDA did not agree to it saying that the civic agency could not allow any provincial organisation to construct a road in its limit.
In February this year, Prime Minister Imran Khan supported CDA’s point of view and decided that CDA will construct the portion of the road that falls in its limit.
During the meeting, the sources said, it was also decided that Punjab and CDA will acquire land separately in their respective areas but the construction work will be carried out by the CDA.
The CDA officials said 1.6km of the road falls in the limit of Islamabad while 1.8km is located in Punjab.
The CDA wanted the Frontier Work Organisation (FWO), which is already engaged in construction of Margalla Road, could win the contract of the portion of the road for its speedy completion as a part of the Margalla Road project.
