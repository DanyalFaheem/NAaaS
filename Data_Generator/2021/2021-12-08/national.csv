0,Conflict settled through Alternative Dispute Resolution,"The tribal land dispute lingered on since 1976 in Orakzai, claiming four lives","ISLAMABAD: The Orakzai district administration has resolved a 45-year-old dispute over land through Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). 
The dispute over the land in Mulla Pattay near Ghiljo Bazaar, Upper Orakzai, involved A’Khel and Dara Dar Mamazai (DDM) tribes which claimed their ownership of the land. A conflict between the two parties reared its head in 1976 and continued since then. As a result, four people were killed in a clash in January this year. 
Orakzai Deputy Commissioner Dr Asif Rahim told Dawn that in 1976 the elders of the tribes were engaged by the then political agent. Possession of the disputed land was taken over by the political administration and both the parties were refrained from using the land. 
“Later in 1979, an Afghan refugee camp was established on the land with mutual consent of the two tribes during the Afghan war. The land remained under the use of Afghan nationals till 2007,” he said. 

The tribal land dispute lingered on since 1976 in Orakzai, claiming four lives

During militancy in the Orakzai area from 2007 to 2017, all inhabitants along with the Afghan refugees migrated to lower areas, he said. In 2016, internally displaced persons returned to their native areas in Upper Orakzai sub-division and started reconstruction of their damaged houses. 
Dr Rahim said that in December 2020, the A’Khel tribe started construction of cottages on the disputed land and consequently the DDM tribe held a jirga with the A’Khel tribe. Other stakeholder tribes also participated in the jirga and claimed their ownership of the disputed land. 
“This year on January 30, the elders of Mishti, Sheikhan, Rabia Khel and DDM tribes held a jirga near Mulla Pattay and demanded demolition of under-construction cottages by the A’Khel tribe on the disputed area. Next day, officials of the district administration and police also participated in the jirga proceedings. Meanwhile, the youngsters of DDM tribe attacked the cottages and started demolishing the constructed cottages.  
During the clash one person belonging to the A’Khel tribe and three men from the rival tribe were killed, the deputy commissioner said. Members of the DDM tribe started agitation against the government for not taking action against their rivals and demanded registration of an FIR against the elders of A’Khel tribe. They staged a sit-in along with the three bodies outside the district administration headquarters in Baber Mela. After successful negotiations, the bodies were shifted for burial and road was reopened for traffic. 
Mr Rahim said that after extension of ADR (Saliseen) Act and Rules 2020 to the newly merged districts, the dispute was referred to Saliseen Committee (ADR) for an amicable solution after obtaining consents from both the parties. 
“I notified a Saliseen Committee comprising eight members from both sides. The committee started its jirga proceedings and held various sessions of the jirga,” the deputy commissioner said. “Finally, on Dec 7, the Saliseen Committee unanimously announced its decision paving the way for an amicable resolution of the land dispute according to which the A’Khel tribe has presented witnesses testifying its claim on the land on oath. Both the parties have accepted the judgement. Implementation of the decision will be completed in a day or two,” he said. 
The goal of the ADR is to ensure inexpensive and expeditious justice without resorting to formal litigation. 
PPP starts mobilising youth 
The Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) has started mobilising the tribal youth for the coming local government elections. 
PPP secretary general Farhatullah Babar said this in a statement on the eve of formal launch of the campaign of Dr Shershah Afridi for the office of tehsil nazim of Bara in Khyber district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
“Dr Afridi is a young, highly educated and progressive activist whose election as chairman of an important tehsil in Khyber will give a boost to the campaign for uplift of former tribal districts,” Mr Babar said. 
He urged the people of Bara tehsil to come out in large numbers on the polling day and vote for Dr Afridi. 
Mr Babar said the people of tribal districts had long suffered due to ill-advised state policies during the past decades and it was time to heal the wounds on the souls of the tribal people. 
He called for curbing resurgence of militants in tribal districts, de-mining of the areas, rehabilitation of the people affected during various military operations and launch of a massive socio-economic programme for uplift of the areas.

1,"Sacked Intelligence Bureau employees were appointed on merit, argues Aitzaz Ahsan",Says the Supreme Court's Aug 17 judgement heavily relied upon a constitutional misinterpretation.,"ISLAMABAD: The Intelligence Bureau (IB) employees sacked after the Aug 17 Supreme Court judgement were not appointed on political grounds and possessed the prescribed qualifications for the job, Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan said during the hearing on Tuesday of a set of petitions seeking review of the decision which had rendered almost 17,000 people jobless.
Barrister Aitzaz cited a Supreme Court ruling in the 2015 judges pension case, arguing before a five-judge bench that the judgement had laid down that a decision could not have a retrospective effect unless specified in the order. 
The verdict carried a specific directive that the pension already given should not be recovered, but no such benefits should be extended in future to those judges who were removed for taking oath under the Provisional Constitution Order.
On the eve of his retirement, Justice Mushir Alam gave a ruling on Aug 17 this year which declared as illegal and unconstitutional a PPP-era law, the Sacked Employees (Reinstatement) Ordinance Act 2010 (SERA). Hundreds of people were inducted into government organisations or promoted after the law took effect.
Aitzaz Ahsan recalled a 2009 court verdict on a petition by the Sindh High Court Bar Association against the emergency imposed by former president Pervez Musharraf on Nov 3, 2007, pointing out that the verdict had declared the constitution of the Islamabad High Court illegal, but protected its employees by sending them to the surplus pool.
But when Justice Umar Ata Bandial, who headed the larger bench, asked Aitzaz Ahsan whether he was suggesting that these employees be sent to the surplus pool, the latter said such a step was taken only when there were no vacancies. There was no such issue in the present case, he stated. 
Barrister Aitzaz produced the copy of a notification issued by the Establishment Division when these employees were dismissed in February 1997, pointing out that although the services of civilians were terminated, the military personnel were never touched.
The counsel argued that the Aug 17 judgement heavily relied upon a constitutional misinterpretation, adding the court judgements should always “apply prospectively and not retrospectively”. 
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah wanted to know whether the Supreme Court can strike down any legislation done by parliament. Aitzaz Ahsan replied that judicial verdicts always lean towards saving a law or a piece of legislation. To substantiate his argument, he cited a 2010 judgement on an appeal by Dr Mubashir Hassan in the NRO case. Justice Shah wondered what the urgency was behind the reinstatement of so many individuals after a lapse of over 10 years. “In the absence of any war, or disease or any other crisis, what was so special about these employees that they were reinstated after more than 10 years.” 
The judge asked Aitzaz Ahsan to enlighten the court what rights would the reinstated individuals be entitled to and what benefits they would get after working for 10 or 12 years even if their appointments were declared to be illegal. The counsel contended that his clients were appointed during the second term of Benazir Bhutto as prime minister (Oct 1993 to Nov 1996) and were sacked on the last day of the caretaker government in February 1997. 
“They were removed through an executive, and not legislative, order,” Aitzaz Ahsan recalled. “It is disturbing that the executive is allowed to remove employees in such a manner.” 
The counsel contended that the Aug 17 judgement had “legal and foundational defects” and relied upon executive orders or on court verdicts like a 2013 decision in a case of shoulder promotion which endorsed executive actions. “Through the SERA, a wrong was righted,” he argued.
Sardar Latif Khosa appeared before the court on behalf of the State Life Insurance Corporation and the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines.

2,Institutions urged to keep away from politics,Ahsan Iqbal says Nawaz made every effort for strengthening institutions.,"KARACHI: It is unfortunate and dangerous for Pakistan that people blame the establishment for every failure of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government and this may lead to irreparable damage, warns PML-N secretary general Ahsan Iqbal. 
Addressing a press conference at the residence of party’s Sindh president Shah Mohammad Shah on Tuesday, the former interior minister suggested it was time the institutions limited themselves to their professional duties. 
“It is unfortunate that if you take a round of the city and ask a roadside vendor, he will blame the establishment for the failure of Imran Khan and his government,” he claimed when asked about the possibility of neutrality of “umpires” during the recent by-elections. 
“When you mention umpires, it means the establishment. We need to understand the consequences of this attachment of the establishment with any party. It’s dangerous for Pakistan. The establishment is not and should not be attached with any party. We have seen severe consequences of this [in the past]. It’s time that our institutions distance themselves from politics and play their professional role.” 

Ahsan says Nawaz made every effort for strengthening institutions

Mr Iqbal recalled how PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif had made every effort for strengthening institutions and ‘respect for vote’, which ultimately led to awareness among people as well as political parties about their actual mandate and responsibility. He dodged a question about the comments former president Asif Ali Zardari made in Lahore the other day accusing the PML-N of manoeuvring to redesign constituencies in Punjab for political gains. 
“As a member of a political party I should not react to anything that goes against another opposition party,” he said. “I won’t comment on that and expect other opposition parties to also focus on Imran Khan and his government. I would miss every ball bowled by an opposition party and try to hit a six even on a bouncer thrown by Imran Khan.” 
The PML-N leader also vowed to reorganise the party across Sindh and announced that they would contest the next elections in every district of the province. He also recalled the development projects carried out by the PML-N government when it was in power at the Centre.

4,PDM adamant on its Pakistan Day long march protest,Interior minister hints at banning protest in federal capital on eve of March 23.,"ISLAMABAD: Rejecting the government’s criticism of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) decision to hold a long march on the Pakistan Day, the eight-party opposition alliance on Tuesday vowed to reach Islamabad on March 23 and warned the authorities against any attempt to use force to prevent the marchers from entering the federal capital. 
“So far, we have decided to reach Islamabad. The duration of the stay will be decided [by the leadership] after reaching the capital,” PDM spokesman Hafiz Hamdullah said at a news conference after a meeting of the steering committee of the alliance. 
Responding to a question about the venue of their protest march, Mr Hamdullah claimed that millions of people from across the country would participate in the long march against price hike and turn the twin cities into D-Chowk, the place where the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) had staged a 126-day sit-in while in the opposition in 2014. 

Interior minister hints at banning protest in federal capital on eve of March 23

When a reporter pointed out that every year the army took over most parts of the capital ahead of March 23 military parade and, therefore, there could be a possibility of a confrontation, Mr Hamdullah, who is also a senior member of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F), said the government would be responsible for any untoward happening. “We will come. Stop us Asad Umer, if you can,” he said while referring to a statement by the minister for planning and development that the opposition would receive a bashing if it held a long march. 
Earlier in the day, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed at a news conference asked the PDM leadership to review its decision to march on Islamabad on the Pakistan Day. 
The minister suggested to Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif and JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman to change the date of the planned march. 
“Announcing a march on such a date is not in interest of the country as the entire nation along with foreign delegates and overseas Pakistanis come to Islamabad for witnessing the national parade arranged by Pakistan’s armed forces on March 23 every year,” state-run Associated Press of Pakistan quoted the minister as telling the presser. 
Mr Rashid said if the opposition did not change the date, it should not blame the government for not allowing them to hold protest, as Islamabad would be on high alert for the parade with closure of some roads for two to three days in advance for parade rehearsal. He asked Maulana Fazl not to use seminary students to achieve agenda of those “who have already lost popularity among the masses”. 
In an apparent reference to the PML-N senior leadership, the interior minister said they had talent in singing and other activities, but had no interest in public sufferings. 
Justifying the PDM decision, Mr Hamdullah said it was a national and republic day and being part of the nation, they had every right to raise voice against an “imposed and a selected government”. 
“March 23 is a national day. Parade will be held. When it is a national day, then are we separate from the nation? It is a republic day. Millions of people will come [to Islamabad] for democracy,” he declared. 
Mr Hamdullah regretted that there was no democracy, no parliament and no politics in the country. He also said the PDM was making decisions while acting as one political party. 
The JUI-F leader said the steering committee had also decided to hold seminars and conventions on the issue of price hike in all the four provincial capitals and Islamabad and the dates would be announced later. He said the main event would be held in Islamabad where representatives of lawyers, labours, farmers, students, civil society, doctors, businessmen and people from all walks of life would be invited. 
The decision to hold the protest march on March 23 was announced by PDM president Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Monday after presiding over a meeting of the heads of PDM member-parties in Islamabad. Despite repeated questions by reporters, he refused to tell if the protest march would be a one-day event or it could go on for an indefinite period. 
The Maulana said the option of resigning from the assemblies en masse had also been discussed, but its timing would be announced later. 
Another ‘big decision’ taken by the PDM leaders in their much-anticipated meeting was about holding seminars on the issue of price hike, growing poverty and unemployment.

5,JI urges govt to meet demands of Gwadar protesters,"Says people are fed up because government has given them only inflation, unemployment and poverty.","GWADAR: Jamaat-i-Islami emir Sirajul Haq has alleged that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government has written history with its bad governance and incompetence during the past three years and it seems it is still directionless in its bid to fix the country’s economy. 
Speaking at a press conference in Turbat, he said the people from Gwadar to Chitral are now fed up with the government’s performance because it has given them only inflation, unemployment and poverty. 
The JI chief has visited Gwadar to express solidarity with the people taking part in the ongoing protest movement in the port city, Gwadar Ko Huqooq Do Tehreek (Give Rights to Gwadar Movement). He urged the government to meet the demands of the protesters.  
Mr Haq held a meeting with National Party president and Balochistan former chief minister Abdul Malik Baloch. The two leaders discussed the current political situation and other matters of mutual interests. 
Speaking at the press conference, the JI chief said Balochistan is rich with natural resources, but the poverty ratio in the province is high. He said the youth of Balochistan is jobless and the rich agriculture land is barren due to unavailability of water and government support.
