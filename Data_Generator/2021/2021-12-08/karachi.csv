0,"Sindh governor refuses to sign LG bill, returns it to PA for review","Objections include mayoral election via secret ballot, insertion of Section 140-A and abolition of DMCs.","KARACHI: Raising several objections, Sindh Governor Imran Ismail has refused to give his assent to the Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021 and returned it to the Sindh Assembly for reconsideration, it emerged on Tuesday.
The governor himself confirmed the move while appearing on a private news channel on Monday night describing the recently passed bill as a move to make local government a ‘toothless’ system run by a ‘dummy’ mayor.
He categorically said that it was unacceptable and mentioned several ‘flaws’ in the bill, which made it controversial and based on ‘certain agenda’.
“I have returned the bill and asked them [Sindh Assembly] to fix it before the final nod,” said Mr Ismail. “The bill in fact negates the spirit of democracy and it finally brings the local governments under the provincial government with no authority or power and disallowing every source which could generate resources for the LG representatives. How a democratic party or system can allows this model to get in place for the local governments?”

Objections include mayoral election via secret ballot, insertion of Section 140-A and abolition of DMCs

10 major objections
A senior official on Tuesday explained that the governor raised 10 different objections to the bill and also sent his suggestions for every single objection.
“The gist of the Sindh governor’s objections revolves around Article 140-A of the Constitution, which defines the mandate, effectiveness and true model of the LG system in any province of the country,” he said.
“Among 10 key objections, there are four major points which are mentioned by the governor in his communiqué. Among them is objection on the secret balloting for election of mayor / chairmen. The governor believes that it will pave the way for ‘horse-trading’ and bulldoze the whole electoral process,” the official said.
Secondly, he said, the governor was also against a newly inserted section in the LG bill — insertion of Section 140-A (Power of government to amend schedules) — that allowed the provincial government to amend, remove or add any new clause in the bill without the consent of any stakeholders and knowledge of the local government representatives.
Objection to creation of towns
“So this amendment suggests this entire exercise of tabling a bill in the Sindh Assembly is a fake exercise,” the official added.
“What effectiveness this document will carry when it will become law through validation of the provincial assembly that allows the provincial government to do whatever it wants after it comes into effect? This is a kind of attempt to deceive the legislators and the parliamentary process,” the official said while mentioning the governor’s thought on the bill.
“The governor in his objections has also pointed out the elimination of the district municipal corporations and replacing them with the town system, saying that it will create an administrative issue,” he said.
“Another crucial point of the governor was allowing any unelected person to become mayor. The governor has criticised this model that creates space for non-elected persons only on the basis of strong financial position and close connection with the ruling elite,” the official said.
The Sindh governor had also expressed his serious reservations the way the provincial government had taken away all health, educational and vocational institutions from municipal organisations through the LG bill.
A number of hospitals, schools and training centres being run and owned by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) would come under the fold of the Sindh government leaving no space for the local government in overall health and educational development of the city, he added.
What Constitution says
Article 116 of the Constitution deals with the issue and its clauses 3 and 4 say: “When the Governor has returned a Bill to the Provincial Assembly, it shall be reconsidered by the provincial assembly and, if it is again passed, with or without amendment, by the provincial assembly, by the votes of majority of the members of the provincial assembly present and voting, it shall be again presented to the Governor and the Governor shall give his assent within 10 days, failing which such assent shall be deemed to have been given.
“When the Governor has assented or is deemed to have assented to a bill, it shall become law and be called an act of provincial assembly.”
Murad calls on governor
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah called on Governor Ismail at Governor House on Tuesday.
Karachi Administrator Murtaza Wahab, who is also the spokesperson for the Sindh government and CM’s law adviser, was also present in the meeting.
A statement issued from the Governor House said that the two sides discussed matters of mutual interest, including overall law and order situation, development in province and efforts to improve quality of life of the people.
“During the meeting, the two sides also discussed the reservations [of the governor] against the Sindh Commission for Regularisation of Construction Ordinance,” it added.

1,Customs raid on Karachi city market sparks traders’ protest,Traders allege that Customs Intelligence seized goods worth Rs70m with no documentary proof shared by officials on their claims.,"


 
KARACHI: A large number of traders and shopkeepers of Jama Cloth Market staged a violent protest on main M. A. Jinnah Road in the small hours of Tuesday morning against a late-night raid of Customs authorities on one of their markets to seize alleged smuggled goods.
Area police said the Customs Intelligence raided Allahwala Building being used by several traders as their warehouses in the night between Monday and Tuesday.
“As the news of the raid spread, the shopkeepers and labourers reached the scene and blocked the road for vehicular traffic near Khaliq Dina Hall,” said an official.
“Soon they turned violent and started pelting policemen with stones who were there only to keep things under control during the protest.
The police fired shots into the air to disperse the mob and make space for the traffic, which was jammed on main M. A. Jinnah Road with a number of ambulances moving to nearby Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi stuck up among other vehicles.
The traders on the other hand alleged that the Customs Intelligence seized their goods worth Rs70 million with no documentary proof shared by the officials about their claim.
They said they did not have any receipt of the goods seized by the customs and they had no documentary proof to reclaim them even after going through the due process.
“The Customs Intelligence is a government organisation enjoying all powers and authority,” said Mazhar Khan, representatives of Jama Cloth Market. “Then why they raid in nights?”

2,Policeman held for killing boy in ‘fake’ encounter,KARACHI: The performance of Karachi police and their claims came under serious question on Tuesday when it turned ...,"KARACHI: The performance of Karachi police and their claims came under serious question on Tuesday when it turned out that the Monday night’s ‘encounter’ in Orangi Town in which a ‘suspect’ was gunned down was actually a ‘fake’ shootout.
A teenage son of a local leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf was killed in the shootout resulting in registration of a case against a police officer and his ‘private’ aide and suspension of the area SHO.
The 18-year-old boy, Arsalan Mehsud, was shot dead on Monday night in Orangi Town No 5.
The police later claimed that he was an armed bandit, who was chased and killed by a patrolling party of the Orangi Town police while he was running away after committing a street crime with his aide who also got wounded, but managed to run away.
The details were unveiled when the injured friend of the victim shared his version of the incident with the family that resulted a strong reaction from area people and PTI workers.
Opposition leader in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh visited the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital in the early hours where the body of Arsalan was brought for an autopsy.
He said that the city police had become a threat for the people of the metropolis. He also slammed the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party for “recruitment in police against bribes”.
He requested the Sindh governor to take notice of the incident.
Amid a strong protest, the police lodged an FIR and arrested the policeman, identified as Tauheed, who shot Arsalan. Later, it emerged that the policeman was in plain clothes and was accompanied by a friend, named Umair.
“The uncle of the deceased filed a written application, which has been turned into an FIR,” said an official. “It blames Tauheed and Umair for trying to snatch the motorbike from Arsalan and his friend. On their resistance they fired shots which killed Arsalan and left his friend wounded. Both the suspects have been arrested and a case has also been registered against them.”
The police said that the FIR was lodged under Sections 302 (premeditated murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997.
Meanwhile, DIG-West Nasir Aftab while taking notice of the incident ordered suspension of the area SHO and set up an investigation committee headed by SSP-Central to probe into the incident. Other members of the team are the SP Investigation West and the SP-Gulberg.

3,Patients suffer as young doctors shut OPDs across Sindh,Pakistan Medical Association says it opposes any means of protest that affect patient services.,"KARACHI: Poor patients’ sufferings were compounded on Tuesday as outpatient department (OPD) services at public sector hospitals across Sindh remained closed for the second consecutive day on the call of Young Doctors Association (YDA)-Sindh.
The hospitals were earlier hit by protests of nurses, who stopped performing at general wards.
Reacting to this situation, the Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) stated that it opposed any means of protest that affected patient services.
“The association does not support and approve of circumstances in which the poor segments of society, already under tremendous stress, suffer. However, the association denounces the use of brutal force, baton-charge and arrest of protesting doctors [by law enforcement agencies],” said PMA-Sindh president Dr Mirza Ali Azhar.

PMA opposes such protests that affect patient services

The association, he explained, supported all genuine demands of healthcare professionals and wanted an amicable solution of this unwarranted situation.
“All people arrested during protests should be released and the best thing would be to get engaged with protesters and negotiate on their demands. We urge the government to initiate this process as soon as possible to thwart the conspiracies of depriving poor people from treatment and creating uncertainty,” he said.
Speaking to Dawn, Dr Mohammad Umer Sultan of the YDA-Sindh said the young doctors didn’t want to create problems for poor patients and that’s the reason why it had been observing only token protests for several days at hospitals and doctors continued to provide services at emergency units, operation theatres and general wards.
“But, unfortunately, there was no positive outcome, compelling us to go on a complete suspension of OPD services,” he said, adding the protest would continue till demands of the association were met.
The association is demanding an increase in risk allowance and salaries of postgraduate trainees and house officers and regularisation of all contract doctors.
“The government should make the health risk allowance a permanent feature and resolve the matter of doctors’ transfers at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and National Institute of Child Health,” Dr Sultan said.
The government, he said, should also announce 500 seats of dental surgeons and make a separate cadre for the hiring of medico-legal officers.
A day earlier, scores of nurses were thrashed, baton-charged and briefly detained by the police when they tried to march on Chief Minister House. Most of their demands have been accepted by the government.

The health department confirmed the death of Dr Mehmood-ul-Hasan Jafri, 44, and said it would receive a detailed report on Wednesday (today).
This was the first reported death of a doctor from dengue this year.
Sources at the JPMC said Dr Jafri’s death came as a shock to his colleagues as he was diagnosed with dengue only three days back and, apparently, had no other health issues.
Sources at the private hospital where he remained under treatment said the doctor was brought to its emergency unit on Dec 5 with complaints of fever and difficulty in breathing.
“He was found severely dehydrated on examination and developed renal and liver failure. He tested positive for dengue,” a doctor at the hospital said.

KARACHI: The facade of the building or whatever remains of it now might help the imagination somewhat recreate, though with difficulty, what the Kakumal Asoomal Hindu Dharamshala must have looked like all those years ago.
Built in 1932, the Dharamshala was a rest house for Hindu pilgrims who would travel from afar to the Baghani Temple here. According to the Hindu community, the Dharamshala land of about 716 square yards in size situated at Napier Quarters in Saddar Town caught the eye of the builder mafia, who planned to build a shopping centre in its place.
On the plea of the Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) to safeguard the Dharamshala, the Supreme Court of Pakistan on June 11 had ordered the Heritage Department as well as the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) not to demolish any part of this building.
The order had also proposed a task force for promoting tolerance and establishing a police unit to protect the places of worship of minorities. It also directed the commissioner of Karachi to take over the building so that no person trespassed upon the premises.

But despite the SC order the demolition could not be stopped. Today it is just a pile of rubble behind a hollow facade. Its grilled steel gate entrance is blocked by rubble. Neither can it be pushed or pulled open. Soon it will be completely razed to the ground and forgotten as another structure will come up in its place to add to Karachi’s new skyline.
It has been alleged by the Pakistan Hindu Council that the ETPB forged a no-objection certificate from the Sindh heritage department for the demolition of the Dharamshala.
Speaking to Dawn, Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, the patron-in-chief of the PHC, aired his sadness over the matter.
“I have requested the Supreme Court to at least transfer control of the premises to the management of the nearby Baghani Temple now. I have also asked for an inquiry by the Federal Investigation Agency into the alleged forgery by the ETPB and the resultant demolition of the heritage property,” he said.

6,‘We are responsible for miserable circumstances of people of Sindh’,"KARACHI: “If you go to a village in Sindh, you’ll see no difference in the level of humans and animals there....","KARACHI: “If you go to a village in Sindh, you’ll see no difference in the level of humans and animals there. They are all covered in the same dirt,” said noted writer Noorul Huda Shah.
She was speaking at a seminar on Sindh’s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) organised by the Sindh Directorate of Urban and Regional Policy (SDURP) in collaboration with the European Union’s Technical Assistance Team at a local hotel here on Tuesday.
“Many of us have our roots in Sindh. But after reaching certain positions despite coming from humble backgrounds we forget our base. When we talk of poverty in our nice big air-conditioned rooms while enjoying cushy positions, ‘poverty’ is just a technical word. The biggest problem is that we are ourselves responsible for the miserable circumstances of the people of Sindh,” she added.
“Most of the people in Sindh’s villages are suffering from Hepatitis C. The issue of health there is painful. Women there die in pain while being carried to hospitals on donkey carts. Their blood is on our hands,” she said.
“During election time, there is celebration and a festival-type atmosphere in our villages. There is song and music. Men dance to the beat of the drums. And after the votes have been cast, the people go back to their dusty and dirty environs. Don’t they even deserve an ambulance? Their lives are limited. Their wishes limited. But giving them their due would mean progress for this country. Sweeping them under the rug is not progress,” she said.
While sharing his presentation on the PRS, the Strategic Adviser of the EU-funded Sindh Union Council Community and Economic Strengthening Support (Success) programme’s technical assistance team, Dr Kaiser Bengali looked at the pilot project’s implementation in Chuhar Jamali, a small town in Sujawal district.
The Sindh government has selected this town for a pilot project to implement the PRS. This includes the implementation of the town-to-market infrastructure, improvement in the quality of education, healthcare, water supply and drainage. This would be supplemented by the construction of quality roads to facilitate access to the Rural Growth Centres (RGC), which also includes the upgrade of 17 existing roads totalling 203kms in a 30km radius.
“The consolidation of infrastructure and services around the town of Chuhar Jamali would result in poverty alleviation and improvement of the living standards of the people there,” said Dr Bengali.
He also said that the project team had identified at least four RGC sites in district Thatta, which would be developed. “Gharo is identified for education, Ghorabari for health, Ver for the economic centre and Jhimpir (Keenjhar Lake) and Keti Bunder (coast area) as tourist sites.”
Coming back to Chuhar Jamali, he said that if implemented in full, all these things can turn it into a model for what the rural scene and life can be. He said that the process to date has had the full support of the higher echelons of the government. But implementation is now the domain of the district level administrations.
“This is where there is danger of a slowdown. Therefore active political support is urgently needed if all the work done so far is not to be confined to files because our work ends on Dec 31,” he said.

7,Agreement inked for potable water supply to Karachi,Sindh chief minister says the project will include water treatment facilities and a bulk water conveyance system.,"KARACHI: The Sindh government and International Finance Corporation (IFC) signed an agreement on Tuesday to help the provincial government in a public-private partnership project for supplying clean drinking water to nearly one million people.
With a population of over 16 million, Karachi has been struggling to maintain reliable fresh water supply, said Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah while speaking at the ceremony held at the CM House.
He added that under the agreement, the IFC would advise the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) on structuring and tendering a project to build new infrastructure to boost the city’s water supply.
The CM said the project, to be executed by a private company, would include water treatment facilities and a bulk water conveyance system. The system would supply city with 65 mgd from Keenjhar Lake, he added.
“By bringing in the private sector to develop and operate a bulk water supply system, more people will have access to the water they need,” he said, adding: “The project will provide the framework for future green-field water infrastructure projects.”
IFC senior vice president Stephanie von Friedeburg said on the occasion that the project was Pakistan’s first green-field water supply initiative carried out under a public-private partnership.
She said water scarcity in Karachi had affected residents and hampered businesses for many years.
She added that the project demonstrated the power of the private sector to help governments modernise infrastructure, jumpstart economic growth and improve the lives of everyday people.

8,Plea against show-cause notices in harassment case dismissed,KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday dismissed a petition of the K-Electric chief and three senior officials...,"KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Tuesday dismissed a petition of the K-Electric chief and three senior officials against a show-cause notice issued by the ombudsman for allegedly harassing a former colleague.
A two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Ahmed Ali M. Shaikh directed the chief executive officer of the power utility and three other members of the senior management to file replies to the show-cause notice before the ombudsman.
They had filed a petition last year against the Ombudsman for Protection Against Harassment of Women at Workplace Sindh and a former female colleague who had filed a complaint before the ombudsman, who subsequently issued them show-cause notices.
The petitioners submitted that the woman in question was appointed consultant in October 2019 for 35 days and in December she was appointed a full-time employee on a contractual basis as chief marketing & communication officer. In October 2020 she was sacked.
While referring to the contentions of the petitioners’ lawyer, the bench ruled that there was no bar in the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010 that a woman only during her employment can file a complaint regarding alleged sexual harassment at the workplace.
It is pertinent to mention here that the acts of harassment as claimed by the complainant had allegedly taken place in the office of KE during the period when she was working there, it added.
The bench further observed that the woman in her complaint also stated that her service was wrongfully terminated and to support her stand of sexual harassment at the workplace she along with her complaint had filed multiple transcripts of messages.
However, it said that since the matter was sub judice before the ombudsman and no evidence had so far been recorded, the bench members were refraining themselves from expressing anything.
About another contention of the petitioners’ lawyer that she did not raise her voice or file a complaint during her employment, the bench said that she in her complaint claimed that during employment in the months of July and September 2020 she verbally complained to the board of directors of KE but in October her service was terminated conceivably in retaliation and she filed a complaint in November before the ombudsman.
Regarding quashment of the show-cause notices, the bench said that it would be premature to pass such an order as evidence in the matter was yet to be recorded and soon after issuance of the impugned show-cause notices the petitioners had approached this court and since then no progress had been made in the proceedings pending before the ombudsman.
The petitioners are directed to file their reply to the show-cause notices, which will be considered on its own merits, it concluded.

KARACHI: The city of Karachi has inexplicable magnetism. Despite the cacophony and hullabaloo that’s the hallmark of the Third World’s urban culture those who are born or raised here never find it easy to take it out of their system — its cosmopolitanism, its constantly on-the-go life, its diverse population. Once a Karachiite, always a Karachiite.
An exhibition of Khalid Khan — Kaay’s artworks titled Tribute, which is under way at the Art Scene Gallery — gives off a similar vibe of love for the city by the sea.
Khan’s tribute to the Sindh capital has, in cinematic terms, a wide-angle feel to it. From faces to pictures of boats and from children’s rides to the old colonial buildings which need care and respect, the artist covers all with a fair degree of nostalgia. Perhaps nostalgia is not the right word, but what one intends to imply is that he wants to preserve the images that stay with him as part of his creative and physical upbringing. He does that by using free-flowing strokes and colours that truly represent the activity filled days and evenings of the megapolis, which distinguish it from the rest of Pakistani towns.
In his statement Khan writes, “I left Karachi 26 years ago but it seems that Karachi has never left me. This is the city where I was born and grew up, making lots of memories. Every time I visit the city, it feels like time travel. Even though the city has changed a lot over the years, I never get lost when I go for a walkabout… Pakistan Chowk, Saddar, Kharadar, Ranchhor Line, Ratan Talao, Bolton Market, Lea Market, Denso Hall, etc, are my favourite parts of the city. It is sad to witness the deterioration of these places.”
This sadness of the artist results in that ‘unappeased yearning to return’ to a space where life becomes nothing but a bundle of memories. It also results in the creation of some eye-catching works of art.
The exhibition concludes on Dec 10.

11,‘Success achieved in increasing vulture population’,KARACHI: Population of critically threatened vultures has been successfully stabilised and gradually increasing ...,"KARACHI: Population of critically threatened vultures has been successfully stabilised and gradually increasing under a three-year project and now there is an immediate need to maintain this remarkable achievement through continued effective participation of the community, wildlife experts, government agencies as well as the corporate sector, said speakers at a programme held in a local hotel on Tuesday.
Jointly organised by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), the ‘Vulture Symposium’ highlighted how success was achieved in vulture conservation in Thar over the last three years.
The project is implemented by the IUCN with support from the wildlife department, Baanhn Beli, SECMC and Thar Foundation.
Giving a presentation on the programme, senior ecologist Dr Z.B. Mirza said the objectives of the project were to recover the vulture population in Thar after carrying out a detailed analysis of the situation, a baseline survey and later introducing interventions.
About the decline in vulture population over three decades, Dr Mirza said the bird had slow reproduction as the flesh eating vultures laid one egg at the age of five. In the mid 1990s, he pointed out, their population started declining fast and a drug ‘Diclofenac’ commonly used by vets was found responsible for causing their mortality.
“When a vulture eats the remains of an animal that had residues of this toxic drug in the meat, it suffers mortality,” he explained.
Mahmood Akhtar Cheema, IUCN country representative Pakistan, said the vulture population in Pakistan had steeply declined over the last 20 years or so, and accelerated and joint efforts were now under way to save those large, magnificent birds, from the many threats they had been facing.
Former senator Javed Jabbar, who held top positions in the IUCN, explained the culture and ecology of Thar and how the region had evolved over the time and why it was important to conserve its pristine biodiversity and environment.
SECMC chief executive officer Amir Iqbal noted that the company was fully engaged in wildlife preservation efforts and trying to contribute towards biodiversity conservation in Thar.

12,PTI holds rallies in several districts against amendments to LG law,"KARACHI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday held rallies in Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Thatta, Kandhkot-Kashmore ...","KARACHI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Tuesday held rallies in Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Thatta, Kandhkot-Kashmore and some other districts to mobilise workers and supporters for the rejection of the amendments to the Local Government law proposed by Sindh government.
In Hyderabad, Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh addressed a demonstration outside the local press club and vowed to hold protests across Sindh if the provincial government did not withdraw the bill adopted by the assembly for the amendments. Protests would also be held outside Bilawal House and CM House in Karachi, he added.
Mr Sheikh argued that through these amendments, the LG system was being made dependent on Bilawal House. The ruling party was trying to introduce ‘jageerdari system’ through backdoor, he said.
He described it as a ‘black law’, and said the Pakistan Peoples Party was trying to bring in a tyrannical jageerdari system. He deplored that the bill was declared adopted while a debate on it was still under way in the house.
He also pointed out that the bill was presented in the assembly without sharing it on the agenda. “When the bill was being tabled, the face reading of the chief minister and LG minister clearly reflected that a big conspiracy has been hatched against Sindh,” he remarked.
The PTI leader said that PPP had in 2013 introduced a dual local government system. Now powers of mayor and deputy mayor were being snatched and delegated to provincial government, he added.
“[PPP co-chairman Asif Ali] Zardari needs one-window operation; one individual will collect the entire money,” he said.
Mr Sheikh also pointed out that earlier the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) and Karachi and Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) had been handed over to Sindh government.
“Under the proposed LG law, anyone can be made mayor or chairman of a town committee which shows that the law is being introduced to violate sanctity of vote,” he said.
He accused the ruling party of having become “traders of votes and notes”. They wanted to occupy the LG system, he alleged.
The opposition leader said that Article 140-A of the Constitution provided that the financial, administrative and political authority and responsibility should be devolved to local government system. LGs had been stripped of taxation authority, he added.
He said opposition members in the Sindh Assembly were not provided the bill even for a reading.
He said the PPP government had centralised powers. Every authority has been delegated to provincial ministers. The LG system has become personal fief of Bilawal House. He said the LG bill had many ambiguities and it was not also clear on ‘term’ and ‘election’.
“PTI wants a law that empowers people’s representatives. [Through the bill], PPP has ensured that no political activist becomes a mayor or chairman of a town committee and that only the wealthy ones hold the slots and that, too, without a vote,” he said.
Feudal lords were being encouraged to keep LGs comprising their own family members, he added.
PTI MNA Jai Parkash, Khawand Bux Jahejo, Q. Hakim and others also spoke.
DADU: PTI activists and supporters led by Haleem Adil Sheikh took out a rally from Jilani House to Al-Madina Chowk in Kotri town. Carrying banners and placards inscribed with slogans against the proposed LG law, they raised slogans against the PPP government and the amendments being made to the law.
Mr Sheikh addressed the participants at Al-Madina Chowk and appealed to the people of Sindh to oppose the ‘black law’ tooth and nail as it would rob them of their right to vote and contest in the LG election, besides having their genuinely elected representatives in this institution.
THATTA: Haleem Adil Sheikh, MNA Jai Parkash and PTI’s Thatta district president Raees Arsalan Brohi led a rally from Edhi Centre to the local press club on Tuesday.
The participants were wearing black armbands and carrying banners and placards while raising slogans against the proposed LG law.
The leaders spoke at the rally and resolved to resist its enactment in order to save the entire province from falling into the hands of feudal lords.

14,SHC suspends interim order on ex-Hesco CEO’s removal,HYDERABAD: A division bench of the Sindh High Court on Tuesday suspended the Dec 1 interim order passed by a...,"HYDERABAD: A division bench of the Sindh High Court on Tuesday suspended the Dec 1 interim order passed by a single-judge bench on a matter pertaining to the termination of services of Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) chief executive officer Rehan Hamid.
The bench comprising Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi and Ms Rashida Asad passed the order on the appeal filed by Hesco against the Dec 1 order. It fixed the matter for Dec 14.
On Dec 1, the single-judge bench had suspended operation of two notifications dated Nov 26 under which Rehan Hamid was removed as the Hesco CEO and Noor Ahmed Soomro was appointed in his place. The order was passed on a suit filed by respondent Rehan Hamid.
Syed Haider Imam Rizvi, the counsel for appellant Hesco, argued that the suit filed by Rehan Hamid seeking declaration of permanent injunctions and damages was not maintainable on account of jurisdiction.
He submitted that there was a relationship of masters and servant between the appellant (Hesco) and Rehan Hamid and, therefore, relief of reinstatement could not be granted whereas impugned notification was already acted upon.
He stated that a new Hesco CEO had taken over the charge, and contended that the Dec 1 order was obtained through misrepresentation of facts whereas interim relief granted to respondent was contrary to law and judgements of superior courts in this regard.
He recalled that superior courts had held that in case of master and servant, relief of damages could be claimed alone and employee could not be reinstated in service.
The counsel submitted that the impugned notifications were suspended without hearing the other party. The appellant prayed that the impugned order be suspended as an anomaly was created. The court issued pre admission notice to respondents for Dec 14.
Hesco has in its appeal argued that during tenure of respondent Rehan Hamid, an unfortunate incident occurred on July 22, 2021 in Latifabad Unit-8 in which many precious lives were lost and many others were injured. He said that as the CEO, he failed to discharge his duties and obligations efficiently.
Advocate Rizvi argued that the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) issued show-cause notice to the CEO on Aug 9 but he failed to deal with matter professionally, leading to the imposition of a penalty of Rs26m against Hesco by Nepra. He said due to the CEO’s inefficiency, Hesco not only suffered financial losses but faced an embarrassing situation.
The counsel claimed that the CEO was found to have been looking for avenues for his personal gains in terms of financial aspects and public image.
He said that Hesco’s board of governor approved termination of the CEO’s employment contract by respondent ministry and formalities under Public Sector Companies Rules 2017 were complied with by the competent authority. He said CEO’s suit was barred under relevant Act.

They were speaking at a seminar on ‘Halt soil salinization, boost soil productivity’ held to mark the World Soil Day at Sindh Agriculture University (SAU), Tandojam, on Monday.
The moot was organised in collaboration with Soil Science Society of Pakistan, Soil Science Department and Farm Advisory Centre (FFC).
SAU vice chancellor Dr Fateh Marri said that climate change, poor quality of groundwater in agricultural land and seawater intrusion were main causes for the increasing salinity.
He announced establishment of a bio-saline agriculture centre in the university and said that with focus on reducing soil’s salinity, research on crop cultivation on saline affected lands should be intensified.
Dr Inayatullah Rajpar, chairman of the Depart­ment of Soil Science, said that agricultural land in Sindh was affected by salinity but no survey for gauging the extent of salinity ahd been conducted in the province for a long time. Currently, salinity affected 6.3 million hectares of land, he said.
