2,Karachiites to pay Rs7.22bn more for power used in September,KE procures 53 per cent electricity at cheaper rates from national grid.,"ISLAMABAD: The National Ele­c­tric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Tuesday allowed K-Electric to charge Rs3.76 per unit additional cost to its consumers in December bills under monthly fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for electricity consumed in September to generate about Rs7.22bn.
The regulator had conducted on Nov 3 a public hearing on KE’s request for an increase of Rs3.454 per unit for September. In a petition submitted to Nepra under Multi-Year Tariff 2017-23, KE had requested the regulator to allow the company to pass on the burden of Rs6.639bn to the power consumers in its service area under monthly FCA for September.
Nepra chairman Tauseef H. Farooqui had then observed that such an additional charge “is huge and will be shocking for consumers”. However, in a notification issued on Tuesday, the regulator allowed KE to charge Rs3.757 per unit additional FCA to all consumers categories except lifeline consumers in December billing. The additional FCA would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in September.

KE procures 53pc electricity at cheaper rates from national grid

In its determination, the regulator explained that KE had used the cost of energy purchased from national grid at rates approved by regulator for other ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) for August because the September rates were not available at the time.
However, as the energy cost for Discos for September was later notified by the regulator, these were also incorporated for the energy purchased by KE from Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). “This has resulted in increase in total fuel cost by around Rs659.9 million,” the regulator said. This took the total demand to Rs7.29bn. After certain minor deductions, Nepra allowed KE to charge Rs7.22bn to consumers at the rate of Rs3.76 per unit.
The regulator pointed out that the power purchase agreement (PPA) was signed between National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) and K-Electric on Jan 26, 2010 for five years for sale/purchase of 650MW on basket rates. Subsequently, a decision was made by the Council of Common Interests (CCI) on Nov 8, 2012 for withdrawal of about 300MW from KE. 
However, the said decision of the CCI had been impugned through suits and petitions by KE in Sindh High Court. No new agreement had been signed between K-Electric and NTDC till date, and KE continues to draw about 1,100MW energy from the national grid.
The regulator also highlighted that KE did not operate Korangi and Site Gas Turbine Power Stations) to their full capacities, and drew less energy from efficient sources. Similarly, another plant Korangi Combined Cycle Power Plant was also operated on expensive high-speed diesel. 
Nepra also noted that according to KE, it was in discussions with the federal government and CPPA for around 2,050MW firm capacity from the national grid, and work on interconnection grids were being carried out. However, in case the required capacity is not provided by national grid and at the same time, KE has not installed its own power plants, this may result in loadshedding.
KE had generated 47pc electricity from its own power plants and procured 53pc from the national grid. The regulator noted that it was clear that the federal government was providing cheaper electricity to KE.

Mr Khan became SECP’s commissioner in December 2018 and was later elevated to the position of chairman in August 2019. 
Sources in the finance ministry said Prime Minister’s Adviser on Finance Shaukat Tarin had apprised the federal cabinet of significant reforms featuring legal, structural, regulatory, operational and product development initiatives by the SECP in the past three years. 
Mr Khan is also the only chairman of the corporate sector regulator in over a decade to complete a three-year term. 
Muhammad Ali Ghulam Muhammad was appointed as the commission’s chairman in December 2010 but was removed by a court in April 2013 before completing his term. 
Zafar Hijazi was appointed as the chairman in December 2014 but was removed in July 2017 in the wake of a court case related to money laundering. 
In May 2018, Shaukat Hussain was given the slot, but he was replaced soon when the incumbent government took charge. He was replaced in December 2018 by Farrukh Sabzwari, who was then replaced by the current chairman, Amir Khan, in August 2019. 
The three-year term of Amir Khan as the commissioner expired on Monday (Dec 6), and he has been reappointed as the commissioner as well as the chairman of the SECP.

4,Call to keep sales tax on used clothes at 5pc,KARACHI: Used cloth merchants on Tuesday urged the government to refrain from increasing sales tax on imported...,"KARACHI: Used cloth merchants on Tuesday urged the government to refrain from increasing sales tax on imported second-hand clothes from five per cent to 17pc as it would result in huge price hike for consumers and badly hit the masses.  
Worn clothing and other used articles are imported under PCT 6309 0000. These items attract a sales tax of 5pc along with 5pc import duty, 10pc regulatory duty and 5.5pc withholding tax, taking the cumulative impact of duties and taxes to 25.5pc. 
General Secretary of Pakistan Second Hand Clothing Merchants Association (PSHCMA) Mohammad Usman Farooqui said the government was planning to bring sales tax at 17pc on many imported items including worn clothing under the IMF conditions which would be announced in the mini-budget shortly. 
“The cost of imports has already swelled manifold this year due to rupee’s devaluation from May to date. One dollar is now equal to Rs176 versus Rs152-153 in the interbank market in May. Rising freight has put imports under pressure,” he said. “Second-hand/worn clothing is mainly used by the poorest of the poor who cannot afford to buy new articles. Second-hand clothing is used especially in the northern parts of the country during winter.”

5,Punjab textile industry decries gas tariff hike,Punjab minister Mian Aslam Iqbal assures All Pakistan Textile Mills Association delegation of taking up issue with federal govt.,"LAHORE: Punjab’s textile industry on Tuesday expressed concern over increase in gas tariff from $6.5 to $9 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for export-oriented units in the province and urged the federal government to withdraw the revised rates at the earliest.  
Meanwhile, Punjab Minister for Industries Mian Aslam Iqbal assured a delegation of All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) of taking up the issue with the federal government.  “I will take up the issue of gas price hike from $6.5 per mmBtu to $9 per mmBtu for export-oriented units in Punjab with the federal government at all appropriate levels as it has led to a huge price disparity among provinces,” Mr Iqbal said.  
The Aptma delegation, led by its chairman (Northern Zone) Hamid Zaman, briefed the minister about the gas price disparity between Punjab and other provinces. Gas prices in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are $4.87 per mmBtu compared to Punjab where rates have been hiked to $9 per mmBtu.  
Mr Zaman said gas price of $4.05 per mmBtu in Bangladesh and $5.19 per mmBtu in India was also much lower than the tariff applicable to Punjab-based export industry. 
“The Regionally Competitive Energy Tariff provided by the current government over the past three years has yielded outstanding results. The industry has invested Rs450 billion in machinery for capacity enhancement as per commitment,” he added.

7,Ginners contest govt figures on cotton output,Debate rages over gap of over two million bales.,"LAHORE: The Cotton Crop Assessment Committee (CCAC) on Tuesday reignited controversy on cotton production in the country when it put its estimation at 9.1 million bales – a figure that flies in the face of Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association estimates. 
The PCGA – the first consumer and receiver of crop in its processing chain – had put the figure at 7.16 million bales in its Dec 3 report, leaving a gap of whopping two million bales in national production figures. 
As per the CCAC estimates, Punjab produced 5.16 million bales, Balochistan 0.43 million bales, Sindh 3.5 million bales and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 40,000 bales, taking total figure at 9.1 million bales. 
Interestingly, Punjab also reported achieving 100 per cent target of wheat sowing, which means that entire cotton crop is now harvested and should be in the ginning factories for processing. If 9.1 million bales have left the field and only 7.1 million had reached ginning factories, where have two million bales gone? The debate is raging in Punjab. 
Some insiders say that the CCAC, during the Tuesday meeting, was advised not to commit any figure because of massive gap between the official and business figures. Ignoring the counsel, the CCAC, however, decided to go public with figures and added few more decibels to the debate. During the meeting, growers’ representatives also questioned Punjab figure of 5.16 million bales. 
A senior official of the Punjab agriculture department, requesting anonymity, did concede that the provincial figures might have been on the higher side. However, he did insist that it may not be as low as being put by the PCGA, which says that Punjab is stuck at 3.6 million bales. The provincial agriculture management thinks since 17 per cent general sales tax has been slapped on cotton seed sale, the ginners, some of whom also own  textile mills, have interest in depressing arrival data and save taxes. 
Former chairman of the PCGA, Aman Ullah, however, defends his organisation’s figures. Explaining dichotomy between both figures, he says that the Crop Reporting Wing of the Punjab bases its estimations on acreage and production sampling. “Say, if a 100-acre plot is sown in Rahim Yar Khan but yield travels to some mills in Sindh, the Punjab would naturally multiply those acres with its estimated average yield and include in its tally. The PCGA, however, does not do it. It only takes those bales in its record, which have crossed factory gates – regardless of origin of crop.

8,Hascol to achieve debt restructuring soon,KARACHI: Hascol Petroleum Ltd on Tuesday said it’s about to conclude negotiations with bankers to address its...,"KARACHI: Hascol Petroleum Ltd on Tuesday said it’s about to conclude negotiations with bankers to address its “heavy burden of accumulated debt”. 
In a statement posted on the website of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, company chairman Sir Alan Duncan told investors that the troubled oil marketing company would soon be able to announce a restructuring agreement, which would involve replacing short-term expensive debt with long-term affordable debt and some new equity. 
Hascol has been in financial trouble since 2018. Its revenues have dropped, losses mounted and loans risen, sending its share price down from over Rs300 three years ago to just over Rs6 apiece in recent days. 
“If and when we succeed in this refinancing of the company, your board is confident that [the company will]… be restored as a profitable concern,” said Mr Duncan. 
Its net consolidated loss amounted to Rs25.2 billion for calendar year 2020 versus a net loss of Rs35.1bn in 2019. It’s not filed its financial accounts for any post-2020 period. The company also discovered “inaccurate entries in its 2019 accounts” and subsequently restated its results from 2018 through 2020. 
Regulatory actions against the company in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for unauthorised storage and selling of petroleum products also marred its reputation last year. 
Referring to the build-up of liabilities on its balance sheet, Mr Duncan said servicing that debt has cost as much as the scale of the company’s losses. “Hascol’s main pressure is that it has been seriously constrained by tight liquidity,” he said after hailing the government’s “positive steps on forex protection and retail margins” that will help oil marketing companies. 
The company’s short-term borrowings alone amounted to Rs33bn, down 10.7 per cent from the preceding year. According to the notes attached to the 2020 financial statements, these short-term loans from different banks were at interest rates ranging from one-month Karachi interbank offered rate (Kibor) plus 1.5pc to as high as Kibor plus 20pc. 
As part of its plan to regain financial strength, the company is trying to convince banks to “partially convert their outstanding debt into equity” in order to reduce its “onerous debt service obligations”. 
Besides, the management is looking for a “significant reduction” in its operating costs, recapturing its market share, disposal of non-core assets, shoring up of working capital and the raising of additional equity to reduce leverage.

9,Cellphone imports plunge 73pc,"“Our vision is to make Pakistan a hub of mobile phone manufacturing and export,"" says Adviser on Commerce Razak Dawood.","ISLAMABAD: The import of manufactured or completely built units (CBU) declined by 73 per cent year-on-year to $179 million in the first five months of the current fiscal year from $661m a year ago. 
The drop helped save $410m in foreign exchange for the country owing to the implementation of the mobile manufacturing policy, Adviser on Commerce Razak Dawood said on Tuesday. 
In contrast, the import of mobile phone components for local assembly increased by 407pc to $674m from $133m last year. He further said locally assembled mobile phones are cheaper than $200 as a result of this policy. 

Local mobile phone assembly picks up pace

In Pakistan, about 80pc to 85pc of the market is for phones priced at $200 or below. As a result of the mobile policy – which contains duty incentives for enhancing mobile phone assembling in the country – majority of phones under $200 are now being assembled in Pakistan. 
In terms of market shares, the Chinese manufacturers control about half of the market as they were quick to utilise the incentives offered by the government and hence have the “First-Mover’s advantage” in the market. 
These assemblers are importing mobiles in semi-knocked down condition which are then assembled in Pakistan. This is not only saving foreign exchange but also boosting industrial activity and creating employment. Mr Dawood said Sams­ung has also recently started assembling mobile phones in Pakistan. 
“All over the world, smartphones have now become a necessity as many SMEs now run their businesses on mobile phones. At the start of this government, Pakistan was a net importer of mobile phones but the situation has now been reversed and jobs are also being created in this sector,” the adviser said.  
“Our vision is to make Pakistan a hub of mobile phone manufacturing and export. The export of mobile phones will soon start that will earn foreign exchange for the country,” Mr Dawood added.
