The patwaris had been booked by ACE for presenting fake domiciles of Gujrat district for securing the job and a case was lodged against them under sections 420, 468 and 471 of the Pakistan Penal Code. They were later granted bail by a court.

Expressing displeasure over the absence of the secretary, officers and officials during a surprise visit to the tourism department head office, the chief minister said those failing to attend their offices in time had no right to remain on their posts as its sheer negligence.
“I have directed to initiate disciplinary action against staff and observance of time would be ensured in offices. I would pay surprise visits to departments to monitor performance as well as officers’ attendance,” he said and announced indiscriminate action against officers and staff failing to reach offices in time.
The government officials should mend their ways as “I am deeply disappointed over the vacant tourism office,” he said.
PDM: The Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) would avoid holding a long march like its earlier claim of tendering resignations from the assemblies, says Chief Minister Usman Buzdar.
In a statement issued here on Tuesday, he said that announcing a long march on Pakistan Day was totally unjustified and the visionless politicians should avoid achieving political gains on a national day. “It is an attempt to divide the nation,” he said.
The chief minister advised the PDM to revisit its negative attitude as the nation would never forgive its anarchistic designs.

“This step [tariff hike] will further increase inflation in the country and make the people’s lives more miserable who are [already] finding it hard to make both ends meet,” the PML-N president said in a statement here on Tuesday.
He said the government was succumbing to the IMF’s demands and increasing prices of electricity and gas, and imposing new taxes.
Shehbaz asked the government to tell the people as to why it was not reducing the prices of petroleum despite the decrease in rates in the international market.
“Why is the government not giving relief to the masses and not ready to trickle down its impact,” he asked.
He said the nation should rightly call Imran Khan a ‘thief prime minister’ after the over 30 percent depreciation of rupee during his three-year tenure. The masses should not be punished for Khan’s incompetence and corruption, he added.
Meanwhile, PML-N Punjab Information Secretary Azma Bokhari said the PTI spokesperson got unnerved after the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) announced a long march.
“We ask Imran Khan to keep a container ready in Islamabad. Why Imran Khan and his army of spokespersons is afraid of the opposition’s long march,” she said.
The opposition alliance, Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), has announced a long march on Islamabad against price hike in the country on the Pakistan Day on March 23.

3,KEMC BoG stops dean’s posting due to ‘legal issues’,LAHORE: The King Edward Medical College (KEMC) Board of Governors (BoGs) has carried out the appointment process of...,"LAHORE: The King Edward Medical College (KEMC) Board of Governors (BoGs) has carried out the appointment process of Dean KEMC/Mayo Hospital allegedly in violation of the Medical Teaching Institutes (MTI) Act.
KEMC BoG chairman Prof Mahmood Shaukat, however, says the board has stopped the result after the interviews due to legal issues.
The Prime Minister’s Task Force on Health is overseeing the reforms introduced through the MTI Act in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. The historic KEMC/Mayo Hospital is the first institute in Lahore to have been picked in the first phase to enforce the MTI Act.
The KEMC board instead of constituting a selection committee which is mandatory in the MTIs regulations to conduct interviews of the candidates, carried out the process of dean’s appointment on its own. An official said the issue surfaced when National Health Reforms chairman Dr Nausherwan Barki pointed out the violation during his recent visit to the institute. He said the selection process of the dean might have been scrapped as Mr Barki expressed his utter displeasure over the move.
The official said Mr Barki asked the BoG to follow uniformity in this respect as per the regulations of the Policy Board.
The MTI Act says, “the 10-member high-powered policy board shall recommend model regulations and other policies and amendments therein to be framed by the Board of each Medical Teaching Institution.” The section 6 b of the regulations say “the BoG is supposed to constitute an 8-member selection committee.”
“The committee shall consist of at least four representatives at associate professor or higher level from at least two clinical and two basic science departments, a non-clinical representative from the Hospital, designated by the Hospital Director, a representative of the nursing department, and a layperson of repute nominated by the BoGs.
“The Board shall designate a chairman of the committee from the members of the selection committee and the committee may co-opt two further members if it feels that further expertise is necessary,” reads the MTI Act.
The policy board had approved the procedure to constitute a committee to interview and recommend the candidate for the post.
Sharing details about the violation of the procedure, the official said the BoG chairman invited applications from the interested candidates for the post of dean KEMC through email instead of following the process. He said 21 candidates applied for the post in August this year. Of them, 15 appeared in the interviews in October and five were shortlisted for a second round of interviews which were conducted by the same panel.
The official said the interviews were held by the BoG rather than a committee which shocked some candidates. Even the internal merit was not displayed for the candidates at the time of interviews indicating a lack of transparency in the process, he said. Even after two months of interviews, he said, the result had not been announced.
Prof Mahmood Shaukat clarified that the board was not bound to follow the regulations as pointed out by Dr Barki during his recent visit to the institute. He said Mr Barki had nothing to do with the MTI Act in Punjab. The BoG conducted interviews through known teaching faculty members from across the province, he said, adding that it stopped the results due to legal issues.
“The BOG has officially informed the Punjab chief secretary about the development,” Prof Shaukat said.

One of the women later lodged a complaint with Millat Town police station, stating she was collecting solid waste with her three female companions on Monday around 10:30am at the Bawa Chak Market, Yousaf Chowk, when she felt thirsty and went inside a shop -- Usman Electric Store -- owned by one Saddam and asked for a bottle of water.
She said Saddam got annoyed and yelled at them and alleged that they entered his shop to steal money and electronic appliances. She stated that Saddam also called other shopkeepers and his helpers, who started beating them.
The complainant alleged that the suspects also stripped them and dragged them through the market.
“They continued to beat us for around an hour and recorded our videos,” she said.
Later, family members of the four women reached the market and pleaded to the suspects to let them go.
The complainant demanded action against the suspects.
Acting on the complaint, the police registered a case against four nominated suspects -- Saddam, Faisal, Zaheer Anwar and Faqeer Hussain (Saddam’s employees) -- and 10 unidentified persons, under sections 354-A (assault or use of criminal force against a woman and stripping her), 509 (violating modesty or causing sexual harassment), 147 (punishment for rioting) and 149 (unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common object) of the the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
A suspect charged under section 354-A can be punished with death or life imprisonment.
City Police Officer (CPO) Dr Abid Khan told Dawn that all the nominated suspects in the case were arrested and the videos also confirmed their involvement in the crime.
Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, taking notice of the incident, sought a report from the Faisalabad regional police officer (RPO) and ordered action against the culprits after conducting a probe.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rao Sardar Ali Khan said the suspects involved in the incident did not deserve any sympathy.
He said the police had arrested all the suspects involved in the incident and further legal action was being taken against them.
Mr Khan said Faisalabad police had first arrested two suspects and later three more were held.
The IGP said a policy of “zero tolerance” was being followed with regard to incidents of violence, harassment and abuse of women and children so that the culprits could be punished severely by the courts.

An anti-terrorism court (ATC) had awarded death sentence, life imprisonment and multiple jail terms to the appellants, Abid Ali alias Malhi and Shafqat Ali alias Bagga, on March 20, 2021.
A two-judge bench, comprising Justice Chaudhry Abdul Aziz and Justice Muhammad Amjad Rafiq, took up the convicts’ appeals and issued notices to the respondents for a date to be fixed later.
The appeals argued that the trial court had handed down the sentence against facts and laws applicable in the case. The appellants were not nominated in the first information report (FIR) and the description in the report was altogether different from their physical features and age, they added.
Gujjarpura police had lodged the FIR on Sept 9, 2020 under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.
The suspects had sexually assaulted the survivor, a French woman of Pakistan origin, in front of her three minor children after dragging her out of her car that had broken down during the night travel on the Sialkot-Lahore Motorway after it ran out of fuel.
The police had recovered a pistol and a club, used in the crime, from the suspects besides their mobile phones. The police traced the suspects with the help of their DNA samples that matched with the blood stains found at the crime scene.

In a statement issued here on Tuesday, he said for the last fifty years the model of governance had been that the issues were politicised without offering any solution, claiming the PTI government broke this tradition and launched welfare projects.
He said on the direction of Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, storage tanks were being constructed at nine places in Lahore where rainwater used to accumulate for days, adding that these projects would complete between February and March next year.
Commenting on the Pakistan Democratic Movement, he said the PDM announced last November that the government would be overthrown by January 2021, but it was still in place. Similarly, he said, the opposition alliance had given a date for long march only to avoid embarrassment.
The SACM added that the government was aware of the effects of inflation on common man, hence it launched Rs120 billion Ehsaas Ration Programme that would provide 30 percent subsidy on various items in a transparent manner.
He said the IMF programme was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed by many countries like Pakistan, adding that difficult decisions had to be taken so that future generations should not rely on such programmes.
He said if the PDM would hold a long march with the permission of the government and in accordance with the rules and regulations, “we would give way to it”.

South Punjab Additional Chief Secretary Saqib Zafar told Dawn at the south Punjab secretariat here that a feasibility study of the proposed plan was in progress. He said he, along with Pakistan Railways Secretary Habib Gilani, inspected the proposed railway route and the track up to the abandoned Baghdadul Jadid railway station near the city on the Sammsatta-Bahawalnagar railway section. The section is not in use of passenger trains and has been kept unused for defence purposes.
The ACS said the safari train service would be introduced on a weekly or bi-weekly basis for the promotion of tourism and attraction of the citizens and tourists. The Lal Sohanra park, he said, was full of scenic beauty along with the abundance of wildlife.
He said the abandoned railway station building which is a heritage in the city must be revived and directed Deputy Commissioner Irfan Ali Kathiya to examine the possibilities to lease out through open advertisement and auction the project to convert the Baghdadul Jadid railway station’s existing building into a fast food centre.
Answering a question, Mr Zafar said a proposal was being examined whether the safari train which would be originating from the Bahawalpur railway station would terminate at the Baghdadul Jadid or Lal Sohanra railway station.
He said that after completing the journey the tourists would be provided the facility of coaches to travel by road up to the Lal Sohanra park. He said the railways’ authorities had given the south Punjab secretariat a green signal to launch the project and also promised cooperation.
The Lal Sohanra park stretches over hundreds of thousands of acres and has forests with vast desert areas, a canal, two lakes and an abundance of wildlife including black bucks, chinkara and blue bulls.
