0,Coal termed hedge against world fuel price volatility,"""It’s indigenous and its price is not pegged to the international market,"" says Engro Energy Ltd CEO Ahsan Zafar Syed.","KARACHI: Coal is on its way out globally as the impact of climate change becomes more obvious by the day. 
But the energy companies involved in mining and coal-based power generation in Pakistan are scaling up their production capacities to ensure “reliable and affordable” electricity going forward. 
“Coal provides us with a hedge against international fuel price volatility. It’s indigenous and its price is not pegged to the international market,” said Engro Energy Ltd CEO Ahsan Zafar Syed while speaking to Dawn in a recent interview. 
His company owns 11.9 per cent shareholding in Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company Ltd (SECMC), which has been mining 3.8 million tonnes of coal every year since 2019. It sells its entire output to Engro Powergen Thar Ltd (EPTL), the country’s only coal-based 660-megawatt power plant that burns indigenous fuel. Engro Energy Ltd owns 50.1pc shares in EPTL. 
“Covid-19 showed us how one event could affect the international fuel supply chains. Economic progress requires indigenous fuel sources to ensure energy security and protection from supply-chain disruptions,” he said. 

Engro Energy CEO says Covid showed how one event can disrupt international supply chains

The contribution of coal to the electricity fuel mix has surged in recent years as an increasing number of power plants on both imported and indigenous coal became part of the national grid. Its share in the total power generation in the first 10 months of 2021 was 20pc. 
Despite a global movement against the use of coal, Mr Syed said SECMC is poised to double its output to 7.6m tonnes per annum by June 2022. The mine’s expansion under the ongoing second phase will coincide with the commissioning of a 330MW power plant by Thar Energy Ltd, whose majority shareholding is with The Hub Power Company (Hubco).  
Another Hubco-sponsored power plant of 330MW, ThalNova Power Thar Ltd, is expected to come on line in September-October next year. Its commissioning will ensure 100pc consumption of the enhanced output of the Thar coal mine. 
The third phase of the mine expansion will then take the output to 12.2m tonnes of coal per annum by June 2023, said Mr Syed. The increased output will supply fuel to the 660MW power plant that the Lucky Group is building at Port Qasim. 
“You can’t even think about abandoning this [mining] project. We must take it to a point where it achieves economic viability. Only then you can pause and think about other options,” said Mr Syed. 
Based on the pricing structure in place for Thar coal, SECMC earns an internal rate of return or IRR of 20pc above the project cost. The price of indigenous coal is currently $61 per tonne, about half of the rate prevailing in the international market. 
Thar coal’s price will come down to $42 per tonne upon the completion of the ongoing second phase, he said. Thanks to the economies of scale, it’ll further drop to $27 per tonne when the third phase is completed. 
“International commodity prices aren’t coming back to their normal levels until mid-2022 at least. But even after they normalise, our post-expansion coal will still be the cheapest source of energy at $27 per tonne,” said Mr Syed, noting that the mine’s output must be increased to 12.2m tonnes per annum for it to fully achieve the economic and financial viability. 
Focus on renewable energy
Mr Syed went to great pains to state that he and his company firmly believe in climate change and consider coal to be a dirty fuel source. But burning coal is unavoidable to meet the developing economy’s base-load power requirements, he insisted. 
However, renewable sources of energy should be promoted simultaneously, he said, noting that his company is now focusing more on wind and solar projects. 
Engro Energy is going to establish a 400MW wind and solar power project at Jhimpir to sell 20pc cheaper electricity to bulk consumers based in Port Qasim and Dhabeji under a business-to-business (B2B) model by 2024. 
In addition, the company has signed 17 letters of intent with the Balochistan government to set up 10 wind power and seven solar power plants of up to 1,700MW in Chagai district. 
“We’ve set up wind masts. They’ve been collecting [meteorological] data for two years now,” he said.

1,Sindh plans to start wheat procurement from March 15,Provincial govt's buying target expected to remain unchanged at 1.4m tonnes for upcoming season.,"HYDERABAD: Sindh’s food department plans to start procuring wheat from March 15 instead of its usual procurement exercise schedule that begins from the middle or by late April.  
“We have serious plans to start the procurement drive by March 15 instead of April in order to capitalise on the early harvesting trend in the Mirpurkhas zone of lower Sindh,” Haleem Shaikh, the provincial food secretary, told Dawn on Saturday. 
He agreed that starting the exercise in April affects procurement. The procurement target would remain unchanged at 1.4m tonnes for the upco­ming season as well, he said.  
Last year, the food department managed to buy 1.2m tonnes of wheat against the procurement target of 1.4m tonnes.  
The Sindh government fixed grain’s support price of Rs2,000 per 40kg last year, which has been raised to Rs2,200 this year. 

Provincial government’s buying target expected to remain unchanged at 1.4m tonnes for upcoming season

Sindh’s food department has also started releasing wheat from its godowns at Rs4,875 per 100kg bag. Around 350,000 wheat is to be released by December and the remaining stock by March.  
Last year, the Sindh government sought approval from the federal government for enhancing the cash credit limit (CCL) in view of an increase in the support price. The CCL of Rs130 billion last season was revised to Rs152bn in the outgoing season. It would be raised again in view of a higher support price of Rs2,200 this year. 
Food officials claimed that the provincial food department has to clear Rs152bn liabilities of banks besides a markup of 7.8pc over the principal amount. Wheat releases are under way and the department anticipates recovering Rs78bn until March. The food department would require Rs75bn if the new procurement target is fixed at 1.4m tonnes. A tonne of wheat would be procured for Rs55,000. 
Sindh Abadgar Board Vice President Mahmood Nawaz Shah pointed out that both federal and provincial governments should increase procurement targets for wheat for the coming year.  
In the last two years, the only price controlling measure of the government was releasing its stocks, he said, adding that when the government had lower stocks, the private sector increased the prices. “Instead of importing wheat, it should be purchased from local farmers,” he said.  
Meanwhile, wheat is being released at the rate of Rs48.75 per kg to chakkis (flour grinding units), which are selling flour at Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.  
“We incur Rs16.40 per kg overhead cost on the conversion flour from grain. It’s also inclusive of Rs2 per kg profit margin on our part,” said Haji Mohammad Memon of Atta Chakki Owners Associations. He lamented that the government was until recently releasing 220kg wheat daily per store, which has now been reduced to 170kg. 
As a result, wheat was purchased from the open market where 100kg bag was available at Rs6,000-Rs6,100 exclusive of overhead cost. “The administration wants us to sell flour at Rs60 per kilo which was clearly not affordable. We have urged the food secretary in a recent meeting to increase the daily release limit,” he said. 
Meanwhile, the World Food Programme (WFP) is assisting the Sindh government in a feasibility study for setting up silos in the province. The study would be completed next week and shared with the food department. Currently, the department has a storage capacity of around 700,000 tonnes of grain in godowns. 
WFP is likely to share the feasibility report on Monday with Sindh’s food secretary, reflecting the cost of a silos with a capacity of 10,000 tonnes.

2,Jittery week on PSX sees 881-point loss,KARACHI: The benchmark of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) lost 881 points or two per cent on a weekly basis to...,"KARACHI: The benchmark of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) lost 881 points or two per cent on a weekly basis to close at 43,233 points at the end of the last trading session. 
According to Arif Habib Ltd, trading on the stock market commenced on a positive note in the outgoing week owing to the fall in the international oil prices caused by the outbreak of a new Covid-19 variant, i.e. Omicron. 
Moreover, the approval of the Saudi fund of $3 billion and the expectation of its early receipt kept the investors’ sentiments high during the week. 
The government also paid Rs135bn as second instalment to independent power producers against their outstanding receivables, which further boosted the positive momentum. 
The Pakistan Stock Exchange was reclassified as a frontier market by MSCI, a global index provider, during the outgoing week — a development that analysts expected would bring in higher foreign inflows. 
However, trade numbers released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics for November posted a 94pc monthly jump in imports to $8bn. 
This took the trade deficit to an all-time high of $5.1bn, up three times on a month-on-month basis, causing a bloodbath on the stock exchange. 
This, along with a higher-than-anticipated inflation figure of 11.53pc, created panic in the market. 
As a result, the PSX witnessed the worst single-day fall in 20 months on Thursday, losing 2,135 points (or 4.71pc) by the close. 
In addition, the rupee depreciated to an all-time low of Rs176.77, which further fuelled the bearish sentiment. 
Sector-wise, negative contributions came from technology and communication (198 points), cement (165 points), oil and gas exploration (101 points), textile composite (68 points) and food and personal care (67 points). 
Sectors that contributed positively to the index were commercial banking (59 points) and oil and gas marketing (20 points). 
Scrip-wise, negative contributors were Lucky Cement Ltd (124 points), TRG Pakistan Ltd (107 points), Systems Ltd (65 points), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (62 points) and Pakistan Oilfields Ltd (44 points). Positive contributors to the index were Habib Bank Ltd (67 points), Pakistan State Oil Company Ltd (52 points) and United Bank Ltd (40 points). 
Foreign selling continued in the outgoing week and amounted to $62.8 million versus a net sell of $39.2m in the preceding week. Major selling came from commercial banks ($27.2m) and cement ($14.8m). 
On the local front, buying was reported by companies ($25.7m) and individuals ($16m). The average daily volume clocked in at 319m shares, up 21pc from a week ago. The average value traded settled at $90m, up 51pc from preceding week.

3,Textile exports projected to cross $20bn target,"In November alone, textile exports were up 36 per cent as compared to the same period last year.","LAHORE: With the ongoing $3.5 billion expansion plan for the textile industry, Pakistan’s textile exports are likely to increase by $6bn and cross the $20bn target projected for the fiscal year 2021-22.  
In November alone, textile exports were up 36 per cent as compared to the same period last year, data shared by the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) showed.  
“With the ongoing expansion plan, our exports are gradually rising and reflecting very positive signs for the industry. [Textile exports will] easily reach $21bn which is one billion more than the actual target of the $20bn set for FY22,” Aptma chairman Abdul Rahim Nasir told Dawn on Saturday. 
“The total investment and expansion plan for all sectors for FY22 is worth $4.5bn and includes $3.5bn for textile sector alone. Investments of $1.5bn have been made so far in the textile sector while the rest $2bn would be in place by June 30, 2022,” the Aptma chairman explained. Major investments and expansions have been made for value-addition including from semi-finished to finished goods, raw cloth to dyed cloth to garments for example, he maintained. 
“Since things are in the right directions at present, we will surely achieve our targets and even more this year subject to continuation of pro-exports’ policies,” the Aptma chairman believed.  
The association has termed textile growth in November and July to November, 2021 a good omen for the textile industry.  
“Alhamdulillah Textile entrepreneurs have honoured their commitment, with expansion plans well on track Textile exports are set to increase by 6 billion dollars this year compared to last year, thereby equivalent to the 3 year IMF Program,” the association said in a tweet on Saturday. 
According to data shared by Aptma, textile exports (silk, wool, cotton, vegetable textile fibres, man-made staple fibres, wadding, carpets, special woven fabrics, impregnated, coated textile fibres, knitted fabrics, apparel and other made-up textile articles etc) jumped to over $1.747bn (36pc) in November from over $1.286bn attained in the same period in 2020.  
Likewise, exports jumped to over $7.834bn from July to November 2021, posting a rise of 29pc from over $6.052 recorded in the same period last year. 
It may be mentioned that the textile & apparel sector had touched a figure of $15.380bn in FY21. The government, keeping in view the exports growth, projected $20bn target for FY22.  
Similarly, agri sector exports last year reached $4.341bn. For FY22, the target has been set at $4.858bn. Non-agri exports reached to $5.578bn last year and target for FY22 has been fixed at $6.357bn.  
Country’s total exports — including textile, agri and non-agri — remained at $25.300bn last year. The ongoing year’s target has been projected as $31.225bn subject to continuation of the ongoing enabling environment aiming at export-led sustainable growth.

4,National AI policy soon to secure digital banking: Amin,"“Digital transformation of Pakistan corresponds with cybersecurity,"" minister says.","KARACHI: Amid growing threat of cybersecurity and frequent hacking of data systems even of national institutions, the federal government has focused more on counter measures and after first-ever Cybersecurity Policy, it’s soon going to launch national artificial intelligence (AI) policy which the industry experts believe would help securing mainly the digital banking system.
The development was shared by Federal Minister for IT and Telecom Syed Aminul Haq while addressing a conference titled BlockChain at a local auditorium.
He was sure that the cybersecurity and excellence in AI had become crucial for the country’s smooth and strong economic system.
“Cybersecurity is the first important pillar of Digital Policy 2021 of IT Ministry,” he said. “Digital transformation of Pakistan corresponds with Cybersecurity. Pakistan’s first cybersecurity policy is approved by the federal cabinet this year. And now the government is fully committed to introducing national AI policy soon.”
He referred to recent attacks on the country’s banking systems and national institutions database which could not be compromised.
The minister’s thoughts came days after the cyberattack on the National Bank of Pakistan had almost paralysed digital and automated banking system.
Though the bank had claimed no data breach or financial loss due to the cyberattack, it took many weeks to restore the system.
Cybersecurity experts and AI professionals say if the government succeeds in bringing in and implementing the comprehensive policies in these two areas, the country’s banking industry and financial institutions would be among the key beneficiaries of the development.
Highlighting the importance of IT in economic development, he said that a leader is one who envisions future requirements of the nations. The IT ministry has been on the path of landmark steps to make Pakistan digital.
“The federal cabinet has already been made paperless by shifting work to tablets and android cell phones,” said the federal minister. “The governance of Parliament would also be made paperless by this government.” While bridging the gap between academia and industry, he stressed the need for close cooperation among academia, industry and the IT ministry in introducing emerging technologies in Pakistan.
He said the gap between academia and industry needs to narrow down and IT academicians must start supervising industrial projects through agreement between industries and universities.
Mr Haq expressed readiness of the IT ministry to work with industry and academia through trilateral agreement and bring up the recommendations of a committee on data protection, cybersecurity and collaborative modus operandi before the cabinet.
“Our ministry is committed to equip the 60 per cent of young population of Pakistan with IT expertise  by providing 3G and 4G services especially in the remotest areas which are far away from urban centres,” he added.
Apart from experts from  Pakistan, the conference also featured speakers from Europe, America and Middle East. They exchanged views and experiences on BlockChain technology.
Later, IR-Next  Chairman Dr Khalid thanked the federal minister for taking landmark initiatives in the IT sector. The conference ended with distribution of awards to IR-Next team.
IR-Next is a solution provider organisation  working on BlockChain, IOT and AI with public and private sector.

5,Imported tyre prices surge 25pc in a year,Further hike in duty likely to boost smuggling.,"KARACHI:   The prices of imported tyres have risen by an average 25 per cent from  January till to date owing to massive rupee devaluation, imposition of regulatory duty (RD) and an increase  in import trade price.
Importers are worried  over the reports regarding further increase in RD and additional customs duty on luxury items, which include tyres, to compress demand  and reduce the country’s ballooning trade deficit.
Pakistan Tyre Importers and Dealers Association (PTIDA) chairman Ashraf Dharani  said the government believes that the tyres are luxury items but all  over the world they fall in the category of essential items of daily  use. 
A random market  survey revealed that Chinese tyres (175/70R13 and 185/65R14) now  cost Rs7,000 and Rs8,500 as compared to Rs5,500 and Rs6,500 in January. Dunlop  tyres (175/70R13 and 185/65R14) are now available at Rs8,950 and  Rs10,750 as against Rs7,350 and Rs9,275.
As a result, the rates of second-hand  tyres (without any puncture spots) have also risen sharply. A dealer at New M.A.  Jinnah Road told Dawn that a set of four used Bridgestone or Good Year tyres  (155/65/13) is now priced at Rs15,000 against Rs8,000-9,000 in  January.

Further hike in duty likely to boost smuggling

Bridgestone (175/70R13 and 185/65R14) are selling at Rs10,500 and Rs13,150 as compared to Rs8,100 and Rs10,700.
The prices of locally manufactured tyres witnessed 8 to 11 per cent rise in the last one year.
Protecting local industry
The chairman further said the government has been  highly supportive of the local industry which caters to only  23pc of the overall demand. He added that the imposition of RD historically had only promoted parallel  economy.
Mr Dharani said market people have not passed  on the full impact of the hike in the prices of imported tyres to the consumers. As  a result of high incidence of duties and other factors, smuggled tyres  still hold a sizable market share in an annual market demand of 10  million tyres, he said.
“Any increase in RD would bring tyre prices under further pressure and would give cushion to the smugglers to improve their market share,” he feared.
He said the annual  demand for passenger cars is 4.85m tyres in which imports stand at  2.59m and the local industry produces 1.119m tyres. The rest is met through smuggled tyres.
Truck/bus  tyres (radial and non-radial) demand is around 4m tyres while annual  import is 1.4m and shortfall of 2.6m (radial 2.2m and around 400,000  non-radial tyres) is met through smuggling. There is no local industry  for radial tyre manufacturing so far while 25,000 non-radial tyres are  produced every year.
The annual demand for light truck tyres  (radial and non-radial) is 4.5m tyres while annual imports are  estimated at 1.44m tyres and the local industry makes 560,000 tyres. The rest of market demand is fulfilled through smuggling.
He  said after an increase of 10pc in budget FY22, the current rate  of RD on truck/bus tyre is 25pc while for light truck  and car tyres it is 20pc.
In a nutshell, the total annual demand  (barring bikes) is over 12.65m in which 5.5m tyres come through  smuggling, he said.
The PTIDA chief claimed that smuggled  car, light truck and bus/truck tyres are approximately 25-35pc cheaper  than legally imported tyres.
He said that a delegation of PTIDA  had met Commerce Adviser Abdul  Razak Dawood ahead of budget FY22 and proposed reduction in RD on import of tyres but on the  contrary the government increased RD to safeguard the  local industry. “As a result, a large volume of legal trade has shifted  to smuggling,” he deplored.
