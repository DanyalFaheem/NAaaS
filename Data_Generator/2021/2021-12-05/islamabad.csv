ISLAMABAD: Real estate developers and builders have criticised the recent property valuation by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and threatened to hold protests at Faizabad and Islamabad Expressway against it on Dec 10.
The Federation of Realtors Pakistan and the Islamabad Estate Agents Association president, Sardar Tahir Mehmood, said it seemed the FBR was bent upon abolishing the construction package announced by the government.
Addressing a press conference at the National Press Club, he said the tax collecting body was causing financial damage to the real estate sector.
“These rates have been revised without consulting the stakeholders, which is totally unrealistic. The rates have been revised by non-professional FBR officers who are not aware of ground realities,” Mr Mehmood said.

Reject FBR’s new property valuation, say board bent upon abolishing govt’s construction package

He added that this was a conspiracy to thwart the vision of the prime minister to boost the construction industry.
Other speakers at the news conference said the book value of property rates in Islamabad had been jacked manifolds only in Islamabad, making it difficult for the buyers to register new property in their names.
There was more than 283 per cent increase in the property rates for F-7 sector against the 2019 property valuation while more than 164pc increase has been made for E-7 and over 163pc for E-11 etc.
Chairman of the association Musarat Ijaz said there were incompetent people in FBR who did not even know the basics of real estate business and its valuation.
“Now they want to teach us?” he said, adding when the book value of property was raised in 2019, the FBR team sat down with the stakeholders and made a consensus decision.
“If the government did not take the decision back, there will be a nationwide protest on Dec 10,” he added.
The members announced that they will not only bring around 2,000 people for a sit-in at Faizabad but the real estate consultants will also block the expressway along with Srinagar Highway.
General Secretary of the association Ahsan Malik said the real estate sector consisted of many subsectors, including consultants, commission agents, builders, developers and even material suppliers.
“This new value table has created a serious business crisis for all the stakeholders and the FBR must withdraw its SRO immediately as all the property businesses and transfers have been put on hold due to it,” Mr Malik added.
Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) President Shakeel Munir and others later held a protest demonstration against the new valuation outside the press club.

3,Crops’ inspection launched to correct land revenue record,RAWALPINDI: The district administration will complete the digital Girdawari (crop inspection) in Rawalpindi district...,"RAWALPINDI: The district administration will complete the digital Girdawari (crop inspection) in Rawalpindi district by Dec 15 to correct the land revenue record.
Besides, the procedure would also help check the real position of rural land, crops and structures in villages and avoid land grabbing cases.
A senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the digital Girdawari was being carried out for the first time in the province and so far more than 10 million mutation of property documents had been computerised through digital application.
He said digital Girdawari of 788 out of 1,058 villages in Rawalpindi district had been completed.
He said as per land revenue act, Girdawari was conducted twice in a year but due to change in Patwari system, it had not been carried out for the last few years.
He said during the Girdawari survey of the rural areas, the land revenue officials check the status of land, its crop production and how many tubewells had been installed. The survey also determines whether the land was used for commercial purposes.
He said in the absence of digital record, people had to face problems, specially during the distribution of land among legal heirs after the death of the owner, with the Patwari playing a crucial role.
When contacted, Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Ali said a regular mobile application had been launched for digital Girdawari, which had been started on the direction of the Board of Revenue and was a result of special efforts of senior member revenue Babar Hayat Tarar.
He said they faced problems to get GPS location and picture on spot in Murree area where mobile phone signals dropped frequently. “But, we managed the things,” he added.
Mr Ali said it would eliminate corruption from the land revenue department and transparency would come in the registration and implementation of records of the land revenue department.
He said under the new system, pictures were being taken on the spot.
With this move, he said tampering with records would become practically impossible.
He said most of the work in Rawalpindi district had been completed by Nov 24.
He said the district gazetteer was also being published to collect updated and concise information of all tehsils, adding that mobile centres had been established for the provision of revenue services to the people of far-flung areas on the directives of Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar.
After completing the survey, the deputy commissioner said the revenue court case management system would provide speedy justice, he said.
“Previously, the deputy commissioner would receive a complaint about land related issues and refer it to revenue officials (Patwari) and would seek a report about the land status and on the basis of the Patwari’s report he would take a decision. But the digitalisation has made things easier for deputy commissioner tocheck the record and decide the cases without any delay and involvement of patwari,” the deputy commissioner said.

4,Govt’s ‘rejection’ of AGP report on Covid-19 spending termed unrealistic,"Politicians say govt cannot turn down any audit report; PPP, PML-N likely to take up matter in next PAC meeting.","ISLAMABAD: The PTI-led government is possibly the first in history to have openly rejected a report of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) — a constitutional body established for the public oversight of government expenditures.
However, despite strong rhetoric from Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry that the government had rejected the audit report related to the public sector expenditures on Covid-19, the report continues to be the top item on the website of the finance ministry.
A senior official of the AGP office said it was probably for the first time that any government had rejected an audit report. It is unrealistic as audits are conducted in coordination with the relevant departments, he added.
Mr Chaudhry has said the finance ministry had already rejected the audit report showing irregularities worth over Rs150 billion in various public sector organisations, including Ehsaas programme, utility stores, defence services, health sector and the interior ministry.

Politicians say govt cannot turn down any audit report; PPP, PML-N likely to take up matter in next PAC meeting

A spokesman for the government did not respond to the query related to the jurisdiction of the federal cabinet over the AGP that is a constitutional body and its report is presented to the president, not the prime minister.
Even politicians have turned down the claim of the government that the cabinet could reject an audit report of the AGP.
“No, their assertion is incorrect; they cannot reject the AGP report,” said MNA Khawaja Mohammad Asif of the PML-N, who is also member of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC).
He said the audit findings can only be contested within the relevant department and in the PAC of parliament.
The ‘Audit report on expenditure incurred on Covid-19 by federal government’ is placed as the top item on the website of the finance ministry because it has been made public as a key conditionality of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
To ensure that Pakistan was conducting the audit of expenditures made in relation to Covid-19, an IMF team held two meetings with officials of the AGP led by Maqbool Gondal, deputy auditor general.
The last meeting was held in the AG office when Esther Perez Ruiz, the IMF resident representative, visited AGP Mohammad Ajmal Gondal to ensure that the audit condition had been met.
AGP spokesman Tafakhar Ali Asadi said each year the annual audit reports were presented to the president on Feb 28. Due to the extraordinary situation, special audits related to Covid -19 were conducted in almost all countries.
“The AG office was already in the audit process when the negotiations started with IMF and they demanded to see the progress which was shared with the IMF in the presence of senior officers of the Finance Ministry,” Mr Asadi said.
During routine years, after consent from the head of the state, the annual audit reports are submitted to the National Assembly, and the PAC is responsible to amend or delete clauses from the reports.
The current PAC consists of 29 parliamentarians belonging to almost all the parties. It includes 23 MNAs and six senators.
While an audit report is confidential and a classified document as long as it is not presented in parliament, this time the special audit report about Covid-19 expenditures was placed on the website of the finance ministry due to the demand by the IMF to ensure transparency.
The office of the AGP has been established under Article 169 of the Constitution. But existed since the 19th century when the financial codes and manuals for public financial management in the region were first drafted.
During the British era, it was the Controller General of India and part of it later became the Controller General of Pakistan.
Therefore, to ensure the public oversight of the government spending the first PAC of Pakistan was constituted on May 20, 1948, but it could not function due to various reasons.
Even the budget of the auditor general is classified as “charged” expenditure which can only be discussed in the parliament but cannot be altered.
Senior PAC member Syed Naveed Qamar even said the government does not seem to believe in the Constitution.
“They use to make politically motivated statements over every issue and despite the rejection by the cabinet, the Covid-19 audit report will remain valid and will be taken up by the PAC today or tomorrow,” he added.
Meanwhile, both the PPP and the PML-N are likely to take up the cabinet decision of rejecting the audit report in the next PAC meeting.

5,HR body seeks speedy justice in Sialkot tragedy,Says it is following the progress in investigating the case with all concerned departments.,"ISLAMABAD: Condemning the lynching of Sri Lankan factory manager Nanadasi Priyanth Kumara in Sialkot, the National Commission on Human Rights (NCHR) on Saturday demanded speedy and impartial inquiry of the incident.
“We, at the commission, are deeply perturbed by the brutal mob violence and blatant violation of human rights, especially against a guest in our country. It is unfortunate that the commission is issuing its very first introduction statement over such a horrific incident that has shaken the whole nation. We believe that no civilised country can allow such an act, and the state should take the strictest possible measures to ensure speedy justice,” the statutory body said.
“At this time of grief, NCHR would like to ensure that the commission stood with the aggrieved family of Nanadasi Priyanth Kumara and demanded an impartial, in-depth and speedy probe of the incident, the late response of the police and lack of security.”
NCHR said it was following the progress being made in investigating the case with all concerned departments. In a letter written to Chief Minister Punjab Sardar Usman Buzdar, the NCHR has demanded a high-power investigation committee and exemplary punishment to the perpetrators to prevent such an incident from occurring in the future.
The commission also called for strategic measures to address increasing extremism and systemic rise of mob violence and urged religious leaders and scholars, social activists, community leaders and political parties to play their role in tackling any kind of extremism in society.
NCHR Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha said: “At the onset my heart goes out to the family of Nanadasi Priyanth Kumara. In one’s worst nightmare, one cannot possibly imagine what it must feel like to see the person you love tortured, violated and killed in the most inhuman way possible.”
She said the Sialkot incident should be a wake-up call to reassess the direction that the youth of Pakistan were heading towards.
“It is not about religion but the growth of violent extremism, defiance of law and ignorance. We have suffocated the soft power of art, music and culture. Social and cultural norms that celebrate power and resolutions of conflicts through violence will find release through child abuse, gender violence and mob madness such as this,” she said.
NCHR is a statuary body set up to monitor, create awareness and protect the universal value of human rights, promote humanitarian culture and curb violations of human rights without discrimination.

6,PPP leader voices concern over growing circular debt,ISLAMABAD: PPP Vice-president Senator Sherry Rehman on Saturday expressed her concerns over the growing circular ...,"ISLAMABAD: PPP Vice-president Senator Sherry Rehman on Saturday expressed her concerns over the growing circular debt despite repeated increases in power tariff by the government.
In a statement here on Saturday, the PPP senator, criticising the government’s economic policies, regretted that the circular debt in the power sector had now reached Rs2,419 billion.
Ms Rehman, who is also the parliamentary leader of the party in the upper house of the parliament, said in June, the circular debt was Rs2,280 billion, which had increased by Rs139 billion in just four months.
Ms Rehman regretted that there had been an increase of over Rs34 billion each month. She recalled that when the present “selected government” had come into power in August 2018, the circular debt was Rs1,148 billion which showed that the circular debt had increased by 110pc in since the present “incompetent” regime took the control.
On the other hand, she said, the present government had already increased power tariff up to 52 per cent. She said the PTI in its election manifesto had declared that it would end the circular debt after coming into power. She said it took only three years to the government to get exposed before the nation.
Ms Rehman also expressed her concerns over the reports that the government was planning to present Rs600 billion mini-budget to meet the conditionalities of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). She feared that there would be further increased in unemployment and inflation in the country after the announcement of adjustments, withdrawal in tax exemptions and curtailment in the expenditure by the government through a mini-budget.
“Why is Pakistan being run on IMF’s dictation?” she asked, adding that instead of making a Madina-like state, Pakistan was being made a colony of the IMF.
Calling it another U-turn of the government, she said the mini-budget would further add to the miseries of the people of Pakistan and would bring another tsunami of price-hike.

RAC Director Waqar Ahmed said Qawwali became the style of the preaching of Sufis in the subcontinent from where it was introduced to the whole world.
Naheed Manzoor said in order to spread Islam in the Indian subcontinent, Sufis chose music from the colours of local art and culture and gave it a new name.
She said by using subtle phrases like Qawwali, the Sufis attracted non-Muslims and conveyed the message of Islam to them.

10,Homicide unit of capital police disbanded,"Set up in 2016, it failed to produce desired results, say police officers","ISLAMABAD: The homicide unit of the capital police has been disbanded due to its failure to achieve desired results.
Senior police officers told Dawn on condition of anonymity that the unit was established in September 2016 on the pattern of the Punjab police where it was introduced in 2014. The unit was created under the investigation wing to solely probe murder cases by using modern techniques.
Teams, each comprising an inspector, a sub-inspector, an assistant sub-inspector and three constables, were given to circles each consisting of two police stations.
In 2019, the Punjab police also abolished its homicide unit due to its failure, said the officers.

Set up in 2016, it failed to produce desired results, say police officers

Over 30 police officials who were working in the unit have been transferred to Rescue-15.
The officers said there were a number of complaints against officials of the unit, including for faulty investigation and misconduct.
There were also complaints about deliberate delay in initiating investigations and taking unnecessary time to complete the challan for submission, the officers said.
Besides, there was also lack of supervision and ownership from the station house officers (SHO), subdivisional police officers (SDPOs) and superintendents of police.
As per the law, the SHOs have the power to investigate a case or appoint someone on their behalf for it. Besides, the SHOs under section 173 of CrPC can make the challan of a case and submit it to the SDPO.
The SDPO refers the challan to the concerned SP who with a covering letter sends it to the police prosecution department, the officers said. But on a number of occasions the three officers disowned the challans and seemed reluctant to submit it.
The homicide unit worked under the SSP investigation and there was no post or office of the SSP investigation in Police Rules 1861 under which the capital police are still working. The SHOs, SDPOs and the SPs work under the SSP operations.
Besides, the investigation wing of the police also failed to supervise the unit properly and get the desired results and address the grievances of complainants, the officers said.
Talking to Dawn, some officials of the unit said the cost of the investigation of a murder case was over Rs100,000.
The amount was either paid by the complainant or the investigators from their own pockets or other resources, they added.
There are also different analyses and examinations, including DNA and chemical tests.
Lack of funds resulted in faulty investigations and delays, they added.
The senior officers said the issues were brought in the knowledge of the police chief but in vain.
An amount of Rs10 million was reserved as the investigation cost in the police budget but the police owed Rs1.13 million to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA).
When contacted, Deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations) Afzal Ahmed Kausar confirmed that the homicide unit had been disbanded over its failure to produce satisfactory results. Besides, there were complaints against it and lack of supervision among the concerned senior officers, he added.
