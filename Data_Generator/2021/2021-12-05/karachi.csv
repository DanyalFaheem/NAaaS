0,Two KMC officials suspended for ‘sexually harassing’ woman,"A Gujjar Nullah resident alleges they asked for bribes, favours for sparing her house from demolition.","KARACHI: Two senior officials of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation have been placed under suspension for their alleged involvement in harassing, sending inappropriate messages and asking for carnal favours from a woman whose house is to be demolished during an ongoing Supreme Court-mandated anti-encroachment operation at Gujjar Nullah, it emerged on Saturday.
The two BS-17 council employees — deputy directors of Katchi Abadis and anti-encroachment departments — were directed to report to the human resource management department of the KMC with immediate effect after Karachi Administrator Barrister Murtaza Wahab suspended them and formed a committee to conduct an inquiry into the matter.
Sources told Dawn that the action against the two officers were initiated after a woman accused them on social media of bribery and harassment for sparing her house that was marked for demolition during the ongoing anti-encroachment operation.
They said that the municipal administration had gotten the video clip of the affected woman and audio clips containing her conversation with the two officials.

A Gujjar Nullah resident alleges they asked for bribe, favours for sparing her house from demolition

The clip showed woman saying that the two officials had initially demanded Rs100,000 for not razing her house during the anti-encroachment action, but she could give them only Rs25,000 due to her financial constraints.
“Next day they demolished our house,” she said, adding that the officials asked her to either pay the full amount or enter into a relationship.
She further alleged that the KMC officials blackmailed her and threatened her that they would implicate her brother in a criminal case if she did not fulfil their inappropriate demands. “They also asked me to send them my photographs,” she added.
The clip showed the woman saying that the two officers had done the same indecent things with several other female victims of the anti-encroachment operation at Gujjar Nullah, but they (affected women) opted to remain silent due to threats given by the KMC officers and out of fear of consequences.
The administrator, who is also the provincial government spokesman and CM’s adviser on law, while taking notice of the alleged bribery and harassment by the officials of the anti-encroachment and katchi abadi departments, said that he would not tolerate such indecent acts.
Talking to Dawn, he said that a committee had been set up to look into the matter and it would conduct a thorough and impartial inquiry into the matter.
He said that further legal action would be taken against the officers involved after the inquiry. “The matter will be investigated transparently without giving any political colour,” he added.

2,Murad Saeed accuses PPP govt of embezzling NFC funds,"""The PPP government has spent all NFC funds on corruption and the personal wealth of its leaders,"" he says.","KARACHI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led federal government on Saturday accused the Pakistan Peoples Party government in Sindh of misappropriation of funds provided under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award during the past many years calling the provincial administration as “the most corrupt” in the country’s history.
The fresh claim of the centre came from a key member of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s team, who vowed that Islamabad would no longer leave the people of Sindh at the mercy of “corrupt PPP”.
“They [PPP leaders] will always complain about funds and make hue and cry against the federal government,” Communication and Postal Services Minister Murad Saeed told a press conference here.
Accompanied by Leader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh, he added: “But whenever we ask them about spending of funds and what development work they had carried out with trillions of rupees during the past 13 years, they stage a boycott in the National Assembly. The PPP government has spent all NFC funds on corruption and personal wealth of the leaders.”
He said the PPP government had used 18th Amendment as a “tool of corruption” and always tried to hide its failure in the name of democracy.
The federal minister claimed that Prime Minister Khan had made a commitment with the people of Sindh that he would not disappoint them.
“So whatever the legal capacity the federal government has, we will keep playing our role for the people of Sindh,” said Mr Saeed.
“No one cares if you [PPP government] don’t like this. But, you will be questioned ... your illegal moves will be resisted and the federal government will keep doing development works in the province whether you like it or not,” he said.
Referring to the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021, he called it a “dictatorial law” and true reflection of “feudal mindset” of the PPP leadership.

5,‘Social distancing becomes an inaccessible privilege for urban poor during pandemic’,"KARACHI: Many architects, planners, academics, researchers and students of diverse backgrounds enriched discussions...","KARACHI: Many architects, planners, academics, researchers and students of diverse backgrounds enriched discussions through their respective insights during the two-day fifth international Conference on Urban and Regional Planning (CURP) on ‘Perspectives on Pandemic: Impact on Urban Pedagogies, Research and Practices’.
The event was organised by the Department of Architecture and Planning (DAP) at the NED University of Engineering and Technology, which concluded here on Saturday.
Senior researcher and director of collective for social science and research Haris Gazdar in his speech said knowledge can be atomised in its known, unknown and knowable forms. “By the same token, knowledge and its agency need to be understood through the lens of the pandemic,” he said.
He mentioned that there is broad data about mortality and recovery available now but certain contextual data and the methods of interpretation need to be improved.
He emphasised there is a need for epidemiological data along with geospatial data to invest in the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic.
Chief Executive of the Hands NGO Dr Sheikh Tanveer said that we cannot deal with future pandemics without strengthening the health system.
The dean of NED University, Dr Noman Ahmad, shared his observations that how education was managed during the pandemic days.
“The education system was transformed but to the advantage of affluent. Meanwhile, low-income groups got excluded,” he said, adding that there is also a need to study how spaces were modified to cope with the pandemic. He appreciated the fact about how the three tiers of the government — the federal, provincial and local government — united to fight the pandemic. “The same unity needs to be demonstrated on other issues of national interest,” he said.
American scholar of architectural history and urban development Dr Jonathan Calame talked about how architects could be essential to health care workers.
A technical session was marked by the paper titled ‘Pandemic as an opportunity to re-prioritise equitable urban design planning and policy’ by architect Aamina Shahid, who is development planner and academic at Comsats. The researcher was of the opinion that the Covid-19 pandemic has had damaging repercussions on marginalised communities and neighbourhoods the world over.
Another paper by Adam Abdullah, Soha Macktoom and Aqdus Fatima focused on the ‘Intersection of heat and densities in the post-pandemic urbans of the global south’.
Another paper titled ‘Pre-requisites, opportunities and pitfalls of online studios’, by Fazal Noor an architect, urban planner and academic at Sir Syed University of Engineering and Technology, spoke about online studios started in the wake of the spread of the pandemic.
A paper titled ‘An evaluation of online design studios, strength and weakness of architectural education in Bangladesh during Covid 19’ by Dr Mohmmad Faruk and Shayeeka Binte Alam, academics from the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC), threw light on the challenges of architectural education in the days of the pandemic as interaction is the prime method of students of architecture.

He said the “disclosure” meant that Pakistan’s all assets now stood mortgaged against the single loan.
Speaking to the media here on Saturday, Mr Shah pointed out that the horrifying revelation had come from a sitting governor and not from any opposition party.
He said the Supreme Court should summon Mr Tareen and seek detail of the deal with IMF.
The PPP leader said that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf was in fact not acquiring loan but putting the country’s all assets at stake.
In reply to a question, Khursheed Shah condemned the Sialkot incident where a Sri Lankan national was subjected to barbarism and lynched by a mob of religious fanatics. He said he was shocked to hear that the mob took law into their own hands and after killing the victim torched his body.

She said a master plan for cities should be designed after giving serious consideration to issues of drinking water supply, sewerage disposal, drainage, education and health facilities.
The minister was speaking at a seminar organised by the planning and development department in Shaheed Benazirabad district on Saturday on the subject of urban policy and strategic planning for master plan-2037 for cities like Nawabshah, Naushahro Feroze and Sanghar.
She said that sustainable planning should be done before preparing any master plan after assessing the existing civic amenities. She said complete surveys should be conducted in this regard.
She observed that serious attention should be given to urban forest and solar energy in order to make environment-friendly master plans. She said recreation and sports facilities should also be kept in view.
Dr Pechuho asked the P&D department to seek proposals from stakeholders of the three cities and said seminars should also be organised in these cities.
P&D urban directorate’s director general Mohammad Ali Khoso gave the minister a briefing about master plans. He said that by the year 2050, 60pc population would be found settled in cities, according to a global survey, and added that cities contributed 80pc of economic activities and they were considered economic hub as well.

10,Abrupt shifting of Mirpurkhas Civil Hospital opposed,"MIRPURKHAS: Representatives of various political and religious parties, nationalist groups and civil society...","MIRPURKHAS: Representatives of various political and religious parties, nationalist groups and civil society organisations attended a conference organised by the All City Tajir Ittehad here on late Friday evening to discuss the situation arising out of the abrupt shifting of emergency and other wards of the Mirpurkhas Civil Hospital to an under-construction building away from the city.
The conference was chaired by president of the traders’ alliance Kamran Memon. Faqeer Mohammad, A.R. Memon, Maulana Hafeezur Rehman Faiz, Advocate Khurram and others spoke at the event held in Malik Hall.
A resolution adopted at the conference strongly demanded that no ward at the hospital’s present building be closed or shifted until proper treatment facilities were put in place at the new place. It argued that thousands of patients were deprived of emergency, OPD and other essentially required health facilities due to the abrupt closure of wards at the existing building.
The participants noted that the hospital catered to the healthcare needs of a large number of people living within Mirpurkhas and many towns and villages in the district.
Kamran Memon deplored that the closure and shifting process had been started in a hurry for unknown reasons. Patients, mostly accompanying their attendants, are turned away when they arrive at the civil hospital only to be told that treatment facilities were no more available there. They are advised to proceed to the new building, located some five kilometres away from the present site.
Mr Memon also noted that no handover/takeover of the new building had taken place. The construction work was also yet to be completed at the new site, which had until now been serving as the Mirpurkhas District Headquarter Hospital, he said.
Some speakers apprehended that vested interests backed by influential political and other figures might be instrumental in getting the civil hospital building vacated at the earliest with a view to occupy it or buy the property at a throwaway price. They suspected that such elements were planning to build a shopping mall or some other commercial concern at the ideally located site for construction of commercial buildings and business centers to earn huge money.
They claimed that the staff of the civil hospital was unwilling to move to the new site but the administration was forcing them to abide by the health department’s order or face disciplinary action.
The conference noted that proper infrastructure, transport means and streetlights were also not available along the routes of the new hospital site which would cause more hardship to patients, attendants and other visitors, besides employees.
It urged the governor, chief minister and judiciary to take notice of the issue and appropriate action in this regard.
