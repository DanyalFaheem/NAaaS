• Body sent to Lahore; wife seeks justice
• Lankan PM says his country confident those involved will be brought to justice    
NAROWAL: A first information report (FIR) has been registered against 900 workers of a garment factory in Sialkot for killing their Sri Lankan-national general manager and burning his body.  
The Sialkot police arrested 235 people, including those who tortured Priyantha Kumara and recorded videos.  
Hundreds of people, including the factory workers, protested against alleged blasphemy by Mr Kumara on Friday, tortured him to death and later burnt his body.  
The FIR was registered against 900 workers of Rajco Industries on the application of Uggoki Station House Officer (SHO) Armaghan Maqt under sections 302, 297, 201, 427, 431, 157, 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code and 7 and 11WW of the Anti-Terrorism Act. The applicant admitted that the protesters had slapped, kicked, punched and hit Mr Kumara with sticks in his presence, and dragged him out of the factory on Wazirabad Road where he died. They then set the body on fire. The SHO said he was helpless in front of the mob owing to shortage of personnel.  
Meanwhile, Sialkot police are conducting raids in the city, adjoining villages as well as in Sambrial, Daska and Pasrur tehsils to arrest the booked 900 suspects. Police are trying to identify the culprits through CCTV footage from the factory cameras as well as video clips that have gone viral on social media.

The 230 arrested include two main suspects, Mohammad Talha and Farhan Idrees, and all of them have been shifted to an undisclosed location. Rajco Industries remained closed on Saturday, and its workers were on the run to evade arrest.  
Mr Kumara’s post-mortem was completed at Allama Iqbal Teaching Hospital in Sialkot according to which most of his body was burnt and several bones were broken due to the torture he suffered, said hospital sources.  
Sialkot Deputy Commissioner Tahir Farooq said Mr Kumara’s body had been transported to a Lahore hospital in a Rescue 1122 ambulance amid tight security. After fulfilling formalities, it would be sent to Colombo.  
PML-N MNA from Sialkot Khwaja Asif visited the garment factory on Saturday and inquired about the incident. He expressed grief over Mr Kumara’s killing. Local businessmen also hung pictures of Mr Kumara outside the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry and laid garlands on it.

Quoting unidentified police sources, Geo TV said some factory workers disliked the deceased general manager, a textile engineer, for being strict in enforcing discipline. After a routine inspection on Friday morning, Mr Kumara had snubbed the sanitary staff over poor work. The channel further reported that as the factory was about to undergo a whitewash, the manager started removing posters from walls. As one of the posters was an invitation to a religious moot, some workers objected to it.  
The channel’s sources said Mr Kumara offered an apology, but a supervisor instigated the workers, who attacked him. Mr Kumara ran to the roof and tried to hide under solar panels, but the enraged workers got hold of him and killed him there and then.  
Mr Kumara’s grieving wife, Niroshi Dasaniyake, has pleaded with both Pakistani and Sri Lankan leaders for justice for her slain husband.  
“My husband was an innocent man. I found out from the news that after working abroad for so long he had been brutally murdered. I saw on the internet how inhuman the killing was. I appeal to the Sri Lankan president and the Pakistani prime minister and president to conduct a fair investigation so my husband and our two children get justice,” she said while speaking to BBC Sinhala.  
Meanwhile, Sri Lankan news website, Newswire, quoted Colombo’s High Commissioner in Pakistan Vice Admiral Mohan Wijewickrama as saying that arrangements were being made to transport the remains of Mr Kumara from Lahore to Colombo on a special flight on Monday.  
A preliminary report on the lynching was presented to Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar. The CM called for arresting the remaining suspects soon, directing the investigation report be completed soon and presented in court. Mr Buzdar vowed the culprits would not escape punishment as he was personally monitoring the progress.  
Special Assistant to Punjab CM on Information Hasaan Khawar on Saturday said 118 people had been arrested, including 13 primary suspects, in over 200 raids. Prime Minister Imran Khan and Chief Minister Buzdar were personally monitoring the case and strict punishment would be meted out to all those involved in this brutality, he said in a joint press conference with the Punjab inspector general of police (IGP) at the Directorate General Public Relations in Lahore.  
Mr Khawar said no one was allowed to take law into their hands. A departmental inquiry was also being conducted to determine how much time police took to reach the spot after receiving the first call, and strict action would be taken in case of any delay or negligence, he added.  
IGP Rao Sardar Ali Khan said police took prompt action and arrested the 13 primary suspects in less than 24 hours. More than 12 hours of footage from 160 CCTV cameras and mobile data analyses of the people present on the spot had also been examined. Talking about the time police took to respond, he said they received the first call at 11:28am and at 11:45am the Uggoki SHO along with his team reached the spot.  
By the time the force reached, Mr Kumara had been murdered, he said, adding that on being informed of the incident, the Sialkot district police chief and senior superintendent of police along with a heavy contingent rushed to the crime scene and brought law and order situation under control.   
IGP Khan further said the Counter-Terrorism Department, Special Branch and senior officers concerned partook in the operation and a team of senior officers was investigating all aspects of the incident.  
Responding to a question, the IGP said the suspects would be tried in the anti-terrorism court and the police would soon complete the investigation and present the suspects in court to punish them as soon as possible.  
At a press conference on Saturday in Lahore, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi condemned the incident and said the premier was monitoring the investigation into the case. PM Khan had given 48 hours to the investigating agencies to bring forth the facts, he said while answering a question.  
He said the Sri Lankan High Commission and foreign secretary had been updated on every detail of the case and they appreciated Pakistan’s prompt response. He stressed that the culprits would be brought to book. “The lynching of a Sri Lankan citizen will not affect Pakistan-Sri Lanka bilateral relations as it was a work of a group of people and the nation or the country cannot be blamed for it,” he added.  
The FM said Islamabad had also contacted the family of the deceased and would fulfil their wishes.  
Mr Qureshi also tweeted that he spoke to his Lankan counterpart and offered condolences. “Spoke to my brother FM Gamini Lakshman Peiris of #SriLanka and expressed my deep grief and condolences.”  

 



 
FM Qureshi added that Pakistan would ensure the perpetrators were punished. “The political leadership & Pakistani nation strongly condemn killing of a Sri Lankan national. We offer our sincere condolences to bereaved family, govt & people of #SriLanka & will ensure perpetrators are brought to justice. Such acts have no place in our faith & country,” he said in the tweet.  
Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan also spoke to Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and conveyed the nation’s anger and shame to the people of Sri Lanka over the vigilante killing of Kumara in Sialkot.  
In a tweet, he wrote: “Spoke to Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa today in UAE to convey our nation’s anger & shame to people of Sri Lanka at vigilante killing of Priyantha Diyawadana in Sialkot. I informed him 100+ ppl arrested & assured him they would be prosecuted with full severity of the law.”  

 



 
The Sri Lankan president also tweeted that his country trusted that the Pakistan government and PM would ensure justice in the case. “Deeply concerned by the incident in Sialkot #Pakistan. #SriLanka trusts that PM @ImranKhanPTI and the Gvt. of Pakistan will ensure justice is served and ensure the safety of the remaining Sri Lankan workers in Pakistan,” he wrote.  

 



 
Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa tweeted that his country was confident his Pakistani counterpart will fulfil his commitment to bring those involved to justice. “Shocking to see the brutal and fatal attack on Priyantha Diyawadana by extremist mobs in #Pakistan. My heart goes out to his wife and family. #SriLanka and her people are confident that PM @ImranKhanPTI will keep to his commitment to bring all those involved to justice,” he tweeted.  

 



 
Chief of his own faction of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, while condemning the “shameful” incident called for a thorough investigation, but in the same breath said such attacks would happen if the state did not act against those suspected of committing blasphemy. “In the past, such reactions have come when those accused of blasphemy have been sent abroad under government supervision,” he said in an indirect reference to Asia Bibi.  
Former chairman of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, Mufti Muneebur Rehman, also condemned the incident but called on the media to desist from blaming any group or individual before completion of the investigation into the matter.  
In a statement, he said there were no grounds to take the law into one’s hands when a constitutional and legal system existed in the country despite all the shortcomings it may have.  
“Anarchy and lawlessness spread in society, which are not in any way beneficial for the country, and a negative image of the country is created on the international level,” the statement quoted him as saying.

1,CJP says Covid key reason for pendency of cases,"Says courts will continue to pass judgements independently, wrong to presume that there is a bias in the judiciary.","LAHORE: Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Gulzar Ahmad has said the courts are, and will, remain independent as judges are supposed to uphold the rule of law and protect fundamental rights.  
Speaking at a function hosted by the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC) on Satur­day, Justice Ahmad said: “The courts will continue to pass judgements independently.”  
The chief justice said it was wrong to presume that there was bias in the judiciary.  
“The courts do not follow trends or seasons, but a decision is made on the basis of facts of a case,” he said.  
Referring to incidents of misconduct in courts, he advised the lawyers not to turn adverse decisions into the reasons for quarreling with judges. The bar and the bench were part and parcel of the same justice system, he added.  
“An advocate is supposed to be a person of reasoning and a person of law,” he said. The lawyers were also supposed to be well versed in the manners of appearance before courts.  
He pointed out that the canons of professional etiquette were part of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Council Act 1973 and asked whether the lawyers had forgotten those canons.  
The chief justice said the bar council needed to make the lawyers understand these canons at the time of their enrollment. He stressed the need for training of entrants to the legal profession at the bar level.  
He acknowledged that the key issue the country’s judiciary was facing was huge backlog of cases at the levels of higher and subordinate courts. However, he added that the Covid-19 pandemic had been the main reason behind the pendency of cases.  
Justice Ahmad also termed frivolous litigation a major cause of the huge backlog of cases in the courts. The lawyers should not become a tool in initiating frivolous litigation.  
He urged the lawyers to extend their cooperation to the courts to end pendency of cases. “The litigant public is the ultimate sufferer of the pendency of cases.”  
He also sought support of the legal fraternity to encourage the use of Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) system to avoid prolonged litigation. He asked the lawyers to end the culture of seeking adjournments in cases and ensure speedy decisions.  
Chief Justice Ahmad expressed concern over the poor infrastructure of the subordinate judiciary in all provinces and asked the chief justices of the provincial high courts to play their role in improving the facilities.  
He said the Judicial Commission on Appointment of Judges in higher and superior judiciary had been working in a most democratic manner. The commission appoints judges with a majority vote and its members include the bar’s representatives.  
Lahore High Court Chief Justice Muhammad Ameer Bhatti, Advocate General of Punjab Ahmad Awais and Supreme Court Bar Association president Ahsan Bhoon also spoke on the occasion.

2,PM’s aide hails arrival of $3bn from Saudi Arabia,"Much-needed boost for SBP, which has seen reserves decline by $4bn in three months","KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan on Saturday said it has received $3 billion from the Saudi Fund for Development to keep the US dollars in its account to enhance its foreign reserves.  
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue Shaukat Tarin also announced that the SBP had received Saudi Arabia’s $3bn deposit. “Good news, $3bn Saudi deposit received by SBP. I want to thank His Excellency Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman and [the] kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the kind gesture,” he tweeted. 
Pakistan received the Saudi fund after its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund in Washington for resu­mption of loans succeeded. The country received $3bn within a week after signing an agreement with the SFD on Nov 29 following Prime Minister Imran Khan’s visit to the Kingdom in October. 

Much-needed boost for SBP, which has seen reserves decline by $4bn in three months

It was agreed that Saudi Arabia would also provide $1.2bn worth of oil supplies to Pakistan on deferred payments. 
However, the government is tight-lipped over the terms and conditions of the agreement, triggering speculations that it is in favour of the lending country.  
When approached to know the conditions, the SBP replied: “As per agreement all terms are confidential and cannot be revealed without the consent of both the parties.” 
Analysts were particularly critical about the suspected condition of withdrawal of $3bn within three days, which can destabilize the balance of payments anytime. Also, rate of return was not disclosed by the government as analysts speculate higher returns compared to prevailing rates in the international markets. 
Foreign exchange reserves of the SBP lost over $4bn within three months, which is alarming since the imports payments have gone beyond expectation. The SBP reserves fell from $20.074bn in August to $16.010bn on November 26. 
The unexpected 162 per cent rise of trade deficit in November jolted both the government and the currency market reflecting the unavoidable high dollar demand for imports. The trade deficit reached $5.107bn in November against $1.946bn in the same month of last fiscal year. 
The first five months of the current fiscal year witnessed 117.25pc trade deficit as it rose to $20.746bn compared to $9.549bn of the same months of last financial year. 
The massive trade deficit has created a serious threat to current account balance that has already entered a crucial state. The current account deficit in four months of FY22 was over $5bn against a surplus of $1.3bn of last year. The reverse situation has created a panic-like situation in the currency market as the day-to-day devaluation of local currency compelled importers to book more for the future imports. The SBP has the target to keep the current account deficit at 2 to 3 per cent of GDP in FY22 while it has already crossed the target in first quarter with 4.2 per cent of GDP. 
The government expects to receive $1bn from the IMF while it will raise about $1bn by launching Sukuk bonds in the international market. The country needs more inflows but both the foreign direct investment and remittances declined in October. 
The domestic Bonds like treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds could not attract foreign investment during FY22 while the inflows in Roshan Digital Account also have slowed down.

3,Make-or-break PDM meeting tomorrow,"Sources say there are differences among the parties, mainly the JUI-F and the PML-N, over key issues.","ISLAMABAD: Heads of the component parties of the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) will be meeting again on Monday (tomorrow) in an effort to prepare an anti-government protest plan with consensus.   
Sources in the opposition parties told Dawn that there were differences among the parties, mainly between the two major components of the PDM — Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) — over the issues of en masse resignations from parliament and converting the long march into an indefinite sit-in.  
Besides this, the two parties also have different viewpoints on the issue of boycotting the upcoming local government elections in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. 
They said JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman believed that they should start their long march after submitting resignations from the parliament whereas the PML-N was against the idea, saying that such a move would prove futile if collective resignations do not come from all the opposition parties, including the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).   
Similarly, they said, when the JUI-F wanted the PML-N and other opposition parties to boycott the local bodies polls, the PML-N believed that they should not leave the field open for the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and its allies.  
In their last meeting on Nov 23, the PDM had failed to come up with a plan to launch its anti-government protest campaign, with the alliance’s president, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, declaring that they would meet on Dec 6 and devise “a final policy” and “announce very important decisions”. 
“We had a detailed debate on the prevailing situation in the country. Next meeting of the PDM heads will be held in Islamabad on Dec 6. Before this meeting, all the component parties will submit their recommendations [regarding launching of the anti-government protest movement] after holding in-house consultations within their respective decision-making and powerful bodies,” the Maulana had said while talking to reporters after around four-hour long meeting which was attended by PML-N supreme leader Nawaz Sharif, party president Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz via video link. 
In the last meeting, the Maulana was so furious with the PML-N leadership that at one stage, he reportedly even offered to quit the opposition alliance’s presidentship. However, at that time, Nawaz Sharif persuaded the JUI-F chief not to do so and sought time till Dec 6 for in-house consultations. 
It was the third meeting of the heads of the component parties in six weeks, besides a number of meetings of its steering committee, after which the alliance leaders had announced that they were deferring the plan to launch, what they always say, a decisive and final phase of the anti-government protest that would culminate with a long march towards Islamabad. 
Maulana Fazl evaded repeated questions by reporters about the possible long march and en masse resignations from the assemblies and simply asked them to wait till Dec 6. 
“The time is not too far. We will move towards a final decision to rid the nation of the present oppression,” he had stated. 
Rejecting a perception that there was a deadlock among parties on certain matters, the Maulana had said they wanted to make decisions after thoroughly reviewing the possible outcomes of their moves while maintaining unity among the PDM component parties. 
Journalists and political experts were expecting that the opposition alliance would devise a solid plan this time as the meeting had taken place only a day after the alliance’s steering committee announced that it had finalised its recommendations for the anti-government protest plan, which would be announced after the party heads’ approval on Nov 23. 
Briefing the reporters about the decisions of the steering committee on Nov 22, PDM spokesman Hafiz Hamdullah had said they had proposed protest rallies, road caravans, sits-in, shutter-down and wheel-jam strikes over the next four months and a final long march towards Islamabad in March next year. He had claimed that the option of resignations from the legislatures was also under consideration. 
Earlier on Nov 6, PDM’s general secretary Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had announced that they had decided to launch a “decisive” anti-government protest campaign, starting with a public meeting in Karachi on Nov 13 and culminating with a long march to Islamabad, the date of which would be finalised later. 
The PDM had started its protest campaign in October last year with public meetings in major cities. Some of the public gatherings were also addressed by self-exiled PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif through video link. 
Two other opposition parties — the PPP and Awami National Party (ANP) — were also part of the PDM at that time. 
The first phase of the alliance’s movement came to an abrupt end when the PDM leadership failed to announce any future programme following its last public meeting in Lahore on Dec 31, 2020. 
In March 2021, the PPP and ANP parted ways from the PDM after developing differences over the issue of en masse resignations from parliament and the controversial nomination of PPP’s Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani as leader of the opposition in the Senate.

4,Pakistan to host OIC’s extraordinary session on 19th,FM says P5 countries also invited to mobilise resources for Afghanistan,"LAHORE: Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi says Pakistan is set to host an ext­raordinary session of the Orga­nisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to plan to avert a humanitarian crisis which is rearing its head in Afghanistan following US withdrawal.  
“It will be a historic and costly mistake to abandon Afgh­a­nistan at this critical juncture, which may lead to a humanitarian crisis, economic collapse and eventual instability in the region,” he said.  
Speaking at a press conference at the Governor House here on Saturday, the foreign minister said the session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers in Islamabad on Dec 19 would bring world leaders’ attention towards the fact that lack of prompt response would lead to food shortages for some 22.8 million people and affect about 3.2m children with malnutrition in Afghanistan.  
He said the conference would help mobilise resources to help Afghanistan and added that Pakistan was already providing wheat, other edible items and medicines. He assured that India would be facilitated if it would send wheat through Pakistani land, as announced.  

FM says P5 countries also invited to mobilise resources for Afghanistan  

The coming OIC session is being held in Pakistan after a gap of 41 years, Mr Qureshi said and added that Pakistan had also invited special representatives of P5 countries, vice-president of European Union, and representatives of relevant UN agencies and the World Bank. “Germany, Japan, Canada and Australia have also been invited to help develop an international consensus on bringing Afghan­istan out of crisis,” he said.  
The foreign minister said Pa­k­istan would invite a high-level delegation from Afghan­istan so that they could engage and be engaged by the world leaders to know about ground realities and take informed decisions.  
“Triggering of the crisis in Afghanistan will lead to mass exodus of refugees and Pakis­tan’s resources are not encouraging to host more such guests as it is already taking care of some three million refugees,” the foreign minister said and added that these concerns had been shared with the neighbouring countries.  
After the US withdrawal on Aug 15, Mr Qureshi said, India had launched an online campaign against Pakistan with a hashtag “Sanction Pakistan” but the latter’s diplomacy foiled Indian plans. “Pakistan, with its diplomatic outreach, has already convinced the international community that engagement with Afghanistan is in the best interest of all nations.”   
He said Pakistan had also been able to establish a platform of “six neighbours of Afghanistan” to develop a coordinated approach on Afghanistan.  
Answering a question about Pakistan’s position in FATF grey list, the foreign minister said the country had completed 26.5 steps out of 27 steps and now there was no reason that the Financial Action Task Force would keep Pakistan in the grey list in its next meeting.  
Claiming that most of the FATF members agreed that Pakistan had done a lot, Mr Qureshi said there were some nations, including India, that wanted to do arm-twisting of Pakistan. He also said the FATF was a technical forum but India had politicised it.   
“If the FATF will keep Pakistan in grey list yet again, it will lose its credibility,” the foreign minister asserted.  
Responding to another question about a tweet and a letter by Pakistan embassies in Serbia and Bangladesh, respectively, he said the tweet and the letter were fake as there was no break in payment of salaries to officials of the embassies.   
He chided the Indian government for taking every opportunity to malign Pakistan and said New Delhi got exposed after every failed attempt.  
Mr Qureshi said Pakistan was having best relations with China and he had talked to Chinese foreign minister on Friday evening and both agreed that no development project would be stopped in Pakistan. He said those disturbed over the development works under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor continued trying to disrupt the projects and strain Pak-China relation but they would never succeed in their nefarious designs.  
Asked about Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar’s criticism of the PTI government over accepting all demands of the IMF, Mr Qureshi said such things happened in politics and added that it was “sign of life to think beyond your commitments”.  
Allaying media’s apprehension about Mr Sarwar’s departure from the government, the foreign minister said the governor was not going anywhere and such speculations would die down soon.  
The foreign minister, however, agreed that Pakistan was facing a severe financial crisis and added that this crisis was also felt by the global economy due to Covid-19. He said inflation was a challenge for the whole world including Pakistan but the developed countries had resources to manage it. “Pakistan has a limited window of maneuverability,” he lamented and hoped that the country would come out of the economic crisis in the next few months.  
On a question about Kashmir issue, the foreign minister said Pakistan had diverted attention of the world towards Kashmir issue and managed a debate on this issue thrice in United Nations Security Council. “Pakistan will yet again raise Kashmir issue at international level in March next year,” he added.  
About the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in coming elections, Mr Qureshi said the government always wanted to take the opposition parties on board on the use of EVMs and other important legislation in the parliament.
