0,Military court convicts rights activist of espionage,"Amnesty International urges authorities to give Idris access to lawyers, produce him before a civilian court.","ISLAMABAD: Rights and political activist Idris Khattak has been convicted of espionage and sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment, a security source disclosed on Saturday. 
“Khattak was found guilty of espionage and leaking of sensitive information by a Field General Court Martial (FGCM). He was handed down 14-year rigorous jail term,” the source said while talking to Dawn. 
The verdict was pronounced this week after the trial concluded in Jhelum. 
The source said he was tried under Pakistan Army Act and Official Secrets Act, 1923. He was accused of providing sensitive information to a foreign intelligence agency. 
Defending his court martial, the source said that any individual accused of espionage, whether or not he is a serviceman, can be tried by a FGCM. 
Khattak has reportedly been shifted to Jhelum district jail for serving the sentence.

The source said he could appeal before the appellate tribunal and subsequently before the army chief. 
Khattak remained associated with Amnesty International and had investigated enforced disappearances in erstwhile tribal areas and Balochistan. 
He was travelling from Islamabad to Peshawar on November 13, 2019 when he was picked by an intelligence agency near Swabi interchange. After nearly six months of public campaign by his family and filing of a habeas corpus petition at the Peshawar High Court, the defence ministry on June 16, 2020 admitted that he was in military’s custody and had been charged with treason under the Official Secrets Act. 
Khattak’s brother later filed a petition with the Peshawar High Court seeking an end to his trial by the military court. The high court, however, on Jan 28, 2021 rejected the appeal. 
Meanwhile, three retired military officers were given varying jail sentences by another FGCM in Rawalpindi. 
According to the security source, Lt Col (retd) Faiz Rasool was given 14 years rigorous imprisonment, Lt Col (retd) Akmal 10 years rigorous imprisonment, and Maj (retd) Saifuddin 12 years rigorous imprisonment. 
All three officers were also convicted of espionage and leaking sensitive information. 
The source said all the three were retired at the time of the commissioning of crime.

In a reaction to Khattak’s sentencing, Amnesty International’s Deputy South Asia Director Thyagi Ruwanpathirana said: “Idris Khattak’s family and lawyer are being kept in the dark by the Pakistani authorities about the exact status of his case and reported conviction, violating the right to fair trial and due process and making it impossible for them to plan any legal recourse.” 
“If his conviction is confirmed, it will be the culmination of a shameful two-year process that has been unjust from start to finish,” the AI official said. 

 



 
Few details about the case against him had been disclosed, the official said, while according to his lawyer, the proceedings were ‘deeply flawed’. 
AI asked Pakistan’s authorities to provide details of the case to the family, give him access to lawyers, and produce him before a civilian court for deciding about lawfulness of his arrest and detention.

1,Pakistan begins supplying free medicines to Afghanistan,Consignment worth Rs25m dispatched from Karachi.,"KARACHI: Pakistan has started supplying free medicines to Afghanistan in a move to strengthen its assistance to the neighbouring country facing serious medical and health challenges, industry sources said on Saturday. 
The first consignment of medicines worth Rs25 million was dispatched from Karachi for treatment of viral diseases, regular drugs for common diseases among elders and stock of supplies used in emergencies. 
“This is the first consignment of our plan of medical assistance in Afghanistan,” said Atif Iqbal of Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA).
“After a week or so we would be dispatching another such consignment worth Rs100m. The industry has responded to appeal from Afghanistan’s health minister who had recently sought support from Pakistan’s health sector including healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical industry.”
He said the industry was also sorting out immediate medical needs of Afghanistan and coordinating with member manufacturers in all major cities of Pakistan. 

Consignment worth Rs25m dispatched from Karachi

In September, the World Health Organi­sation (WHO) warned that Afghanistan’s health system is on the brink of collapse. The head of global health body explained that the starving families’ suffering is as acute in urban areas as in the drought-stricken rural parts of the country. 
After meeting senior Taliban officials, medical professionals and patients, the WHO said that a lack of financial support for Afghanistan’s largest health project, Sehet­mandi, had left thousands of facilities unable to buy medical supplies and pay salaries. 
Fewer than one in five of the country’s Sehetmandi facilities remained open, the WHO had explained, although it said that access to all communities was “no longer impeded”. 
“Apart from medicines, we have sent wheelchairs and other crucial medical equi­pment,” said Ghulam Hashim Noorani of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Associa­tion. “It’s a beginning and we hope that our industry would come forward and meet the expectations of our Afghan brothers and sisters. They desperately need our help.” 
The Pakistani health authorities last month announced that they would cooperate with Afghanistan in improving its healthcare infrastructure, which has been affected badly due to the conflict. PM’s Adviser on Health Dr Faisal Sultan had asked the Afghan authorities to ‘define their health needs’ for assistance from Pakistan. 
Pakistan has already established a 300-bed tertiary-care health facility in Kabul, titled “Mohammad Ali Jinnah Hospital”, which is the only functional public health facility currently with 50 oxygenated beds for Covid-19 patients.

2,Air defence test sparks loud blast near Iran nuclear site,"Iranian army spokesman Gen Amir Tarikhani says there is ""nothing to fear"".","TEHRAN: An air defence test triggered a loud explosion near Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment facility on Saturday as nuclear talks with major powers stumble.
The explosion was heard in the skies over the Iranian city of Badroud, just 20km from the nuclear plant, the official IRNA news agency reported.
“Badroud residents heard the noise and saw a light which showed an object had just blown up in the skies over the city,” a witness said.
But the spokesman for the Iranian army, Gen Amir Tarikhani, told state television there was no cause for concern.
“An hour ago, one of our missile systems in the region was tested to assess the state of readiness on the ground, and there is nothing to fear,” Tarikhani said.
Israel has said repeatedly that it stands ready to use all means, including force, to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability, and Iran has carried out periodic exercises to improve the defences around its nuclear sites.
“To evaluate the systems based in the region, such exercises are carried out in a completely secure environment and in full coordination with the integrated defence network,” the army spokesman said.
Israel has been pushing hard for world powers to abandon talks with Iran on reviving a 2015 nuclear deal, which reopened in Vienna on Monday.
“A bad deal, which I hope they do not reach, is intolerable from our perspective,” the head of Israel’s Mossad external intelligence agency, David Barnea, said on Thursday.
The United States warned on Saturday that it would not allow Iran to “slow walk” negotiations on its nuclear programme while at the same time ramping up uranium enrichment and other activities.
