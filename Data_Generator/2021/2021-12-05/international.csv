0,German Social Democrats wave through coalition deal,The three-way alliance aims to modernise Europe’s biggest economy and step up efforts against climate change.,"BERLIN: German Chancellor-designate Olaf Scholz’s center-left party gave its overwhelming approval on Saturday to forming a new government with environmentalist and pro-business parties the first of three such decisions needed for Scholz to take office next week.
Scholz’s Social Democrats narrowly won Germany’s Sept 26 election and launched negotiations with the Greens and the business-friendly Free Democrats to form a governing coalition that hasn’t been tried before at the federal level. They emerged with a deal on Nov 24 after relatively quick negotiations.
The three-way alliance aims to modernise Europe’s biggest economy and step up efforts against climate change. It will send outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel’s center-right Christian Democratic Union into the opposition after 16 years and end an uncomfortable grand coalition of Germany’s traditional big parties in which the Social Democrats were the junior partners.
A lot of people have grown up with the idea that is natural for a member of the CDU to lead the government, and now ... the Social Democrats will provide the next chancellor, Scholz told a largely online party convention. This will be a government of three parties that want to venture more progress for Germany.
Scholz set his sights for the new alliance beyond just the four-year term that is now beginning. He said the government aims to work together in a friendly way and be re-elected.
The convention backed the coalition deal by 598 votes to seven, with three abstentions.
The plan is for parliament to elect Scholz as chancellor on Wednesday. 
He will lead what is known as a traffic light coalition after the parties’ colors of red, green and yellow.
Before that can happen, members of the three parties need to approve the coalition deal. 
A vote by the Free Democrats is expected on Sunday and the result of a ballot of the Greens 125,000-strong membership is expected on Monday.
Key pledges by the prospective partners include an increase in Germany’s minimum wage to 12 euros ($13.50) per hour from the current 9.60 euros a move that Scholz has said means a wage increase for 10 million. And they also aim to get 400,000 new apartments per year built in an effort to curb rising rental prices.
Scholz, 63, has been Merkel’s finance minister and vice chancellor since 2018. Unlike the other two parties, the Social Democrats haven’t yet named their remaining seven Cabinet nominees, who will include the interior, defence and health ministers. Overseeing the Health Ministry is a crucial job at a time when Germany is imposing new restrictions to break a surge of coronavirus infections. Now let’s get to work, Scholz said after Saturday’s vote.
The national disease control center on Saturday reported 64,510 new daily coronavirus cases and another 378 deaths, bringing Germany’s total deaths in the pandemic to 102,946. Merkel, in what is likely to be her last nationwide address, decried the country’s resurgent Covid-19 death toll and urged everyone to get vaccinated.
Every one of them leaves behind families or friends, stunned, speechless and helpless, Merkel said in her weekly video message. This is so bitter because it is avoidable. With the effective and safe vaccines, we have the key to this in our hands.

1,US vows to stop Russia from invading Ukraine,"US President Joe Biden says he will make it “very, very difficult” for Russia to launch any invasion of Ukraine.","WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden said on Friday he would make it “very, very difficult” for Russia to launch any invasion of Ukraine, which warned that a large-scale attack may be planned for next month. 
Washington and Kiev say Moscow has massed troops near Ukraine’s borders and accuse Russia of planning an invasion. 
Biden and President Vladimir Putin are due to hold a video call shortly to discuss the rising tensions, both sides confirmed on Friday. 
Biden told reporters in Washington he was putting together “the most comprehensive and meaningful set of initiatives to make it very, very difficult for Mr Putin to go ahead and do what people are worried he may do.”
Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has since backed separatists fighting Kiev in the east of the country. The conflict has left more than 13,000 dead. 
“The most likely time to reach readiness for escalation will be the end of January,” Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksiy Reznikov told parliament in Kiev on Friday. 
A report in the Washington Post on Friday, citing US officials and an intelligence document, said Russia was planning a multi-front offensive involving up to 175,000 troops as soon as next year.

2,"Sialkot tragedy cannot be defended, Pakistani Americans say","“American lawmakers will be asking about it every time we go to discuss Pakistan with them.""","WASHINGTON: “The Sialkot tragedy will have a horrible impact on our efforts to promote Pakistan in the US Congress,” says Dr Rao Kamran Ali, who heads the Pakistani American Political Action Committee.
Wajid Hassan of the Pakistani American Congress fears that this incident will have a long-lasting effect. “Every time we go and talk about Pakistan, they will ask about the Sialkot incident.”
Agha Hasnain, a Pakistani runner who has run 135 marathons in each of the 50 US states, says that whenever he gets a chance, he talks about Pakistan after an event. “But now, it will be very difficult to do so. This is unbelievably bad news for Pakistan.”

President PTI Washington, DC Junaid (Johnny) Bashir says he is ‘devastated.’ “We need to act now, arrest all those responsible and ensure that all of them are punished.”
Khawar Shamsul Hassan, a Pakistani American entrepreneur, agrees. “It is the perceived and real absence of law and order and accountability that emboldens the extremists to do such things,” he says.
The incident has jolted the Pakistani American community like the Peshawar school tragedy did in 2014. From Los Angeles, California, to Baltimore, Maryland, Pakistani Americans have posted hundreds of thousands of messages on social media, expressing their grief, anger and fear.
“They have turned the country into a madhouse,” says Bushra Ahmed of Baltimore. “Who will bell this insane cat?” asks Ras Siddiqui of Sacramento, California.
Mr Hassan of the Pakistani American Congress, who is from Seattle, Washington, says his group has been lobbying for Pakistan for the last eight years. “Every now and then, something happens that tarnishes the country’s image,” he says.
“This indicates that we have no tolerance for religious minorities in Pakistan. It will have a negative impact on everything, from tourism to investment,” he adds. “American lawmakers will be asking about it every time we go to discuss Pakistan with them.”
He thinks that it will also impede Pakistan’s effort to come off the FATF gray list and will be mentioned in international reports on religious intolerance as well.
Dr Khalid Abdullah of the Physicians for Social Responsibility NGO suggests “reconsidering policies and laws that encourage such violence. “Burning someone alive! No, people are not going to forget it anytime soon. We have crossed the limits of narrow-mindedness.”
Dr Ali of Pak Pac, who lives in Dallas, regrets the failure of the Pakistani state in curbing such activities. “When something so horrible happens, something that is also evidence-based, it is difficult to deal with,” he says. “TLP committed such atrocities before too. Then it made a truce. It went back to violence and made another pact with the authorities! How long will this continue?” he asks. This must stop.”
“We are so ashamed! No word can describe our feeling,” says Mr Bashir of PTI, who lives in Virginia. “Americans already have a bad image of Pakistan, and this makes it worse. The only way to deal with it is to give exemplary punishment to the perpetrators.”
Mr Hasnain, the runner from Virginia, says his daughter “showed me the news and asked: ‘What’s happening in Pakistan?’ I said those are foolish people. But she, ‘that’s not an answer. Tell me how they let this happen?’”
“Our state has backed down many times in the face of street power and that sends the wrong message. This must stop now,” says Mr. Hassan, the entrepreneur from Maryland.

3,Total solar eclipse plunges Antarctica into darkness,"The last total solar eclipse in Antarctica occurred on November 23, 2003 and the next one will not be until 2039.","SANTIAGO: A total solar eclipse plunged Antarctica from summer into darkness early on Saturday in a rare astronomical spectacle witnessed by a handful of scientists and thrill-seekers — and countless penguins.
“The visibility was excellent,” said Raul Cordero of the University of Santiago de Chile (USACH), who was on site to witness  “totality” at 0746 GMT, with the  “ring of fire” phase lasting just over 40 seconds.
Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, casting its shadow on Earth. For the eclipse to be total, the Sun, Moon and Earth must be directly aligned.
Totality was visible only in Antarctica, experienced by a small number of scientists, experts and adventure tourists — who paid some $40,000 for the privilege.
Streamed live by Nasa from the Union Glacier camp in Antarctica, the eclipse began at 0700 GMT as the Moon began to move in front of the Sun, coming to an end at 0806 GMT.

 



 
The Union Glacier camp is situated about 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) north of the South Pole.
According to Nasa, a partial eclipse was also visible across parts of the southern hemisphere, including parts of Saint Helena, Namibia, Lesotho, South Africa, Chile, New Zealand and Australia.
The last total solar eclipse in Antarctica occurred on November 23, 2003 and the next one will not be until 2039.
An annular solar eclipse — in which the Moon obscures all but an outer ring of the Sun — is set to sweep across North America in October 2023, followed by a total eclipse in April 2024.

4,"Macron says France, Saudi Arabia to work to resolve Lebanon row",Says Saudi Arabia and France  “want to fully engage” on re-establishing relations between Riyadh and Beirut.,"JEDDAH: France and Saudi Arabia have committed to  “fully engage” to resolve a diplomatic row between the Gulf kingdom and Lebanon, visiting French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday.
His announcement came after meeting in the Red Sea city of Jeddah with Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with whom Macron said he had a  “no taboos” discussion about human rights.
Macron said that he and Prince Mohammed held a joint telephone conversation with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati in an effort to resolve the crisis that was sparked in October between Beirut and several Gulf states — in particular Saudi Arabia, which had blocked imports.
Saudi Arabia and France  “want to fully engage” on re-establishing relations between Riyadh and Beirut, the French president told reporters before his departure.
“With Saudi Arabia, we have made commitments towards Lebanon: to work together, to support reforms, to enable the country to emerge from the crisis and preserve its sovereignty,” Macron said on Twitter.
Mikati said later that the phone call was  “an important step towards resuming historical brotherly relations” with Riyadh.
Macron said he would speak with Lebanese President Michel Aoun by telephone on Sunday. The Gulf dispute has exacerbated an already dire situation in Lebanon, which is in the grip of a deep economic and financial crisis.
Macron’s efforts likely received a boost by the resignation of Lebanese information minister Georges Kordahi, whose remarks on the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen sparked the row.
The French president has spearheaded international efforts to help Lebanon out of its economic downturn, as the country’s fragile government has been struggling to secure international aid, particularly from wealthy Arab powers.
Lebanon’s ties with Gulf states have also grown increasingly strained in recent years due to the growing influence of Iran-backed Lebanese movement Hezbollah.
Macron and Prince Mohammed also discussed bilateral relations, areas of partnership and prospects for cooperation, according to the official Saudi Press Agency.
The French president’s departure from Jeddah ended his Gulf tour, which also saw him visit the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
He became one of the first Western leaders to meet with Prince Mohammed in the kingdom since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside Riyadh’s Istanbul consulate in 2018. The killing by Saudi agents severely tarnished Prince Mohammed’s international image.
Prince Mohammed shook hands with Macron, who wore a face mask, welcoming him at the royal palace before talks and a lunch together. Dialogue with Saudi Arabia was necessary to  “work for stability in the region”, Macron said on Friday.
However, he added in a reference to the Khashoggi murder that  “it doesn’t mean that I endorse anything”. “I note that Saudi Arabia had organised the G20 summit... not many powers boycotted the G20,” despite the Khashoggi affair, said Macron.
