0,IHC to hear Vawda’s intra-court appeal tomorrow,PTI senator argues ECP failed to take decision within prescribed time.,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has constituted a division bench to hear the intra-court appeal of Senator Faisal Vawda seeking to stop the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) from proceeding against him in the disqualification case. 
A division bench comprising Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb will hear the appeal of the ruling party’s senator on Monday (tomorrow). 
Senator Vawda challenged the October 12 decision by which the ECP had rejected his plea for halting proceedings against him in the disqualification case. 
In the intra-court appeal, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf senator contended that the case against him in the ECP had become invalid, as the body had failed to take a decision within the prescribed time limit. He further said the single-member IHC bench comprising the chief justice did not consider the facts described in his plea for similar relief. 

PTI senator argues ECP failed to take decision within prescribed time

While dismissing his petition on Nov 12, Chief Justice Athar Minallah noted that an application had been filed against Mr Vawda within 60 days and called upon the senator to prove his innocence and let the ECP take action in accordance with the law if he was clear. 
In an application filed before the ECP in 2020, petitioner Dost Ali sought Mr Vawda’s disqualification for hiding information related to his dual nationality. The applicant challenged his election as a member of the National Assembly on the ground that he allegedly also held American nationality when he filed his nomination papers for contesting the elections. 
The petition stated that since Mr Vawda had furnished an affidavit to the ECP to the effect that he was not a national of any other country at the time of contesting the elections, he had made a ‘false statement on oath’, hence he was disqualified under Article 62 (1)(f) of the Constitution. 
The ECP earlier this week gave last chance to Senator Vawda to explain the concealment of his foreign nationality. 
A three-member ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja, while hearing the petition seeking disqualification of the ruling party senator for not disclosing his foreign nationality gave Mr Vawda last chance and adjourned hearing till Dec 23. 
The CEC gave Senator Vawda the option to either submit his arguments to the commission in writing, in which case the bench would reserve its ruling or present the arguments himself so that the bench could issue a verdict. 
The PTI senator contended that he had possessed dual citizenship since birth. At this, the CEC pointed out the issue was whether he possessed dual citizenship at the time of filing his nomination papers for contesting the 2018 elections. 
Mr Vawda said he had already surrendered his American passport, but in the same breath feigned ignorance about the law regarding renunciation of the nationality of any country. He maintained he was unaware of the requirement to submit a renunciation certificate as well, saying he would try to obtain one.

1,Record-holding Shehroze dreams of climbing world’s all tallest peaks,"In July, the young climber confronted history, mortality on K2 summit","LAHORE: Shehroze Kashif faced many dangers climbing the planet’s tallest peaks, but his toughest moment came when he passed the corpse of his hero on the savage slopes of K2. 
Kashif was 19 years and 138 days old when in July he became the youngest person to summit both Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak, and K2, the second-highest. 
It was on K2, just below the infamous stretch known as the Bottleneck, that he passed the bodies of Iceland’s John Snor­­ri, Chile’s Juan Pablo Mohr and Pakistan’s climbing legend Ali Sadpara. 

In July, the young climber confronted history, mortality on K2 summit 

“The most emotional mo­­ment for me was going on past those climbers, the dead body of Pakistan’s national hero,” Kashif said in an interview. 
Many Pakistanis have crucial roles as high-altitude porters, but Sadpara was one of the few to break into the elite ranks of mostly western climbers who have long dominated headlines in mountaineering. 
He was declared missing along with Snorri and Mohr on Feb 5. It was more than five mo­­nths before their bodies were found, on July 26, and Kashif made his summit push as dawn broke the next morning.
“I got emotional, thinking that they had come with the same passion I had,” Kashif said. 
“But then I thought, why not fulfil their unfulfilled dream? And I took their dream with me.”  
This month, the Guinness Book of World Records officially declared him the youngest person to climb K2 and the youngest to climb both the world’s two highest mountains. 
Kashif summited Everest, which at 8,849 metres is Earth’s tallest peak, in May. 
But the 8,611-metre K2 — known as the `Savage Mountain’ and located near Pakistan’s border with China — is the more brutal summit. 
They are “poles apart”, Kashif said, calling K2 a “beast”. 
In winter, winds can blow at more than 200km per hour and temperatures can drop to minus 60 degrees Celsius. 
Kashif suffered snow blindness and frostbite — and said he was lucky his big toe was not amputated. 
“My energy was too low, it was a difficult time... One wrong step and you are history,” he told AFP from his home in Lahore. 
Blessings of God 
Kashif was first entra­n­ced by the mountains at 11 years old when he spotted the scenic 3,885-metre Hi­­malayan peak Makra while on holiday with his father in northern Pakistan. “It all started there,” he said.
While standing on top of the world he felt “chosen” — a feeling that he described leaving on the peak, “so others coming behind you can also feel it”. Now, he said, Everest and K2 are not enough. 
He plans to become the youngest person to climb the world’s 14 highest mountains, the only peaks on the planet that are above 8,000 metres. 
All lie in Asia, in the Himalayas or the Karakoram range, and five are in Pakistan. 
Only around 40 people in history are believed to have climbed all 14. But it can be difficult to verify summit claims and some experts said there could be even fewer. 
The youngest is Mingma Gyabu “David” Sherpa, of Nepal, who the Guinness Book of World Records said summited them all by age 30. 
Kashif still has 10 to go. 
He has also climbed Manaslu in Nepal and Broad Peak in Pakistan, the eighth and 12th highest mountains, respectively — and has given himself until 2024 to summit the rest. He is well aware of the dangers. 
Pakistan mourned the loss of Sadpara but Kashif also lost a friend, Pakistani-Swiss climber Abdul War­aich, on Everest in May. 
Still, he refuses to contemplate an urban life at sea level. 
“I think mountains are blessings of God,” he said. 
“I feel tired looking at all these concrete buildings, garbage and pollution. “I just go where I feel most alive, and I feel mountains are the most suitable place for me.”

2,All demands of Gwadar protesters accepted: Langove,Says action is being taken against illegal trawlers involved in fishing in Balochistan waters.,"GWADAR: Adviser to the Chief Minister for Home Mir Zia Langove has clai­m­­ed that the government has accepted all demands of those who have launched the Gwadar Ko Haq Do movement. 
Speaking at a press conference after meeting the leader of participants of the sit-in on Saturday, he urged Maulana Hidayat-Ur-Rehman to call off his 20-day sit-in as the government had already agreed to resolve all issues. 
Mr Langove said the government had already star­t­­ed taking steps to resolve the issues. 
He said that ac­­tion was being taken against illegal trawlers invol­­ved in fishing in Balochistan waters. However, he said that it would take time to deal with the mafia involved in this business. 
“DG Fisheries is conducting an operation against trawlers. Pakistan Navy and MSA have also been asked about the operation,” the adviser said, adding that border trade had already started after opening the border with Iran. 
In reply to a question, Mr Langove said that the decision to send 5,000 police personnel to Gwadar had been taken for maintaining law and order in Gwadar and the government was not in favour of ending the sit-in by force from day one.
