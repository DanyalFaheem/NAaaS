0,"JIT clears Lower Dir judge of rape charge, says case ‘fit for cancellation’",Police official says the complainant has a long criminal record and at least 8 cases registered against her.,"PESHAWAR: A joint investigation team has cleared a senior civil judge in Lower Dir district of a rape charge.
In a related development, the accused, Jamshed Kundi, was granted bail by district sessions judge Shoaib Khan on Saturday.
On Nov 25, the Lower Dir police had arrested the senior civil judge after a woman accused him of sexually assaulting her at his official residence.
The two-page JIT report, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said the police received a report from the Forensic Science Laboratory, Peshawar, on Friday, which declared the ‘samples sent for analysis negative for the semen’s presence’.
“Meeting of the JIT decided that case is fit for cancellation and fresh case will be registered against present complainant if accused Jamshed Kundi intends to lodge his application to this effect,” it said.

Accused gets bail from local court

The report said a joint investigation team, headed by the district police officer Lower Dir was constituted to investigate the incident following the registration of FIR.
It noted that call detailed records (CDRs) of both the accused and victims were obtained and scrutiny established contacts between them.
The report said the further scrutiny of CDRs showed that the woman complainant had contacted the police’s emergency number 15 at least on 20 occasions from Nov 9 to Nov 25, 2021, in different areas.
“Eight of these calls were made in Peshawar on November 9, nine in Muzaffarabad on November 16, one in Bahawalpur on November 20 and two in Timergara on November 25,” it said.
The report said the CDRs also confirmed interaction between the accused and the complainant.
It said the woman complainant had earlier misstated her identity and claimed to a resident of Khairpur district in Sindh province and that the investigation established that she was faking identities and addresses.
It added that the complainant was found to be a resident of Rahimyar Khan district in Punjab province after the National Database and Registration Authority records revealed the number of her brother’s identity card.
The report said when the JIT contacted Punjab police for her criminal record, they shared eight FIRs registered against her in different cities of the province.
When contacted, Lower Dir DPO Irfanullah Khan confirmed the contents of the JIT report.
He said the woman complainant had a long criminal record and had at least eight cases registered against her in Rahimyar Khan, Lodharan, Multan and Lahore.
The DPO said in Sept this year, the woman ‘did something similar’ in Karak district but the matter was settled out of court.
He said the woman complainant was sent to the Swat Darul Aman.
Mr Irfanullah, however, said staff members of Darul Aman complained to the police about the woman’s misbehaviour and called for her immediate relocation fearing she could cause a big problem for them and therefore, the woman was brought back to the Timergara jail.
On Nov 25, the complainant had alerted the Lower Dir police claiming she had been sexually assaulted by the judge at her official residence. She insisted that the judge had asked for Rs1.5 million bribe for providing a job to her sister three months ago. As she didn’t have that amount, she gave the judge her Rs1.5m jewellery.
The woman claimed that the judge contacted her on Nov 25 and said he was unable to secure job for her sister and therefore, she should accompany him to Lower Dir to collect her jewellery.
She claimed that she travelled to Lower Dir from Peshawar in the judge’s official vehicle and after reaching his official residence in Balambat Colony, the judge told her that he would return her jewellery only if she agreed to have sex with him. On her refusal, the judge sexually assaulted her.
The Peshawar High Court has already suspended the judge following the registration of a case of sexual assault against him.

6,"Haripur, Kohistan people oppose new division",CM’s announcement termed bid to sabotage Hazara province movement...,"HARIPUR/MANSEHRA: The government’s announcement to make Abaseen division was a conspiracy to sabotage the movement for a separate Hazara province, Abdul Saboor Qureshi, a senior leader of Tehreek-i-Suba Hazara, said on Saturday.
Commenting on the recent announcement of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mahmood Khan during a public meeting in Battagram regarding creation of Abaseen division comprising some areas in Hazara and Malakand divisions predominantly inhabited by the Pashto-speaking people, Mr Qureshi said the CM’s statement had hurt the sentiments of people of Hazara, who had been demanding a separate province on administrative grounds.
Talking to mediapersons in Haripur on Saturday, he said despite terming the demand o Hazara people for a separate province genuine on several occasions, the PTI leadership had taken an about turn after coming into power. 
He said precious lives had been sacrificed during the long-running struggle, but the CM’s statement clearly showed the PTI government was going to divide the people of Hazara on linguistic grounds.

CM’s announcement termed bid to sabotage Hazara province movement

Mr Qureshi said the Tehreek-i-Suba Hazara that was founded by late Baba Haider Zaman, who had always advocated for the creation of new provinces on administrative grounds.
To a question, Mr Qureshi said all the tribes of Hazara division from Haripur to Kohistan and Battagram to Torghar were united behind the cause of Hazara province. 
He said instead of giving equal development funds and improving the living standard of people of the districts in the upper Hazara region, the government wanted to bifurcate Hazara division on linguistic grounds.
Meanwhile, a jirga held in Dasu area of Upper Kohistan the other day demanded that the government create Kohistan division comprising Lower and Upper Kohistan and Kolai-Palas districts. It, however, opposed naming the division as Abaseen.
“We won’t allow the government to name the proposed division as Abaseen,” warned Maulana Dildar, a former MPA, while speaking at the jirga.
The jirga was organised by the Muttahida Kohistan Movement.
“We want a new division for the people of three districts, and if the government doesn’t agree with us we will prefer to remain within the Hazara division,” Maulana Dildar said.
The jirga was also attended by office-bearers of various political parties.
“We don’t want to be part of the Abaseen division and appeal to the government to respect our sentiments,” Maulana Kareemdad, another elder, said.
He said they would never accept inclusion of three Kohistan districts in any division also comprising Battagram district of the neighbouring Malakand division.
“We are aware of the PTI government’s intentions as the local government elections are round the corner and it wants to divide people to secure a win, but it won’t be allowed to happen,” Mr Kareemdad warned.

Addressing a workers’ meeting here, he said the mini-budget would compound the people’s misery, who had already been hard hit by the galloping inflation. 
On this occasion, known political and social figures -- Haji Amin and Haji Rahim -- announced joining the QWP, according to a statement.
Mr Sherpao was critical of the government’s recent deal with the International Monetary Fund, saying it would cause a fresh wave of inflation in the country. He added the PTI government was acting on the diktats of the IMF and was least bothered to provide relief to people, who were grappling with backbreaking inflation.
Mr Sherpao said the people were no longer in a position to cope with the rising inflation coupled with unemployment. He said though the government secured huge loans from the IMF and other international lenders, it failed to revive the economy.
He said using the electronic voting machines in elections would disenfranchise the women and the elderly in the rural areas as most of the voters living in the countryside were less educated and lacked the technical know-how to cast their votes through the EVMs.

10,Transplantation regulatory body without top boss for over a year,Officials say vacancy hampering plans to promote organ donation...,"PESHAWAR: The administrator’s office at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Medical Transplantation Regulatory Authority has been lying vacant for over a year hampering plans to promote organ donation in the province for transplantation.
According to health officials, the MTRA has become dysfunctional due to the top vacancy.
Prof Asif, a renal transplant surgeon at the government-run Institute of Kidney Diseases, was the last MTRA administrator, who abandoned the office after retirement in Sept 2020 on attaining the age of superannuation.
He was made the administrator for three years in 2017 and was re-appointed for three more years in Aug 2020.
The government had established the MTRA in Nov 2016 to enforce the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Medical Transplantation Regulatory Authority Act, 2014, for regulating the transplantation of human organs.

Officials say vacancy hampering plans to promote organ donation

The authority recognised the IKD as the first facility to perform surgical procedures for the purpose leading to the first transplant a few months later free of charge.
Officials told Dawn that Prof Asif’s retirement led to a halt to renal transplants at the IKD.
They said Prof Asif along with his team had carried over 100 transplants in IKD, while around 50 were on the ‘waiting list’.
The officials said long delay in the filling of the top vacancy was hampering activities at the MTRA, especially the grant of no objection certificates to the people needing organ transplantation in private hospitals.
They said the regulatory authority had no offices, while its staff members totalling two worked from home to the trouble of patients as well as relevant officials.
The officials said the IKD, which pioneered renal transplantation in the province, had also recognised private hospitals for the procedure.
They said the MTRA was established to facilitate lawful transplants and check illegal ones in the province.
The officials insisted that the dysfunctional MTRA had led to the growing incidence of unlawful organ transplants.
They said the government had allocated Rs25 million for the MTRA to establish offices, buy stationery and vehicles, and perform other work, but the amount was unspent due to the vacancy of the administrator.
The officials said until Prof Asif was a government servant, the MTRA used his IKD office for operations but after his retirement, that was no more the case.
They said patients were seen search for the two MTRA employees for the mandatory transplantation NOC.
The officials said under the rules, the nine-member MTRA was required to hold a meeting every three months to discuss the cases of transplants, including donors and recipients, and check illegal transplantations in the province, but no such meeting had taken place during the last one year.
They said the new administrator was to be appointed by the chief minister on the recommendation of the chief secretary.
The officials said two private hospitals in Peshawar had already been recognised by the MTRA, where the patients wanted to undergo transplants.
They said patients got NOCs after long delays as the two MRTA employees feared legal issues over the matter.
The officials said certain conditions were to be fulfilled for renal transplants, which required the MTRA administrator and ‘committee’ members to evaluate cases approval.
They said besides renal transplants, the MTRA had authorised Hayatabad Medical Complex, Khyber Teaching Hospital and Lady Reading Hospital for corneal transplants as well.
The officials said the regulatory authority had planned to establish regional offices, recognise health facilities for transplants at the district level and check illegal procedures. 
They also said the MTRA was mandated under the law with raising public awareness of organ donation for transplantations, but the top vacancy had blocked plans for the purpose.
The officials said before doctors prepared patients for transplantation, extensive verification was carried out about the donors’ relation with them and get their particulars verified by the Nadra to ensure that the whole exercise take place within the parameters of the law.
They said the authority required offices as well as more staff members to carry out all functions appropriately.
