The tourists will arrive in the country a week later than originally scheduled and start with the Boxing Day Test, with two more five-day fixtures to be played in January.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed the later start on Saturday following their Annual General Meeting. The series was originally set to begin on Dec 17.
No reasons for cutting the T20s have been given, but it is likely to do with the later start of the Test series, which pushes the whole tour schedule out by a week.

2,Minhaj prevails in epic playoff to win Chairman JCSC Golf Championship,KARACHI: The country’s most lucrative golf tournament provided the most thrilling finish on Saturday...,"KARACHI: The country’s most lucrative golf tournament provided the most thrilling finish on Saturday.
Shabbir, who was two shots shy of Minhaj heading into the final round could only manage a 70 to finish fourth on 280, one stroke ahead of Talib Hussain, who also carded a 70. Ansar Mehmood finished on 284, a shot ahead of Ahmed Baig, Mohammad Ashfaq and Mohammad Munir.
Minhaj Maqsood, Mohammad Zubair and Matloob Ahmed — with varying performances over the final 18 holes — ended on nine-under 279 in a three-way tie atop the leaderboard at the conclusion of the fourth round of the Rs10million Chairman JCSC Golf Championship here at the Karachi Golf Club.
In the ensuing playoff, the first hole saw Matloob — who’d fired a remarkable six-under 66 to overturn a five-shot deficit on Minhaj overnight — eliminated from the title race. On the second hole, Zubair (67) faltered — his bogey meaning Minhaj (71) could celebrate after he finished the hole with a par.
“It’s an amazing feeling,” Minhaj told Dawn. “You can’t really describe all the emotions going through your head when you win a title in this fashion.”
The 25-year-old has only returned to the Pakistan Golf Federation tour after three years in South Africa where he completed his diploma in professional golf. He showed his promise at last week’s Sindh Governor’s Golf Cup where he finished third behind Pakistan number one Shabbir Iqbal and Matloob. This week, he fulfilled his potential.
Zahid F Ebrahim claimed the gross title in 36-hole senior amateurs’ competition, finishing a shot ahead of Khalid Jamil Siddiqi. Khurram Khan was the net winner.
In other contests, Saim Shazli won the amateurs title with a three-round 214 to finish three strokes ahead of Yashal Shah. Cdre Abdul Rehman was the net winner.
Hamna Amjad came out on top of the 54-hole young ladies event for the World Amateur Golf Rankings. She carded 235, finishing 10 shots ahead of Aania Farooq.
Humera Khalid edged Tabassum Sharif to emerge as the gross winner in the ladies 36-hole event, while Durdana Soomro claimed the net honours.

Sahil, who finished off the frame in his maiden run at the course on Nov 20, was at his best and won hands-down to add another feather to his cap. He clocked one minute, 42 2/5 seconds for the one-mile race.
By virtue of registering this magnificent victory, Sahil has become a leading contender for the Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup which is three weeks away from now.
Bay colt Shorawak, this year’s Derby runner-up, had to be content with third place falling nine lengths behind while Mind of Promise completed the frame another nine lengths away among six starters.
Sahil, who belongs to the stables of Khawaja M. Atif, was sent by trainer Zia-ur-Rehman and efficiently piloted home by ace rider Aftab Chaudhry.
The Colts and Fillies Trial Cup ended in a blaze of glory for favourite dark bay colt Warrior’s Call who registered a facile five lengths win over Fantastico in the seventh race to make it two on trot.
Filly Queens Pride made an impressive debut by winning the Fantastic Face Stakes when she lowered the colours of favourite Thunder Crown by three lengths.
The sixth race saw a mishap as riding boy M. Ramzan received head injuries after falling from his mount Thunder King at two furlongs and was rushed to a nearby hospital. Thunder King who fractured his legs, succumbed to injuries and died instantly.
It is pertinent to mention that Thunder King, who had won seven races in-a-row starting Sept 6 and culminating in the Quaid-e-Azam Gold Cup meeting last year, was incumbent Horse of the Year.
Earlier in Dec 2019, rider Mohammad Nasir had lost his life when he too fell from Thunder King.

4,Masuaku’s late strike helps West Ham stun league leaders Chelsea,LONDON: Chelsea crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at West Ham as Arthur Masuaku’s fortuitous late winner capped the...,"LONDON: Chelsea crashed to a shock 3-2 defeat at West Ham as Arthur Masuaku’s fortuitous late winner capped the Premier League leaders’ second half collapse in a dramatic London derby on Saturday.
Chelsea’s early dominance was rewarded in  the 29th minute when Silva met Mason Mount’s corner with a downwards  header that Fabianski could only push into the net via the far post. 
But their concentration wavered and West Ham were gifted an equaliser five minutes before half-time. 
Jorginho played a suicidal backpass that Mendy scrambled to reach before Bowen. 
As the Senegal keeper tried to dribble around Bowen, he lost control  of the ball and sent the West Ham forward crashing to the turf with a  panicked tackle. 
It was a comedy of errors and Lanzini delivered the punchline as he drove the penalty into the roof of the net. 
Jorginho’s howler came just a week after his woeful control allowed Jadon Sancho to score in the draw with Manchester United. 
“We need to admit we did too many crucial mistakes at the moment. That  cost us points against Manchester United and today as well,” Tuchel  said. 
“If you want a result at this level you have to minimise mistakes. We talked about it before, it’s obviously not helped.” 
Chelsea’s response was instant as a sweeping move put them back in front four minutes later. 
Hakim Ziyech’s majestic long pass picked out Mount, who ran in  behind Ben Johnson to caress a sublime volley past Fabianski from just  inside the area. 
An injury to Havertz on the stroke of half-time meant Romelu Lukaku  was introduced after the interval, but the Belgian was anonymous as he  makes a slow recovery from an ankle injury. 
Heading into the weekend, Chelsea had conceded just six league goals this season -- the lowest amount of any team in the top five European leagues. 
But, missing the injured N’Golo Kante as the midfield shield in  front of them, there was a lack of cohesion at the back for the Blues  and Moyes’ men took advantage to snatch a 56th minute equaliser. 
Vladimir Coufal was able to poke a pass to Bowen on the edge of the area as Chelsea fatally backed off and the forward drilled a superb low strike through Andreas Christensen’s legs and into the far corner. 
It was the first time Chelsea had conceded more than one goal in a Premier League game since May and there was worse to come in the 87th minute. 
When Masuaku took possession and shaped to cross, there seemed little danger for Chelsea, but the defender’s delivery suddenly swerved in mid-air, deceiving Mendy as it arched past the stunned keeper. 
“Truthfully, I didn’t think we played that well, but to get those  goals against a team that don’t concede many is a great credit to the  lads,” Moyes said. 
Defeat meant Chelsea could end the weekend as low as third. For David Moyes’ West Ham, it was another impressive win after also  beating Liverpool 3-2 at home in the league and eliminating both  Manchester clubs from the League Cup. And it ensured the Hammers will  remain in fourth place after this weekend.

Medvedev’s win came after Andrey Rublev had demolished Dominik Koepfer 6-4, 6-0 earlier in Madrid to set up a meeting with the 2018 champions Croatia on Sunday.
World number two Medvedev never looked in serious trouble against Struff, making just six unforced errors and saving the one break point he faced to seal the win in 66 minutes to send Russia to their first Davis Cup final since 2007.Earlier, Rublev smashed down six aces in the first set and world number 58 Koepfer wilted remarkably as the Russian broke at every opportunity in the second to wrap up the opening match in 49 minutes.
Rublev’s ruthless performance was a marked improvement from his quarter-final match against Elias Ymer when he won the first set but missed several break point opportunities in the second and was taken to a decider.With the doubles match now a dead rubber, the Russians replaced Rublev with Karen Khachanov for his first appearance in the tournament to play alongside Aslan Karatsev against Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz.
On Friday, Croatia reached the final after Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic beat Novak Djokovic and Filip Krajinovic 7-5, 6-1 in a decisive doubles clash to give the competition’s twice former winners a 2-1 win over Serbia.
Borna Gojo fired Croatia ahead with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over Dusan Lajovic in the opening rubber before Djokovic redressed the balance as he brushed aside Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-2.

The feature event, the December Cup, a term race for three-year-old thoroughbred colts and fillies, comprises a tiny field of four declared runners, two colts and as many fillies.
All of them are champions in their own right having won one or two races each with a promise for fine performance in the forthcoming semi classic or classic events laid down in the 2021-22 prospectus.
Three of the quartet of runners — colts Mr Gondal and fillies Hassan’s Heights and Widad — have won two races each while colt The Great Shah trained by Shahid Rehman has scored one victory in three outings. The style of his victory in the November Cup over 1400 metres makes the son of famed sire Light Heavy a strong contender with the two fillies as his challengers. Shahid Rehman has so far proved a very clever conditioner of horses known for his thirst for cup races and classic events.
This will be the fourth race in the racing order drawing  high interest among connoisseurs.
The  supporting cup event, the Malik Hamid Ali Noon Memorial Cup, has eleven runners declared after the withdrawals for acceptances will be gone over 1200 metres.
The declared runners are from the top bloodlines of the country’s thoroughbred wealth and  colts and fillies trained by top conditioners whose reputation will be at stake which makes it a close contest.
In all a good number of 65 runners makes the field for seven events, three to be gone over 900 metres,  two over 1100 metre, one over 1200 metres and one over 1600 metres.
The first race will be held at 12:00 noon.

The bad light finally ended play with Babar batting on 60 and Azhar Ali on 36.
Left-arm spinner Taijul Islam (2-49) bowled brilliantly in the morning session to put Bangladesh on top after the visitors seemed headed towards a big score.
Openers Abid Ali and Abdullah Shafique brought up 50-run partnership in the first hour as Babar elected to bat first after winning the toss.
Abid struck the first three boundaries of the day as the Bangladeshi pacers erred their length. Shafique hit the lone six of the day off Taijul to join Abid in lighting up the scoreboard.
But Taijul broke the 59-run partnership, denying the pairs third century-opening stand as his straight delivery rattled the stump of Abdullah on 25.
After his 133 and 91 in the first Test, Abid had appeared set for another big score but fell for 39 when Taijul again struck with a straight delivery that didn’t turn as much as he expected.
Babar and Azhar survived several tricky moments at the outset of their innings, particularly against Taijul.
The hosts could have swung the momentum had Khaled Ahmed not put down a tough chance, offered by Babar on 39 off left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan’s bowling.
Babar then guided a length delivery of off-spinner Mehidy Hasan for a couple to reach his 19th test 50 off 75 balls.
Azhar, meanwhile, looked shaky and was hit on his helmet by a bouncer of pacer Ebadot Hossain. But he continued to bat to accompany Babar in steadying the innings.
Pakistan lead the two-Test series 1-0 after winning the first Test in Chittagong by eight wickets.
The  visitors fielded an unchanged squad from the first Test while  Bangladesh handed Mahmudul Hasan a Test debut and brought in Shakib and Khaled Ahmed in three changes to the team.Saif Hassan, Yasir Ali and Abu Jayed were dropped from the opening Test.—Agencies

10,Ajaz equals 10-for record but India on top in Mumbai Test,MUMBAI: New Zealand’s Mumbai-born spinner Ajaz Patel took a record 10 wickets in an innings but their batsmen...,"MUMBAI: New Zealand’s Mumbai-born spinner Ajaz Patel took a record 10 wickets in an innings but their batsmen collapsed to leave India in control of the second Test here at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday.
Ajaz emulated England’s off-spinner Jim Laker (1956 vs Australia, Old Trafford) and Indian leg-spinner Anil Kumble (1999 vs Pakistan, New Delhi) to complete his perfect 10 in the second session and bowl out India for 325.
But New Zealand’s batsmen collapsed to 62 all out and India were 332 ahead by stumps at the Wankhede Stadium after not enforcing the follow-on and reaching 69 for 0 in their second innings.
First-innings centurion Mayank Agarwal, on 38, and Cheteshwar Pujara, on 29, made to open the innings after Shubman Gill suffered a blow to his elbow while fielding and could not take the field, were batting.
Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin claimed four wickets and fast bowler Mohammed Siraj took three in the New Zealand innings on a day when Ajaz ruled with his left-arm spin.
“Personally I think it’s one of the greatest cricketing days of my life and probably will always be,” Ajaz told reporters.
“From the team perspective it’s obviously tough. But we still have more Test cricket left. We got to make sure we front up tomorrow and scrap as much as we can.
“We are on the backfoot, but we got to come back here tomorrow and make sure we work as hard as possible to see how we can turn this game around or eke out something special.”
Ajaz, who took four wickets on day one including Pujara and skipper Virat Kohli for ducks, rattled India in the first session with wickets in successive balls to be on a hat-trick.
Ajaz sent back Agarwal, who started the day on 120 with India on 221-4, to break a 67-run stand with Axar.
The wily spinner soon got Axar lbw and wrapped up the Indian innings with Siraj his final scalp as the Kiwi players surrounded their hero with hugs and applause.
He sent down 47.5 overs in four spells out of a Kiwi total of 109.5 and bowled almost unchanged on day two.
“Ajaz really bowled well. It was extraordinary bowling by him. My plan was to put pressure on him but unfortunately I got out,” said Siraj, who later returned figures of 3-19 from his four overs.
Ajaz returned figures of 10-119 but Agarwal’s 150 and a 52 by Axar Patel helped India to a challenging total on a turning track.
In the New Zealand innings Siraj, who replaced injured Ishant Sharma in the team, struck early to send back Will Young for four.
He then got two wickets including stand-in skipper Tom Latham for 10, and Ross Taylor, for one, on either side of overs to be on a hat-trick that was avoided by Henry Nicholls.Axar then got Daryl Mitchell out for eight and soon fellow spinner Ashwin joined in to claim Nicholls as the Kiwis slipped further.
Kyle Jamieson top-scored with 17 but none of the Kiwi batsmen survived the bowling onslaught as they went down to the lowest-ever Test score against India by any side.
The previous lowest Test score in India was the home side’s 75 against the West Indies in Delhi in 1987.

11,Pakistan take 11th spot at Hockey Jr World Cup,Former Olympians criticise Pakistan's performance.,"LAHORE: Pakistan earned a poor 11th place in the ongoing FIH Hockey Junior World Cup in Bhubaneswar, India after beating Poland 5-0 in the 11-12 position match on Saturday.
Pakistan scored three goals through penalty-corners and two in field attempts.
Rizwan Ali scored a brace while Rana Wahid, Moin Shakill and Hammad-ud-din chipped in with one goal each.
It was the third victory for Pakistan in their pool. The green-shirts had played three pool matches and could only win one, against Egypt (3-1) while losing to Germany and Argentina.
In position matches of the 16-nation tournament, Pakistan lost to South Africa, before winning against the US and Poland.
Meanwhile, former Olympians  Manzoor-ul-Hasan, Rashid-ul-Hasan, Khalid Bashir, Salim Nazim and Naeem Akhtar criticised  Pakistan’s performance in the World Cup.

12,Justin Langer won’t rule out return for Tim Paine,"""I’m not sure we’ve seen the end of him,"" he says.","BRISBANE: Australia coach Justin Langer has not ruled out a return to international cricket for Tim Paine despite the wicket-keeper resigning from the captaincy following his involvement in a  “sexting” scandal.
Paine threw Australia’s Ashes preparations into turmoil three weeks before the start of the series against England when he quit the role before it was announced he would be taking an indefinite mental health break from the game.
“When I saw him [Paine] he’s obviously shattered with what’s happened because he’s been such an exemplary figure in Australian cricket, for the last four years particularly,” Langer told reporters on Saturday.
“His life’s changed, obviously. He absolutely loves cricket. He’s 37 and he is as fit as any athlete, certainly in our squad and we’ve got some fit athletes here.
“He looks after himself so well, he’s very focused so who knows” if he will return.
“His number one priority at the moment is his family, as you can imagine, and that’s how it should be,” Langer added.
“But I’m not sure we’ve seen the end of him. We’ll wait and see, but that will be his decision.”
While Paine may return in the future, Langer stressed Australia will not allow any distractions to take the attention off the Ashes series, which starts at the Gabba in Brisbane on Wednesday and concludes in mid-January.
