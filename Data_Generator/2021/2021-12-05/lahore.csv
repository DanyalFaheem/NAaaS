0,PPP hopes to pull off NA-133 at PML-N’s ‘home ground’,The top leaders of both the parties have not held a single public meeting in the constituency.,"LAHORE: The opposition PML-N and the PPP are expected to have a good contest on one of Lahore’s key constituencies, NA-133, by-poll here on Sunday (today).
The PML-N expects to bag an ‘easy win’ whereas the PPP has told the Sharifs to be ready for a ‘big upset’. As the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) is out of the contest because of a ‘technical’ issue, the field is open to the PPP to give a ‘tough time’ to the PML-N.
Interestingly, both PML-N and PPP top leaders did not hold a single public meeting in the constituency unlike their past practice in the by-polls. PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz had been active in the by-polls and would address a final rally but she chose not to visit NA-133 constituency this time round.
PPP co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari has been camping in Lahore for the last two weeks but none of its top leaders held a public meeting in the constituency.

Public resentment makes the contest all the more unpredictable

The approach has set the tongues wagging about whether it’s kind of an ‘understanding’ between the two opposition parties not to hold a public meeting in the constituency to be addressed by its top leaders to avoid maligning each other in the absence of the PTI.
Both parties’ focus remained on corner meetings and door-to-door campaigns. The PPP, however, held a few motorcycle rallies in the constituency and appeared a bit aggressive in campaigning for its candidate Aslam Gill.
On the other hand, PML-N candidate Shaista Pervaiz Malik is in ‘Iddat’ and her son MNA Ali Pervaiz Malik spearheaded the campaign.
NA-133 has more than 370,000 registered voters. A visit to some parts of the constituency by this reporter showed that both parties had spent handsome amounts on advertisement campaigns. However, on ground not much enthusiasm of the voters was seen.
“If you ask me, I am not interested in Sunday’s polling after what Imran Khan government has done to us in the form of inflation and joblessness,” Tariq Nazir, a resident of Township, told Dawn. “We are sick of hollow slogans and empty promises of the candidates. Had the PTI candidate been contesting, I would certainly have been voting against him. Now I prefer to stay back home and will not spoil my holiday,” he said.
Saleem Ahmed, a resident of Green Town, said his area had not seen any development for a long time. “The people of my area are not interested in this by-poll because they think that whosoever gets elected, cannot do any good for the constituency since he is from the opposition party,” he said and predicted a low turnout.
The PML-N and PPP have traded allegations of buying votes. The ECP has already ordered a forensic audit of the video clips that went viral on social media in which loyalties of voters were allegedly being bought for Shaista Malik in NA-133.
“Since the PPP stands no chance in this election, it is trying its best to buy the votes,” PML-N Punjab Information Secretary Azma Bokhari alleged. She told Dawn on Saturday that despite such tactics by the PPP, Ms Malik would have an ‘easy win’. Defending the party leaders for not holding a public meeting in the constituency, Ms Bokhari said: “We have not felt the need because the PTI is out of the contest.”
She also claimed that the party had identified 11 people belonging to the PTI who were buying votes, showing themselves as the workers of the PML-N.
PPP leader Usman Malik said it was an open secret now which party was buying votes. “Seeing the aggressive campaign of the PPP, the PML-N set up centres in the constituency where it offered money to voters… and the Election Commission has taken notice of it,” he told Dawn.
Mr Malik further said the PML-N should get ready for a ‘big upset’ on Sunday as the PPP’s candidate had the support of the voters who were sick of the PTI’s anti-people policies. “Besides grabbing the support of the old PPP sympathisers, Mr Gill will secure the votes of the Pakistan Awami Tehreek of Dr Tahirul Qadri, Majlis-e-Wahdatul Muslimeen (MWM) and 70,000 Christians,” he said and added the PML-N’s campaign was hardly seen because of the conflict between Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shehbaz.
For the first time in the tenure of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), only the opposition parties are contesting for any by-poll. The ECP had rejected the nomination papers of former special assistant to the prime minister on food security, Jamshed Iqbal Cheema, and his wife for NA-133 on the grounds that the “proposers and seconders for the two were not residents of the constituency as required under the election laws”.
The opposition says Mr Cheema intentionally did so knowing well about the wrath of the people in the face of inflation and price hike.
The PTI has asked its voters to abstain from voting on NA-133 by-election polling day as the party candidate committed a blunder of not meeting legal requirements.
The seat fell vacant after the death of PML-N’s Lahore president Pervaiz Malik. In the 2018 general election, Pervaiz Malik had defeated PTI Central Punjab President Ejaz Chaudhry with a margin of 12,000 votes.
Meanwhile, the ECP has imposed a fine of Rs50,000 on Aslam Gill for violating the election code of conduct.

Sources close to the owner of the affected factory told Dawn on Saturday that Ijaz Bhatti was in Germany when the incident took place on Friday. He returned to Sialkot on Saturday morning and held meetings with the district police officer and other concerned authorities to discuss the issue.
Those arrested and those on the run face another agony as their families will face financial difficulties. A police official said close circuit television cameras had been installed everywhere in the factory and their footage might help investigators in identifying real culprits.
The garment unit is the leading concern in Sialkot for using latest technology compatible with the Chinese garments industry. It manufactured garments for at least 35 leading brands of clothing across the globe, including Hugo Boss.
As many as 500 workers belonging to Faisalabad, Multan, Sargodha, Vehari and other cities are residing in the factory’s owned labour colony where a hospital is providing them free treatment, free meals and free transport.
Official sources said that foreign nationals belonging to China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Sri Lanka and other countries are holding managerial positions in various factories in Sialkot.
Sources said deceased Sri Lankan manager was a gold medalist in textile engineering and one of his brothers was currently working in a textile mills in Faisalabad.
Punjab secretary for human resource and labour Liaqat Ali Chatha also inspected the factory along with officials of the Sialkot labour department on Friday night.
He also held a meeting with the leadership of various labour unions of Sialkot, asking them to keep calm and help police in maintenance law and order.

4,Inaction on IJT issue: PU complains to CS against police officers,LAHORE: The Punjab University administration on Saturday lodged a complaint to chief secretary about the police...,"LAHORE: The Punjab University administration on Saturday lodged a complaint to chief secretary about the police inaction against the students who vandalised its offices.
A letter, a copy available with Dawn, to the chief secretary by the PU stated that a group of 35 to 40 students, belonging to the IJT, attacked the administration block of the university. They ransacked the offices, including that of the registrar, while chanting slogans. During the incident, the university employees were working in their respective offices.
It added that the group, armed with bricks, wooden sticks and cricket bats, forced their entry into the registrar office and ransacked it. They vandalised other offices too and broke the windowpanes and other property indiscriminately. They also manhandled the university security staff.
The complaint stated that the PU had taken disciplinary action against the culprits; however, a number of miscreants were not the university students and they had come from outside. It added that a letter was also written to the Superintendent of Police Allama Iqbal Town to arrest the culprits, nominated in various FIR, but unfortunately no one was arrested.
It further states that keeping in view gravity and sensitivity of the matter, strict action by the law enforcement agencies was required against those involved in the recent incident as well as those nominated in the earlier FIRs. Otherwise, these dozens of students and their collaborators would keep on destroying the peaceful environment of the university.
Meanwhile, the Muslim Town police on Saturday registered a case against 40 Islami Jamiat Talaba (IJT) activists for vandalising the offices of the vice chancellor, registrar and public relation officer of the PU.
Three activists were nominated in the case while 27 others were unidentified.
PU Registrar Dr Khalid Khan told Dawn the case was registered against the students involved in ransacking the university offices and creating law and order situation on the campus. He said the administration had also initiated disciplinary action against the students and had sent them notices. He said the administration would also approach the parents of the students who would be suspended from attending classes till the final decision of the disciplinary committee.
Model Town SP operation Raza Tanveer confirmed registration of the case but added that no one was arrested yet. He said the nominated students had secured their pre-arrest bail from court and they would be included in the investigation.
An insider, on condition of anonymity, told Dawn the university administration had written to the chief secretary because a senior police officer had held a meeting with the students nominated in various cases and advised them to get pre-arrest bail to avoid their arrest. He said the police officers were not cooperating with the PU administration for taking action against the suspects.

6,"Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry for new SOPs for industry to avoid fanaticism, violence",SCCI president says the scars the lynching left on the export-based industry of Sialkot might take a long time to heal.,"GUJRAT: The business fraternity of Sialkot has decided to formulate new standard operating procedures (SOPs) for production operations in factories to avoid tragic incident like lynching of a Lankan factory manager in future.
Moreover, the export-based companies having foreign nationals among their staff have also been asked to take special security measures for the foreigners, besides training security guards to cope with any such situation in future.
An emergency meeting of the business leaders of Sialkot was held at Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) office on Saturday with SCCI president Mian Imran Akbar in the chair. The meeting was also attended by the chairmen of all the trade and export associations.

 



 
Sources said the meeting participants were worried how they would explain the lynching incident to their foreign customers across the globe, particularly in the western countries.

Especially focuses on security of foreigner employees

SCCI President Mr Akbar told Dawn the scars the Friday incident left on the export-based industry of Sialkot might take a long time to heal. However, he said, the local businessmen were committed to steer the industry out of the situation with some targeted measures and discussed various proposals “that could not be discussed in the media until such measures were in place”.
He said that it was decided in the meeting to arrange lectures of religious scholars and Ulema for counseling of factory workers, sensitizing them about the scantily of human life and teachings of Islam.
Mr Akbar said though he could not share any data about the number of foreigners working in Sialkot-based industry, all the foreigners had been doing office jobs, and none of them was part of manufacturing or working on machines.
Besides, he said the owners of the factories employing foreigners had also been asked to make special security arrangements for such staffers.
To express solidarity with the whole Sri Lankan nation and the family of the deceased, Priyantha Diyawadan, a condolence reference was also organised at the SCCI.
It is learnt that some businessmen have suggested to the SCCI and trade associations to not allow display of any kind of religious material etc inside the factories’ work stations and offices to avoid such a situation in future.
Speaking at the reference, the SCCI president said the incident did not represent the industry’s usual environment, neither it defines the people of Sialkot. He hoped the exports-based city would rise from this and would continue to portray a positive image of Pakistan.
He said the SCCI condemned the barbaric act of violence resulting in tragic death of a Sri Lankan citizen working in Pakistan, urging the government and the law enforcement agencies to crackdown on all the perpetrators and inciters involved in the ugly incident and bring them to justice.
Expressing solidarity with the bereaved family, he said December 03, 2021, would go down as a dark day in the history of Sialkot that always showed tolerance and religious harmony.
Mr Akbar said there was no place for fanaticism and violence in society and that the miscreants involved in such wicked acts did not belong to any religion, caste, or creed.
He said late Diyawadana was a thorough professional known for his stern production standards and that the personal vendetta on part of some labourers in the garb of “religious sentiments” led to his lynching.

7,"Harking Back: Of drawbridges, moats, walls and a garden at the brink","Just why did old Lahore have walls, why did it once have a moat surrounding it, what happened to its drawbridges, ...","Just why did old Lahore have walls, why did it once have a moat surrounding it, what happened to its drawbridges, and what has happened to the garden surrounding it. It remains an unfolding tragedy to our heritage.
As a child my father, who knew a thing or two about the old walled city and its people, told us about the drawbridge outside Mochi Gate that was pulled up every evening at sunset. Sounds antique stuff, but the official record tells us that the Mochi Gate drawbridge was dismantled in 1931 because the city outside had expanded enough to make it ‘irrelevant’, because people now moved about even at night.
In this piece let us have a look at why the moat was dismantled, what happened to the drawbridge, what is happening to the garden and just why the walls surrounding the city do not interest our heritage officials. These four elements of old Lahore life had a meaning to the way people lived, safely. So first let us have a brief look at the moat.
Before the era of heavy guns and cannons, the most efficient way of stopping invaders was a moat surrounding the fort and the city. As then the River Ravi flowed around the fort and the city the strategy was to have a rough ‘maidan’ or ground beyond the river. In traditional parlance it was known as ‘rahra maidan’. Even today this usage is in practice. Beyond the ‘maidan’ was a mud barrier or a ‘ghatti’ which prevented wheeled carriages from reaching the ‘maidan’.
So an invading force had to first counter the ‘ghatti’, then face arrows flying onto the ‘maidan’, then came the river, and then an open ground before the city and fort walls. At the gateways the drawbridges were pulled up and then it was a matter of just how much damage the offensive force could face and for how long. In the markets it was a royal decree that a year-long supply of food grain was always in store.
Then two major developments changed life in Lahore. The most important was that the River Ravi meandered westwards initially to where today is the ‘Buddha Ravi’ and then to near its present position a mile from old Lahore. So in place of the river a moat came about. This was formalised by the Sikh ruler Maharajah Ranjit Singh. But more about that later.
The second major development was the invention of the cannon, which made fort walls partially irrelevant given sufficiently powerful explosions. That stage came much later. The first invader to test cannons against the strong mud walls of the fort and the city was the Mughal ruler Babar. He managed to decimate the mud walls with considerable ease.
The moat around the city was strengthened by the Sikh ruler, who also raised the wall height by almost 10 feet, or ’12 chappay’ as the record tells us. The drawbridges operated at three gateways and a constabulary monitored human movement, with the maharajah immediately informed of any new entrant.
By the time the British captured Lahore in 1849, the moat had dried because it was not properly replenished from the Buddha Ravi near the fort’s Roshnai Gate where boats arrived. Mind you highways had not become a major consideration till then.
After 1857 the British were of the opinion that moats and walls meant that the local population could at any stage raise a siege. So they undertook two major undertakings. First, they demolished the southern portion of the walls of the Lahore Fort and replaced it with a sliding entrance, one that can still be seen. Secondly, they knocked down portions of the eastern and southern walls at five different places. This allowed British troops to enter the city and the fort with ease in case of a siege and/or rebellion.
They also filled up the empty dry moat and built a beautiful garden surrounding the old city further surrounded by a ring road called Circular Road. The garden was where the population of the old city went for walks and beyond at the old Parade Ground of the East India Company renamed Minto Park by the British, and again renamed as Iqbal Park after 1947. Cricket clubs emerged, the most famous being Crescent and Mamdot. Sadly, that park is now a showpiece park and the clubs have all been shut down.
Now back to the story of the walls that surrounded the old city. For centuries, probably for 3,000 years of known history, the walls of the fort were made of mud. The technology of making mud fort is ancient and can be seen, to some extent, at Harappa and Mohenjo Daro and also Taxila. Given the Indian archaeologists claim about nearby Rakhigarhi and its mud fort walls, surely Lahore Fort by this conjecture would be older.
The huge mud clay bricks with sand, chalk, straw and stone that made up a Mud Fort had several wall layers. It was normal for them to be at least over 30 feet thick. The outer layer was plastered four times a year, making them always look neat and clean. Experts on the subject claim that they were as strong as a 10 feet thick brick wall. However, rain was the only thing that weakened them, and hence the constant attention.
Come the rule of the Mughal emperor Akbar, we see that Lahore and the Punjab faced a major famine in 1574 that went on for three years. With heavy taxation on farmers while the Mughals became rich the people started starving and to appease them he set up a meal-a-day kitchen for 25,000 people on the condition that they bake bricks and build the Lahore fort and old city. Given a rebellion by Rajputs he sought assistance from Turkmen cavalry and housed them to the east and appeased Rajputs to the west in an expanded Lahore.
The old graveyards in the old ‘maidan’ now came within the new expanded Lahore walled city, with one example being the grave of Ayaz, the Georgian slave of Mahmud the invader from Ghazni. Hence the new walled city came about.
But then the Partition of 1947 saw large-scale destruction and a new trading class from the eastern Punjab cities moved in, stealing bricks from the destroyed walls for their new construction. As traders occupied over half of Lahore’s residential area, the law simply ceased to apply, a situation that still exists. Walls hinder the movement of trade, and for this specific reason the walls of the old ‘once walled’ city are not reconstructed. The bureaucrats in power continue to follow the wishes of the traders.
In a way the old Lahore remains under siege of the trader-bureaucratic combine. The proof of this is for all to see in that monuments of interest are being redone to show performance, while the houses of the poor continue to decay. The media is filled with performance stories of showpiece restoration of monuments.
So we see the beautiful British-era gardens now full of garbage, illegal shops and buildings and every commercial use possible. No one in power dare to remove them. It is a matter of a few years when the complete destruction of old Lahore’s gardens and walls, what to speak of old houses being allowed to fall and a new trader illegally paying his way through. The law exists on paper. The bureaucrats remain paper tigers.

8,Essence of Lahore streets on a plate,"What’s good street food that’s not relished on a roadside, and Pakistanis have a special place for such snacks...","


 
What’s good street food that’s not relished on a roadside, and Pakistanis have a special place for such snacks that define their culture and lifestyle.
Muhammad Haroon, 57, started selling gol gappay on a pushcart 30 years ago in Bilal Gunj and five years later introduced laddu peethi also – the two most popular and the quintessential street snacks. A few years into the business he rented his first shop inside Garhi Shahu’s main bazaar, followed by one on the main road in the same town just six years ago and a third near the iconic Shalamar Gardens.
A foreman at a steel factory, Haroon turned to food on the suggestion of his father-in-law who was in this business. “I followed his advice as I knew I could make more money from it.”
Summer or winter, day or night, gol gappay are a favourite across the Indian subcontinent and their popularity surpasses social class and age. Many restaurants have introduced this roadside delicacy on their menu, but gol gappay – that as per legend are said to have originated in India’s Uttar Pradesh around the time of Emperor Shahjehan’s reign -- are an experience that’s best had along a street or in a busy bazaar devoid of the sophistication of dining tables.
Part of the experience is watching a vendor prepare plates moving his hands mechanically across bowls of chickpeas, and in some cases spiced potato and phulki, and the earthen pitcher (gharra) full of spicy, sour water. He pokes a little hole in the crisp, hollow, thin puri (fried discs of dough), packs it with your choice of filling and presents it to you to dunk it in the spicy water and pop into your mouth before it bursts. There’s a method and precision to be followed in devouring this snack the correct way.
Laddu peethi although equally traditional is a little underrated, and has yet to be mainstreamed the way its contemporaries dahi bhallay, gol gappay and various chaats have been. It comprises a fried patty that’s crunchy on the outside and soft and airy inside made with assorted daals, sprinkled with julienned white radish and served with sweet and sour chutneys.
Haroon used to make the gol gappay at home in the beginning and only introduced laddu later for winters only, but now he says the laddu are more popular. “I make the khatta water myself daily after reciting Bismillah and Darood Sharif because of which I believe it doesn’t affect the throat, rather treats it,” a contented Haroon tells Dawn at the Garhi Shahi main road shop, called Molvi Gol Gappay and Laddu Peethi.



 
“Since I can’t meet the growing demand and have to manage 50 workers in all three shops, I get the gol gappay prepared by a home-based business in Dharampura.”
The perfect gol gappa despite containing imli (tamarind), mint juice, black pepper, cumin, ajwain (carom seeds) among other ingredients is the one that doesn’t affect the throat, he adds. A plate of a dozen gol gappay is sold for Rs180.
The laddus are prepared by soaking channa, maash and moong daals in water for around seven hours that are then mashed through a machine, salt and ammonia added and fried in fresh oil. They are accompanied by apricot and imli chutneys and a raita, while most vendors only offer the two chutneys. Fresh batches of laddus are fried thrice a day and a pair sold for Rs100.
During the first lockdown last year, Haroon says he paid all his workers from his pocket and didn’t let any of them go despite the shops being shut. “I lost around Rs1.5 million in those two months, but I didn’t stop paying anyone because most of them depended on this salary,” says the burly middle-aged man, sporting a beard and a skull cap.
We met way past midnight, yet customers were sauntering in almost every minute, most of them families, into the large courtyard at the rear side of the shop. Haroon claims to have a loyal customer base with the daily footfall being at least 600 to 700 people -- some of them visiting since they were kids.
“In the early ‘80s, a dozen gol gappay cost Rs2 and a pair of laddus Re1,” he reminisces.
All three branches of Molvi Gol Gappay and Laddu Peethi, open from 3pm to 2am, are managed by Haroon’s sons and he visits each for a couple of hours only to oversee.
Inflation and the rising prices of essential items have hurt businesses and Haroon has felt the pinch too. “There has been a lot of difficulty since this government came to power. A canister of oil I bought for Rs2,200 is now sold for Rs5,300 and a sack of apricots I’d get for Rs6,000 is now four sacks for Rs96,000. The price of sugar has also doubled in the past one year. Because of these reasons the footfall has decreased otherwise from evening till night we’d be out of space.”
Until two weeks ago, Haroon discloses, just the shop we sat at was making Rs150,000 daily, but now the maximum sale is Rs80,000. He cites dengue, TLP’s sit-ins and inflation as the reasons affecting the business. “Even I voted for Imran Khan, but since he came to power, everybody is suffering, nobody is happy. Taxes have been imposed on everything, electricity rates have increased, oil is expensive,” he complains.
However, he is hopeful, ‘this too shall pass’. “Darkness is always followed by light. Every difficult phase passes.”

The four victims were identified as Rabiya (23), her husband Israr Murtaza, her sister Zainab (21) and her husband Numan.
Police said a four-year-old son of Rabiya cried for help from the window of the apartment, seeking food and milk from a passing-by neighbour woman. On being asked, he told the woman that his mother was asleep.
The woman tried to open the door, which was locked from inside. She called the police helpline.
Police and Rescue 1122 broke the door open to find four people lying dead in a pool of blood.
Police said the incident had occurred on the Thursday night and it surfaced on Saturday when the minor boy sought help. They said Israr, a native of village Mohri Sharif, was residing in the apartment with his wife, Rabiya, and a minor son whereas Zainab, his sister-in-law, had come there after getting estranged from her husband, Numan, a resident of village Khambi of Sara-i-Alamgir.
Sources in police said the initial investigation had suggested that Numan might have visited his estranged wife to take her back and a fight might have occurred there. They suspect in anger killed his wife, her sister and brother-in-law before committing suicide. However, further investigation would determine the facts.
Police shifted the bodies to hospital in Kharian for autopsy and registered a case against unidentified suspects on the report of the mother of the deceased women.

In this case, Ms Shafi already withdrew an application to the extent of her cross-examination through video link as she was available in Pakistan.
Her counsel informed the court in writing that she was willing to present herself physically from Dec 16 till 20 in hope that her cross-examination would be completed by the counsel for Zafar within such time. However, she would press for video link recording of cross-examination of her husband as he was currently in Canada and attending to the defendant and his children.
In his suit, Zafar said the allegations tarnished his image in public and his family had been facing agony and pain. He asked the court to issue a decree against Shafi and direct her to pay Rs1bn as damages to him.

12,Hailey College cancels admission of three students,PU admin claims that the students submitted fake documents.,"LAHORE: The Punjab University’s Hailey College of Commerce has cancelled the admission of three students belonging to Sindh for not being eligible to apply and submitting fake academic certificates.
Eight students of various areas of Sindh had secured admissions for the Fall-2021 semester in BS disciplines of the Punjab University. However, admissions of Kashif Hussain, Babar Hussain and Aamir Ali were cancelled.
A notification of cancellation of the admission states that the admission of three students has been cancelled on the basis of incorrect and incomplete information they have provided in their admission forms.
PU Registrar Dr Khalid Khan said the students had provided fake credentials in their admission forms and the administration cancelled their registration in bachelor classes.

PU admin claims that students submitted fake documents

He said Nov 8 was the last date for submission of forms for admissions at the Punjab University and the students who received their intermediate results were eligible to apply but these three students had filled the admission form with fake marks and submitted these.
He said the students got admissions on the basis of fake entries of their educational credentials and the officials launched an investigation and found that the Sindh Intermediate and Secondary Education Board had announced the results of intermediate classes after Nov 20.
He said these students were not eligible to apply for admissions and also gave fake academic credentials.
Mr Khan said those who got admissions had submitted results of last year (2020) and they were eligible to apply and also got admissions.
He said the three students were not eligible to apply as their result was awaiting and another reason for cancelling admissions was providing fake credentials.
“We could launch a criminal case for providing fake credentials,” he concluded.

13,Workers convention mulls general strike to fight inflation,"LAHORE: Workers, students, peasants and trade union leaders from public and private enterprises across Pakistan...","LAHORE: Workers, students, peasants and trade union leaders from public and private enterprises across Pakistan gathered at the “Central Workers Convention” organised by the Red Workers Front (RWF) at Bakhtiar Hall on Nisbat Road on Saturday and agreed upon waging a countrywide general strike to end inflation, unemployment and privatisation.
The participants expressed their concern over the steady decline of living standards of the working class and said it was a failure of capitalism.
“Mazdoor ki ujrat kitni ho - aik tola sonay jitni ho” and other slogans continued with brief intervals during the five-hour long event at the hall.
“Determine minimum wages of a worker as price of one tola gold,” hundreds of participants said in a resolution.
Finance Secretary Adeel Zaidi said they had demanded fixing wages with the price of gold because unfortunately the wages were not raised according to the rate of inflation. He said the working class was affected by inflation and the elite was the beneficiary.
“The price of gold can serve as a matrix to strike a balance between rise in wages and the rise in inflation,” he said.
“This government does not have the capacity to pose a solution to any labour class issue,” said Anam Khan, a labour rights activist from Karachi.
“This is the organic crisis of capitalism,” she said.
However, the beneficiaries of the system in a bid to shift blame are holding only one person responsible. In order to deliver the working class to save humanity, there is a need to uproot this system.
RWF President Aftab Ashraf said the working class in Pakistan for a long period of time had worked peacefully for their rights. However, no ruler, whether civilian or military, or political party or bureaucrat proved a friend or a sympathiser.
Karim Parhar, a labour leader from Balochistan, shared the details of an ongoing movement of residents of Gwadar for their rights.
The participants expressed their solidarity with Gwadar workers. The workers and students also conducted a rally on Nisbat Road after the convention.

16,"Shehbaz terms PTI govt ‘most corrupt, incompetent’",LAHORE: PML-N President and opposition leader in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif has said claims of the ...,"LAHORE: PML-N President and opposition leader in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif has said claims of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government being honest and transparent “is the biggest lie in the history of Pakistan”.
“The PTI government is the most incompetent, corrupt, laid-back and inexperienced government in the country’s history. The entire nation is suffering because a selected, illegal government was formed as a result of rigged elections in 2018,” Shehbaz told a presser here on Saturday.
Condemning the lynching of a Sri Lankan national in Sialkot, he said the PTI had been exploiting religious issues surfacing during the PML-N government for political gains, but his party always desisted from such tactics.
Pakistan enjoyed good relations with Sri Lanka, he said, hoping the culprits committing this horrific crime would be punished according to law.
The opposition leader said the countries that repeated blunders lost their sovereignty and when they faced economic disasters, it was virtually impossible to save them. He quoted the examples of the Ottoman Empire and the Soviet Union, saying when their economies collapsed even their military might could not save them. He warned if Pakistan did not address the economic crisis it currently faced, it could jeopardise the country.
“The economic blunders committed by the PTI government over the past three years had shaken the very foundations of Pakistan. Inflation and unemployment are threatening the very existence of Pakistan,” he said, regretting Pakistan was now ranked third in the world and first in South Asia for its high inflation rate.
He said the IMF conditions had choked the entire nation, while neighbouring India had not asked the IMF for help since 1991.
He said Nawaz left the country with 5.8 per cent GDP growth, while the PTI after three years of its rule could managed only 3.5per cent.
“In 2018 the total debt was around Rs30,000 billion, but the PTI added Rs20,000bn to this debt,” he lamented.
Shehbaz said the report of the Loan Commission that included security agencies like ISI, FIA and IB was still pending because it failed to dig out any irregularity by Nawaz government.
He said the government was now going to impose Rs4 Petroleum Development Levy every month and would re-impose sales tax which would further burden the Pakistanis.
To a question, he said the Dec 6 meeting of the joint opposition would decide the fate of the proposed long march on Islamabad.
