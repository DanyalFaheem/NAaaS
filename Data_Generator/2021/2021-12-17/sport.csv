Uncertainty had been building overnight when news outlets in the Caribbean first reported that a few West Indies players had contracted coronavirus. That news was confirmed early Thursday morning and only four hours before the game’s scheduled start it was finally confirmed that it would go ahead.
Having elected to bat, captain Nicholas Pooran’s 64 off 37 deliveries and good innings from openers Brandon King and Shamarh Brooks gave the West Indies hope of a consolation victory and — from what eventually transpired — a first victory on the tour as they amassed 207-3.
However, this Pakistan team is riding the crest of a wave at the moment. And with captain Babar Azam (79) and the prolific Mohammad Rizwan (87) leading from the front, they extinguished West Indies’ hopes very quickly with an opening stand of 158 that powered Pakistan to their highest-ever run chase in T20s with seven balls to spare.
The series triumph marked a second successive clean sweep for Pakistan following a 3-0 win in Bangladesh last month.
For the West Indies, the game marked the end of their current tour with an announcement coming midway through the match that the three-match ODI rubber between the two teams beginning from the weekend had been postponed until next year due to the Covid-19 cases.
Having seen New Zealand abandon their tour due to security concerns and England withdrawing their team from their scheduled trip due to mental health concerns earlier this year, Covid-19 has now robbed Pakistan of the chance to host West Indies for their full tour.
“It was very tough to play today,” Pooran said after the match. “We hadn’t slept all night from everything that had been happening. But I’m proud of how we came out and performed.”
Amid all the drama that had preceded the start of the game, Pooran was understandably shaken at the toss. He couldn’t even remember the changes made to the squad, saying there were three, while the team sheets showed only two.
At daybreak, Cricket West Indies had announced five more members of the team, including three players, had returned positive in the latest round of testing for Covid-19.
The players were wicket-keeper Shai Hope, also the skipper of the ODI team, left-arm spinner Akeal Hosein, arguably their best bowler in the already-lost series, and all-rounder Justin Greaves, a member of the ODI party. Assistant coach Roddy Estwick and physician Akshai Mansingh were also found to be positive after Wednesday’s tests.
They joined fast bowler Sheldon Cottrell, all-rounders Roston Chase and Kyle Mayers and support staff member — who had tested positive earlier — in a 10-day isolation or until they turned negative tests, further depleting a West Indies squad which had seen batter Devon Smith sustain a finger injury in the first T20 and had arrived in Pakistan short of their top players due to injury or otherwise.
The latest positives had sparked fears of a Covid outbreak in the team and players were reluctant in going ahead with the tour with concerns that further cases would see the West Indies players missing out on flying back home in time for Christmas. The ODI series was set to conclude on Dec 22.
It took a series of meetings between the CWI and the Pakistan Cricket Board before it was announced by the latter that the match was going ahead as scheduled.
Once the match began, it rained fours and sixes.
King, fresh from a match-high 67 in his side’s nine-run loss in the second T20, lifted Mohammad Nawaz over mid-wicket for four with his top-hand on the third ball of the West Indies’ innings and then cut the spinner-away for another boundary off the fourth.
He then pulled away Mohammad Hasnain, one of two changes for Pakistan alongside Shahnawaz Dahani, for four in the very next over.  
King’s opening partner Shamarh Brooks got on the act in the third over by Nawaz, hitting him down the ground for four on the second ball. It set the momentum for the over with King hitting a massive six down mid-wicket on the fourth and then cutting away successive boundaries on the last two deliveries.
Another two boundaries followed for King in Hasnain’s second over and West Indies were racing away as they took Mohammad Wasim Jr to the sword in the sixth over.
First Brooks hit him over square leg for six before King’s stupendous pull landed on the roof of the stadium.
Wasim, though, had the last laugh, uprooting his off-stump with the final delivery of the over.
King made 43 off 20 deliveries, with West Indies making 66 in the powerplay overs.
Brooks got a slice of luck in the eighth over when both Iftikhar Ahmed and Hasnain got into a mix-up trying to take his catch, with the ball being missed by both.
And he made Pakistan pay for the let-off, hitting Shadab Khan for three sixes in the ninth over; the first over long on, the second over deep square leg and the third over long off.
Pakistan needed to stem the flow of runs and Dahani responded, having Brooks caught by Iftikhar for a 31-ball 49.
Pooran had been playing second fiddle to Brooks but came to the fore following his dismissal and was only dealing in sixes. He lifted Iftikhar for two in his only over and then hit a full toss by Wasim for another six before pulling Hasnain.
Darren Bravo, originally named for the ODIs but playing the match due to the Covid-enforced absences, was dropped on three and 11 before he pulled away Shadab for four and the West Indies were coasting.
Pooran got the first four of his innings when he hit Hasnain one-bounce at long-off before hitting him for six over square and soon completed his half-century.
He got another four and a six in the 18th over before departing when he was caught by Nawaz at long-on with the West Indies at 194.
Pakistan somewhat controlled the flow of runs in the last two overs, conceding just 13 with Bravo ending on 34 not out.
“They were very good in the last two overs,” admitted Pooran afterwards. “I think we were 30 runs short on this pitch.”
Their batsmen having put a big total on the board, the West Indies now needed their bowlers to deliver.
They almost had their moment on the first ball of the Pakistan innings. Debutant Gudakesh Motie’s strong appeal for a lbw decision against Rizwan was given the nod by umpire Rashid Riaz. But Rizwan immediately reviewed and survived.
From then on, there was no stopping Pakistan as Babar and Rizwan, knowing they had to score quickly, hit the West Indies to all parts of the ground.
“We knew we had a target to chase, and that we needed to start just like West Indies did,” man-of-the-match Rizwan said after the match. 
By the time Babar eventually fell on the first ball of the 16th over, after hitting nine fours and two sixes in his 53-ball innings, Pakistan were well on their way to victory.
Rizwan completed a 12th half century in this calendar year, where he racked up a record 1,326 runs at a sparkling average of 73.66, and hit three sixes and 10 boundaries. When he was dismissed, Pakistan needed 24 runs off 16 deliveries.
Fakhar Zaman (12) followed soon after but Asif Ali, who had scores of one and seven in the opening two games, finally showed the power-hitting prowess a sizeable crowd had come to see, hitting two sixes and two fours to take Pakistan over the line.
Unfortunately, though, there will be no more international cricket in Pakistan until Australia tour in March.

1,"Labuschagne, Warner put Aussies  in control on first day of second Ashes Test",The visitors came into the day-night Adelaide Test on the back of a nine-wicket mauling in Brisbane.,"ADELAIDE: Marnus Labuschagne and David Warner both ground out gritty 95s as Australia seized control of the second Ashes Test on Thursday, surviving an onslaught from veteran English seamers Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.
The visitors came into the day-night Adelaide Test on the back of a nine-wicket mauling in Brisbane but confident they could get back into the five-match series.
But even with the greatest wicket-takers in English history back in the side, they struggled to make inroads with the pink ball as the home team compiled 221 for two by the close.
The tourists did snare an early breakthrough with Broad getting Marcus Harris for three, before Warner and Labuschagne put on 172 for the second wicket.
Warner looked destined for his 25th Test century as he began to open his bat, but fell in the nervous 90s for the second Test in a row, caught by Broad off Ben Stokes.
Labuschagne almost did the same, also on 95, when wicket-keeper Jos Buttler dropped a sitter off Anderson — much to the delight of the partisan crowd.
“There’s a bit of disbelief -- it is my job to capitalise on that now, I gave him a chance... I’ve got to make sure tomorrow no chances,” Labuschagne, who rode his luck more than once, said of Buttler’s costly mistake.
Labuschagne hung on to the close of play, surviving 275 balls to remain unbeaten, while Steve Smith -- captaining the team in the absence of Cummins -- was 18 not out in front of 32,328 fans.
Broad took 1-34 while Anderson bowled a very tidy 18 overs for 29.
“I thought we stuck at it well but they played particularly well in the first two sessions,” said England assistant coach Graham Thorpe.
“But we would have obviously loved to have more wickets down. It’s not a case of feeling sorry for ourselves, we just need to do very similar things tomorrow,” he added.
Cummins out over Covid scare
A consolation for England is that the world’s premier Test bowler,  Australia skipper Pat Cummins, was ruled out less than three hours before the start over a Covid scare.
There was drama before a ball was even bowled. Cummins was at a restaurant on Wednesday evening when a person at the neighbouring table was identified as positive for coronavirus.
Cummins returned a negative test but under South Australia state’s strict bio-security rules he must now isolate for seven days.
“Super frustrating but Covid has thrown us all some curve balls over the last couple of years. Will be cheering along!” he tweeted as the match began.
Fellow quick Josh Hazlewood is also missing, injured, leaving Australia with the inexperienced Jhye Richardson and Michael Neser to spearhead the attack with seasoned campaigners Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon.
Smith took over the captaincy for the first time since being axed over the  “Sandpaper-gate” ball-tampering scandal in 2018. He won the toss and opted to bat.
“It’s a huge honour,” Smith said after the toss. It’s been pretty interesting morning.
Cricket  Australia chief executive Nick Hockley said Cummins hadn’t breached any  protocols by dining out and was unlucky to miss the game.
“We don’t  want to completely lock down the players,” Hockley said. “I think we  struck a balance, we always know that there’s a level of risk. We’ve learnt over the last 18 months that can have other consequences in terms of mental health and well-being.”
England controversially left out Anderson and Broad, who had 1,156 Test wickets between them, from their heavy defeat in Brisbane.
But they returned at the expense of Mark Wood and spinner Jack Leach, bowling in tandem once more in a fiery opening spell.
Their accuracy restricted Australia in an attritional first session to just 45 runs, where Harris fell.
The opener never looked comfortable and after surviving an lbw review then fluffed a pull shot off Broad — who was making his 150th Test appearance — that wicket-keeper Buttler took with a flying catch.
The headband-wearing Broad accounted for Warner seven times on a horror Ashes tour of England in 2019 and he made a massive, but unsuccessful, appeal for lbw on his first ball to the 35-year-old Warner, who was nursing bruised ribs.
The usually flamboyant Warner dug in, surviving two reviews.
With Labuschagne at the other end they picked off runs and accelerated the pace as the day wore on.
Warner reached his 50 and then turned on the style, but as he eyed another Test ton he thrashed at a wide Stokes delivery and sent the ball straight to Broad at cover.
Labuschagne struggled early and was dropped by Buttler for the first time on 21, while Stokes missed a chance when he was on 45. But he made the most of his fortune and will be eyeing a big score Friday.

3,"Ombudsman finds Smith, Boucher and De Villiers showed racial prejudice",CSA board chairman Lawson Naidoo said the board would study the report and would  “engage with it and its recommendations”.,"JOHANNESBURG: South African cricket legends Graeme Smith, Mark Boucher and A.B. de Villiers were all found to have engaged in racially prejudiced conduct in a report by an independent ombudsman released on Wednesday.
Cricket South Africa (CSA) made public a 235-page interim report by Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza, who headed a Social Justice and Nation Building Commission to investigate allegations of racial discrimination in South African cricket.
CSA board chairman Lawson Naidoo said the board would study the report and would  “engage with it and its recommendations”.
Ntsebeza found that former Test captain Smith’s appointment as CSA’s director of cricket was irregular, although he did not attribute this to racial discrimination.
But he was critical of Smith’s decision to appoint Boucher as head coach of the national team ahead of Enoch Nkwe, a black coach who served briefly as national team director, which he found was not in accordance with the organisation’s human resources policy.
“Mr Smith and CSA failed to rebut the presumption of unfair discrimination in the appointment of Mr Boucher ahead of Mr Nkwe,” according to the report.
Smith was also accused of racial discrimination, along with other CSA and team officials, when he was captain of the Test team in England in 2012.
Following an injury to Boucher, leading batsman De Villiers was selected as wicket-keeper ahead of Thami Tsolekile, a specialist wicket-keeper.
“The [ombudsman] is persuaded by the argument that CSA, its coaches and selectors unfairly disadvantaged against Mr Tsolekile on the basis of his race.”
De Villiers was also found to have resisted the selection of Khaya Zondo, a black batsman, when he was South Africa’s One-day International captain ahead of a series-deciding match in India in 2015.
Dean Elgar, a late replacement for the one-day games, was picked ahead of Zondo, who was part of the original squad for the series.
“The only reasonable conclusion is that Mr De Villiers discriminated against Mr Zondo on racial grounds.”
De Villiers, who announced his retirement from cricket last month, responded on social media.
“I have wholly supported the aims of Cricket South Africa’s Social Justice and Nation Building process, to ensure equal opportunities in our game,” he wrote on Instagram and Twitter.
“However, throughout my career, I expressed honest cricketing opinions only ever based on what I believed was best for the team, never based on anyone’s race.”
Boucher was accused by former team-mate Paul Adams of leading a song in after-match fines meetings in which Adams was referred to as a  “brown sh**”.
The ombudsman found that Boucher revealed a  “lack of sensitivity and understanding of the racist undertones,” and that Boucher attempted to excuse racism because it was done in a team setting and that he does  “not comprehend the South African apartheid/discriminatory and racist history.”
Naidoo said in a CSA press release that:  “We are thus committed to considering the findings and recommendations with an open mind. We will look at the report objectively, having regard to our social justice obligations, and our duties as guardians of the game.”
Ntsebeza noted that the commission was  “under-resourced” and  “operated under extreme strictures of time”. He recommended that the CSA appointed a permanent transformation ombudsman.

4,Arsenal thrive despite Aubameyang row as EPL’s Covid crisis deepens,Arsenal are one point above fifth-placed West Ham after a second successive victory.,"LONDON: Arsenal showed they can thrive without axed star Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang as the Gunners moved into fourth place in the Premier League with a 2-0 win against West Ham, while the top-flight’s coronavirus crisis deepened on Wednesday.
Gabriel Martinelli and Emile Smith Rowe netted in the second half of a fiery London derby at the Emirates Stadium that saw West Ham’s Vladimir Coufal sent off.
Arsenal are one point above fifth-placed West Ham after a second successive victory eased the drama surrounding Mikel Arteta’s decision to strip Gabon forward Aubameyang of the club captaincy.
Arteta’s side are in the top four at this stage of a season for the first time in two-and-a-half years.
It is a remarkable reversal of fortune after Arsenal lost their opening three league games for the first time in 67 years.
“It was a statement result. The performance, attitude and commitment the players showed is exactly what we are about,” Arteta said.
“We have a leadership group and I expect every player to stick to our values.” Calls for Arteta to be sacked were widespread after an embarrassing 5-0 thrashing at Manchester City in August, but the Spaniard has steadied the ship impressively, with even the Aubameyang drama unable to derail him.
Aubameyang was absent from the squad after being removed from the captaincy due to a disciplinary breach on Tuesday.
He returned late and missed training last week after travelling to France to see his ill mother.
It was not Aubameyang’s first transgression, having previously been dropped for the north London derby against Tottenham in March after what was described as a breach of the club’s pre-match protocol.
Asked if there was a way back from exile for Aubameyang, Arteta said:  “We will talk about that another day.
“He was not eligible for this game, that’s it and this game is gone now. We will discuss it in the near future.” Martinelli broke West Ham’s resistance in the 48th minute when the Brazilian ran onto Alexandre Lacazette’s defence-splitting pass and stroked a fine finish into the far corner for his second goal this term.
West Ham were reduced to 10 men in the 66th minute after Coufal’s tackle on stand-in skipper Lacazette conceded a penalty and earned the defender a second yellow card.
Lukasz Fabianski plunged to his left to save Lacazette’s spot-kick, but Smith Rowe capped Arsenal’s dominant display when he finished a flowing move with a clinical strike from the edge of the area in the 87th minute.
Covid chaos
While Arsenal were hit by the coronavirus before their opening game of the season at Brentford, they have so far avoided the recent positive test plunging the league into turmoil.
Watford’s match at Burnley was postponed less than three hours before kick-off on Wednesday after  “an ongoing Covid outbreak” left the Hornets with insufficient players to fulfill the fixture.
It was the third Premier League game to be postponed due to Covid in four days as the new Omicron variant causes havoc in England’s top-flight.
Tottenham’s trip to Brighton last Sunday was called off due to an outbreak at the north London club, while Manchester United’s match at Brentford on Tuesday was cancelled after the Old Trafford club’s positive tests.
United, Tottenham, Brighton, Leicester, Norwich and Aston Villa had already been hit by the virus over the last week.
The Premier League announced a record 42 positive tests across two testing cycles last week.
Brighton boss Graham Potter had dealt with several Covid cases in his squad this week and his problems mounted as Wolves won 1-0 at the Amex Stadium.
Potter’s side are without a win in 12 games in all competitions after Romain Saiss volleyed home in first half stoppage-time.
Jordan Ayew ended his 47-game goal drought to give Crystal Palace a 2-2 draw against Southampton at Selhurst Park.

6,"Novak Djokovic, Ash Barty crowned ITF world champions","“After such a rewarding year for me, my team, it is a great honour to be named the ITF World Champion,"" says Djokovic.","LONDON: Men’s world number one Novak Djokovic has been named the 2021 ITF world champion for a record seventh time while women’s number one Ash Barty has picked up her second crown, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said on Thursday.
Djokovic, who finished the year as number one for a record seventh time, won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon while he fell short at the Tokyo Olympics and the US Open final in his quest for a rare golden slam.
The Serb was tied with American great Pete Sampras on six wins for the title first awarded in 1978. Barty, who won her first Wimbledon title this year and a bronze medal at the Olympics in mixed doubles, previously won the award in 2019.
“After such a rewarding year for me, my team, family and fans it is a great honour to be named the ITF World Champion for the seventh time,” Djokovic said.
“I am very grateful and proud for the results I’ve achieved and fortunate I had a chance to compete for the Serbian national team, too.”  Djokovic is tied with Rafa Nadal and Roger Federer on 20 Grand Slams and could make the record his own if he wins next month’s Australian Open — a tournament he has won a record nine times.
Croatian duo Nikola Mektic and Mate Pavic were named ITF men’s doubles world champions after winning nine titles this season, while Barbora Krejcikova and Katerina Siniakova won the women’s doubles award for a second time.
“It has been an incredible year for us — Wimbledon, Olympics, nine titles, year end number one and now first Croatian pair ever to be named ITF World Champions,” Pavic said. “It’s something special and we’re very happy about it.”

7,Indian squad reaches SA for curtailed series,JOHANNESBURG: The Indian cricket squad arrived in Johannesburg on Thursday and headed straight for their bio-secure...,"JOHANNESBURG: The Indian cricket squad arrived in Johannesburg on Thursday and headed straight for their bio-secure base at the start of a curtailed South Africa tour.
India will play three Tests and three ODIs despite a surge in coronavirus cases in South Africa, but four planned T20 Internationals have been dropped from the original schedule.
“Indian team has arrived safely in Johannesburg,” tweeted Cricket South Africa (CSA) board chairman Lawson Naidoo.  “All set for Friendship Series starting on Boxing Day.”
The official CSA twitter account posted pictures of the players arriving and then boarding a bus which took them to a bio-secure location within easy reach of the venues of the first two Tests, Centurion and Johannesburg.
The first Test starts on Dec 26, the second on Jan 3.
The Indian team will then fly to Cape Town for the third Test starting on Jan 11 and will stay in the same accommodation in the city for the one-day games in Paarl and Cape Town.
The Indians flew on a chartered aircraft and will be confined to their hotel and the cricket grounds in a country which has had a rapid rise rate of Covid infections following the identification of the Omicron variant.
The country’s Department of Health reported 26,976 new cases on Wednesday but CSA medical officer Shuaib Manjra is confident that the series will not be affected by the pandemic.
Dr Manjra said on Tuesday that new guidelines had been agreed by CSA and the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
Because all the squad members are fully vaccinated, anyone testing positive during the tour will be able to isolate in their hotel room instead of having to leave the  “bubble”, unless they have severe symptoms. Close contacts will be able to continue training.
The tour is of crucial importance to the cash-strapped host body, which announced a R221-million (about $13.8-million) loss at its annual meeting in October.
Although the T20 games were earlier this month cut from the original schedule, the India tour is expected to earn CSA about R600-million (about $37.5-million) in broadcast fees and other income.
It is not yet clear whether spectators will be able to attend matches.
The South African government currently allows a maximum of 2,000 people for outdoor gatherings but revised regulations are expected to be announced soon following the recent surge in coronavirus cases.

9,Two more Premier League matches called off,LONDON: The number of postponements in the English Premier League rose to five in a week on Thursday after two more...,"LONDON: The number of postponements in the English Premier League rose to five in a week on Thursday after two more matches were called off.
A growing number of infections at Leicester led to its game against Tottenham being postponed hours before kickoff on Thursday. An ongoing outbreak within Manchester United’s squad also meant its game against Brighton on Saturday won’t go ahead.
Covid-19 cases at Brentford meant it was unable to host United on Tuesday, while Brighton-Tottenham on Sunday and Burnley-Watford were also postponed reflecting the worsening health emergency in Britain as the omicron variant spreads.
Brentford manager Thomas Frank said he wants the weekend round of fixtures to be postponed to allow clubs to deal with the outbreaks.
Frank was informed midway through his news conference on Thursday, ahead of Brentford’s away match at Southampton on Saturday, of four more cases of the coronavirus among players and staff at the club. That took the total to 13.
“We should postpone the full round of Premier League games this weekend,” Frank said. 
Frank said postponing this weekends round could be enough to ensure the busy festive program in the division will be able to go ahead largely as planned.
“We fully respect that we want to play and it is important football keeps going,” Frank said, “and this way we can make sure Boxing Day keeps going, Im 100% sure of that.”
“This omicron variant is running like wildfire around the world and I think we need to do all we can to protect and avoid it. We can do a lot by closing down training grounds for three, four or five days, and then we can go again.”

10,Haaland brace sinks Fuerth as Dortmund trim Bayern’s lead,BERLIN: Erling Haaland scored twice on Wednesday as Borussia Dortmund trimmed Bayern Munich’s lead at the top of...,"BERLIN: Erling Haaland scored twice on Wednesday as Borussia Dortmund trimmed Bayern Munich’s lead at the top of the Bundesliga table to six points with a 3-0 win over bottom side Greuther Fuerth.
Haaland struck either side of half-time before Dutch striker Donyell Malen grabbed Dortmund’s late third goal.
The home victory allows Dortmund to peg back the points gap behind Bayern, who remain on course for a 10th straight league title after thumping Stuttgart 5-0 on Tuesday.
Haaland has scored 19 goals in 15 games for Dortmund this season and the towering Norwegian again shone at Signal Iduna Park.
His early well-timed pass in the box saw Thorgan Hazard hit the net, but the goal was ruled offside.
Haaland then converted a first-half penalty and headed in a Julian Brandt free-kick eight minutes from time before replacement Malen fired in Dortmund’s third goal, also from Brandt’s final pass.
Dortmund are also six points ahead of third-placed Lever­kusen, who were held to a 2-2 draw at home by Hoffenheim on Wednesday.
Czech striker Patrik Schick scored twice to put Leverkusen 2-0 up with an hour gone, but Hoffenheim scored late goals from Angelo Stiller and Munas Dabbur to claim a point.
Leverkusen finished with ten men after Moussa Diaby was shown a second yellow card for lashing out at Hoffenheim defender Florian Grillitsch in stoppage time.
Earlier, Japan forward Daichi Kamada scored his first Bundesliga goal this season to give Eintracht Frankfurt a 3-2 win at Borussia Moenchen­gladbach following a flurry of second-half goals.
The attacking midfielder hit the superb winner, beating the back-tracking Gladbach defence with his first touch and tucking his finish into the corner under pressure.
The goal, his first in Germany’s top flight this campaign after scoring three times in six Europa League group-stage games, came after a frantic start to the second-half with three goals in five minutes.
Frankfurt then played the last 20 minutes a man down at Borussia Park after Brazilian defender Tuta was sent off for a second booking for fouling Marcus Thuram.
Frankfurt are seventh, but just three points from a top four place after backing up Sunday’s 5-2 home drubbing of Leverkusen with another impressive victory.
In contrast, Gladbach have lost their last four league games and are just a point from the bottom three.
They took an early lead when midfielder Florian Neuhaus hit the back of the net.
Frankfurt equalised out of nothing just before half-time when their Colombia forward Rafael Borre finished off a lightning counter-attack.
The game burst into life just after the break when Frankfurt’s Danish midfielder Jesper Lindstrom, who also scored against Leverkusen last Sunday, put Frankfurt 2-1 up, crashing in his shot off the underside of the crossbar.
Four minutes later, Gladbach defender Ramy Bensebaini converted a penalty after Kouadio Kone was brought down in the area, only for Frankfurt to immediately retake the lead when Kamada hit the winner after exchanging passes with Borre.
