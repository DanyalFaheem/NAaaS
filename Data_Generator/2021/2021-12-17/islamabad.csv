Chairman of Young Consultants Association Pakistan Dr Asfandyar Khan said the promotions could not have been possible without efforts of the Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) Dr Faisal Sultan, Federal Secretary (Health) Amir Ashraf Khawaja and Additional Secretary Nabil Awan and it has put an end to apprehensions of employees.
It is worth mentioning that during November 2020, President of Pakistan Dr Arif Alvi had promulgated the Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) Ordinance. According to the initial draft, the hospital’s Board of Governors (BoG) was to deal with all affairs of Pims once it became an MTI. The members were appointed and notified by the Ministry of Health on the recommendation of a search and nomination council. The BoG had overall superintendence and control over the functions of the hospital. It had power to appoint deans, the hospital director, medical director, nursing director and finance director of the hospital.
Employees had held a number of protests and strikes against the BoG, as they believed that they will lose their status as civil servants. 
The ministry had assured them that they will not lose their status. 
The departmental promotion committee (DPC) chaired by Additional Secretary Nabil Awan has promoted over 300 doctors and nurses of the hospital.
According to documents, available with Dawn, two senior doctors Amir Maqbool and Fouzia Sabhi have been promoted in BPS 20. 
As many as 29 doctors have been promoted as assistant professors and senior registrars and 70 medical officers have been placed in BPS 18. More than 200 nurses have been promoted from BPS 16 to 17 and from BPS 17 to 18.
Dr Khan said employees were thankful to the management of the hospital. 
“Dean of MTI Prof Rizwan Taj also supported promotion of all the consultant nurses and other staff of Pims. We congratulate all young consultant nurses and all supporting staff on their well deserved promotions”, he said.
Meanwhile, president of Young Consultants Association Pakistan Dr Hamid Butt said it was a major development for employees and hoped that the government will ensure that all grievances of employees, across the country, will be addressed.

This was highlighted by speakers at a conference on Thursday as they emphasised upon the importance of harnessing the power of media.
World Wide Fund (WWF) Pakistan, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) and the Tourism Department (Gilgit-Baltistan) jointly organised the event, utilising local films and panel discussions to highlight biodiversity in the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalayan region and the impact of climate change and anthropogenic activities.
Titled ‘Voices from the Mountains: Sustainable Tourism in the Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalayan Region’, the event was organised as a follow up to the ‘Bam-i-Dunya Film Festival’ held in Gilgit between Dec 10 and 11 to mark International Mountain Day.
Winning films from the documentary, fiction, experimental, special jury mention, amateur and women-in-film categories were screened at the event, which was attended by representatives of non-profit, development organisations, academia along with local filmmakers and students. 
Sahibzada Irfanullah from the UNDP said mountains in Pakistan were rich in flora and fauna of national and international significance with diverse landscapes ranging from mountain peaks to plateaus and glaciers. However, environmental degradation and climate change was a real threat to these ecosystems.
Elaborating on ICIMOD’s role in sustainable mountain tourism, Mohammad Ismail said that glaciers were melting at a faster rate, giving rise to GLOFs, erosion and in turn, biodiversity loss.
“Recognising that tourism presents both opportunities and challenges, we have been prioritising sustainable mountain development; analysing risks of GLOFs, climate change adaptation, sustainable forest management and the conservation of snow leopards in the region”, he added.
The screenings were followed by a panel discussion with experts from ICIMOD, WWF-Pakistan, and the US Embassy, Islamabad. Experts stressed on public engagement in developing policies around sustainable tourism, enhancing the capacity of local communities, sustainable mountain architecture and the need for trans-boundary collaboration for sustainable tourism.
Haider Raza said: “Tourism has significantly increased in the GB region, which is a fragile area. We do not have the infrastructure and associated systems to support it such as appropriate liquid and solid waste collection and disposal. It is imperative that we develop and enforce guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to protect fragile mountain ecosystems and ensure that the finances being generated from tourism are benefiting the local community and economy”.
Raja Rasheed Ali said, “We are focusing on improving the livelihoods of the people, making the land cultivable and are using technology to streamline tourism by dividing and diversifying the concentration of tourists in certain areas”.

Acknowledging the efforts of the Ministry of Human Rights, Mr Dawood said the preparation and adoption of the national action plan would improve the quality of life in the country by developing a fruitful interaction among stakeholders of the business community and the working class.
He welcomed the action items aimed at promoting responsible conduct of businesses and termed it a major landmark in the fulfillment of commitments of Pakistan under the GSP Plus status.
UNDP Deputy Resident Representative Aliona Niculita, ambassadors of various countries and diplomats were also present in the ceremony.
Federal Minister for Human Rights Shireen Mazari said the government had given top priority to human rights and Pakistan was the first country in South Asia that had devised and launched such an action plan.
She said an inter-ministerial implementation committee would be constituted taking all business communities, chambers of commerce and labour unions on board to ensure the implementation of the plan in a pre-defined timeframe.
She said the government was concerned about the rights of women and children at workplace and concrete steps would be taken to check harassment at workplace.

Speaking at a seminar titled ‘Reasons and Lessons after 50 Years of the Fall Of Dhaka’ organised by the party, the PML-N leaders regretted that the country had not learnt any lesson from the tragic incident of the separation of East Pakistan and it was still facing a 1971-like situation.
PML-N’s senior vice-president and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the separation of East Pakistan did not happen overnight, but was a result of a political process. 
He said the people of Bengal had tabled their demands in front of the people of Pakistan, participated in the elections and when they were refused government even after winning the elections, they decided to secede from Pakistan. 
Mr Abbasi said it was unfortunate that the history of this country had been distorted to the point that the coming generation had no idea about the truth. 
He said majority of the demand that had been made by Sheikh Mujibur Rehman of the the Awami League were now a functional part of Pakistan’s constitution after the passage of the 18th Amendment. He said this showed that the Awami League’s demands were not something out of the extraordinary, but in fact, they were progressive reforms proposed well ahead of their time.

6,"Owners, teachers protest shifting of schools from Pindi residential areas","Say four schools sealed after protest; RCB issues notices to owners, denies sealing institutes.","RAWALPINDI: Teachers, parents and staff of private schools in the cantonment areas on Thursday staged a protest demonstration against the decision of the cantonment boards to shift educational institutions from residential areas. 
Private Educational Institutions Joint Action Committee convener Ibrar Ahmed Khan said four schools were sealed by Rawalpindi and Chaklala cantonment boards on Thursday. 
However, Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) spokesman Qaiser Mehmood said they did not seal any school but had issued red notices to the schools to vacate residential areas by the end of December. 
On the other hand, District Education Authority formed teams to collect data about private schools whose managements brought students to participate in their protests.  
“We will take action against all schools that brought students to their protest rallies after compiling the data in a day or two,” Mohammad Azam Kashif, the chief executive officer of the authority, told Dawn. 

Say four schools sealed after protest; RCB issues notices to owners, denies sealing institutes

He said schools that violated the law by bringing children to any protest rally will have to pay a fine ranging from Rs300,000 to Rs4 million. Besides, the registration of the school concerned would be cancelled. He said the Supreme Court had ordered the cantonment boards to vacate residential areas from educational institutions and the authority would help the civic bodies implement the order. 
On Thursday, parents, teachers, school staff and students protested at Chur Chowk on Peshawar Road.  
All Pakistan Private Schools and Colleges Association central President Malik Ibrar Hussain, Punjab chapter chief Ilyas Kiani, Rana Suhail, Malik Hafeezur Rehman and others led the protest. 
The participants were carrying placards and chanting slogans in favour of their demands.  
The protesters said the closure of private educational institutions would affect nearly four million students, leave thousands of teachers unemployed and cause a loss of billions of rupees to the school owners. 
They said the protest would be held on a daily basis in front of every school from Friday till the decision was reversed. 
All Malik Ibrar said the closure of schools will affect education of children and many of them will remain out of school. 
“There are already 25 million children out of school in the country and their number will increase further due to poor policies of the government. Pakistan is currently ranked 125th in the list of most educationally backward countries,” he said. 
Malik Ibrar told Dawn that an emergency meeting of the Joint Action Committee was held after sealing of private schools in cantonments across the country. 
He said Rawalpindi and Chaklala cantonment boards started sealing schools which was tantamount to inciting school owners, teachers and students. 
“Broomfield School Tahli Mohri, SLS School at Harley Street, EFA School Dheri Hassanabad and Muslim School have been sealed,” he said. 
On the one hand, the OIC meeting is going to be held on Monday and on the other the cantonment boards are forcing private educational institutions to block roads by holding protests.  
“What impression are we giving to the OIC member countries?” he said. 
When contacted, RCB spokesman Qaiser Mehmood told Dawn that the cantonment board did not seal any school or college in its limits. 
Despite repeated attempts, Additional Cantonment Executive Officer Chaklala Mohammad Hayat could not be contacted for comments.

7,Humid winds bring temporary relief from air pollution,ISLAMABAD: A sigh of relief for those suffering from seasonal allergy as air pollution dropped to almost half by...,"ISLAMABAD: A sigh of relief for those suffering from seasonal allergy as air pollution dropped to almost half by Thursday evening amid flow of humid winds from the east and the northeast. 
However, the respite is for a brief period as the winds were a result of La Nina conditions. La Nina and El Nino are weather patterns that occur in the Pacific Ocean. 
The La Nina pattern occurs in the winters and causes drier than average weather in some regions. 
On the other hand, El Nino weather pattern occurs in the summer months and can cause wetter than average years in some parts and reduces the seasonal rainfall in other areas. 
The cold winds in the capital also led to falling of snowflakes on the peaks of Margalla Hills late on Thursday afternoon.
The quality of air monitored by the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) shows that by Thursday evening it had reached around 70 microgramsper cubic metre of air and decreased further by night.
As a result, the quality of air has reached the “moderate level” against the “unhealthy level” that was prevailing for almost two months.
Due to continuous cold and dry weather, the air quality had deteriorated to a severe level in the federal capital, leading to allergy, lungs and skin problems among sensitive people.
According to the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS), the permissible limit of air pollution is 35 microgramsper cubic metre of air. The average air pollution in Islamabad by Wednesday night was 129.58 microgramsper cubic metre of air. As per the standards, one microgram is around one-millionth of a gram.
However, strong winds accompanied by high humidity coming from the east and the northeast reduced the solid particles in the air.
“The air quality in Islamabad has not been within the safe limit for almost two months,” said Dr Mohsina Zubair, director labs at the EPA.
She said the quality of air in Islamabad was within safe limits for humans and it was not as severe as in Lahore and other areas of Punjab.
“Air pollution in Islamabad is not due to any major industrial or construction activity but due to vehicular emissions and trans-boundary movement of solid particles which are very small. But the number of such particles in the air is so much that it gives a hazy looks,” Dr Mohsina said.
She said rainfall helps clear the air as these solid particles are washed off.
The air quality is likely to remain within the moderate level for the next four to five days but due to lack of rainfall it will fall back into the unhealthy level from Tuesday.
The Met Office predicted rain/wind thunderstorm with light snow over mountains at isolated places in Kashmir and its adjoining areas, but there is no prediction of rainfall in Islamabad and the Potohar region.
“There are no indications of rainfall in near future and the present cold and dry conditions will prevail,” said Met Office spokespersonDr Zaheer Ahmed.
The record of the Met Office shows that the average rainfall during December in Islamabad is 40.4mm but it had only been two mm till now and there is a remote chance of further rainfall in the current month due to the prevailing La Nina conditions.
The Met Office said the current La Niña conditions were expected to continue with moderate intensity till February, and Dr Ahmed said the delayed and erratic rainfall pattern seemed to be a new normal in the wake of climate change.

9,Digital service launched to verify equivalence certificates,Shafqat says all organisations under the education ministry are moving towards digitising processes to facilitate the public.,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Education Shafqat Mahmood on Friday launched the digital equivalence certificate verification service introduced by Inter Board Committee of Chairmen (IBCC).
The launching ceremony was held at Ministry of Federal Education on Dec 16, 2021. IBCC Secretary Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah briefed the minister on the utility and benefits of this new service.
IBCC is the umbrella board of all educational boards and is responsible for issuing equivalence certificates to O and A level students.
Speaking to participants of the launching ceremony, the minister said in light of the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan, all organisations working under the education ministry are digitalising processes for transparency in order to facilitate the public.
After successful completion of online equivalence process, the IBCC has digitalised the process of verification of equivalence certificates. This service will enhance accessibility, reduce the cost and time besides other hurdles faced by organisations within or outside the country. He appreciated IBCC for facilitating the public through the use of technology.
Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah said that security feature in certificates will be integrated through encrypted QR code. Now, organisations, institutions or universities do not need to send documents to IBCC for verification. He said this is a real-time verification through which organisations can quickly verify data on their mobile or computer and will receive a verification email for their official record.
“Due to this new security feature the IBCC will also save millions of rupees annually by removing old and traditional manual security features from the certificate”, he said and added that work load on staff of IBCC will also be reduced.

Minister for Science and Technology Senator Shibli Faraz on Thursday visited the IT ministry to discuss the electronic voting machines (EVMs) and i-voting for the overseas Pakistanis.
Sources said Minister for IT and Telecom Syed Aminul Haque suggested that the federal cabinet should be briefed about the concept of i-voting at its meeting on Tuesday.
However, the minister rejected the idea that the storage of digital data after the elections should not be a mandate of the IT ministry.
Sources added that Mr Haque informed Mr Faraz that the National Telecommunication Corporation (NTC) was the state owned firm providing digital data storage services.
But the IT minister said the ECP should invite tenders for firms to store the post-election data as the elections would be held through the EVMs.
Later, talking to Dawn, the IT minister confirmed that the role of his ministry should be limited to providing technical support to the ECP only.
“There are two challenges for holding elections through the EVMs and for i-voting. The first one is to protect the election process as well as the Nadra system from any cyber attack,” Mr Haque said adding: “The second one is to store the data after electronic voting.”
The minister said the ECP should call tenders for both the tasks and the NTC has to compete with the private firms as it would enhance its competitiveness and ensure transparency in the whole process.
The federal cabinet in its last meeting asked the ECP to float tenders for the purchase of EVMs as it has been decided that the next local government elections would be held through the EVMs.

12,Latest technology vital to achieving prosperity: president,Says it is important for Pakistan to increase its technological footprint.,"SLAMABAD: President Dr Arif Alvi on Thursday said the adoption of latest technology and gearing up for the fourth industrial revolution was the best pathway for Pakistan to achieve prosperity.
Addressing the seventh International Conference on Aerospace Science and Engineering (ICASE) here at the Institute of Science and Technology, he said being the fifth largest human resource in the world, it was important for Pakistan to increase its technological footprint.
The event, organised by the National Centre for GIS (Geographic Information Science) and Space Applications was joined by foreign and local scientists to discuss several topics including aeronautics, space sciences, material science and engineering, avionics, remote sensing and geo-informatics.
President Alvi said the study of space, galaxies and various other astronomical phenomena was a centuries-old endeavour that had been intertwined with the development of human societies.
He said resistance to new technologies hampered the journey of development and stressed the need for scientific research in cutting-edge space sciences to match challenges of the contemporary world.
He mentioned the utility of space sciences in everyday life and added that improving technical and professional capacity in climate change could help manage the adverse impact for Pakistan as it is one of the most vulnerable countries.
Also, he said, areas including food security, agriculture, crop patterns, and environment could also benefit from research in space science and geo-informatics.
Dr Alvi said the past century had been host to many technological advancements resulting in a gradual progression towards the betterment of society.
He emphasised on strengthening scientific and theoretical foundations to create professionals with the thorough capability of applying knowledge for research, analysis, and design.
He expressed confidence that IST would equip its students with specialised education in the fields of engineering and space science to address emerging national and global issues in these fields.
IST Vice Chancellor Rehan Abdul Baqi said space sciences had become a field of paramount importance the world over and Pakistan was no exception.
Since 2002, he said, IST had been working on fostering intellectual and economic vitality through teaching, research, and outreach in the field of space science and technology with a view to improve the quality of life.
ICASE Secretary Dr Najam Abbas Naqvi said the aim of the institute was to provide outstanding quality education to diverse groups of national and international students.
