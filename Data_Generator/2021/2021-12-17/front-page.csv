0,Govt mulls taking Wajih to court as anti-PM rant hits a nerve,Ex-SC judge stands by claim that Tareen bore Imran’s household expenses...,"ISLAMABAD: A new controversy over monthly expenses of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s palatial hilltop house at Banigala being borne by his political associate Jahangir Tareen intensified on Thursday when Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry vowed to file a defamation suit against retired Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed who stood by his claim and insisted that it was based on “truth”. 
“We are going to file a defamation case against Wajihuddin for levelling baseless allegations against the prime minister,” the minister announced at a press conference. 
He said notices would also be issued to TV channels which ran the news regarding Mr Ahmed’s allegations without verification. 
The minister appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan and the heads of all high courts to ensure protection of the institutions’ respect. “The office of the prime minister is also an institution and it is important to protect its respect,” he added. 
A couple of days ago, Mr Ahmed, who had resigned from the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) five years ago after developing differences with party chief Imran Khan, had claimed during a Bol News programme ‘Tabdeeli’ that the party’s now disgruntled leader Jahangir Tareen used to provide up to Rs5 million for Imran Khan’s monthly household expenses. 

Ex-SC judge stands by claim that Tareen bore Imran’s household expenses

“This belief is entirely false that Imran Khan is a [financially] honest man as his condition is such that he hasn’t been running his household himself for years,” Mr Ahmed had said. 
However, his statement was rejected by Mr Tareen in a tweet, in which he wrote: “Regardless of the current status of my relationship with Imran khan, the truth must be told.” 
Mr Tareen said while he had done whatever was in his capacity to help the PTI in the quest to build a new Pakistan”, he “never gave a penny for the household expenses of Banigala”. 
Fawad Chaudhry acknowledged Mr Tareen’s timely clarification saying he had proved that “he is a gentleman”. 
Terming Mr Ahmed’s allegation a reference point, the minister said it was being felt that media freedom was being used for specific campaigns to “weaken the system”. 
“The way the prime minister was targeted is condemnable,” he said. “Why our judicial system is failing to protect an individual’s dignity, especially when the prime minister becomes a victim of propaganda?”  
He appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan and the heads of all high courts to ensure that the respect of the national institutions must be upheld. 
Mr Chaudhry claimed that PM Imran never burdened the national exchequer, adding that his [PM] monthly income figures were also misreported by TV channels. 
“We see that maligning anyone is not an issue anymore and the big reason for this is that defamation cases in courts are not being taken seriously,” he said. 
He suggested that chief justices of high courts must form special division benches to specifically deal with such cases. 
Mr Chaudhry accused broadcast media of running campaigns against army generals and judges on a daily basis. “The same channels face fines abroad but in Pakistan, there is no law, let alone its implementation.” 
He said the government planned to get the Pakistan Media Regulatory Authority Bill approved from relevant bodies to streamline local media, which was being “used to run specific campaigns to target the system of the country”. 
“If we don’t introduce tough laws, the system will keep on getting weakened due to fake news,” the minister warned. 
Wajih stands by his claim 
On the other hand, retired Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed insisted that his statement about Mr Tareen paying for Mr Khan’s household expenses was based on “truth”. He said if anyone wanted to file a defamation suit against him, “they must do so as the courts are open”. 
He made these remarks during a press talk at the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM)’s office in Karachi’s Bahadurabad, where he had gone to meet the party leaders for an unspecified reason. 
Mr Ahmed, who was accompanied by the MQM’s Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, whose party is a crucial ally of the ruling PTI, was asked by reporters about the government’s decision to pursue legal proceedings against him for his statement. An unfazed Ahmed replied that anyone could exercise their right to file a defamation suit. 
Pausing as the call to prayer began during his media talk, Mr Ahmed remarked that the “Azaan is a testimony that an honest man is speaking”. 
When questioned about Mr Tareen’s denial of his claim, Mr Ahmed said the sugar baron had no other option except to refuse to admit the “fact”. “These payments were out of the books and were not accounted for. Hence it is easy for him to deny it,” he claimed. 
The former Supreme Court judge also questioned the veracity of reports of sour ties between Mr Tareen and the prime minister, asking “is he really on bad terms with Imran Khan?” He said no action was taken against the estranged PTI leader in the sugar scam probe. 
“In that crisis, you earned ... billions of rupees,” he said of Mr Tareen and insisted that his statement was “expected”.

1,"Imran vows to never let down survivors, parents of APS martyrs",Opposition slams government for offering amnesty to TTP...,"ISLAMABAD: Marking the seventh anniversary of Army Public School (APS) carnage, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday vowed to never “let down the survivors and parents” of those martyred in the tragic incident and said the country had “successfully defeated terrorism”.  
On the other hand, the opposition criticised the government for offering amnesty to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) involved in the deadliest terrorist attack in the country’s history [APS] in which 140 people, including 131 schoolchildren, were martyred when heavily armed militants stormed the school building in Peshawar on Dec 16, 2014.  
Recalling one of the darkest days in Pakistan’s history, the prime minister said in a tweet that there would be “zero tolerance for violence and those using it as a tool”.  
The attack had shocked the entire nation as terrorists stormed the school and fired at children attending classes at the time.  

Opposition slams government for offering amnesty to TTP

TTP leader Umer Mansoor alias Umer Narae had reportedly claimed responsibility for the APS carnage. The United States government and Pakistan Army later confirmed that Umar was killed in a US drone strike in Nangarhar province of Afghanistan on July 9, 2016.  
Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly and PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif called it a painful day for the nation in a tweet and asked: “Have we learned any lessons and corrected our course? When will we sincerely put our heads together for better future of our children? There are too many questions but too few answers.”  
Pakistan Peoples Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said the nation still felt the pain of “this great tragedy”, adding that “everyone is still waiting for justice to be served to the innocent souls”. He demanded that the “beasts” that planned, facilitated and carried out the massacre of the innocent children and teachers be brought to justice.  
Mr Bhutto-Zardari also criticised the prime minister for offering amnesty to the TTP and said any such decision should be taken in parliament, and not “in the darkness of night”.  
On December 24, 2014, a week after the terrorist struck, then prime minister Nawaz Sharif announced a comprehensive strategy to defeat what many had come to believe was an existential threat to Pakistan.  
Mr Sharif had called the 20-point National Action Plan (NAP), prepared after two days of marathon meetings of heads of parliamentary parties, a defining moment in the fight against terrorism. “A line has been drawn,” a sombre prime minister had told the nation.  
The NAP included steps for registration and regulation of seminaries, a ban on glorification of terrorists in the media, Fata reforms, dismantling of the communication networks of terrorists, measures against abuse of internet and social media for terrorism, reversing the trend of militancy, a Karachi operation to end lawlessness and denying space to militants and extremism.  
The plan had called for steps to reconcile the dissident Baloch, ending sectarian terrorism, repatriating Afghan refugees and revamping the criminal justice system.  
In October 2018, the Peshawar High Court had formed the single-member commission of Justice Mohammad Ibrahim Khan on the orders of the Supreme Court to probe the carnage. The commission had submitted its initial report to the apex court in July last year.  
The report in its conclusion noted that terrorism perpetrated by Pakistan’s enemies had reached its peak in the year 2013-14, but said “this still doesn’t obligate us to hold that our sensitive installation(s) and soft target(s) could be forsaken as a prey to the terrorists’ attack”.  
It said the entry of terrorists from across the Afghan border into the school’s perimeter after “befooling the security apparatus” was mainly due to the porous nature of the border and “unrestrained movement” of Afghan refugees across the frontier. The report termed “unpardonable” the assistance provided to the militants by the residents of the school’s locality, saying it was “palpable”.

2,ODI series with West Indies put off till June,"PCB official says bio-secure bubble created for series was not breached, virus reached West Indies players during travel.","KARACHI: Another blow for Pakistan cricket. And once again, for no fault of its own.  
Pakistan Cricket Board’s chief operating officer Salman Naseer said that West Indies players contracted Covid-19 during transit on their way to the country, with the new positive cases that emerged on Thursday meaning that the three-match ODI series between the two teams starting this weekend would not go ahead.  
It followed New Zealand’s tour abandonment due to security risks and England’s subsequent withdrawal from their scheduled series due to what they said were mental health concerns earlier this year.  
An official announcement regarding the West Indies series postponement was made an hour before Naseer’s news conference, during the third and final Twenty20 International bet­ween Pakistan and West Indies at the National Stadium.  
The fate of that match had also been shrouded in doubt since the early hours of Thursday when reports first emerged that three more West Indies players and two members of the coaching staff had tested positive for coronavirus. Three other West Indies players had tested positive for Covid before the start of the T20 series.  
However, the T20 match went ahead after the PCB and Cricket West Indies (CWI) held a series of meetings where it was also decided that the ODI series would now be postponed till June 2022.  
“It’s been a tough week… especially the last 24 hours but we have to accept the Covid reality,” Naseer told the news conference, during the third T20 which Pakistan won to complete a 3-0 series sweep.   
“We have had long discussions with the CWI, which were even more difficult due to the time difference between here and the West Indies.  
“The latest positive tests [of ODI captain Shai Hope, spinner Akeal Hosein and all-rounder Justin Greaves] had severely depleted their team strength and the CWI felt that it couldn’t field a strong eleven for the ODIs especially since it carries points for the World Cup league.  
“Their players were worried that a serious Covid-19 outbreak could prevent them from reaching back home in time for Christmas.  
“So taking player welfare into account as well as their team strength, it was decided that the series will be rescheduled for the first week of June 2022.”  
The ODI series was scheduled to end on Dec 22.  
And while the infected players and members of the coaching staff entered a 10-day self-isolation period on Wednesday, lasting until Dec 24, Naseer was confident that they would return home for Christmas.  
“Arrangements are being made for the departure of those who have given negative tests to fly out as soon as possible while we are hopeful that those staying back will also reach West Indies in time,” he said.  
He stated that the bio-secure bubble created by the PCB for the series had not been breached but the virus strain reached the West Indies players while they were travelling. Some of the West Indies players flew in from Dubai after the T10 league while the others arrived from Sri Lanka, where the West Indies were playing a Test series.  
Naseer also defended the move of allowing the third T20 when the Covid positive cases were already known. “We were not putting our players at risk,” he said.  
“There has been very minimal interaction between the two teams and our medical team consulted with experts who said that there was no chance of our players contracting the virus from the West Indies players who could’ve been close contacts.”  
Naseer added that the series postponement would not affect Australia’s scheduled tour in March next year. “It was for no fault of ours,” he said.  
“Australia’s security team was on a recce trip during the T20s and it’s not a security issue but a virus issue which is beyond our control. We went by global standards of isolation and testing.”  
The postponement will hit PCB financially, but Naseer said there had been “positive” discussions with the West Indies about playing three additional T20s to help recover from the losses.  
The PCB’s acting chief executive officer also said that there will be an announcement regarding a tour by New Zealand at the end of next year which would provide PCB some compensation for the losses it suffered due to their decision to abandon their tour in September.  
England have already agreed to play two additional T20s against Pakistan when they tour next year as compensation for their cancelled tour in October.

3,Pakistan Refinery shuts down till ‘situation improves’,Executive says company was forced to shut down operations after running out of storage capacity.,"KARACHI/LAHORE: The Pakistan Refinery Ltd (PRL) temporarily shut down its production on Thursday because of operational and ullage constraints, according to a regulatory filing with the Pakistan Stock Exchange.
The refinery will stay shut “until the situation improves”, said the notice by PRL, which is one of the five refineries operating in the country.
A senior PRL executive told Dawn the company was forced to shut down operations after it ran out of storage capacity. The situation arose after the refusal to lift fuel by independent power producers (IPPs) that also have storage for emergency use.
“Since the power sector is not lifting refined fuel oil from the local refineries, almost all of them are facing storage constraints and shutting down further production gradually. Rented storages have massive costs. So no one is interested in that, except one company that plans to export fuel oil,” he said on condition of anonymity.
The source claimed the Power Division had made a mess of things with the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) having imported refined oil in large quantities at the expense of the local refineries. “The IPPs say they don’t have the money to pay PSO because of non-payment of their arrears. Hence, the PSO was reluctant to supply oil to them,” he added.
He went on to predict that all refineries would shut down in 15 days if the issue wasn’t resolved immediately.
In a letter the Oil Companies Advisory Council wrote earlier this month, the representative body of the downstream oil industry warned the Petroleum Division of a shortage of petroleum products if the refineries were forced to reduce their crude oil processing owing to the failure of generation companies (Gencos) and IPPs to lift the processed fuel.
Oil marketing companies (OMCs) consume refinery-produced finished products before importing the deficit volumes. But Gencos and IPPs didn’t lift the committed quantities, resulting in stock build-up at storage facilities of OMCs.
“All the storages of power plants are empty and IPPs are maintaining two to three days of stock in storages. On the other hand, refineries are planning to export fuel oil at a great financial loss,” it said.
The fact that the local refineries are operating at a low capacity while refined products are being imported is resulting in a significant loss of foreign exchange. The oil import bill, particularly of refined petroleum products, constituted the largest chunk of about 83 per cent increase in imports during the first five months (July-November) of the current fiscal year.
The five refineries could together produce about 274,000 tonnes of petrol per month with optimum capacity utilisation. However, they were producing about 170,000 tonnes a month, which is almost 60pc lower than their combined capacity.
Similarly, the local refineries are producing 330,000 tonnes of high-speed diesel (HSD) every month, which is about 48pc lower than their total monthly capacity of about 490,000 tonnes. According to the refinery data shared with the government, PRL’s underproduction stood at about 30pc in both petrol and HSD.

4,US notes Islamabad’s efforts to meet FATF demands,"“Pakistan took steps to counter terror financing and restrain India-focused militant groups,” notes report.","WASHINGTON: The annual US report on terrorism acknowledged on Thursday that Pakistan took steps in 2020 to counter terrorism financing, restrain India-focused militant groups and to meet demands of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  
Pakistan continued to experience terrorist attacks last year, said the report. Pakistani military and security forces undertook counterterrorism operations against groups that conducted attacks within Pakistan, such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the militant Islamic State (IS) group and Balochistan Liberation Army.  
“Pakistan took steps in 2020 to counter terror financing and restrain India-focused militant groups from conducting attacks. Pakistan convicted Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) founder Hafiz Saeed and four other senior LeT leaders in multiple terrorism financing cases,” the report said.  
Although the report acknowledged Pakistan’s efforts to counter terrorism, it claimed that groups targeting Afghanistan and India — such as the Haqqani Network, LeT, and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) — continued to operate from Pakistani territory.  

Secretary of State Antony Blinken releases report in Washington

“Pakistan did not take action against other known terrorists such as JeM founder and UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar and 2008 Mumbai attack ‘project manager’ Sajid Mir, both of whom are believed to remain free in Pakistan,” the report added.  
But it also acknowledged that “Pakistan did make positive contributions to the Afghanistan peace process, such as encouraging Taliban reductions in violence”.  
Noting Pakistan’s efforts to meet the demands put forth by FATF, the report noted: “Pakistan made additional progress in 2020 toward completing its FATF Action Plan, but did not complete all Action Plan items and remained on the FATF ‘grey list’.”  
In a separate chapter titled “Support for Pakistan”, the report said the US government recognised Pakistan’s role in Afghanistan and broader regional security, and “urges Pakistan to dismantle terrorist groups within its territory”.  
It pointed out that the United States “cooperates with Pakistan on counterterrorism operations, which has helped Pakistan reclaim parts of the country previously held by militant groups”.  
Yet, TTP and other designated terrorist groups “continue to conduct attacks against Pakistani military and civilian targets”, said the report, adding that “while Pakistan has taken some action against these designated terrorist organisations, some externally focused terrorist groups continue to find safe haven in Pakistan”.  
That’s why “the US government continues to suspend most of its security assistance to Pakistan. That suspension remained in effect throughout 2020”, said the report.  
Despite the restriction, however, the US government maintained a civilian assistance portfolio on a focused set of priorities, the report added. “Civilian assistance continued to prioritise civil society; people-to-people exchanges; stabilisation and development on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border; trade and economic growth, 
including partnering with US businesses; law enforcement, counterterrorism.”  
The counterterrorism efforts included countering terrorist financing and related anti-money laundering, nonproliferation cooperation; and polio and other infectious diseases, including Covid-19.  
The report explained that the emphasis of US civilian assistance to Pakistan remained on sustainable development and capacity-building, and on leveraging trade and private sector investment, where possible.  
It also encouraged partnership and a long-term positive impact for the Pakistani people.  
People-to-people exchanges, which largely shifted to virtual exchanges during Covid-19, help promote mutual understanding and bilateral ties.  
“The United States supported civilian law enforcement and the rule of law to help Pakistan disrupt transnational organised crime and terrorist networks and provide security and justice for Pakistani citizens,” the report added.  
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who released the report in Washington, warned that globally “both the number of terrorist attacks and the overall number of fatalities from those attacks increased by more than 10 per cent”.  
He attributed this increase to “the spread of IS branches and networks and Al Qaeda affiliates, particularly in Africa”.
