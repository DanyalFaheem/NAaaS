Punjab Labour and Human Resource Department (L&HRD) and Migrant Resource Centre (MRC) Pakistan jointly organised a conference on “Protecting workers’ rights” and to observe International Migrants Day on Dec 18.  
The participants also discussed issues of the workers, exploitation of their rights, lack of awareness about laws and their rights and responsibilities.
Punjab Minister for Labour and Human Resource Ansar Majeed Khan said the major reason to observe International Migrants Day is to highlight and raise awareness about the rights of migrants. He said the state is responsible to protect the rights of overseas Pakistanis and for the purpose labourers should be aware of their rights and legal protection which the law of the land provides to them.
He announced launch of the multifaceted Labour Card in the province while 14 different features and facilities were part of the card, including purchase of subsidised merchandise and concession in transport and railway fares.
Mr Khan said the card would serve as debit and ATM card which could also be used for commercial purposes.  
He said the card would ensure at least Rs15,000 worth of additional financial benefits to the secured workers currently getting minimum wage of Rs20,000 to Rs25,000.  
MRC Coordinator Nadia Kashif said the centre is providing information on safe, legal and informed migration, and also raising awareness about their rights as migrant workers in their origin and destination countries. 
The conference brought together over 50 participants from academia, government policymakers, national and international experts in the field of labour migration to explore the strategies adopted by the Pakistan government in order to address the challenges faced by workers and Pakistani migrants, with particular reference to protecting their rights in destination countries.

2,PML-N wins by-polls,"MUZAFFARGARH: Pakistan Muslim League-N candidate Rana Saleem won the by-election for PP-206, Khanewal, while ...","MUZAFFARGARH: Pakistan Muslim League-N candidate Rana Saleem won the by-election for PP-206, Khanewal, while Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI’s) Noreen Nishat Daha stood far behind him.
PPP candidate Syed Mir Wasiq and Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s Akmal Sheikh stood third and fourth, respectively. 
According to unofficial results, the PML-N bagged 47,649 votes, PTI 34,030, PPP 15,059 and the TLP man got 9,616 votes. 
The seat fell vacant after PML-N Nishat Daha’s death on Oct 23. After the 2018 elections, he had informally joined the PTI. The PTI awarded ticket to his widow Noreen Nishat Daha for the by-poll, while the PML-N chose their rival Rana Saleem who was a PTI candidate in the 2018 elections. 
The turnout remained 39 per cent which was more than the expectations. 
Earlier, the day started with a foggy morning, and till noon, there was hardly any activity on any polling station. Voters, however, started coming to polling stations in the afternoon and there was a great rush at polling stations till evening. 
The PML-N workers celebrated the results with dance on drumbeats. The PPP camp was also jubilant over their improved tally. 
Local politicians and commentators said the PPP stole the vote of the PTI candidate from rural areas, while the TLP failed to get significant votes from the urban areas, which led to the comfortable win of the PML-N candidate and defeat of the PTI. They said the people rejected the PTI because of the price hike. 
The polling was held without any eventful incident. 
Ms Daha was caught showing her stamped ballot to the media, which invoked the Election Commission of Pakistan laws to cancel her vote as it was a violation of election laws. 
PPP candidate Mir Wasiq’s guard was arrested by police at a polling station for displaying weapons. Mir Wasiq protested the arrest of his guard. 
The police, however, said Section 144 was enforced in the by-election constituency and guard Waseem entered a polling station despite being stopped on which the police took timely action and arrested him and further operation is underway. 
DPO Nadeem Abbas said violators of Section 144 would be dealt with iron fists.
Commissioner Dr Irshad Ahmed and Regional Police Officer Javed Akbar Riaz visited Khanewal and reviewed the polling process and administrative and security measures. 
Khanewal Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Abbas Shirazi and DPO Syed Nadeem Abbas were also present.

3,Fafen reports illegal canvassing outside polling stations,ISLAMABAD: Campaigning and canvassing outside polling stations and persistent minor procedural irregularities in...,"ISLAMABAD: Campaigning and canvassing outside polling stations and persistent minor procedural irregularities in PP-206 (Khanewal-IV) by-election reinforced the need for stricter implementation of the election law and procedures, said the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) on Thursday.
Four political parties – the PML-N, PTI, PPPP and Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) – had fielded candidates for the by-election, while seven others contested independently. Albeit lower than the 57 per cent during the 2018 general elections, the turnout in PP-206 remained impressive as compared to less than 19pc in the recently held NA-133 (Lahore-XI) by-poll.
The seat had fallen vacant after the death of a PML-N MPA. The by-election came under the spotlight after the parties announced their candidates – the PTI nominee in the 2018 polls ran from the PML-N platform, while the widow of the deceased PML-N MPA received the PTI ticket. There were media reports of a clash between the supporters of PML-N and PPPP on Dec 15, a day before the election. The PPPP candidate alleged an attack on his residence by PML-N workers, and registered a case with the police. The PML-N, on the other hand, alleged the PPPP had indulged in vote buying.
Fafen had deployed 30 observers for 120 out of the total 183 polling stations across the constituency. Its preliminary report is based on the observations received from 82 polling stations.
The observers reported the polling day remained peaceful with no major incident, however, seven of them were barred from observing the electoral process. At one polling station (PS-70), the presiding officer (PO) continuously interrupted the observation.
According to the observers, one of the most common illegalities remained the campaigning and canvassing by candidates outside 85pc of the observed polling stations. At 29pc of the observed polling stations, the POs had not removed the campaigning material on their outer walls, while at four others the material was found pasted inside the premises. The polling material was found scarce at two polling stations. The PO at one polling station did not seek signatures of polling agents on Form-42 after showing them empty ballot boxes before the start of polling, as required by the law. Similarly, at two polling stations, the POs did not show the empty ballot boxes to polling agents. 
At two polling stations, voters were not allowed to vote despite possessing original identity cards. At two others, the assistant presiding officers (APOs) were found not stamping the back of the ballot papers while issuing them to voters, while at five stations the APOs were observed not signing the back of the ballot papers. Such ballot papers are excluded from the count at the polling station, and later rejected by the returning officers during consolidation of results.
At one polling station, unauthorised persons were found present inside the polling booth. At 43pc of the observed polling stations, the Covid-19 SOPs were not duly followed.
The ECP had set up 183 polling stations – 62 male, 60 female and 61 combined – in the constituency, while the number of registered voters in the constituency was 230,698 – 125,190 men and 105,508 women.

Initiating a general debate on the Sialkot tragedy, Law Minister Raja Basharat told the house that 120 people were under investigation, 52 had been arrested and 18 of them had been remanded in police custody, while none had been bailed out.
He said the challan of the case would be presented in the court within 30 days. He lauded the police role as exemplary for arresting the accused.
He said the senseless killing of the Sri Lankan citizen was a tragic incident that was condemned by every Pakistani, including the prime minister and the Punjab chief minister.
He said 182 people were identified with the help of CCTV cameras and detained immediately after the incident, while 62 of them were released for not being involved in the case. Fifty-two people were arrested, out of 120 brought under investigation and none of them had been bailed out.
He said a special prosecution team of three officers was assisting the police and monitoring the case.
He said the Council of Islamic Ideology and Shaan-i-Rehmatul-lil-Alameen Authority were working to prevent such incidents in future. He suggested a unanimous and effective legislation to prevent such incidents in future.
The minister recalled that over 50 Muslims had been martyred in a mosque in New Zealand which showed that such heinous incidents happened in every society, though no religion permitted violence.
Taking part in the debate, the opposition demanded action against those who form armed wings.
PML-N’s Samiullah Khan lamented that the government first banned the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan alleging it was being funded by India and then the state backed out of its stance.
He recalled that an army general had surrendered before his Indian counterpart back in 1971 and the PTI before the TLP in 2021.
He regretted that neither the chief minister nor the law minister went to condole with the heirs of the policemen martyred in clashes with the TLP, and contrary to it the outfit’s chief Saad Rizvi, after his release, went to the house of each deceased worker.
Khalil Tahir Sandhu, another N Leaguer, called for penalising those who levelled false allegations of blasphemy.

7,LHC appoints amicus curiae in plea against secret filming,A social activist had filed a petition in 2019 after incidents of blackmailing of women through secretly filmed videos.,"LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday appointed an amicus curiae in a public interest petition against secret filming, recording or photographing of individuals, especially women, both at private and public places without their knowledge or consent.  
Salman Sufi, a social activist who works for women empowerment and gender reforms in particular, had filed the petition in 2019 in the wake of multiple incidents of blackmailing of women through release of CCTV footage or secretly filmed videos.  
On Thursday, Advocate Anas Mashood submitted that there were various incidents wherein the owners/staff of internet cafes or cinemas secretly recorded videos or photos of the activities of their customers by using night vision cameras or CCTV cameras.
He said the perpetrators uploaded the videos on websites or leaked to the general public through CDs/social media, which resulted in loss of life of many people but the culprits had not yet been identified, rather no stern action had been taken against them.
The counsel argued that the cybercrimes/online offences against the privacy of individuals grew every day which infringed the inviolable right of dignity of the citizens protected and guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution. He referred to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides a right to respect for one’s private and family life, his home and his correspondence, subject to certain restrictions that are in accordance with law and necessary in a democratic society.  
After hearing the arguments, Justice Jawad Hassan appointed Barrister Asad Raheem as amicus curiae to assist the court on the matter and allowed time to the respondents to file their replies by Jan 12, 2022.
Sufi in his petition pleads that the right of privacy, especially pertaining to personal information, is inherently compounded and recognised in the laws of Pakistan, but due to a lack of specific attribution it remains dormant with tacit ascriptions in other laws resulting in deprivation of liberty and dignity for the citizens.  
He asks the court to declare that the installation and operation of CCTV cameras at any place accessible to the general public without displaying proper notice or signage of the surveillance is unconstitutional and amounts to breach of privacy.

Official sources said the maintenance of parks and greenbelts in the city had been a daunting task for the civic authorities. 
They said Gujrat Metropolitan Corporation (GtMC) had so far been unable to properly look after these facilities because of shortage of human resource and technical staff, while local parks and greenbelts were being neglected since long. 
Currently, the city has at least four major parks, including the Shahbaz Sharif Park, spreading over 90 acres, the biggest in Gujranwala region. 
Besides, there is at least 46-kilometre-long infrastructure of greenbelts in various parts of the city, including a 14-kilometer-long stretch along the old GT Road passing through the city right from Kathala railway crossing to the Rehmania Bridge over Bhimbher storm water channel. 
Since the city’s population has swelled to around 0.5 million, lifting of solid waste and maintaining the sanitation system of the city have become a huge task for the GtMC, prompting the local administration to propose the establishment of PHA in Gujrat. 
The sources said senior PML-Q leader and federal minister for water resources Chaudhry Moonis Elahi had been briefed by the administration as well as the civic agencies on the need for setting up PHA in the city.  
Following the briefing, Mr Elahi had directed the authorities concerned to prepare a concrete proposal for the purpose, they added. 
In this connection, Gujrat Deputy Commissioner Mehtab Waseem Azhar recently sent a summary to Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, seeking approval for establishment of Gujrat PHA. 
The DC said in the summary that since Gujrat had been an important part of the ‘golden industrial triangle’ of Pakistan and had already become a metropolitan city of Punjab, there was a dire need to establish PHA here as the local civic agencies lacked the capacity to maintain parks and greenbelts in the city. 
He claimed Gujrat PHA would be a self-sustaining entity as annual expected expenditures of the agency would be around Rs63 million, while it would have an estimated income of around Rs70m. 
Earlier, the local administration had also proposed the establishment of Gujrat Solid Waste Management Company, keeping in view the rising population, urbanisation trends and industrial growth of the city.

The DSP added that the complainant had alleged that her niece who lived with her, was offered a job at a boutique by Laiba and when the complainant and her niece came to Gojra on Oct 11 for her interview as were told through a mobile phone message, Laiba and her two accomplices, Hammad and Rehman, both of Chak 288 JB, took her niece by a car to Faisalabad for the interview and during travelling, they gang-raped her. 
The DSP also said the FIR added that the accused later dropped her at Faisalabad interchange from where she returned to Gojra by a van. 
Later, the police arrested both accused men and the car was also impounded; however, during investigation, it was revealed that all the action was a drama to extort money from rich people and both the complainant and the alleged victim were actually members of the blackmailing gang.

“The ruling party in Punjab with a mala fide intention is trying to bring a system of local government according to its own whims and wishes, which can be controlled and influenced by it alone,” Mayor Razzaq Malik pleads in his petition filed through Advocate Awais Khalid.
He submits that the current government changed the faces of the elected representatives at first through the Act of 2019 indirectly which cannot be done directly and now the whole election scheme is being disrupted through the impugned ordinance.
He argues that the under the impugned law the chief minister has been given powers to take decisions or actions according to his own whims making the local government system redundant.
The mayor states that a new scheme of voting method through the EVMs has been imposed in the new law without an approval from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) that has already showed reservations on the use of machines.
He argues that the right of vote has been abbreviated as polling through technology without a proper training of the voters and even illiterate voters just to dictate the whole election process is against the spirit of free and fair elections.
The petitioner contends that the impugned actions of the government are ultra vires to the Constitution as the will of the people and their right to vote has been snatched by introducing provisions for the appointment of non-elected persons in the offices of local government.
He asks the court to set aside the impugned provisions of the ordinance for being in violation of the Constitution.

This was argued at a panel discussion on community-centric approaches to ending violence against women, organised by HomeNet Pakistan and United Nations Development Programme at a local hotel here on Thursday.
In her introductory remarks, Ammara Durrani, the UNDP Development Policy Unit assistant resident representative, shared that according to some estimates at least 70 per cent women faced some form of abuse from someone they knew in close proximity, adding that these numbers were just the tip of the iceberg as most cases went unreported.
Fauzia Viqar, a gender issues expert, explained that legislation and policy framework were in place to curb violence against women, but there was a need for strong institutional infrastructure, adequately resourcing and monitoring agencies responsible. Increased representation of women in agencies meant to protect them, and change in mindsets was needed to address the problem.
MPA Uzma Kardar emphasised that Pakistan was an over-legislated country, but implementation mechanism, lack of policy making and rules don’t match the number of laws in place. “If we continue at the same pace, it’ll take 136 years to close the gender gap in the country. We need a bottom-up approach, efforts must trickle down.”
She stressed the need for support groups, and also highlighted the women safety app developed by the Safe Cities Authority as a tool to get immediate relief.
Ume Laila Azhar, the executive director of HomeNet Pakistan, remarked that discrimination begins at home when sons and daughters are treated differently. She stressed the need for education about laws and rights, encouraging reporting of emotional and psychological abuse besides physical as well as community-centric approaches besides laws and policies.
Lawyer and rights activist Nighat Dad was of the view that cyber violence needed to be considered as abusive as other forms of violence against women. “We need to address cyber violence holistically for which political will is needed on government level. Until then no laws and accountability will be helpful,” she added.
AIG Asad Muzaffar pointed towards the need for increased representation of women in the judiciary and training in the police force. About low reporting of a gender-based crime, he called it a social issue that he said first needed to be admitted at home. He claimed that reporting on the police level was fully conducive and they were responding to every report.
Punjab Minister for Women Development Ashifa Riaz Fatyana, in her concluding remarks, suggested engaging lawyers in dealing with cases of gender-based violence. “Society’s attitudes need to change. Women in both rural and urban areas have started speaking up as they have become aware,” she suggested.

Its impact on Thursday, however, was felt by all: residents and travelers alike. By the time of writing these lines, Lahore-Sialkot, Lahore-Samundri and Lahore-Kot Momin sections of motorways were closed for all traffic.
Train traffic also suffered as Rehman Baba (Karachi-Peshawar) Express got late by four hours, Shah Hussain (Lahore-Karachi) Express by three hours, Green Line (Karachi-Rawalpindi) and Jaffar Express running between Peshawar and Quetta got delayed by 3.39 hours.
According to the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), the smog conditions improved and hot spots of the city ranged between 113 and 239. Amir Farooq of the EPA attributed these improved conditions to fog. “When size of the droplets increases, they trap particulate matter in them and clean air. Precipitation also clears the atmosphere. It was expected to happen and it did, to a large relief of people and the agency,” he says.  
The meterological officials say the minimum temperatures are expected to drop further on Friday when maximum of it would stay close to 13 degree Celsius and minimum may drop to four degree Celsius. These dry conditions would not only ensure continued cold but also add bite to it. “It may rain in upper parts of the country and the province but the plains of Punjab would keep suffering dry and cold conditions.
International agencies, however, disagreed with the EPA data, and placed Lahore air quality index at 348. Individual spots depicted even dangerous readings. At Kot Lakhpat Industrial area, the level was reported 573 – an extremely dangerous position. The US Consulate spot was 496, Gulberg at 486 and Model Town at 482.
It was not only Lahore, but other cities had their own share of smog severity. Faisalabad led with 454, Gujranwala 339 and Bahawalpur 256.

18,One-time age relaxation for PMS aspirants,Punjab govt failed to conduct test this year due to Covid,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has decided to allow one-time age relaxation to the candidates aspiring to appear for the Provincial Management Service (PMS) competitive examination to be conducted by the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC).  
The upper age limit for appearing in the PMS examination is 30.  
The PPSC chairman had initiated a summary requesting one-year age relaxation for the PMS examination aspiring candidates as the commission had not conducted the examination during the current year due to coronavirus pandemic. The chairman stated that many candidates would become ineligible, if one year relaxation was not given, and lose their right to appear for the competitive examination.  
An in-principle decision was taken at the Standing Committee of Cabinet on Legislative Business meeting chaired by Punjab Law Minister Basharat Raja at the Civil Secretariat on Thursday.  

Punjab govt failed to conduct test this year due to Covid  

The committee decided that the cut-off date for the next examination would be Jan 1, 2022. The committee will send its recommendations to the chief minister for his final nod.  
Sources say the committee was unanimous in giving one-year age relaxation to the aspiring candidates but there was a difference of opinion about the process to achieve the goal of one-year age relaxation. They say the regulations and law departments wanted that the government should relax rules for a period of three months and the relaxation should go back to its original position after three months i.e. on March 31 next.  
However, sources say, the additional chief secretary was of the view that a new rule should be added to allow one-year relaxation with the formal approval of the chief minister and the added rule would automatically wither away in three months i.e. March 31 next.  
It is learnt that eventually, the ACS’ point of view prevailed and the committee would now recommend to the chief minister to add a new rule to allow one-year age relaxation to the aspiring candidates. This relaxation will not serve as a precedent.
