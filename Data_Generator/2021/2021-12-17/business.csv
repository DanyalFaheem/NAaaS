Site Association of  Industry (SAI) president Abdul Rasheed in a press statement said that a  free-floating exchange rate works as a shock absorber which discourages  imports in a timely manner thereby keeping the current account in check.  The SBP in its latest Monetary Policy Statement has stated that the  inflation is due to supply-side issues and further fuelled by the higher  commodity prices and up to 70 per cent of the current account deficit  is due to rising global commodity prices.
He urged the SBP  to reverse the interest rate to 7pc as industries are already facing  severe losses due to gas closure coupled with one-sided minimum wage  notification.
Employers’  Federation of Pakistan president  Ismail Suttar said that the historic  trends of the past few decades are enough to prove that an increase in  interest rates has adversely affected Pakistan’s economy time and  again.

1,Oil prices likely to hit $150/barrel in 2022,Expert says last seven years have seen no investment in supply sector...,"KARACHI: Oil price in 2022 is expected to more than double to $150 per barrel, said Dr Salman Ahmed, head of macro and strategic asset allocation at Fidelity International, a global investment management firm. 
Speaking at the KTrade Annual Investor Summit on Thursday, Dr Ahmed said there has been no investment on the supply side in the last seven years while demand for oil is coming down “very gradually”. 
“The supply side is coming under pressure rapidly. We think oil needs to go higher for [its] demand to come down... This is a very competitive environment for oil consumers. Prices will remain high to incentivise pressure to move away from oil,” he said. 

Expert says last seven years have seen no investment in supply sector

Addressing the participants, KTrade Securities Managing Director Saad Bin Ahmed said valuations on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) are hovering at the 2001 level. 
The KSE-100 index is trading at a multiple of between 4.5 and five, he said while referring to the price-to-earnings ratio that shows the share prices of PSX-listed companies are currently undervalued relative to their profit per share. 
The benchmark is trading at a 50 per cent discount to its 10-year historical mean of eight, he said. “We expect the index to rise to 53,000 points in 2022,” he added. It means KTrade Securities — a brokerage that claims to have the most downloaded investment mobile application with over 200,000 registered users — sees an upside of 20pc in 2022 versus the current level of 43,000-44,000 points. “We project earnings growth of 12pc and a dividend yield of 6pc.” 
He added that the index has the potential to re-rate once the issues relating to the cash-starved energy chain are resolved. Referring to the recent revisions in energy tariffs, clearance of independent power producers’ receivables and the earmarking of Rs100 billion for the transmission network, he said earnings of the companies belonging to the energy chain have a high potential to grow. 
Currency depreciation and interest rate hikes have “significantly increased the cost of owning a car,” which will lead to a fall in the demand for automobiles in 2022. 
However, commercial banks will emerge as key winners because of a sharp rise in lending rates.

2,SBP reserves fall  by $90m,Rupee closed unchanged at 177.98 against the US dollar in the interbank market.,"KARACHI: Foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) fell by $90 million to $18.568 billion during the week ended on Dec 10, announced the central bank on Thursday.
However, the overall reserves of the country dipped by $123m to $25.027bn while the holdings of the commercial banks slipped by $33m to $6.459bn over the preceding week. Meanwhile, the rupee closed unchanged at 177.98 against the US dollar in the interbank market on Thursday.
The surging dollar price has been a constant worry for the government amid falling SBP reserves since there isn’t any evidence of exchange rate stability as the rupee remained under severe pressure due to strong demand for greenbacks.

6,Afghanistan slashes levy on Pakistani kinno,"Last season, kinno exports to Afghanistan remained at 85,000 tonnes.","LAHORE: The Afghan government has reduced import tax on Pakistani kinno from Rs1.3 million to Rs0.5m per container, a Commerce Ministry official said on Thursday.  
The issue had been taken up with the Afghan government after it was raised by kinno exporters, particularly members of the Sargodha Chambers of Commerce & Industry (SCCI), the official said.   
Kabul agreed to cut the levy by over 60 per cent, he added. 
SCCI president Shoaib Ahmad Basra hoped that kinno export to Afghanistan will cross the 100,000 tonnes mark earning foreign exchange for the national exchequer and boosting agricultural economy. 
Last season, kinno exports to Afghanistan remained at 85,000 tonnes. 
There was a nominal import tax on kinno imports in Afghanistan before the Ashraf Ghani government imposed Rs3.5 per kg levy on it last season. 
The Taliban government exorbitantly raised the tax to Rs33 per kg or Rs1.3m per container.

7,Smart device brand OPPO unveils  foldable flagship phone,It is the first time OPPO has exclusively brought their premium device in Pakistan at same time as global unveiling.,"LAHORE: A leading global smart device brand unveiled its foldable flagship phone, Oppo Find N at INNO Day 2021, here on Thursday claiming that the phone was immaculately designed after four years of research and six generations of prototypes until it matched company’s standard.  
“The phone we have showcased today is the first foldable phone by OPPO.

8,Half of CPP-run Punjab textile units stop production,SNGPL diverts gas supply to domestic consumers.,"LAHORE:  Production activities in half of the  entire textile export industry on Thursday came to a complete or partial  halt after the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd stopped gas supply to  the captive power plants (CPPs) compelling the industry to run on  electricity.
“Since  disconnection of gas supply to CPPs following rise in domestic sector’s demand, around 200 mills are partially or  completely closed that means we have almost no production from 50  per cent of our total textile exports industry producing raw material,  yarn, cloth, garments, etc. It is very bad,” deplores All Pakistan  Textile Mills Association (Aptma) chairman Abdul Rahim Nasir while talking to  Dawn on Thursday. 
The operation of large units  exclusively on electricity, according to industry, is difficult  since the steam that is used in dying and other processes cannot be  generated.

SNGPL diverts gas supply to domestic consumers

“Only the new machines, and not the used ones, can be  run effectively on electricity. But with captive power, all can be run  efficiently leading to the generation of steam and production as per demand. 
When  asked why the industry didn’t switch to electricity despite having  connections, he said it did, but it couldn’t work due to a 14-hour long  power shutdown caused by tripping of the respective grid stations. “This  disruption in gas supply coupled with a sudden drop in temperature and  high moisture in the air led to tripping of 132kV grid  stations and transmission lines in the industrial hubs. The situation  has chocked the production activity of the textile industry especially  in Punjab as mills close down their operations at the cost of losing  export  orders and retrenchment of labour,” he added.
Mr Nasir said the  millers were running from pillar to post in search of energy while the  relevant departments are inattentive to the issue as usual, leaving  Aptma with no option but to ask the prime minister to intervene. 
He further said  the Punjab-based industry was hit with a double whammy, ie, an increase  in gas tariff from $6.5 to $9 per mmBtu and loadshedding of gas. “I think  that the Punjab industry is being discriminated against other provinces,  which would be detrimental to the overall growth of the national  economy in the long run.”
On the other hand, a spokesman for the  SNGPL dispelled the impression stating that of the total 2,300 industrial  units/gas consumers, 1,900 are being supplied uninterrupted gas. “We  have only disconnected gas supply to 400 industrial units operating on  CPPs,” the spokesman clarified. 
He said such units should use  electricity since the respective power distribution companies have  sufficient electricity for them at cheaper rates.
Meanwhile, Energy Minister Hammad Azhar in a tweet on Thursday said the  process gas is being supplied uninterrupted to textile. “Only the gas  that they were using for captive power plants has been curtailed.
