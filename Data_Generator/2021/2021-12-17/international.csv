0,France bans most UK travel as fears over Omicron mount,EU drug regulators approve Pfizer’s Covid pill for emergency use by member states.,"PARIS: France said on Thursday that it would ban non-essential travel to and from Britain in a bid to keep the Omicron Covid-19 variant in check, as European leaders urged coordinated action and more booster shots to counter the more highly contagious threat.
Countries worldwide have begun advising against foreign travel while ramping up domestic restrictions to battle Omicron, even though scientists remain uncertain how dangerous it is.
Britain has seen case levels explode in recent weeks to record levels amid fears the variant could overwhelm hospitals during the dinners and parties for the year-end holidays.
Starting at midnight, the French government said, travellers will need  “an essential reason to travel to, or come from, the UK, both for the unvaccinated and vaccinated... People cannot travel for touristic or professional reasons.” It added that French citizens and EU nationals could still return to France from the UK, but they will now need a negative Covid test less than 24 hours old, and a blanket quarantine will be enforced upon their return.
The Spanish government said meanwhile that boosters would soon be available for everyone aged 40 and older, down from 65 and older currently.
EU drug regulators on Thursday also approved Pfizer’s Covid pill for emergency use by member states struggling with the new coronavirus wave.
In France, the  “drastic” new limits on travel to Britain aim to give the country time to give 20 million booster jabs by Christmas — and the country may soon open up vaccinations to children aged 5 to 11.
“People (coming back) will have to register on an app and will have to self-isolate in a place of their choosing for seven days — controlled by the security forces — but this can be shortened to 48 hours if a negative test is carried out in France,” government spokesman Gabriel Attal said.
Britain on Thursday recorded a record 88,376 laboratory-confirmed Covid cases, with scientists predicting even higher rates as Omicron is believed to spread much faster than the currently dominant Delta variant.

1,Five children killed in Australia bouncy castle tragedy,Prime Minister Scott Morrison says incident was “just shattering” and “unthinkably heartbreaking”.,"SYDNEY: Five schoolchildren were killed and several others were seriously injured when a gust of wind blew their bouncy castle into the air at an end-of-term party in Australia on Thursday.
Police said the pupils at a primary school in Devonport, northern Tasmania were celebrating the last week of class before the Christmas break when they were thrown from a height of about 10 metres (33 feet).
Earlier police confirmed two boys and two girls from grades five and six — typically aged about 10-12 years old — were killed in the incident, with a fifth student later dying in hospital.
Several rescue helicopters and ambulances rushed to the scene after the incident, which occurred around 10 am local time on an otherwise sunny, early summer day.
Images from the school showed attending police officers in tears, and a swathe of blue tarpaulin sheets shielding what officers described as  “a very confronting and distressing scene”.
A police investigation is under way. Distraught witnesses, friends, family, teachers and first responders are being offered counselling. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the incident was  “just shattering” and  “unthinkably heartbreaking”.
“Young children on a fun day out, together with their families and it turns to such horrific tragedy, at this time of year, it just breaks your heart,” he said.
“I just want to say, to the parents and families and friends, all who were there, to the other young children there and witnessing these events, I just pray you’ll have great family around you and great friends and you can come through this horrific tragedy.” The school had invited parents to volunteer for the event, which featured a wet play zone, a slide, an arts and crafts area, zorb balls and the bouncy castle.
“The purpose for the day is to celebrate a successful year and enjoy some fun activities with classmates,” the school, Hillcrest Primary, posted on its Facebook page.
That post was followed by the update:  “There has been an accident on site at our school. We are closing the school for the rest of the day.” 
“We ask that parents come to collect their children as a matter of urgency.” The school has around 200 students Local weather services had forecast  “light winds” for the area, which sits on Tasmania’s rugged north coast, looking out across the frigid Bass Strait.

2,Hundreds flee to Thailand as Myanmar junta clashes with rebels,Clashes come a day after state media reported junta troops entered KNU territory and arrested several dissidents.,"YANGON: Hundreds of Myanmar villagers have fled to Thailand after junta troops clashed with an ethnic rebel group, officials said on Thursday.
Fighting between Karen National Union (KNU) and the military broke out on Wednesday in the town of Lay Kay Kaw near the Thai border — the first such clashes in months.
On Thursday, photos by local media showed dozens of people lining up to cross a river that forms part of the border. A Thai government official in Tak province said 700 people had crossed the border, and would be given food and shelter.
Naw K’nyaw Paw, general secretary at the Karen Women’s Organisation, said that more than 1,000 had been allowed to cross after community leaders negotiated with Thai authorities.
“I heard small arms fire and heavy artillery,” said one local from a village near Lay Kay Kaw.
“More people have arrived in our village and there are about 3,000 hiding here now.” The clashes broke out on Wednesday, a day after state media reported junta troops entered KNU territory and arrested several dissidents, including a former lawmaker from Aung San Suu Kyi’s ousted government.
The group’s fighters had since injured and killed junta troops, said Padoh Saw Thamain Tun of the KNU, without providing details.
This news agency could not verify the claims and the junta did not respond to requests for comment.
The KNU has been a vocal opponent of the coup and provided shelter to dissidents working to oust the junta.
Its fighters have clashed sporadically with the Myanmar military along the Thai border.
In March, its fighters seized a military post and the army retaliated with air raids, the first in more than 20 years in Karen state.
Myanmar has more than 20 ethnic rebel groups, many of whom hold territories in the country’s border regions.

3,Migrants defy police to make perilous Channel crossing,Police were outnumbered and seemed resigned.,"WIMEREUX: In the early hours of Thursday on a beach in northern France, a small group of police with torches tries to stand in the way of dozens of migrants heading for the sea carrying a grey dinghy.
It’s tense. The police are outnumbered. The migrants — who hope to make it to Britain on the final stretch of their long journeys fleeing war and poverty — are screaming. They eventually push past the police, who stand aside.
“Thank you, thank you,” says one woman, blowing kisses in the direction of the police.
The migrants, including children, some bundled up against the cold in jackets and woollen hats, some crying, jump onto the dinghy and head out into the Channel — one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes — towards the coast of England.
The arrival of migrants on rickety boats has been a growing source of tension between France and Britain, especially after 27 migrants drowned last month.
Britain says France is not doing enough to police its beaches, while France accuses Britain of having lax labour laws that entice illegal immigrants.
On the beach in Wimereux, near Calais, the police — about 10 — seem resigned.  “They just want to go to England, that’s it,” one said of the group of mostly Kurdish migrants.
During the standoff, some of the migrants shouted:  “Help us we want go to UK, please!” When a small group stepped out of the sand dunes with the dinghy, others stepped in front of the police to block their way and allow the boat to reach the water.
“I have a dream, go UK, I have a dream, I have a wish,” one migrant said.
Some of the migrants gave up, fearing the overloaded dinghy was too risky.
A while later, another dinghy, with about 40 people on board, set out from the same beach.

4,South Asia remains deadliest region for journalists,WASHINGTON: Two of the four deadliest countries for journalists — Afghanistan and India — are from South Asia...,"WASHINGTON: Two of the four deadliest countries for journalists — Afghanistan and India — are from South Asia while the situation in Pakistan has slightly improved, says a report released on Thursday. 
The findings are included in the World Press Freedom Index 2021, which was compiled by Reporters Sans Frontiers (RSF), an international media advocacy group.  
The index evaluates the situation for journalists each year in 180 countries and territories. 
The 2021 report notes that a total of 46 journalists were killed across the globe this year, which is the lowest in 20 years. At least 50 journalists were killed in 2020. 
“Despite this remarkable fall, an average of nearly one journalist a week is still being killed in connection with their work,” the 2021 report adds. 
However, the number of journalists detained in connection with their work “has never been this high since RSF began publishing its annual round-up in 1995”, the report warns. The RSF logged a total of 488 journalists and media workers in prison in mid-December 2021, or 20 per cent more than at the same time last year. 
The RSF has established that 65 per cent of the journalists killed in 2021 were deliberately targeted and eliminated. Mexico and Afghanistan are again the two deadliest countries, with seven journalists killed in Mexico and six in Afghanistan. Yemen and India share the third place, with four journalists killed in each country. 
One journalist was killed in Pakistan. 
The RSF has also never previously registered so many female journalists in prison, with a total of 60 currently detained in connection with their work — a third (33 per cent) more than at this time last year. 
On the freedom index, Pakistan retained the 145th position, as it did in 2020. Pakistan was 142 out of 180 in 2019, 139 in 2017 and 147 in 2016. 
The 2021 RSF report on Pakistan points out that the Pakistani media, which have a long tradition of being very lively, have become a priority target for the country’s ‘deep state’, which “exercises a significant degree of control over the civilian executive”. 
The influence of the establishment over the media “has increased dramatically since Imran Khan became prime minister in July 2018,” the report adds. 
It cites various cases of “brazen censorship” through methods such as restricting distribution of newspapers, threats to withdraw advertising and jamming television signals. 
“Journalists who dared to broach subjects deemed off limits” by the establishment “have been subjected to harassment campaigns,” the report says. “Several were abducted in 2020 in order to be told: ‘Stop covering unwelcome stories or your family won’t find you alive.” 
The report says that after reining in the traditional media, the establishment has set about purging the Internet and social media of content not to its liking. 
With four journalists killed in connection with their work in 2020, 
The report classifies India as “one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists trying to do their job properly”. At least four journalists were killed in India in 2020. 
Journalists in India “are exposed to every kind of attack, including police violence against reporters, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials,” the report adds. 
The RSF notes that “ever since the general elections in the spring of 2019, won overwhelmingly by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, pressure has increased on the media to toe the Hindu nationalist government’s line”. 
The report says that “Indians who espouse Hindutva, the ideology that gave rise to radical right-wing Hindu nationalism, are trying to purge all manifestations of ‘anti-national’ thought from the public debate”. 
The coordinated hate campaigns waged on social networks against journalists who dare to speak or write about subjects that annoy Hindutva followers “are terrifying and include calls for the journalists concerned to be murdered,” the report adds.

6,"Afghan women protest for right to education, employment opportunities","“Food, careers and freedom,” participants chanted, while others held placards demanding women get political posts.","KABUL: Dozens of women protested on Thursday in Afghanistan’s capital, demanding the right to education, jobs and political representation from the Taliban government. Although public protests are effectively banned by Afghanistan’s Islamist rulers, authorities gave permission for the march — held in biting cold after the first snowfall of winter in Kabul. 
“Food, careers and freedom,” participants chanted, while others held placards demanding women get political posts. Some protesters carried banners echoing Taliban complaints that the international community had frozen billions of dollars in aid and assets. 
The Taliban have pledged a softer rule, compared with their first stint in power in the 1990s, but women are still largely excluded from government employment and secondary school education. 
Despite being permitted to protest, participants said they remained in fear of the country’s current rulers. At one intersection Taliban fighters cocked and raised their weapons, but the march was allowed to continue. 
“Fear is always there, but we cannot live in fear — we have to fight against our fear,” said 28-year-old Shahera Kohistan. 
For weeks after the Taliban takeover of government, women staged almost daily protests to demand their rights, representation in government and roles in the deeply religious and conservative country, but following a violent crackdown on demonstrations, such street rallies waned.
