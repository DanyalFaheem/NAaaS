He said Skardu airport was previously used only for domestic flights. However, its status was elevated on December 2 when it began welcoming international flights as well.
Addressing a large crowd at Municipal Stadium in Skardu, the prime minister said the facility’s elevation to international airport would bring untold changes for the locals.
Earlier, Prime Minister Khan inaugurated Skardu International Airport and Jaglot-Skardu road during his day-long visit to GB.
Highlighting tourism potential of GB, he said he had widely travelled the world but nowhere seen a splendid mountainous range like that of GB.
The premier said GB had the most beautiful mountainous scenery in the world but lamented that people did not know enough about it because travel to the region was difficult.
He predicted that tourists, including overseas Pakistanis and domestic tourists, would arrive here in large numbers after the upgrade of the airport and construction of the road.
“Tourism can become a big asset of Pakistan,” he said. “If Switzerland can earn $70 billion from tourism, Pakistan can also generate substantial income from tourism. We can earn at least $30billion to $40bn from tourism just in GB.”
The prime minister also highlighted religious tourism and untapped potential of coastal belt of the country. “We have not taken benefit of the blessings God has granted us,” he said.
He said the locals would benefit the most from surge in tourism as they would no longer have to venture far to seek jobs. Instead, people would come to their area to find jobs.
The prime minister advised the locals not to sell their land to outsiders.
“The people of GB will soon witness an unprecedented era of prosperity with revenue generation and creation of employment opportunities through tourism, he said.
Explaining his vision, he said that no country could truly develop until it elevated its poor people and improved its backward and neglected areas. “It is my desire that by the time our five years [in government] are over, the life in backward areas is better and the lives of people below the poverty line are improved.”
Imran Khan lauded the National Highway Authority and the Frontier Works Organisation for completion of Jaglot-Skardu road project.
He said a country could not progress unless it uplifted its neglected and unprivileged segments of the society.
The prime minister said he was giving priority to development of the areas that lacked facilities of communication and health, including G-B, Balochistan, erstwhile tribal areas and southern Punjab.
He said a society was known for its socio-economic justice where poor and rich had access to basic facilities of life.
The PM said his government had taken a number of steps for welfare of the masses and added that he wanted a major improvement in the lives of the underprivileged on completion of his tenure.
He said from today, the government had initiated provision of basic food items on subsidised rates. 
Work on expanding the network of universal health insurance of Rs1 million for a household was underway after its launch in Khyber Pukhtunkhwa, he said.
Earlier speaking on the occasion, GB Chief Minister Khalid Khurshid Khan said the prime minister had approved many projects to meet power and road needs of the region.
After completion of Gilgit-Shandur road and Shontor tunnel projects, he said, GB would have road connectivity with rest of the country through three roads.
He thanked Prime Minister Imran Khan for visiting the region amid harsh weather conditions.
GB Governor Raja Jalal Hussain Maqpoon, Speaker of GB Legislative Assembly Amjad Ali Zaidi, Deputy Speaker Nazir Ahmed, members of the GB cabinet and assembly, PTI workers and a large number of people from all districts of GB participated in the event.

1,21pc women of 20-24 years in Balochistan married before their 18th birthday: report,Makran has the highest prevalence of under 18-year girl marriage at 23pc.,"QUETTA: More than 21 per cent women of 20-24 years are married in Balochistan before reaching their 18th birthday whereas about 6pc are married before 15 years of age.
The Population Council, with support of the United Nations Population Fund, carried out a Political Economy Analysis (PEA) on child marriage in Pakistan with focus on Balochistan.
According to a report on Thursday, Makran has the highest prevalence of under 18-year girl marriage (23pc), followed closely by Nasirabad (22.4pc) and Sibi division (22pc).
Quetta division has the least reported percentages of both under-15 and under-18 years girl child marriage at 2.6pc and 11pc, respectively.
The report highlights prevalence of girl child marriage belonging to poorer families (22.4pc). Both under-15 and under-18 year marriage prevalence declines if girls have attained the highest level of education.
The report explores the political, religious and socio-cultural factors behind the incidence of child marriage in Balochistan. It also provides evidence for the adoption of necessary policy interventions, including the enactment and implementation of the Child Marriage Restraint Act.
Balochistan Minister for Food Zmarak Khan, senior government officials from the Balochistan social welfare, human rights, women development, law, health and population welfare departments, civil society representatives, academia, health practitioners and the media atended the launch of the report.
Speaking on the occasion,  Zmarak Khan urged legislators, political parties, civil society and the media to collectively work towards creating a conducive environment for girls’ education and socio-economic inclusion. 
He said: “This landmark report, analysing the political economy of child marriage, will not only contribute to comprehensive legislation to prevent the practice in the province but also act as a catalyst for further research, advocacy, and policy change on this critical issue.”

4,ECP to consult parties on barcoded ballots,Election to a Senate seat will be held on 20th on conventional basis.,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commi­ssion of Pakistan (ECP) has decided to consult political parties on the use of barcoded ballot papers for Senate elections in line with the Supreme Court’s opinion against absolute secrecy. 
Informed sources told Dawn that the commission, which met here to discuss the use of technology to make votes identifiable to curb horse-trading, decided to conduct the election for a Senate seat scheduled for Dec 20 through conventional method. 
A source privy to the development said the commission at one stage considered the option of printing coded information on ballot papers for the Dec 20 Senate election that could only be read by a scanner through a software developed by the ECP. 
But during deliberations, a scenario was envisioned where the lawmakers ref­use to vote using barcoded ballot pap­ers and it was finally decided to consult political parties on the use of technology to make votes polled for Senate elections identifiable when a need arises. 

Election to a Senate seat will be held on 20th on conventional basis

“A solution is already there as a software has been developed by the ECP to read scannable information from the ballot papers in March,” an ECP official told Dawn. He, however, said the ECP was of the view that a political consensus was essential before the system was put to use. 
The Supreme Court had before the Senate polls held in March this year observed that declaring secrecy of the ballot was not absolute and asked the ECP to take all available measures, including the use of latest technology, to guard against corrupt practices during Senate elections. 
“In order to achieve the mandate of the ECP in terms of Article 218(3), read with Article 220 and other enabling provisions of the Constitution and law, the ECP is required to take all available measures, including utilising technologies to fulfil the solemn constitutional duty. 
“[This solemn duty is about ensuring] that the election is conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with law and that corrupt practices are guarded against,” said a five-judge SC bench while giving its opinion on a presidential reference. 
Through the reference filed in December 2020, the federal government had asked the apex court whether the Senate elections are held “under the Constitution” or under the Elections Act, 2017. 
According to most legal experts, the phrase “under the Constitution” refers to Article 226 of the Constitution which says all elections under the Consti­tution, other than those of the prime minister and the chief minister, shall be held through secret ballot. 
The four-one majority opinion was announced by the five-member bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Gulzar Ahmed and comprising Justice Mushir Ala, Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijazul Ahsan and Justice Yahya Afridi. 
Justice Afridi had disagreed with the majority opinion, observing that “the opinion sought by the Worthy President, Islamic Republic of Pakistan in the instant Reference, is not a question of law within the contemplation of Article 186 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973”. Therefore, he abstained from giving an opinion on the reference. 
Meanwhile, the election to fill a Senate seat from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will be held on Dec 20. 
The seat fell vacant after PTI lawmaker Ayub Afridi’s resignation to pave the way for election of Adviser to the Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Tarin to become finance minister again. 
The government had previously tried to get former finance minister Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, who was also not a member of parliament, elected to the Senate. 
Mr Shaikh was appointed as finance minister in December 2020 and was the government’s candidate for the hotly contested general seat from Islamabad in March’s Senate elections. 
But in a blow to the government, Mr Shaikh lost the election to the joint opposition’s candidate Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani, a result which led PM Imran Khan to seek a vote of confidence from the National Assembly to show that he still held the majority.

5,"MQM plans bloodshed, alleges Saeed Ghani",Sindh minister claims the government has heeded all recommendations of governor in the amended local govt law.,"ISLAMABAD: Lashing out at the opposition parties for agitating over the recently passed Sindh Local Government (Amendment) Bill 2021, provincial Minister for Information and Broadcasting Saeed Ghani on Thursday alleged that the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) had planned bloodshed in the province through ethnic violence. 
Speaking at a news conference with media coordinator of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Nazir Dhoki here, Mr Ghani alleged that the urban Sindh-based MQM had hatched a conspiracy to create unrest in the province on the issue of the local government law as it wanted to “revive its old politics”. 
“By making the LG law as the ground, the MQM wants ethnic riots in the province so that its old politics is revived,” said the Sindh minister, while justifying the recent changes made in the LG law by the provincial government last week. 
Mr Ghani criticised the MQM for hanging banners across Karachi streets inscribed with controversial slogans like Karachi ke hospitals par gher maqamion ka qabza namanzoor (Say no to occupation of Karachi hospitals by non-locals) and Karachi shehr par Sindhi dehi ilaqon ka qabza namanzoor (Say no to occupation of Karachi city by rural Sindh people). He asked the MQM to define and explain the term “locals and non-locals”. 

Sindh minister claims the government has heeded all recommendations of governor in the amended local govt law

“This is a dangerous thing. This is a poison which is being intentionally poured into the minds of the people. They [MQM] want ethnic riots and want to see people dying from both the sides so that they can again start their politics by telling the Urdu-speaking people that look, we are here to save you,” said Mr Ghani, alleging that the MQM was still following the philosophy of its founder chairman Altaf Hussain.  
The PPP minister said the MQM had never been sincere to the people of Karachi and it had always exploited their sentiments. 
Mr Ghani recalled that when the MQM was a coalition partner of the PPP at the Centre in the past, it had quit the ruling alliance four times over the issue of increase in oil prices. On the other hand, he said, the MQM has now kept a mum despite repeated increases in the prices of oil, electricity and gas by the present coalition government under the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). 
“Why they [MQM] have now sealed their lips?” asked Mr Ghani, who also criticised the PTI for opposing the Sindh LG law which, he said, had been amended on the recommendations of the opposition parties. 
Mr Ghani claimed that the Sindh government had accommodated all objections and recommendations of Governor Imran Ismail in the amended law and now the governor had no right to oppose it. 
He also accused the Sindh governor of “playing politics” over the issue, saying the latter had sent the recommendations to the government after discussing the matter only with the opposition members. 
The minister dispelled an impression that the law had reduced powers of the local government institutions. Instead, he said, at least 10 major subjects had been handed over to the local governments. He said that under the new law, the mayor would now head the Karachi Sewerage Board and Solid Waste Management. 
He, however, said it was true that the Sindh government had taken control of a few hospitals, dispensaries and educational institutions, but the main purpose of the move was to improve facilities for the people. He said the Sindh government would have to spend huge money on improving the condition of these hospitals and schools which had been running under the Karachi Municipal Corporation.  
He said the Sindh government believed that Karachi Institute of Heart Diseases could be brought on a par with NICVD by improving its conditions. Similarly, he said, the condition of 750-bed Abbasi Shaheed Hospital would also be improved. 
The PPP leader alleged that the PTI and the MQM were making a hue and cry over the LG law because they knew that the people would reject them in the upcoming elections. 
Mr Ghani said two major incidents — separation of East Pakistan and terror attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar — had taken place on December 16 which could not be investigated. 
He also expressed concern over non-availability of gas to the people of Sindh, especially Karachi. He said the industries had closed in Karachi.
